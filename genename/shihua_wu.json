        "abstract": "SnO 2 hollow spheres/polythiophene hybrid materials were synthesized by an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method, and characterized by Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). It is proved that there is a strong synergetic interaction between the SnO 2 hollow spheres and polythiophene, and the hybrid materials had higher thermal stability than pure polythiophene, which is beneficial for potential application as chemical sensors. Gas sensing tests showed that the gas sensor based on the as-obtained hybrids had high sensor response and good selectivity, as well as comparatively short recovery time to NO 2 at a working temperature of 90 \u00b0C. The enhanced gas sensing performance of the hybrids is due to the high surface area of the hybrids and the p\u2013n heterojunction formed between p-type polythiophene and n-type SnO 2 hollow spheres.",

CuO was in non-crystal form in the CuO\u2013CeO 2 composite. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis of the CuO\u2013CeO 2 composite indicated a two-step reduction and the possible presence of reduced copper species.

The CuO/TiO2 catalysts with porous microspheres composed of TiO2 nanocrystals as the support were prepared by impregnation method. The properties of the porous TiO2 microspheres and CuO/TiO2 catalysts were studied by TG-DTA, X-ray diffraction, XPS and ICP. The catalytic properties of the catalysts for CO oxidation were studied via a microreactor-GC system. The results show that the porous microspheres were mainly composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with a size of 19.5 nm. The XPS results indicate that there was interaction between the support and the active component, and Cu mainly existed as Cu2+ with some other form. The catalytic activity of the catalysts depends on the concentration of the impregnation solution and the calcination temperature of the CuO/TiO2 catalysts. The catalyst impregnated in 0.5 mol/L Cu (NO3)2\u00b73H2O had a better catalytic activity. The optimum calcination temperature of the CuO/TiO2 catalysts was 200\u00b0C.",

The composites were used for gas sensing to methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), acetone, and NO x at different working temperature. It was found that PTP/SnO 2 materials with different PTP mass percent (1%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 30%) could detect NO x with very higher selectivity and sensitivity at much lower working temperature than the reported SnO 2 . The PTP/SnO 2 nanocomposites responded to NO x at concentration as low as 10 ppm. PTP/SnO 2 composite containing 5 mass% PTP showed the highest sensitivity at room temperature. The sensing mechanism of PTP/SnO 2 nanocomposites to NO x was presumed to be the effects of p\u2013n heterojunction between PTP and SnO 2 .",

Several SMAI Co-Pd catalysts with different metal contents were prepared. These catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and magnetic measurement. Compared with catalysts prepared by common impregnation (CI) method, the particle sizes of the metal in SMAI catalysts were much smaller. The contents of zero-valent state metallic Co and Pd in SMAI catalysts were higher than those in CI catalysts. The Co atoms were enriched on the surface for SMAI catalysts, whereas the Co atom concentration on the surface was essentially the same as in the bulk for CI catalysts. The catalytic activity of SMAI catalysts was much greater than that of CI catalysts with the same composition in hydrogenation of diacetone alcohol and O2 reduction on fuel cell electrodes.",

The products were characterized by means of IR, XRD, TEM and magnetization measurements. TEM pattern of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant shows irregular shape with particle size of around 380\u00b150 nm, while the TEM pictures of the products modified by SDS, HPC, DBS and CTAB show fine hexagonal, rhombohedral, subround and hexagonallike shape, respectively, and the corresponding particle size is about 230, 150, 240 and 260 nm, respectively. In addition, although the four products modified by different surfactants all exhibit weak ferromagnetic properties at room temperature, the coercivity values possess obvious change.

The results showed that (1) the mean Au particle size of Au/SnO2 catalyst prepared at pH = 9-10 deposition condition was the smallest among the samples obtained at different deposition pH; (2) the catalytic activity decreased with the increase of Au loading; (3) among the 2% Au/SnO2 catalyst samples calcined at different temperatures in air for 4 h, the catalytic activity of the sample calcined at 473 K was the highest; (4) the catalyst samples pretreated at low temperature in H2 exhibited higher activity, and the activity of the sample obtained at 373 K for 2 h was the highest among all Au/SnO2 samples in this work.",

MnO2 nanowires induce the 1D polymerization of pyrrole monomers and the simultaneous dissolution of the templates affords the hollow tube-like structure. The loading content of metal nanoparticles in the nanocomposites could be adjusted by simply changing the amount of metal precursors.

The ZnO shell coated on the nanospindles has a thickness of 10-15nm. Considering that both \u03b1-Fe2O3 and ZnO are good sensing materials, we have investigated the gas sensing performances of the core-shell nanocomposite using ethanol as the main probe gas. It is interesting to find that the gas sensor properties of the core-shell nanospindles are significantly enhanced compared with pristine \u03b1-Fe2O 3. The enhanced sensor properties are attributed to the unique core-shell nanostructure. The detailed sensing mechanism is discussed with respect to the energy band structure and the electron depletion theory. The core-shell nanostructure reported in this work provides a new path to fabricate highly sensitive materials for gas sensing applications. \u00a9 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The gas sensitivities in CO, H2, NH 3, ethanol or acetone atmospheres were determined at 30 C, 60 C and 90 C. FT-IR and XRD patterns suggest that ferric oxide in the hybrids was \u03b3-Fe2O3, with a diameter of approximately 5 nm. TG-DTA and HRTEM analyses showed that different reactant molar ratios of pyrrole monomer: Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O resulted in different microstructures of \u03b3-Fe2O3 and molecular weights of PPy. An increased amount of Fe(NO3)3\u00b7 9H2O increased the degree of uniformity of the molecular weight of PPy and resulted in a change of \u03b3-Fe2O3 microstructure from granular to stick particles. The results of gas sensitivities showed that the PPy/\u03b3-Fe2O3 hybrids exhibited high sensitivity to NH3 at mild operating temperature (<100 C). Furthermore, the sensing mechanism was also discussed. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Noble metal nanoparticles with a small size capped by lysine are formed and simultaneously anchored onto the surface of ZnO. No pre-functionalization of the ZnO support is needed, hence simplifying the synthesis and reducing the fabrication cost. Inspired by the catalytic properties of Au nanoparticles in both catalyst and sensor materials, we have examined the gas sensing performances towards ethanol detection. Obtained results demonstrate that after decoration by Au nanoparticles, the sensor shows significantly enhanced sensing performances in terms of high sensitivity, fast response and recovery, excellent reproducibility and good selectivity. The improved sensor properties are probably ascribed to the catalytic Au promoters and the Schottky barriers at the metal and semiconductor interface.",

        "title": "Synthesis and characterization of CuO/TiO2 catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation",
        "abstract": "In this paper, the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts prepared by the deposition\u2013precipitation (DP) method were extensively investigated for CO oxidation reaction. The structural characters of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts were comparatively investigated by TG-DTA, XRD, and XPS measurements. It was shown that the catalytic behavior of CuO/TiO 2 catalysts greatly depended on the TiO 2 -support calcination temperature, the CuO loading amount and the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts calcination temperature. CuO supported on the anatase phase of TiO 2 -support calcined at 400 \u00b0C showed better catalytic activity than those supported on TiO 2 calcined at 500 and 700 \u00b0C. Among all our investigated catalysts with CuO loading from 2% to 12%, the catalyst with 8 wt% CuO loading exhibited the highest catalytic activity. The optimum calcination temperature of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts was 300 \u00b0C. The XRD results indicated that the catalytic activity of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts was related to the crystal phase and particle size of TiO 2 support and CuO active component. Keywords Sol\u2013gel method CuO/TiO 2 catalyst Low-temperature CO oxidation Deposition\u2013precipitation method 1 Introduction CO as the major toxic air pollutant, which is usually emitted by products of combustion processes from industrial, transportation and domestic activities, is always the central issues in the environmental protection field. Many noble metal catalysts such as Pd/SnO 2 , Pt/SnO 2 , Au/MnO x , Au/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 and Au/Co 3 O 4 have been demonstrated to be very effective in CO oxidation [1\u20135] . Due to high prices and scarce of noble metal, attention has been given to search an alternative catalytic component to reduce using or even replace the noble metal. Transition metals supported on some oxides are good substitute catalysts because of their low-price and wide use. Among them, copper or copper oxide can exhibit activities per unit surface area similar to those of noble metal catalysts such as platinum [6] in CO oxidation. Moreover, TiO 2 is also an attractive support material from a practical point of view. Hence, the CuO/TiO 2 was chosen for low-temperature CO oxidation activity [7] . In this paper, we presented the catalytic studies of CuO/TiO 2 catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. The preparation method of the catalysts and their characterization by TG-DTA, XRD, XPS were described. The catalytic activity of the catalysts with different CuO content was tested. Meanwhile the correlation between their catalytic properties and the calcination temperature of the TiO 2 -support and CuO/TiO 2 catalysts were investigated systematically. 2 Experimental 2.1 TiO 2 preparation TiO 2 -support was synthesized by the sol\u2013gel method. A Ti-containing solution was first prepared by adding 15 ml Ti(OBu) 4 to 45 ml absolute alcohol at a volume ratio of 1/3 and stirred for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous light yellow solution. In a separate beaker, the nitric acid was added drop-wise to 15 ml distilled water and 60 ml ethanol (v/v = 1:4) until pH 1 forming a mixed solvent. The former light yellow solution was added slowly to the mixed solvent and stirred for another 30 min. Thereafter the obtained sol was aged at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting gel was dried at 80 \u00b0C in water bath for 1 h until most of the ethanol was evaporated, and then dried at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h in an oven to remove ethanol completely. The as-synthesized material was then calcined in air at 350, 400, 500, 600 and 700 \u00b0C, respectively, for 3 h. 2.2 Catalysts preparation The CuO/TiO 2 catalysts were prepared by the deposition-precipitation (DP) method. At room temperature, 0.5 g TiO 2 powders were firstly suspended in the aqueous solution of an appropriate amount of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 3H 2 O, then, 0.25 mol/L Na 2 CO 3 solution was gradually added to the above suspended solution until the pH of the mixed solution reached 9.0. The mixture was stirred for another 1 h, then filtered and washed with distilled water. The resulting solid was dried at 80 \u00b0C for 4 h and subsequently calcined at 350, 400, 500, 600 and 700 \u00b0C, respectively, for 3 h. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a D/MAX-RAX diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 100 mA, using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (scanning range 2 \u03b8 : 20\u201375\u00b0). The diffraction peaks of the crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA)were performed by a ZRY-2P thermal analyser. The thermograms were recorded from ambient temperature to 1173 K at a linear heating rate of 10 K/min under nitrogen atmosphere flowing at a rate of 40 ml/min. \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 was used as reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a Perkin\u2013Elmer PHI 5600 spectrophotometer with the Mg K\u03b1 radiation. The operating conditions were kept constantly at 187.85 eV and 250.0 W. In order to subtract the surface charging effect, the C1s peak has been fixed at a binding energy of 284.6 eV. 2.4 Measurement of catalytic activity Catalytic activity tests were performed in a continuous-flow fixed-bed microreactor. A stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 16 mm was chosen as the reactor tube. About 100 mg catalyst power was placed into the tube. The reaction gas mixture consisting of 1 vol% CO balanced with air was passed through the catalyst bed at a total flow rate of 33.4 ml/min. A typical weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 20040 mL h \u22121 g \u22121 . After 30 min reaction, the effluent gases were analyzed online by a GC-508A gas chromatograph. The activity was expressed by the conversion of CO. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 TG-DTA analysis of TiO 2 Fig. 1 shows the DTA-TG curves of the TiO 2 -support. The DTA curve of TiO 2 showed a small endothermic peak below 140 \u00b0C, where a weight-loss occurred in its TG curve. This peak could be due to the evaporation and removal of the surface adsorbed water and ethanol. The exothermic peaks between 140 and 170 \u00b0C resulted from the burning of the organic substance n -butanol, etc. The obvious endothermic peaks between 180 and 350 \u00b0C were caused by the burning of surplus carbon. This is in agreement with the results of the activity measurements. The exothermic peak centered at 400 \u00b0C resulted from the phase transition of TiO 2 from amorphous to anatase. No obvious decalescence phenomenon was observed above 500 \u00b0C in DTA curve. This indicated that the phase transition from anatase to rutile was gradually finished, which corresponded with the XRD results. 3.2 XRD analysis of TiO 2 and CuO/TiO 2 3.2.1 XRD analysis of TiO 2 To study the influence of the crystal phase transition of titania on the catalytic activity of the catalysts, the X-ray powder diffraction was used to determine the crystal phase of titania at different temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the TiO 2 -support prepared using sol\u2013gel process and calcined in the temperature range from 350 to 700 \u00b0C for 3 h, which demonstrated the effects of calcination temperature on the TiO 2 crystal phase. It could be found that at 350 and 400 \u00b0C the crystal phase of titania remained anatase. The result was similar to that observed by Zhang et al. [8] The crystal phase transition from anatase to rutile began to appear at 500 \u00b0C. This was in good agreement with the results of TG-DTA. The anatase\u2013rutile transformation rate ( f ), the crystal phase and the average crystallite size of TiO 2 calcined at different temperature were summarized in Table 1 . The anatase\u2013rutile transformation rate ( f ) was determined by using the following equation f = 1 1 + 0.8 \u00d7 I A ( 1 0 1 ) I R ( 1 1 0 ) \u00d7 100 % , where I A (1 0 1) is the integral intensity corresponding to the (1 0 1) crystal face peak of anatase and I R (1 1 0) is the integral intensity corresponding to the (1 1 0) crystal face peak of rutile. The average crystallite sizes of the TiO 2 calcined at different temperature were obtained by using Scherrer\u2019s equation. D = K \u03bb / \u03b2 cos \u03b8 , where \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength for measurement; \u03b2 the breadth of diffraction rays due to the crystallite size; \u03b8 the Bragg angle of diffraction rays and K is the constant. 3.2.2 XRD analysis of CuO/TiO 2 The XRD patterns of 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalysts (TiO 2 -support was calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 3 h) calcined at different temperatures were shown in Fig. 3 . For 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalyst calcined at 200 \u00b0C, the CuO peak was very weak. Bandara et al. [9] reported that it was due to the presence of noticeable amorphous CuO. For the CuO/TiO 2 catalyst calcined at 300 \u00b0C, the CuO diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 = 35.5\u00b0 and 38.6\u00b0 could be observed clearly. As the calcination temperature increased, the CuO crystalline peaks became sharper and sharper, indicating the particle size of CuO became larger and larger. The calculated average CuO crystallite size by using Scherrer\u2019s equation was listed in Table 2 . 3.3 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy The Cu2p and Ti2p XP spectra of CuO/TiO 2 catalysts with different CuO loading were shown in Fig. 4 . The peaks of Cu (2p3/2) and Cu (2p1/2) were centered at 935.6 and 955.6 eV, respectively. The Cu (2p3/2) and Cu (2p1/2) binding energy of the samples was slightly higher than the data of pure CuO reported by Chang et al. [10] , but it is in agreement with the results of Brian et al. [11] . According to several previous studies of the catalysts based on copper oxide, the higher binding energy was possibly caused by the interaction between TiO 2 -support and active component, resulting in the shift of the Cu binding energy [10\u201312] . The XPS peak intensity ratios of I Cu2p / I Ti2p as a function of CuO loading ( Fig. 5 ) were determined to identify the monolayer dispersion threshold of CuO in CuO/TiO 2 catalysts. According to Yu et al. [13] , the resulting curve can be thought of as being made up of two lines with different slopes. The point of intersection of the two lines can be regarded as the maximum dispersion capacity, i.e. the monolayer dispersion threshold. So it could be concluded that the monolayer dispersion threshold of the CuO/TiO 2 system calcined at 400 \u00b0C is about 7.3 wt% CuO loading. The CuO crystalline began to appear when the CuO loading was above 7.3 wt%, and the surface of TiO 2 was occupied by the dispersed CuO to the maximum extent. 3.4 Activity measurements Fig. 5 shows the CO conversion over the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts (TiO 2 -support was calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 3 h) with different CuO loading (2\u201312 wt%). For all the CuO/TiO 2 samples, the activity for CO oxidation increased with the increase of the reaction temperature. It was found that the effect of the CuO loading on the CO oxidation activity of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts had the following order: 8 wt% > 12 wt% \u2248 10 wt% > 6 wt% \u2248 4 wt% > 2 wt%. This results indicated that increasing the CuO loading could promote the catalytic activities of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts to some extent, but it was not always so. Among all these catalysts, the 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity and obtained complete CO conversion at 110 \u00b0C. The result agreed with the XPS measurements very well. Yu et al. [13] reported that the best catalytic effect was achieved when the amount of CuO was near the monolayer dispersion threshold, higher amount of CuO loading would have reverse effect. The similar results were reported by Friedman and Freeman [12] who pointed out that beyond a critical quantity, any additional copper loading was in the form of bulk crystalline oxide. Liu and Flytzani-stephanopoulos [14] suggested that the activity of catalyst derived primarily from the combination of finely dispersed copper-support systems, and bulk copper oxide had negligible contributions. Therefore, when the CuO loading was more than the monolayer dispersion threshold, the number of the effective active phase species was reduced with the increase of crystalline CuO, resulting in a suppression of catalytic activity. Fig. 6 gives the CO oxidation activities on 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalysts (TiO 2 -support was calcined at 350 \u00b0C for 3 h) calcined at different temperature. It was found that the increase in calcination temperature of the catalysts resulted in a fluctuation of the CO oxidation activities. The CO oxidation activities of the catalysts increased by increasing the calcination temperature from 200 to 300 \u00b0C. When the catalyst was calcined at 300 \u00b0C, the highest catalytic activity was observed, and the activity began to decrease as the calcination temperature reached to 400 \u00b0C. When the calcination temperature of the catalyst reached 500 \u00b0C, the CO oxidation activities decreased considerably, no complete CO conversation was detected in the reaction temperature range of 20\u2013200 \u00b0C. From the XRD study, it could be found that the amorphous CuO in CuO/TiO 2 catalyst was noticeable when it was calcined at 200 \u00b0C. After calcined at 300 \u00b0C, the CuO diffraction peaks could be observed clearly, and the degree of crystallinity of CuO also increased with the increase of the sintering temperature This indicated that the catalytic performances of catalysts strongly dependent on the crystal phase of CuO. This is in good agreement with the report of Haller et al. [15] . According to the XRD results, as the calcination temperature raised from 300 to 500 \u00b0C, the crystal size of CuO increased considerably. This suggested that the decrease of catalytic activity was caused by the increase of CuO crystal size. Fig. 7 displays the effect of the calcination temperature of TiO 2 -support on the catalytic activities of 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalyst calcined at 400 \u00b0C for CO oxidation. The reaction temperature for 100% CO conversion was 110 and 140 \u00b0C when the TiO 2 -support was calcined at 400 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively. The catalyst with TiO 2 -support calcined at 700 \u00b0C only had 87.28% CO conversion at reaction temperature of 170 \u00b0C. This indicated that the calcination temperature of TiO 2 -support had an evidently influence on the catalytic activity of CuO/TiO 2 catalyst. The XRD results ( Fig. 3 .) showes when TiO 2 was calcined at 400 \u00b0C the titania phase completely remained anatase. However, when calcined at 500 \u00b0C the rutile phase began to appear, and the fraction of rutile phase increased with the increase of the calcination temperature of TiO 2 -support. At the same time, with the increase of calcination temperature of TiO 2 -support, the particle size of TiO 2 increased. Several previous studies [16,17] of the catalysts based on titania showed that some properties of titania might strongly depended on its polymorphic phase and particle size. Based on the above analyses, the result that the catalysts with the TiO 2 -support calcined at 400 \u00b0C showed the highest catalytic activities might be attributed to the complete anatase phase of TiO 2 -support and the smaller particle size of CuO (see Fig. 8 ). In order to test the lifetime of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts prepared by the DP method, we carried out an investigation on the 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalyst (TiO 2 was calcined at 400 \u00b0C and the catalyst was calcined at 300 \u00b0C). Fig. 9 depicts the variation of the catalytic activity of the catalyst for CO oxidation as a function of reaction time. For the test, the reaction temperature was kept at 383 K. The deactivation rate for 8 wt% CuO/TiO 2 catalyst was very low, and changed very slightly during the period of reaction until the reaction was stopped (16 h). The above result of the test demonstrated that the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts were stable. 4 Conclusion The CuO/TiO 2 catalyst was proved to be an active and stable catalyst for CO oxidation. The TiO 2 particles acted as the support and the CuO acted as the active component. The catalytic activity of the catalysts depended on some elements as follows: (1) Calcination temperature of the TiO 2 -support. The catalytic activities strongly depended on the TiO 2 -support calcination temperature. In other words, the catalytic activity was affected by the crystal phase and particle size of the TiO 2 -support. CuO supported on the TiO 2 support calcined at 400 \u00b0C showed the best catalytic activity in this study. (2) The CuO loading. The activity of CuO/TiO 2 catalysts with 8 wt% CuO loading was much higher than that of the catalysts with other CuO loadings. This might be due to the fact that 8 wt% CuO loading was near the monolayer dispersion threshold (7.3 wt%) of CuO on TiO 2 . (3) Calcination temperature of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts. The increase in CO oxidation activity of the CuO/TiO 2 catalysts with increasing calcination temperature from 200 to 300 \u00b0C could be attributed to the fact that the CuO was fully crystallized, however, the decrease in catalytic activities with increasing calcination temperature from 300 to 500 \u00b0C could be attributed to the increase of the CuO crystalline size.

The products are characterized with transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. Their photocatalytic performance is evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation rates of methyl orange in aqueous solution under UV-vis light irradiation. The results reveal that the treated nanotubes are more thermally stable and exhibit better photocatalytic performance than primary nanotubes. The treated nanotubes can keep a tubular structure when calcined at 400\u00b0C. However, their precursors collapse when they are calcined only at 300\u00b0C.

        "abstract": "Polypyrrole (PPy) was prepared by chemical oxidation polymerization, analyzed by FT-IR, elemental analysis and HRTEM, and studied for gas sensitivity. It suggested that PPy had sensitivity to NH 3 , H 2 S and NO x , and showed irreversibility to NO x gas. The organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials PPy/ZnO with different PPy weight percents were prepared by mechanical mixing, and the sensitivity study of the materials to toxic gases NH 3 , H 2 S, NO x was carried out at different operating temperatures 30, 60, and 90 \u00b0C. It was found that PPy/ZnO materials (PPy(1%)/ZnO, PPy(3%)/ZnO, PPy(5%)/ZnO, PPy(10%)/ZnO, PPy(20%)/ZnO) had better selectivity and reversibility to NO x than pure PPy, and much lower working temperature than the reported working temperature of ZnO (about 350\u2013450 \u00b0C). Their sensitivity increased with the increasing concentration of NO x at particular working temperature, and among them PPy(10%)/ZnO had the maximum sensitivity to NO x in the same condition. They showed no response to 1000, 1500, 2000 ppm NH 3 or H 2 S. The response mechanism of PPy/ZnO materials to NO x was discussed. Keywords Preparation Gas sensitivity Polypyrrole Zinc oxide 1 Introduction With the development of the society, the demand of mankind to living environment becomes higher and higher. The detection of polluted gases, especially toxic gas has become increasingly important. The sensing materials including inorganic or organic have been studied widely [1\u201314] . But both of them have particular advantages and drawbacks. The significant disadvantages of inorganic semiconductors such as SnO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , ZnO are their high operating temperature (350\u2013450 \u00b0C) [15,16] , which increases power consumption and reduces sensor life. Several organic semiconductors, such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophere, polyacetylene, etc., have gas sensitivity at normal temperature [7\u201314] . Polypyrrole is the most studied among these, but its limitations reduce the application largely. The defects such as, PPy is sensitivity to electrochemical and chemical degradation, its conductivity exhibits a long-term irreversible decay due to the irreversible attack of oxygen present in the ambient, and its long response time when it is monitored gases due to the highly ordered structure [17] . In addition, the low selectivity is the most serious problem of organic and inorganic sensing materials. To prepare the optimized properties of materials, organic\u2013inorganic sensing materials have been developed [18\u201320] , considering which can complement the characteristics of pure inorganic and organic materials. Recently, the studies of organic\u2013inorganic materials for sensors are: Komila Suri [21] studied the pressure and humidity sensitivity of polypyrrole/iron oxide; Sara Nardis [22] reported that cobalt porphyrin/tin dioxide had superior selectivity to methanol vapor than to CO; Hosono and Matsubara [23,24] synthesized PPy/MoO 3 thin film and PPy/MoO 3 pressed pellet and studied for the gas sensitivity to volatile organic compounds like formaldehyde, ethanol, toluene, benzene and so on. And these types of hybrid materials have been shown to possess small grain size and high stability in air [25,26] . But the research of this kind of materials to toxic gases is few. In this paper, we prepared PPy by chemical oxidation polymerization. Anhydrous FeCl 3 was used as oxidant. The product was analyzed by FT-IR, elemental analysis and HRTEM. PPy/ZnO materials were prepared by mechanical mixing, and studied for gas sensitivity to toxic gases NH 3 , H 2 S, NO x at low temperature. To the best of our knowledge it is the first time to study the gas sensitivity of PPy/ZnO materials. 2 Experimental 2.1 The preparation and characterizations of polypyrrole (PPy) Pyrrole (Py) monomer was distilled under reduced pressure, put in a desiccator and stored in the refrigerator to use. Polypyrrole (PPy) was prepared by chemical oxidation in nitrogen atmosphere. Ethyl ether was used as solvent, and anhydrous FeCl 3 as oxidant. The reaction equation was as follows: Ethyl ether was added to a specific amount of anhydrous FeCl 3 contained in a 100 ml round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar, and then few drops of distilled pyrrole were added to the stirred solution. After a reaction time of 1.5 h, the mixture was filtered and the black precipitate was obtained. The product was washed by water to pH 6, followed by ethanol, and dried in vacuum. PPy was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Avatar 380 FT-IR spectrophotometer), elemental analysis (Elementar Vario EL., German), and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (Philips T20ST). 2.2 The preparation of PPy/ZnO A series of PPy/ZnO hybrid materials recorded as PPy(1%)/ZnO, PPy(3%)/ZnO, PPy(5%)/ZnO, PPy(10%)/ZnO, PPy(20%)/ZnO, PPy(30%)/ZnO, PPy(40%)/ZnO according to different PPy mass percent were prepared by mechanical mixing using PPy and ZnO (purchased from Damao, Tianjin, the particle size was about 30 nm). 2.3 Gas sensitivity detection of PPy and PPy/ZnO materials In gas sensitivity detection, NO x (mostly NO, little NO 2 and N 2 O 4 ), H 2 S and NH 3 were selected. The sensing materials were fabricated on an aluminum tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. A Ni\u2013Cr alloy through the tube was used as heating filament. The sensor's voltage was measured indirectly by an external resistor in the testing circuit. The volume of the testing house was 15 L, and a fan within it was used to make a homogeneous test gas atmosphere. The gas sensitivity S was defined as S = V g / V a , where V a was the initial voltage of the sensor in clear air and V g the voltage of the sensor when it was exposed to testing gases. All experiments were carried out in a fixing humidity of 60%. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 The characterizations of PPy The FT-IR transmission spectra of PPy using KBr pellet was recorded in the range of 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 ( Fig. 1 ). The specific bands are observed at 3400, 1540, 1460, 1298, 1180, 1036, 900 and 780 cm \u22121 . They are close to those reported data [27,28] : stretching vibration (1540 cm \u22121 ) of C C bond, stretching vibration (1298 cm \u22121 ) of C\u2013C bond, stretching vibration (3400 cm \u22121 ) of N\u2013H bond, and bonds (1460, 1180, 1036, 900, 780 cm \u22121 ) of pyrrole ring. The result of elemental analysis is C: 48.35%, H: 3.63%, N: 12.94%, Cl: 14.14%, (C 4.03 H 3.63 N 0.92 Cl 0.4 ), Cl \u2212 is the doping anion in PPy. Picture 1 ((a) and (b)) is the HRTEM micrograph of PPy. From Picture (a) we can see PPy shows linear structure, which indicates that Py monomer polymerizes through \u03b1\u2013\u03b1 bond as reported. Some PPy shows the ring structure (Picture (b)), which due to the connection of head and tail of linear PPy. 3.2 The gas sensitivity detection Intrinsic PPy has no gas sensitivity, but the doped PPy has gas sensitivity and its properties depending on the dopant anion [13,14,17] . In addition, higher operating temperature (such as 90 \u00b0C) is disbennifit to the gas sensitivity of PPy, it maybe can damage the linear structure of PPy and hinder the migration of vacancy in PPy [29] . In this experiment, FeCl 3 was used as oxidant and Cl \u2212 as the doping anion in PPy at the same time. PPy exhibits gas sensitivity to NH 3 , H 2 S and NO x at room temperature, which was consistent with the report [11] . But PPy exhibits irreversibility to NO x among the three gases. This maybe that NO x can block the gas/PPy interaction sites of PPy [17] . Fig. 2 is the response curve of PPy to 2000 ppm NO x . The sensitivity ( S = V g / V a ) is about 1.50. The gas sensitivity testing of PPy/ZnO materials to NH 3 , H 2 S and NO x were monitored at 30, 60 and 90 \u00b0C, respectively. It was found that PPy/ZnO materials (PPy(1%)/ZnO, PPy(3%)/ZnO, PPy(5%)/ZnO, PPy(10%)/ZnO, PPy(20%)/ZnO) had gas sensitivity to NO x , but no gas sensitivity to 1000, 1500, 2000 ppm NH 3 or H 2 S. PPy(30%)/ZnO and PPy(40%)/ZnO had no response to the three kinds of gases in our testing conditions. It suggested that PPy/ZnO materials had better selectivity to NO x than PPy. Figs. 3\u20135 show the relationship of PPy/ZnO materials\u2019 NO x sensitivity with PPy mass percent at different operating temperature. We can see that these three figures have similar change tendency. The sensitivity of PPy/ZnO materials increase with the increasing gas concentration at specific temperature, and PPy(10%)/ZnO has the maximum sensitivity to the testing gas at the same volume concentration and temperature. As an example, the response curve of PPy(3%)/ZnO to 2000 ppm NO x at different temperature is showed in Fig. 6 . The sensitivity of PPy(3%)/ZnO at 30, 60 and 90 \u00b0C is 68.71, 42.10, 33.31, respectively, which is higher than that of PPy. The response time of PPy(3%)/ZnO to NO x is within few minutes, but the recovery time is about 24 h. It suggests that PPy(3%)/ZnO has better reversibility than pure PPy in some degree though the recovery time of composite is not very short. The resistance of PPy(3%)/ZnO decreases when exposed to NO x gas, that is, PPy(3%)/ZnO material shows the properties of n-type semiconductor when exposed to reducing gas. It can be explained that PPy is a p-type semiconductor and ZnO an n-type semiconductor, so there are two competitive mechanisms within PPy/ZnO materials. Due to ZnO at high level in composites, ZnO has the decisive effect in this process when exposed to the electron donating gas NO x . But the true response mechanism of PPy/ZnO materials to NO x is under research. Figs. 7\u20139 show the sensitivity of PPy/ZnO materials to 1000, 1500, 2000 ppm NO x at different temperatures, respectively. From Fig. 7 , we can see that the sensitivity of PPy/ZnO materials to 1000 ppm NO x is the maximum at 90 \u00b0C. In Fig. 8 , all PPy/ZnO materials to 1500 ppm NO x also have the maximum sensitivity at 90 \u00b0C excepting that PPy(10%)/ZnO exhibits the maximum sensitivity at 30 \u00b0C. The sensitivity tendency of PPy/ZnO materials to 2000 ppm NO x at different temperature ( Fig. 9 ) is not similar as Fig. 7 or 8 , which maybe that PPy/ZnO materials showed smaller signal change during further gas measurement after several times exposure to NO x . How to ameliorate this problem is our next work. 4 Conclusions The gas sensitivity study of organic\u2013inorganic materials is in the beginning at present. To explore new sensing materials, and explain the response mechanism and supplement the deficiencies of the present sensing materials are all the emphases in the future. In this paper, we prepared PPy and PPy/ZnO materials and studied their gas sensitivity. It is the first time to report the gas sensitivity of PPy/ZnO materials to toxic gases NH 3 , H 2 S, and NO x at low temperatures 30, 60, and 90 \u00b0C. We found that PPy/ZnO materials had superior properties than PPy and ZnO: (1) PPy/ZnO materials had better selectivity and reversibility to NO x than PPy, (2) the working temperature of PPy/ZnO materials is much lower than the reported working temperature of ZnO about 350\u2013450 \u00b0C, (3) PPy(10%)/ZnO had the maximum sensitivity to NO x in the same condition, and (4) PPy(3%)/ZnO had higher sensitivity than PPy.

        "title": "ZnO hollow spheres: Preparation, characterization, and gas sensing properties",
        "abstract": "ZnO hollow spheres were successfully prepared by using carbon microspheres as templates and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). A gas sensor was fabricated from the as-prepared ZnO hollow spheres and tested to different concentrations of NH 3 and NO 2 at different operating temperatures. The results showed that the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor exhibited extremely different sensing behaviors to NH 3 and NO 2 . The optimum operating temperature of the sensor was 220 \u00b0C for NH 3 and 240 \u00b0C for NO 2 , respectively. At 220 \u00b0C, the responses to 25, 50 and 75 ppm NH 3 were 7.9, 11.1 and 20.4 and the response times were as long as several minutes. At 240 \u00b0C, the responses to 10, 50 and 100 ppm NO 2 were 140.6, 172.8 and 286.8 and the corresponding response times were 31, 19 and 9 s. In addition, it is also shown that the gas sensor exhibited much higher response to NO 2 than to other gases at 240 \u00b0C, implying the good selectivity and potential application of the sensor for detecting NO 2 . Keywords ZnO Hollow sphere Sensor Response Selectivity 1 Introduction As a functional semiconductor, ZnO has been extensively studied in various applications, including field-effect transistor [1] , optical device [2] , dye-sensitized solar cell [3] , solid-state gas sensor [4] and so forth. Recent studies [5,6] have comprehensively reviewed the functional devices based on ZnO material. It has been demonstrated that both the size and shape or morphology have an influence on the properties of materials [7,8] . Therefore, numerous efforts have been paid to the synthesis of nanostructured ZnO such as nanoparticles [4] , nanowires [9] , nanobelts [10,11] , nanorods [12,13] , nanotubes [14,15] and hollow spheres [16,17] for various applications. One of the most important applications of nanostructured ZnO material is solid-state gas senor. In a previous work, Ghimbeu et al. reported that ZnO films showed higher sensitivity to NO 2 than to H 2 S at 300 \u00b0C [18] . Most of the studies [4,18\u201323] have examined the gas sensing properties of ZnO sensors fabricated from the above-mentioned nanostructures other than hollow spheres. Inorganic hollow spheres have found a variety of potential applications due to their unique structure [24\u201326] . For instance, in the area of gas sensor, many studies have proved that sensing materials with either hollow-sphere structure or porous structure could largely enhance the sensor properties [27\u201329] . However, to our best knowledge, no research has been reported on using ZnO hollow spheres for gas sensor applications. In this work, we mainly report on the preparation, characterization and sensing properties of ZnO hollow spheres templated by carbon microspheres. The temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent sensing behaviors of the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor to NH 3 and NO 2 are studied. Other gases were also tested to depict the selectivity of the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor. Obtained results show that the gas sensor exhibited much higher response to NO 2 than to other gases at 240 \u00b0C, implying the preferential selectivity of the sensor to NO 2 . 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Chemical reagents (from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute) such as Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b72H 2 O), dimethylformamide (DMF), glucose and absolute ethanol were all of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Distilled water was used throughout the experiment. 2.2 Preparation of carbon microspheres Carbon microspheres were prepared according to a reported procedure [29,30] . A clear solution containing 7.2 g of glucose and 80 mL of water was placed in a 100 mL of teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 \u00b0C for 4 h. The puce products were collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 80 \u00b0C in an oven overnight. 2.3 Preparation of ZnO hollow spheres In a typical synthesis, 0.33 g of Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b72H 2 O was dissolved in 15 mL of DMF under stirring, 0.2 g of carbon microspheres were uniformly dispersed in 25 mL of DMF by ultrasonication, then the Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 solution was added into the 25 mL of DMF at a speed of 20 s per drop. After ultrasonicating for 1 h, 2 mL of water was added into the solution, then the mixed solution was aged under ambient conditions for one day. The puce precursor was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 40 \u00b0C in vacuum for 6 h. ZnO hollow spheres with a white color were finally obtained after the puce precursor was calcined at 450 \u00b0C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. 2.4 Sensor fabrication and measurements A proper amount of ZnO hollow spheres were slightly grinded together with several drops of water in an agate mortar. The formed slurry was coated (40\u201350 \u03bcm in thickness) onto an alumina tube with a diameter of 1 mm and length of 4 mm, being positioned with a pair of Au electrodes and four Pt wires on both ends of the tube. A Ni\u2013Cr alloy coil through the tube was employed as a heater to control the operating temperature by tuning the heating voltage. Gas sensing tests were performed by a HW-30A gas sensing measurement system (HanWei Electronics Co., Ltd., Henan Province, China) at a relative humidity (RH) of 25\u201338%. HW-30A is a static system using atmospheric air as the interference gas. Test gases with calculated amount are introduced into the test chamber by a syringe. Two electric fans installed in the chamber are used to make test gas homogeneous. After test, the chamber was removed for test gases to diffuse away. The scheme and working principle of HW-30A gas sensing measurement system are shown in Fig. 1 . The sensor response to NO 2 (oxidative gas) and NH 3 (reductive gas) is defined as R g / R a and R a / R g , where R g is the sensor resistance in a target gas and R a is the sensor resistance in air, respectively. 2.5 Characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5) in a 2 \u03b8 range of 20\u201380\u00b0. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken on a Shimadzu SS-550, 15 kV. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were abtained by a Philips FEI Tecnai 20ST transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) specific surface area was tested by using a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. 3 Results and discussion The typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared ZnO hollow spheres is shown in Fig. 2 . All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO, with lattice constants a = 3.249 \u00c5 and c = 5.207 \u00c5 (JCPDS card 36-1451). No other diffraction peaks can be observed in the pattern, implying that the carbon microsphere templates were completely removed. The carbon microspheres have an average diameter of 400\u2013500 nm estimated from the SEM image shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 4 a and b show the SEM images of the as-prepared ZnO hollow spheres with a diameter of 200\u2013400 nm, which is smaller than that of carbon microspheres. This implies that a large shrinkage has happened in the annealing process for removing the carbon templates and a similar result have been reported by Sun et al. [29] . Some small openings (marked by white squares) in the spheres can be seen clearly, implying the hollow structure of the spheres. Detailed information of the ZnO hollow spheres can be obtained from the TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. From Fig. 5 a and b , it can be seen that most of the ZnO hollow spheres have a diameter in the range of 200\u2013360 nm, in accordance with the SEM observations. The contrast difference between the brighter central part and the darker marginal part implies the hollow structure of ZnO spheres. It can also be seen that the shells of these hollow spheres are coarse with a thickness of about 25 nm. A detailed observation from Fig. 5 c shows that the shells consist of numerous nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 20 to 30 nm. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 5 d confirms the polycrystalline structure of these hollow spheres. The BET surface area of the as-prepared ZnO hollow spheres was measured to be ca. 37 m 2 /g. Fig. 6 shows the photograph of the gas sensor. The gas sensor fabricated from the prepared ZnO hollow spheres was tested to three different concentrations of NH 3 (25, 50 and 75 ppm) and three different concentrations of NO 2 (10, 50 and 100 ppm). The operating temperatures were set as 180, 200, 220 and 240 \u00b0C for NH 3 and 220, 240, 260 and 280 \u00b0C for NO 2 , respectively. The response and recovery time is defined as the time for the sensor to reach 90% of its total change in voltage. The response curves of the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor to different concentrations of NH 3 at different operating temperatures are shown in Fig. 7 . It is clear that at each operating temperature, the response of the sensor becomes larger as the concentration of NH 3 increases. On the other hand, the response amplitude enlarges from 180 to 220 \u00b0C and shrinks at 240 \u00b0C. However, the response and recovery times are not satisfactory with values up to several minutes to all NH 3 concentrations. It seems that the sensor shows the largest responses to all NH 3 concentrations when operated at 220 \u00b0C. This is also confirmed by the curves of response versus operating temperature, shown in Fig. 8 . The curves in Fig. 8 also show that the response increases with increasing NH 3 concentration at each operating temperature. The sensing performances of the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor to different concentrations of NO 2 at various operating temperatures are shown in Fig. 9 . Compared with the curves in Fig. 7 , the most distinct characteristics of the curves in Fig. 9 are the downward trend and the fast response. On one hand, the curves ascend or descend sharply with NO 2 gas in or out. On the other hand, by comparison in Fig. 9 , it can be clearly seen that the recovery times are shortened as the operating temperature increases. Taking the curves at 240 \u00b0C for example, the response times to 10, 50 and 100 ppm NO 2 are 31, 19 and 9 s, respectively. However, the recovery times are about several minutes which are much longer than the response times. The NO 2 response versus temperature curves are shown in Fig. 10 , showing that the responses to 10, 50 and 100 ppm NO 2 reach the maximums at 240 \u00b0C, with the values of 140.6, 172.8 and 286.8, respectively. It has been reported that the ZnO nanopowder-based sensor [31] showed a maximum response of 11.0 and a response time of about 130 s at 300 \u00b0C to 25 ppm NO 2 , while our ZnO hollow-sphere sensor has a maximum response of 140.6 and a response time of 31 s at 240 \u00b0C to 10 ppm NO 2 . By comparison, it is obvious that the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor in this work exhibited more excellent performances with respect to response, response time and lower optimum operating temperature. The improved sensing properties can be related to the enhanced active surface area and easier gas diffusion induced by the hollow structure of the sensor material [28] . The sensor based on ZnO hollow spheres has a loose and porous structure compared with tightly contacted ZnO nanopowders. Thus, the target gas molecules could diffuse to both the outer and inner surfaces of the ZnO hollow spheres, leading to an improved sensitivity and a shortened response time. To further depict the sensing ability of the hollow-sphere sensor, we have also fabricated a sensor based on commercial ZnO powder and tested its NO 2 sensing performance ( Fig. 11 ) for comparison. It can be seen that the response amplitudes of the commercial powder sensor are smaller than those of the hollow-sphere sensor ( Fig. 9 ). In addition, the NO 2 responses of the powder sensor (Inset of Fig. 9 ) are nearly neglectable compared with those of hollow-sphere sensor ( Fig. 10 ). It is well known that ZnO is an n-type semiconductor and its sensing mechanism is dominated by the surface process when the operating temperature is below 400 \u00b0C [32] . As a matter of fact, due to progress achieved in recent years, the sensing mechanism of gas sensors is pervasive, but still controversial and not fully understood [33] . A popular and well accepted sensing mechanism for n-type semiconductor oxides mainly involves two aspects: the formation of electron depletion layer by oxygen species on the surface of sensor material and surface reactions between target gas molecules and oxygen species that lead to a change in sensor resistance. Adsorbed oxygen species ( O 2 \u2212 , O \u2212 and O 2\u2212 ) are formed by surface adsorbed oxygen trapping electrons from the conduction band, resulting in the formation of electron depletion layer on the surface of gas sensors [33,34] . The resistance of the sensor can be modulated by oxidative or reductive interactions between oxygen species and target gases. NO 2 is an oxidative gas, it would accept electrons through the surface reactions, increasing the width of surface charge layers [35] . Thus, the sensor resistance is increased. In contrary to NO 2 , the sensor resistance is decreased in the case of reductive NH 3 . As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 9 , the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor behaves contrarily to NH 3 and to NO 2 , showing that the response-recovery curves are raised to NH 3 and sunk to NO 2 . In addition, in our tests, it was found that the resistance of ZnO hollow-sphere sensor decreased upon increasing operating temperature ( Fig. 12 ). In other words, the sensor resistance or conductance was very dependent on the operating temperature. A similar phenomenon was also reported in some other studies [18,36\u201338] . Lee and Reedy [39] have summarized the factors that are responsible for the temperature dependence of the sensor conductance (or resistance). One important factor is the differing stabilities of oxygen species at different temperatures. Arnold et al. have demonstrated that the number of surface oxygen species is a function of temperature [38] . Another issue we would like to emphasize on is the selectivity of the prepared ZnO hollow-sphere sensor. It has been depicted that gas sensors based on semiconductor metal oxides often response to several gas species simultaneously [40] , which is highly unfavorable for practical applications. Much effort has been focused on improving the selectivity of gas sensors. A very common method arised in recent years is to fabricate doped sensor material by introducing dopants, including noble metals, metal oxides and different conduction type oxides (n or p-type) into semiconductor oxides [41\u201345] . This method mainly makes use of the catalytic effect of noble metals or the p\u2013n heterojunction formed by the contacts of two different metal oxides. An alternative method is the temperature modulation technique [39,46,47] , which is based on the temperature-dependence of the sensor resistance or the different optimum operating temperatures of the sensor for different gases. Compared with the former method, the temperature modulation technique is believed to be superior with regard to low fabrication cost, easy preparation and simple sensing mechanism. As is known to all, introducing noble metals as dopants into semiconductors not only increases the fabrication cost and complexity of fabrication process but also makes it more difficult for one to access a clear sensing mechanism. Thus it is highly appealing if a gas sensor shows a good selectivity to a particular gas without any special treatments. Considering that NO 2 gas is very oxidative and unstable, it can easily adsorb onto sensor material and cause surface reactions therein. This means that the NO 2 gas has more \u201copportunities\u201d to be detected by a gas sensor. Furthermore, the sensor selectivity to a particular gas is to some extent dependent on the chemical nature of gases, i.e., the ability to draw electrons for oxidative gas or release electrons for reductive gas in reaction with sensor material. Fig. 13 shows the responses of the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor to various gases at 240 \u00b0C. Obviously, the sensor exhibits a maximum response to NO 2 with a value up to 286.8, while for all other gases, the responses do not exceed 50. Thus it can be concluded that the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor has a good selectivity to NO 2 against other gases and maybe useful in exploring NO 2 gas sensors. 4 Conclusion In summary, ZnO hollow spheres mediated by carbon microspheres were synthesized and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and SAED. The prepared ZnO hollow spheres had a diameter of 200\u2013400 nm and a shell thickness of about 25 nm. A gas sensor was fabricated from the as-prepared ZnO hollow spheres and tested to NH 3 , NO 2 and other gases. Obtained results showed that the ZnO hollow-sphere sensor exhibited very different behaviors to NH 3 and NO 2 . The optimum operating temperature for NH 3 is 220 \u00b0C, which is lower than that (240 \u00b0C) for NO 2 . At 220 \u00b0C, the sensor showed the maximum response to all tested concentrations of NH 3 , but the response and recovery times were as long as several minutes. Notably, the sensor showed very excellent sensing performances to NO 2 in the temperature range of 240\u2013280 \u00b0C. At 240 \u00b0C, the responses to10, 50 and 100 ppm NO 2 were 140.6, 172.8 and 286.8, while the response times were 31, 19 and 9 s, respectively. Furthermore, it is also shown that the gas sensor possessed an excellent selectivity to NO 2 against other gases at 240 \u00b0C, implying the potential of the sensor for detecting NO 2 . However, further effort is in great need and in progress for developing a gas sensor with an exclusive selectivity for NO 2.

The gas sensitivity measurements indicated that both the undoped (operated at 240 \u00b0C) and the 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2O 3 sensors (operated at 270 \u00b0C) exhibited high response to acetone and ethanol, moderate response to petrol, poor response to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), H 2 and CO.

Keywords Au/SnO 2 catalysts Deposition\u2013precipitation method Low-temperature CO oxidation 1 Introduction Compared with inert bulk gold, supported gold catalysts show a surprising high catalytic in many reactions, such as the reduction of nitrogen oxides [1,2] , the epoxidation of propene [3,4] , complete oxidation of hydrocarbons, hydrogenation, water\u2013gas shift reaction [5\u201312] and the low-temperature oxidation of CO [13\u201317] . Since Haruta's report [18] of the remarkably high activity of supported gold catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation, interest in the potential applications of supported gold catalysts has increased dramatically, along with research efforts to understand the origin of this surprising activity. Haruta et al. [15\u201317] discovered when gold was highly dispersed on semiconductor metal oxides such as TiO 2 , \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 and Co 3 O 4 , it turns out to be highly active for the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of CO. Although the catalytic activity of gold catalysts in the low-temperature CO oxidation has been intensively studied during the last decade, the catalytic activity of gold supported on SnO 2 has seldom been discussed. Due to the particular physical and chemical properties of nanosized tin dioxide, SnO 2 has covered a wide range of applications such as catalyst, catalytic support, gas sensor, rechargeable Li battery and optical electronic device [19\u201321] . In previous work, we had synthesized Au/SnO 2 catalysts by a co-precipitation process, and their catalytic activity for CO oxidation was also investigated [22] . But the catalytic activity was not very satisfactory. There has already been a general consensus that the preparation method, the synthesis parameters, pretreatment conditions and the choice of the support all exert a significant influence on the ultimate catalytic performance. To improve the catalytic activity of Au/SnO 2 catalysts, in this work, various Au/SnO 2 catalysts were prepared by a deposition\u2013precipitation method, and the influence of the calcination temperature of SnO 2 support, calcination temperature of Au/SnO 2 catalysts and Au loading on catalytic activity was investigated. Several techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were employed to study the structure and the CO oxidation property of Au/SnO 2 catalysts. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation SnO 2 support was synthesized by a precipitation process using SnCl 4 \u00b75H 2 O and NH 4 OH. Under vigorous stirring, 1 mol/L NH 4 OH aqueous solution was added drop-wise to a 0.25 mol/L SnCl 4 solution until the pH of the solution was 7. The suspension formed was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol alternatively until Cl \u2212 could not be examined by 0.1 mol/L AgNO 3 aqueous solution, and then the sample was dried overnight in air at 353 K. The as-prepared material was ground and calcined in air at 473, 573, 673 and 773 K for 3 h, respectively. Au/SnO 2 catalysts were prepared by a deposition\u2013precipitation method. Under vigorous stirring, SnO 2 support was dispersed in HAuCl 4 solution. Over a period of 1 h, 1 mol/L NH 4 OH aqueous solution was added drop-wise to the above resulting slurry under vigorous stirring until the pH of the slurry was 10. The mixture was stirred for another hour, then filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol alternately. The samples were dried at room temperature for 2 h in air, followed by calcination at different temperatures in air for 3 h. 2.2 Measurement of catalytic activity Catalytic activity tests were performed in a continuous-flow fixed-bed microreactor, using 100 mg catalyst powder. A stainless steel tube with an inner diameter of 8 mm was chosen as the reactor tube. The reaction gas mixture consisting of 1 vol.% CO balanced with air was passed through the catalyst bed at a total flow rate of 33.4 mL/min. A typical weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 20,040 mL h \u22121 g \u22121 . After 30 min under reaction conditions, the effluent gases were analyzed online by GC-508A gas chromatography. The activity was expressed by the degree of CO conversion. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on D/MAX-RAX diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 100 mA, using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (scanning range 2 \u03b8 : 20\u201375\u00b0). Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy was carried out on a Philips-T20ST electron microscope, operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5600 spectrophotometer with the Mg K\u03b1 radiation. The operating conditions were kept constant at 187.85 eV and 250.0 W. In order to subtract the surface charging effect, the C 1s peak has been fixed, in agreement with the literature, at a binding energy of 284.6 eV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Support and catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the as-prepared SnO 2 samples calcined at different temperatures. Compared to JCPDS (File No. 41-1445) standard pattern, the peaks agreed well with tetragonal rutile crystalline structure of SnO 2 crystal, with no additional lines belonging to other phases such as SnO, i.e. observed in any of the X-ray diffraction patterns. This indicated that the increase of calcination temperature did not cause the transformation of lattice structure of SnO 2 . With the increase of calcination temperature, the intensity of diffraction peaks of [1 1 0], [1 0 1] and [2 1 1] crystal faces gradually increased, and diffraction peaks of [2 0 0], [2 2 0], [0 0 2], [3 1 0] and [3 0 1] crystal faces were gradually visible. This showed that crystalline structure of SnO 2 tended towards integrity. From the information provided by XRD patterns, we could see that the characterization diffraction peaks of the samples were apparently broad at low temperature (<673 K), showing that the small-sized nanocrystalline SnO 2 was obtained. At the same time, with the increase of calcination temperature, the characterization diffraction peaks of SnO 2 became more and more sharp, indicating the particle size of SnO 2 increased. The average diameters of particles treated at different temperature were calculated by using Scherrer's equation based on the XRD peak broadening analysis at the (1 1 0) peak and listed in Table 1 . Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Au/SnO 2 catalysts with different Au loading. In the XRD patterns of the samples with Au loading below 2.14 wt.%, no reflection peaks of gold were observed. This was probably due to the small particle size and low content of gold, and therefore its reflection peaks did not allow to be discriminated from the background. When the Au loading reached 2.86 wt.%, the weak Au (2 0 0) diffraction peak at 2 \u03b8 = 44.4\u00b0, related to the presence of metallic gold (JCPDS Card No. 04-0784), could be detected faintly. For the samples with Au loading above 3.21 wt.%, the Au (2 0 0) diffraction peak could be clearly observed. With the increase of Au loading, the Au (2 0 0) characterization diffraction peak became more significant and sharper, indicating the mean particle size of the gold in the Au/SnO 2 catalysts increased. The average size of gold particles calculated from the Au (2 0 0) reflection peak by using the Scherrer's equation was listed in Table 2 . Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the 1.43 wt.% Au/SnO 2 catalysts (SnO 2 support calcined at 673 K for 3 h) calcined at different temperatures. In the XRD pattern of the sample calcined at 473 K almost no reflection peaks of gold were observed. This was probably due to the small particle size of gold, and therefore its reflection peaks did not allow to be discriminated from the background. For the sample calcined at 573 K, the weak Au (2 0 0) diffractions peak at 2 \u03b8 = 44.4\u00b0 could be detected faintly. At higher calcination temperature (673 K), the Au (2 0 0) diffraction peak could be clearly observed. With further increasing calcination temperature, the characterization peaks diffracted from the gold became more significant, indicating the gold particle size increased. The average size of gold particles, calculated from the Au (2 0 0) reflection peak by using the Scherrer's equation, was listed in Table 3 , in which TEM results were also included. HRTEM measurements ( Fig. 4 a ) showed that tin dioxide was highly crystalline after calcination at 673 K. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 4 a) of the SnO 2 support distinctly exhibited four diffraction rings, which corresponded to the (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 1 1) and (1 1 2) planes of the tetragonal-phase SnO 2 with rutile structure, respectively. This was perfectly in agreement with the XRD analytical results, and indicated that the SnO 2 nanoparticles were well crystallized. It was also confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS; Fig. 4 b) that there were not any impurities, indicating that chlorides were completely removed during washing. Fig. 4 c, d, f\u2013h presented the bright-field images of the 1.43 wt.% Au/SnO 2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4 c, the gold nanoparticles were dispersed effectively on the surface of the SnO 2 nanoparticles after calcined at 473 K for 3 h and were not agglomerated. The gold nanoparticles had crystallite sizes between 2 and 4 nm. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum ( Fig. 4 e) confirmed the presence of Au element. It was also confirmed by EDS that there were not any impurities, indicating that chlorides were completely removed after washing. The interplanar spacing of the gold nanoparticle in HRTEM images ( Fig. 4 d) was ca. 0.24 nm, corresponding to the interplanar distance of the (1 1 1) plane of Au nanocrystal. The interference fringe of the (1 1 0) plane of inner SnO 2 nanoparticles was clearly observed in the HRTEM image ( Fig. 4 d), demonstrating a good crystallinity and a high stability of SnO 2 nanoparticles after the decoration of Au nanoparticles. The HRTEM photograph of the samples calcined at 573 K, presented in Fig. 4 f, also showed highly dispersed gold particles, and the small gold particles were also observed. The increase of the particle size of Au with increasing calcination temperature could be observed clearly, which confirmed the XRD results. The larger gold particles (10 nm) in the sample calcined at 673 K were occasionally found in the TEM ( Fig. 4 g). The TEM results in Fig. 4 h showed gold particles in Au/SnO 2 sintered after calcined at 773 K, almost no gold particles with particle size <6 nm existed and the particle size lied between 6 and 20 nm. The mean diameters of Au particles in Au/SnO 2 catalysts were estimated by averaging diameters of more than 100 individual particles and listed in Table 3 . It was clear that during the calcinations above 673 K of the catalysts the sintering of Au clusters would occur. The full-range XPS spectra of the 1.43 wt.% Au/SnO 2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures were shown in Fig. 5 . The XPS spectra revealed that the surface of samples contained gold, tin, oxygen and carbon elements. The absence of chlorine was a good indication of the effectiveness of the washing procedure. For the Au/SnO 2 catalyst with 1.43 wt.% Au loading, the nominal Au/Sn atom ratio was 0.011. However, the surface Au/Sn atom ratio of all samples in XPS was higher than 0.011, and the value of surface Au/Sn atom ratio decreased with the increase of calcination temperature. The Au/Sn atom ratio in XPS is tentatively used to represent the Au dispersion. This indicated that Au particles were well dispersed on the surface of SnO 2 , and that Au particle size increased with the increase of the calcination temperature. The result was agreement with the XRD and TEM data. Fig. 6 compared the XPS spectra in the Au 4f region of the1.43 wt.% Au/SnO 2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures. In all samples, the characteristic doublets of Au 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 peaks were observed. The two peaks for the uncalcined catalyst were at 85.3 and 88.9 eV, respectively, which were similar to those reported on Au 3+ compounds [23] . Increasing calcination temperature, the Au 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 peaks became sharper and shifted to lower binding energy (84.2 and 87.8 eV) indicating an increase of the fraction of Au 0 . For the sample calcined at 473 K, the two peaks were 84.4 and 88.1 eV, which were slightly larger than these of metallic state Au (84.2 and 87.8 eV) but smaller than these of oxidation state Au, indicating a mixture of oxidation state Au and metallic state Au. The samples calcined above 473 K showed that the Au 4f 7/2 peak centered at 84.2 eV and Au 4f 5/2 peak centered at 87.8 eV, which was characteristics of Au in a metallic state [24,25] . 3.2 Catalytic performance Fig. 7 shows the activity of 2.14 wt.% Au catalysts supported on different calcination temperature SnO 2 support with the Au catalysts calcined at 473 K for 3 h. For the Au/SnO 2 catalyst with the SnO 2 support calcined at 873 K, no obvious CO conversion was detected below 413 K reaction temperature. The Au/SnO 2 catalysts with the SnO 2 support calcined at 473 and 773 K were found not to be particularly active in CO oxidation. In fact, no 100% CO conversion was detected in the reaction temperature range of 283\u2013413 K. The highest CO conversion over Au/SnO 2 catalyst with the SnO 2 support calcined at 473 K was lower than Au/SnO 2 catalyst with the SnO 2 support calcined at 773 K. The Au/SnO 2 catalysts with the SnO 2 support calcined at 573 and 673 K clearly exhibited a better performance than other catalysts, and the Au/SnO 2 catalyst with the SnO 2 support calcined at 573 K was more active than the Au/SnO 2 catalyst with the SnO 2 support calcined at 673 K. This indicated that the calcination temperature of SnO 2 support had an evidently influence on catalytic activity of Au/SnO 2 catalysts, and SnO 2 samples calcined at 573 and 673 K were suitable support materials for the Au/SnO 2 catalysts. The XRD results ( Fig. 3 ) indicated that crystalline structure tended towards integrity and the particle size of SnO 2 increased with the increase of calcination temperature. The interaction between gold and support is of substantial importance in the case of CO oxidation. The smaller SnO 2 nanoparticles may supply more active sites and contribute to the strong interaction between gold and nanocrystalline SnO 2 . Therefore, the catalytic activity of Au/SnO 2 (573 K) was better as compared to that of Au/SnO 2 (>673 K). On the other hand, the degree of crystallinity of the support also brought markedly influence on the catalytic activity. Therefore, the Au/SnO 2 (573 K) catalyst was more active than the Au/SnO 2 (473 K). We suggested that the catalytic activity of Au/SnO 2 catalysts was related to both the particle size and the degree of crystallinity of tin dioxide support. Figs. 8 and 9 show the relationship between the activity and the Au loading in Au/SnO 2 catalysts. The loading of gold in the Au/SnO 2 catalysts markedly influenced the catalytic activity. The optimum Au loading was 2.86 wt.%, which had an appreciably high catalytic activity [the temperature of 100% CO conversion ( T 100% ) was 303 K]. When the Au loading was below 2.86 wt.%, T 100% decreased with the increase of the gold loading. On the other hand, when the Au loading was above 2.86 wt.%, T 100% increased with the increase of the gold loading. This indicated that a proper Au loading was necessary to gain high activity Au catalyst. From the XRD results ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ), we could see that when the Au loading was above 2.86 wt.%, the average size of gold particles significantly increased with the increase of Au loading, which could be an important factor resulted in the decrease of catalytic activity. Fig. 10 shows the influence of the calcination temperature of 1.43 wt.% Au/SnO 2 catalysts on the catalytic activity. The uncalcined material had no activity when the reaction temperature was below 423 K. The catalyst pretreated at 423 K had already had certain activity, which could oxidize CO to CO 2 at 323 K, and the T 100% was 383 K. With the increase of calcination temperature, the catalytic activity increased. The catalyst calcined at 473 K showed the best catalytic performance ( T 100% was 333 K). When the calcination temperature was above 573 K, with the increase of calcination temperature, a decrease in the catalytic activity could be observed. The sample calcined at 773 K displayed no activity when reaction temperature was below 393 K. The results reported in the present paper showed that the catalytic behavior of the Au/SnO 2 system was remarkably influenced by the thermal pretreatment of the catalyst. A calcination pretreatment was necessary to activate the catalyst, but the activity decreased rapidly in high pretreatment temperature above 673 K. The XPS analyses results showed for the sample uncalcined and calcined at 423 K, the fraction of Au 0 was lower than the samples calcined above 473 K. Increasing the calcination temperature, the fraction of Au 0 increased. The samples calcined above 473 K showed the Au 4f 7/2 peak centered at 84.2 eV and Au 4f 5/2 peak centered at 87.8 eV, which was characteristics of Au 0 . This indicated that the fraction of Au 0 markedly influenced the catalytic activity, which resulted in the catalyst calcined at 473 K was more active than the catalysts uncalcined and calcined at 423 K. Higher calcination temperature than 673 K result in the formation of bigger (>10 nm) Au agglomerates, and these catalysts demonstrated lower activity as compared to the ones containing mostly small Au nanoparticles. It was clear that during the calcination above 673 K the sintering of Au clusters of the catalysts would occur, which resulted in a rapid decrease in the catalytic activity after high pretreatment temperature above 673 K. From the XRD and TEM results, we suggested that the increasing size of the gold particles was responsible for the decreasing catalytic activity at higher calcination temperature. 4 Conclusions The calcination temperature of SnO 2 support had an evidently influence on catalytic activity of Au/SnO 2 catalysts, and SnO 2 samples calcined at 573 and 673 K were suitable support materials for the Au/SnO 2 catalysts. From the XRD results, it was suggested that the catalytic activity of Au/SnO 2 catalysts were related to both the particle size and the degree of crystallinity of tin dioxide support. The loading of gold in the Au/SnO 2 catalysts markedly influenced the catalytic activity. In all investigated Au/SnO 2 catalysts with different Au loading from 0.36 to 5.00 wt.%, the catalytic activity of the catalyst with 2.86 wt.% Au loading was the highest. When the Au loading was below 2.86 wt.%, the catalytic activity increased with the increase of the Au loading. On the other hand, when the Au loading was above 2.86 wt.%, the catalytic activity decreased with the increase of the Au loading. The results reported in the present paper showed that the catalytic behavior of the Au/SnO 2 system was remarkably influenced by the thermal pretreatment of the catalyst. The optimum calcination temperature of the Au/SnO 2 catalysts was 473 K. A calcination pretreatment was necessary to activate the catalyst, but the activity decreased rapidly when the pretreatment temperature was higher than 673 K. The XPS analyses results showed that the fraction of metallic state Au markedly influenced the catalytic activity, which resulted in the catalyst calcined at 473 K was more active than the catalysts uncalcined and calcined at 423 K. From the XRD and TEM results, we suggested that the increasing size of the gold particles was responsible for the decreasing catalytic activity at higher calcination temperature. References [1] T.

The catalytic properties of the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation were studied by using a microreactor-GC system.

XPS analysis indicated the presence of reduced copper species in the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. TPR showed that there are different copper species in the catalysts. The influence of calcination time, temperature and CuO loadings on the catalytic activity of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts has been studied. The CuO/CeO 2 (sol\u2013gel) catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity than the CuO/CeO 2 (commercial) catalysts.

        "abstract": "Polypyrrole (PPy) was prepared by chemical oxidation using methoxy ethanol as solvent and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O as oxidant. PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 was prepared by simultaneously gelling and polymerization, using the same solvent and oxidant. The materials were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TG-DTA, SEM, and HRTEM, and studied for the gas sensitivity. From the TG-DTA curve of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 , we found that the degradation temperature of PPy was about 210 \u00b0C, so the annealing temperatures of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 were selected at 110 \u00b0C, 150 \u00b0C, 180 \u00b0C, and 200 \u00b0C. The influence of the mole ratio of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O to py = 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 on the gas sensitivities of PPy was investigated. It was found that PPy had the maximum sensitivity to NH 3 and H 2 S at the mole ratio of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O:py = 3:1 at room temperature, and the sensitivities were 48.5 and 31.4, respectively. PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 materials had no gas sensitivity at room temperature. When the working temperature increased to 90 \u00b0C, PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 materials appeared gas sensitivity, PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 annealed at 150 \u00b0C had the maximum sensitivity to NH 3 and H 2 S, and the sensitivities were 68 and 406.8, respectively, but PPy lost gas sensitivity at this temperature. The results suggested that PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 had higher sensitivity and more heat stability than PPy, and the working temperature was lower than the reported working temperature of r-Fe 2 O 3 about 350 \u00b0C, it had better properties than both pure PPy and r-Fe 2 O 3 . Keywords Sensitivity Polypyrrole r-Fe 2 O 3 Toxic gases 1 Introduction In order to prevent human from being harmed by toxic gas and to protect the environment, the detection of toxic gas has become increasingly important. The sensing materials, which are inorganic or organic, have been studied widely [1\u201314] . But both of them have particular advantage and drawbacks. Though inorganic semiconductors, such as SnO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , and ZnO, either undoped or doped have been studied extensively [1\u20136] and have emerged as economical sensors for monitoring toxic gases, the disadvantages of semiconductor oxide sensors are their high operating temperature (350\u2013450 \u00b0C) [15,16] , which increases power consumption, reduces sensor life, and limits the portability. Several organic semiconductors, such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophere, polyacetylene, etc. also have gas sensitivity at normal temperature [7\u201314] . Polypyrrole is the most studied among these, but the self-limitations reduce the application largely. Because PPy is sensitivity to electrochemical and chemical degradation and the conductivity exhibits a long-term irreversible decay due to the irreversible attack of oxygen present in the ambient, and the long response time due to the highly ordered structure [17] . To prepare the optimized properties materials, organic\u2013inorganic sensing hybrids have been developed [18,19] , considering which can complement the characteristics of pure inorganic and organic materials. The relating studies for gas sensors are few. Benjamin et al. [20] reported the polypyrrole/SnO 2 had sensitivity to organic vapors at room temperature. Suri et al. [21] studied the pressure and humidity sensitivity of polypyrrole/iron oxide. These types of hybrid materials have been shown to possess small grain size and high stability in air [22,23] . Nardis et al. [24] reported that cobalt porphyrin/tin dioxide had superior selectivity to methanol vapor than to CO. In this paper, we prepared polypyrrole (PPy) by chemical oxidation and PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 by simultaneously gelling and polymerization. Methoxy ethanol was used as solvent and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O as oxidant in the two reactions. The samples were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TG-DTA, SEM, and HRTEM, and the gas sensitivity of them was then studied. To the best of our knowledge it is the first time to study the gas sensitivity of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 to toxic gases, and for comparison the gas sensitivity of PPy was also studied at the same condition. 2 Experiment Pyrrole (py) monomer was distilled under reduced pressure, put in a desiccator, and stored in the refrigerator to use. PPy was prepared by chemical oxidation in nitrogen atmosphere. Methoxy ethanol was added to a specific amount of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O contained in a 100-ml round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar, and then few drops of distilled pyrrole were added to the stirred solution (the mole ratio of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O:pyrrole monomer = 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1, respectively). After a reaction time of 1.5 h, the mixture was filtered and the black precipitate was obtained. The product was washed with water, followed by ethanol and dried in vacuum. PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 was prepared as reference [21] . Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O and pyrrole monomer were added to methoxy ethanol in a certain ratio, the solution was continuously stirred and heated at a slow rate to evaporate the solvent, and the blackish powder was produced. The power was annealed at different temperature 110 \u00b0C, 150 \u00b0C, 180 \u00b0C, and 200 \u00b0C. In order to determine the properties of PPy and PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 , several structural investigations, such as FTIR (Avatar 360 FTIR spectrophotometer), X-ray diffraction (DMAX-2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) (ZRY-2P Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer), scanning electron microscope (SEM) (X-650, Japan, operated at 25 kV), and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (Philips T20ST, operated at 200 kV) had been carried out. In sensitivity experiment, NH 3 and H 2 S were selected to detect, and the concentrations were 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The sensitive materials were fabricated on an aluminum tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. A Ni\u2013Cr alloy through the tube was used as heating filament. The sensor's voltage was measured indirectly by an external resistor in the testing circuit. The gas sensitivity S is defined as S = 100| V g \u2212 V a |/ V a , where V a is the initial voltage of the sensor in clear air and V g is the voltage of the sensor when it was exposed to testing gases. All experiments were carried out in a fixing humidity of 60%. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 The characterizations of materials The FTIR transmission spectra of PPy and PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 using KBr pellets were recorded ( Fig. 1 ). In the spectra of PPy, the specific absorption bands are observed at 1560 cm \u22121 , 1398 cm \u22121 , 1298 cm \u22121 , 1211 cm \u22121 , 1047 cm \u22121 , 930 cm \u22121 , and 790 cm \u22121 . They are close to those reported data [25,26] : stretching vibration (1560 cm \u22121 ) of C C bond, stretching vibration (1298 cm \u22121 ) of C C bond, stretching vibration (1211 cm \u22121 ) of C N bond, and bond (1398 cm \u22121 ) of pyrrole ring. In the PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 spectra, peaks of PPy are found at 1398 cm \u22121 , 1047 cm \u22121 , and 790 cm \u22121 , and the bands of r-Fe 2 O 3 appeared in the range 400\u2013800 cm \u22121 . In the two spectra, the C O bond in pyrrolidone about 1700 cm \u22121 is clear, which due to the overoxidation of PPy. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 annealed at 150 \u00b0C. Since the low annealing temperature, only the peaks 2 \u03b8 = 35.18, 45.22, 61.58 with h k l values (3 1 3), (4 0 0), and (5 2 3) corresponding to r-Fe 2 O 3 phase are observed. Fig. 3 is the TG-DTA curve of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 . From it we can see two exothermic peaks around 210 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C, which attribute to the degradation of PPy and the phase transformation of r-Fe 2 O 3 to \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , respectively. Only one weight loss in TG curve is due to PPy degradation and the phase transformation does not result weight loss. So in order to obtain PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 material, the anneal temperature below 200 \u00b0C should be adopted. From the SEM picture ( Fig. 4 ), we can see that the pattern of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 is uniform and the particle of r-Fe 2 O 3 is spherical. The HRTEM picture ( Fig. 5 ) shows that the r-Fe 2 O 3 particle is also spherical which is identical to SEM results and the r-Fe 2 O 3 particles are dispersed in PPy with the particle size around 20 nm. 3.2 The gas sensitivity detection The gas sensitivity of PPy and PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 was studied at room temperature and 90 \u00b0C, respectively. At room temperature, the sensitivity variation of PPy to NH 3 or H 2 S with different mole ratio of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O:pyrrole monomer = 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 5:1 was studied ( Fig. 6 ). It showed that the maximum sensitivity of PPy to NH 3 or H 2 S was prepared at the mole ratio of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O:py = 3:1, and the sensitivities are 48.5 and 31.4, respectively. The response curves of PPy to NH 3 and H 2 S are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . Because PPy is a p-type semiconductor, the resistance of PPy increased when it exposed to the electron donating gas NH 3 ( Fig. 7 ) [9] . Though H 2 S is a reducing gas similar to NH 3 , the resistance of PPy decreased instead of increasing as expected ( Fig. 8 ) [11,27] . This can be explained that H 2 S that is not dry absolutely can dissociate to HS \u2212 and H + at normal temperature and pressure, PPy is doped by H + when exposed to H 2 S gas, which can increase the vacancy concentration in PPy. The related study of proton doping processes was reported by Kriv\u00e1n et al. [27] . But at room temperature, PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 has no gas sensitivity to NH 3 and H 2 S. When the temperature increased to 90 \u00b0C, PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 appeared gas sensitivity to NH 3 and H 2 S. But at this working temperature, it was found that the resistance of PPy increased rapidly, and the sensitivity of PPy to NH 3 and H 2 S disappeared. It maybe the liner structure of PPy was damaged at higher temperature, and which hindrance the migration of vacancy along the PPy liner chain. Fig. 9 shows the sensitivity of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 annealed at different temperature to NH 3 and H 2 S at 90 \u00b0C. From it we can see that at different annealing temperature the sensitivity sequences of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 to NH 3 or H 2 S are S (150 \u00b0C) > S (110 \u00b0C) > S (200 \u00b0C) > S (180 \u00b0C) . The sensitivity at 200 \u00b0C is higher than that of 180 \u00b0C. This may be that a small part of PPy in PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 degraded at 200 \u00b0C, so the mass composition of PPy and r-Fe 2 O 3 in PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 at 200 \u00b0C is changed comparing to that of at 110 \u00b0C, 150 \u00b0C, and 180 \u00b0C. The hybrid material annealed at 150 \u00b0C has the highest sensitivity at 90 \u00b0C. Figs. 10 and 11 are the response curves of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 annealed at 150 \u00b0C to 0.2% NH 3 and 0.1% H 2 S at 90 \u00b0C. The sensitivity of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 to NH 3 and H 2 S are 68 and 406.8, respectively, which are all higher than those of PPy at room temperature. When exposed to NH 3 gas, the resistance of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 decreased showing the character of n-type semiconductor different to PPy. Since two types of semiconductors were in PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 , two competitive mechanisms within it [18] . In this process, the n-type semiconductor r-Fe 2 O 3 may have the decisive effect. When exposed to H 2 S gas, PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 also exhibited the character of n-type semiconductor, which may be the co-effect of proton doping process and the r-Fe 2 O 3 's effect. But the true response mechanism of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 to NH 3 and H 2 S is not clear and under research. 4 Conclusion In order to develop the new gas sensors, we put emphasis on organic\u2013inorganic materials, and firstly studied the gas sensitivity of PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 to NH 3 and H 2 S. The materials were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TG-DTA, SEM, and HRTEM. The r-Fe 2 O 3 particle in PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 was spherical as it can be seen from SEM and HRTEM. The results of gas sensitivity test suggested that PPy had the maximum sensitivity to NH 3 and H 2 S at the mole ratio Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O:py = 3:1 at room temperature, but the sensitivity disappeared at 90 \u00b0C. On the contrary, PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 appeared sensitivity to NH 3 and H 2 S at 90 \u00b0C, and the material annealed at 150 \u00b0C had the maximum sensitivity among different annealing temperature at this working temperature. PPy/r-Fe 2 O 3 had more heat stability than PPy, higher gas sensitivity than PPy at room temperature and lower working temperature than r-Fe 2 O 3 about 350 \u00b0C [28,29] , showing that it had better properties than either pure PPy or r-Fe 2 O 3 . This type of material has good potential application in gas sensors and it is a challenge subject to study as well. References [1] C. Baratto G. Sberveglien A. Onischuk Sens.

        "abstract": "The porous TiO2 microspheres were prepared by the reversed-phase suspension polymerization and sol-gel method. The CuO/TiO2 catalysts with porous microspheres composed of TiO2 nanocrystals as the support were prepared by impregnation method. The properties of the porous TiO2 microspheres and CuO/TiO2 catalysts were studied by TG-DTA,X-ray diffraction,XPS and ICP. The catalytic properties of the catalysts for CO oxidation were studied via a microreactor-GC system. The results show that the porous microspheres were mainly composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with a size of 19.5 nm. The XPS results indicate that there was interaction between the support and the active component,and Cu mainly existed as Cu2+ with some other form. The catalytic activity of the catalysts depends on the concentration of the impregnation solution and the calcination temperature of the CuO/TiO2 catalysts. The catalyst impregnated in 0.5 mol/L Cu ( NO3 )2 \u00b73H2O had a better catalytic activity. The optimum calcination temperature of the CuO/TiO2 catalysts was 200 \u2103.",

The catalytic properties of the CuO/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 nanocatalysts were evaluated by low-temperature carbon monoxide oxidation using a microreactor-GC system. XRD and TEM analysis indicated that the catalyst particles were nanoscaled with cubic, fluorite structure. N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms revealed a mesoporous nanocatalyst system with high-surface area and uniform pore-size distribution. The results of catalytic activity measurements showed that these mesoporous nanostructured CuO/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts were very active for low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalytic behavior depended on the CuO loading amount, the calcination temperature, the surface area and the particle size of the catalyst. The catalyst with 25 mol% CuO loading and calcined at 400 \u00b0C exhibited the highest catalytic activity.

The influences of gas concentration, operating temperature, crystallite (grain) size and structure feature on the sensing performance of the sensors based on SnO 2 hollow spheres were comprehensively studied. The SnO 2 hollow spheres had a mean crystallite size of 12.7, 14.1 and 22.8 nm when calcined at 450, 500 and 550 \u00b0C, respectively. It was found that the SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C with a crystallite size of 12.7 nm were the most sensitive to NO 2 gas. The sensor also had a better selectivity to NO 2 than to ethanol, methanol, gasoline, acetone, CCl 4 and NH 3 when operated at 160 \u00b0C. Keywords SnO 2 hollow sphere Sensor NO 2 Response Selectivity 1 Introduction As an n-type semiconductor, SnO 2 has been extensively studied for various applications, including gas sensors [1,2] , catalyst support [3] , transparent conducting electrodes [4] and Li-ion battery anode materials [5,6] . Studies have proved that the properties and performances of SnO 2 -based devices can be dramatically influenced by structure features. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the synthesis of nanostructured SnO 2 materials, such as nanowires [7\u20139] , nanotubes [10\u201312] , nanoribbons or nanobelts [13\u201316] , nanorods [17\u201320] , macroporous films [21] , mesoporous SnO 2 [22\u201326] , hollow spheres [5,6,27\u201331] . Among these nanostructures, the porous SnO 2 material has been paid large attention and widely studied as gas sensing material. For example, Li and co-workers [31] and Wu and co-workers [32] investigated the ethanol sensing properties of SnO 2 hollow spheres templated by carbon microspheres. Martinez et al. [27] found that Sb:SnO 2 hollow spheres showed high sensitivity to methanol. Egashira and co-workers [21] synthesized macroporous SnO 2 films that exhibited good sensitivity to H 2 , NO and NO 2 . Wagner et al. [26] studied the sensing properties of mesoporous SnO 2 to CO. Very recently, Tiemann [33] comprehensively reviewed the fundamental influence factors of a gas sensor based on porous metal oxide, such as composition, operating temperature, porosity and grain size. Gas sensor with a porous structure could contribute to improved sensing performances because of enhanced active surface area and efficient gas diffusion induced by this unique structure [21,31\u201334] . However, most studies have demonstrated this point only in theory and are not convincing due to the lack of comparison in sensing performances between porous SnO 2 material and solid SnO 2 material. The only report that can be traced in the literature is presented by Li and co-workers [31] , comparing the ethanol sensing performances of SnO 2 hollow spheres and that of SnO 2 nanopowders. To the best knowledge of us, researches on exploring SnO 2 hollow spheres as sensing material are still in an early stage, and there are few reports on using SnO 2 hollow spheres to detect NO 2 gas. It is well-known that NO 2 , an irritant gas that can cause respiratory infections, photochemical smog and acid rain [35] , is badly harmful to human life and health. Thus, it is imperative to develop an applicable sensor for detecting NO 2 gas. In the present study, we systematically examine the sensing performance of SnO 2 hollow spheres to NO 2 gas, as well as some other gases. The temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent behaviors of the sensors based on SnO 2 hollow spheres to NO 2 are investigated. The effect of crystallite (grain) size of SnO 2 hollow spheres related to calcination temperature on NO 2 sensing performance is discussed. Moreover, a comparative study between SnO 2 hollow spheres and SnO 2 particles is carried out to depict the structure influence on sensing performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O), absolute ethanol and glucose were all of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Distilled water was used in the experiment. 2.2 Preparation of carbon microspheres Carbon microspheres were prepared as described elsewhere [31,36] . In a typical procedure, a clear solution containing 10 g of glucose and 80 mL of water was placed in a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 160 \u00b0C for 5 h. The purple-brown products were centrifuged and rinsed with distilled water and ethanol for several times, then oven-dried at 80 \u00b0C for 5 h. 2.3 Preparation of SnO 2 hollow spheres Differing from the reported procedure [31,36] , experimental parameters in our work have been slightly modified. In our synthesis, 0.98 g of SnCl 2 was dissolved in 20 mL of absolute ethanol under stirring, 1 g of carbon microspheres were uniformly dispersed in 40 mL of absolute ethanol by ultrasonication, then the SnCl 2 solution was added into the 40 mL of absolute ethanol at a speed of 5 s per drop. After ultrasonicating for 1 h, the mixed solution was aged under ambient conditions for two days. The resulting precursor was collected by centrifugation and washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 40 \u00b0C in vacuum overnight. SnO 2 hollow spheres were finally obtained after the as-prepared precursor was calcined at different temperatures (450, 500 and 550 \u00b0C) for 2 h in a muffle furnace. Unlike the reported procedure [31,36] , we did not introduce the required amount of water (1 mL) into the mixed solution during ultrasonication. It is well-known that Sn (II) is prone to hydrolyze in water, and this is not favourable for the adsorption of Sn (II) onto the surface of carbon microspheres through coordination or electrostatic interactions. What is worse, Sn(OH) 2 , the product of hydrolyzation, would turn to solid SnO 2 particles rather than hollow spheres during calcination. 2.4 Fabrication of a gas sensor An appropriate amount of as-prepared SnO 2 hollow spheres were slightly ground together with some water in an agate mortar. Then, the slurry was screen-coated onto an alumina tube soldered with a pair of Au electrodes and four Pt wires on both ends of the tube. A Ni-Cr alloy coil through the tube was employed as a heating filament. Finally, the Al 2 O 3 tube was welded onto a pedestal with six probes. 2.5 Measurements of sensing performance Gas sensing measurements were performed on a commercial HW-30A system (HanWei Electronics Co., Ltd., Henan Province, China). The sensor signal is recorded by a computer at a constant test voltage of 5 V. The operating temperature is controlled by tuning the heating voltage. The sensor response to NO 2 gas is defined as the ratio ( R g / R a ) of the electrical resistance in test gas ( R g ) to that in air ( R a ). While for reducing gases, such as ethanol, methanol and gasoline, it is defined as R a / R g . Different concentrations of NO 2 gas were tested in the following sequence, 5, 20, 50 and 100 ppm at a relative humidity (RH) of 20\u201335%. 2.6 Characterization Phase identification was performed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared SnO 2 hollow spheres were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Shimadzu SS-550, 15 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips FEI Tecnai 20ST, 200 kV), respectively. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) specific surface area was measured on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. 3 Results and discussion The carbon microspheres derived from hydrothermal conditions were hydrophilic with plenty of \u2013OH and C O groups on the surface. These functional groups enabled the carbon microspheres to bind metal cations. The carbon microspheres loaded with metal cations gave rise to hollow metal oxide spheres after the carbon cores sacrificed in the form of CO 2 during calcination. Details of carbon microspheres and mechanism of the formation of carbon microspheres-metal cation precursor can be found elsewhere [36,37] . To evaluate the effect of calcination temperature on sensing performance of SnO 2 hollow spheres, the as-prepared precursor was calcined at different temperatures. The XRD patterns of SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450, 500 and 550 \u00b0C are compared in Fig. 1 . All diffraction peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO 2 and no characteristic peaks are observed for impurities, such as SnO or carbon, manifesting the complete remove of carbon microspheres and well crystallization of SnO 2 . It can also be seen that the peak intensity increases and the width decreases on increasing calcination temperature. The mean crystallite sizes of SnO 2 hollow spheres with different calcination temperature (450, 500 and 550 \u00b0C) were calculated to be 12.7, 14.1 and 22.8 nm by Debye\u2013Scherrer formula, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 , a significant crystallite growth occurred at above 500 \u00b0C, the crystallite size of SnO 2 calcined at 550 \u00b0C is almost two times as large as that calcined at 450 \u00b0C. SEM images of SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C of different magnification are shown in Fig. 3 (A and B) . Hollow spheres with a small opening in the shells can be clearly observed in the two images. Most of the SnO 2 hollow spheres have a diameter of about 600 nm. TEM images of SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 4 , providing further insights into the structure of SnO 2 hollow spheres. It is clear that the hollow spheres have a rough morphology with a diameter of 500\u2013700 nm. Details of the shells can be seen in Fig. 4 (B\u2013D), revealing that the shells are porous with a thickness of about 25 nm and consist of massive SnO 2 particles. The diffraction rings in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ( Fig. 4 (E)) confirm the polycrystalline structure of SnO 2 hollow spheres [7,30,38] . Fig. S1(supplementary data) shows the schematic configuration of a gas sensor. Much effort has been focused on exploring sensing material for the detection of NO 2 . However, satisfactory sensitivity and recovery of the sensors could be only achieved by exposure to UV light [15] or at an elevated temperature [16,21] , which are not favourable and convenient for practical use. Previous studies have proved that higher sensitivity could be achieved by a hollow or porous structure of sensor because of enhancement in active surface area and better gas diffusion [21,31\u201334] . It is evident that the porous shells could facilitate gas diffusion and make gas molecules accessible to both the exterior and the interior surfaces of SnO 2 hollow spheres. Response\u2013recovery curves of SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at different temperatures to different NO 2 concentrations are compared in Fig. 5 (A\u2013D) . We have also investigated the operating temperature-dependent sensing behaviors of SnO 2 hollow spheres from 120 to 220 \u00b0C in a step of 20 \u00b0C. It is clear that the response\u2013recovery curves descend or ascend sharply with NO 2 gas in or out. Here, the response time is defined as the time for sensor to reach 90% of the maximum response. It can be seen that the response times decrease on increasing NO 2 concentration at the same operating temperature. Taking the response curves at 160 \u00b0C for example, the response times to 5, 20, 50 and 100 ppm NO 2 are 90, 20, 10 and 5 s, respectively. On the other hand, the recovery curves ascend quickly on increasing operating temperature, with values of about several minutes at 120 and 140 \u00b0C, 25 s at 160 and 180 \u00b0C, 10 s at 200 and 220 \u00b0C. It seems that the recovery time is not so much dependent on NO 2 concentration as compared with the response time, while increasing the operating temperature contributes a lot to the reduction of recovery time. Thus, it can be concluded that a higher NO 2 concentration could shorten the response time and a higher operating temperature could promote the recovery process. It is noteworthy that all the sensors exhibit a fast response\u2013recovery characteristic at a temperature above 160 \u00b0C in spite of NO 2 concentration as low as 5 ppm. Especially, the response time to 50 or 100 ppm NO 2 at all operating temperatures can be shorter than 10 s. Actually, when operated at 200 or 220 \u00b0C, the sensors almost exhibit an instantaneous response to 50 or 100 ppm NO 2 within 2 s and recover to the baseline within 10 s. It should be pointed out that the calcination temperature also affects the sensing performances of SnO 2 hollow spheres. As shown in Fig. 5 (A\u2013D), the dotted lines (450 \u00b0C) show a larger response compared with dashed lines (500 \u00b0C) and solid lines (550 \u00b0C). However, the solid lines (550 \u00b0C) recover to the baseline a little faster than the two others in all the NO 2 tests. This can be attributed to the difference in SnO 2 crystallite sizes. It has been reported that grain size has an important influence on the sensing performance of sensors [39\u201344] . The sensor sensitivity can increase sharply as the crystallite size of SnO 2 decreases to a critical value (5\u201315 nm), corresponding to twice the thickness of depletion layer [42,43] . In this case, energy band bending is no longer restricted to the surface region, but extends into the bulk of the grains [41] . However, those reports [40\u201344] mainly discussed the effect of grain size on the sensing performance of sensors to reducing gases, such as H 2, ethanol, CO and H 2 S, rather than NO 2 . Here, as shown in Fig. 6 (A) , it is found that SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C with the smallest crystallite size (12.7 nm) showed the highest response to all NO 2 concentrations, while those calcined at 550 \u00b0C with the largest crystallite size (22.8 nm) had the lowest. Consequently, it can be concluded in this work that smaller crystallite size gives rise to higher response. The sensitivities of SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C to different NO 2 concentrations at different operating temperatures are compared in Fig. 6 (B). Obviously, the sensor shows a maximum response when operated at 160 \u00b0C. Usually, the optimum operating temperature is defined as the temperature at which a gas sensor shows a maximum response to a specified target gas concentration. However, such a definition is not comprehensive for that the sensing performance of a sensor is characterized not only by sensitivity but also by speed (response\u2013recovery time), selectivity and stability \u201c4s\u201d. Thus, a contradiction may arise at the so-called optimum operating temperature with respect to \u201c4s\u201d. In this work, the contradiction goes like this, the sensor shows a maximum response to NO 2 at 160 \u00b0C, but the recovery time is longer than that at 200 or 220 \u00b0C. Consequently, a compromise [45] should be considered in defining the optimum operating temperature with regard to \u201c4s\u201d. It should be pointed out that, as shown in Fig. 6 (B), the response begin to decline when NO 2 concentration exceeds 50 ppm, but still has a value as high as 2229 to 100 ppm NO 2 , which is far higher than the reported result [21] . To substantiate the effect of structure on sensing performances of the sensors, a comparative study between SnO 2 hollow spheres and solid SnO 2 particles was performed. The SnO 2 particles prepared by ammonia precipitation have a mean crystallite size of 11.8 nm calculated by Scherrer equation on the basis of XRD pattern ( Fig. S2, supplementary data ). The BET surface area of the prepared SnO 2 particles was 37 m 2 /g, which is smaller than that (48 m 2 /g) of SnO 2 hollow spheres. Response\u2013recovery curves of SnO 2 particles to different NO 2 concentrations at 160 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 7 . Detailed comparison of the sensing performances of SnO 2 hollow spheres and solid SnO 2 particles is illustrated in Table 1 . It can be seen that the response times of SnO 2 hollow spheres to all NO 2 concentrations are shorter than those of SnO 2 particles except 5 ppm. Note that the recovery times and sensitivities of the two sensors show even remarkable differences. All the recovery times of SnO 2 hollow spheres are no more than 10 s, whereas the recovery times of SnO 2 particles are no less than 15 min. The large differences in response and recovery times of the two sensors can be attributed to their different structures. Gas sensor based on SnO 2 hollow spheres has a loose and porous structure compared with tightly contacted SnO 2 particles. When the sensor was exposed to NO 2 gas, NO 2 molecules could diffuse more quickly to react with oxygen species on the inner surfaces of SnO 2 hollow spheres compared with compact SnO 2 particles. As a result, the resistance change of SnO 2 hollow spheres could reach the maximum in a shorter time. As the exposure time is prolonged, gas molecules could penetrate deeper into the body of sensors and cause reactions therein [31] . The recovery time, mainly determined by desorption\u2013diffusion process, is reduced in that NO 2 molecules could diffuse out more easily and quickly from SnO 2 hollow spheres than from SnO 2 particles. Another significant difference comes from the response. The responses of SnO 2 hollow spheres are far higher than those of SnO 2 particles. Since that SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C and SnO 2 particles calcined at 400 \u00b0C have similar crystallite sizes (12.7 and 11.8 nm), the large difference in response is also related to their different structures. As mentioned earlier, the porous shells could make gas molecules accessible to both the exterior and the interior surfaces of SnO 2 hollow spheres. Adsorbed oxygen species (O 2 \u2212 , O \u2212 and O 2\u2212 ) [46,47] could trap electrons located on the surface of sensing material, generating an electron depletion layer, thus a pair of electron depletion layers could formed on both the outer and the inner surfaces of hollow spheres ( Fig. 8 ). In the case of SnO 2 particles, only one electron depletion layer could formed on the sensor surface, consequently, the reactive surface area is relatively lower compared with SnO 2 hollow spheres. This can also be confirmed by their different BET surface areas, which is generally considered that larger specific surface area contributes to better sensor performance [33] . In other words, the change amplitude in conductivity or resistance of SnO 2 particles induced by surface reaction is smaller than that of SnO 2 hollow spheres, leading to a reduced response. To examine the selectivity of the sensor, SnO 2 hollow spheres calcined at 450 \u00b0C were also tested to other gases, including ethanol, methanol, gasoline, acetone, CCl 4 and NH 3 . It was found that the sensor showed no response to acetone, CCl 4 and NH 3 (not shown here). As can be seen in Fig. 9 , the response curve is sunk to NO 2 and raised to ethanol, methanol and gasoline. The sensor is more sensitive to NO 2 and ethanol than to methanol and gasoline. However, as shown in Fig. 10 , the sensitivities to NO 2 and ethanol show a large difference with a value of 2471 to NO 2 , while only 9.3 to ethanol. Thus, it is believed that the SnO 2 hollow-sphere sensor has a good selectivity to NO 2 . Such a large difference was also observed by Kaur et al. [48] Differing from their WO 3 -doping effect, the large difference in our case can be attributed to the different sensing mechanisms of NO 2 and ethanol. NO 2 mainly acts as an electron accepter in the surface reactions and the width of electron depletion layers is increased, leading to a increased resistance of the sensors [15,49] . While in the case of ethanol, which mainly acts as an electron donor, it would release the electrons trapped by the oxygen species to SnO 2 sensors, resulting in a decreased resistance of the sensor. Moreover, it was found that the response\u2013recovery curves of the SnO 2 hollow-sphere sensor to NO 2 gas showed no obvious change even after several months, confirming the stability of the sensors. 4 Conclusions In summary, sensors based on SnO 2 hollow spheres were fabricated and tested to NO 2 , as well as ethanol, methanol, gasoline, acetone, CCl 4 and NH 3 . Obtained results demonstrated that the SnO 2 hollow-sphere sensor showed much higher response and good selectivity to NO 2 than to other gases at 160 \u00b0C. Besides the benefits from the porous structure of SnO 2 hollow spheres, the crystallite size also plays an important role in the NO 2 sensing performance. It is confirmed that the response of SnO 2 hollow spheres to NO 2 gas decreases with increasing crystallite size. Comparative study between SnO 2 hollow spheres and SnO 2 particles exemplifies that the porous structure contributes a lot to the sensing performance of sensor in respect of response\u2013recovery time and response. It is believed that the SnO 2 hollow-sphere sensor is a promising candidate for the efficient detection of NO 2 gas at a ppm-level. In addition, this work also indicates that it is possible to explore novel sensing material for detecting other gases by controlling crystallite size and constructing porous structure.

The catalytic properties of the catalysts were studied by using a microreactor-GC system. XRD analysis showed Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 was cubic, fluorite structure for all the catalysts. The XPS indicated the valence of Ce atom was +4 and there were reduced copper species presented in the CuO/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalyst. The results showed that the CuO loadings, calcination temperature and calcination time affected the catalytic activity of the catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. For comparison, the catalytic activities of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures were also studied. The results indicated that CuO/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalyst had better thermal resistance than CuO/CeO 2 catalyst and had inferior activity than the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst when they were both calcined at 600 \u00b0C.",

        "abstract": "Supported Au catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation were prepared by solvated metal atom impregnation (SMAI) and conventional impregnation (CI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations indicated that gold in all the samples was in the metallic state. TEM and XRD measurements showed that the mean diameter of Au particles prepared by SMAI was smaller than that of those prepared by CI with the same gold content. Catalytic tests showed that SMAI catalysts had higher CO oxidation activity than CI catalysts with the same compositions. Both SMAI and CI Au/TiO 2 catalysts exhibited high activities in low temperature CO oxidation. Full CO conversion was obtained at 323 K for 3.1 wt.% Au/TiO 2 (SMAI) catalyst, which displayed higher activity than the 3.1 wt.% Au/D-72 (SMAI) and 3.1 wt.% Au/TiO 2 (CI). Although the sizes of gold particles prepared by the same method and supported on both TiO 2 and resin were comparable, the Au/TiO 2 catalysts showed significantly higher activities than the Au/resin catalysts with the same Au contents under the same reaction conditions. These results prove that not only the gold particle size, but also the support plays a key role in CO oxidation.",

The results show that the average diameter of tin dioxide particles dried at 353 K was about 2 nm. Even if the tin dioxide particles were calcined at 873 K, the average diameter of particles was less than 10 nm. The removal of Cl- was solved by using this kind of method. The mechanism of the formation of tin dioxide nano-sized particles was proposed and analyzed in this paper. We also measured the sensitivity of the sensor based on the tin oxide powder calcined at 673 K to NH3, alcohol, acetone, hexane and CO. The gas-sensing performance results indicate that this sensor has a higher sensitivity to alcohol and acetone, and selectivity for NH3, hexane and CO at an operating temperature of 343 K.",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystalline undoped and Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 powders were synthesized by an anhydrous solvent method and characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron micrograph (TEM). The gas sensitivity measurements indicated that both the undoped (operated at 240 \u00b0C) and the 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors (operated at 270 \u00b0C) exhibited high response to acetone and ethanol, moderate response to petrol, poor response to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), H 2 and CO. Furthermore, the 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensor presented shorter response and recovery times, better long-time stability, larger response and better selectivity to acetone and ethanol than the undoped sensor. The present undoped and Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors obtained by an anhydrous solvent method were almost insensitive to LPG, while the reported \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors prepared by a hydrous solution method were generally sensitive to LPG, suggesting that the preparation method played a key role in determining the gas sensing properties. Keywords Anhydrous solvent method \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 Gas sensing property Sensitivity 1 Introduction \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 is a good gas-sensitive material. Gas sensors prepared with this material have been used as detectors for some combustible and toxic gases [1\u20134] . Despite \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 -based sensors have many merits, such as high sensitivity, low cost, quick response and low power consumption; there still exist many works to do for further improvement of their gas sensing properties. Previous literatures demonstrated that the gas sensing properties of \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 -based sensors were greatly affected by the addition of other metal oxides and the preparation method [1\u20133] . An available and effective approach is to incorporate transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides into the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 material. For instance, Wang et al. [1] reported that the gas sensitivity of \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 to H 2 and LPG was greatly promoted by the addition of Ag 2 O, Al 2 O 3 and PtO. Tao et al. [2] found that the gas sensitivity of \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 to ethanol could be increased by doping Y 2 O 3 via a sol\u2013gel process. Niu et al. [3] also reported that the material mixed with rare earth oxides through a sol\u2013gel method in citric acid system presented high gas sensitivity to gasoline. The hydrous solution methods have been widely adopted to prepare \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanopowders for many years [5\u20137] . However, the sensing particles obtained via such preparation methods often contain inorganic ions such as Na + and Cl \u2212 , which can not be completely washed away by deionized water or organic solvents, and then influence materials properties. To solve this problem, an anhydrous solvent method has been developed to synthesize \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanopowders in recent years [8\u201310] . For example, Hyeon et al. [8] successfully fabricated crystalline and monodispersed \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles with a particle size of about 13 nm by direct oxidation of iron pentacarbonyl with trimethylamine oxide as an oxidant in the presence of oleic acid. Jing and Wu [9] also synthesized acicular \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles with a particle size of around 10 nm by using lauric acid as an anhydrous medium. It is noted that until now most of the researches on the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanopowders obtained by anhydrous solvent method have been focused mainly on their magnetic behavior, while their gas sensing properties have not been reported yet. In this paper, pure and Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanopowders have been fabricated by using lauryl alcohol as an anhydrous medium and their gas sensing characteristics have been investigated in detail. 2 Experimental All the reagents were of analytical grade and used as purchased. Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 powders were prepared by an anhydrous solvent method as follows. Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O and Cd(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b74H 2 O were added into a given amount of lauryl alcohol. The molar ratio of Cd to Fe varied from 1 to 21, while the molar ratio of lauryl alcohol to iron nitrate was kept constant at 1:2. The mixture was heated in a beaker at 120 \u00b0C while intensively stirring until the evolution of brown gas (N 2 O 5 ) ceased. A sticky moist red\u2013brown mass was obtained and washed repeatedly with ethanol, then dried at 80 \u00b0C for 4 h. The as-prepared product was designated as FeOOH (Cd). Subsequently, the FeOOH (Cd) was subjected to 1h heat treatment at 300 \u00b0C in a muffle furnace, and then milled to fine \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 powders with a different additive amount of Cd. Pure FeOOH and \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 powders were also prepared in the same way. Thermal analyses of the as-prepared FeOOH (Cd) were carried out with a ZRY-2P thermal analyzer by heating a 10 mg sample from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C in air at a heating rate of 10 K min \u22121 . XRD spectra of the samples were performed with a Japan Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The particle size of the sample was determined with a Holland Philips T200ST transmission electron microscopy. The \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 powder obtained was mixed with terpineol to form a paste, and then the paste was coated onto the outside surface of an Al 2 O 3 tube on which two platinum wires had been installed at each end. The Al 2 O 3 tube was about 8 mm in length, 2 mm in external diameter and 1.6 mm in internal diameter. A small Ni\u2013Cr alloy coil was placed through the tube to heat the sensing material at temperatures from 100 to 500 \u00b0C. The operating temperature was controlled by adjusting the heating power. In order to improve their stability and repeatability, the gas sensing materials were sintered at 300 \u00b0C for 10 days in air, and then tested in a glass chamber with a volume of 15 l. Gas sensitivity of the side-heated gas sensors was measured under a steady-state condition. The schematic representation and the measuring principle of the gas sensor are the same as the previous literature [3] . In the gas sensitivity measurement, a given amount of sample gases were injected into a closed chamber by a microinjector and mixed by a fan for 20 s (liquids were firstly evaporated and then mixed by a fan for 20 s). The gas response S is defined as the ratio R a / R g , where R a is the resistance measured in air and R g is that measured in a test gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization Fig. 1 shows the TG-DTA curves of FeOOH (5% Cd) (doped with 5 mol% Cd addition). Two weight losses were observed between 30 and 290 \u00b0C, the total weight loss being about 34.6%. The first weight loss occurred at 30\u2013180 \u00b0C is ascribable to desorption of water and ethanol physically adsorbed on the oxide surface. The second weight loss at 180\u2013290 \u00b0C is considered to arise from decomposition of the residual lauryl alcohol and further desorption of the water and ethanol. The endothermic peak in the DTA curve corresponds to the desorption of the water and ethanol, while two consecutive exothermic peaks between 180\u2013240 and 240\u2013290 \u00b0C to the decomposition of the residual organic matter and the phase transformation from amorphous FeOOH (5% Cd) to crystalline \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 phase. On the basis of the TG-DTA results, we selected 300 \u00b0C as the calcination temperature of FeOOH (5% Cd) to obtain final \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) nanopowder. TG-DTA curves of the undoped FeOOH demonstrated similar trends (not shown herein). XRD patterns of \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) and undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 are shown in Fig. 2 a and b , respectively. The diffraction pattern of \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) was similar to that of undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 and matched well with the standard \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 reflections (JCPDS No. 39-1346). No phase containing Cd additive was observed due to the detection limit of the apparatus. The rather broaden peaks suggest that the particle sizes of the samples are very small. The mean crystalline size, calculated by the Debye\u2013Scherrer equation, was about 10 nm for the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) and about 7 nm for the undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 . TEM photographs of \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) are shown in Fig. 3 . In Fig. 3 a, the rod-like products of >80 nm length and about 10 nm width are observed, and some of them aggregate into bundles. The shape of the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) tended to alter from fiber to rod in comparison with the TEM image of undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (not shown herein). The nanostructure of the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 (5% Cd) is further confirmed by HRTEM observation. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the clear fringe spacing (0.481 nm) was very close to the space between (1 1 1) lattice planes, implying the high crystallinity of the sample. 3.2 Gas sensing properties It is well known that the gas sensitivity is greatly influenced by operating temperature and the amount of additives. In order to determine the optimum operating temperature and the additive amount, responses of the undoped and various Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to 1000 ppm C 2 H 5 OH in air were examined as a function of operating temperature. From Fig. 4 , it can be seen that the response to C 2 H 5 OH varied with not only the amount of the added Cd but also the operating temperature, and each curve revealed a maximum at an optimum operating temperature. Among the sensors tested, the sensor with 5 mol% Cd exhibited the largest response to C 2 H 5 OH at 270 \u00b0C. On the other hand, the undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensor exhibited the highest response to C 2 H 5 OH at 240 \u00b0C. The reason why the operating temperature of 5 mol% Cd-doped sensor is higher than that of the undoped may be attributed to the presence of Cd. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between gas response and gas concentration for the 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensor at 270 \u00b0C and for the undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensor at 240 \u00b0C. The undoped and 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors exhibited large response to acetone and ethanol, moderate response to petrol, but small response to LPG, H 2 and CO. Also, the gas response of the two sensors to acetone and ethanol increased with increasing the gas concentration. The concentration dependences presented a good linearity basically, suggesting that they can meet the application demand. In particular, it should be pointed out that the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors generally had good sensitivity to LPG when the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanopowders were synthesized by a hydrous solution method [5\u20137] . In the present work, however the \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors (both doped and undoped) were almost insensitive to LPG, undoubtedly due to the different preparation method. This could be an advantage of our sensors because they can effectively eliminate the interference from LPG when detecting other gases. Gas responses of the undoped and 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to various 1000 ppm gases are compared in Fig. 6 . The responses of the 5 mol% Cd-doped sensor to acetone and C 2 H 5 OH are slight higher than that of the undoped one, but both exhibited approximately equivalent responses to petrol, LPG, H 2 and CO at their optimum operating temperature, indicating that the sensitivity and selectivity to acetone and ethanol were enhanced by the 5 mol% Cd addition. This result is in agreement with the reports in which suitably Cd-doped sensors can improve sensitivity to ethanol or other gases [11,12] . Response and recovery times are the important parameters of gas sensor, which are defined as the times to reach 90% of the final signal. Fig. 7 shows the response-recovery characteristics of the two sensors. As seen from Fig. 7 , after introducing 1000 ppm acetone, the response of the two sensors appeared immediately. The response times for the undoped and 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors were 20 and 4 s, and the recovery times were 100 and 5 s, respectively. The stability of the 5 mol% Cd-doped and the undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors were measured at a level of 1000 ppm acetone after aged for 90 days. The results are shown in Fig. 8 , from which it is seen that the two sensors presented nearly constant responses to acetone, and the 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensor possessed better stability than that of the undoped one. 4 Conclusions Nanocrystalline undoped and Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 powders were successfully synthesized by an anhydrous solvent method using lauryl alcohol as an anhydrous medium, and the gas sensing properties of these nanopowders were investigated. From the results, some conclusions can be drawn as follows: 1. Both undoped and 5 mol% Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors showed large response to acetone and ethanol with a relatively good selectivity at 240 and 270 \u00b0C, respectively. 2. The 5 mol% Cd-doped sensor exhibited much shorter response and recovery time, better long-time stability, higher sensitivity and better selectivity to acetone and ethanol than the undoped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensor, although the operating temperature increased by 30 \u00b0C. 3. The present undoped and Cd-doped \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors obtained by an anhydrous solvent method were insensitive to LPG, while the reported \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 sensors prepared by hydrous solution methods generally were more or less sensitive to LPG, suggesting that the preparation method played an important role in determining the gas-sensing properties of the materials.

        "title": "Characterization and gas sensitivity study of polyaniline/SnO2 hybrid material prepared by hydrothermal route",
        "abstract": "A polyaniline (PAni)/SnO 2 hybrid material was prepared by a hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The XRD pattern suggested that PAni did not modify the crystal structure of SnO 2 , but SnO 2 affected the crystallization of PAni to some extent. The gas sensitivity of the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid was also studied to ethanol and acetone at operation temperatures of 30, 60 and 90 \u00b0C. It was found that the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material had gas sensitivity only when operated at 60 and 90 \u00b0C, and it showed a linear relationship between the responses and the concentrations of ethanol and acetone at 90 \u00b0C. The sensing mechanism was also discussed. Keywords Gas sensitivity Polyaniline SnO 2 Hydrothermal route 1 Introduction At present, gas sensing materials can be classed mainly into two kinds: organic and inorganic materials. The requirements for useful gas sensing devices in a variety of applications are high sensitivity, fast response and recovery time, low cost and portability. Whilst the gas sensing devices based on inorganic materials are sensitive to a variety of organic species at low levels, the need for elevated operation temperatures increases power consumption, reduces sensor life and limits the portability. Doped or undoped SnO 2 is most studied and used among the inorganic materials, but its operation temperature is about 250\u2013450 \u00b0C [1,2] . The gas sensing devices based on organic materials, such as polypyrrole, polyaniline and metalphthalocyanines, have gas sensitivity at room temperature, but their long response time [3,4] due to the orderly structure limits their usage. It has been reported that organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials can synergize or complement the properties of the pure organic or inorganic materials in electronics, optics, coating, catalysis and so on [5\u20138] . Recently the study of organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials for gas sensor application has proved that the hybridization improves the properties of pure organic and inorganic materials. Suri et al. [9] studied gas sensitivity of polypyrrole/iron oxide to CO 2 , N 2 and CH 4 , and found that it had the highest sensitivity to CO 2 gas. Nardis et al. [10] reported that cobalt porphyrin/tin dioxide had superior selectivity to methanol vapor and lower working temperature than pure SnO 2 . Hosono et al. [11] and Matsubara et al. [12] synthesized PPy/MoO 3 thin films and PPy/MoO 3 pressed pellets and found that the PPy/MoO 3 materials had better selectivity to polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In addition, Armes and Maeda [13] and Partch et al. [14] reported that this kind of hybrid materials possessed small grain size and high stability in air. Previously, our group reported the gas sensitivity of polypyrrole (PPy)/SnO 2 and PPy/Fe 2 O 3 hybrid materials to toxic gases, such as NH 3 , H 2 S and NO x [15,16] . VOCs are also toxic; they can cause sick house syndrome, and are inflammable and explosive. In this paper, a PAni/SnO 2 hybrid was prepared via a hydrothermal route in which PAni was polymerized in situ, and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution electron microscope (HRTEM). The gas sensitivity study of the PAni/SnO 2 material was carried out to ethanol and acetone at low operation temperatures. The sensing mechanism of the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material was also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation and characterization of PAni/SnO 2 Aniline (purchased, analytical purity) was distilled under reduced pressure before use. Ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS, (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 ), HCl (38%) and SnO 2 were all of analytical purity and used without further purification. Few drops of aniline were added to 50 mL water in which the concentration of H + was adjusted to about 1 mol/L by HCl. The solution was ultrasonically treated for 30 min and then a specific mass of SnO 2 (the mass ratio of aniline to SnO 2 was 3:97) was added to it. The mixture was stirred and ultrasonically treated for 30 min each, then transferred to a Teflon autoclave, followed by the addition of APS at a molar ratio to aniline of 1:1. The autoclave was sealed and kept at 140 \u00b0C for 4 h. When cooled to room temperature, the mixture was filtered. The precipitates were washed by deionized water, ethanol and acetone for several times, and then dried at 60 \u00b0C in an oven. The crystal structure of the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material was examined by XRD (DMAX-2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA). The surface morphology was analyzed with the help of SEM (X-650, Japan, operated at 25 kV) and HRTEM (Philips T20ST, operated at 200 kV). FT-IR spectrum was recorded on an Avatar 380 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. 2.2 Gas sensing characteristics measurement The gas sensitivity of PAni/SnO 2 to ethanol and acetone was measured as described in ref. [17] . The sample was fabricated on an aluminum tube with Au electrodes and platinum wires. A Ni\u2013Cr alloy wire through the tube was used as a heating filament. The volume of the testing chamber was 15 L, and a fan was used to make the test gas atmosphere homogeneous. The gas sensing test was carried out at a fixed humidity of 60% and the operation temperatures were 30, 60 and 90 \u00b0C. Fig. 1 depicts the measuring electric circuit in this experiment. V c is a circuit voltage, V out a measured voltage, V h a heating voltage and R L is the resistance of a loading resistor. The voltage across the sensor can be determined indirectly by measuring the V out . The response\u2013recovery curves of the sensor, the curves of the measured voltage versus time, were recorded by a computer. The response ( S ) was defined as the ratio V (out)g / V (out)a , where V (out)a is the initial voltage of the sensor and V (out)g the voltage of the sensor when exposed to testing gases. The response or recovery time is the time for the voltage change to reach 90% of the total change from V (out)g to V (out)a or vice versa. 3 Results and discussions Fig. 2 shows the FT-IR spectrum of the obtained PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material, in comparison with pure PAni, in the range of 400\u20134000 cm \u22121 . The pure PAni was prepared by chemical oxidation in an aqueous solution at room temperature. The acidity of the solvent was adjusted to about 1 mol/L by HCl. APS was used as an oxidant and its molar ratio to aniline was 1:1. The reaction equation was . PAni exhibit characteristic bands at 1504, 1300, 1143 and 796 cm \u22121 [18,19] , which are the C C stretching band in benzenoid rings, the C N stretching mode in Ar N, the vibration band of the dopant anion (HCl-PAni), and the C H bending vibration out of the plane of the para -disubstituted benzene rings, respectively. These characteristic peaks can also be seen in the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material, except that 796 cm \u22121 is overlapped by the stretching band of Sn O appeared at about 660 cm \u22121 . X-ray diffraction patterns of SnO 2 (purchased, A.P., the particle size was about 15 nm), PAni and PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material has the same profile as pure SnO 2 , indicating that the crystal structure of SnO 2 is not modified by PAni. Pure PAni has similarly strong peaks at 2 \u03b8 , 20.44\u00b0 (1 0 0 face) and 2 \u03b8 , 25.10\u00b0 (1 1 0 face) which were not observed in the XRD pattern of PAni/SnO 2 , indicating that SnO 2 nanoparticles hamper the crystallization of PAni. This is consistent with the reports of Xia and Wang [20] and He [21] . Fig. 4 shows the SEM image of the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the amorphous and spherical particles are uniformly dispersed, where the amorphous particles are PAni and the spherical particles are SnO 2 and PAni/SnO 2 hybrid. Excessively irregular PAni particles can be reduced by sufficient ultrasonic treatment and stirring [22] . In order to examine the structure of PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material clearly, HRTEM was carried out ( Fig. 5 ). From Fig. 5 , we can see that some of the spherical particles with clear boundaries and crystal line are bared SnO 2 , and other spherical particles with blurry boundaries are SnO 2 enwrapped by PAni. In the gas sensing study, we found that the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material had no gas sensitivity to ethanol or acetone when operated at 30 \u00b0C. But, when operated at 60 or 90 \u00b0C, it was sensitive to low concentration of ethanol and acetone. Figs. 6 and 7 show the response\u2013recovery curves of PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material to ethanol and acetone of different concentrations. From Figs. 6 and 7 , we can see that the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material has good reversibility when exposed to ethanol or acetone, and it has faster response time when operated at 90 \u00b0C than at 60 \u00b0C, and the measurement voltage levels off quickly after exposure to ethanol or acetone. The response time to ethanol and acetone was within 23\u201343 and 16\u201320 s, respectively, at 90 \u00b0C, and the recovery time was within 16\u201328 and 35\u201348 s, respectively. Fig. 8 a and b show the relationship between the responses to ethanol and acetone of PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material and the concentration of vapors, respectively. It can be seen that the responses to ethanol and acetone of PAni/SnO 2 increased linearly with the increasing concentrations. PAni is a p-type semiconductor, and SnO 2 an n-type, so that there are two competitive mechanisms of electronic properties in the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material. When exposed to ethanol or acetone, PAni/SnO 2 exhibits the properties of n-type semiconductors; that is, the resistance of n-type semiconductors decreases when exposed to reducing gases. It suggests that the sensing mechanism of PAni/SnO 2 is governed by SnO 2 . This maybe caused by the fact that SnO 2 presents at a high level in PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material. The PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material is gas-sensitive at operating temperatures (60 and 90 \u00b0C) much lower than those of SnO 2 (about 250\u2013450 \u00b0C). This can be explained that the positively charged depletion layer on the surface of the SnO 2 could be formed owing to inter-particle electron migration from SnO 2 to PAni at the p\u2013n heterojunctions, lowering the activation energy and enthalpy of physisorption for vapors with good electron-donating characteristics [23] . 4 Conclusions An organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material PAni/SnO 2 was prepared by a hydrothermal method and studied for gas sensing of ethanol and acetone. The PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material was sensitive to ethanol and acetone when operated at 60 or 90 \u00b0C and showed good reversibility. The sensing mechanism was suggested to be related to the existence of p\u2013n heterojunctions in the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material. When operated at 90 \u00b0C, the PAni/SnO 2 hybrid material exhibited short response and recovery time (within 1 min). The material developed can overcome the shortcomings of long response time of PAni and the high operation temperature of SnO 2 , thus presenting very important features for practical use.

In the complex (2), there are two units [ZnLCl2] (a), and [ZnL2Cl]+ (b), which have a distorted tetrahedral geometry and a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry, respectively.\n In these complexes, significant multiple inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions are shown.\n These contacts lead to aggregation and supramolecular assembly of complexes (1) and (2) into 3D and 2D frameworks, respectively. Fluorescent analysis in the dilute DMF solution and solid state shows that both\n complexes exhibit intense emission in blue region. They display high blue luminescence quantum efficiency due to a metal-to-ligand\n charge transfer (MLCT) and have a bathochromic shift of the emission energy compared with the free ligand L. The emission\n intensity of complex (2) is higher than that of complex (1).",

        "abstract": "Porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 was synthesized by simple calcination of a \u03b2-FeOOH precursor derived from a facile hydrothermal method. In the hydrothermal process, only FeCl36H2O was used as the source material and no templates or pore-directing agents were needed. The as-prepared porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 was further employed as a support for loading Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Due to the advantages of porous nanostructures (large surface area and facile gas diffusion) and the catalytic capability of AuNPs, the derived AuNP-supported porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 was further investigated for gas sensor applications using ethanol as a probe molecule. Obtained results showed that the AuNP-supported porous \u03b1-Fe2O3 exhibited a much higher response in comparison to pure \u03b1-Fe2O3. The enhanced sensor properties are attributed to the unique porous structures of the \u03b1-Fe2O3 support and active AuNPs for promoting sensing reactions, as well as the synergic electronic interaction between Au and \u03b1-Fe2O3. It is expected that noble metals such as Ag, Pt and Pd can also be supported on other porous metal oxide semiconductors to explore superior properties of functional nanomaterials. \u00a9 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, XPS, AES and H2-TPR techniques. The Cu/CeO2 catalyst prepared via SMAI exhibits higher catalytic activity in CO oxidation than that prepared via CI with the same Cu content due to the smaller Cu particles. The CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared via SMAI also shows higher catalytic activity than that prepared via CI because the CuO particles of the former are smaller than the latter and can be reduced by CO more easily. The Cu/CeO2 catalysts display higher catalytic activities than CuO/CeO2 catalysts with the same Cu content and prepared by the same method. The TPR profile for CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared via SMAI has a single peak, indicating a one-step reduction, whereas the TPR profile for CuO/CeO2 catalyst prepared via CI has two peaks, indicating a two-step reduction due to the existence of two kinds of CuO species.",

        "abstract": "Two kinds of various morphological \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles modified by anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl-sulfonate, SDS) and cationic surfactant (hexadecyipyridinium chloride, HPC), respectively, have been synthesized via hydrothermal method, using simple inorganic salt (NH 4)3Fe(C2O4)3 and alkali NaOH as starting precursors. Meanwhile, \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles without surfactant are also fabricated under the same conditions for comparison. The resultant products were characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron micrograph (TEM) combined with electron diffraction (ED) and magnetization measurements. It is interesting that the obtained \u03b1-Fe 2O3 nanoparticles without surfactant are polyhedral with average particle size of 90\u00b135 nm; while the obtained \u03b1-Fe 2O3 nanoparticles modified by SDS are ellipsoidal with mean particle size of major axis: ca. 420 nm; minor axis: ca. 205 nm and those modified by HPC are spherical with mean particle size of ca. 185 nm observed from TEM. In addition, magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal that the \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles modified by two surfactants show enhancement in coercivity (Hc) and the remanent magnetization (Mr) compared with those of the obtained \u03b1-Fe2O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant at room temperature. The experimental results suggest that the surfactants not only significantly influence the size and shape of the particles, but also their magnetic properties. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The as-synthesized products were characterized by techniques of XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption. Structural characterization indicated that as-prepared ceria hollow microspheres (150 nm in diameter) possess porous structure (average pore diameter of 6.5 nm), high surface area (144.1 m 2 /g), large pore volume (0.23 cm 3 g \u22121 ) and thin shell (16 nm in thickness) composed of small nanoparticles (mean particle diameter of 4.9 nm). It is expected that as-prepared ceria hollow microspheres have potential applications in several fields as catalysts, catalyst supports, chemical sensors, storage hydrogen devices and optical or electrical materials. A possible mechanism for the formation of ceria hollow spheres was discussed in detail. Keywords Ceria Porous Hollow microspheres Synthesis Characterization 1 Introduction Ceria is one of the most widely used rare earth metal oxides due to its oxygen storage capacity (OSC), oxygen deficiency, and electronic conductivity [1] . Ceria presents a wide range of application in heterogeneous catalysis, such as three-way catalysts for automobile exhaust gas emission control, removal of SO x \u2013NO x from fluid catalytic cracking flue gases, electrocatalysts over fuel cell electrodes, and catalysts for various oxidation and hydrogenation reactions [2,3] . Moreover, ceria has also attracted intense interest in electrochemistry and optics [4,5] . It is well known that the morphology and microstructure have a strong influence on the performance of ceria. In recent years, ceria with different morphologies and microstructures has been synthesized, including nanoparticles [3,6\u20138] , nanowires [9] , nanofibers [10,11] , nanotubes [12\u201314] , nanorods [15] , nanocubes [16,17] , solid spheres [18,19] , and hollow spheres [20\u201322] . Among various nanomaterials, the hollow microspheres with nanometer to micrometer dimensions are of increasing interest in a number of applications, such as catalysts, catalyst supports, light fillers, pigments, shape-selective adsorbents, chemical sensors, artificial cells, chemical reactors and drug-delivery carriers, due to their low density, large specific surface area, stability, good surface permeability and distinct optical property [23,24] . Kordas et al. [20] synthesized hollow ceria nanospheres using polystyrene latex spheres as template. Zhang et al. [21] synthesized single/multiwall hollow CeO 2 microspheres with 70 nm in shell thickness by hydrothermal method. Titirici et al. [22] synthesized CeO 2 hollow spheres via a hydrothermal approach with around 100 nm in shell thickness. Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to synthesize thin shell hollow spheres. Template method has usually been used to prepare various hollow microspheres, including polymers, metal oxides and metals. Some recent research has indicated that using carbon microspheres as a template to synthesize hollow microspheres is a simple but efficient approach [25\u201328] . As a novel green template, in comparison with polymer or silica microspheres, carbon microspheres have one apparent feature: there are a number of hydroyl groups (\u2013OH) on the surface, which makes surface modification unnecessary [25\u201328] . Herein, we developed a simple and efficient template approach to fabricate ceria thin shell hollow microspheres using carbon microspheres as templates and the ceria hollow microspheres were characterized through XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption. 2 Experimental All chemicals in this work were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Glucose, DMF and ethanol were purchased from Tianjin Zhihua Chemical Company and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Company. 2.1 Preparation of carbon microspheres Carbon microspheres were prepared in a typical procedure [27,29] . About 7.2 g of glucose was dissolved in 80 ml distilled water to get a clear solution and then hydrothermal treatment at 160 \u00b0C for 6 h. The precipitate was centrifuge-rinsed at 4000 r/min with distilled water and ethanol for several times till getting the clear solution, and then dried at 80 \u00b0C in air for 12 h. 2.2 Preparation of ceria hollow microspheres The synthesis process of ceria hollow microspheres was as follows: 0.5087 g carbon microspheres were uniformly dispersed in 200 ml N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) by ultrasonication for 1 h. 0.1796 g Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O dissolved in 20 ml DMF was slowly dropped into the above mixture and then 2 ml of distilled water were added, followed by ultrasonicating for 1 h. The mixed solution was aged under ambient temperature for 24 h. The resulting precursor was centrifugated and washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 80 \u00b0C in air for 13.5 h. After calcined at 450 \u00b0C in air for 3 h. 2.3 Sample characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer, with Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA in a scanning range of 3\u201380\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ), and the scanning rate and step are 8\u00b0/min and 0.02\u00b0, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the crystalline phase were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Date File. X\u2013ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with the Al K\u03b1 X-ray source ( hv = 1486.6 eV), hybrid (magnetic/electrostatic) optics and a multi-channel plate and delay line detector (DLD). In order to subtract the surface charging effect, the C1s peak has been fixed, in agreement with the literature, at a binding energy of 284.6 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Shimadzu SS-550, 15 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Philips FEI Tecnai 20ST, 200 kV) were carried out to observe the morphologies of the sample. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. The specific surface area ( S BET ) of the sample was calculated following the multi-point BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller) procedure. The pore-size distribution was determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherms using the BJH (Barett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda) method. 3 Results and discussion A possible mechanism of the formation of ceria hollow microspheres is described in Scheme 1 . Firstly, because there are plenty of hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) on the surface of the carbon microspheres, Ce 3+ cations can be absorbed onto the surface and bind to the surface hydroxyl groups. Secondly, Ce 3+ hydrolyzed to form gelatinous hydrous cerium hydroxide (Ce(OH) 3 \u00b7 x H 2 O) on the surface of the carbon microspheres [30] , the presence of small amount water can promote the hydrolysis reaction, forming a core-shell structure. Followed by a calcination process in air, Ce 3+ was oxidized to Ce 4+ and the carbon microspheres were removed in the form of carbon dioxide which departed from the core through the shell, resulting in the formation of hollow microspheres along with a number of pores on the shell [27] . Fig. 1 shows the TGA of the carbon/ceria microspheres. It can be seen that there are two obvious weight losses. The first weight loss is centered at 50 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the desorption of physically adsorbed water; the second large weight loss is centered at 400 \u00b0C, which corresponds to the removal of core carbon microspheres. Hence, the as-prepared carbon/ceria microspheres were calcined at 450 \u00b0C to obtain ceria hollow microspheres. XRD was used to identify the crystal structure of the sample. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared product. It is clear that all the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern are corresponding to a cubic fluorite structure of ceria, in good agreement with literature values [31] , and size-broadening of the diffraction peaks can be observed. No characteristic diffraction peaks from other Ce species can be detected in the sample. The mean crystallite size is 4.9 nm, estimated using Scherrer\u2019s equation from (220) diffraction peak of ceria. Scherrer\u2019s equation is: D = 0.89 \u03bb / \u03b2 cos \u03b8 where D is the crystal size; \u03bb is the wavelength of X-ray radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm for Cu K\u03b1 radiation); \u03b2 is the full width at half-maximum for the diffraction peak [rad] considered, and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle [\u00b0] at which the peak appears. SEM analyses were performed to examine the morphology of the sample. Fig. 3 a showed the SEM micrograph of the carbon microspheres produced via the hydrothermal treatment of glucose water solution. It can be observed that the carbon particles possess smooth and spherical morphology with the diameter of around 480 nm. Fig. 3 b shows the SEM images of as-prepared ceria hollow microspheres. As shown, SEM overview observation reveals that as-prepared ceria products consist of spherical microstructures with the diameter of around 150 nm. The outer surfaces of the microspheres are rough, indicating that they are composed of a large number of loosely packed nanoparticles. Close observation reveals that there is partial cave-in on the surface of some microspheres, indicating the hollow core of the sample and thin shell wall. To further investigate the structure of ceria hollow microspheres, the sample was characterized by TEM. Fig. 4 a\u2013d display the TEM images of the hollow microspheres. The strong contrast between the dark edges and pale centers in these images confirms the hollow structure of the ceria microspheres, with thin shell about 16 nm thick. It can also be clearly observed that the shell is composed of a large number of very small nanoparticles and constitutes a porous framework. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ( Fig. 4 e) of ceria hollow microspheres further reveals that the hollow microspheres are composed of ceria polycrystallites. The ceria spheres were investigated by XPS to study the surface compositions. As seen in Fig. 5 a, the general XPS survey scan shows that no peaks of other elements except C, Ce and O were observed in the picture, indicating that the product consists of Ce and O. The calculated atomic ratio of O and Ce by XPS is about 6.3, which is three times higher than that (2) in CeO 2 , suggesting that as-prepared ceria hollow microspheres possess a large amount of oxygen deficiency, which is advantageous for the oxygen adsorption of the material [12,32\u201334] . The high-resolution XPS of Ce3d is shown in Fig. 5 b. The Ce3d spectrum cle is in good agreement with that of the pure CeO 2 . The peaks at around 883, 889, and 898 eV were assigned to Ce3d 5/2 for Ce 4+ state. The peaks at around 901, 908, and 917 eV were assigned to Ce3d 3/2 for Ce 4+ state [35,36] . The surface area and porosity of the ceria hollow microspheres were investigated by means of Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis and nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm. Because the ceria hollow microspheres are composed of a large number of nanoparticles, a high surface area can be expected, which is proven by BET analysis. The BET specific surface area is 144.1 m 2 /g. Fig. 6 a and b show the N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore-size distribution of ceria hollow microspheres, respectively. A distinct hysteresis loop can be observed between adsorption and desorption branch, indicating porous structure of ceria hollow microspheres. The plot of the pore-size distribution reveals that the ceria hollow microspheres posses porous structures with a size distribution of 1\u201320 nm, the average pore diameter of the ceria is 6.5 nm, but most pores lie in near 2.5 nm, and the corresponding BJH desorption cumulative volume is 0.23 cm 3 g \u22121 . 4 Conclusions In conclusion, porous ceria hollow microspheres were synthesized through a simple and efficient carbon sphere template method. The samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption. Structural characterization indicates that as-prepared ceria hollow microspheres possess porous structure, high surface area, large pore volume and thin shell composed of small nanoparticles. It is expected that as-prepared ceria hollow microspheres have potential applications in several fields as catalysts, catalyst supports, chemical sensors, storage hydrogen devices and optical or electrical materials.

        "abstract": "Acicular shaped \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (major axis: 17\u00b12 nm; minor axis: 1.7\u00b11 nm) have been prepared using lauric acid as a non-aqueous medium. The products were investigated by IR, TG-DTA, XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and magnetization measurements. For the preparation of pure \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, the suitable condition of the molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate is set 2:1 and the appropriate temperature lies in the range 573\u2013673 K. Besides, either pure \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 or a mixture of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 and \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 can also be obtained with the change of the molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate. The experimental results indicate that the particle sizes, thermal stability and magnetic properties of the iron oxide strongly depend on the conditions in the preparation. Keywords \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 Lauric acid Non-aqueous medium Magnetic property 1 Introduction Over the past years, a lot of work has been done on the synthesis of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles due to their potential applications for ferrofluid, magnetic refrigeration, bioprocessing, information storage and gas sensitive materials [1\u20137] . Considerable researches have been performed till now mainly on the preparation of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles in aqueous solution [8\u201310] . However, these products prepared from aqueous solution contained some inorganic ions such as Na + and Cl \u2013 , which tend to be a major source of contamination of these particles [10] . Thus, non-aqueous solution approach has been employed to process \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles due to the resultant precipitates being not contaminated. Particularly, Hyeon and co-workers [11] have successfully fabricated highly crystalline and monodisperse \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles with a particle size of 13 nm by direct oxidation of iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of oleic acid with trimethylamine oxide as an oxidant. However, the synthesis of acicular \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, using lauric acid as a non-aqueous medium and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O as starting precursor, has not been reported yet. In order to prepare pure \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles in a non-aqueous lauric acid medium, we present preliminary work in this paper, in which the suitable conditions have been found and detailed characterizations of the samples were done. In the preparation process, the precursors used are common and inexpensive compared with other methods. 2 Experimental All the reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. A homogeneous solution was produced by addition of calculated amount of iron nitrate non-anhydrate Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O to a given amount of molten lauric acid. The molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate was set at three different levels: 2:1 (S1), 1:1 (S2) and 1:2 (S3). The homogeneous solutions prepared with these compositions were heated separately in a beaker at 393 K with vigorous stirring till the evolution of brown gas (N 2 O 5 ). A sticky moist red-brown mass was formed and cooled down to room temperature in air, then treated with 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran to form brown precipitate which was collected by centrifugation and dried at 343 K in an air oven for 4 h. The yellow powders of the intermediate ferric oxide hydroxide (FeOOH) being essential to prepare \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles were obtained. IR spectra of the FeOOH and \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles in KBr pellets were recorded in the range 4000\u2013400 cm \u20131 on an American Nicolet AVATAR 380 FT-IR spectrometer. Thermal analyses were carried out on a ZRY-2P thermal analyzer by heating a 10 mg sample from room temperature to 973 K in air at a heating rate of 20 K min \u20131 . XRD spectra were performed on a Japan Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffraction with Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =1.5418 \u00c5). Raman spectra were collected in the range 4000\u2013400 cm \u20131 on a Germany BRUKER FT-RAMAN spectrometer. The surface morphology was analyzed on a Japan HITACHI S-3500N scanning electron microscope. The particle size of the samples was determined on a Holland Phillips EM400ST transmission electron microscope. Magnetic measurements were carried out on an American LDJ 9600 vibrating sample magnetometer with a maximum field of 7.0 kOe at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The representative IR spectra of sample S1 (a) and sample S1 annealed at 573 K for 1 h (b) were shown in Fig. 1 . As observed in Fig. 1a , the strong bands in the range 1700\u20131310 cm \u20131 could be assigned to the ionic nitrate (NO 3 \u2013 ) [12\u201313] , the 798 and 668 cm \u20131 peaks to the deformation vibration of Fe\u2013OH groups and 3450\u20133200 cm \u20131 band to the stretching vibration of Fe\u2013OH groups [14] . The small band near 2922 cm \u20131 was due to \u03bd s -CH 2 of residual lauric acid, suggesting the presence of FeOOH in the organic medium. However, in Fig. 1b , the peaks described above were disappeared and the characteristic IR spectra of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles appeared at 465, 585 and 632 cm \u20131 [1,2] , respectively. This phenomenon indicated that the residual lauric acid and nitro compounds had decomposed and the FeOOH phase had transformed into \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 completely after annealing at 573 K. It should be noted that the bands around 3430 and 1637 cm \u20131 in both samples were assigned to the stretching vibration of OH group and bending vibration of water molecules \u03b4 (HOH), respectively [15] . The IR spectra of samples S2 and S3 show similar trends, except that with the decrease of molar ratio of lauric acid to Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O, the characteristic peaks of nitro compounds and ionic nitrate turn stronger. The TG-DTA curves of sample S1 were shown in Fig. 2 . The TG curve presents one step of thermal decomposition between 423 and 553 K with a weight loss of about 24.3% and no further changes beyond 573 K were observed. This could be ascribed to the removal of water and the residual lauric acid. The DTA curve includes four main steps of thermal decomposition. The first step between 433 and 473 K is accompanied by an endothermal effect which is assigned to water desorbtion and the release of attached nitrogen compounds. The other three steps are accompanied by exothermal effects which are assigned to the combustion of lauric acid between 473 and 538 K, the crystallization of amorphous FeOOH particles along with partial \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 formation between 538 and 653 K, and the transformation of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 phase into more stable \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 particles in the range 773\u2013873 K, respectively. The TG-DTA curves of samples S2 ( Fig. 3 ) and S3 ( Fig. 4 ) presented similar trends except several slight differences. XRD patterns of samples S1, S2 and S3 annealed at different temperatures for 1 h were showed in Figs. 5 , 7 and 8, respectively. From Fig. 5 , the X-ray patterns can compare well with standard \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 reflections when heated at 573 K (a) and 673 K (b). In particular, the maghemite peak is slightly sharper in (a) than that in (b), and the average size of the samples shown in (a) and (b) calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peaks (using Scherrer's equation) are 8 and 13.8 nm, respectively. As expected, the average crystallite size of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles increased with the raise in annealing temperatures. When temperature rose up to 773 K, a small amount of \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 was detected and the phase was a mixture of maghemite ( \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 ) and hematite ( \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 ). Above 973 K, \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 would be completely transformed into \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 whose average size was 18 nm. Compared with standard Fe 3 O 4 and \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 XRD data, the two peaks at 2 \u03b8 angle of 35.5\u00b0 and 62.7\u00b0 could be attributed to either Fe 3 O 4 or \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 (311) and (440) peaks. In order to distinguish the Fe 3 O 4 and \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 , Raman spectra were further performed. As shown in Fig. 6 , Raman spectra for sample S1 annealed at 573 and 673 K for 1 h all showed two peaks, centered at the wavelength of around 1370 and 1580 cm \u20131 , respectively, which could be attributed to \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 phase. At the same time, the broadened peak over the wavelength 600\u2013800 cm \u20131 was also a characteristic band of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 [16] , which further confirms that the spinel phase is \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 , not Fe 3 O 4 . As observed from Fig. 7 , when heating sample S2 at 573 K (a), \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 crystalline peaks appeared, when temperature rose up to 673 K (b), two phases ( \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 and \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 ) were presented simultaneously, and above 773 K (c), the phase identification revealed the characteristic pattern of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 . As shown from Fig. 8 , when sample S3 was heated at 573 (a) and 673 K (b), the XRD pattern exhibits a mixture of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 and \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 . Above temperature 773 K (c), \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 would be transformed into \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 completely. The main reason for the presence of the mixture phase was that the residual Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O transformed into \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 directly when heated at 573 K, indicating that the molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate was unsuitable for preparation of pure \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 . The XRD results of samples S1, S2 and S3 annealed at different temperatures for 1 h were given in Table 1 . From Table 1 , it was clear that either pure \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 , or pure \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 , or a mixture of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 and \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 could be easily obtained by changing the annealing temperatures and molar ratio of iron nitrate to lauric acid. And sample S1 was the better selection to be used as magnetic materials due to its high crystallinity without any phase impurity. Hence, in this paper, we select sample S1 annealed at different temperatures for further characterization by SEM and TEM. The SEM pictures of sample S1 annealed at 673 and 973 K were shown in Figs. 9a and b , respectively. As seen from Fig. 9a , a lot of globular clusters along with acicular shape bars of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 are observed, indicating that the \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 particles are agglomerated. When the annealing temperature increases to 873 K, the surface of globular clusters becomes much rougher and the acicular shape bars become shorter evidently, suggesting that the morphology of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 and \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 is different from each other. The results would be further verified by following TEM studies. The TEM photographs of sample S1 annealed at 673 and 973 K were shown in Figs. 10a and b , respectively. In Fig. 10a , slender acicular shaped \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles are observed with major axis: 17\u00b12 nm; minor axis: 1.7\u00b11 nm. While in Fig. 10b , cylindrical shaped \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles are seen with major axis: 15\u00b11 nm; minor axis: 3.5\u00b11 nm. It is known that acicular shaped \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles possess better magnetic property [1] . So only the magnetic characterization has been done with the acicular shaped \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 , in which sample S1 annealed at 573 and 673 K temperature was done at room temperature and the hysteresis loops were made with a field scan of\u00b17.0 kOe. The results were shown in Figs. 11a and b . From Figs. 11a and b , for sample S1 annealed at 573 K, the saturation magnetization ( M s ), remnant magnetization ( M r ), coercivity ( H c ), and squareness ( M r / M s ) were determined to be 27.99, 0.5753 emu/g, 11.08 Oe, and 0.021, respectively; while for sample S1 annealed at 673 K, the corresponding values were determined to be 47.68, 4.023 emu/g, 45.33 Oe, and 0.084, respectively. It is obviously that the corresponding values of the former are lower than those of the latter due to its smaller particles. However, the saturation magnetization of the \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles obtained is much lower than that of the bulk \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 (76 emu/g) [17] , which probably could be attributed to the nanoscale dimension and the surface effects [18] . In addition, whether there are other factors that could influence the saturation magnetization of these particles is still an open question yet. 4 Conclusions In this work, acicular shaped \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (major axis: 17\u00b12 nm; minor axis: 1.7\u00b11 nm) have been prepared using lauric acid as a non-aqueous medium and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O as starting precursor. To prepare acicular shaped pure \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles in the non-aqueous medium, the suitable molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate is set 2:1 and the appropriate temperature is in the range of 573\u2013673 K. In addition, it is shown by XRD analysis that either pure \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 or a mixture of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 and \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles can also be easily obtained by changing the annealing temperatures and molar ratio of iron nitrate to lauric acid for various needs. The smaller dimension and better stability are caused by lauric acid, which hinders the increasing of the dimension and favors the formation of \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Hence, we postulate that it would be a promising technique for preparation of nanoscale metal oxides in non-aqueous systems using lauric acid as medium. It should be pointed out that the reason, why the saturation magnetization of the obtained \u03b3 -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles is lower compared with other methods, is still under way. References [1] V.

The products were investigated by IR, TG-DTA, XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and magnetization measurements. For the preparation of pure \u03b3-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, the suitable condition of the molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate is set 2:1 and the appropriate temperature lies in the range 573-673K. Besides, either pure \u03b1-Fe2O3 or a mixture of \u03b3-Fe 2O3 and \u03b1-Fe2O3 can also be obtained with the change of the molar ratio of lauric acid to iron nitrate. The experimental results indicate that the particle sizes, thermal stability and magnetic properties of the iron oxide strongly depend on the conditions in the preparation. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The turnover frequency (TOF) of CO on Co/La-SiO2 sample was higher than that on Co/SiO2 sample in F-T reaction (CO hydrogenation), which was probably due to the fact that the cobalt particle size in Co/La-SiO2 sample was much smaller than that in Co/SiO2 sample.

The structures of the Ce x Zr1-x O2 samples were confirmed by XRD analyses and FT-Raman results. The H2-TPR profiles for these catalysts had three peaks, which could be attributed to the reduction of three kinds of CuO species, i.e., the highly dispersed CuO, the larger CuO species and the bulk CuO.

Keywords Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts Gold particle CO oxidation Catalytic activity 1 Introduction Cerium dioxide containing materials have been the subject of numerous investigations in recent years. Ceria is an interesting oxide in the three-way catalysts (TWCs) used for eliminating toxic gases in automobile exhaust. The success of ceria is mainly due to the enhancement of the metal dispersion, the application in the water\u2013gas shift reaction and the oxygen storage capacity provided by the redox couple Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ [1\u20133] . Despite of its widespread applications, the use of pure cerium dioxide is highly discouraged because of its poor thermal stability [4,5] . To solve this problem, one way is to associate ceria to other elements for obtaining solid solutions with improved thermal properties. Many studies have focused on the zirconia\u2013ceria solid solutions [5\u20138] . Because of their high OSC, redox property, thermal resistance and better catalytic activity at lower temperatures, the zirconia\u2013ceria has been applied widely as a component of TWCs for the treatment of automotive exhaust gases. Precious metals are well-known oxidation catalysts with high activity and widely used for CO oxidation reaction. Pt, Pd, Rh, Au loaded catalysts have been reported by many investigations [9\u201312] . However, few literatures have reported the study of Au supported on ceria-zirconia as catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. The present paper reported the study of the catalysts Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 on the catalytic performance for CO oxidation. The support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 was prepared via a hydrothermal route and the Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts were synthesized by a deposition-precipitation method. The samples were characterized by XRD, FT-Raman, HRTEM, XPS and TPR techniques. The catalytic activities of the catalysts were evaluated by using a microreactor-GC system. The influence of the pH values, Au contents, calcination temperature and calcination time on the catalytic property for low-temperature CO oxidation is discussed in this paper. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of support and catalyst The support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 was prepared via a hydrothermal route by using Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O, Zr(NO 3 ) 4 \u00b75H 2 O as precursors. 2.78 g Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O and 0.69 g Zr(NO 3 ) 4 \u00b75H 2 O were dissolved into 80 ml distilled water in a Teflon bottle with an inner volume of 100 ml. A transparent solution was obtained under vigorous stirring. Then 0.96 g urea (CO(NH 2 ) 2 ) was slowly added into the above solution. The addition was carried out under agitation in order to keep the local concentration homogeneous. While stirring for about 1 h, the Teflon bottle was put in a stainless-steel autoclave and sealed tightly. Then it was put in an oven and the hydrothermal treatment at temperature of 160 \u00b0C for 24 h was performed. After the hydrothermal treatment, white precipitates were formed. The precipitates were separated by centrifuging and washed with deionized water several times. They were dried at 80 \u00b0C overnight in the oven and then calcined at 500 \u00b0C in the muffle furnace for 4 h; yellow powder was obtained. The Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts were prepared via a deposition-precipitation method. 0.3 g Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 support was slurred in 10 ml distilled water. 0.39 g HAuCl 4 \u00b74H 2 O was dissolved into 38 ml distilled water to form HAuCl 4 solution (0.21 mol/ml). Then calculated volume HAuCl 4 solution was slowly added into the support by separating funnel under vigorous stirring. At the same time, the pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O (0.1 M) and kept stirring for about 1 h. The above solution was centrifuged, and washed with deionized water until chloride ions cannot be detected using AgNO 3 solution. The production was dried at 70 \u00b0C overnight in the oven and then calcined at 300 \u00b0C in a muffle furnace for 3 h. For comparative study, a series of samples were also prepared at different pH value and calcined at different temperature and time. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) was performed with a Philips T20ST transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were operated by using a DMAX-2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The working voltage and current of the X-ray tube were 40 kV and 100 mA. The average crystalline size was calculated from the X-ray line broadening, according to Scherrer's equation. Fourier transform Raman spectra (FT-Raman) were recorded with a RTS 100/S FT-RAMAN spectrometer (BRUKER, Germany) with liquid N 2 detector, using the 1064 nm excitation line of Nd-YAG laser. The sample powders were pressed into small disc and then mounted on the analytic chamber. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were analyzed on a PHI-1600 spectrometer (U.S.A.) equipped with Mg K\u03b1 radiation for exciting photoelectrons. X-ray source was operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and 250 W. The pressure in the ion-pumped analysis chamber was maintained at 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 during data acquisition. All binding energies (BE) were referenced to the adventitious C 1s line at 284.6 eV (1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10 \u221219 J). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed on a TPDRO 1100 apparatus supplied by Thermo-Finnigan Company. Fifty milligrams of the sample was heated from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under the mixture of 5% H 2 in N 2 flowing (20 ml/min). The H 2 uptake amount during the reduction was measured by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.3 Catalytic activity test The catalytic activity measurements of the prepared catalysts for CO oxidation were tested using a fixed bed flow microreactor (7 mm i.d.) under atmospheric pressure. 0.05 g catalyst powder was mixed with 2.00 g SiO 2 uniformly. The airflow rate was 33.3 ml/min, and the CO gas flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The reactant and product composition were analyzed on-line by a GC-508A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts Figs. 1 and 2 depict the XRD patterns of the catalysts with different Au loadings and prepared at different pH values, respectively. Diffractions attributed to the typical structure of CeO 2 (true cubic, fluorite structure) were clearly detectable for all the catalysts, which indicated that the zirconia dopant was contained within the lattice and not as a separate phase [5] . The same result can be confirmed by Raman spectroscopy ( Fig. 3 ). From Fig. 1 , no obvious peaks attributed to Au particles can be observed for the catalysts up to 4 wt.% gold suggesting a well-dispersed state of the gold particles on the support. When the Au loading increased to 6 wt.%, a small peak corresponding to Au(1 1 1) can be detected at 2 \u03b8 = 38.3\u00b0. We think that the agglomeration of gold particles on the surface of the support occur with the increase of gold loadings, which may have negative effect on the catalytic activities for CO oxidation. From Fig. 2 , we can find that the catalysts with the pH > 6 could not produce reflections characteristic of the Au particles. But for the catalyst with pH 6, a weak peak can be observed at 2 \u03b8 = 38.3\u00b0, which was the (1 1 1) plane of gold particles. When the pH was 5, the peak attributed to the gold particles at 2 \u03b8 = 38.3\u00b0 was obvious. The results indicated that the pH values adjusted in the process of preparation were mainly responsible for the dispersion degree of gold particles. The average particle sizes of the support calculated from line broadening of (1 1 1) diffraction peak by using Scherrer equation were similar and about 15.1 nm, which indicated that the addition of gold should have no effect on the size and structure of the support. The same result was reported by Flytzani-Stephanopoulos and coworkers [13] . The FT-Raman spectra of the support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 and the catalyst Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (pH 7) are shown in Fig. 3 . We can find that there was only one adsorption peak centered at about 464 cm \u22121 for the samples, which was typical of the F 2g Raman active mode of a fluorite structured material [14] . The result was in good agreement with the XRD analysis, which also indicated the presence of only the cubic fluorite structure type for the support of all the catalysts. Furthermore, the different intensity of the two samples can be observed. Because the atomic mass of Au is larger than that of Ce and Zr, we think the insertion of Au ions can decrease the vibration frequency of metal\u2013anion band and thus decrease the intensity of the catalyst. Fig. 4 shows the HRTEM micrographs of the support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (a) and the catalyst Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (pH 7) (b\u2013d). Viewed at lower magnifications ( Fig. 4 a and b), the two samples appeared to be spherical particles, which indicated that the addition of Au had no influence on the morphology of the support. The average particle sizes estimated from the HRTEM were about 15 nm and agreed well with that calculated from the Scherrer equation. From Fig. 4 c and d, the encircled darker particles could be discerned, but whether they were gold or smaller ceria particles was difficult to determine from the contrast. We think most of the gold particles could be much smaller and not detectable or they were less due to the lower Au loading. Furthermore, we can obtain the interplanar spacing (ca. 0.32 nm) from Fig. 4 d, corresponding to the value of the (1 1 1) facet of cubic, fluorite structure of CeO 2 . This can also be the identification for Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 structure which was in agreement with the result of the XRD analysis. XPS analysis showed in Fig. 5 reveals the presence of cerium, zirconium, gold and oxygen on the surface of the catalyst Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (pH 7) calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h. The XP spectrum of cerium 3d ( Fig. 5 a) showed two principle binding energies of Ce 3d 3/2 and Ce 3d 5/2 at about 900.6 and 882 eV, respectively. The difference of the binding energies between the Ce 3d 3/2 and Ce 3d 5/2 photoemission feature was about 18.6 eV, which was in agreement with the reported value [15] . The peak at about 916 eV was the satellite arising from the Ce 3d 3/2 ionization, while bands 885.2 and 898 eV were that of the Ce 3d 5/2 ionization. The main peaks at about 916 and 898 eV represented the 3d 10 4f 0 initial electronic state corresponding to the Ce 4+ ion, while a small peak at about 885.2 eV represented the 3d 10 4f 1 initial electronic state corresponding to the Ce 3+ ion. The XP spectrum of Ce 3d exhibited peaks due to the presence of both Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ , thus implying that both Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ presented on the surface of the catalyst. Reddy and Khan [16] considered that the reduction of Ce 4+ may occur under the procedure of XPS measurement. Delmon and coworkers [17] also considered that partial reduction could occur during the analysis if the exposure of the sample to exciting X-ray beam was long, and caused local heating of the sample. The XP spectrum of zirconium is showed in Fig. 5 b, the double peaks at about 182.0 and 184.4 eV corresponded to the Zr 3d 5/2 and Zr 3d 3/2 , respectively. The difference between the two peaks was in agreement with an expected value of about 2.4 eV [15] . The O 1s spectrum of the sample ( Fig. 5 c) showed two peaks, one main peak appearing at 529.5 eV represented the lattice oxygen associated with metal oxides and a shoulder peak at about 531.8 eV was attributed to the absorbed oxygen [5] . The Au 4f XP spectrum of the catalyst shown in Fig. 5 d consisted of two Au 4f 7/2 and one Au 4f 5/2 peaks. The peaks at about 84.0 and 88.0 eV were corresponded to the Au 4f 7/2 and Au 4f 5/2 , respectively, suggesting the Au 0 presented on the surface of the catalyst. While another Au 4f 7/2 component at about 86.5 eV can be assigned to Au 3+ species [18] . There was no indication of the presence of other Au species such as Au 1+ . Bond and Thompson proposed that both Au 0 and Au 3+ were required for high activity. They considered that Au 0 adsorbed CO, while Au 3+ cemented the metallic particle on the support and activated surface hydroxyl groups, which can react with the adsorbed CO to form adsorbed carboxylate [19] . However, whether ionic or metallic gold is important for high activity has been disputed. We think that the highly dispersed gold particles (Au 0 and Au 3+ ) were responsible for the superior catalytic performance, which was consistent with the XRD analysis. The surface chemical composition of the catalyst was also investigated by XPS. The Au/(Ce + Zr) atomic ratio value was 0.0067, which was in good agreement with that expected value for the bulk composition of the sample with 1.0 wt.% Au content (Au/(Ce + Zr) = 0.0066). The TPR profiles of the catalyst Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (pH 7) and the support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 are shown in Fig. 6 . Yao and Yao [20] have reported that the low-temperature reduction peak at 570 \u00b0C and the high temperature peak at 830 \u00b0C were typically interpreted as the reduction of surface-capping oxygen and bulk-phase lattice oxygen, respectively. Kang and Wan [21] reported that reduction peaks of Au at about 125 and 525 \u00b0C could be observed, which attributed to oxygen adsorbed on the surface of metallic gold and the reduction of Au 3+ , respectively. In Fig. 6 , it can be seen that for the support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 there were two obvious bands at about 530 \u00b0C (b) and 830 \u00b0C (c). While two main reduction peaks can be observed at 134 \u00b0C (a) and 822 \u00b0C (c) obviously for Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 and a weaker board reduction peak b can be observed, too. We can find that when gold was added, the lower temperature reduction peak shifted to the low value of 134 \u00b0C, which may be due to the fact that the presence of gold helped to weaken the surface oxygen on ceria-zirconia and thereby improved the reducibility of the catalyst [22] . Flytzani-Stephanopoulos and coworkers [13] suggested that this can facilitate the oxygen transfer across the solid\u2013gas interface during the reaction. We believed that the peaks b and c were attributed to a concomitant reduction of the surface/partially bulk reduction of the support and further reduction of the support in the bulk, respectively. Furthermore, we think the reduction of oxidic gold (Au 3+ ) may exist in the board peak b (420\u2013590 \u00b0C), although it was masked by the much higher amount of the surface oxygen associated to the ceria-zirconia. 3.2 Catalytic activity for CO oxidation The activities of the catalysts for CO oxidation as a function of the reaction temperature are shown in Figs. 7\u20139 . It can be observed that the CO conversion increased with the increasing reaction temperature for all the prepared catalysts. Most of the catalysts began to oxidize CO to CO 2 at 30 \u00b0C. In order to search the proper experimental condition, the influence of the pH values, Au contents, calcination temperature and time on the CO oxidation catalytic activity was studied. 3.2.1 Effect of the pH value Fig. 7 presents the catalytic activity for CO oxidation of the catalysts Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 prepared at different pH values. It is noted that the pH values of the solution had a great influence on the catalytic activity of the catalysts. With the same Au content and calcination condition (300 \u00b0C, 3 h), the temperatures of 100% CO conversion ( T 100% ) for these catalysts were different, obviously. The T 100% for the catalysts with pH 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 were 210, 150, 170, 170, 190 \u00b0C, respectively. While the catalyst with the pH 5 could not reach the complete conversion and the maximum CO conversion was only 66.0% under the given reaction condition. The XRD analysis results showed that the pH value adjusted in the process of preparation played an important role in the dispersion of gold on the support. When the pH < 7, the Au dispersion degree was lower than that of the samples with pH \u2265 7, which resulted in the inferior activity for the sample with pH 5 and 6. Several groups have reported that the presence of the chloride ions was detrimental to the catalytic property of the catalyst [23\u201326] . Haruta et al. [24] have reported that when the pH value achieved to above 6, the main Au species was transformed from AuCl 4\u2212 to Au(OH) n Cl 4\u2212 n \u2212 ( n = 1\u20133). In our present study, the catalytic activity for the catalysts increased from pH 5 to 7, but it decreased when the pH > 7 and the catalyst with pH 7 exhibited a better catalytic activity. According to the above analyses, we think that much chloride ions might associate with the gold complex ions adsorbed on the support at pH 5 and 6, while chloride ions decrease and OH \u2212 increase with increasing pH value. The similar result was reported by Zhu et al. [23] . Therefore, we suggested that pH 7 was a suitable condition to prepare other samples. 3.2.2 Effect of the Au content The catalytic activity of the catalysts Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 with different Au contents is shown in Fig. 8 . It depicted that the activity of the support Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 was quite low, but the Au-loading catalysts showed higher catalytic activities. This indicated that there was a strong interaction between gold and the support, which was responsible for the high CO catalytic activity [13] . In the present case, the addition of gold played an important role in the catalytic performance of the catalysts. The T 100% of the samples with 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 wt.% Au loadings were 200, 190, 150, 140, 140 and 150 \u00b0C, respectively, and the 0.1 wt.% Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 cannot reach the complete conversion under the experimental condition. The phenomena can be explained by TPR analysis which showed that the addition of gold can weaken the surface oxygen on ceria-zirconia and improve the reducibility of the catalyst [22] . It is noted that the T 100% decreased with the increase of the gold loadings from 0.1 to 2 wt.%, however, it increased when the Au loading increased from 4 to 6 wt.%. This indicated that a well-dispersed state of gold particles on the surface of support was responsible for the superior catalytic property and the agglomeration of gold particles may have negative contribution in the present study, which was in good agreement with the result of XRD and XPS analyses. For the purpose of comparison, the Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 was selected to continue the following study. 3.2.3 Effect of the calcination temperature and time The influence of calcination temperature and calcination time of the catalysts Au(1 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (pH 7) on the catalytic activity for low-temperature CO oxidation was investigated and the results are showed in Fig. 9 . The different calcination process can lead to different catalytic effect for the catalysts. It is noted that higher calcination temperature and longer calcination time had negative effect on the catalytic activity. It can be found that the catalyst calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h showed higher catalytic performance ( T 100% = 150 \u00b0C). Zhu et al. [23] have reported that higher calcination temperature can accelerates the agglomeration of the gold particles and decrease the activity of catalyst. It can be seen that the T 100% of the sample calcined at 400 and 500 \u00b0C for 3 h were 160 and 180 \u00b0C, respectively, which were higher than that of the sample calcined at 300 \u00b0C. But when the calcination temperature was 200 \u00b0C, the T 100% was 170 \u00b0C, which showed a decrease in the catalytic activity. We think that at lower temperature, small particles can be obtained but the interaction between gold and the support was weak and influenced the catalytic performance. The catalysts with the treatment at different calcination time showed the similar catalytic performance, the T 100% of the samples calcined 300 \u00b0C for 1, 2, 4 h were all 160 \u00b0C, but when the calcination time increased to 5 h, the T 100% increased to 170 \u00b0C. This may be due to the agglomeration of gold when it was calcined for long time. From Figs. 7\u20139 , it can be seen that the Au(2 wt.%)/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalyst with pH 7 and calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h exhibited the best catalytic performance ( T 100% = 140 \u00b0C) in the present case. The results indicated that the pH values, Au contents, calcination temperature and time had evident influence on the catalytic performance of the Au-loading catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation under the experimental conditions. 4 Conclusions Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 nano-particles and Au/Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts were successfully prepared by hydrothermal route combined with deposition-precipitation method. XRD and FT-Raman analyses indicated the presence of only the cubic fluorite structure type for the support of the catalysts. The HRTEM measurements showed that the morphology of the samples was spherical. XPS analysis revealed both Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ existed on the surface of the catalyst and the Au species presented were Au 0 and Au 3+ . The study of the catalytic activity for CO oxidation indicated that the catalytic property of the catalysts strongly depended on the pH values adjusted in the process of preparation, gold loadings, calcination temperature and time. It can be observed that the addition of gold can improve the reducibility of the catalyst obviously, which may be due to the weaker bonding of the surface oxygen with ceria-zirconia revealed by TPR analysis [23] . From the XRD and XPS analyses, we think highly dispersed gold particles were responsible for better catalytic activity and the agglomeration of gold particles may have negative contribution. The suitable condition to prepare the catalysts was pH 7 and the optimum thermal pretreatment were 300 \u00b0C and 3 h. References [1] A. Trovarelli C. De Leitenburg M. Boaro R. Dolcetti Catal.

In this work, 3D hierarchically porous ZnO architectures were synthesized via an amino acid-assisted biomimetic hydrothermal method combined with subsequent calcination. First a basic zinc carbonate (BZC) precursor with a lamellar spherical morphology assembled by interconnected nanosheets was synthesized. By subsequent calcination, the as-obtained BZC precursor can be facilely transformed into porous ZnO with a large surface area of 193.7 m2/g, while maintaining its 3D hierarchical morphology. The 3D hierarchically porous ZnO superstructures are further employed as a support to load Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) to construct hybrid nanomaterials for chemical gas sensors. The AuNP-functionalized 3D hierarchically porous ZnO nanomaterials, combining the high surface accessibility of porous materials and catalytic activity of small AuNPs, demonstrated excellent sensor properties in terms of higher sensitivity and very fast response. Furthermore, it is expected this AuNP-functionalized 3D hierarchically porous nanostructure may provide a new pathway to develop advanced nanomaterials for applications like gas sensors, low temperature CO oxidation and photocatalysis. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The gas sensing properties of undoped and Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors were investigated. Compared with the undoped one, the doped sensors exhibited higher response, better selectivity, and faster response/recovery to H 2 S. The operating temperature of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 to H 2 S is decreased after the addition of Pd, which result in the relative low power consumption in H 2 S detection. Among all the doped sensors, the sensor of 1.5 wt% Pd/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 showed the largest response (128.3) to 100 ppm H 2 S at 160 \u00b0C. Keywords Gas sensor Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 H 2 S Low power consumption 1 Introduction The increasing concern on environmental protection and human health has generated great interests in efficient gas detection [1\u20133] . \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 is an n-type metal oxide semiconductor, and has been used as gas sensing material since the 1980s of the last century [4,5] . There have been many reports about good response and selectivity of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to combustible gases and organic vapors in recent years, such as ethanol, acetone, gasoline and LPG, etc. [6,7] , while their gas sensing properties to H 2 S have been seldom reported until now. Recently, Zhang et al. found that \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 exhibited sensitivity to H 2 S based on the catalytic chemiluminescence at 360 \u00b0C [8] . Wang et al. reported the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors synthesized by microwave hydrolysis had a high sensitivity at 300 \u00b0C [9] . However, their application is limited by the high operating temperature. As a consequence, it is important to design new type of low power consumption H 2 S sensor. Noble metal doping is an effective approach to improve the gas sensing properties of sensors. For instance, Kobayashi et al. developed CO sensor based on Au-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 [10] . Shen et al. found that the response of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to CO was greatly improved after it was doped with PdO [11] . In this paper, Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were prepared by coprecipitation method. The gas sensing properties of the sensors were also investigated. 2 Experimental All the reagents are of analytical grade and used as purchased. Pd/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powders were prepared by a coprecipitation method [12] . A small quantity of polyglycol was added to an aqueous solution of PdCl 2 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 wt%) and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O. The aqueous mixture was then added dropwise to an aqueous solution of Na 2 CO 3 under vigorous stirring at 80 \u00b0C. The pH of the solution was adjusted by diluted Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution in the reaction process. After stirring for 1 h, a solid precipitate was formed and kept digesting overnight at room temperature. Then the precipitate was washed with deionized water, dried at 80 \u00b0C and calcined at 400 \u00b0C for an hour, a series of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powders were obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on D/MAX-RAX diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 100 mA, using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5, scanning range 2 u : 20\u2013758). Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a Philips\u2013T20ST electron microscope, operating at 200 kV. The gas sensing behavior was investigated by using the commercial gas sensing measurement system of HW-30A from Henan Hanwei Electronical Technology Co. Ltd. An alumina substrate tube with 4 mm length was used for the heater and sensing base. The schematic diagram of a typical gas sensor is shown in Fig. 1 . A small Ni\u2013Cr alloy coil was placed through the tube to supply the operating temperatures from 100 to 500 \u00b0C. Electrical contacts were made with two platinum wires attached to each gold electrode. The Pd/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powder was mixed with terpineol to form a paste. Then the paste was coated onto the outside surface of the alumina tube. In order to improve their stability and repeatability, the gas sensors were sintered at 300 \u00b0C for 10 days in air. Gas sensing properties of the sensors were tested in a glass chamber with a volume of 15 L. The test gases were injected into the closed chamber by a microinjector. Gas sensitivity of the side-heated gas sensors was measured under a steady-state condition. The schematic representation and the measuring principle of the gas sensor are shown in Fig. 2 . The operating voltage (Vh) was supplied to either of the coils for heating the sensors and the circuit voltage (Vc = 10 V) was supplied across the sensors and the load resistor (RL = 1 M\u03a9) connected in series. The signal voltage across the load, which changed with sort and concentration of gas, was measured. In the gas sensitivity measurement, a given amount of sample gases were injected into a closed chamber by a microinjector and mixed by a fan for 20 s (liquids were firstly evaporated and then mixed by a fan for 20 s). The gas response S is defined as the ratio R a / R g , where R a and R g are the resistances measured in air and in a test gas, respectively. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Material characterization Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 doped with 1.5 wt% Pd additions. The diffraction pattern of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (1.5 wt% Pd) matched perfectly with the standard \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 reflections (JCPDS No. 33-664). However, no obvious Pd peaks was observed, which may be due to high dispersion of Pd particles. The sharp peaks suggest that the crystal of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 is perfect. The mean size of the crystals is around 40 nm, calculated by the Deby\u2013Scherrer equation. TEM image of 1.5 wt% Pd/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 is shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the morphology of the particles is spherical. The size of the particles is 30\u201350 nm in diameter, which agrees with the results from XRD pattern. 3.2 Gas sensing properties The gas sensing properties of undoped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 and Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 were studied. It is well known that the gas sensitivity is greatly influenced by the operating temperature and the amounts of additives. In order to determine the optimum operating temperature and additive amount, responses of all the sensors to 100 ppm H 2 S gas at different operating temperatures were examined. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that the response of the sensors to H 2 S varies with not only the amount of Pd but also the operating temperature. Each curve reveals a maximum at an optimum operating temperature. The undoped sensor has the maximum gas response at 200 \u00b0C, while all the doped sensors have the maximum gas response about 160 \u00b0C. The operating temperature of Pd doped sensors is lower, compared with previous reports [13\u201315] about H 2 S sensor. The lower operating temperature would result in the lower energy consumption, which may be attributed to the presence of Pd. Furthermore, all the doped sensors exhibit much higher response than the undoped one. Especially, the sensor doped with 1.5 wt% Pd exhibits the largest response to H 2 S at 160 \u00b0C. Selectivity is an important parameter in gas sensing, and the sensor has to have rather high selectivity for its application. As far as we know from the recent researches, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor also responds to other gases such as ethanol and acetone. Therefore, we examined the responses of the 1.5 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to other seven gases of 1000 ppm at different operating temperatures. From Fig. 6 , it can be observed that the sensor exhibits the largest response to H 2 S, moderate responses to ethanol and acetone, and negligible responses to n -hexane, NH 3 , H 2 and CO. On the other hand, the optimum operating temperature to ethanol and acetone is 200 \u00b0C, which is higher than that to H 2 S. The selectivity to H 2 S is higher when the operating temperature is about 160 \u00b0C. As a result, it is easier to detect H 2 S at lower operating temperatures. As has been generally reported, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 is a typical n-type semiconductor, and its gas-sensing mechanism belongs to the surface-controlled type. The change of resistance is dependent on the species and chemisorbed oxygen on the surface. The oxygen absorbed on the surface of an \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor cause the electron depletion, consequently the resistance of the sensor increases. The process can be expressed in the following reactions: (1) O 2 (gas) \u2192 O 2 (ads) (2) O 2 (ads) + e \u2212 \u2192 O 2 \u2212 (ads) (3) O 2 \u2212 (ads) + e \u2212 \u2192 2O \u2212 (ads) (4) O \u2212 (ads) + e \u2212 \u2192 O 2\u2212 (ads) With introduction of H 2 S gas, it would be oxidized by these chemisorbed oxygen species (O 2 \u2212 , O \u2212 , O 2\u2212 ) on the surface of the sensor. During this reaction, the electrons back into the semiconductor, resulting in a decrease in resistance of the sensor. When the sensor is exposed in air again, the gases are desorbed as H 2 O and SO 2 . This reaction process may be as Eq. (5) . (5) H 2 S + 3O 2\u2212 \u2192 H 2 O + SO 2 + 6e \u2212 The effect of noble metal addition on the gas sensing properties of metal oxide has been widely studied [16\u201319] . This influence has formally been classified as chemical or electronic according to two basic sensitization mechanisms. The two mechanisms are so-called spill-over and Fermi-level effect, respectively. Pd is typically considered to be related with the electronic one [20\u201322] . In the electronic mechanism, the reaction with gas molecules takes place on the dopants surface. These dopants change the electrostatic potential due to their different electron affinities, which gives rise to a variation of the surface barrier height. This results in the corresponding resistance change of the base semiconductor. On the other hand, Pd dopants, as a catalyst, enhance the adsorption of gas molecules and accelerate the electron exchange between the sensor and the test gas. All these factors together contribute to the improvement of gas sensing properties of the Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors. The gas response of the undoped and 1.5 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to various gases at their optimum operating temperatures are compared in Fig. 7 . The responses of 1.5 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to all of these gases are much higher than that of the undoped one, especially to H 2 S. Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the response of the 1.5 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor and the H 2 S concentration (10\u2013200 ppm) at 160 \u00b0C. It can be seen that the response increases with the H 2 S concentration, and the concentration dependence presents good linearity, which suggests that the Pd/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 could meet the applications in H 2 S sensing. Furthermore, the sensor still shows excellent response to low concentration H 2 S, and its response to 10 ppm H 2 S is 46.6. Response and recovery times are the basic parameters of gas sensors, which are defined as the time required to reach 90% of the final resistance. Fig. 9 shows the response\u2013recovery characteristics of 1.5 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 to H 2 S at different concentrations. As can be seen from the curve, the sensor responds very rapidly after introduction of H 2 S and recovers immediately when it is exposed to air. The result indicates that the sensor can meet the practical application in H 2 S detection. The stability of the 1.5 wt% Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor was measured at a level of 100 ppm H 2 S after ageing for 60 days. The results are shown in Fig. 10 , from which it is seen that the sensor presented nearly constant response to H 2 S even after 2 months. We believe that Pd/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors have promising applications in H 2 S sensing in the future. 4 Conclusions In summary, the Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors have been prepared by chemical coprecipitation method. Compared with the undoped one, the doped sensors present much higher sensitivity, better selectivity and rather lower optimum operating temperature to H 2 S than the undoped one. The optimum doping amount is 1.5 wt% and the optimum operating temperature is 160 \u00b0C. The doped sensors also present long-term stability and short response/recovery time. Obtained results indicate that the Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor should be a type of promising H 2 S sensor at relatively low working temperature.

The results of XRD measurement indicated that Pd- Cu alloy was formed in the bimetallic catalysts and the crystalline particle size of the alloy increased as Cu contents increased with average diameters < 6.0nm for all the samples. XPS and Auger spectra showed that Pd was in zero- valent state, Cu existed mainly in zero- valent state and partially in monovalent state Cu+. The Pd/\u03b3-Al 2O3 and Pd-Cu/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalysts exhibited higher activity for CO oxidation at low temperature. The activity of Pd-Cu/\u03b3-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst was higher than that of Pd/\u03b3-Al2O3 monometallic catalyst. The Pd-Cu/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst with Pd/Cu atomic ratio of 1:1 showed the highest activity.",

The obtained Au-functionalized ZnO nanoplates were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Comparative gas sensing studies were carried out on both pristine ZnO and Au/ZnO nanoplates in order to investigate the effect of Au nanoparticles on the sensor performances. Obtained results demonstrated that the Au/ZnO nanoplate sensor exhibited faster response and recovery as well as higher response compared with the pristine ZnO sensor. At 300\u00b0C, the response time of Au/ZnO to 5 ppm ethanol is 13 s, while that of ZnO is up to 135 s. The enhanced sensor performances were attributed to the unique chemical properties of Au nanoparticles and the electronic metal-support interaction. A possible sensing mechanism was proposed for the Au/ZnO nanoplates. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this work, peculiar porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres were fabricated by a glycine-assisted hydrothermal method. They have large mesopores (ca. 10 nm) in the core and small mesopores (<4 nm) in the shell. To our best knowledge, there have been so far no reports on the synthesis of such peculiar porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were employed to characterize the obtained Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres. Effects of preparation conditions, such as reactants, reaction temperature and reaction duration, were investigated on the morphology and structure of Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres. It was shown that the morphology and structure could be readily controlled by the time and temperature of hydrothermal treatment. The formation mechanism was proposed based on experimental results, which shows that glycine molecules play an important role in the formation of the morphology and porous structure of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 porous nanospheres were used as gas sensing layer, and exhibited excellent gas-sensing properties to ethanol in terms of response and selectivity. The sensors showed good reproducibility and stability as well as short response (9 s) and recovery time (43 s) even at an ethanol concentration as low as 50 ppm. The gas-sensing properties of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres are also significantly better than those of previously reported Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (ca. 30 nm). The sensitivity of the former is over four times higher than that of the latter at varied ethanol concentrations. The gas-sensing mechanism was discussed in details. Both fast response and steady signal make these peculiar nanostructures a promising candidate for ethanol detection. Keywords Glycine assisted Hydrothermal synthesis Hematite Porous structure Gas sensor 1 Introduction Nanomaterials of well-defined size and morphology have attracted considerable research efforts because of their size- and morphology-dependent properties. Among them are porous metal oxides. A variety of porous metal oxides including those of TiO 2 [1,2] , SnO 2 [3] , ZnO [4\u20139] and In 2 O 3 [10] have been synthesized and explored for applications in catalysis, lithium-ion batteries, gas sensing, and so on. Hematite (\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 ), a stable phase of iron oxide, is an n-type semiconductor ( E g = 2.1 eV). It is non-toxic, highly resistant to corrosion, and environment friendly. It has been intensively investigated for applications in catalysts [11\u201313] , lithium-ion batteries [14,15] , water treatment [16,17] and gas sensors [18\u201324] . Hematite of varied morphologies have been fabricated, including nanocrystals [25,26] , particles [27\u201329] , cubes [30] , rods [31,32] , wires [33] , tubes [34] , flute-like [18] , hollow spheres [35] and nanocups [36] , and ordered mesoporous Fe 2 O 3 [37] . Glycine-assisted hydrothermal synthesis is frequently used to prepare specific structures [38,39] . For example, Prevot and co-workers prepared flower-like NiAl-layered double hydroxides using Ni (II) glycinate complex as precursor [38] . Zhang and co-workers prepared hollow Ni(OH) 2 microspheres using Ni (II) glycinate complex under strong basic conditions. Glycine played an important role in the formation of the specific morphologies and architectures [39] . In the current work, glycine-assisted hydrothermal synthesis was adopted to prepare \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanomaterials. The obtained nanomaterials were analysed by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and selected area electron diffraction. The results showed that the obtained nanomaterials consist of spherical particles of pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 phase. The spherical particles have pores of dual sizes in the core and shell, respectively. The gas-sensing properties of the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres were evaluated, and better sensing performance was observed compared with that using \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles of 30 nm in size [40] . 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and synthesis All chemicals used were analytic grade, and used as received without further purification. Ultrapure water used in experiments had a resistivity of 18.2 M\u03a9 cm, and was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q system (Academic). In a typical synthesis, 0.9 g of urea, 1 g of FeCl 3 \u00b76H 2 O, and 2 g of glycine were dissolved in 30 mL of pure water, and stirred for 20 min to form a purple-black solution. The mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 160 \u00b0C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, a red product was isolated by centrifugation, and washed several times with pure water and absolute ethanol. It was dried in air at 80 \u00b0C for 8 h, and calcined at 450 \u00b0C for 3 h in air and in nitrogen, respectively. 2.2 Materials characterization The phase structure and purity of the products were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer (Germany) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analyses were carried out on a Hitachi S-4300 scanning electron microscope (Japan). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were taken on a JEM 2100F transmission electron microscope. 2.3 Gas sensor fabrication and characterization The calcined \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres were mixed with water, and then coated onto an alumina tube which was connected to a pair of Au electrodes and four Pt wires on both ends of the tube. The operating temperature was controlled by adjusting the heating power using a Ni\u2013Cr alloy coil placed through the tube. The gas-sensing element was aged at 300 \u00b0C for 7 days in order to improve stability and reproducibility. Gas-sensing properties of the gas-sensing elements were studied using a HW-30A gas sensitivity instrument (China). A given amount of tested gas was injected into a chamber, and mixed with air. The gas sensitivity S is defined as the ratio of R a / R g , where R a is the resistance measured in air and R g is that measured in tested gas atmosphere. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structure and morphology of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the Fe 2 O 3 product before and after calcination in air. All the diffraction peaks were readily indexed to a pure rhombohedral phase [space group: R\u22123c (167)] of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (JSPDS card No. 89-0597) [25] . No other impurities could be detected by XRD. The increases in peak intensities after calcination indicate that the annealing at 450 \u00b0C for 3 h enhanced the crystallinity of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 product. The annealed \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 product was observed by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2 a shows its typical low-magnification TEM image. It consists of nearly monodisperse spherical particles of 90 nm in size. Fig. 2 b presents a TEM image, showing that the spherical particles in fact contain randomly distributed pores. A close view further reveals that there are two types of pore, one is large mesopores (ca. 10 nm) inside the dashed circle, and the other is small mesopores (<4 nm) at the rim. SEM image ( Fig. 2 c) also shows that the annealed \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 product consists of nearly monodisperse spheres. High-resolution TEM image ( Fig. 2 d) discloses clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.37 nm, which is consistent with the d value of the (0 1 2) plane [25] . SAED pattern ( Fig. 2 e) indicates a single-crystal diffraction nature of the annealed \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 product. EDS was used to determine the chemical composition of the annealed \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 product ( Fig. 2 f). The results showed that it contains Fe and O, and the atomic ratio of Fe to O is 2:3, in good agreement with the stoichiometry of Fe 2 O 3 . Reaction temperature usually plays an important role in hydrothermal synthesis. Fig. 3 shows TEM images of uncalcined \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 products obtained at different hydrothermal temperatures. When the hydrothermal temperature is 120 \u00b0C, the product consists of nearly monodisperse solid spherical particles of rough surface. Pores are not clearly noticeable inside the spherical particles. The product obtained at 160 \u00b0C ( Fig. 3 c), however, consists of spherical particles with smooth surface. Pores are clearly seen inside the spherical particles ( Fig. 3 d). Apparently, the porous structure had formed before calcination though calcination might further expand the pore size. Therefore, hydrothermal temperature of 160 \u00b0C is appropriate for forming the porous structure. The addition of urea and glycine may also play an important role in obtaining the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 spheres [38,39] . When FeCl 3 and glycine were hydrothermally treated without addition of urea at 160 \u00b0C, spherical particles were obtained, which have smooth surface and are uniform in size ( Fig. 4 a ). Mesopores are not clearly noticeable, as shown in magnified TEM image ( Fig. 4 b) though glycine molecules could form small micelles in solution [38,39] . Without addition of glycine, particles of irregular shapes were obtained ( Fig. 4 c), and they are nonporous, as revealed in Fig. 4 d. The corresponding XRD patterns ( Fig. 4 e and f) show that both products have a pure rhombohedral phase of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . 3.2 Plausible formation mechanism of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres Before the hydrothermal treatment, i.e., during the mixing of precursors, several reactions may have occurred, such as precipitation, hydrolysis, dissolution and metal ion complexation. FeCl 3 dissolved in water, and formed a yellow-brown transparent solution. When glycine was added into the solution, the color of the mixture changed to purple-black, and the solution was opaque. Fe 3+ ion and glycine might form a coordination compound. At the early stage of the hydrothermal treatment, urea decomposed to NH 3 and CO 2 [41,42] . CO 2 could form stable bubbles due to glycine, and NH 3 dissolved in water and formed a basic solution (after the hydrothermal treatment and the autoclave was opened, NH 3 could smell). Under such basic conditions, glycine (p K a1 = 2.34, p K a2 = 9.60 and pHi = 5.97) was present in the Gly \u2212 (H 2 N\u2013CH 2 \u2013COO \u2212 ) form [39] . Fe 3+ ions hydrolyzed, and iron oxide nanocrystals formed under the basic conditions. The \u2013COO \u2212 terminal of glycine connected with iron oxide nanocrystal. Under the conditions of high temperature and pressure in the autoclave, the nanocrystal and bubble could connect by free glycine molecules in the solution. To understand the formation of the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres, time-dependent experiments were carried out, and resultant products were analysed by TEM. When the reaction time was \u226430 min, small Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystals (shown in Fig. 5 a by black arrows) and stable bubbles would form in the mixture [43,44] . By increasing the reaction time to 1 h, nanocrystals assembled together with the assistance of glycine, forming nearly monodisperse raspberry-like porous aggregates ( Fig. 5 a). With increase of the reaction time, iron oxide nanocrystals further deposited on the surface of raspberry-like aggregates, which continuously transformed to nanospheres having a core with large mesopores ( Fig. 5 b). Finally, a porous core/shell structure gradually formed ( Fig. 5 c and d) resulting in the peculiar porous structures. This process is similar to the hollowing process described in a previous report in which glycine was also used as an additive. Solid spheres formed first, and an interior cavity gradually formed via a core evacuation process [38,39] . XRD patterns of the products ( Fig. 6 ) show that peak intensities gradually increase with the reaction time, indicating that the pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 crystal structure already formed in the early stage of precipitation. The increase in crystallinity confirms that Ostwald ripening (crystallites grow at the expense of smaller ones) is the underlying mechanism in this pore-forming process [38,39,45\u201347] . 3.3 Gas-sensing properties of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres Development of gas sensors with improved performance has recently become a hot topic because of increasing concerns over environmental pollution and public safety [48,49] . Porous metal oxides are favorable to the diffusion of target gases due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and well-defined pore structure [49] . As an n-type semiconductor, one of the most important applications of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 is gas sensors. For example, hematite nanostructures containing hierarchical mesopores, such as colloidal crystal clusters and monodisperse porous nanospheres, were used for gas sensors, and showed better sensing performance as compared with commercial \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 particles [50,51] . Therefore, a gas sensor was fabricated using porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres, and its sensing properties were investigated. It is well known that the operation temperature largely affects the sensitivity of a semiconductor sensor [48\u201355] . In order to determine the optimal operation temperature, the response of the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanosphere gas sensor to ethanol of varied concentrations in air was evaluated as a function of the operation temperature. As shown in Fig. 7 , the sensor response varies with the operation temperature. At three different ethanol concentrations, all the sensitivities increase with increase of the operation temperature from 180 to 260 \u00b0C. When the operation temperature is over 260 \u00b0C, however, the sensitivity gradually drops with further increase of temperature. The optimal operation temperature of 260 \u00b0C was selected for following studies. Fig. 8 shows a response curve of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanosphere sensor to ethanol of varied concentrations at 260 \u00b0C. Clearly, the voltage response is proportional to the ethanol concentration between 50 and 1000 ppm. The response and recovery times, which are defined as the time to reach 90% of the final resistance, are important parameters for gas sensors. For 50 ppm ethanol, the response and recovery times are 9 and 43 s, respectively. The sensor still has fast response and recovery even exposed to ethanol vapor of high concentration, indicating good response/recovery capabilities. Practically, the sensor selectivity is extremely important. We thus measured the response of the sensor to several other substances such as CHCl 3 , ethyl ether, and CO at identical concentration (50 ppm) and operation temperature (260 \u00b0C). As shown in Fig. 9 , the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanosphere sensor has higher sensitivity to ethanol than to the other substances. Therefore, the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanosphere sensor could selectively detect ethanol in the presence of other potential interfering substances. The sensing performance of the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres was compared with that of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles of ca. 30 nm as reported in a previous work [40] . The results are shown in Fig. 10 . Clearly, the response profiles are similar in shape, and the sensitivity increases almost linearly with increase of the ethanol concentration in both cases. From Fig. 10 , two linear equations could be derived as follows: (1) Porous \u2009 \u03b1 -F e 2 O 3 \u2009 nanospheres : \u2003 S = 0.062 C + 5.59 , \u2009 r = 0.992 , (2) \u03b1 -F e 2 O 3 \u2009 nanoparticles \u2009 of \u2009 ca . \u2009 30 \u2009 nm : \u2003 S = 0.0072 C + 1.61 , \u2009 r = 0.952 , where S is the sensitivity, C is the concentration of ethanol. The sensitivity of the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanosphere sensor increases dramatically with increase of ethanol concentration, and is much higher than that of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, especially at higher ethanol concentrations [40] . The sensitivities of the former are almost several times greater than those of the latter for all the ethanol vapors of varied concentrations. Thus, the gas-sensing performance of the porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres is much better than that of the previously reported \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. There are many oxygen vacancies on the surface of the sensing material [9,19,45,49] . When the sensor is in air, oxygen molecules are adsorbed at these oxygen vacancies, forming active oxygen adsorbates, such as O 2\u2212 , O \u2212 , and O 2 \u2212 . The formation of the oxygen adsorbate layer would lead to the transfer of electrons from the sensor surface to the adsorbate layer, and so the electron density would decrease on the sensor surface. The oxygen ions react with ethanol molecules on the surface when the sensor is exposed to ethanol vapor, and thus release the trapped electrons to the sensor. This leads to the change in resistance of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor. The amount of oxygen and test gas on the surface of materials is strongly dependent on the microstructure of the materials, such as particle size, morphology and porosity. Conventional \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticle sensors have poor porosity and relatively large particle size, whereas porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 spheres have abundant pores in their structures, which can facilitate the diffusion of gas molecules and provide more adsorption\u2013desorption sites. Very interestingly, if the as-synthesized Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres were calcined in nitrogen (named as Fe 2 O 3 (N 2 )) instead of air, the sensor based on Fe 2 O 3 (N 2 ) showed no sensing properties even in ethanol vapor of higher concentration. The mechanism is still under investigation. 4 Conclusions In summary, peculiar porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres were obtained by glycine-assisted synthesis. They have large mesopores (ca. 10 nm) in the core and small mesopores (<4 nm) in the shell. To our best knowledge, there have been so far no reports on the synthesis of such peculiar porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres. The time and temperature of hydrothermal treatment influence the structure and morphology of product. The \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 crystal phase forms at the early stage, and extended reaction time results in enhanced crystallinity of product. \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanostructures obtained at different reaction times are shown to follow a nucleation and growth process resembling Ostwald ripening with the assistance of glycine molecules. The porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres were used as a gas sensing layer, and exhibited excellent gas-sensing properties to ethanol in terms of response and selectivity. The gas-sensing properties of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanospheres are also significantly better than those of previously reported Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (ca. 30 nm). Both fast response and steady signal make these peculiar nanostructures a promising candidate for ethanol detection.

        "title": "Synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic characterization of a dinuclear Mn(II) complex with double end-on azide ligands",
        "abstract": "A novel dinuclear manganese(II) complex [MnL(N 3 ) 2 ] 2 \u00b7 2CH 3 OH 1 has been synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In the complex 1 , each Mn(II) ion is coordinated by one L, one terminal azide ligand and symmetrical double end-on bridging azide ligands. Abstract A new dinuclear manganese(II) complex [MnL(N 3 ) 2 ] 2 \u00b7 2CH 3 OH 1 has been synthesized and characterized crystallographically and magnetically. L is a tridentate Schiff base ligand which is derived from the reaction of pyridine-2-carbaldehyde and 2-aminoethylbenzimidazole. In the complex 1 , each Mn(II) ion is coordinated by one L, one terminal azide ligand and symmetrical double end-on bridging azide ligands. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds extend the structure into a two-dimensional layer. Magnetic determination of 1 indicates that ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two manganese(II) ions exist in this complex through the double end-on azide bridges. Keywords Manganese(II) Double end-on azide Dinuclear complex Magnetic properties People have paid intense attention to the azide ligand due to its rich coordination modes [1] . The azide has been utilized widely not only as a versatile bridging ligand but also as an excellent magnetic coupler [2\u20135] during the last decade. From the magnetic point of view, the coordination modes of the azide ligands greatly affect the nature and magnitude of the magnetic exchange interaction in the dinuclear complexes. The magnetic coupling mediated through azide bridges is normally ferromagnetic [6] for the end-on (\u03bc-1,1 or EO) and antiferromagnetic for the end-to-end mode (\u03bc-1,3 or EE), respectively [7,8] . To date, many azide bridged transition metal complexes with multiform structures have been reported and magnetically characterized [9] . It is very essential to illuminate factors that affect the magnetic exchange by means of azide bridges. On the other hand, the appropriate choice of metal ions along with the bridged ligands is also an important factor. Among the first-row transition metal ions, the high-spin Mn II centers are quite desirable because they contain highest possible number of unpaired electrons [10] . Up to now, the reported Mn(II)-azido complexes include one-dimensional (1D) chain complexes [11] , two-dimensional (2D) layer complexes [12] , three-dimensional (3D) framework complexes [13,14] and polynuclear complexes [15] . However, to the best of our knowledge, the examples of the dinuclear Mn(II) complexes bridged by symmetrical double end-on azide ligands are very scarce [16] . Herein we report the synthesis, structure and the magnetic properties of a new dinuclear Mn(II) complex [MnL(N 3 ) 2 ] 2 \u00b7 2CH 3 OH 1 . L is a new tridentate Schiff base ligand obtained from the reaction of pyridine-2-carbaldehyde and 2-aminoethylbenzimidazole. In the complex 1 , ferromagnetic interaction was observed between two manganese(II) centers bridged by double end-on azide ligands. All reagents used in the syntheses were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin\u2013Elmer analyzer model 240. The magnetic measurements of the sample were carried out in an applied field of 5000 G using a SQUID magnetometer in the temperature range of 2\u2013300 K. Synthesis of the single crystal of [MnL(N 3 ) 2 ] 2 \u00b7 2CH 3 OH 1 . A mixture of pyridine-2-carbaldehyde (0.1 mmol, 0.0107 g) and 2-aminoethylbenzimidazole (0.1 mmol, 0.0232 g) in 10 mL methanol was refluxed for 2 h. Yellow solution of L was obtained. Then a methanolic solution (10 mL) containing manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate (0.1 mmol, 0.0245 g) was added. At last sodium azide (0.4 mmol, 0.0260 g) dissolved in 5 mL methanol was added under stirring. Orange crystals of complex 1 appeared by slow evaporation of the resulting orange solution at room temperature within two days. The yield was 27.81 mg (Mn, 65.98%). Anal. Calcd. for C 32 H 36 Mn 2 N 20 O 2 : C, 45.61; H, 2.15; O, 3.80. Found: C, 45.69; H, 2.12; O, 3.76%. It structure was solved by direct methods and successive Fourier difference syntheses ( shelxs -97) and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedure on F 2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms ( shelxl -97) [17] . [MnL(N 3 ) 2 ] 2 \u00b7 2CH 3 OH 1 : The atom labeling scheme and molecular view of 1 is shown in Fig. 1 [18] , the structure consists of centrosymmetric [MnL(N 3 ) 2 ] 2 \u00b7 2CH 3 OH dimers formed by the union of two MnL(N 3 ) 2 \u00b7 CH 3 OH fragments. Each manganese(II) cation shows distorted octahedral geometry. Three nitrogen atoms from L and one nitrogen atom from one bridging azide group form the equatorial plane, while one nitrogen atom from the other bridging azide group and the nitrogen atom of the terminal azide ligand are situated in the axial positions. Two manganese(II) cations are linked by two end-on bridging azide groups. The other two azides act as terminal ligands ( Fig. 1 ). This type of [MnN 6 ] octahedral sphere is similar to that in previous reported complex [16] . The Mn\u2013N 1,1-azide bond distances [2.157(19) \u00c5 and 2.359(2) \u00c5] are somewhat different with the similar type complex [16] . And the N 1,1-azide \u2013Mn\u2013N 1,1-azide bond angle 79.62(7)\u00b0 is larger than analogous complexes 75.4(1)\u00b0 and 77.00(10)\u00b0 [16a,16b] . The existence of an inversion center causes Mn1\u2013N8\u2013Mn1A\u2013N8A bridging unit to form a plane. In this dimeric unit, the Mn\u22efMn separation distance is 3.472 \u00c5, which is smaller than that of similar complexes (3.495, 3.513 and 3.525 \u00c5) [16a,16b] . The bridging Mn1\u2013N8\u2013Mn1A angle of 100.38(7)\u00b0 is smaller than that of homologous complexes (102.99, 103.23 and 104.6\u00b0) [16a,16b] . The crystal structure of this compound can be described as a 2D layer due to two types of intermolecular hydrogen bonds ( Fig. 2 ). One occurs between the CH N groups of L as proton donors and the nitrogen atoms of the terminal azide ligand with N6\u22efH8(\u2013C8) of 2.57 \u00c5 and N7\u22efH10(\u2013C10) of 2.53 \u00c5. The other happens between the hydroxyl of uncoordinated methanol molecules and the nitrogen atoms of the terminal azide ligand with N5\u22efH1(\u2013O1) of 1.96 \u00c5 and N6\u22efH1(\u2013O1) of 2.58 \u00c5. These intermolecular hydrogen bonds extend the structure into a 2D layer. Magnetic susceptibility Measurement of the molar magnetic susceptibility ( \u03c7 M ) and the effective magnetic moment ( \u03bc eff ) for 1 was performed in the temperature range 2\u2013300 K. Plots of \u03c7 M and \u03bc eff against temperature are shown in Fig. 3 . Variable-temperature susceptibility data was collected for 1 . The \u03bc eff value of 1 is 8.442 B.M. at room temperature. This value agrees well with that expected for the two spin-only Mn(II) ions ( S = 5/2) value 8.44 B.M. Upon cooling, the \u03bc eff value increases smoothly to maximum10.59 B.M. at 8 K, which suggests the presence of ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn II ions within this dinuclear complex. Below 8 K, \u03bc eff drops down sharply, reaching 9.93 B.M. at 2 K, which can be attributed to the zero-field splitting or/and weak intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction that are dominant at low temperature [19] . In order to understand quantitatively the magnitudes of the spin\u2013exchange interaction, its magnetic data was analyzed by the theoretical expression [16a,16b] (1) (1) \u03c7 M = 2 N \u03b2 2 g 2 KT A B \u03c7 M \u2032 = \u03c7 M / [ 1 - ( ZJ \u2032 / N \u03b2 2 g 2 ) \u03c7 M ] A = 55 + 30 exp ( - 10 J / KT ) + 14 exp ( - 18 J / KT ) + 5 exp ( - 24 J / KT ) + exp ( - 28 J / KT ) B = 11 + 9 exp ( - 10 J / KT ) + 7 exp ( - 18 J / KT ) + 5 exp ( - 24 J / KT ) + 3 exp ( - 28 J / 2 KT ) + exp ( - 30 J / KT ) J is the exchange coupling parameter describing the magnetic interaction between the Mn II ions, and other symbols have their usual meanings. Least-square fitting of all experimental data leads to J = 1.31 cm \u22121 , g = 1.98, ZJ \u2032 = \u22122.92 \u00d7 10 \u22122 cm \u22121 , with the agreement factor R = \u2211 ( \u03c7 obsd - \u03c7 calcd ) 2 / \u2211 \u03c7 obsd 2 = 6.11 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 . The fitting results confirm that the overall behavior of complex 1 corresponds to a ferromagnetic interaction mediated by the double end-on azide bridges. The magnetostructural correlation studies have shown a dependence of ferromagnetic exchange coupling parameter ( J ) on the M\u2013N(azide)\u2013M bridging angle \u03b8 . For complex 1 , the M\u2013N(azide)\u2013M bridging angle is 100.38(7)\u00b0 and J is 1.31 cm \u22121 . According to literature [10,16c] , the calculated J is \u22120.26 cm \u22121 . As what Karmakar has mentioned, the experiment value is different from the theoretical. This result stimulates us to investigate further studies to reduce the gap between the theoretical predictions and the experimental findings.

Obtained results indicated that spherical Ag grains with size of about 5 nm are highly dispersed on the surface of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. The surface area of the Ag/Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles is several times as large as that of pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The H 2 S sensing properties of these Ag/Fe 2 O 3 sensors were systematically investigated. In comparison with pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , all of the Ag-doped sensors showed better sensing performance in respect of response, selectivity and optimum operating temperature. The effects of Ag content, calcination and operation temperature on the sensing characteristics of the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors were also investigated. The sensor containing 2 wt% Ag and calcined at 400 \u00b0C exhibited the maximum response to H 2 S at 160 \u00b0C. A possible mechanism for the influence of Ag on the H 2 S-sensing properties of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors was proposed. Keywords Gas sensor Ag-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 H 2 S Low operating temperature 1 Introduction In recent years, the concern over environmental protection and increasing demands to monitor hazardous gases in industry and home has attracted extensive interests in developing gas sensors for various polluting and toxic gases. Due to the advantages of small size, low cost, simple operation and good reversibility, the semiconductor sensors have become the most promising devices among the solid-state chemical sensors. Hence, the metal oxide gas-sensing materials are widely investigated. Many semiconductor oxides such as SnO 2 , ZnO, Fe 2 O 3 , In 2 O 3 , WO 3 , and CuO, have been explored to detect the polluting, toxic and inflammable gases, such as CO, CO 2 , NO X , H 2 S, and ethanol [1\u20137] . Hematite (\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 ), the most stable iron oxide, is of scientific and technological importance as catalysts, pigments, ion exchangers, magnetic materials and lithium-ion batteries [8\u201311] . Recently, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 has been proved to be an important solid-state gas sensor. However, the low sensitivity, poor selectivity and high operating temperature discourage its extensive application. In order to fit the increasing demands of sensors in more complicated systems and strict conditions, many attempts have been made to improve the sensing properties of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . Based on the sensitization effects of noble metals on metal oxides through chemical and/or electronic interactions, modifying the base materials with noble metals is an efficient way to the base materials to promote their response towards various gases [12\u201316] . Up to now, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -based sensors have been investigated for the detection of some organic gases such as ethanol, acetone, methanol, and LPG [17\u201321] . However, there are few reports on the study of the gas sensing properties of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 to H 2 S. In our previous works, the effects of Au, Pd and Pt on the sensing properties of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to H 2 S have been investigated [22\u201324] . The gas sensing properties of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 were markedly promoted by doping with such noble metals. However, the high cost discourages their extensive application. Hence, it is important to search an alternative component to replace Au, Pd and Pt. Silver is probably a suitable one. In this paper, we reported for the first time the preparation of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors by a coprecipitation method. The structural properties of the prepared Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were characterized by means of XRD, TG-DTA, TEM, HRTEM, BET and XPS. The effects of Ag content, calcination and operating temperature on the gas sensing properties to H 2 S were investigated in detail. The sensing mechanism of the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to H 2 S was also discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 All the reagents are of analytical grade and used as purchased. Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were prepared by a coprecipitation method. A small quantity of polyglycol was added to an aqueous solution of AgNO 3 (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 wt%) and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O. The aqueous mixture was then added dropwise to an aqueous solution of Na 2 CO 3 under vigorous stirring at 80 \u00b0C. The pH of the solution was adjusted by a diluted Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution in the reaction process. After stirring for 1 h, a solid precipitate Ag/FeOOH was formed. After digesting the precipitate overnight at room temperature, it was washed with deionized water, dried at 80 \u00b0C and calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 1 h. Finally, a series of Ag-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powders with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 wt% Ag were obtained. 2.2 Characterization of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 Thermal analyses of the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powders were carried out on a ZRY-2P thermal analyzer. Ten milligrams of samples were heated from room temperature to 600 \u00b0C in air at a heating rate of 20 \u00b0C min \u22121 . X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a D/MAX-RAX diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm) operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a Philips-T20ST electron microscope, operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5600 spectrophotometer with Mg K\u03b1 radiation. The operating conditions were kept constant at 187.85 eV and 250.0 W. In order to subtract the surface charging effect, the C 1s peak has been fixed at a binding energy of 284.6 eV. The specific surface areas ( S BET ) of the samples were calculated following the multi-point Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) procedure on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature. 2.3 Fabrication and analysis of gas sensors The gas sensing behavior was investigated by using a commercial gas sensing measurement system of HW-30A from Henan Hanwei Electronical Technology Co., Ltd. An alumina substrate tube of 4 mm in length was used for the heater and sensing base. A small Ni\u2013Cr alloy coil was placed through the tube to supply the operating temperatures from 100 to 500 \u00b0C. Two platinum wires attaching to each gold electrode were used as electrical contacts. The schematic diagrams of the typical gas sensor and the measuring principle were shown in our previous publications [23,24] . The Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powders were mixed with terpineol to form a paste. The paste was then coated onto the outside surface of an alumina tube. In order to improve their stability and repeatability, the gas sensors were sintered at 300 \u00b0C for 10 days in air. The sensing properties of the sensors were tested in a chamber with a volume of 0.015 m 3 . The test gases were injected into the closed chamber by a microinjector. The sensitivity of the gas sensors was measured under a steady-state condition. The gas response S is defined as the ratio R a / R g , where R a and R g are the resistances measured in air and in a test gas, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Results of characterization Fig. 1 shows the TG-DTA curves of as-prepared Ag/FeOOH powders. A dramatic weight loss occurs around 100 \u00b0C, accompanied with an endothermic peak on the DTA curve, which may be due to the dehydration process of physically adsorbed water and the release of attached nitrates in the products. In the range of 200\u2013400 \u00b0C, another weight loss is observed, corresponding to an obvious exothermic peak around 300 \u00b0C on the DTA curve. It can be attributed to the reaction 2FeOOH \u2192 Fe 2 O 3 + H 2 O. There is no obvious weight loss peak above 400 \u00b0C on the TG curve, indicating that the hydroxide products have already been well crystallized. According to the TG-DTA results, we can safely conclude that perfect Ag/Fe 2 O 3 crystals can be obtained after calcined at 400 \u00b0C under air atmosphere. The typical XRD patterns of Ag/Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles calcined at 400 \u00b0C with different Ag content are shown in Fig. 2 . The diffraction patterns of the samples match perfectly with the standard \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 reflections (JCPDS No. 33-664). The sharp peaks indicate that the crystals of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 are perfect, which is in good agreement with the TG-DTA analysis results. The average size of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 particles, calculated by the Deby\u2013Scherrer formula, is 20 nm. When Ag content is low, no obvious Ag peaks presented, which may be due to the high dispersion of Ag particles on the surface of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The particles of Ag are too small to be identified by the conventional X-ray diffraction method. When Ag content increased to 5 wt%, the diffraction peaks attributed to Ag crystal phases appeared at 38.1\u00b0 and 44.3\u00b0, which indicates that Ag particles become bigger with the increase of Ag content. TEM and HRTEM images of 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 calcined at 400 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the morphology of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 particles is almost spherical. The diameter of the particle is about 30\u201350 nm, which is larger than the crystalline size obtained by XRD. That indicates the presence of polycrystallites because of the high temperature treatment. As is shown in Fig. 3 b, there are a few small spherical grains on the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 surface with the size about 5 nm, which may be the Ag nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to illuminate the surface composition of the studied Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. The spectra of Fe 2p and Ag 3d of 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 calcined at 400 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 4 . In Fig. 4 a, the bending energies of Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 are 710.7 and 724.3 eV, respectively, which is in well agreement with the literature values of Fe 3+ in \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 [25] . In Fig. 4 b, the peaks of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 are centered at 368.0 and 374.0 eV, respectively, which indicates that the state of Ag in the sample is metallic [26] . Surface elemental analysis reveals that the atomic ratio of Ag/Fe is 1/30. This value is higher than the theoretical one, which indicates that the Ag dopant is well dispersed on the surface of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The specific surface areas ( S BET ) of the undoped and Ag-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 with different Ag content were measured by N 2 -sorption analysis. As shown in Table 1 , the undoped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 has a small surface area (18.31 m 2 /g). After Ag is loaded, the surface area of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 can be promoted remarkably, and reaches the maximum (69.6 m 2 /g) when the content of Ag is 2 wt%. When the Ag content is larger than 2 wt%, the surface areas become to decrease unexpectedly. This should be attributed to the aggregation of Ag particles, resulting in the decrease of the surface area of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . Generally, a large BET surface area will lead to improvement of the sensing properties of the sensor. 3.2 Gas sensing properties It is well known that the gas sensitivity is greatly influenced by the operating temperature and the amounts of additives. In order to determine the optimum operating temperature and additive amount, the responses of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors calcined at 400 \u00b0C with different Ag content to 100 ppm H 2 S gas were measured at different operating temperatures. The response of an undoped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to H 2 S was also measured for comparison. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . It can be seen obviously from Fig. 5 that the undoped sensor has a poor response to H 2 S, while the doped sensors with different amounts of Ag all exhibit much higher responses than the undoped one. Among all the Ag-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors, the one with 2 wt% Ag shows the largest response to H 2 S. Whilst, the gas sensing property change trend is similar to the specific surface area change trend of the samples. Additionally, the responses of the sensors to H 2 S are also affected by the operating temperature. Each curve reveals a maximum response at an optimum operating temperature. The undoped sensor has the maximum gas response at 200 \u00b0C, whereas all the doped sensors have the maximum gas response at about 160 \u00b0C. The operating temperature of all the Ag-doped sensors is lower than that of the reported H 2 S sensors [27\u201330] . The lower operating temperature could lead to lower energy consumption, which is one of current pursuits in solid-state gas sensors. Based on the above results, we can see that the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors exhibit much better response and lower operating temperature than pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , and the optimum performance is obtained at 160 \u00b0C for the sensor of 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . Therefore, all further experiments were carried out using this particular composition (2 wt%) and operating temperature (160 \u00b0C) to explore the effect of other factors on the sensing performance of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 to H 2 S. Compared with our previously reported Au, Pt and Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors [22\u201324] , the gas sensitivity of our present prepared Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor is relatively lower than that of Pt-doped one, but a little higher than that of Au- and Pd-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . Since Ag is cheaper than Au, Pt and Pd, the present Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor system is worthy to further investigation. As generally mentioned earlier, the gas-sensing mechanism of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -based sensors belongs to the surface-controlled type, which is based on the change in conductance of the semiconductor. The oxygen adsorbed on the surface directly influences the conductance of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -based sensors. The amount of oxygen adsorbed on sensor surface depends on the operating temperature, particle size, and specific surface area of the sensor [31] . The state of oxygen on the surface of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor undergoes the following reaction [15] , (1) O 2 (gas) \u2192 O 2 (ads) (2) O 2 (ads) + e \u2212 \u2192 O 2 \u2212 (ads) (3) O 2 \u2212 (ads) + e \u2212 \u2192 2O \u2212 (ads) (4) O \u2212 (ads) + e \u2212 \u2192 O 2\u2212 (ads) The oxygen species capture electrons from the material, which results in the concentration changes of holes or electrons in the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 semiconductor. When the sensor is exposed to H 2 S, the reductive gas reacts with the oxygen adsorbed on the sensor surface. Then the electrons are released back into the semiconductor, resulting in the change in electrical conductance of the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor. It can be expressed in the following reaction, (5) H 2 S + 3O 2\u2212 \u2192 H 2 O + SO 2 + 6e \u2212 For the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors, the low response at low operating temperature can be attributed to the low thermal energy of the gas molecules, which is not enough to react with the surface adsorbed oxygen species. As a result, the reaction rate between them is essentially low [31,32] and low response is observed. On the other hand, the reduction in response after the optimum operating temperature may be due to the difficulty in exothermic gas adsorption at higher temperature [33] . Therefore, the maximum response can just be observed at the right operating temperature. The enhanced response of Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors can be attributed to two factors. First, the higher specific surface areas of the Ag-doped sensors can lead to an increase in active surface for gas sensing. Secondly, the Ag dopants, as a catalyst, enhance the adsorption of gas molecules and accelerate the electron exchange between the sensor and the test gas [34] . The two factors together contribute to the improvement of gas sensing properties of the Ag-doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors. Furthermore, the maximum response is observed for 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , perhaps due to the largest amount of active reaction sites formed by the random dispersion of Ag on the Fe 2 O 3 surface in this composition, as revealed by above BET analysis. The abrupt decrease of response for the sensors doped with more than 2 wt% Ag is probably due to the reduction of active sites correlated with the agglomeration of Ag grains [35] . In this paper, the effect of calcination temperature on the response of the as-prepared Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors to H 2 S is also investigated. Fig. 6 shows the variation of the responses of a series of 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors calcined at different temperatures to 100 ppm H 2 S. It can be seen that the calcination temperature has an obvious influence on the sensor response to H 2 S gas. The obtained results show that the response of the sensor to H 2 S is enhanced with the increase of calcination temperature from 200 to 400 \u00b0C, and the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor calcined at 400 \u00b0C has the highest response, being in good agreement with the TG-DTA results that 400 \u00b0C is the temperature at which the perfect \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanocrystallines can be obtained. But, the sample is amorphous FeOOH when calcined below 400 \u00b0C, and the gas sensing property of amorphous FeOOH is far worse than that of the crystalline \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . The responses of the sensor decrease gradually when the calcination temperature is higher than 400 \u00b0C, which may be due to an increase in the particle size. As a result, the 400 \u00b0C-calcined sensor which possesses a high surface area exhibits the highest response to H 2 S. Selectivity is another important parameter of a gas sensor. The sensor must have rather high selectivity for its application. Because \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -based sensors also respond to other gases, such as ethanol and acetone, the responses of our 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to other seven gases of 1000 ppm at different operating temperatures are also examined and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . From Fig. 7 , it can be seen clearly that the sensor exhibits the largest response to 100 ppm H 2 S, moderate responses to ethanol and acetone, and negligible responses to n -hexane, NH 3 , H 2 and CO even at such a high concentration (1000 ppm). On the other hand, the optimum operating temperature to ethanol and acetone is 200 \u00b0C, which is higher than that to H 2 S. The selectivity to H 2 S is good enough to detect H 2 S, especially when the operating temperature is in the range of 120\u2013160 \u00b0C. According to the experiment results, it is no problem to detect low concentration H 2 S at relatively low operating temperature. Furthermore, if there is no H 2 S in the atmosphere, the sensor can be used to monitor ethanol or acetone vapor at 200 \u00b0C. Response and recovery times are the basic parameters of gas sensors, which are defined as the time required to reach 90% of the final resistance. Rapid response and recovery to a target gas are demanded for practical application. Fig. 8 shows the typical response-recovery characteristics of the 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to different H 2 S concentrations (from 50 to 500 ppm). Corresponding response values of the sensor to these H 2 S concentrations are shown in the inset picture. As can be seen from Fig. 8 , the response of the 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor to H 2 S sharply increases with an increase in gas concentration. The response and recovery times to 50, 100, 200 and 500 ppm H 2 S are 68 and 35 s, 42 and 26 s, 31 and 25 s, 25 and 21 s, respectively. These times are short enough for practical application. The reversibility of the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors was also investigated. The sensors exhibited excellent responses to H 2 S even after several months. This indicates that the sensors possess excellent stability and reversibility. The Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensors should have a promising application to detect H 2 S and is worthy of further investigation. 4 Conclusions In summary, the Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by a convenient chemical coprecipitation method, and Ag/Fe 2 O 3 sensors were made and tested. The XPS analysis indicated that Ag existed in metallic form and highly dispersed on the surface of sensors. The specific surface area ( S BET ) of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanopowders was remarkably promoted by the Ag-doping. Compared with pure \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , the Ag-doped sensors showed much higher response, better selectivity and rather lower optimum operating temperature to H 2 S. Especially, the optimum performance was obtained at an operating temperature of 160 \u00b0C for the 2 wt% Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor calcined at 400 \u00b0C. The sensor could be used to detect H 2 S at the temperature range of 120\u2013160 \u00b0C and to detect ethanol and acetone at 200 \u00b0C. The doped sensor also presented long-term stability and relatively short response/recovery times. The Ag/\u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 sensor is a promising candidate for application in H 2 S monitoring at low-temperature.

The samples were characterized with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV\u2013Vis spectra. The morphology of the nanotubes was destroyed during the illumination process due to the high activity of titanate nanotubes and the existence of Pd/TiO 2 batteries. The photocatalytic activity of the samples for degradation of methyl orange solution was also studied, and high photocatalytic activity was observed. When palladium content was 1.5 wt.%, Pd/TiO 2 NFs showed the highest activity.",

        "abstract": "A novel, facile, and general one-pot strategy is explored for the synthesis of diverse noble-metal (Au, Pt, Ag, or Pt/Au)/Fe 2O 3 hybrid nanoparticles with the assistance of lysine (which is a nontoxic, user friendly amino acid that is compatible with organisms) and without using any other functionalization reagents. Control experiments show that lysine, which contains both amino and carboxylic groups, plays dual and crucial roles as both linker and capping agents in attaching noble metals with a small size and uniform distribution onto an Fe 2O 3 support. Considering the perfect compatibility of lysine with organism, this approach may find potentials in biochemistry and biological applications. Furthermore, this novel route is also an attractive alternative and supplement to the current methods using a silane coupling agent or polyelectrolyte for preparing hybrid nanomaterials. To demonstrate the usage of such hybrid nanomaterials, a chemical gas sensor has been fabricated from the as-synthesized Au/Fe 2O 3 nanoparticles and investigated for ethanol detection. Results show that the hybrid sensor exhibits significantly improved sensor performances in terms of high sensitivity, low detection limit, better selectivity, and good reproducibility in comparison with pristine Fe 2O 3. Most importantly, this general approach can be further employed to fabricate other hybrid nanomaterials based on different support materials. \u00a9 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

        "abstract": "A novel, facile, and general one-pot strategy is explored for the synthesis of diverse noble-metal (Au, Pt, Ag, or Pt/Au)/Fe(2)O(3) hybrid nanoparticles with the assistance of lysine (which is a nontoxic, user friendly amino acid that is compatible with organisms) and without using any other functionalization reagents. Control experiments show that lysine, which contains both amino and carboxylic groups, plays dual and crucial roles as both linker and capping agents in attaching noble metals with a small size and uniform distribution onto an Fe(2)O(3) support. Considering the perfect compatibility of lysine with organism, this approach may find potentials in biochemistry and biological applications. Furthermore, this novel route is also an attractive alternative and supplement to the current methods using a silane coupling agent or polyelectrolyte for preparing hybrid nanomaterials. To demonstrate the usage of such hybrid nanomaterials, a chemical gas sensor has been fabricated from the as-synthesized Au/Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles and investigated for ethanol detection. Results show that the hybrid sensor exhibits significantly improved sensor performances in terms of high sensitivity, low detection limit, better selectivity, and good reproducibility in comparison with pristine Fe(2)O(3). Most importantly, this general approach can be further employed to fabricate other hybrid nanomaterials based on different support materials.",

        "abstract": "A series of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0) powders were synthesized by co-precipitation method and the 8 wt.% CuO/Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts were prepared via deposition\u2013precipitation method. The samples were characterized by TG-DTA, XRD, XPS and TPR techniques. The influences of the proportion of TiO 2 and SnO 2 and calcination temperature on the catalytic activities of the catalysts were investigated. The CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 catalyst calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h showed the best catalytic performance. TPR analysis indicated that the addition of SnO 2 could improve the reducibility of the catalysts. The XPS measurement showed that the copper species were mainly dispersed as Cu 2+ ions. Keywords Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 CuO/Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts Low-temperature CO oxidation 1 Introduction The serious environmental implication of CO emission from automotive sources has stimulated a huge amount of pure and applied researches directed at catalytic abatement of such emission. TiO 2 used as a catalyst support has been received great attention because the catalyst supported on TiO 2 presents a relatively high catalytic activity, and TiO 2 is stable, inexpensive and innocuous [1\u20135] . Nevertheless, the increment of the catalytic efficiency of catalysts remains as an important goal. In order to further improve the performance of TiO 2 as a catalyst support, several structural and chemical modifications of this material have been assayed. In this way, significant increments of CO oxidation rate have been attained using either porous TiO 2 materials, or by the incorporation of noble metals into the TiO 2 lattice [6\u20139] . On the other hand, mixed oxides had received great attention in recent years. It has been realized that such systems may benefit from the combination of the best sensing properties of their pure components. The growing number of papers [10\u201315] reporting on the successful application of these oxides in practical works shows the important role they play in various research fields. Among them, Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 system has recently emerged as attractive materials for gas sensor and low-voltage varistor application [16\u201320] . Zakrzewska [16] reported that the operating temperature for hydrogen sensor was lowered to about 500 \u00b0C by addition of small amount of SnO 2 to TiO 2 lattice. Radecka\u2019s work [17,18] had showed that the response of SnO 2 sensors containing small additions of Ti was comparable with that of undoped SnO 2 , however the long-term stability was improved markedly. In addition, the use of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 system in environmental catalysis has also been examined because of it is high quantum yield and good photocatalytic activity. Lin [21] found that small Sn substitution for Ti in rutile TiO 2 increased the photoactivity of TiO 2 by 15 times for the oxidation of acetone. Compared to the experimental investigations, few systemic works have been reported on the studies of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 system used as a catalyst support for CO oxidation. Sermon and Walton have reported that Pt/TiO 2 \u2013SnO 2 (at higher TiO 2 contents) appeared to be a good catalyst for CO oxidation [22] . However, the optimum TiO 2 :SnO 2 balance for the ideal CO sensors was not assessed. Our previous work [26] has shown that the CuO/TiO 2 catalyst with 8 wt.% CuO loading exhibited higher catalytic activity than that of the catalysts with other CuO loadings. In this paper, a series of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 with different Ti/Sn ratio were prepared by co-precipitation method. The 8 wt.% CuO/Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts were prepared by deposition\u2013precipitation (DP) method. The samples have been characterized by TG-DTA, XRD, XPS and TPR. The catalytic activity in induction of CO oxidation was determined by a microreactor-GC system. For comparison, pure TiO 2 and SnO 2 were also prepared by the same method, and the catalytic performance of CuO/TiO 2 and CuO/SnO 2 was also studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 preparation Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 1) powders were prepared by the co-precipitation method. The mixed solution of Ti(SO 4 ) 2 and SnCl 4 \u00b7 5H 2 O together with the solution of ammonia were simultaneously dropped into a buffer solution (pH 8) under vigorous agitation, keeping the pH value of the solution at 8\u20139 during the precipitation process. After aging for 1 h, the resultant precipitate was filtered, washed with deionize water and then dried at 100 \u00b0C overnight. The obtained sample was calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h in air. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The 8 wt.% CuO/Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts were prepared by deposition\u2013precipitation (DP) method. At room temperature, 0.5 g Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 powders were suspended in the aqueous solution of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 3H 2 O (0.1316 g), then, 0.25 mol/L Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution was gradually added to the above suspended solution until the pH of the mixed solution reached 9.0. The mixture was stirred for another 1 h, then filtered and washed with distilled water. The resulting solid was dried at 80 \u00b0C for 4 h and subsequently calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h. 2.3 Catalyst characterization X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses were obtained from a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation (40 kV, 100 mA) and scanning in the region 2 \u03b8 = 3\u201380\u00b0. The average crystallite sizes were calculated from the peak width using Scherrer\u2019s equation. Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) were performed on a ZRY-2P thermal analyser. The thermograms were recorded from ambient temperature to 1173 K at a linear heating rate of 10 K/min under nitrogen atmosphere flowing at a rate of 40 cm 3 /min. \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 was used as reference. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI-1600 spectrometer (USA) equipped with a MgK\u03b1 radiation for exciting photoelectrons. X-ray source was operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and 250 W. The pressure in the ion-pumped analysis chamber was maintained at 8 \u00d7 10 \u221210 Torr during data acquisition. All binding energies (BE) were referenced to the adventitious C1s line at 284.6 eV (1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10 \u221219 J). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed under the mixture of 5% H 2 in N 2 flowing (30 cm 3 /min) over 0.1 g catalyst at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. Prior to TPR, the samples were treated in air at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min. The H 2 uptake amount during the reduction was measured by using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.4 Measurement of catalytic activity The catalytic activity measurements of the catalysts were carried out in a fixed bed flow microreactor (7 mm i.d.) under atmospheric pressure using 0.1 g catalyst powder. The airflow rate was 33.3 cm 3 /min, and the CO gas flow rate was 0.5 cm 3 min. The reactant and product composition were analysed on-line by a GC-508A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 TG-DTA analysis of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 The thermal behavior of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3) was investigated by TG-DTA, and the results were shown in Fig. 1 . The DTA curve of TiO 2 ( x = 1) ( Fig. 1 a) exhibits a endothermic event at about 100 \u00b0C, where a weight-loss occurred in its TG curve. This peak could be due to the elimination of adsorbed water. The broad and weak endothermic feature centered at 190 \u00b0C is attributed to the dehydroxylation process of surface-attached H 2 O and OH groups [23,24] . At the temperature higher than 500 \u00b0C, no significant weight loss was observed in the TG curve. The TG-DTA profile of the Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3) Fig. 1 b\u2013e is essentially similar to that observed for the TiO 2 ( x = 1), except the position and intensity of the endothermic peaks associated with the dehydroxylation process of surface-attached H 2 O and OH groups. The peaks deferred and became more and more broad and weak as the proportion of Sn increased. 3.2 XRD The XRD patterns of Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0), along with TiO 2 prepared by sol\u2013gel method (discussed before [26] ) used as reference, were displayed in Fig. 2 (all of the samples calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h). Both TiO 2 and Ti 0.7 Sn 0.3 O 2 had mostly amorphous character. The incomplete crystallization of these two samples might have been caused by inadequate time needed for better crystallization [27] . The XRD pattern of Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 corresponded to anatase structure (JCPDS PDF [28] card 21-1272), with a dominant 011 diffraction line at 2 \u03b8 = 25.01\u00b0. In contrast, Ti 0.5 Sn 0.5 O 2 and Ti 0.3 Sn 0.7 O 2 showed only reflections corresponding to rutile phase. No evidence of the presence of segregated SnO 2 was found in any of these samples. The results indicated that the incorporation of Sn facilitates the crystallization transformation as previously reported [20,29,30] . It was observed that the crystallite size calculated by Scherrers\u2019s equation increased with the increase of Sn content. The broad peaks on the XRD pattern of Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 indicated the crystallite diameter of the sample was very small (1.8 nm), whereas the crystallite diameter of Ti 0.5 Sn 0.5 O 2 was 2.2 nm, and Ti 0.3 Sn 0.7 O 2 was 3.2 nm. Oliveira [24] has reported the similar results which can signify that the presence of tin might be used to control the particle size of the oxides. 3.3 XPS The XP spectra of Cu2p binding energies for 8 wt.% CuO/TiO 2 , 8 wt.% CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 and 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 were shown in Fig. 3 . Obvious differences between the two catalysts can be seen from this figure. The binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 were 933.6 eV and 953.7 eV, respectively. This means that the copper species in 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 were mainly dispersed as Cu 2+ ions [31] . However, the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 binding energies of 8 wt.% CuO/TiO 2 and 8wt.% CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 were 934.3 and 954.3 eV, respectively. They were higher than that of 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 and shift at higher binding energy. This indicated that there was a charge transfer from the metal ion to the support oxide [32] . C\u00f3rdoba et al. [33] observed an analogous shift in the XP spectra of CuO/TiO 2 samples in which dispersed CuO species (933 eV) and those of -Cu\u2013O\u2013Ti\u2013O- (935 eV) have been recognized. The presence of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks along with their shakeup satellites confirmed further that copper exists as Cu 2+ ions [31,32] . 3.4 TPR In order to investigate the catalyst structures further, temperature-programmed reduction studies were performed. The typical TPR profiles of 8 wt.% CuO/TiO 2 , 8 wt.% CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 and 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 catalysts were shown in Fig. 4 . When temperature was below 400 \u00b0C, the TPR profiles of 8 wt.% CuO/TiO 2 showed mainly two reduction peaks at about 191 and 206 \u00b0C (marked \u03b1 3 and \u03b2 3 , respectively). Similarly, the TPR profiles of 8 wt.% CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 showed two overlapping peaks at about 164 and 179 \u00b0C (marked \u03b1 2 and \u03b2 2 , respectively). Compared with the two peaks in above two samples, there were three peaks at 150,196 and 216 \u00b0C (marked \u03b1 1 , \u03b4 1 and \u03b2 1 , respectively) in 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 catalyst. According to general interpretation [33,34] , the peaks \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 and \u03b1 3 could be attributed to the reduction of highly dispersed CuO (amorphous form) interacting with support strongly. This phase is highly dispersed and, by reduction, can generate isolated copper atoms, keeping a partial positive charge and regarded as the active sites for CO oxidation. The peaks \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 and \u03b2 3 should correspond to the reduction of larger CuO particles associated with the support. The peak \u03b4 3 in the 8 wt.% CuO/SnO 2 was attributed to the reduction of the highly dispersed SnO 2 . On the other hand, the TPR analyses showed that the reduction temperature of the CuO supported on Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 and SnO 2 was lower than that on TiO 2 , and the intensity of \u03b1 2 was much higher than that of \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 3 . This might be due to the synergistic effect between CuO and the support. The results were also conceivable that the added SnO have the synergistic ability in TiO 2 support and is promoting the reduction of CuO [25] . This may make the CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 catalysts have higher catalytic activity than CuO/TiO 2 and CuO/SnO 2 catalysts under the same reaction condition. 3.5 Catalytic activity for CO oxidation The catalytic activities of CuO/Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0) catalysts with different x value calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h were shown in Fig. 5 a. It displayed that all the catalysts supported on the binary composition had better catalytic performance than those supported on the pure composition TiO 2 and SnO 2 while the CuO/TiO 2 catalyst cannot reach complete conversion under the same experimental condition. The results were consistent with the TPR analysis which indicated that the addition of Sn improved the reducibility of the catalysts. Comparing with the performance of the catalysts prepared by Dong et al. [25] , our catalysts displayed higher catalysis activities for CO oxidation. On the other hand, it could be seen from Fig. 5 a that the temperature for 100% CO conversion ( T 100% ) of the samples with x = 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.3 were 170, 110, 130 and 160 \u00b0C, respectively. It is noted that the T 100% decreased with the decrease of the x value from 1 to 0.6, however, it increased when the x value decreased from 0.6 to 0. This indicated that the anatase crystal phase and smaller particle size of support were responsible for the superior catalytic property in the present study, which was in good agreement with the result of XRD analyse. For the purpose of comparison, the 8 wt.% CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 catalyst was selected to continue the following study. The influence of calcination temperature on the catalytic activity of the 8 wt.% CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation was investigated and the results were shown in Fig. 5 b. It can be seen that the T 100% of the sample calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 3 h was 180 \u00b0C and when the calcination temperature was 200 \u00b0C, the T 100% was 130 \u00b0C. Both of them were higher than the T 100% of the sample calcined at 300 \u00b0C ( T 100% = 110 \u00b0C). The results could be due to the fact that higher temperature resulted in sintering of the components, and lower temperature was unfavorable to the highly disperse of ion copper oxide and the interaction between copper oxide and the support [26] . 4 Conclusions Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0) were prepared by the co-precipitation method. The 8 wt.% CuO/Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts were prepared by deposition\u2013precipitation (DP) method. The XRD analysis indicated that the addition of SnO 2 could accelerate the anatase-rutile transformation of the crystal phase markedly, and the Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 was formed with lower crystallite size than the pure SnO 2 . The lower crystallite size of doped particles was attributed to CO oxidation. Among the prepared samples, Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 was in anatase structure and had the smallest particle size. The XPS measurement showed that the copper species were mainly dispersed as Cu 2+ ions on the support. The study of the catalytic activity for CO oxidation indicated that the catalytic activity of the CuO catalysts supported on the binary composition (Ti x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 ) was higher than that on the pure composition (TiO 2 and SnO 2 ), which might be due to the fact that the addition of SnO 2 lowered the reduction temperature of the CuO as revealed by TPR analyse. From the results of the catalytic activity measurements, we also found that the suitable proportion of TiO 2 and SnO 2 and calcination temperature of the catalysts were responsible for better catalytic activity. In our present work, the CuO/Ti 0.6 Sn 0.4 O 2 catalyst calcined at 300 \u00b0C for 3 h represented the best catalytic activity. References [1] M. Valden S. Paka X. Lai Catal.

        "abstract": "A novel sensor material of WO 3 supported Pt clusters hybrid material was synthesized, with control over the Pt loading content by simply varying the amount of H 2 PtCl 6 precursor. The as-prepared WO 3 supported Pt cluster composites were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. TEM images show that the Pt clusters with a fine size of ca. 2 nm are uniformly dispersed on WO 3 matrix. Gas sensing tests reveal that the Pt/WO 3 hybrid material with a Pt content of 2.36 wt% exhibits the best response towards ethanol detection at an operating temperature of 140 \u00b0C. The sensor also possesses fast response and recovery characteristics, good selectivity and stability. The enhanced sensor performance is interpreted in terms of the proper content, uniform dispersion and small size of Pt clusters, which probably have a strong spillover effect and can serve as active sites for sensing reactions and excellent channel for electron transfer in the process of sensing reactions. The electronic interaction between Pt clusters and WO 3 support is also believed to contribute to the improved sensor performance. Keywords Pt WO 3 Sensor Ethanol Response 1 Introduction Among various n-type metal oxide semiconductors, WO 3 has received considerable attention for use as chemical sensor because of its unique sensing properties for a series of target gases, including H 2 S [1\u20133] , NO x [4\u20136] , H 2 [7,8] , O 3 [9\u201312] , NH 3 [5,13,14] and volatile organic compounds (VOC) [15] . It is well known that the synthetic methods and composition of sensor materials have significant effects on their sensor performance. For instance, Cantalini et al. [10] have shown that the sensor based on WO 3 derived from sol\u2013gel method exhibited the best sensitivity towards O 3 , compared with sputtering and thermal evaporation techniques. In addition, to further improve the WO 3 sensor performance, the noble metal (NM) doping procedure has been established and extensively developed by many researchers. For example, Penza et al. [4] reported that superior NO x sensing performance for WO 3 sensors could be obtained by utilizing Au, Pd and Pt as the activator layers. Ippolito et al. [7] demonstrated that Pt and Au activated WO 3 sensors were approximately 161 and 40 times more sensitive to hydrogen than the non-activated WO 3 sensor, respectively. A previous work [16] from our group has also shown that Au has a substantial promotion effect on the WO 3 sensor properties for detecting NO 2 gas. For the popular NM-doped semiconductor sensors, it is widely accepted that the catalytic activity of NM is responsible for the enhanced sensor performance. However, in most of the above-referred works, the details of the existence of NM in WO 3 matrix, such as particle shapes, particle size and dispersion, are seldom reported. As well known, for NM to be effectively catalytic for reactions, take Au [17,18] for example, a particle size smaller than 5 nm is a prerequisite and uniform dispersion in support materials is also necessary. On the other hand, a clear knowledge of the existence of NM in support is undoubtedly helpful for one to reach a clear sensing mechanism. In the present work, a novel sensor material of WO 3 supported Pt clusters has been fabricated and systematically investigated by employing several familiar gases as the probe molecules. TEM images reveal that Pt clusters with a size of ca. 2 nm are uniformly dispersed on the surface of WO 3 support. Gas sensing tests show the Pt-decorated WO 3 sensor, with a doping content of 2.36 wt% as estimated by XPS, has the best sensitivity towards ethanol at 140 \u00b0C, as well as fast response and recovery times within 5 s, good selectivity and stability. The superior sensor performance in comparison with pure WO 3 probably is attributed to the proper content, fine size and uniform dispersion of Pt clusters, which probably have a strong spillover effect and can serve as active sites for sensing reactions and excellent nanochannels for electron transfer in the sensing process, and synergism between Pt and WO 3 . 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials All chemicals (analytical grade) used in this work were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute and used as received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiment. 2.2 Preparation of Pt-doped WO 3 This involves two steps. First, the WO 3 support was prepared as follows: Na 2 WO 4 \u00b72H 2 O was dissolved into a certain amount of deionized water, followed by the drop addition of 3 M HCl aqueous solution till no white precipitate formed. After being aged for 24 h, 60 mL of 0.15 M cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide aqueous solution (CTAB) was added, then the solution was subject to ultrasonication for 30 min. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water till no Cl \u2212 and Br \u2212 could be detected by 0.1 M AgNO 3 aqueous solution, and then dried at 80 \u00b0C overnight. To promote the crystallization of WO 3 , the precursor was calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 2 h, generating WO 3 powder with a yellow color. Secondly, a series of Pt-doped WO 3 with different Pt contents were synthesized by adding 0.5 g WO 3 into 10 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring. Then, 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 mL of 0.0077 M H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution was introduced into the WO 3 mix solution, followed by adding 1 M ammonia solution till the pH reached 8\u20139. After stirring for 1.5 h, the precipitate was centrifuged and washed with deionized water till no Cl \u2212 could be detected by 0.1 M AgNO 3 aqueous solution, then dried at 80 \u00b0C overnight. Pt-doped WO 3 powder was finally obtained by annealing the precursor at 300 \u00b0C for 2 h. The five Pt/WO 3 samples with different Pt contents were named as 0-PtW, 1-PtW, 2-PtW, 3-PtW and 4-PtW. 2.3 Characterization and gas sensing test The samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500, Cu K\u03b1, \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5), transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips FEI Tecnai 20ST, 200 kV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer, Al-K\u03b1 X-ray monochromator). The sensor fabrication and gas sensing tests have been in detail described in our previous works [19,20] . Gas sensing tests were performed on a HW-30A gas sensing measurement system (HanWei Electronics Co., Ltd., Henan Province, China) at a relative humidity (RH) of 20\u201340%. The sensor response is defined as the ratio of Ra / Rg , where Ra and Rg denote the sensor resistance in air and in test gas, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization The crystallite phase of the five samples was characterized by XRD and the patterns are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen that all samples show the same diffraction peaks, which can be indexed to orthorhombic WO 3 (JCPDS Card No. 20-1324). However, no diffraction peaks corresponding to Pt are present. This is probably caused by two reasons. One is the low content of Pt, 2.36 wt%, as determined by XPS. The other possible reason lies in the diffraction line broadening of Pt peaks, indicating that Pt should be highly dispersed in the WO 3 matrix with a very fine size, which is later approved by the TEM results shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 illustrates TEM images of the obtained Pt-supported WO 3 with different Pt contents (2-PtW and 3-PtW). As can be seen, numerous Pt clusters with a size of ca. 2 nm are anchored on the WO 3 matrix. These Pt clusters also present a uniform dispersion throughout the support, which should be very favorable for improving the sensor properties [21] . These fine Pt clusters can dissociate oxygen molecules due to the well-known spillover effect [13,21,22] , thus could serve as active sites to promote sensing reactions between WO 3 and target molecules. It should be mentioned that this has been the first report on the homogeneous dispersion of Pt clusters on WO 3 support, and most interestingly, the loading content of Pt can be facilely tuned by simply changing the addition amount of H 2 PtCl 6 precursor. From comparison between Fig. 2 a and d, it is obvious that the 3-PtW has more supported Pt clusters than the 2-PtW. To further confirm the existence of Pt in WO 3 matrix, XPS analysis was performed for 2-PtW. Fig. 3 shows the high-resolution spectra for W 4f, Pt 4f and O 1s. The binding energy (BE) of W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 was determined to be 35.3 and 37.3 eV, respectively with a \u0394 E of 2.0 eV, indicating the 6+ oxidation valence state of W [16,23] . Fig. 3 b shows that the BE of Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 is 72.1 and 76 eV, respectively which are not different from those of metallic Pt and Pt 4+ [24\u201326] , thus can be attributed to a mix oxidation state of Pt. The XPS pattern for O 1s ( Fig. 1 c) is fitted into two corresponding peaks with a BE of 530.1 and 531.6 eV. In a previous work, Dupin et al. [27] reported that O 2\u2212 and O \u2212 respectively had a BE in the range of 529.5\u2013530.5 and 531\u2013532 eV. For NM-doped metal oxides, a common phenomenon can usually be observed, i.e., the BE of NM shows a decrease or increase shift [28,29] . Previous publications have shown that the BE of Pt could be significantly affected by its chemical environment [24] or its physical size [30] . Furthermore, the strong electronic interaction between NM and metal oxide support [28,29] also has a large influence on the binding energy of species in the material. Most importantly, many works have claimed that the strong interaction between NM and metal oxide support plays a crucial role in enhancing the material property. In some other works related to NM-supported metal oxides, this kind of interaction is also named as \u201csynergy effect\u201d [25,29,31] , which is thought to be the reason for the large improvement in their chemical property. Based on the above discussion, a synergic interaction is expected to exit between Pt clusters and WO 3 support. It is therefore very necessary to examine whether the as-prepared Pt/WO 3 synergism has a potential for use as sensor material with advanced performance or not. 3.2 Sensor performance It is well known that the content of NM has a fundamental influence on the sensor performance, thus we first investigate the optimum Pt content by testing the five samples for detecting 100 ppm ethanol at various operating temperatures. Fig. 4 displays the five sensor responses as a function of temperature. It can be seen that different Pt contents result in large difference in the sensor responses. It shows that almost all the five samples exhibit the highest response to 100 ppm ethanol at ca. 140 \u00b0C, particularly the 2-PtW shows the best response with a value of 87.1, while the pure sensor (0-PtW) only possesses negligible response. This result demonstrates that the Pt additive shows a large promotion effect on sensor response, this promotion has also been reported for other Pt-doped metal oxide based sensors. Considering that the sensor based on 2-PtW shows the best response to 100 ppm ethanol at 140 \u00b0C, the sensor has been selected out for further gas sensing tests to investigate its response\u2013recovery time, selectivity and reproducibility. Fig. 5 displays the dynamic response\u2013recovery curves of the sensor based on 2-PtW and 0-PtW to 5, 50, 200 and 500 ppm ethanol at 140 \u00b0C. Obviously, the response amplitudes of 2-PtW to each ethanol concentration are much larger than those of 0-PtW, though their response times (<5 s) show no remarkable difference. The comparison between their responses is illustrated in Fig. 6 , indicating that the 2-PtW sensor has much higher responses than 0-PtW. The enhanced responses should be directly related to the decoration of Pt clusters, which could effectively catalyze the sensing reactions on the sensing layer. Such an enhanced sensor performance induced by Pt additives has also been reported by several researchers. For instance, Hub\u00e1lek et al. [32] showed that WO 3 with a Pt-loaded porous Al 2 O 3 layer exhibited a response of 4.2 higher than that (3.25) of pure WO 3 to 100 ppm ethanol at 300 \u00b0C. Srivastava and Jain [13] demonstrated Pt-doped WO 3 with a silica coating was quite advantageous for detecting ammonia, but the response to 160 ppm ethanol was lower than 2 at 450 \u00b0C. Alternatively, Labidi et al. [33] studied the Au doped WO 3 for ethanol sensing and found a response of 177 to 2% ethanol in comparison to 36 of pure WO 3 . To examine the selectivity of 2-PtW, the sensor has been tested to other six gases (concentration: 5 ppm). Their sensor responses are compared in Fig. 7 , revealing that the 2-PtW sensor exhibits the best response to ethanol with a value of 10.6, while the response value to other gases does not exceed 5. Reproducibility is another important characteristic for a sensor to be reliable and applicable for practical use. We have investigated the stability of the 2-PtW sensor by repeating the sensing test for 5, 50, 200 and 500 ppm ethanol at 140 \u00b0C after a period of 3 weeks. The result is present in Fig. 8 . Compared with its initial response\u2013recovery curves in Fig. 5 , it can be seen that the response times and amplitudes do not change very much, implying the good stability of the sensor. 3.3 Sensing mechanism Above results have shown that the sensor response has been significantly improved by Pt clusters. NM such as Au, Ag, Pt and Pd has been widely used to enhance the sensor properties, to interpret the improvement in sensor performance, two common reasons are referred. One is related to the spillover effect [13,21,22] of NM, which has been reported by many researchers, suggesting that the NM supported on metal oxide could promote the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen species, and thus promote the reactions happening at the interface between NM and metal oxide support. Our TEM images have clearly shown that the Pt clusters with an average size of ca. 2 nm are highly dispersed on WO 3 , which is very beneficial for oxygen spillover, thus facilitate the sensing reaction between target gas and oxygen species. A second reason refers to the electronic interaction between NM and support. Previous works have demonstrated this interaction based on XPS analysis, because the BE of NM usually has a negative or positive shift [28,29] , which is attributed to the electron transfer between NM and support. In this manner, it is believed that the Pt clusters can serve as active sites for sensing reactions and act as excellent nanochannels for electron transfer from reducing gases to n-type semiconductor. 4 Conclusions In summary, a novel WO 3 supported Pt cluster hybrid material has been successfully synthesized. The Pt clusters are uniformly dispersed on WO 3 matrix. Furthermore, the Pt loading content can be tuned by simply varying the amount of H 2 PtCl 6 precursor. Most importantly, the as-prepared WO 3 supported Pt cluster hybrid material (2-PtW) with a Pt content of 2.36 wt% exhibits the best response towards ethanol detection at an operating temperature of 140 \u00b0C. In addition, the sensor also shows fast response and recovery characteristics, selectivity and stability. The enhanced sensor performance is attributed to the uniform dispersion and small size of Pt clusters, which probably have a strong spillover effect and can serve as active sites for sensing reactions and excellent nanochannels for electron transfer in the sensing process. The electronic interaction between Pt clusters and WO 3 support is also believed to contribute to the improved sensor performance.

Prepared materials are characterized with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), UV\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy and BET, etc. The gold-modified TiO 2 nanotubes prepared via various procedures exhibit distinct difference in structure. By impregnation\u2013reduction approach, gold-modified TiO 2 nanotubes with large gold particles are fabricated. The gold particles are either deposited on or encapsulated in TiO 2 nanotubes. However, by using gold hydrophilic colloidal dispersion as gold precursor, gold particles in the modified TiO 2 nanotubes are very small. Gold particles only adhere to the outer surface of TiO 2 nanotubes after deposition process, whereas adhere to not only the outer but also the inner walls of TiO 2 nanotubes after direct assembly process. A possible mechanism is proposed to illustrate the formation of gold-modified nanotubes that are prepared by direct assembly process.",

        "abstract": "Tin dioxide nanocrystals were synthesized by a precipitation process and then used as the support for 2 wt.% gold/tin dioxide preparation via a deposition\u2013precipitation method, followed by calcination at 200 \u00b0C. Thick films were fabricated from gold/tin dioxide powders, and the sensing behavior for carbon monoxide gas was investigated. The gold/tin dioxide was found to be efficient carbon monoxide gas-sensing materials under low operating temperature (83\u2013210 \u00b0C). The Au/SnO 2 sensor with SnO 2 calcined at 300 \u00b0C exhibited better CO gas-sensing behavior than the SnO 2 calcined at other temperatures. The experimental results indicated the potential use of Au doped SnO 2 for CO gas sensing. Keywords Low-temperature carbon monoxide sensors Gold/tin dioxide Deposition\u2013precipitation method 1 Introduction Carbon monoxide is one of the most common and dangerous pollutants present in the environment due to emissions from automated vehicles, aircraft, natural gas emission, industrial wastage, sewage leaking, mines, etc. Its poisonous effects on human life are well-known. Therefore, a CO gas sensor is needed to prevent CO poisoning in homes or factories, and it has attracted a great deal of attention. Low-power consumption is an important feature for the sensor operation. At the present time, there have been quite a few commercially available solid-type CO gas sensors which can be widely used in various circumstances. However, these CO gas sensors have often had relatively high operating temperature, e.g., higher than 400 \u00b0C [1\u20133] . Therefore, the CO gas sensor operated at a relatively low temperature has been necessary. In order to overcome this problem, much effort has been made to develop new types of CO gas sensors with low-power consumption. Several metals have been used as sensitizing additives in order to enhance the CO sensitivity. Palladium (Pd), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt) and gold (Au) are the most common metal additives that are used to improve the gas-sensing properties of the semiconductor gas sensors [4,5] . However, there is still a primary challenge in attempting to meet the needs of low-power consumption and high sensitivity of CO gas sensor meanwhile. The dope of Au might be a promising method in decreasing the operating temperature of CO gas sensor. In this paper, we report the preparation and CO sensing behavior of the Au/SnO 2 composite powders, and also report the effect of the calcination temperature of SnO 2 on the CO gas-sensing behavior on the Au/SnO 2 thick-film sensors. 2 Experimental SnO 2 powders were synthesized by a precipitation process using SnCl 4 \u00b7 5H 2 O (A.R.) and NH 4 OH (A.R.). Under vigorous stirring, 1 mol/L NH 4 OH aqueous solution was added drop-wise to a 0.25 mol/L SnCl 4 solution until the pH of the solution was 7. The resulting suspension was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol alternatively until Cl \u2212 could not be examined by 0.1 mol/L AgNO 3 aqueous solution, and then the sample was dried overnight in air at 353 K. The as-prepared material was ground and calcined in air at 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 \u00b0C for 3 h. Two wt.% Au/SnO 2 powders were prepared by a deposition\u2013precipitation method. Under vigorous stirring, SnO 2 powders were dispersed in HAuCl 4 solution. Over a period of 1 h, 1 mol/L NH 4 OH aqueous solution was added drop-wise to the above resulting slurry under vigorous stirring until the pH of the slurry was 10. The mixture was stirred for another an hour, then filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol alternatively. The samples were dried at room temperature for 2 h in air, followed by calcination at 200 \u00b0C in air for 3 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on D/MAX-RAX diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 100 mA, using CuK\u03b1 radiation (scanning range 2 \u03b8 : 20\u201375\u00b0). Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. Alumina substrate tube with 4 mm length was used for the heater and sensing base. The Au/SnO 2 powders were mixed with deionized water, and then were coated onto alumina tube attached with Pt electrodes. The schematic diagram of a typical gas sensor is shown in Fig. 1 . Subsequently, the thick-film of sensing material was sintered at 200 \u00b0C for a week in air. The gas-sensing behavior was investigated by using the commercial gas-sensing measurement system of HW-30A. The measurement was carried out at various concentrations at the range of operating temperature from 83 to 210 \u00b0C. The sensitivity (Sr) was defined as the ratio of the sensor resistance in air ( R a ) to that in a sample gas ( R g ). The response and recovery times was obtained by the time for 90% of total sensitivity change. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 showed the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared SnO 2 samples calcined at different temperatures. Compared to JCPDS (file no. 41\u20131445) standard pattern, the peaks agreed well with tetragonal rutile crystalline structure of SnO 2 crystal, with no additional lines belonging to other phases such as SnO, i.e. observed in any of the X-ray diffraction patterns. This indicated that the increase of calcination temperature did not cause the transformation of lattice structure of SnO 2 . With the increase of calcination temperature, the intensity of diffraction peaks of [1 1 0], [1 0 1], [2 1 1] crystal faces gradually increased, and diffraction peaks of [2 0 0], [2 2 0], [0 0 2], [3 1 0], [3 0 1] crystal faces were gradually visible. This showed that crystalline structure of SnO 2 tended towards integrity. From the information provided by XRD patterns, we could see that the characterization diffraction peaks of the samples were apparently broad at low temperature (<400 \u00b0C), showing that the small-sized nanocrystalline SnO 2 was obtained. At the same time, with the increase of calcination temperature, the characterization diffraction peaks of SnO 2 became more and more sharp, indicating the particle size of SnO 2 increased. The average diameters of particles treated at different temperature were calculated by using Scherrer\u2019s equation based on the XRD peak broadening analysis at the (1 1 0) peak and listed in Table 1 . In this study, we examined the effect of calcination temperature of SnO 2 and operating temperature on CO gas-sensing behavior under different concentrations. It is clear that the sensitivity of Au/SnO 2 sensor to CO gas showed good dependence on the operating temperature and gas concentration. At the same operating temperature, the sensitivity of Au/SnO 2 sensor to CO gas sharply increased with the increase of CO gas concentration from 100 to 4000 ppm. At the same CO gas concentration, the sensitivity of Au/SnO 2 sensor to CO gas increased with the increase of operating temperature from 83 to 210 \u00b0C. The sensors were much more sensitive to CO gas at 160 and 210 \u00b0C than at 83 and 100 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 3 , the calcination temperature of SnO 2 also had an obvious influence on the sensitivity to CO gas. The Au/SnO 2 sensor with SnO 2 calcined at 300 \u00b0C exhibited the higher sensitivity to CO gas than SnO 2 calcined at other temperature. The XRD results ( Fig. 2 ) indicated that crystalline structure tended towards integrity and the particle size of SnO 2 increased with the increase of calcination temperature. The interaction between gold and support is of substantial importance in the case of CO oxidation. The smaller SnO 2 nanoparticles may supply more active sites and contribute to the strong interaction between gold and nanocrystalline SnO 2 . Therefore, the CO gas-sensing behavior of Au/SnO 2 sensor with SnO 2 calcined at 300 \u00b0C was better as compared with that of SnO 2 calcined above 400 \u00b0C. On the other hand, the degree of crystallinity of the support also brought markedly influence on the catalytic activity. Therefore, the Au/SnO 2 sensor with SnO 2 calcined at 300 \u00b0C was more active than the Au/SnO 2 sensor with SnO 2 calcined at 200 \u00b0C. We suggested that the CO gas-sensing behavior of Au/SnO 2 sensor was related to both the particle size and the degree of crystallinity of tin dioxide. Fig. 4 a\u2013d shows the typical isothermal response curves to CO gas on the Au/SnO 2 sensors with SnO 2 calcined at 300 \u00b0C at the operating temperature of 83\u2013210 \u00b0C. As seen in Fig. 4 , different response curves were observed at different operating temperature. At the same operating temperature, the response curves were similar to different CO concentration. At the different operating temperature, the response curves were obvious different to the same CO concentration. The response and recovery had a dependence on the operating temperature. At the same gas concentration, the time of response and recovery to CO gas decreases with the increase of operating temperature. The response and recovery times to 500 ppm CO gas at the operating temperature of 83, 100, 160 and 210 \u00b0C were 71 and 58 s, 36 and 30 s, 13 and 12 s, 8 and 6 s, respectively. These times are short enough for practical use. The stability of the sensors was also investigated. The sensors still had good response even after one month. We believe that CO gas sensors based on Au/SnO 2 might have promising applications in the future. 4 Conclusion We have observed that the gold/tin dioxide was found to be efficient carbon monoxide gas-sensing materials under low operating temperature (83\u2013210 \u00b0C). The Au/SnO 2 sensor with SnO 2 calcined at 300 \u00b0C exhibited better CO gas-sensing behavior than the SnO 2 calcined at other temperatures. The experimental results indicated the potential use of Au doped SnO 2 for CO gas sensing. Acknowledgement The financial support from 973 Program (2005CB623607) is acknowledged. References [1] J.-H.

        "abstract": "Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 mixed oxide was synthesized by a co-precipitation method and used as a support for a series of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS and H 2 -TPR. Their catalytic properties were studied by using a microreactor-GC system. The results indicated that the CuO loadings and calcination temperature had a large influence on the catalytic activity of the catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. The catalyst with 7 wt% CuO loading calcined at 650 \u00b0C for 4 h exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Combined with the XRD, XPS and TPR results, we suggest that the surface copper species and the synergetic effect in the system of Cu\u2013Ce\u2013Sn\u2013O are responsible for the catalytic activity of the catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation. Keywords CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts Co-precipitation method Low-temperature CO oxidation 1 Introduction Catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide is one of the effective treatments in environmental pollution control. Many studies have shown that noble metal catalysts have high catalytic activities for low-temperature CO oxidation [1\u20138] . However, the high cost and their sensitivity to sulfur poisoning have limited their application and stimulated the search for substitute catalysts [9\u201311] . In recent years, the studies of CO oxidation have been focused on transition metal oxides. Copper oxide catalysts, such as CuO/CeO 2 [12,13] and CuO\u2013CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 [14] , exhibited favorable catalytic activities. CeO 2 is known to be used for increasing the thermal stability of the metal oxide support, promoting low-temperature water\u2013gas shift [15] and stabilizing the noble metal dispersion. The high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of cerium is the most important property. Its redox couple Ce 4+ /Ce 3+ makes more oxygen available for the oxidation reactions [16] . However, pure CeO 2 is reported to have poor thermal stability [17] . To improve the property of ceria, zirconia is widely used in ceria-related catalysts. The ceria\u2013zirconia mixed oxides have shown better resistance to thermal ageing, and better redox property compared to pure CeO 2 [18\u201320] . SnO 2 has been widely used as an oxidation catalyst as it can reversibly undergo the Sn 4+ \u2194 Sn 2+ reaction at relatively lower temperature [21,22] . Many workers have studied the mixed oxides systems of CeO 2 and SnO 2 . Sasikala et al. [22] have researched the reduction behavior of Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 and Ce 0.3 Sn 0.7 O 2 and observed that the reduction of the mixed oxides at low temperature was improved obviously compared to the constituent oxides. Recently, Chen et al. [23] have studied the catalytic behavior of the CuO/Ce x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts and concluded that incorporating Sn into CeO 2 could improve the redox properties of the catalysts for the selective oxidation of CO. In this work, the Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 mixed oxide was prepared via a co-precipitation method using Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 6H 2 O and SnCl 2 \u00b7 2H 2 O and used as a support for CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). The effects of CuO loadings and calcination temperature on the catalytic activity were also investigated. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation The Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 mixed oxide was prepared by co-precipitation. Cerium nitrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 6H 2 O) and tin chloride dihydrate (SnCl 2 \u00b7 2H 2 O) were dissolved in a dilute HCl solution to give the final concentrations of 0.08 mol/L Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 6H 2 O and 0.02 mol/L SnCl 2 \u00b7 2H 2 O. Then 2 mol/L NH 3 \u00b7 H 2 O was added to the above solution under vigorous stirring until pH was 9. The solution was centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol alternatively until Cl \u2212 could not be examined by 0.1 mol/L AgNO 3 aqueous solution. The sample was dried at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h, and then calcined at 650 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. The CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 3H 2 O and the prepared Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 support. The samples were dried overnight at 80 \u00b0C and then calcined at 400, 500, 650 and 800 \u00b0C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The CuO loadings were 1, 4, 7, 10, 15 and 20 wt%. For comparison, 7 wt% CuO/CeO 2 and 7 wt% CuO/SnO 2 catalysts were also prepared in a similar manner. 2.2 Catalysts characterization X-ray power diffraction (XRD) analyses were examined on a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation (40 kV, 100 mA) and scanning in the region 2 \u03b8 = 20\u201390\u00b0. Diffraction peaks of crystalline phases were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Data File. The particle sizes were calculated using Debye\u2013Scherrer formula. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with Al K\u03b1 X-ray source ( h\u03bd = 1486.6 eV), hybrid (magnetic/electrostatic) optics and a multi-channel plate and delay line detector (DLD). All binding energies (BE) were referenced to the adventitious C1s line at 285 eV. The atomic ratio on the surface of the sample was calculated. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiment was carried out under a mixed gas flow rate of 5% H 2 in N 2 . The flow rate was 20 mL min \u22121 over 0.05 g catalyst. The catalyst bed was heated to 1000 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . Prior to TPR, the samples were treated in air at room temperature for 30 min. The H 2 uptake amount during the reduction was measured by using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.3 Catalytic activity measurement All catalytic activity tests of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts were performed in a continuous fixed-bed flow microreactor, using 200 mg catalyst powder. The air flow rate was 33.3 mL/min and the CO gas flow rate was 3.3 mL/min. The reaction temperature was measured using a thermocouple projecting into the catalyst bed. The space velocity ( F / W ) was 11,000 mL h \u22121 g \u22121 . The effluent gases were analyzed online by a GC-900A gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts with various CuO loadings calcined at 650 \u00b0C for 4 h. For comparison, the XRD pattern of CuO/CeO 2 catalyst is also shown in Fig. 1 . The diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 28.5\u00b0, 33.1\u00b0 and 47.5\u00b0 in the XRD patterns of all the samples corresponded to the cubic fluorite structure of CeO 2 . However, weak SnO 2 peaks at 2 \u03b8 26.5\u00b0 and 51.8\u00b0 were also observed. Sasikala et al. [22] have reported that the low intensity of SnO 2 peaks was due to its poor crystallinity. The particle sizes of the supports of 7 wt% CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 and 7 wt% CuO/CeO 2 were about 12.61 and 17.31 nm. Due to the fact that the ionic radius of Sn 4+ (0.71 \u00c5) was smaller than that of Ce 4+ (1.03 \u00c5), the grain size of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 was smaller than that of CuO/CeO 2 . This may indicate that most of SnO 2 is incorporated into the cell of CeO 2 . Furthermore, we could find from Fig. 1 that there was no visible reflection characteristic of CuO crystal phase when CuO loading was lower than 7 wt%, which indicated that CuO was well dispersed on the surface of Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 . But when CuO loading exceeded 7 wt%, the reflections attributed to CuO (2 \u03b8 = 35.5\u00b0, 38.7\u00b0) appeared, indicating the formation of bulk CuO phase. The intensity of the peaks became stronger and stronger when the CuO loading increased from 10 to 20 wt%, which may be due to the aggregation of bulk CuO on the surface of the support. The XRD patterns of 7 wt% CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures for 4 h are presented in Fig. 2 . It could be seen that there were no peaks assigned to CuO crystal phase when the calcination temperature was below 650 \u00b0C, indicating that CuO was well dispersed on the surface of Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 . However, when the calcination temperature increased to 800 \u00b0C, we could find two small peaks characteristic of CuO at 2 \u03b8 = 35.5\u00b0, 38.7\u00b0. In addition, as the calcination temperature increased, the peaks became narrower and sharper, indicating that the particle sizes of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts became larger and larger. To analyze the surface composition and elemental oxidation states, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed and the XPS spectra of O 1s, Ce 3d, Cu 2p and Sn 3d of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3 . From Fig. 3 a, we could find that O 1s spectrum contained two main peaks. The peak of higher binding energy at 531.3 eV was assigned to the absorbed oxygen, while the peak of lower binding energy at 529.8 eV was assigned to lattice oxygen. The Ce 3d XPS spectrum presented six peaks at about 916.2, 907.5, 900.4, 899.3, 888.3 and 882.2 eV as shown in Fig. 3 b. This is in agreement with the result reported by Zhang et al. [24] , which indicated that the valence of cerium in the mixed oxide was +4. There were no peaks assigned to Ce 3+ in Fig. 3 b. Fig. 3 c presents the XPS spectrum of Cu 2p. The peaks of Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 were centered at 933.6 and 952.8 eV, respectively. Kundakovic and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos [25] reported that the binding energy of 933.0\u2013933.8 eV for the Cu 2p 3/2 and the shake-up peaks were characteristic of CuO, while to lower binding energy (932.2\u2013933.1 eV) and the absence of shake-up peaks were characteristic of reduced copper species. The presence of the main peak at 933.6 eV and the satellite peak indicate that the copper species in the catalysts is CuO. The Sn 3d spectrum of the samples is shown in Fig. 3 d. The peaks centered at 486.2 and 494.6 eV represent the spectra of Sn 3d 5/2 and Sn 3d 3/2 , which are assigned to SnO 2 [26,27] . The surface composition of the catalysts was also studied by XPS. The results showed that the atomic ratio of Cu/(Cu + Sn + Ce) (0.24) on the surface was considerably higher than that in the bulk (0.14) of the catalyst, which indicated that the copper oxide species were highly dispersed on the surface of the catalysts. This is in good agreement with XRD analysis. H 2 -TPR profile of the CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalyst calcined at 650 \u00b0C for 4 h is shown in Fig. 4 . Rao et al. [28] reported that pure CuO showed a single reduction peak at 380\u2013392 \u00b0C and pure CeO 2 showed two reduction peaks at 500 and 800 \u00b0C. While CuO supported on CeO 2 showed a two-step reduction at much lower temperatures due to the fact that finely dispersed CuO strongly interacted with ceria (130\u2013175 \u00b0C) and larger CuO particles weakly associated with ceria (180\u2013200 \u00b0C). From Fig. 4 , two reduction peaks at about 158.4 and 243.3 \u00b0C in the low-temperature region and a broad reduction peak at 496.9 \u00b0C could be obviously observed. Based on the above reports, the peak at 158.4 \u00b0C can be attributed to the reduction of CuO finely dispersed on the surface of support and the peak at 243.3 \u00b0C to the reduction of bulk CuO and Sn 4+ species on the surface of supports. The peak at 496.9 \u00b0C can be assigned to the reduction of bulk SnO 2 and surface Ce 4+ and the peak at 810.5 \u00b0C is due to the high temperature reduction of bulk CeO 2 [29] . 3.2 Catalytic activity evaluation The catalytic activities of the catalysts with various CuO loadings are shown in Fig. 5 . It could be seen from Fig. 5 that the light-off temperatures for 110% CO conversion ( T 100 ) of all the catalysts were below 100 \u00b0C. However, the catalytic activities of pure CuO and Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 were much lower (not shown in Fig. 5 ). This indicates that there is a synergistic effect between CuO and Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 , which is responsible for the high CO oxidation catalytic activity. The T 100 of the catalysts with 1, 4, 7, 10, 15 and 20 wt% CuO loading were about 110, 100, 75, 75, 75 and 110 \u00b0C, respectively. Chen et al. [23] have reported the CuO/Ce x Sn 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts for selective oxidation of CO and pointed out that the T 100 of the 7 wt% CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalyst was 90\u201395 \u00b0C. In our present condition, we could find that the optimum CuO loading was 7 wt% and the T 100 was 75 \u00b0C, which exhibited the highest catalytic activity. When CuO loading was below 7 wt%, the catalytic activity increased with the increase of CuO loading. But when CuO loading was higher than 7 wt%, the catalytic activity did not increase and even decreased, which may be due to the formation of bulk CuO. This is in good agreement with the XRD results. The above results indicate that the CuO loading has much influence on the catalytic activity of the samples. When CuO loading is in an appropriate region, it can promote the oxidation of CO. However, when CuO loading exceeds a definite value, the additional copper forms bulk CuO, which has a reverse effect on the catalytic activity [30] . For comparison, Fig. 6 shows the catalytic activities of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 , CuO/CeO 2 and CuO/SnO 2 catalysts with 7 wt% CuO loading for low-temperature CO oxidation. From Fig. 6 , it could be found that the CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalyst displayed the highest catalytic activity ( T 100 = 75 \u00b0C), while the catalytic activity of CuO/SnO 2 catalyst was the lowest, which could not reach 100% conversion until the temperature increased to 190 \u00b0C. The T 100 of CuO/CeO 2 catalyst was 120 \u00b0C. The results indicate that incorporating Sn into CeO 2 can promote the redox properties. This is probably because there is a synergetic effect in Ce\u2013Sn mixed oxide, the effect can enhance the reducibility of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ , and therefore decrease the conversion temperature of CO oxidation. Fig. 7 shows the catalytic activities of 7 wt% CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts calcined at different temperatures for 4 h. From Fig. 7 , it was clear that the catalytic activities increased with the increase of the calcination temperatures from 400 to 650 \u00b0C. The catalyst calcined at 650 \u00b0C exhibited the highest catalytic activity and the T 100 of the catalyst was 75 \u00b0C. When the calcination temperature increased to 800 \u00b0C, the catalytic activity decreased. This may be due to the sintering of the CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalyst at high temperature and the formation of bulk CuO, which may have a negative effect on the catalytic activity. 4 Conclusions The CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation and tested for the CO oxidation at low temperature. From the experimental results, the following conclusions can be summarized: (1) The XRD and TPR results showed that the catalytic activities of the catalysts depended on the finely dispersed copper oxide on the surface of the support. The XPS analysis indicated that the valence of cerium in the mixed oxide was +4, and the copper species in the catalysts was CuO. Furthermore, XPS analysis also indicated that the copper oxide species was enriched on the surface of the support. (2) From the catalytic activity tests, we could see that the catalytic behavior of CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 system was obviously influenced by CuO loading and the calcination temperature. The CuO (7 wt%)/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalyst calcined at 650 \u00b0C for 4 h exhibited the highest catalytic activity among all of the prepared catalysts. Moreover, the study results showed that the catalytic activity of the CuO/Ce 0.8 Sn 0.2 O 2 catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation was higher than that of CuO/CeO 2 and CuO/SnO 2 . This might be due to the synergetic effect in Ce\u2013Sn mixed oxide, which enhanced the reducibility of the catalysts.

Graphical Abstract HRTEM images of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres. Keywords Acetone sensor \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres Synthesis Characterization 1 Introduction As an environmentally friendly n-type semiconductor, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 has been proven to be a good gas sensitive material for detection of toxic, combustible, explosive and harmful gases in both domestic and industrial applications. Extensive studies have been done to improve the gas sensing performances of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 based sensor, such as adding promoters, doping additives, decreasing grain size, controlling pore and surface defects, etc. [1] . It is well-known that the shape and size of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 have a significant influence on its gas sensing properties. \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanostructures with different morphologies have been successfully synthesized, including nanorods [2,3] , nanotubes [4] , nanowires [5] and hollow microspheres [6\u20138] . Some recent research has indicated that using carbon microspheres as templates to synthesize hollow microspheres is a simple but efficient approach. Up-to-date, several metal oxides, including WO 3 , Ga 2 O 3 , SnO 2 , TiO 2 , had been fabricated through carbon sphere template process [9,10] . As a novel green template, in comparison with polymer or silica microspheres, carbon microspheres have one apparent feature: there are a number of hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) on the surface, which makes surface modification unnecessary. As a chemical reagent, acetone is extensively applied in industry, but its easy volatilization and toxic nature make it dangerous to people at high concentration in air. It may cause a headache, fatigue, nausea, even narcosis and death with the concentration of acetone in air higher than 1000 ppm. High concentration acetone vapor will also have a bad influence on the function of kidney and liver. Thus, detecting and measuring acetone in the workplace is necessary for human\u2019s safety and health. In addition, acetone has been related to diabetes. The medical reports show that the average concentration of acetone in the breath products exhaled by diabetic patients and their blood is higher than that of healthy people [11,12] . The validity of acetone detection for diabetes diagnostics has been supported by extensive medical researches [13,14] . Therefore, sensor may be one of the most promising methods in measuring the concentration of acetone, due to its simplicity, precision and convenience. In this paper, we develop a simple and efficient template approach to fabricate \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres using carbon microspheres as templates and investigate the gas sensing behavior of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres towards acetone vapor. 2 Experimental All chemicals in this work were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. 2.1 Preparation of carbon microspheres Carbon microspheres were prepared in a typical procedure. 7.2 g glucose was dissolved in 80 ml distilled water to get a clear solution and then hydrothermal treatment at 160 \u00b0C for 6 h. The precipitate was centrifuge-rinsed with distilled water and ethanol for several times till getting the clear solution, and then dried at 80 \u00b0C in air for 12 h. 2.2 Preparation of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres The synthesis process of porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres was as follows: 0.5030 g carbon microspheres were uniformly dispersed in 100 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) by ultrasonication for 1 h. 0.1610 g Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O dissolved in 20 ml DMF was slowly dropped into the above mixture and then 20 drops of distilled water were added, followed by ultrasonication for 1 h. The mixed solution was aged under ambient temperature for 24 h. The resulting precursor was centrifugated and washed with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 80 \u00b0C in air for 12 h. After calcined at 450 \u00b0C in air for 2 h, the product was cooled to room temperature, and red \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 powders were obtained. 2.3 Sample characterization X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer, with Cu K \u03b1 radiation at 40 kV and 100 mA in a scanning range 3\u201380\u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ). The diffraction peaks of the crystalline phase were compared with those of standard compounds reported in the JCPDS Date File. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with the Al K \u03b1 X-ray source ( hv =1486.6 eV), hybrid (magnetic/electrostatic) optics and a multi-channel plate and delay line detector (DLD). In order to subtract the surface charging effect, the C1s peak was fixed, in agreement with the literature, at a binding energy of 284.6 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Shimadzu SS-550, 15 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Philips FEI Tecnai 20ST, 200 kV) were carried out to observe the morphologies of the sample. Nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. The specific surface area ( S BET ) of the sample was calculated following the multi-point Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) procedure. The pore-size distribution was determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherms using the Barett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) method. 2.4 Fabrication of the gas sensor and measurement of the sensing performance Alumina substrate tube 4 mm long was used for the heater and sensing base. \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow sphere powders were mixed with distilled water, and then were coated onto alumina tube attached with Pt electrodes. The schematic diagram of a typical gas sensor is shown in Scheme 1 . The gas sensing behavior was investigated by using the commercial gas-sensing measurement system of HW-30A. The sensor signal was recorded by a computer at a constant test voltage of 5 V. The operating temperature was controlled by tuning the heating voltage. The sensor response was calculated as the ratio R air / R vap , where R air and R vap are the resistance values of the sample in air and in the presence of acetone vapor, respectively. The response and recovery times were obtained by the time for 90% of full response or 90% of full recovery of the response. 3 Results and discussion A rational mechanism of the formation of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres is described in Scheme 2 . Because as-prepared carbon microspheres had plenty of hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) on the surface, Fe 3+ cations can be absorbed onto the surface of carbon microspheres and bind to the surface hydroxyl groups. Then Fe 3+ further hydrolyzed to form Fe 2 O 3 \u00b7 x H 2 O shell on the surface of the carbon microspheres, the presence of small amount water can promote the hydrolysis reaction, forming a core\u2013shell structure. During calcination the aggregation of Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles resulted in the formation of the pores in shell and the carbon microspheres were removed in the form of carbon dioxide which could escape through the pores [15] . XRD was used to identify the crystal phase of the sample. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared product. It is clear that all the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern can be readily indexed as \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (JCPDS file no. 33\u2013664), and size-broadening of the reflection peaks can be observed. No characteristic reflection peaks from other Fe species can be detected in the sample. The mean crystallite size is 6.7 nm, determined using Scherrer\u2019s equation from (110) diffraction peak of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 . SEM analyses were performed to examine the morphology of the sample. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of as-prepared \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres. As shown, SEM overview observation reveals that as-prepared \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 products consist of spherical microstructures with the diameter of around 200 nm. The outer surfaces of the microspheres are rough, indicating that they are composed of a large number of loosely packed nanoparticles. Close observation reveals that there is partial cave-in on the surface of some microspheres, indicating the hollow core of the sample and thin shell wall. To further investigate the structure of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres, the sample was characterized by HRTEM. Fig. 3 displays the TEM images of the hollow microspheres and the electron diffraction pattern. The strong contrast between the dark edges and pale centers in these images confirms the hollow structure of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 microspheres, with thin shell about 10 nm thick. It can also be clearly observed that the shell is composed of a large number of very small nanoparticles and constitutes a porous framework. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres further reveals that the hollow microspheres are composed of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 polycrystallites. XPS analysis was used to study the surface compositions of the product. As seen in Fig. 4 a, the wide XPS picture of the product shows that no peaks of other elements except C, Fe and O were observed in the picture, indicating that the product consists of Fe and O. The calculated atomic ratio of Fe and O by XPS is approximately 1:4, which is much lower than that (1:1.5) in \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 , suggesting that as-prepared \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres possess the excess oxygen and the enhanced oxygen adsorption capability. Fig. 4 b shows the high-resolution XPS of Fe 2 p . The binding energies of Fe 2 p 3/2 and Fe 2 p 1/2 are centered at 710.6 and 724.4 eV, respectively, with an energy separation between the spin\u2013orbit doublet of 14 eV, indicating the existence of the oxidation state of Fe 3+ [16] . As shown in Fig. 4 c, the O 1 s spectrum is broad, complex and exhibits four peaks. There exists two types of crystal lattice oxygen species on the sample, and the binding energies are 528.1 and 530.0 eV, respectively. Peak at 530.0 eV is in good agreement with crystal lattice oxygen in \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 bonded to Fe 3+ [17] . The origin of peak at 528.1 eV is obscure. It is suggested that the peak at 528.1 eV may root in the crystal lattice oxygen bonded to both Fe 3+ and H + (Fe\u2013O\u2013H). The different in electronegative between Fe 3+ and H + influences their bonding state with O 2\u2212 , which results in the shift in O 1 s energy level and the decrease in binding energies. As can be seen, there also exists two types of chemisorbed oxygen species. The binding energies are around 531.9 and 533.4 eV, respectively. It is well known that position of the signal of O 1 s of the adsorbed oxygen relies on the charge state of adsorbed oxygen [18] . Peak at 531.9 eV is attributed to adsorbed O \u2212 species on the surface of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres, and peak at 533.4 eV is attributed to chemisorbed O 2 \u2212 species on the surface. The surface area and porosity of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres were investigated by means of Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis and nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms. Because the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres are composed of a large number of nanoparticles, a high surface area can be expected, which is proven by BET analysis. The BET specific surface area is 111.6 m 2 /g. Fig. 5 a and b shows the N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres. A distinct hysteresis loop can be observed between adsorption and desorption branch, indicating porous structure of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres. The plot of the pore size distribution reveals that the porous hollow microspheres with a size distribution of 1\u201320 nm and centered at 2.5 nm. The \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres have an average pore diameter of 6.5 nm. Acetone gas sensing measurements were carried out at different operating temperatures and different acetone vapor concentrations in air. To determine the optimal operating temperature to detect acetone vapor, the sensor working temperature was varied from 50 to 450 \u00b0C. As seen in Figs. 6 and 7 , the operating temperature has a great influence on the acetone vapor response and on the dynamic behavior of the response. Fig. 6 reports the response of the sensor to 100 ppm acetone vapor as a function of operating temperature. The sensor response is observed to be poor when the operating temperature is below 200 \u00b0C, while the sensor response is very good when the operating temperature is above 250 \u00b0C, and the response reaches a maximum value at the operating temperature of 350 \u00b0C. However, the sensor response is observed to degrade when the operating temperature is higher than 400 \u00b0C. As mentioned earlier, the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres are porous and possess a large amount of chemisorbed oxygen species ( O 2 \u2212 and O \u2212 ) on the surface. The large specific surface and the increasing effective adsorption sites on the surface result in the improved sensing property. When the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres are exposed to the reducing gas like acetone vapor, the acetone vapor reacts with the chemisorbed oxygen species, which induces that the electrons are released back to the conduction band, accompanied with a decrease in resistance [19] . It is well known that the change in resistance of semiconducting oxide gas sensors is primarily caused by adsorption and desorption of gas molecules on the surface of the sensor [20] . Therefore, it is suggested that the sensing behavior of the sensor not only relies on the interaction of acetone vapor molecules with chemisorbed oxygen species, but rather on the adsorption of the acetone vapor molecules on the surface and the desorption of the products. At lower temperature, the reaction products do not get readily desorbed from the sensor surface. The species cover the sensing sites on the sensor surface, which prevents the further reaction between acetone vapor and chemisorbed oxygen. Subsequently, no appreciable change in the resistance of the sensor is observed, so the resistance of the sensor decreases little, resulting in the lower response. As increase in the operating temperature the reaction products are readily desorbed, giving sensing sites on the sensor to react with new gas species, resulting in the higher response. However, when the operating temperature is higher than the optimal temperature, the acetone is difficult to be adsorbed, resulting in less acetone vapor reacting with chemisorbed oxygen. Therefore, the response decreases. Fig. 7 depicts the response and recovery characteristics curves versus operating temperature to 100 ppm acetone vapor. The response and recovery times are found to be dependent upon the operating temperature. The response times are very fast, lower than 5 s, at all operating temperature except 250 \u00b0C (17 s). In contrast, the recovery times are relatively long and become longer with increasing the operating temperature, however, the values of recovery times lie within 30 s. Fig. 8 shows the response of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres based sensor as a function of the acetone vapor concentration at the optimal working temperature of 350 \u00b0C. As can be observed, the response increases significantly with increasing the acetone vapor concentration from 10 to 1000 ppm. The increase in the gas concentration implies a large surface coverage, resulting in an increase in the surface reaction between the surface adsorbed oxygen species and the vapor molecules. The chemisorbed negative oxygen ions on the sensor surface can react with acetone to release electrons, and with the increase in vapor concentrations more electrons may be released to the surface of sensor, resulting in an increase in response. However, the response slowly increases with increase in the acetone vapor concentrations above 1000 ppm, which indicates that the sensor response exhibits more or less saturation of the surface coverage of vapor molecules. The similar behavior has been observed by other groups [19,21] . Fig. 9 shows the response and recovery characteristic curves for different concentrations of acetone vapor at the operating temperature of 350 \u00b0C. As seen from Fig. 9 , the response is very fast and the response times are within 5 s after exposed to different concentrations of acetone vapor. However, the recovery is not as quick as the response, and the recovery time increases with increasing acetone vapor concentrations. Fortunately, the recovery time does not exceed 30 s even the vapor concentrations up to 4000 ppm. 4 Conclusions In summary, porous \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres were synthesized through a simple and efficient carbon microsphere template method. The samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption. Structural characterization indicates that as-prepared \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres have porous structure with around 200 nm in diameter and about 10 nm in shell thick. The average pore size and BET surface area of hollow microspheres are 6.5 nm and 111.6 m 2 /g, respectively. The acetone gas sensing behavior investigation shows that as-synthesized \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 hollow microspheres exhibit very good response to acetone vapor.

The results indicated La/TiO2 NTs calcined at 300\u00b0C consisted of anatase as the unique phase. The absorption spectra of the La/TiO2 NTs showed a stronger absorption in the UV range and a slight red shift in the band gap transition than that of pure TiO2 nanotubes. The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 NTs could be improved by the doping of lanthanum ions, which is ascribed to several beneficial effects the formation of Ti-OLa bond and charge imbalance, existing of oxygen defects and Ti3+ species, stronger absorption in the UV range and a slight red shift in the band gap transition, as well as higher equilibrium dark adsorption of methyl orange. 0.75 wt% La/TiO2 NTs had the best catalytic activity. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "\u03b3-Fe_2O_3 nanopowders were synthesized from the two microemulsion solutions,such as NaOH/ DBS/C_6H_5CH_3/H_2O and NaOH/CTAB/CHCl_3/CH_3CH_2CH_2OH/H_2O,and their gas sensing properties were studied.The products were characterized by means of FT-IR,XRD and TEM.The results indicate that spheri- cal\u03b3-Fe_2O_3 nanoparticles with a particle size of about 4\uff5e5 nm can be obtained from the two microemulsion solutions,when DBS and CTAB were used as surfactant and the ratios of W/O were 10.77 and 10.56, respectively.The small particle size can be attributed to the remanant surfactants adsorbed on\u03b3-Fe_2O_3 nano- particles which prevent the aggregation of\u03b3-Fe_2O_3 nanoparticles.The sensors,made from\u03b3-Fe_2O_3 nanopow- ders obtained from the two microemulsion solutions,have high sensitivities of 12.5 for DBS and 23.8 for CTAB to 0.1% ethanol,as well as show short response-recovery time to 0.1% ethanol,that is,20 and 30 s for DBS and 15 and 47 s for CTAB,respectively.Both of them can meet the requirements of practical applications and are promising ethanol sensors due to their sensitivities and good linear relations to the concentration.",

        "abstract": "Two kinds of various morphological \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified by anionic surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfonate, SDS) and cationic surfactant (hexadecyipyridinium chloride, HPC), respectively, have been synthesized via hydrothermal method, using simple inorganic salt (NH 4 ) 3 Fe(C 2 O 4 ) 3 and alkali NaOH as starting precursors. Meanwhile, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant are also fabricated under the same conditions for comparison. The resultant products were characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron micrograph (TEM) combined with electron diffraction (ED) and magnetization measurements. It is interesting that the obtained \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant are polyhedral with average particle size of 90 \u00b1 35 nm; while the obtained \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified by SDS are ellipsoidal with mean particle size of major axis: ca. 420 nm; minor axis: ca. 205 nm and those modified by HPC are spherical with mean particle size of ca. 185 nm observed from TEM. In addition, magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal that the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified by two surfactants show enhancement in coercivity ( H c ) and the remanent magnetization ( M r ) compared with those of the obtained \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant at room temperature. The experimental results suggest that the surfactants not only significantly influence the size and shape of the particles, but also their magnetic properties. Keywords A. Nanostructures B. Chemical synthesis C. X-ray diffraction D. Magnetic properties 1 Introduction The motivation for the fabrication of various morphology and size of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles was driven by the strong interest in their novel properties and potential applications in red pigments, catalysts, ceramic, anticorrosive agents and gas sensors [1\u20138] . Till now, several synthetic methods have been developed for preparation of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles including sol\u2013gel, hydrolysis of iron salt and hydrothermal synthesis [7,9,10] . Hydrothermal synthesis has shown to be advantageous over other methods in homogeneous nucleation and grain growth of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. In particular, Sorescu et al. [11] have synthesized hematite particles of four different morphologies by the hydrothermal method and have reported for the first time that the particle morphology plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of hematite. In addition, surfactants have been widely employed to synthesize metal oxide nanoparticles in previous literatures [12\u201314] . For instance, Wang et al. [12] have successfully prepared ZnO, NiO and SnO 2 nanoparticles with cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, CTAB) to be good candidates for obtaining well-dispersed and spherical particles. Chen et al. [13] have prepared different morphological \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles from Fe(OH) 3 gel deposited by anionic surfactant (sodium dodecylebenzene sulphonate, DBS) solution via the solvothermal process in the presence of n -butylalcohol or dimethylbenzene as medium. Liu et al. [14] have fabricated \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles coated with DBS or CTAB by the microemulsion method. With regard to the above factors, in this paper, we select two different surfactants to modify the reaction conditions for fabrication of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles by hydrothermal approach, the main aim is to investigate how different surfactants change the shape and size of the final products and then influence their magnetic properties. The resultant products were characterized by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron micrograph (TEM) combined with electron diffraction (ED) and magnetization measurements. 2 Experimental All chemicals used in our experiments are analytical reagents and used as received. Forty millilitres of 0.6 M NaOH aqueous solution was slowly added to the same volume of 0.1 M (NH 4 ) 3 Fe(C 2 O 4 ) 3 aqueous solution under vigorous stirring until a slurry suspension formed. 0.52 g SDS was then added into the above suspension, followed by additional agitation for 7 h. Subsequently, the mixed system was poured into a Teflon-lined autoclave of 100 ml capacity, sealed into stainless steel tanks and heated at 180 \u00b0C for 2 h. After the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature, precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled water and absolute ethanol to remove residual ions and excessive surfactant. Finally, the precipitates were dried at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h; a reddish-brown powder was obtained, named as \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS. Similar procedure was performed to synthesize \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC, only 3.6 g HPC instead of 0.52 g SDS was added in the reaction process. Product \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant was also prepared under the same conditions for comparison. IR spectra in KBr pellets were recorded in the range 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 on an American Nicolet AVATAR 380 FT-IR spectrometer. XRD spectra were performed on a Japan Rigaku D/max 2500 XRD with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The particle morphology and size of the samples were determined on a Holland Phillips EM400ST transmission electron microscopy combined with ED. Magnetic measurements were carried out on an American LDJ 9600 vibrating sample magnetometer with a maximum field of 7.0 kOe at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion The X-ray patterns of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS and \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC are shown in Fig. 1 a\u2013c , respectively. As expected, the hematite diffraction peaks of them are identical, which are in agreement with the reported values (JCPDS No. 33-663), suggesting that there are no other compounds in presence of the final \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 products. The mean crystallite diameter, calculated by Scherrer\u2019s equation, is found to be 55, 76 and 95 nm for the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS and \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC, respectively. TEM images of the three products are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be found that the TEM pattern of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant (see Fig. 2 a) shows monodispersed polyhedral shape with particle size of around 90 \u00b1 35 nm, while the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS (see Fig. 2 b) shows monodispersed ellipsoidal shape with mean particle size of major axis: ca. 420 nm; minor axis: ca. 205 nm; and the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC (see Fig. 2 c) shows monodispersed spherical shape with mean particle size of ca. 185 nm. It is evident that the morphologies transform from irregular to regular, and the particle size of each product is clearly larger than that of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant, indicating that the surfactants can effectively adjust the shape and size of the particles, and the products modified by the surfactants possess higher crystallinity. However, the particle size of all samples observed from TEM is larger than that calculated by XRD, revealing that the monodispersed particles are polycrystalline in nature, consisting of large numbers of smaller subparticles of tens of nanometers. Similar polycrystalline behavior has also been reported by other authors [15\u201319] . In addition, the corresponding ED patterns of the three samples (inserted in Fig. 2 a\u2013c) show several diffused rings, respectively, indicative of a fine crystallite size character. This is in accordance with our result. IR spectra of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC, \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS and \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant are shown in Fig. 3 a\u2013c , respectively. It can be seen that the IR spectra of them present similar trends. The dominant bands of the three products (at about 472 and 570 cm \u22121 ) are characteristic of crystalline \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 [20] . The bands around 3430 and 1636 cm \u22121 in all samples are assigned to the stretching vibration of OH groups and bending vibration of water molecules, respectively [21] . Interestingly, the absorption peak at 475 cm \u22121 hardly changes from Fig. 3 a\u2013c, suggesting that this peak has not been affected in our experimental conditions. But the dominant absorption peak at 570 cm \u22121 shifts to somewhat lower frequencies and becomes broader from Fig. 3 a\u2013c when the mean crystallite diameter decreases. It is probably due to the changes of the morphology and the internal structure of the particles [22] , since the obtained particles consist of large numbers of smaller subparticles. Hence, when the mean crystallite diameter decreases, the absorption peak become broader, which can be explained by the facts that the subparticles closely attached in a particle are subjected to some dipole\u2013dipole interactions. Consequently, phonons cannot be confined within each subparticle unit, but can pass across the subparticle boundaries to be delocalized in a whole particle. As a result, the collective infrared properties of the subparticles are basically similar to a single-crystalline particle. However, there must be anharmonic potentials around the subparticle boundaries, created mainly by the dipolar even high multipolar interactions between subparticles, which may accelerate the decay of the phonons, resulting in the substantial peak broadening. This effect is pronounced with the decreasing mean crystallite diameter due to the higher density of the subparticle boundaries. Magnetic hysteresis measurements for the three products were carried out in applied magnetic field at room temperature and the related magnetic parameters are listed in Table 1 . The hysteresis loops of all products (see Fig. 4 ) do not reach saturation up to the maximum applied magnetic field. It can be also seen from Fig. 4 a that the data show no hysteresis (immeasurable remanent magnetization and very lower coercivity), indicating that the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant are superparamagnetic. However, the magnetization measurements of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC and \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS (see Fig. 4 b\u2013c) exhibit hysteretic feature with the remanent magnetization and coercivity being determined to be 0.08445 emu/g and 300.2 Oe, 0.06154 emu/g and 442.6 Oe, respectively, suggesting that the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC and \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS are weak ferromagnetic at room temperature. It is found that the remanent magnetization and coercivity increase after the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified by two surfactants, indicating the surfactants can affect the products\u2019 magnetic characteristics in our experimental conditions. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: (1) Since the obtained particles are polycrystalline which consist of large numbers of smaller subparticles inside them. After the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified by the surfactants, the particle size increases compared with that of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant; so, the number of the subparticles increases, which can result in the enhancement in coercivity. Our opinion is basically coincident with the earlier reports [15,16] . (2) There is a possibility that after the products modified by surfactants, the increase in coercivity may be associated with a corresponding change from the multidomain to single domain. (3) Surfactants mainly affect the particle surface, thus, the change of the particle surface can result in the spin pinning owing to the increase of the magnetic surface anisotropy, and then influence the magnetic nature. Of course, our view should be further confirmed by more experimental evidences. 4 Conclusion Monodispersed ellipsoidal and spherical shape \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles modified by SDS and HPC, respectively, have been synthesized via hydrothermal method, using (NH 4 ) 3 Fe(C 2 O 4 ) 3 and NaOH as starting materials. It can be seen from TEM that the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant show monodispersed polyhedral shape with particle size of around 90 \u00b1 35 nm, while the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /SDS nanoparticles show monodispersed ellipsoidal shape with mean particle size of major axis: ca. 420 nm; minor axis: ca. 205 nm; and the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /HPC nanoparticles show monodispersed spherical shape with mean particle size of ca. 185 nm. It is evident that the morphologies transform from irregular to regular, and the particle size of each product is clearly larger than that of the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 without surfactant, indicating that the surfactants can effectively adjust the shape, and size of the particles and the products modified by the surfactants possess higher crystallinity. At the same time, after the products modified by the surfactants, the increase in coercivity may be associated with a corresponding change from the multidomain to single domain, the increase of the number of the subparticles and the increase of the magnetic surface anisotropy. Magnetization measurements reveal that the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without surfactant exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, however, the other two products modified by SDS and HPC all show weak ferromagnetic properties. Thus, it can be concluded that the surfactants not only significantly influence the size and shape of the particles, but also their magnetic properties. Hence, this paper presents a new synthetic strategy to obtain various size, shape and magnetic nanoparticles via hydrothermal route for specific industrial applications. References [1] R.H.

The samples were characterized by HRTEM, XRD, H 2 -TPR, and XPS. The catalytic properties of the prepared catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation were studied by using a microreactor\u2013GC system. The results showed that the thermal decomposition temperature affected the physical properties of the prepared CeO 2 particles, such as particle size and morphology. The loading of CuO in non-crystalline forms on CeO 2 supports was different in the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. The loading of non-crystalline CuO was higher on the CeO 2 prepared via thermal decomposition at 500 \u00b0C than those on the CeO 2 prepared via thermal decomposition at 400, 600 and 700 \u00b0C. One part of the non-crystalline CuO in CuO/CeO 2 catalysts entered the CeO 2 lattice and the other part dispersed over the CeO 2 surface. Calcination temperature had little effect on the catalytic activity when it was lower than 600 \u00b0C. However, heating the catalysts to higher temperatures (i.e. 800 \u00b0C) had a significant impact on the catalytic activity because the crystallite size rapidly grows and more CuO and CeO 2 phase-separation occurs. Keywords Thermal decomposition Ceria CuO/CeO 2 catalysts Low-temperature CO oxidation 1 Introduction Catalysts based on ceria present a wide range of applications, such as three-way catalysts for automobile exhaust gas emission control, removal of SO x \u2013NO x from fluid catalytic cracking flue gases, electrocatalysts over fuel cell electrodes, and catalysts for various oxidation and hydrogenation reactions [1] . For such applications, especially for automobile exhaust gas emission control, CeO 2 performs the following functions: (1) it stabilizes the catalyst against metal dispersion; (2) it stores and releases oxygen; and (3) it improves CO oxidation and NO x reduction [2] . On the other hand, copper-based catalysts have recently attracted much attention in heterogeneous catalysis because of their high catalytic activities toward NO and CO and hydrocarbon oxidation [3] . In recent years, the Cu\u2013Ce\u2013O system has been found to be effective catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation and was widely studied with the hope that it could be used as a replacement for expensive precious metal catalysts [1,2,4\u201316] . In our early work [4\u201310] , we prepared Cu\u2013Ce\u2013O catalysts via solvated metal atom impregnation, sol\u2013gel, alcohothermal synthesis combined with impregnation method. We investigated the structures of CeO 2 and Cu\u2013Ce\u2013O catalysts by UV\u2013vis, FT-Raman, XRD, SEM, HRTEM, BET, TPR and XPS, and we studied their catalytic activity in low-temperature CO oxidation. In this paper, we report the low-temperature CO oxidation properties of CuO/CeO 2 composite catalysts prepared via thermal decomposition combined with impregnation. The prepared CeO 2 nanoparticles and CuO/CeO 2 composite catalysts were characterized by means of various technologies and the catalytic activity was studied by using a microreactor\u2013GC system. The effect of thermal decomposition temperature on the CeO 2 physical properties and the corresponding CuO/CeO 2 catalyst activity valves in CO oxidation were studied in detail. Furthermore, the CuO/CeO 2 catalyst pretreatment effects on the catalytic activity were also studied. The information gained may aid the development of Cu\u2013Ce\u2013O catalysts, which may replace precious metal catalysts for the low-temperature CO oxidation. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation CeO 2 was prepared by thermal decomposition of cerous nitrate, Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O, for 4 h at 400, 500, 600, or 700 \u00b0C in air, respectively. The prepared buff particles are denoted as CeO 2 -A, CeO 2 -B, CeO 2 -C and CeO 2 -D, in turn. The supported CuO/CeO 2 composite catalysts were prepared by the conventional wet impregnation method. The prepared CeO 2 supports were impregnated with an aqueous solution of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b73H 2 O for 5 h and excess water was then vaporized at 60 \u00b0C by heating. The obtained materials were dried overnight in an oven at 80 \u00b0C and calcined in air for 3.5 h at 300, 400, 500, 600, or 800 \u00b0C, respectively. The prepared catalysts are denoted as CuO/CeO 2 -A, CuO/CeO 2 -B, CuO/CeO 2 -C and CuO/CeO 2 -D. The final loading of CuO for all the samples was 6.3 wt.%. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The morphology and crystal analysis of the prepared CeO 2 particles were studied by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) linked with a Philips T20ST transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The crystalline structures of the prepared CeO 2 and CuO/CeO 2 catalysts were analyzed by using a DMAX-2500 diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The working voltage and current of the X-ray tube were 40 kV and 100 mA. The average crystalline size was calculated from the X-ray line broadening, according to Scherrer's equation [17] . Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed with H 2 as reductant using Autochem 2910 Micromeritics (USA) instrument. The reduction gas was a mixture of 5% H 2 in N 2 flowing at 30 mL min \u22121 . The heating rate was 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The H 2 uptake amount during the reduction was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a PHI-1600 spectrometer (USA) equipped with a Mg K\u03b1 radiation source for exciting photoelectrons. The X-ray source was operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and 250 W. The pressure in the ion-pumped analysis chamber was maintained at 8 \u00d7 10 \u221210 Torr (1 Torr = 133.33 Pa) during data acquisition. All binding energies (BE) were referenced to the adventitious C 1s line at 284.6 eV (1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10 \u221219 J). 2.3 Catalytic studies The activity of the catalyst samples was tested using a fixed bed flow microreactor under atmospheric pressure. Fifty milligrams of catalyst powder was diluted with 2 g of fine quartz sand. The gases contained 1.0% CO balanced with air and the total gas flow rate were 33.6 mL min \u22121 . The reactant and product composition were analyzed on-line with a GC-508A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of catalysts Fig. 1 illustrates the HRTEM images of the prepared CeO 2 particles. One can see from Fig. 1 , the HRTEM patterns of the CeO 2 -A and CeO 2 -B showed mostly regular spherical shapes. Furthermore, the ratio of spherical particles decreased with the increasing of thermal decomposition temperature. The morphology of CeO 2 -C became obviously irregular and CeO 2 -D showed various shapes, such as spherical, claviform, subuliform and rhombohedral. In addition, the HRTEM picture of CeO 2 -D shows obviously larger particle sizes than were present in the pictures of CeO 2 -A, CeO 2 -B and CeO 2 -C. The results indicated that the thermal decomposition temperature affected the physical properties of the prepared CeO 2 particles such as particle size and morphology, which are of critical importance for its applications in catalysis [18] . On the other hand, the SAED patterns in Fig. 1 indicate that the prepared CeO 2 was crystalline in local area while the different grain boundaries indicated that the material was polycrystalline overall. The XRD patterns of the prepared CeO 2 -A, CeO 2 -B, CeO 2 -C and CeO 2 -D particles are presented in Fig. 2 a\u2013d, respectively. All the peaks could be indexed to the cubic phase of ceria with fluorite structure (JCPDS Data File # 43-1002). Furthermore, when the heating temperature was between 300 and 600 \u00b0C, it had no obvious effect on the broadenings and relative peak intensity of CeO 2 phase. When the heating temperature rose to 700 \u00b0C, however, the temperature effect became obvious, indicating that the crystallites were much larger. The average crystallite size of CeO 2 was 17.5, 18.2, 19.1 and 39.6 nm for CeO 2 -A, CeO 2 -B, CeO 2 -C and CeO 2 -D, respectively. The results agreed with the above results of HRTEM analyses. The X-ray patterns of CuO/CeO 2 -A, CuO/CeO 2 -B, CuO/CeO 2 -C and CuO/CeO 2 -D catalysts calcined in air for 3.5 h at elevated temperatures are shown in Figs. 3\u20136 , respectively. The distinct CeO 2 fluorite-type oxide structure was presented in all samples. Furthermore, when the calcination temperature was lower than 600 \u00b0C, it had no obvious effect on the broadenings and relative peak intensity of CeO 2 phase; the average sizes of CeO 2 particles listed in Table 1 were thus close to each other. When the calcination temperature rose to 800 \u00b0C, the temperature effect became obvious and the CeO 2 particle size was much larger than before. This indicates that only high temperature treatment affects the degree of crystallinity and the particle size of CeO 2 phase obviously. On the other hand, no obvious diffraction lines due to CuO were detected even when the 2 \u03b8 (30\u201350\u00b0) was expanded where CuO peaks are expected for CuO/CeO 2 -A and CuO/CeO 2 -B catalysts calcined at 300\u2013600 \u00b0C. Only weak peaks attributed to CuO crystal phase appeared until the calcination temperature rose to 800 \u00b0C for CuO/CeO 2 -A and CuO/CeO 2 -B catalysts and for all the CuO/CeO 2 -C and CuO/CeO 2 -D catalysts, indicating that most of CuO was non-crystalline. This result was due to the fine dispersion of CuO on the CeO 2 surface, to Cu\u2013Ce\u2013O solid solution formation or to a combination of the above two phenomena [14] . The XRD analyses indicate that both the physical properties of CeO 2 supports and the calcination temperatures affected the ratio of CuO in non-crystalline forms. In order to verify the state of non-crystalline CuO, we did XRD analyses that emphasized the microstructure of pure CeO 2 -B and CuO/CeO 2 -B catalyst. The two samples were pretreated in air at 500 \u00b0C for 3.5 h. The results showed that the cell parameter and cell volume value of pure CeO 2 -B was 0.5409 nm and 0.1582 nm 3 , respectively. After CuO and CeO 2 -B formed CuO/CeO 2 -B catalyst, the cell parameter and cell volume value of CeO 2 -B was 0.5402 nm and 0.1576 nm 3 , respectively (i.e. smaller than the values of pure CeO 2 -B), indicating that some non-crystalline CuO had entered the CeO 2 -B lattice, as the Cu 2+ ion radius (0.076 nm) is smaller than that of Ce 4+ (0.101 nm). Therefore, the CeO 2 particles in CuO/CeO 2 catalysts calcined at low temperatures (\u2264500 \u00b0C) are smaller than the particles of pure CeO 2 supports. The typical TPR profiles of CuO/CeO 2 -A, CuO/CeO 2 -B, CuO/CeO 2 -C, and CuO/CeO 2 -D catalysts calcined at 500 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 7 a\u2013d. The TPR profile of CuO/CeO 2 -A showed mainly one reduction peak at about 183 \u00b0C. In addition, there were two shoulder peaks at about 137 and 215 \u00b0C ( Fig. 7 a). The reduction features of the CuO/CeO 2 -B catalyst, shown in Fig. 7 b, were different from those of the CuO/CeO 2 -A catalyst. Two overlapping reduction peaks with higher intensity at about 134 and 204 \u00b0C were present. The reduction profile of CuO/CeO 2 -C catalyst were characterized by a weak peak and a strong peak at 140 and 199 \u00b0C, respectively. In addition, there was a shoulder peak at about 218 \u00b0C. The reduction profile of CuO/CeO 2 -D catalyst was characterized by a weak peak and a strong peak at 138 and 219 \u00b0C, respectively. In addition, there was a very weak shoulder peak at about 160 \u00b0C. The TPR profiles of CuO/CeO 2 -C catalysts calcined at 300 or 800 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 8 . The reduction profiles of CuO/CeO 2 -C catalysts calcined at 300 \u00b0C was characterized by a reduction peak (\u03b1 peak) and a stronger peak (\u03b2 peak) at about 140 and about 199 \u00b0C, respectively. In addition, there was a shoulder peak at about 218 \u00b0C (\u03b3 peak). However, The TPR profile of CuO/CeO 2 -C calcined at 800 \u00b0C showed mainly one reduction peak (\u03b4 peak) at about 248 \u00b0C. The presence of more than one reduction peak in all the present samples is an indication of the existence of more than one copper oxide species in the prepared CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. A great amount of literature data is available for TPR studies of Cu-based catalysts. The synergistic interaction between the CuO and CeO 2 support is more evident from the decrease in the reduction temperatures of both CuO moieties and CeO 2 support. The TPR peak shape and position highly depend on the experimental conditions and the catalyst system. Liu and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos [19] reported two reduction peaks, where reduction of copper oxide clusters strongly interacting with ceria, was observed in the range of 125\u2013175 \u00b0C, while larger CuO particles, non-associated with CeO 2 , were reduced at \u223c200 \u00b0C. Ranga et al. [20] attributed the TPR peaks at 145 and 170 \u00b0C of CuO/CeO 2 samples to highly dispersed CuO and to fairly large clusters of CuO on CeO 2 surface, respectively. Jiang et al. [2] also observed two reduction peaks for CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. The peak at lower temperature represented small CuO particles interacted with CeO 2 which were highly dispersed. Another one at higher temperature represented larger bulk CuO particles interacted with CeO 2 . Wrobel et al. [21] reported copper reduction in the range of 120\u2013150 \u00b0C for CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. Similar results were also reported by Ratnasamy et al. [22] , where two overlapping reductions were attributed to dispersed copper oxide clusters, strongly interacting with CeO 2 and CuO particles. In addition, George and Theophilos [23] observed there were three overlapping reduction peaks: a low-intensity, low-temperature peak at 168 \u00b0C attributed to reduction of copper ions strongly interacting with CeO 2 and two peaks of higher intensity at 210 and 255 \u00b0C that represented the reduction of larger CuO particles less associated with ceria. Even so, these CuO particles had to be of smaller size compared to those of pure CuO, as they also reduced at lower temperatures. Tang et al. [24] also observed three reduction peaks: The first peak was ascribed to the reduction of CuO on the ceria surface; the second one was ascribed to the reduction of larger CuO species on the surface; and the third peak was ascribed to the reduction of bulk CuO and surface CeO 2 . Similar results were also reported by Dong et al. [25] . Based on the above, the TPR peaks at the range of 134\u2013140 \u00b0C (or \u03b1) and 183\u2013204 \u00b0C (or \u03b2) of CuO/CeO 2 -A,CuO/CeO 2 -B and CuO/CeO 2 -C samples may be attributed to reduction of non-crystalline CuO strongly interacting with CeO 2 and the reduction of larger CuO particles weakly associated with CeO 2 , respectively. The peak at 215 \u00b0C of the CuO/CeO 2 -A sample, the \u03b3 peak of the CuO/CeO 2 -C sample and the peak at 219 \u00b0C of the CuO/CeO 2 -D sample probably represented the reduction of bulk copper oxide (crystalline forms) which associated with CeO 2 to some extent. The \u03b4 peak of the CuO/CeO 2 -C sample represented the reduction of pure bulk copper oxide. The difference between the two kinds of bulk CuO phases needs further study. The typical spectra of Ce 3d and Cu 2p binding energies of the CuO/CeO 2 -C catalyst calcined in air at 500 \u00b0C for 3.5 h are shown in Fig. 9 . In Fig. 9 a, Ce 3d shows mainly five peaks at about 881.9, 888.4, 897.7, 900.2, and 906.9 eV, which was similar to the reported peaks of Ce 4+ [26] , indicating the main valence of CeO 2 in the prepared CuO/CeO 2 catalysts was 4+. The peaks of Cu 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 1/2 were centered at 932.1 and 952.1 eV, respectively. The Cu 2p 3/2 value of the samples was lower than that of CuO, i.e. 933.6 eV [23] . This may suggest the presence of reduced copper species in the prepared CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. The Cu 2p 3/2 value cannot, however, be used to distinguish between Cu 2 O and Cu 0 because they are essentially identical. 3.2 Catalytic activity for CO oxidation The light-off curves over the prepared CuO/CeO 2 -A, CuO/CeO 2 -B, CuO/CeO 2 -C and CuO/CeO 2 -D catalysts are presented in Figs. 10\u201313 , respectively. The catalytic activity valves of pure CeO 2 -A, CeO 2 -B, CeO 2 -C and CeO 2 -D are also included in the corresponding figure for comparison purposes. One should note that the CO conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature for all the present catalysts. The activity of pure CeO 2 was quite low, and the activity of the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts, except for those calcined at 800 \u00b0C, was much higher than that of pure CeO 2 . The pure CuO (thermal decomposition of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 at 500 \u00b0C for 3.5 h) had no catalytic activity under the present condition. This indicated that there is a synergistic effect between the CuO and CeO 2 support that is responsible for the high activity of CO oxidation. It is clear from Figs. 10\u201313 that the light-off temperatures of CuO/CeO 2 -A, CuO/CeO 2 -B and CuO/CeO 2 -C catalysts are lower than that of CuO/CeO 2 -D catalysts under the reaction conditions. When the catalysts were calcined at 300\u2013600 \u00b0C, the reaction temperature ranges for CO full conversion of CuO/CeO 2 -A, CuO/CeO 2 -B and CuO/CeO 2 -C catalysts was 140\u2013160, 140\u2013160 and 140\u2013170 \u00b0C, respectively. However, the reaction temperature for CO full conversion of CuO/CeO 2 -D catalysts was 200\u2013210 \u00b0C. The combined results of the HRTEM, XRD and TPR analyses show that the various CeO 2 supports had different surface defects that led to the loading differences of non-crystalline CuO which entered into the ceria lattice or dispersed on the ceria surface. Liu and Flytzani-Stephanopoulos [16] suggested that the activity of Cu\u2013Ce\u2013O catalyst derived primarily from the combination of finely dispersed copper\u2013cerium oxide systems, and bulk copper oxides gave negligible contributions. Luo et al. [27] also suggested that the dispersed CuO was responsible for the low-temperature CO oxidation in CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. The results indicated that CeO 2 supports affect the synergistic effect, subsequently affect the catalytic activity of the corresponding CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. From Fig. 10 , one can see that the catalytic activity valves of CuO/CeO 2 -A catalysts calcined at 300\u2013600 \u00b0C were very close to each other when the reaction temperature was in the 80\u2013100 \u00b0C region. When the reaction temperature increased further, the catalysts calcined at 400\u2013600 \u00b0C exhibited higher catalytic activity than that calcined at 300 \u00b0C. The reaction temperature for full CO conversion over the former catalysts decreased by 20 \u00b0C compared with that over the latter one. However, the CuO/CeO 2 -A catalysts calcined at 300\u2013600 \u00b0C exhibited much higher catalytic activity than that calcined at 800 \u00b0C. Similar results were also observed in Fig. 11 . The catalytic activity of CuO/CeO 2 -B catalysts calcined at 500 and 600 \u00b0C was higher than that of CuO/CeO 2 -B catalysts calcined at 300 and 400 \u00b0C. But the activity difference was not so obvious and the former catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity than that calcined at 800 \u00b0C. Fig. 12 shows the activity sequence of the present CuO/CeO 2 -C catalysts: sample calcined at 600 \u00b0C \u2265 sample calcined at 500 \u00b0C > sample calcined at 400 \u00b0C > sample calcined at 300 \u00b0C \u2265 sample calcined at 800 \u00b0C. Fig. 13 presents an activity sequence similar to that in Fig. 12 . The CuO/CeO 2 -D catalyst calcined at 800 \u00b0C exhibited the lowest catalytic activity. On the other hand, when the reaction temperature is in the 90\u2013130 \u00b0C regions, the CuO/CeO 2 -D catalyst calcined at 600 \u00b0C exhibited the highest activity. When the temperature increased further, it still remained the highest activity but the catalysts calcined at 300\u2013500 \u00b0C exhibited closer activity values. In summary, the prepared CuO/CeO 2 activity increased with the increasing of the calcination temperature and reached a maximum where the calcination temperature was at about 600 \u00b0C; then the activity decreased with the increasing of calcination temperature. The results indicate that calcination temperature is an important factor for the activity of the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. As mentioned above, the finely dispersed CuO on CeO 2 , i.e. the non-crystal form CuO, is responsible for the low-temperature CO oxidation, and the bulk CuO contributes little to, even deteriorates, the activity. From XRD, TPR and catalytic activity results, heating the catalyst to temperature over 800 \u00b0C has a significant impact on the catalytic activity because of the rapid growth of crystallite size and more CuO and CeO 2 phase-separation. Compared to CuO/CeO 2 catalysts prepared via other techniques that we have reported [4,6\u201310] , the catalysts prepared via thermal decomposition combined with impregnation method exhibited similar or even better catalytic performances under the same reaction conditions. 4 Conclusions In this paper, CeO 2 nanoparticles with different physical properties were prepared via a thermal decomposition method. Four series of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts were prepared by a impregnation technique and tested for low-temperature carbon monoxide oxidation. H 2 -TPR indicated the existence of more than one copper oxide species in the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts and the loading of non-crystalline CuO varied with different physical properties of CeO 2 -supported CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. XPS analysis indicated that the main valence state of cerium was 4+ and that the reduced copper species were present in the prepared CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. The physical properties of CeO 2 supports affect the catalytic activity of the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. High temperature (i.e. 600 \u00b0C) calcination made CuO disperse on CeO 2 better and helped to increase catalytic activity of the CuO/CeO 2 catalysts. But the higher temperatures (i.e. 800 \u00b0C) had a significant impact on the catalytic activity because of the rapid growth of crystallite size and more CuO and CeO 2 phase-separation. The thermal decomposition combined with the impregnation method appears to be a simple and effective method for the preparation of CuO/CeO 2 catalysts.

        "abstract": "A novel sensing material of Ni-doped SnO 2 hollow spheres was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Gas sensing properties of the sensor fabricated from the as-prepared Ni-doped SnO 2 hollow spheres were systematically investigated and compared with those of pristine SnO 2 hollow spheres. Results showed that the Ni-doped sensor had a good selectivity to higher alcohols such as n-butanol with much higher response, while the undoped sensor exhibited poor response to all the tested gases with poor selectivity. The enhanced sensor performances are probably attributed to the formation of p\u2013n heterojunctions between p-type NiO and n-type SnO 2 . It also suggests that the Ni-dopant is a promising substitute for noble metal additives to fabricate sensor materials with a low cost.",

        "abstract": "Porous alpha-Fe(2)O(3) was synthesized by simple calcination of a beta-FeOOH precursor derived from a facile hydrothermal method. In the hydrothermal process, only FeCl(3).6H(2)O was used as the source material and no templates or pore-directing agents were needed. The as-prepared porous alpha-Fe(2)O(3) was further employed as a support for loading Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Due to the advantages of porous nanostructures (large surface area and facile gas diffusion) and the catalytic capability of AuNPs, the derived AuNP-supported porous alpha-Fe(2)O(3) was further investigated for gas sensor applications using ethanol as a probe molecule. Obtained results showed that the AuNP-supported porous alpha-Fe(2)O(3) exhibited a much higher response in comparison to pure alpha-Fe(2)O(3). The enhanced sensor properties are attributed to the unique porous structures of the alpha-Fe(2)O(3) support and active AuNPs for promoting sensing reactions, as well as the synergic electronic interaction between Au and alpha-Fe(2)O(3). It is expected that noble metals such as Ag, Pt and Pd can also be supported on other porous metal oxide semiconductors to explore superior properties of functional nanomaterials.",

The ZnO shell coated on the nanospindles has a thickness of 10-15 nm. Considering that both \u03b1-Fe(2)O(3) and ZnO are good sensing materials, we have investigated the gas sensing performances of the core-shell nanocomposite using ethanol as the main probe gas. It is interesting to find that the gas sensor properties of the core-shell nanospindles are significantly enhanced compared with pristine \u03b1-Fe(2)O(3). The enhanced sensor properties are attributed to the unique core-shell nanostructure. The detailed sensing mechanism is discussed with respect to the energy band structure and the electron depletion theory. The core-shell nanostructure reported in this work provides a new path to fabricate highly sensitive materials for gas sensing applications.",

The samples were characterized by means of TG-DTA,XRD,H 2-TPR and XPS. The catalytic activity of the CuO/TiO2-SnO2 catalysts was markedly depended on the loading of CuO,and the optimum CuO loading was 8 wt.%(T 100 = 80 C) . The CuO/TiO2-SnO2 catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the CuO/TiO 2 and CuO/SnO 2 catalysts. H 2-TPR result indicated that a large amount of CuO formed the active site for CO oxidation in 8 wt.% CuO/TiO2-SnO2 catalyst.",

Among these identified components, the octadecatrienoic acid methyl esters were major components in the unprocessed flowers, while some aromatic aldehydes and ketones, such as benzeneacetaldehyde and 1-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-ethanone, were prominent components in the flowers both dried in the fluidized bed and in shadow. In addition, the flowers dried in the fluidized bed were more fragrant than other flowers.The component and contents closely related to their processing mode, and the fluided bed drying may be a best choice to process the flowers of F. thunbergii.",

In this work, a novel multi-channel recycling counter-current chromatography (CCC) was successfully established and three representative three-channel recycling CCC systems including 1R, 2R, and 3R CCC recycling on one, two, and three channel columns were developed for four typical tanshinones fractions. The results demonstrated that all recycling CCC separations were efficient for the isolation of targeted tanshinones. 1R CCC not only provided the single recycling separation, but also offered two parallel recycling separation or repeated preparation for multiple targets. 2R CCC provided the increased peak resolution and less risk of overlapping. 3R CCC offered versatile elution and recycling modes for multiple targets. Compared to 1R and 2R CCC, 3R CCC was easier to separate the more complex natural products with more targets in the complex natural extracts. In summary, the developed multi-channel recycling CCC systems including 1R, 2R, and 3R CCC were successful and efficient for resolving the complex natural tanshinones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first document to report the multi-channel recycling CCC methods for the separation of tanshinones. They may be used as new multi-dimensional recycling CCC for targeted and non-targeted isolation of natural products. It may be widely used for current natural drug development and metabolome analysis.",

In this work, a novel multi-channel multi-dimensional counter-current chromatography (CCC) has been successfully constructed and used for several two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CCC separations including 2D A\u00d7B/A\u00d7C, A\u00d7B-C and A-B\u00d7C, and 3D A\u00d7B\u00d7C systems. These 2D and 3D CCC systems were further applied to separate the bioactive tanshinones from the extract of Tanshen (or Danshen, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), a famous Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). As a result, the developed 2D and 3D CCC methods were successful and efficient for resolving the tanshinones from complex extracts. Compared to the 1D multiple columns CCC separation, the 2D and 3D CCC decrease analysis time, reduce solvent consumption and increase sample throughput significantly. It may be widely used for current drug development, metabolomic analysis and natural product isolation.",

Thus a two-dimensional gray entropy thresholding method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) with high speed convergence or decomposition is proposed. Firstly, gray entropy is defined and the corresponding formulae for threshold selection based on two-dimensional gray entropy is derived.

A novel fusion method is proposed in this paper based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and region segmentation. Firstly, the multispectral image is transformed to intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) system. Secondly, the panchromatic image and the component intensity of the multispectral image are decomposed by NSCT. Then the NSCT coefficients of high and low frequency subbands are fused by different rules, respectively. For the high frequency subbands, the fusion rules are also unalike in the smooth and edge regions. The two regions are segregated in the panchromatic image, and the segmentation is based on particle swarm optimization. Finally, the fusion image can be obtained by performing inverse NSCT and inverse IHS transform. The experimental results are evaluated by both subjective and objective criteria. It is shown that the proposed method can obtain superior results to others. \u00a9 2011 Shanghai Jiaotong University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Next, a threshold selection method based on recursive maximum between-cluster absolute difference is presented to segment the residual image. Finally, the real small target is detected based on the stability of target gray and the consistency of target trajectory. Experimental results and analyses are given, which are compared with those of three existing small target detection methods based on background predication.

To solve the problems that the image segmentation accuracy of simple KFCM clustering method is not high enough, and traditional CV model is sensitive to the initial condition and has low convergence speed, a marine spill oil SAR image segmentation method based on KFCM clustering and improved CV model is proposed. Firstly, the marine spill oil SAR images are mapped into high dimensional feature space from original sample space using KFCM algorithm, and the clustering results are obtained. Then the clustering results are served as the initial condition of the CV model to reduce the sensitivity to the initial condition. The Dirac function in traditional CV model is replaced with the image edge intensity, so as to improve the convergence speed and adaptability to different SAR images. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed method based on KFCM clustering and improved CV model for marine spill oil SAR image segmentation has the advantages of high segmentation accuracy and fast computational speed.",

Firstly, the host image is decomposed by the contourlet transform. Then, the non-linear local correlation model of the image is established using the support vector machine. The watermark is adaptively embedded according to the prediction result of the established model. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is not only invisible and robust against the common image signal processing, such as noise adding, JPEG compression, sharpening, smoothing filtering and contrast enhancement, but also robust against the geometric attacks, such as rotation, shearing and distortion. Especially, its performance is significantly superior to the image watermarking schemes in spatial domain or wavelet domain based on the support vector machine.",

The existing two-dimensional Tsallis cross entropy method is not the strict two-dimensional extension. Thus two new methods of image thresholding using two-dimensional Tsallis cross entropy based on either Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) or decomposition are proposed. The former uses CPSO to find the optimal threshold. The recursive algorithm is adopted to avoid the repetitive computation of fitness function in iterative procedure. The computing speed is improved greatly. The latter converts the two-dimensional computation into two one-dimensional spaces, which makes the computational complexity further reduced from O(L2) to O(L). The experimental results show that, compared with the proposed recently two-dimensional Shannon or Tsallis cross entropy method, the two new methods can achieve superior segmentation results and reduce running time greatly.",

To improve their adaptability and universality, an infrared image enhancement method based on contourlet transform and chaotic particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The low frequency subband after contourlet transform is adaptively enhanced by a method based on local mean and standard deviation, which improves the overall contrast of image. The high frequency subbands are enhanced by a general nonlinear gain function, which improve the local contrast of weak details. The chaotic particle swarm optimization is used to search the optimal parameters during the above-mentioned low and high frequency subband enhancement. Experiments with qualitative and quantitative evaluation are carried out for a large number of images, and the proposed method is compared with histogram double equalization method, second-generation wavelet transform method, stationary wavelet transform method and curvelet transform method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can enhance image details and suppress noise better, and the whole visual effect is improved significantly.",

Methods: The viability of MGC803 cells was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis of MGC803 cells was observed by AO/EB fluorescence microscopy and detected by flow cytometry with PI staining. Expression of p38MAPK and phosphorylated p38 (pp38) MAPK were determined by Western blot analysis. Results: EGCG induced apoptosis of MGC803 cells and apparently increased the activity of pp38MAPK in MGC803 cells. However, after interference with pp38MAPK inhibitor, the inhibitory effect of EGCG on MGC803 cells was significantly weakened. The apoptotic rate of the cells and the activity of pp38MAPK also decreased dramatically. Conclusions:EGCG can induce apoptosis of MGC803 cells. The effects could be markedly suppressed by pp38MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. EGCG induces apoptosis of MGC803 cells partly by activating p38 MAPK.",

Methods:By using immunohistology, the expression of NF-\u03baB and Ki-67 in 62 cases of thyroid cancer, 20 cases of thyrophyma and 10 cases of normal thyroid tissue was determined. Results:The expression of NF-\u03baB and Ki-67 in thyroid cancer was obviously higher than that in thyrophyma and normal thyroid tissue (P<0.01). The positive expression of NF-\u03baB in thyroid cancer had relation with the pathological type of thyroid cancer. The positive expression of Ki-67 in undifferentiated thyroid cancer was clearly higher than that in differentiated thyroid cancer (P<0.01). The positive expression of NF-\u03baB and Ki-67 of the lymphatic metastasis group of the thyroid cancer was higher than that of non-metastasis thyroid cancer(P<0.01). Conclusion:The expression of NF-\u03baB and Ki-67 in thyroid cancer was enhanced clearly and can be used as the evidence of the differential diagnosis of the benign or malignant thyrophyma.

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the proliferation of human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells and to elucidate the possible mechanism. Methods: The proliferation inhibitory rates of BGC-823 cells treated with different concentrations of EGCG alone or in combination with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 were detected by MTT assay. The morphological changes of BGC-823 cells were observed under a microscope. The apoptosis rate of BGC-823 cells was determined by flow cytometry. The expression levels of p-JNK and p-c-jun proteins in BGC-823 cells were examined by Western blotting. The expression level of caspase-3 protein was detected by immunocytochemistry. Results: EGCG inhibited the proliferation of BGC-823 cells in dose-and time-dependent manners (P<0.05). EGCG induced the apoptosis of BGC-823 cells in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The expression levels of p-JNK, p-c-jun and caspase-3 proteins in BGC-823 cells were up-regulated by EGCG (P<0.05). The effects of EGCG on the proliferation inhibition and up-regulation of caspase-3 expression were partly inhibited by SP600125. Conclusion: EGCG can induce the apoptosis of BGC-823 cells. This effect may be associated with the activation of JNK transduction pathway and the up-regulation of caspase-3 expression.",

It revealed that the viscosity curve of cassava paste was in the line with the typical curve of starch gelatinization,and the viscosity was increasing with the rising of concetration. With the same starch content,cassava starch paste gelatinized faster than the cassava paste and keeped a higher peak viscosity. The peak viscosity was effectively decreased by adding liquification enzyme before gelatinizing. When adding 10u/g cassava flour liquification enzyme,the peak viscosities of cassva paste corresponded to 10%(vol)and 15%(vol)alcohol were only 3. 26% and 6. 52% of the one which corresponded to 10%(vol)alcohol not adding liquification enzyme.",

        "abstract": "Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor in adults and often metastasizes to the liver, leaving patients with few options. Recurrent activating mutations in the G proteins, G\u03b1q and G\u03b111, are observed in approximately 93% of all uveal melanomas. While therapeutic intervention of downstream G\u03b1q/11 targets has been unsuccessful in treating uveal melanoma, we have found that the G\u03b1q/11 inhibitor, FR900359 (FR), effectively inhibits oncogenic G\u03b1q/11 signaling in uveal melanoma cells expressing either mutant G\u03b1q or G\u03b111. Inhibition of oncogenic G\u03b1q/11 by FR results in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, colony formation is prevented by FR treatment of uveal melanoma cells in 3D-cell culture, providing promise for future in vivo studies. This suggests direct inhibition of activating G\u03b1q/11 mutants may be a potential means of treating uveal melanoma. Implications: Oncogenic G\u03b1q/11 inhibition by FR900359 may be a potential treatment option for those with uveal melanoma.",

        "abstract": "Cryptotanshinone is a natural abietane type-diterpene quinine isolated from the lipophilic extract of Tanshen (or Danshen, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) which is widely used in clinical applications for treating inflammations such as acne, tonsillitis and mastitis at present. Previous studies indicated that cryptotanshinone could not only inhibit the growth of androgen dependent and castration resistant prostate cancer cells by suppressing the androgen receptor (AR), but also inhibit estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell proliferation by suppressing ER signals. In this work, we found cryptotanshinone can effectively inhibit the proliferation of ER-negative breast cancer Bcap37 cells. Cryptotanshinone induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through changes in nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-like activities and translocation of endonuclease G (EndoG) from mitochondria into nucleus. During the process, the caspases inhibitor could not completely abrogate apoptosis caused by cryptotanshinone, suggesting that the intrinsic caspase-independent signaling functioned was one of the major pathways under high stress of cryptotanshinone. In addition, the apoptosis involved several key signals of cell proliferation and ROS regulation, such as suppression of PTEN and up-regulation of phosphorylated-AKT (Ser 473), thus the expression of a key transcription factor FOXO1 was down-regulated further and resulted in accumulation of ROS that brought about the following oxidative DNA damage. In summary, the results showed that cryptotanshinone might be a promising apoptosis-inducing agent in the treatment of ER-negative breast cancers by activation of mitochondria-derived ROS/FOXO1 signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Counter-current chromatography is an efficient and practical liquid\u2013liquid chromatography technique for the separation and purification of complex mixtures such as natural product extracts and synthetic chemicals. However, counter-current chromatography is a challenging approach and requires special knowledge, especially for selection of the solvent system, which may be estimated as 90% of the entire amount of work. In this work, we introduced a sugaring-out strategy for optimizing two-phase solvent systems for counter-current chromatography by using sugars as additives. Thirteen podophyllotoxins and flavones in the extract of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Dysosma versipellis were selected as model compounds, and nine sugars, including sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, D-galactose, D-sorbose, mannose, rhamnose, and xylopyranose, were selected as modifiers added into the two-phase solvent systems. As a result, we found that almost all of the sugars used in this work could increase the values of the partition coefficients of almost all of targets in the two-phase hexane\u2013ethyl acetate\u2013methanol\u2013water solvent systems. In addition, sugars with different chemical structures seemed to have different sugaring-out effects on the resolution and selective separation of some components of Dysosma versipellis, although they were able to increase the partition coefficients of several components. Therefore, it may be an alternative strategy to quickly obtain an optimal two-phase solvent system by adding some sugars into the selected two-phase solvent system. This method is very simple and efficient for the separation and purification of single or multiple targets from natural products.",

However, CCC separation is still a challenging process and the selection of appropriate solvent system for separation of target compound(s) is still relatively time-consuming. In this work, we introduced a room temperature ionic liquids-based salting-in strategy for the rapid selection of suitable solvent systems for CCC separation. In the randomly selected solvent systems, such as ethyl acetate-water, n-butanol-water, n-pentanol-water, n-hexanol-water, and n-octanol-water, several ionic liquids such as [AMIM]Cl, [MAMIM]Cl, and [BMIM]Cl can increase the solubility of the solutes in the lower phase, which made a dose-dependent decreasing of partition coefficient of solute in the two-phase solvent system. Thus, it is possible to get a suitable solvent system with sweet K spot such as K=1 only by adding some ionic liquids into the systems. As an example, arctiin, a bioactive lignin component of the fruit of Arctium lappa. L. (Niubangzi in Chinese), was selected and successfully separated by CCC with room temperature ionic liquids-based n-butanol-water systems. It seems a very efficient alternative strategy for the optimization of solvent systems for CCC separation of natural products.",

In this study, we provided an updated example by using an ionic liquid-based salting-in counter-current chromatography (CCC) strategy for the separation of hydrophobic tanshinones without subsequent column chromatography purification. Several ionic liquids such as 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([AMIM]Cl), 1-methallyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([MAMIM]Cl) and 1-butyl-3-ethylimidazolium chloride [BMIM]Cl could significantly decrease the partition coefficients (K) of tanshinones in the selected two-phase solvent composed of hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-ionic liquid aqueous solution (5:5:6:4, v/v). Typically, K values of three target tanshinones including tanshinone I, 1,2-dihydrotanshinquione and tanshinone IIA were reduced from 3.57, 4.57 and 5.50 to 1.62, 2.33 and 3.08, respectively, by the inclusion of 10% [AMIM]Cl in the solvent system. After salting-in CCC separation, the purified tanshinones were obtained only by simple ethyl acetate extraction. In general, the current results demonstrated that the ionic liquid-based salting-in CCC may be as an alternative strategy for the optimization of CCC solvent systems and separation of lipophilic natural products.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Room ionic liquids (ILs) used as green solvents have received considerable attention and wide application in different research and industrial fields, such as chemistry, biology, catalysis, energy, and even environmental sciences. Recently, a new class of sustainable solvents named deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been developed, which share the promising solvent characteristics of ILs, such as thermal and chemical stability, low vapor pressure and design ability. In addition, the major advantages of DESs over ILs are their lower prices and easier preparation. Therefore, DESs have been considered to be a potential alternative to replace conventional organic solvents and ILs. Currently, the developed DESs may be classified into ionic and nonionic liquids. Typically, choline chloride (ChCl)/urea (1:2) is an ionic DES, while glucose/sucrose (1:1) is a nonionic DES. Although several reviews have covered advancements in DESs, in this review, we aim to provide a general insight into DESs, particularly ionic DESs, like choline-based DES, in terms of their preparation and application in the extraction of natural products (NPs) mainly from traditional Chinese medicines and the recovery of extracted compounds from their extracts. Additionally, various factors affecting the extraction efficiency of DESs are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Counter-current chromatography (CCC) is an efficient liquid-liquid partition chromatography technique without support matrix. Despite there are many significant advancements in the CCC separation of natural products especially for non-ionic neutral compounds, CCC isolation of ionic compounds including alkaloids is still a challenging process guide by classical partition coefficients (K) or distribution ratio (K) because their partition coefficient could not be equal to distribution ratio in common ionic conditions. Here, taking the extract of embryo of the seed of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn as sample, we introduced a modified K-targeted strategy for isolation of phenolic alkaloids by use of lysine as a pH regulator. The results indicated that if the mass of basic regulators such as aqueous ammonia and lysine added into the solvent system were high enough to inhibit the ionization of the targeted alkaloids, the distribution ratio of targets with ionic and non-ionic molecular forms got stable and might not been changed as the concentration of the pH regulator. In this case, the distribution ratio of target was almost equal to the partition coefficient. Thus, the targets could be isolated by K-targeted CCC separation through adding a certain amount pH regulators into the solvent system. Further experiments also showed that the sample concentration was an important factor on the distribution ratio of targets. Meanwhile, CCC experiments indicated that lysine was more suitable than aqueous ammonia for the separation of phenolic alkaloids because the chemical property of lysine-target complex in the CCC fractions was more stable. Therefore, the preparative CCC separation was performed using 20mM lysine as a pH regulator with more than 800mg injection mass. After simple back-extraction with dichloromethane, the lysine in the CCC fraction was removed completely and pure isoliensinine and neferine were obtained. In summary, the whole results indicated that the modified K-targeted CCC strategy using lysine as the pH regulator was efficient for isolation of phenolic alkaloids from crude plant extracts. It not only provided a practical strategy for the isolation of neferine and its analogues, but also introduced a powerful method to resolve the peak skewing (leading or tailing) in CCC separation of ionic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The bud of  Dendranthema lavandulifolium  (Jumi) is a featured agricultural product in Zhejiang Province (China) with active effects on liver detoxing and vision improvement. In order to evaluate the quality and identify geographical origin of Jumi, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chemical fingerprinting method was developed for simultaneous detection of multi-target components. Among the 16 common peaks in the fingerprint, 6 phenylpropanoids, 5 flavonoids and 2 volatile compounds were identified through combinational analytical applications of ultraviolet spectrum (UV), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). Phenylpropanoids and flavonoids were found to be the major potential antioxidants in Jumi based on the pre-column DPPH-HPLC assay. For simultaneous analysis of multi-target components, HPLC quantitative method was constructed by using 11 identified compounds. The results demonstrated that the chemical compositions and contents among 10 batches of Jumi are consistent. 6 phenylpropanoids and 3 flavonoids appeared as the main constituents in Jumi and showed obviously higher contents (u003e1\u2009mg/g). Especially, the contents of two flavanones, eriodictyol-7- O-\u03b2 - d -glucuronide and eriodictyol-7- O-\u03b2 - d -glucoside are prominent in Jumi. The principal component analysis (PCA) suggests obvious differences between Jumi and other cultivars buds. Eriodictyol-7- O-\u03b2 - d -glucuronide, isochlorogenic acid A (3, 5-diCQA), chlorogenic acid (3-CQA), and isochlorogenic acid C (4, 5-diCQA) can be used as the specific target components to distinguish Jumi from other buds.",

This study aimed to investigate the herb-markers and their antioxidant activities in methanolic extracts of D. catenatum flowers, and to establish the quality evaluation methods for raw materials and their products of flower by HPLC. The methanolic extract of 11 strains of D. catenatum flowers were found to contain a high content of total phenol and flavonoids, and they possessed potential antioxidant capacities based on DPPH radical scavenging assay. A total of 21 phenolic herb-markers were selected according to the similarity and principal component analysis of the chromatographic fingerprinting profiles. Their structures were further elucidated by UV, HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS and NMR analyses. The identified compounds included 2 phenylpropanoids, 11C-glycosylflavones and 6 O-glycosylflavones, which could be employed as the indicators for quantitative evaluation of the quality and authenticity of the flowers. Based on the pre-column DPPH/ABTS-HPLC analysis, the major compounds contributed to the antioxidative activity were identified as 1-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucoside, rutin and isoquercitrin, all of which, were also the most abundant constituents in the methanolic extract. The results suggest the potential of D. catenatum flowers as a new antioxidant resources for medicinal and food products.",

        "abstract": "Despite of substantial developments of extraction and separation techniques, isolation of natural products from natural resources is still a challenging task. In this work, an efficient strategy for extraction and isolation of multi-component natural products has been successfully developed by combination of systematic two-phase liquid-liquid extraction-(13)C NMR pattern recognition and following conical counter-current chromatography separation. A small-scale crude sample was first distributed into 9 systematic hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (HEMWat) two-phase solvent systems for determination of the optimum extraction solvents and partition coefficients of the prominent components. Then, the optimized solvent systems were used in succession to enrich the hydrophilic and lipophilic components from the large-scale crude sample. At last, the enriched components samples were further purified by a new conical counter-current chromatography (CCC). Due to the use of (13)C NMR pattern recognition, the kinds and structures of major components in the solvent extracts could be predicted. Therefore, the method could collect simultaneously the partition coefficients and the structural information of components in the selected two-phase solvents. As an example, a cytotoxic extract of podophyllotoxins and flavonoids from Dysosma versipellis (Hance) was selected. After the systematic HEMWat system solvent extraction and (13)C NMR pattern recognition analyses, the crude extract of D. versipellis was first degreased by the upper phase of HEMWat system (9:1:9:1, v/v), and then distributed in the two phases of the system of HEMWat (2:8:2:8, v/v) to obtain the hydrophilic lower phase extract and lipophilic upper phase extract, respectively. These extracts were further separated by conical CCC with the HEMWat systems (1:9:1:9 and 4:6:4:6, v/v). As results, total 17 cytotoxic compounds were isolated and identified. In general, whole results suggested that the strategy was very efficient for the systematic extraction and isolation of biological active components from the complex biomaterials.",

Since the helical coil planet centrifuge was invented in early 1970s by Yoichiro Ito, a series of coils columns, including spiral coils and conical coils columns have been developed for CCC separation. In this work, we introduced a new simple and efficient concentrical coils column for CCC separation, which was prepared by winding the whole polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube into the circular grooves from the rotation axis in the same direction. Once the PTFE tube filled in all space of one round of the circular groove, it was jumped into the nearby outer circular groove through the gap and until the whole groove was filled. The three same concentrical coils distributed on three disc-shaped holders were connected by the same PTFE tube to form concentrical coils separation column. The separation capacity was further investigated using ten tanshinones of the extracts of a Traditional Chinese Medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge as a model natural product. All results indicated that the concentrical coils column could hold satisfactory retention of the stationary phase, higher theoretical plate number and better resolution for CCC separation of more than ten tanshinones. It may be an alternative CCC column for non-targeted and targeted isolation of bioactive natural products.",

There was a strong positive correlation between DPPH radical scavenging rate and total flavonoids content. Furthermore, the antioxidant principles were determined by combination use of DPPH/ABTS + -HPLC assays and HPLC-DAD-based pattern recognition technologies. Their structure was further identified by on-line and off-line HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and following targeted isolation and NMR recognition. 14 phenolic herber-markers including quercetin-type flavonols and apigenin-type flavones were characterized from the leaves of  D. officinale . The major flavonoid component of leaves was rutin and its content ranged from 1.33 to 2.89\u00a0mg\u00b7g \u2212  1  dry weight. In summary, whole results indicated that the leaves of  D. officinale  might be developed as antioxidant sources for medicinal and health food resources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The graphene-coated carbon fiber cloth (CC@Gr) anchored with nanosized Co 3 O 4  particles was successfully fabricated. According to the results of structural characterization, it was observed that the graphene-coated carbon fibers are able to anchor much higher amount of Co 3 O 4  nanoparticles than graphene-free carbon fibers. The composite was applied as free-standing anode for lithium ion batteries, and it exhibits enhanced energy storage capability. A high reversible specific capacity of nearly 400\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at a current density of 100\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121  can be achieved based on the total mass of Co 3 O 4  and CC@Gr fibers (mass ratio\u00a0=\u00a016:84). In addition, the composite demonstrates excellent rate performance and superior cycling stability.",

        "abstract": "Polyacrylonitrile nanofiber cloth coated with graphene oxide was carbonized and activated to fabricate nitrogen- and oxygen-enriched porous carbon/graphene (NAC@Gr) sandwich-like composites. The influence of graphene coating on the microstructure, surface composition, and supercapacitive performance of the as-prepared composites was investigated. The results indicated that significantly enhanced energy storage capability can be achieved due to the high specific surface area, optimized pore structure, and surface functionality. The composites show both high gravimetric and volumetric specific capacitances, for example, 380 F g\u22121 (178 F cm\u22123) at 0.1 A g\u22121 in 6 M KOH and 228 F g\u22121 (125 F cm\u22123) at 1 A g\u22121 in 1 M TEABF4/AN electrolyte. The assembled symmetric supercapacitors exhibit high energy density, high power density, excellent cycling stability, and high-rate performance.",

        "abstract": "(Ba0.3Sr0.7)(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 (BSZN) dielectric ceramic thin films were fabricated on Pt(111)/Ti/SiO2/Si(100) substrates by sol\u2013gel method followed by annealing in O2 atmosphere at different temperatures. The effects of annealing temperatures on the crystalline quality of the ceramic thin films have been investigated in brief. Scanning electron microscope shows that the surface morphologies of the samples are crack-free and compact with well-crystallized structures. The grain sizes of the thin films annealed at different temperatures increase with the increase in the annealing temperatures from 700 to 900\u00a0\u00b0C. The XRD results showed that the sample at 900\u00a0\u00b0C exhibits well-crystallized structures with the strongest intensity of the main phases. The surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the samples decrease with the increase in the annealing temperatures. The thin film possesses the minimum RMS value when the annealing temperature is 900\u00a0\u00b0C, whose crystalline quality is the highest in all samples. In short, 900\u00a0\u00b0C is of the optimal annealing temperature with best dielectric properties. The dielectric constant and loss tangent of the sample annealed at 900\u00a0\u00b0C are 38.5 and 0.005 at 10\u00a0kHz, respectively.",
