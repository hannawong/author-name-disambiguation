In the application of road surface 3D reconstruction with vehicle-borne laser scanner, the balleting of moving vehicle can induce the distortion of the road surface points cloud. On this ground, the line-estimation algorithm based on RANSAC was used to get the slope coefficient of scan lines. After that, the anomalous fluctuation of road points cloud was removed. Experiment result shows that, the fluctuation amplitude of road points cloud before optimization induced by balleting of moving vehicle was 0.6 m. After optimization, the fluctuation amplitude of road points cloud was less than 0.04 m. The three-dimensional shape reconstruction effect of road surface was improved after arithmetic optimization. Besides, running the optimization arithmetic took 11 seconds. Therefore, the point cloud optimization method on road surface proposed in this paper has the advantage of simple principle, convenient using, high-speed calculation. The 3D reconstruction effect meets the requirement in practice.",

        "abstract": "The inverse perspective mapping (IPM) algorithm existing can only be used to the condition that the camera attitude does not change. The balleting of the vehicle during moving will bring variation to the camera attitude,and the IPM algorithm existing will induce error. Consequently,a real time IPM method is proposed. This paper used attitude sensor to measure the camera attitude in real time, and deduces the relational matrix between camera coordinates and the road surface coordinates by the attitude data of camera, then the top views of the road surface is got. Experiment result showed that the IPM error caused by the new method was less than 0. 8% while the camera attitude was arbitrary. Compared with traditional method,the distortion of road image mosaic is less when the camera is affected by the balleting of the vehicle outdoor. Therefore, the method proposed can not only get highprecision top views of the road surface in the situation of balleting of camera, but also can be applied to the detection of foreign object debris on airport runway and the reconnaissance of damage to the highway.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis is one of the most common complications of paraquat (PQ) poisoning, which demands for more effective therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests adiponectin (APN) may be a promising therapy against fibrotic diseases. In the current study, we determine whether the exogenous globular APN isoform protects against pulmonary fibrosis in PQ-treated mice and human lung fibroblasts, and dissect the responsible underlying mechanisms. BALB/C mice were divided into control group, PQ group, PQ + low-dose APN group, and PQ + high-dose APN group. Mice were sacrificed 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after PQ treatment. We compared pulmonary histopathological changes among different groups on the basis of fibrosis scores, TGF-\u03b21, CTGF and \u03b1-SMA pulmonary content via Western blot and real-time quantitative fluorescence-PCR (RT-PCR). Blood levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were determined by ELISA. Human lung fibroblasts WI-38 were divided into control group, PQ group, APN group, and APN receptor (AdipoR) 1 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) group. Fibroblasts were collected 24, 48, and 72 hours after PQ exposure for assay. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined via Kit-8 (CCK-8) and fluorescein Annexin V-FITC/PI double labeling. The protein and mRNA expression level of collagen type III, AdipoR1, and AdipoR2 were measured by Western blot and RT-PCR. APN treatment significantly decreased the lung fibrosis scores, protein and mRNA expression of pulmonary TGF-\u03b21, CTGF and \u03b1-SMA content, and blood MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (p&amp;lt;0.05). Pretreatment with APN significantly attenuated the reduced cell viability and up-regulated collagen type III expression induced by PQ in lung fibroblasts, (p&amp;lt;0.05). APN pretreatment up-regulated AdipoR1, but not AdipoR2, expression in WI-38 fibroblasts. AdipoR1 siRNA abrogated APN-mediated protective effects in PQ-exposed fibroblasts. Taken together, our data suggests APN protects against PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, via suppression of lung fibroblast activation. Functional AdipoR1 are expressed by human WI-38 lung fibroblasts, suggesting potential future clinical applicability of APN against pulmonary fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of ulinastatin treatment on adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Seven electronic databases were searched for reports of randomized, controlled trials conducted up to February 2014 in which patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were administered ulinastatin in the perioperative period.Fifty-two studies with 2025 patients were retained for analysis. The results showed that the ulinastatin can attenuate the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Meanwhile, the ulinastatin had a significant beneficial effect on myocardial injury. The mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of biochemical markers were -63.54 (-79.36, -47.72) for lactate dehydrogenase, -224.99 (-304.83, -145.14) for creatine kinase, -8.75 (-14.23, -3.28) for creatine kinase-MB, and -0.14 (-0.20, -0.09] for troponin I (all P&amp;lt;0.01). However, neither hemodynamics nor cardiac function improved significantly, except that the MD and 95% CI of mean arterial pressure were 2.50 (0.19, 4.80) (P\u200a=\u200a0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in the use of inotropes, postoperative bleeding, postoperative complications, the intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and the hospital stay; however, the frequency of auto resuscitation increased significantly (OR 1.98, 95%CI 1.19 to 3.30, P&amp;lt;0.01), the duration of intubation (MD -1.58, 95%CI -2.84 to -0.32, P&amp;lt;0.01) and the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -3.29, 95%CI -4.41 to -2.17, P&amp;lt;0.01) shortened significantly in patients who were treated with ulinastatin.Ulinastatin can reduce the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and elevate anti-inflammatory cytokine in patients from China and Japan undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Ulinastatin treatment may have protective effects on myocardial injury, and can increase the frequency of auto resuscitation, shorten the duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

Although oxidative stress has been established as an important mechanism underlying PQ toxicity, multiple antioxidants have proven ineffective in attenuating the deleterious effects of PQ. Adiponectin, which shows anti-oxidative and antinitrative effects, may have the potential to reduce PQ-mediated injury. The present study determined the protective action of globular domain adiponectin (gAd) on PQ-induced lung injury, and attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism or mechanisms of action. BALB/c mice were administered PQ, with and without 12 or 36 h of gAd pre-treatment. The pulmonary oxidative/nitrative status was assessed by measuring pulmonary O2 (\u2022-), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and 8-hydroxy-2-dydeoxy guanosine (8-OHdG) production, and blood 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT). At a dose of 20 mg/kg, PQ markedly increased O2 (\u2022-), SOD, MDA, NO and 8-OHdG production 3 h post-administration, but did not significantly increase 3-NT levels until 12 h. gAd inhibited these changes in a dose-dependent manner, via transient activation of MDA, followed by attenuation of MDA formation from 6 h onwards. Histological analysis demonstrated that gAd decreased interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. These results suggest that gAd protects against PQ-induced lung injury by mitigating oxidative/nitrative stress. Furthermore, gAd may be a potential therapeutic agent for PQ-induced lung injury, and further pharmacological studies are therefore warranted.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the clinical characteristics of patients with severe pandemic H1N1 Influenza in Sichuan and risk factors related to patients\u2019 prognosis. Methods We observed 135 severe patients who came to hospitals for pandemic H1N1 Influenza from 12 cities in Sichuan,China,between September 12,2009 to December 14,2009,and described their baseline characteristics,treatment,and outcomes.A stepwise multiple Logistic-regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent predictors of death. Results Of the 135 patients we studied,86 patients were male. The average age was (28.2\u00b119.3)years old,while patients between 19 to 45 years of age accounted for 47.4%. 96 patients(71.1%) presented with fever. 51 patients(37.8%) had comorbid conditions. The most frequent organ dysfunction was seen in lung(71.1%),liver(27.4%)and cardia(24.4%);130 patients(96.3%) had received oseltamivir,26 patients (19.3%) required mechanical ventilation. 12 of the 135 patients died. Compared with the survivors,patients who died were more likely to have a higher age,lower average blood pressure when admitted,more organ dysfunction,and more likely to have cardia or nervous system dysfunction. The nonsurvivors also seemed to have less opportunity to be exposed to neuraminidase inhibitors,and have more demand for mechanical ventilation.The P value were all under 0.05. The multiple Logistic-regression analysis showed the independent predictors of death were the average blood pressure when admitted and the demand for mechanical ventilation .The P value were both under 0.05. The OR value was 0.86(95%CI 0.002-0.936)and 13.86(95%CI 1.146-16.583),respectively. Conclusions For these severe patients with pandemic H1N1 Influenza we study,the male patients are more than female. Most patients are between 19 to 45 years of age. The most frequent organ dysfunction is seen in lung,liver and cardia. The mortality of these patients is 8.9%. Compared with the survivors,patients who died were more likely to have a higher age,lower average blood pressure when admitted,more organ dysfunction,and more likely to have cardia or nervous system dysfunction.

        "abstract": "To investigate the performance of revised trauma score (RTS), CRAMS score (circulation, respiration, abdomen, motor and speech) and prehospital index (PHI) on evaluation of injury severity in earthquake victims.Data of victims admitted to West China Hospital of Sichuan University during the Lushan earthquake from April 20th, 2013, to April 27th were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical information at admission was recorded, and the injury severity score (ISS), RTS, CRAMS and PHI were calculated. The optimal cut-off values were looked for, the comparability between the three scores and ISS score were figured out by receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve), and the correlation between ISS and three scores was analyzed by linear regression analysis.There was a total of 263 victims included in the study. ISS \u2265 16 was found in 86 cases, and ISS<16 in 177 victims, and there were significant statistic differences in male ratio (67.4% vs. 50.8%, \u03c7\u00b2 = 6.477, P=0.011), RTS score [7.55 (0.29) vs. 7.84 (0), U=6 825, P=0.013] and CRAMS scores [8 (1) vs. 9 (1), U=3 977, P=0.000] between two groups. It was showed by ROC curve analysis that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of RTS, CRAMS and PHI was 0.547 (P=0.220), 0.734 (P=0.000) and 0.544 (P=0.250), and the Youden indexes of the three scores were 0.093, 0.443, and 0.119, respectively. Moreover, the best cut-off values of them were 4.9, 9.5 and 3.5. Linear regression analysis showed that RTS and CRAMS score showed negative correlation with ISS score (r\u2081=-0.139, P\u2081=0.024; r\u2082=-0.413, P\u2082=0.000), while PHI showed no relationship with it (r=0.071, P=0.250).Of these three scoring systems, CRAMS has the best correlation with ISS, and it can be used in the prompt assessment of trauma severity in earthquake victims.",

        "abstract": "Many prognostic indictors have been studied to evaluate the prognosis of paraquat poisoning. However, the optimal indicator remains unclear. To determine the value of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, the Severity Index of Paraquat Poisoning (SIPP), and serum lactate levels in the prognosis of paraquat poisoning, we performed a prospective study that enrolled 143 paraquat patients. Data were collected from patients (161) at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China, including details about the patients' general conditions, laboratory examinations, and treatment. Receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting inpatient mortality based on APACHE II score, SIPP, and lactate levels were generated. To analyze the best cutoff values for lactate levels, APACHE II scores, and SIPP in predicting the prognosis of paraquat poisoning, the initial parameters on admission and 7-day survival curves of patients with lactate levels greater than or equal to 2.95 mmol/L, APACHE II score greater than or equal to 15.22, and SIPP greater than or equal to 5.50 h \u00b7 mg/L at the time of arrival at West China Hospital were compared using the 1-way analysis of variance and the log-rank test. The APACHE II score (5.45 [3.67] vs 11.29 [4.31]), SIPP (2.78 [1.89] vs 7.63 [2.46] h \u00b7 mg/L), and lactate level (2.78 [1.89] vs 7.63 [2.46] mmol/L) were significantly lower in survivors (77) after oral ingestion of paraquat, compared with nonsurvivors (66). The APACHE II score, SIPP, and lactate level had different areas under the curve (0.847, 0.789, and 0.916, respectively) and accuracy (0.64, 0.84, and 0.89, respectively). Respiratory rate, serum creatinine level, Paco2, and mortality rate at 7 days after admission in patients with lactate levels greater than or equal to 2.95 mmol/L were markedly different compared with those of other patients (P < 0.05). The predictive value of lactic acid was superior to that of APACHE II score and SIPP for acute oral paraquat poisoning.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that excessive reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)\u2011induced apoptosis is an important feature of the injury to the lung epithelium in paraquat (PQ) poisoning. However the precise mechanisms of PQ\u2011induced dysfunction of the mitochondria, where ROS/RNS are predominantly produced, remain to be fully elucidated. Whether globular adiponectin (gAd), a potent molecule protective to mitochondria, regulates the mitochondrial function of alveolar type II cells to reduce PQ\u2011induced ROS/RNS production remains to be investigated. The current study aimed to investigate the precise mechanisms of PQ poisoning in the mitochondria of alveolar type II cells, and to elucidate the role of gAd in protecting against PQ\u2011induced lung epithelium injury. Therefore, lung epithelial injury was induced by PQ co\u2011culture of alveolar type II A549 cells for 24 h. gAd was administrated to and removed from the injured cells in after 24 h. PQ was observed to reduce cell viability and increase apoptosis by ~1.5 fold in A549 cells. The oxidative/nitrative stress, resulting from ROS/RNS and disordered mitochondrial function were evidenced by increased O2\u2011., NO production and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8), adenosine 5'\u2011triphosphate (ATP) content in PQ\u2011poisoned A549 cells. gAd treatment significantly reversed the PQ\u2011induced cell injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells. The protective effects of gAd were partly abrogated by an adenosine 5'\u2011monophosphate\u2011activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, compound C. The results suggest that reduced \u0394\u03a8 and ATP content may result in PQ\u2011induced mitochondrial dysfunction of the lung epithelium, which constitutes a novel mechanism for gAd exerting pulmonary protection against PQ poisoning via AMPK activation.",

This experiment involved platelet suspensions that were obtained from fasting morning blood specimens from healthy adult male volunteers aged 22 to 28 years. The effect of paclitaxel on platelet aggregation induced by ADP and the inhibition rate of platelet aggregation were calculated in 6 groups with varying concentrations of paclitaxel, respectively. The optimal incubation time and concentration of ADP were 10 minutes and 10 \u03bcmol/mL, respectively. When the concentration of paclitaxel increased, platelet aggregation induced by ADP increased accordingly. When the concentration of paclitaxel exceeded 0.1 ng/mL, the ability of ADP to induce platelet aggregation increased significantly with increasing paclitaxel concentrations. In all the 3 experimental groups, that is A, C, and AC groups, the ability to inhibit platelet aggregation was weakened as paclitaxel concentration increased. Paclitaxel can enhance platelet aggregation induced by ADP, and this ability was observed to increase as paclitaxel concentration increased. In conclusion, paclitaxel can reduce the ability of aspirin, clopidogrel, and aspirin combined with clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the ability to inhibit platelet aggregation was weakened as paclitaxel concentration increased in all 3 experimental groups.",

The activity of NOS in the liver, the activity of serum enzyme LDH and the pathological changes of the liver were assessed at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after I/R. Results At each time point set after I/R, the activity of NOS in the liver of HP+IR group was lower than that of IR group. Maximal HSP70 expression was observed at 12 h after heat pretreatment. While in the HP+IR group, the level of liver enzyme was significantly reduced and the pathological changes were improved in comparison with those in IR group.

Sixty guinea pigs were divided into 6 groups randomly. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was used to observe the change in thresholds and to evaluate ototoxicity induced by streptomycin. Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to observe the effect of TMP on outward K(+) current in isolated outer hair cells. The results showed that TMP attenuated the threshold shift caused by streptomycin and increased the amplitudes of Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) current [I(K(Ca))] in the outer hair cells. The present data suggest that TMP displays anti-ototoxicity induced by streptomycin. The augmented amplitudes of I(K(Ca)) of the outer hair cells induced by TMP may be one of the mechanisms underlying its ototoxicity-attenuating effect.",

Methods Fifteen children of ventricular septal defect aged from four to nine years old were enrolled in the present study. Blood samples were collected simultaneously from the radial artery and jugular bulb respectively at different temperature points during hypothermic and rewarming phase of CPB for blood gas analysis and further calculation of cerebral oxygen consumption,including oxygen content of artery (CaO2),oxygen content of jugular bulb venous (CjvO2),the arterio-venous oxygen content difference (AVDO2)and cerebral extraction rate of oxygen (CEO2). At the same time,the content of blood glucose and lactic acid of the same blood sample were measured. Results Compared with data of baseline,jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2)was significantly higher (P < 0.01)and CaO2,AVDO2 and CEO2 were significantly lower (P < 0.01)during hypothermic phase of CPB. Compared with data of hypothermic phase,SjvO2 was significantly lower (P < 0.01),however,AVDO2 and CEO2 were significantly higher during rewarming phase of CPB (P < 0.01). Conclusion Temperature is an important factor influencing the balance of cerebral oxygen supply and demand during CPB in children of congenital heart disease suffered cardiac surgery. The cerebral oxygen consumption is significantly lower during hypothermic phase,while higher during rewarming phase of CPB. The imbalance of cerebral oxygen supply and demand occurs easily during rewarming phase of CPB.",

Results: Naloxone can limit IL-1\u03b2-induced fever and decrease the content of cAMP and HSP70 expression in hypothalamus (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The present study showed that the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone could inhibit IL-1\u03b2-induced fever in rats, and this mechanism might be related with the decrease of cAMP synthesis in hypothalamus; meanwhile the expression of HSP70 was reduced.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the effects of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) polymerization on the LPS-induced febrile reaction in rabbits and study its relationship with cAMP content, so as to investigate whether HSF1 plays a role in the fever limiting function and the possible mechanisms. Methods: Seventy rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups: (1) Normal control group(N), injection of ethanol in the lateral venericle; (2) Quercetin group(Q), injection of quercetin and ethanol solution (2.5 \u03bcmol/L); (3)Lipopolysaccharide group(L), LPS(0.5 \u03bcg/kg) was injected 10 min after injection of ethanol; (4) Quercetin plus LPS group(Q+L), LPS was injceted 10 min after injection of quercetin plus ethanol(2.5 \u03bcmol/L). The polymerization of HSF1 was induced by reproducing LPS-induced febrile reaction model in rabbits to assess the influence of polymerized HSF1 on LPS-induced febrile reaction. The content of cAMP in the hypothalamus was measured by radioimmunoassay. The expression of HSF1 and HSP70 protein in the hypothalamus was detected by Western blotting. Results: The difference between basal temperature and temperatures of defined time points \u0394T (240-360 min) of Q+L group was significantly higher than that of L group (P<0. 05); TRI, was 8. 32\u00b10. 63 in Q+L group, significantly higher than that of L group (P<0. 05); and the contents of cAMP of Q + L group at all time points were significantly higher than those of the L group (P< 0. 01). Polymeric HSF1 content started to increase at 60 min after LPS injection and obviously increased when the body temperature reached the peak (180 min, being 1. 77 folds that of the control level); then with the increase of HSF1 trimerization, the body temperature began to decrease. When pretreatment with quercetin was performed to inhibit polymerization of HSF, the levels of HSF1 trimerization at 60 min,180 min,240 min,and 360 min in Q+L group were significantly lower than those in the corresponding L group (all P<0. 05); meanwhile, the expression of HSP70 was decreased, the content of cAMP was increased, the febrile reaction was intensified and the time course of the febrile reaction was extended. Conclusion: Polymeric HSF1 can inhibit the LPS-induced febrile reaction, which is probably related to the down-regulation of AMP content in the hypothalamus.",

        "abstract": "Methylation, a methyl group-consuming reaction, plays a key role in the degradation (i.e., inactivation) of monoamine neurotransmitters, including catecholamines, serotonin and histamine. Without labile methyl groups, the methylation-mediated degradation cannot take place. Although high niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) intake, which is very common nowadays, is known to deplete the body's methyl-group pool, its effect on monoamine-neurotransmitter degradation is not well understood. The aim of this article was to investigate the effect of excess nicotinamide on the levels of plasma serotonin and histamine in healthy subjects. Urine and venous blood samples were collected from nine healthy male volunteers before and after oral loading with 100 mg nicotinamide. Plasma N(1)-methylnicotinamide, urinary N(1)-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-Py), and plasma betaine levels were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma concentrations of choline, serotonin and histamine were measured using commercial kits. The results showed that the plasma N(1)-methylnicotinamide level and the urinary excretion of 2-Py significantly increased after oral loading with 100 mg nicotinamide, which was accompanied with a decrease in the methyl-group donor betaine. Compared with those before nicotinamide load, five-hour postload plasma serotonin and histamine levels significantly increased. These results suggest that excess nicotinamide can disturb monoamine-neurotransmitter metabolism. These findings may be of significance in understanding the etiology of monoamine-related mental diseases, such as schizophrenia and autism (a neurodevelopmental disorder).",

Methods: The relationship among the expression of HSF1 and interleukin 1\u03b2(IL-1\u03b2) mRNA and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) mRNA in nomocytes was studied during the different fever stages in rabbit fever model induced by LPS. The expressions of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA were measured by RT-PCR assay; HSF1 expression was measured by Western blot. Results: \u2460 Intravenous injection of LPS produced a double-peak temperature arisen at 60 min and 180 min. \u2461 The expression of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA in monocytes had a peak at 160 min, while the peak of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression occurred at 80 min after intravenous injection of LPS. \u2462 The content of the HSF1 trimer increased gradually after 160 min intravenous injection of LPS. The results indicated that the content of the HSF1 trimer was negative correlation with the expressions of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA, and the change in body temperature was a positive correlation with IL-1\u03b2 mRNA.

        "abstract": "Object localization in an image is usually handled by searching for an optimal subwindow that tightly covers the object of interest. However, the subwindows considered in previous work are limited to rectangles or other specified, simple shapes. With such specified shapes, no subwindow can cover the object of interest tightly. As a result, the desired subwindow around the object of interest may not be optimal in terms of the localization objective function, and cannot be detected by a subwindow search algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new graph-theoretic approach for object localization by searching for an optimal subwindow without pre-specifying its shape. Instead, we require the resulting subwindow to be well aligned with edge pixels that are detected from the image. This requirement is quantified and integrated into the localization objective function based on the widely-used bag of visual words technique. We show that the ratio-contour graph algorithm can be adapted to find the optimal free-shape subwindow in terms of the new localization objective function. In the experiment, we test the proposed approach on the PASCAL VOC 2006 and VOC 2007 databases for localizing several categories of animals. We find that its performance is better than the previous efficient subwindow search algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Shape matching has many applications in computer vision, such as shape classification, object recognition, object detection, and localization. In 2D cases, shape instances are 2D closed contours and matching two shape contours can usually be formulated as finding a one-to-one dense point correspondence between them. However, in practice, many shape contours are extracted from real images and may contain partial occlusions. This leads to the challenging partial shape matching problem, where we need to identify and match a subset of segments of the two shape contours. In this paper, we propose a new MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) based algorithm to handle partial shape matching with mildly non-rigid deformations. Specifically, we represent each shape contour by a set of ordered landmark points. The selection of a subset of these landmark points into the shape matching is evaluated and updated by a posterior distribution, which is composed of both a matching likelihood and a prior distribution. This prior distribution favors the inclusion of more and consecutive landmark points into the matching. To better describe the matching likelihood, we develop a contour-subdivision technique to highlight the contour segment with highest matching cost from the selected subsequences of the points. In our experiments, we construct 1,600 test shape instances by introducing partial occlusions to the 40 shapes chosen from different categories in MPEG-7 dataset. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing with three well-known partial shape matching methods.",

In this paper, we develop CrackTree, a fully-automatic method to detect cracks from pavement images. In practice, crack detection is a very challenging problem because of (1) low contrast between cracks and the surrounding pavement, (2) intensity inhomogeneity along the cracks, and (3) possible shadows with similar intensity to the cracks. To address these problems, the proposed method consists of three steps. First, we develop a geodesic shadow-removal algorithm to remove the pavement shadows while preserving the cracks. Second, we build a crack probability map using tensor voting, which enhances the connection of the crack fragments with good proximity and curve continuity. Finally, we sample a set of crack seeds from the crack probability map, represent these seeds by a graph model, derive minimum spanning trees from this graph, and conduct recursive tree-edge pruning to identify desirable cracks. We evaluate the proposed method on a collection of 206 real pavement images and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a better performance than several existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Accurate grain segmentation on 3D superalloy images is very important in materials science and engineering. From grain segmentation, we can derive the underlying superalloy grains' micro-structures, based on how many important physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the superalloy samples can be evaluated. Grain segmentation is, however, usually a very challenging problem because: 1) even a small 3D superalloy sample may contain hundreds of grains; 2) carbides and noises may degrade the imaging quality; and 3) the intensity within a grain may not be homogeneous. In addition, the same grain may present different appearances, e.g., different intensities, under different microscope settings. In practice, a 3D superalloy image may contain multichannel information where each channel corresponds to a specific microscope setting. In this paper, we develop a multichannel edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (MCEWCVT) algorithm to effectively and robustly segment the superalloy grains from 3D multichannel superalloy images. MCEWCVT performs segmentation by minimizing an energy function, which encodes both the multichannel voxel-intensity similarity within each cluster in the intensity domain and the smoothness of segmentation boundaries in the 3D image domain. In the experiment, we first quantitatively evaluate the proposed MCEWCVT algorithm on a four-channel Ni-based 3D superalloy data set (IN100) against the manually annotated ground-truth segmentation. We further evaluate the MCEWCVT algorithm on two synthesized four-channel superalloy data sets. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons of 18 existing image segmentation algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MCEWCVT algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Tracking anatomical structures in x-ray sequences has broad applications, such as motion compensation for dynamic 3D/2D model overlay during image guided interventions. Many anatomical structures are curve-like such as ribs and liver dome. To handle various types of anatomical curves, a generic and robust tracking framework is needed to track shapes of different anatomies in noisy x-ray images. In this paper, we present a novel tracking framework, which is based on adaptive measurements of structures' shape, motion, and image intensity patterns. The framework does not need offline training to achieve robust tracking results. The framework also incorporates an online learning method to robustly adapt to anatomical structures of different shape and appearances. Experimental results on real-world clinical sequences confirm that the presented anatomical curve tracking method improves the tracking performance compared to a baseline performance.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing human activities in partially observed videos is a challenging problem and has many practical applications. When the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, the problem is reduced to activity prediction from unfinished activity streaming, which has been studied by many researchers. However, in the general case, an unobserved subsequence may occur at any time by yielding a temporal gap in the video. In this paper, we propose a new method that can recognize human activities from partially observed videos in the general case. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a probabilistic framework: 1) dividing each activity into multiple ordered temporal segments, 2) using spatiotemporal features of the training video samples in each segment as bases and applying sparse coding (SC) to derive the activity likelihood of the test video sample at each segment, and 3) finally combining the likelihood at each segment to achieve a global posterior for the activities. We further extend the proposed method to include more bases that correspond to a mixture of segments with different temporal lengths (MSSC), which can better represent the activities with large intra-class variations. We evaluate the proposed methods (SC and MSSC) on various real videos. We also evaluate the proposed methods on two special cases: 1) activity prediction where the unobserved subsequence is at the end of the video, and 2) human activity recognition on fully observed videos. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art comparison methods.",

        "abstract": "Grain segmentation on 3D superalloy images provides superalloy's micro-structures, based on which many physical and mechanical properties can be evaluated. This is a challenging problem in senses of (1) the number of grains in a superalloy sample could be thousands or even more; (2) the intensity within a grain may not be homogeneous; and (3) superalloy images usually contains carbides and noises. Recently, the Multichannel Edge-Weighted Centroid Voronoi Tessellation (MCEWCVT) algorithm [1] was developed for grain segmentation and showed better performance than many widely used image segmentation algorithms. However, as a general-purpose clustering algorithm, MCEWCVT does not consider possible prior knowledge from material scientists in the process of grain segmentation. In this paper, we address this issue by defining an energy minimization problem which subject to certain constraints. Then we develop a Constrained Multichannel Edge-Weighted Centroid Voronoi Tessellation (CMEWCVT) algorithm to effectively solve this constrained minimization problem. In particular, manually annotated segmentation on a very small set of 2D slices are taken as constraints and incorporated into the whole clustering process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMEWCVT algorithm significantly improve the previous grain-segmentation performance.",

        "abstract": "3D microstructures are important for material scientists to analyze physical properties of materials. While such microstructures are too small to be directly visible to human vision, modern microscopic and serial-sectioning techniques can provide their high-resolution 3D images in the form of a sequence of 2D image slices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the Edge-Weighted Centroid Voronoi Tessellation which uses propagation of the inter-slice consistency constraint. It can segment a 3D superalloy image, slice by slice, to obtain the underlying grain microstructures. With the propagation of the consistency constraint, the proposed method can automatically match grain segments between slices. On each of the 2D image slices, stable structures identified from the previous slice can be well-preserved, with further refinement by clustering the pixels in terms of both intensity and spatial information. We tested the proposed algorithm on a 3D superalloy image consisting of 170 2D slices. Performance is evaluated against manually annotated ground-truth segmentation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art 2D, 3D, and propagation-based segmentation methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and running time.",

For this purpose, it is important to first determine the era in which a painting was drawn. This problem can be very challenging when the paintings from different eras present a same topic and only show subtle difference in terms of the painting styles. In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach to address this problem by using the appearance and shape features extracted from the paintings. In this approach, we first extract the appearance and shape features using the SIFT and kAS descriptors, respectively. We then encode these features with deep learning in an unsupervised way. Finally, we combine all the features in the form of bag-of-visual-words and train a classifier in a supervised fashion. In the experiments, we collect 660 Flying-Apsaras paintings from Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, China and classify them into three different eras, with very promising results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a new superedge grouping method for object localization by incorporating both boundary shape and appearance information of objects. Compared with the previous edge grouping methods, the proposed method does not subdivide detected edges into short edgels before grouping. Such long, unsubdivided superedges not only facilitate the incorporation of object shape information into localization, but also increase the robustness against image noise and reduce computation. We identify and address several important problems in achieving the proposed superedge grouping, including gap filling for connecting superedges, accurate encoding of region-based information into individual edges, and the incorporation of object-shape information into object localization. In this paper, we use the bag of visual words technique to quantify the region-based appearance features of the object of interest. We find that the proposed method, by integrating both boundary and region information, can produce better localization performance than previous subwindow search and edge grouping methods on most of the 20 object categories from the VOC 2007 database. Experiments also show that the proposed method is roughly 50 times faster than the previous edge grouping method.",

        "abstract": "Recent inpainting techniques usually require human interactions which are labor intensive and dependent on the user experiences. In this paper, we introduce an automatic inpainting technique to remove undesired fence-like structures from images. Specifically, the proposed technique works on the RGBD images which have recently become cheaper and easier to obtain using the Microsoft Kinect. The basic idea is to segment and remove the undesired fence-like structures by using both depth and color information, and then adapt an existing inpainting algorithm to fill the holes resulting from the structure removal. We found that it is difficult to achieve a satisfactory segmentation of such structures by only using the depth channel. In this paper, we use the depth information to help identify a set of foreground and background strokes, with which we apply a graph-cut algorithm on the color channels to obtain a more accurate segmentation for inpainting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique by experiments on a set of Kinect images.",

        "abstract": "Motion is one of the most important cues to separate foreground objects from the background in a video. Using a stationary camera, it is usually assumed that the background is static, while the foreground objects are moving most of the time. However, in practice, the foreground objects may show  infrequent motions , such as abandoned objects and sleeping persons. Meanwhile, the background may contain frequent local motions, such as waving trees and/or grass. Such complexities may prevent the existing background subtraction algorithms from correctly identifying the foreground objects. In this paper, we propose a new approach that can detect the foreground objects with frequent and/or infrequent motions. Specifically, we use a visual-attention mechanism to infer a complete background from a subset of frames and then propagate it to the other frames for accurate background subtraction. Furthermore, we develop a feature-matching-based local motion stabilization algorithm to identify frequent local motions in the background for reducing false positives in the detected foreground. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised, without using any supervised learning for object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on a large number of videos have demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art motion detection and background subtraction methods in comparison.",

Specifically, given labeled samples in source domain, we construct subspaces for each of  classes. Then we construct subspaces in  target domain, called anchor subspaces, by collecting unlabeled samples that are close to each other and highly likely all fall into  same class. The corresponding class label is then assigned by minimizing a cost function which reflects  overlap and topological structure consistency between subspaces across source and target domains, and within anchor subspaces, respectively.We further combine  anchor subspaces to corresponding source subspaces to construct  compact joint subspaces. Subsequently, one-vs-rest SVM classifiers are trained in  compact joint subspaces and applied to unlabeled data in  target domain.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To establish a new sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of L-carnitine(LC), Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) and Propionyl-Lcarnitine (PLC) in Human Plasma by HPLC. METHODS The analytes were extracted by protein precipitation and then precolumn derivatization with 1-aminoanthracene (IAA) was performed. The fluorescent derivatives were separated on a Hypersil C18 column, and the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-0. 1 mol \u2022 L-1 ammonium acetate(28: 72), the flow rate was 1. 0 mL \u2022 min-1. The derivatives were monitored with a fluorescent detector set at 248 nm (excitation wavelength) and 418 nm (emission wavelength). RESULTS The good linearity was observed over the concentration ranges of 5 \u223c 160 \u03bcmol \u2022 L-1 for LC, 1 \u223c 32 \u03bcmol \u2022 L-1 for ALC, 0. 25 \u223c 8 \u03bcmol \u2022 L-1 for PLC. The recoveries of LC, ALC and PLC were 99. 48%, 99. 94% and 98. 20%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day validation were adequate with the RSDs of 5. 83% or below. CONCLUSION This method is proved to be stable, accurate and convenient to study the concentrations of LC, ALC and PLC in plasma.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of clinical pharmacists intervening in prophylactic application of antibiotics during perioperative period of inguinal herniorrhaphy. METHODS: 60 discharged medical records were collected from our hospital during Aug.-Dec. in 2009 (before intervention) and Aug.-Dec. in 2010 (after intervention), respectively. The rationality of perioperative prophylactic application of antibiotics was compared in terms of antibiotics indication, medicine selection, usage and dosage, administration time and treatment course, drug combination, handwriting of generic name, etc. RESULTS: After intervention of clinical pharmacists, the perioperative prophylactic application of antibiotics was improved significantly in respects of medicine selection, dosage and usage, drug combination, administration time and treatment course, handwriting of generic name, analysis of antibiotics use in case history. The percentage of total drug cost in total hospitalization costs decreased from 27.66% to 22.62%, and the proportion of total cost of antibiotics in total drug cost decreased from 20.88% to 8.07%. Total hospitalization day of antibiotic use decreased from 2.38 d to 0.95 d. CONCLUSIONS: It is effective and practicable for clinical pharmacists to interven in prophylactic application of antibiotics during perioperative period of inguinal herniorrhaphy. The intervention of clinical pharmacists contributes to the safe, effective, reasonable and economic use of antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the pharmacokinetics of L-carnitine (LC) and its analogues, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) and propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) in healthy volunteers after single L-carnitine administration.Liquid L-carnitine (2.0 g) was administered orally as a single dose in 12 healthy subjects. Plasma and urine concentrations of L-carnitine, ALC and PLC were detected by HPLC.The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC 0-infinity) of L-carnitine was 84.7+/-25.2 micromol x L(-1) x h and 2676.4+/-708.3 micromol x L(-1) x h, respectively. The elimination half-life of L-carnitine and the time required to reach the Cmax (Tmax) was 60.3+/-15.0 and 3.4+/-0.46 h, respectively. The Cmax of ALC (12.9+/-5.5 micromol x L(-1)) and PLC (5.08+/-3.08 micromol x L(-1)) was lower than L-carnitine (P < 0.01), so as the AUC 0-infinity (166.2+/-77.4 and 155.6+/-264.2 micromol x L(-1) x h, respectively, P < 0.01). The half-life of ALC (35.9+/-28.9h) and PLC (25.7+/-30.3 h) was also shorter than L-carnitine (P < 0.01). The 24h accumulated urinary excretion of L-carnitine, ALC and PLC were 613.5+/-161.7, 368.3+/-134.8 and 61.3+/-37.8 micromol, respectively.L-carnitine has a greater maximum plasma concentration than ALC and PLC. L-carnitine also has a longer half-life than ALC and PLC. These data may have important implications in the designing of dosing regimens for L-carnitine or its analogues, such as ALC or PLC.",

METHODS The secretion of lower respiratory tract of 109 patients received tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours was cultured with a quantitative method and their antibiotic susceptibility was detected. RESULTS Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the main pathogens in VAP. Among 294 strains of pathogens collected,the GNB occupied 63.9%,the Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) were 21.8%,and the fungi were 14.3%. The mixed infections attained to 88.1%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to ceftazidime and carbopenems,Mostly Klebsiella and Enterobacter were susceptible to carbopenems. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was drug-resistant to carbopenems and other antibacterial drugs. Staphylococcus aureus was still highly susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS GNB are still the most important pathogens in VAP and have multiple drug-resistance. Mixed infections are severe,bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility tests are very important to select antibiotics correctly for treatment of VAP.",

        "abstract": "l-Carnitine (LC) has protective effects on high glucose-induced oxidative stress in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), haemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS) in the protective effect of LC on RGCs. RGCs were first processed with high concentrations of glucose. LC treatment at three concentrations (50\u03bcM, 100\u03bcM and 200\u03bcM) was applied to high glucose stimulated RGCs. The expression of Nrf2, Keap1, haemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS) was quantified by Western blot in the treatment and control (high glucose stimulation) groups. In the three LC groups (50\u03bcM, 100\u03bcM and 200\u03bcM), Nrf-2 (0.71\u00b10.04, 0.89\u00b10.05, 1.24\u00b10.05 vs 0.56\u00b10.03, p&amp;lt;0.05), HO-1 (0.58\u00b10.04, 0.76\u00b10.06, 0.89\u00b10.07 vs 0.25\u00b10.03, p&amp;lt;0.01), and \u03b3-GCS protein expression (0.66\u00b10.03, 0.79\u00b10.05, 0.84\u00b10.08 vs 0.84\u00b10.08, p&amp;lt;0.01) was higher than in the control group. The levels of Keap1 protein were in the LC groups were lower than in the control group (0.50\u00b10.03, 0.45\u00b10.02, 0.53\u00b10.03 vs 0.86\u00b10.05, p&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, in high glucose stimulated RGCs, LC treatment was associated with an increased level of Nrf2, HO-1and \u03b3-GCS. LC treatment was also associated with a reduced expression of Keap1 protein. These results suggest that the protective effect of LC treatment on RGCs may be related to Nrf2-Keap1 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a role in diabetic retinopathy. L-Carnitine is an endogenous mitochondrial membrane compound.To elucidate the protective effects of L-carnitine on high glucose-induced oxidative stress in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).Hoechst 33258 staining was used to estimate cell loss. Mitochondrial function was predicted by mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) measurement. The expression of apoptosis-related protein was measured by Western blotting. Assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) and antioxidant defense enzymes were completed to explain the antioxidative capacity of L-carnitine.L-Carnitine (12 h) inhibited high glucose-mediated cell loss and restored mitochondrial function including a reversion of \u0394\u03a8m loss and cytochrome c release. Cell apoptosis triggered by high glucose was also inhibited by L-carnitine, characterized by the downregulation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2. Furthermore, L-carnitine inhibited high glucose-induced ROS production and lipid peroxidation and promoted endogenous antioxidant defense components including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and T-AOC in a concentration-dependent manner.L-Carnitine may protect RGCs from high glucose-induced injury through the inhibition of oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and, ultimately, cell apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "L-carnitine has been used as a supplement to treat cardiovascular or liver disease. However, there has been little information about the effect of L-carnitine on anti-oxidation capability in healthy human subjects. This study was designed to investigate the correlation between plasma L-carnitine concentration and antioxidant activity. Liquid L-carnitine (2.0 g) was administered orally as a single dose in 12 healthy subjects. Plasma concentration of L-carnitine was detected by HPLC. The baseline concentration of L-carnitine was 39.14 \u00b1 5.65 \u00b5mol/L. After single oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the curve (AUC(0-\u221e)) were 84.7 \u00b1 25.2 \u00b5mol/L and 2,676.4 \u00b1 708.3 \u00b5mol/L\u00b7h, respectively. The half-life and the time required to reach the C(max) was 60.3 \u00b1 15.0 min and 3.4 \u00b1 0.46 h, respectively. There was a gradual increase in plasma concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase and total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) in the first 3.5 h following L-carnitine administration. The plasma concentrations of SOD, GSH-Px, catalase and T-AOC returned to baseline levels within 24 h. A positive correlation was found between L-carnitine concentration and the antioxidant index of SOD (r = 0.992, P < 0.01), GSH-Px (r = 0.932, P < 0.01), catalase (r = 0.972, P < 0.01) or T-AOC (r = 0.934, P < 0.01). In conclusion, L-carnitine increases activities of antioxidant enzymes and the total antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects. It may be useful as a supplementary therapy for chronic illnesses involving excessive oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of EPO on the apoptosis induced by high levels of glucose in retinal ganglial cells (RGCs). High glucose-induced apoptosis model was established in RGCs isolated from SD rats (1-3 days old) and identified with Thy1.1 mAb and MAP-2 pAb. The apoptosis was determined by Hochest assay. The levels of ROS were quantitated by staining the cells with dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and measure by flow cytometry. The SOD, GSH-Px, CAT activities, and levels of T-AOC and MDA were determined by ELISA. Change in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) was also assessed by flow cytometry, and expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, and cytochrome C were assessed by western blotting. The RGCs treated with high glucose levels exhibited significantly increased apoptotic rate and concentrations of ROS and MDA. Pretreatment of the cells with EPO caused a significant blockade of the high glucose-induced increase in ROS and MDA levels and apoptotic rate. EPO also increased the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT, and recovered the levels of T-AOC levels. As a consequence, the mitochondrial membrane potential was improved and Cyt c release into the cytoplasm was prevented which led to significantly suppressed up-regulation of Bax reducing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The expressions of caspase-3 and caspase-9 induced by high glucose exposure were also ameliorated in the RGCs treated with EPO. The protective effect of EPO against apoptosis was mediated through its antioxidant action. Thus, it blocked the generation of pro-apoptotic proteins and apoptotic degeneration of the RGCs by preventing the mitochondrial damage.",

        "abstract": "In order to explore geographical distribution and morphology of old wild tea plants in Guizhou and clarify their relationship with climatic factors based on canonical and pearson correlation analysis, the eighty-one wild tea plants germplasm resources whose age were more than 100 years old were collected from natural condition in Guizhou. Eighty-one wild tea plants were classified as four species and two varietics of Sect. Thea(L.) Dyer.Nine plants of C. tachangensis were maily distributed in the in the southwestern Guizhou with high temperature and humidity. Nine plants of C. gymnogya were mainly distributed in northwestern Guizhou with similar climatic condition. One plant of C. crassicolumna was located in Malu town in Jinsha County. Three plants of C. assamica were distributed in the border of Guangxi and Guizhou provinces with higher temperature and humidity. Fifty-nine plants of C. sinensis, mainly distributed in the central and western Guizhou, were widely scattered in Guizhou province. By means of canonical correlation analysis, climatic factors had a great impact on geographic distribution of these eighty-one wild tea germplasm. For example, annual precipitation, annual mean air temperature and annual extreme minimum air temperature showed a more significant impact on the geographic distribution of C.gymnogya. C. gymnogya, C. crassicolumna and C. tachangensis species were arbor and large leaf with leather or thin leather. The C. assamica species was semi-arbor and large leaf without leather. The fifty-nine C. sinensis plants with diverse morphology, mainly consisted of middle shaped leaf varieties, and their leaf area was moderately positively correlated with annual extreme maximum air temperature( r=0.28, P<0.05). It was concluded that Guizhou possibly existed original distribution centers of wild tea plants containing C. gymnogya, C.tachangensis and C. sinensis species, and climatic factors influenced their geographic distribution, evolution and partial morphology.",

The residual activities of the wild-type AppA phytase, E31Q and Q307D were 31.42%, 17.46%, and 40.57%, respectively, after being heated at 80\u00b0C for 10 min. The salt bridge subtraction mutant E31Q showed 13.96% thermostability decreasement, and the salt bridge addition mutant Q307D showed 9.15% thermostability enhancement than the wild-type both without the pH and temperature optimum changed. It proved salt bridges play a key role in E. coli AppA phytase's thermostability and the \u03b1/\u03b2-domain of AppA may be sensitive to heat. Salt bridges and the \u03b1/\u03b2-domain of AppA should have high priority to think about to enhance AppA's thermostability for commercial application.

        "abstract": "Despite recent advances in our understanding of the importance of protein surface properties for protein thermostability,there are seldom studies on multi-factors rational design strategy, so a more scientific, simple and effective rational strategy is urgent for protein engineering. Here, we first attempted to use a three-factors rational design strategy combining three common structural features, protein flexibility, protein surface, and salt bridges. Escherichia coli AppA phytase was used as a model enzyme to improve its thermostability. Moreover, the structure and enzyme features of the thermostable mutants designed by our strategy were analyzed roundly. For the single mutants, two (Q206E and Y311K), in five exhibited thermostable property with a higher success rate of prediction (40 %). For the multiple mutants, the themostable sites were combined with another site, I427L, we obtained by directed evolution, Q206E/I427L, Y311K/I427L, and Q206E/Y311K/I427L, all exhibited thermostable property. The Y311K/I427L doubled thermostability (61.7 %, and was compared to 30.97 % after being heated at 80 C for 10 min) and catalytic efficiency (4.46 was compared to 2.37) improved more than the wild-type AppA phytase almost without hampering catalytic activity. These multi-factors of rational design strategy can be applied practically as a thermostabilization strategy instead of the conventional single-factor approach. \u00a9 2013 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.",

In this study, a two-stage process was applied for enhancing TAG/carbohydrate production in the selected microalgae - Neochloris oleoabundans HK-129. In stage I, effects of nitrogen, light intensity and iron on cell growth were investigated, and the highest biomass productivity of 292.83\u00b15.83mg/L/d was achieved. In stage II, different nitrogen-starvation periods, light intensities and iron concentrations were employed to trigger accumulation of TAG and carbohydrate. The culture under 2-day N-starvation, 200\u03bcmol/m(2)/s light intensity and 0.037mM Fe(3+) concentration produced the maximum TAG and carbohydrate productivity of 51.58mg/L/d and 90.70mg/L/d, respectively. Nitrogen starvation period and light intensity had marked effects on TAG/carbohydrate accumulation and fatty acids profile, compared to iron concentration. The microalgal lipid was mainly composed of C16/C18 fatty acids (90.02%), saturated fatty acids (29.82%), and monounsaturated fatty acids (32.67%), which is suitable for biodiesel synthesis.",

In this work, WSPS were extracted from Chinese truffle by RSM combined with single-factor screening, and applied into milk to make a frozen yogurt. Optimum conditions were: temperature 98.96\u2013100 \u00b0C, time 4.94\u20135.37 h, particle size 155.91\u2013164.77 mesh, water to truffle ratio 46.66\u201349.3:1 and pH value at 7.0. These optimum conditions yielded WSPS of 12.89\u201313.03%, which is well matched with the predictive yield. WSPS prepared contained 86.37% carbohydrates, 3.15% proteins, 7.54% moisture and 2.88% ash. WSPS consisted of glucose, mannose, galactose, and lyxopyranose. Based on the experiments of the addition, the presence of WSPS reduced significantly the syneresis, improved the viscosity and titratable acidity and contributed better flavour in the FYP yogurt in comparison to the FYC yogurt, which provided important insight in the potential commercialization of WSPS as a functional component of yogurt.

Chemical modification of starch can have a major impact on the biodegradation rate and final biodegradation percentage. The TPS degraded faster than TPDAS under controlled composting conditions. For the TPDAS, the degradation rate and final biodegradation percentage were closely related to the degree of oxidation of dialdehyde starch (DAS). The possible reason was also discussed. The biodegradation process of TPS and TPDAS exhibited three phases or stages with different degradation speeds. The biodegradation in the first phase was slow, accelerated in the second phase and leveled off in the third phase. Three kinds of actinomycete were isolated from the compost and identified as micromonospora, nocardia and streptomycete, which were degrading microorganisms of the starch tested. The abilities of these strains to decompose the TPS and TPDAS were also discussed.",

They act as a base and an acid, respectively. However, the remaining high repair activity when the pH value is higher than the pKa of histidine suggests the involvement of other basic amino acids in photoreactivation. According to the results of in vivo enzyme assay and three-dimension structural model of Dunaliella salina (6-4) photolyase we hypothesized that Lys(281) might be involved in the photoreactivation over the pH range from 10.0 to 11.0. To test this, we generated two mutant forms of the (6-4) photolyase, K281G and K281R mutant, by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, and performed the enzyme assay with these mutants. From these results we conclude that the Lys(281), which is highly conserved in (6-4) photolyases, participates in the photoreactivation and acts as an acid to donate a proton to His(401) when the environmental pH is higher than the pKa value of histidine.",

Here, we present the analysis of the 2,282 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated together with 3,990 ESTs from dbEST. A total of 4,148 unique sequences (UniSeqs) were identified, of which 56.1% had sequence similarity with Uniprot entries, suggesting that a large number of unique genes may be harbored by Dunaliella. Additionally, protein family domains were identified to further characterize these sequences. Then, we also compared EST sequences with different complete eukaryotic genomes from several animals, plants, and fungi. We observed notable differences between D. salina and other organisms. This EST collection and its annotation provided a significant resource for basic and applied research on D. salina and laid the foundation for a systematic analysis of the transcriptome basis of green algae development and diversification. \u00a9 2011 Phycological Society of America.",

        "abstract": "Dunaliella salina is a unicellular green alga and possesses two types of photolyase: Class II cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) photolyase and (6-4) photolyase. The gene of D. salina (6-4) photolyase is the first one found in unicellular organisms. CPD photolyases have been extensively studied but (6-4) photolyases are less understood. Because of the data observed in this study, D. salina (6-4) photolyase is insensitive to high salinity; whether it can tolerate a higher level of salinity than other (6-4) photolyases needs to be studied further. However, evidence is provided that (6-4) photolyases might be highly conserved among different species, not only in the sequence identity but also in the photorepair mechanism. \u00a9 2008 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

So here we constructed C-lose mutant to prove it. The residual activities of the wild-type AppA phytase and C-lose were 31.42 and 70.49 %, respectively, after being heated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min. The C-terminal deletion mutant C-lose showed 39.07 % thermostability enhancement than the wild-type both without the pH and temperature optimum changed. It proved the C-lose plays a key role in E. coli AppA phytase's thermostability.",

        "abstract": "Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are able to remove the superoxide anion free radicals produced by environmental stress and thereby protect cells from being injured by reactive oxygen species. However, SOD is unable to transduce automatically across cell membranes. Protein transduction domains (PTDs) are peptides able to mediate protein delivery into cells and were first observed in the HIV\u20111 Tat protein. In the present study, PTD (RKKRRQRRR) was fused to Dunaliella salina (Ds)MnSOD to form PTD\u2011DsMnSOD. This was inserted into pET32a to construct the recombinant plasmid pET32a\u2011PTD\u2011DsMnSOD and transduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) to obtain purified PTD\u2011DsMnSOD proteins. Liposome\u2011encapsulated proteins are also able to cross cell membranes. In this study, DsMnSOD proteins were purified and encapsulated by liposomes. The obtained MnSOD, PTD\u2011MnSOD and liposome MnSOD were used to protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from injury under oxygen pressure. A cell counting kit 8 was used to test the survival rate of HUVECs and results indicated that the protective effect of MnSOD was limited compared with that of PTD\u2011MnSOD and liposome MnSOD. Thus, PTD and liposomes exhibited improved effects when MnSOD was present in cells.",

A prokaryotic expression vector pET32a-DsCBF was constructed to study the function of DsCBF in Descurainia sophia. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21, and the fusion protein was further purified through Ni-affinity chromatography. CBF had an AP2 domain which was bound with the element of CRT/DRE specially. The transaction of CBF and promoter of COR were studied through EMSA (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Two probes were synthesized, and one of them had a TATA-box and AT-TA palindrome structure except core sequence CCGAC and the other only had the core sequence CCGAC. Our conclusion indicates that DsCBF bound with CRT/DRE element may be affected by TATA-box and AT-TA palindrome structure. Fig 6, Ref 19.",

Herein, the genomic sequence and four splice variants encoding the complex I 19-kD subunit were isolated from Dunaliella salina. There were four transcripts coding for the complex I 19-kD subunit due to alternative splicing in algae, and the four transcripts were translated to two protein isoforms with varying C-terminals. We report the splicing pattern in the 3'-region of the D. salina 19-kD subunit, in which three of the exons (5, 6, and 7) could be alternatively spliced. Moreover, we found that four alternatively spliced variants were subject to coordinated transcription in response to different stresses by real-time quantitative PCR.",

The recombinant hybrid antimicrobial peptides were successfully expressed and purified in Pichia pastoris. Antimicrobial activity assay showed that both of the two hybrid antimicrobial peptides had strong antibacterial abilities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Salmonella derby. The potency of CAM and CBM to E. coli 25922 were 0.862 and 0.849, respectively, slightly lower than Amp's 0.957. The hemolytic assays indicated CAM and CBM had no hemolytic in vivo and in vitro, and so they had a good application prospect.",

        "abstract": "The unicellular green alga Dunaliella salina (Dunal) Teodor. is a novel model photosynthetic eukaryote for studying photosystems, high salinity acclimation, and carotenoid accumulation. In spite of such significance, there have been limited studies on the Dunaliella genome transcriptome and proteome. To further investigate D. salina, a cDNA library was constructed and sequenced. Here, we present the analysis of the 2,282 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated together with 3,990 ESTs from dbEST. A total of 4,148 unique sequences (UniSeqs) were identified, of which 56.1% had sequence similarity with Uniprot entries, suggesting that a large number of unique genes may be harbored by Dunaliella. Additionally, protein family domains were identified to further characterize these sequences. Then, we also compared EST sequences with different complete eukaryotic genomes from several animals, plants, and fungi. We observed notable differences between D. salina and other organisms. This EST collection and its annotation provided a significant resource for basic and applied research on D. salina and laid the foundation for a systematic analysis of the transcriptome basis of green algae development and diversification.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Most native polygalacturonases are glycosylated. Owing to the influence of attached glycans on the function of proteins, an immobilized non-glycosylated polygalacturonase is fabricated for the degradation of pectin-rich biomass pectin into fermentable sugars. Recombinant non-glycosylated and glycosylated PGAs expressed by  E.\u00a0coli  and  P.\u00a0pastoris , respectively, were prepared. As application model, recombinant polygalacturonases in immobilized enzyme membrane reactors were tested. The electrospun chitosan-based nanofibrous membrane was selected as the support matrix. The maximum enzyme loading efficiency and enzyme binding efficiency of non-glycosylated polygalacturonase and glycosylated polygalacturonase were 89.12\u00a0mg/g and 84.13% and 34.16\u00a0mg/g and 87.18%, respectively, suggesting that the glycosylation of polygalacturonases had a serious effect on its immobilization. The membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the glycosylation can significantly enhance the stability of recombinant polygalacturonases. Meanwhile, the glycosylation influenced their specific activity and degradation pattern. Most interesting of all, some  d -galacturonic acid monomers occurred in the hydrolysate after the degradation of pectin by the non-glycosylated polygalacturonase, and the yield of reducing sugar could be 31.98\u00a0mg after 60min, with a conversion rate of 63.96%. Thus, the constructed reactor has potential in using pectin-rich biomass as the feedstock.",

        "abstract": "A newly isolated oleaginous fungus strain Mucor fragilis AFT7-4 screened from farmland soil was shown to be a prospective producer of microbial lipid. To improve oil production, lipid collection techniques involving cell disruption and oil extraction were investigated, and fermentation conditions were also optimized by response surface methodology with a 3-level 4-factor Box-Behnken Design. The results showed that the method, which is the combination of acid-heating and freeze-thawing worked best for cell disruption, and chloroform/methanol solution (2:1, v/v) was the most suitable extraction system for oils extraction. Under the optimum conditions [glucose concentration 86 g/L, ammonium sulfate concentration 2.5 g/L, inoculum concentration (v/v) 11%, fermentation time 5 days], a lipid yield of 12.86 g/L and the lipid content of 46.80% could be achieved. These represented a 33.63% improvement in the lipid yield and a 44.44% increase in the lipid content compared with the original values (9.04 g/L and 32.41%). This work was firstly studied on a Mucor fragilis strain systematically for oil production. \u00a9 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2016 \u00a9 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 1784\u20131792, 2016",

However, a behavior-level memristor-based neuromorphic computing simulator, which can model the performance and realize an early stage design space exploration, is still missing. In this paper, we propose a simulation platform for the memristor-based neuromorphic system, called MNSIM. A hierarchical structure for memristor-based neuromorphic computing accelerator is proposed to provides flexible interfaces for customization. A detailed reference design is provided for large-scale applications. A behavior-level computing accuracy model is incorporated to evaluate the computing error rate affected by interconnect lines and nonideal device factors. Experimental results show that MNSIM achieves over 7000 times speed-up than SPICE simulation. MNSIM can optimize the design and estimate the tradeoff relationships among different performance metrics for users.",

        "abstract": "In the nano regime it has become increasingly important to consider the impact of non-rectangular gate (NRG) shape caused due to sub-wavelength lithography. NRG dramatically increases the leakage current and requires geometry dependent transistor models for post-litho circuit simulation. In this paper, we propose a coherent modeling approach for non-rectangular gates based on equivalent gate length (Le). A gate-voltage dependent model of Le is developed which is scalable with design conditions, continuous across weak and strong inversion regions, accurate for both leakage and saturation current, and compatible with standard circuit analysis tools. We systematically verify this approach with 65nm TCAD simulations. A generic CAD algorithm is further proposed to predict the value of Le under various non-rectangular geometries. The interaction with the narrow-width effect is efficiently convolved in this method. Depending on the gate geometry, the leakage current can vary more than 15X at 65nm technology node. Our analytical method well captures this effect. Finally, we extrapolate the impact of NRG effect on future technology generations. The proposed model can be easily extracted from TCAD tools or direct silicon data. It bridges the gap between lithography, simulation, and circuit analysis for measuring transistor performance under increasingly severe NRG effect.",

        "abstract": "Pelgrom's model (1) suggests that a spatial correlation structure is inherent in the physical properties of semiconductor devices; specifically, devices situated closely together will be subject to a higher degree of correlation than devices separated by larger distances. Since correlation of device gate length values caused by systematic variations in microlithographic processing is known to carry a significant impact on the variability of circuit performance, we attempt to extract and understand the nature of spatial correlation across an entire die. Based on exhaustive, full-wafer critical dimension measurements collected using electrical linewidth metrology for wafers processed in a standard 130nm lithography cell (8), we calculate a spatial correlation metric of gate length over a full-field range in both horizontal and vertical orientations. Using a rudimentary model fit to these results, we investigate the impact of correlation in the spatial distribution on the variability of circuit performance using a series of Monte Carlo analyses in HSPICE; it is confirmed that this correlation does indeed present a significant influence on performance variability. From the same dataset, we also extract both the across-wafer ( AW) and within-field ( WIF) contributions to systematic variation. We find that the spatial correlation model's shape is strongly related to these two components of variation (both in magnitude as well as by spatial fingerprint). By artificially reducing each of these components of systematic variation\u2014thereby simulating the effects of active, across-field process compensation\u2014we show that spatial correlation is significantly reduced, nearly to zero. This implies that Pelgrom's model may not apply to die-scale separation distances, and that a more accurate correlation theory would combine Pelgrom's model over very short separation distances with a systematic variation model that captures variability over longer distances by means of non- stationary distributions.",

This outcome is the result of (a) increasing sensitivity to various intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources as circuits shrink, and (b) a corresponding increase in parametric variability causing behavior similar to what would be expected with hard (topological) faults. This paper examines the issue of circuit resilience, then proposes and demonstrates a roadmap for evaluating fault rates starting at the 45nm and going down to the 12nm nodes.

We decompose the variations of gate length (L), threshold voltage (Vth) and other three parameters primarily from the leakage and linear current. Both L and Vth variations are normally distributed, with negligible spatial correlation. By including variations in the model file, we can accurately predict drive current in all process corners.

NRG dramatically increases the leakage current by more than 15X compared to that of ideal physical layout. To mitigate such a penalty, we developed a technique to optimize regular layout through restrictive design rule parameters and to benchmark post-lithography circuit performance. We propose a procedure to systematically optimize key layout parameters in regular layout to minimize the leakage energy with minimal over head to active energy, circuit speed and area. The proposed layout optimization technique is demonstrated with a 65nm technology and projected for 45nm and 32nm technology nodes.

        "title": "Standby supply voltage minimization for deep sub-micron SRAM",
        "abstract": "Suppressing the leakage current in memories is critical in low-power design. By reducing the standby supply voltage ( V DD ) to its limit, which is the data retention voltage (DRV), leakage power can be substantially reduced. This paper models the DRV of a standard low leakage SRAM module as a function of process and design parameters, and analyzes the SRAM cell stability when V DD approaches DRV. The DRV model is verified using simulations as well as measurements from a 4 KB SRAM chip in a 0.13 \u03bcm technology. Due to a large on-chip variation, DRV of the 4 KB SRAM module ranges between 60 and 390 mV. Measurements taken at 100 mV above the worst-case DRV show that reducing the SRAM standby V DD to a safe level of 490 mV saves 85% leakage power. Further savings can be achieved by applying DRV-aware SRAM optimization techniques, which are discussed at the end of this paper. Keywords SRAM Leakage suppression DRV Data retention State preservation Variation 1 Introduction Continuous technology scaling over the past four decades has been enabling higher speed and higher integration capacity in VLSI designs. While active power remains constant in the scaling, the chip leakage power increases about five times each technology generation, and becomes one of the main challenges in future CMOS design [1] . In battery-supported applications with low duty-cycles, such as the Pico-Radio wireless sensor nodes [2] , cellular phones, or PDAs, under most situations active power only accounts for a small portion of the system power consumption, and leakage power ultimately determines the battery life. On the other hand, microprocessor designs of today incorporate large memory components, which consume a significant portion of system power budget. For instance, 30% of Alpha 21264 and 60% of StrongARM power are dissipated in cache and memory structures [3] . While activity factor is usually small in memory structures, leakage causes a major part of the memory power consumption. In 70 nm technology it has been projected that 70% of the cache power budget will be the leakage power [4] . As a result of both the technology scaling and large leakage power dissipation in memory structure, memory leakage suppression is critically important for the success of power-efficient designs, especially ultra-low power (ULP) applications. While the leakage of logic modules in a chip can be effectively controlled by gating off these paths at standby mode, the leakage suppression of memories is especially difficult due to the data retention requirement in such structures. The goal of this work is to develop an effective scheme for SRAM leakage suppression in battery-powered applications such as wireless sensor nodes. The analysis and techniques in this paper focus on the needs of such ULP designs, but are also applicable in general. A large variety of techniques have been proposed to reduce the leakage of SRAM cells and corresponding peripheral circuits. Since leakage power of the peripheral circuits during idle period can be eliminated by turning off these leakage paths with switched source impedance (SSI) [5] , this work focuses on the leakage suppression of SRAM cells only. In the proposed approach, the standby supply voltage ( V DD ) of the whole memory is minimized with the memory states preserved. As a result of reduced voltage, all the leakage components in an SRAM cell are effectively minimized. This analysis of ultra low voltage reliable data retention and its results can also be used for the future SRAM design in ULP applications with aggressively scaled operational V DD . At the circuit level, the existing most effective low power design methods in minimizing SRAM cell leakage power are to lower supply voltage and increase transistor threshold voltage ( V th ), both detrimental to the speed of memory read/write operations. For this reason, leakage reduction techniques at this level typically exploit dynamic control of transistor gate-source and substrate-source bias to enhance driving strength in active mode and low leakage paths during standby periods [6] . For example, the driving source-line (DSL) scheme connects source line of the cross-coupled inverters in an SRAM cell to negative voltage V BB during read cycle, and leaves the source line floating during write cycle. As a result, the cell read access time is improved with boosted gate-source voltage and forward bias of the source\u2013substrate junction of the transistors. The write cycle is also improved since the NMOS transistors in the cross-coupled inverter pair are inactive [7] . Another technique is the negative word-line driving (NWD) scheme. It uses low V th access transistors with negative cut-off gate voltage and high V th cross-coupled inverter pair with boosted gate voltage to achieve both improved access time and reduced standby leakage [8] . The dynamic leakage cut-off (DLC) scheme biases the substrate voltages of non-selected SRAM cells at \u223c2 V DD for V NWELL and \u223c \u2212 V DD for V PWELL [9] . A concern in some of these schemes is that the gate voltages of transistors far exceed V DD , which raises reliability issues [9] . All of these techniques achieve enhanced memory operation speed and suppressed standby leakage current at sub-1V supply voltage compared to conventional cell implementation. As discussed at the end of this paper, these schemes can be applied together with the proposed ultra low voltage standby scheme, for an optimal leakage saving. At the architectural level, leakage reduction techniques include gating-off the supply voltage ( V DD ) of idle memory sections, or putting less frequently used sections into drowsy standby mode. To achieve optimal power-performance tradeoffs, compiler-level cache activity analysis are employed to balance the potential for saving leakage energy against the loss incurred in extra cache misses. As an example, the cache decay technique applied adaptive timing policies in cache line gating, achieving 70% leakage saving at performance penalty of less than 1% [10] . To further exploit leakage control in caches with large utilization ratio, the approach of drowsy caches allocates inactive cache lines to a low-power mode, where V DD was lowered while preserving memory data [4] . With a conservatively chosen standby V DD in the drowsy caches approach, leakage energy savings of over 70% in a data cache can be achieved [4] . However the question still remains on the lower bound of standby V DD that still preserves the data, namely DRV. Knowledge of DRV therefore allows a designer to exploit the maximum achievable leakage reduction for a given technology. Furthermore, in the sub-1V low power VLSI designs of today, the reliability requirement on memories has become the bottleneck in further reducing the system V DD . To enable even more aggressive memory supply voltage minimization, understanding of low voltage SRAM data preservation behavior is required to quantitatively evaluate the SRAM data retention reliability under low V DD and optimize the future SRAM designs for ULV operation conditions. This paper explores data retention voltage in SRAM cells under realistic conditions of process and design parameter variations. Section 2 develops analytical model of DRV to investigate the dependence of DRV on process and design parameters. SRAM reliability when the standby V DD approaches DRV is analyzed in the same section. To verify the model and further understand the limitations of DRV under realistic conditions, a 4 KB SRAM test chip with dual-rail supply scheme was designed and fabricated in a 0.13 \u03bcm technology, as introduced in Section 3 . An on-chip switch capacitor (SC) converter is used to generate the standby V DD . Section 4 presents measurement results of the SRAM data preservation and leakage suppression. Using Berkeley Predictive Technology Model, scaling trend of SRAM DRV for future technologies is studied in Section 5 . Sizing optimization for a DRV-aware SRAM cell design is discussed as an approach to further minimize leakage current and improve cell robustness. Section 6 concludes current work and proposes future directions. 2 ULV SRAM data retention analysis The circuit structure of a 6T SRAM cell is shown in Fig. 1 a. As in a typical SRAM design, the bitline voltages are set to V DD during standby mode. To facilitate the DRV analysis, this cell can be represented by a flip\u2013flop comprised of two inverters as shown in Fig. 1 b [11] . The inverters include access transistors M 5 and M 6 . When V DD is reduced to DRV during standby operation, all six transistors in the SRAM cell are in the sub-threshold region. Thus, the capability of SRAM data retention strongly depends on the sub-threshold current conduction behavior. In order to understand the low voltage data preservation behavior of SRAM and the potential for leakage saving through minimizing standby supply voltage, analytical models of SRAM DRV and cell leakage current are developed in this section. 2.1 Analytical DRV modeling As the minimum V DD required for data preservation, DRV of an SRAM cell is a measure of its state-retention capability under very low voltage. In order to stably preserve data in an SRAM cell, the cross-coupled inverters shown in Fig. 1 (b) must have loop gain greater than one. The stability of an SRAM cell is also indicated by the static-noise margin (SNM) [11] . As shown in Fig. 2 , SNM can be graphically represented as the maximum possible square between the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) curves of the internal inverters from Fig. 1 b. When V DD scales down to DRV, the VTC of the internal inverters degrade to such a level that the loop gain reduces to one and SNM of the SRAM cell falls to zero, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Using the notations from Fig. 1 , this condition is given by: (1) \u2202 V 1 \u2202 V 2 | inverter I \u00d7 \u2202 V 2 \u2202 V 1 | inverter I I = 1 , when V DD = D R V . If V DD is reduced below DRV, the inverter loop switches to the other biased state determined by the deteriorated inverter VTC curves, and loses the capability to hold the stored data. Based on Eq. (1) , the DRV of an SRAM cell can be determined by solving the sub-threshold VTC equations of the two internal data-holding inverters, since all the transistors conduct in weak inversion region when V DD is around DRV. The derivation is presented below. When an SRAM cell ( Fig. 1 ) is in standby mode, the currents in each internal inverter are balanced: (2) Node V 1 : I 1 + I 5 = I 2 , (3) Node V 2 : I 3 + I 6 = I 4 . Assuming that the original state stored in SRAM cell is: (4) V 1 \u2248 0 and V 2 \u2248 V DD , and that the bit-lines are connected to V DD during standby, I 6 is negligible and Eq. (3) can be simplified to: (5) Node V 2 : I 3 = I 4 . In Eqs. (2) (3) and (5) , I i is the sub-threshold current of the i th transistor ( Fig. 1 ). Assuming room-temperature standby operation, I i can be considered as dominated by the drain-source leakage in current technology (i.e., ignoring gate leakage and other leakage mechanisms which have minor contribution compared to the sub-threshold current), I i is modeled as in [12] : (6) I i = \u03b2 i I 0 exp ( \u2212 V th , i n i v ) exp ( V gs , i n i v ) ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 V DS , i / v ) , where v = kT / q is the thermal voltage, equal to 26 mV when T =27 \u00b0C; \u03b2 i is the transistor (W/L) ratio, I 0 is the leakage current of a unit sized device at V gs =0 and V ds \u226b v , T is the chip temperature, and n i is the sub-threshold factor, (sub-threshold swing divided by 60 mV at room temperature). If we further define: (7) I off , i = \u03b2 i I 0 exp ( \u2212 V th n i k T / q ) , I i can be expressed as: (8) I i = I off , i exp ( V gs n i k T / q ) ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 V DS / ( k T / q ) ) . Substituting the current models in Eqs. (7) and (8) , which are functions of V 1 , V 2 , V DD , T , and other technology parameters, into Eqs. (2) and (5) , we obtain the VTCs of the inverters in the cell. Then, together with Eq. (1) , the value of the DRV (and the corresponding V 1 and V 2 ) can be derived. A general solution to these equations requires numerical iterations. To avoid the iterations, we first estimate the initial value of DRV, i.e. DRV (0) , using the approximations in Eq. (4) : (9) DRV ( 0 ) = k T / q n 2 \u2212 1 + n 3 \u2212 1 log [ ( n 3 \u2212 1 + n 4 \u2212 1 ) I off , 4 I off , 2 I off , 3 ( I off , 5 n 2 + I off , 1 ( n 1 \u2212 1 + n 2 \u2212 1 ) \u2212 1 ) ] Then, using DRV (0) , the approximations in Eq. (4) are refined as: (10) V 1 = k T q I off , 1 + I off , 5 I off , 2 exp ( \u2212 DRV ( 0 ) n 2 k T / q ) , (11) V 2 = DRV ( 0 ) \u2212 k T q I off , 4 I off , 3 exp ( \u2212 DRV ( 0 ) n 3 k T / q ) . With Eqs. (10) and (11) available, we can refine the calculation of DRV and a final expression is obtained: (12) DRV = DRV ( 0 ) + [ V 1 2 + ( DRV ( 0 ) \u2212 V ) n 2 / 2 2 ] . The above DRV formula only relies on the values of n i , which can be easily extracted from transistor characterizations, either by simulation or measurement. For the industrial technology we studied, n =1.25 for both PMOS and NMOS. 2.2 DRV sensitivity to variations Process variation and temperature fluctuation are the main imperfections that cause degradations in circuit performance. For an SRAM cell, mismatch between two internal inverters has a strong impact on its DRV. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the simulated deteriorated SRAM inverter VTC under 200 mV V DD , for cases both without variation and with 3\u03c3 local variations in L and V th . An exaggerated SNM decrease is a clear result of the worst-case local mismatch among transistors, as indicated by the small opening between VTC curves with variations. To further illustrate the impact of different process variation components on DRV, SPICE simulation data in Fig. 4 plots the change in DRV value versus the magnitude of variations in an SRAM cell. As observed, local mismatches among transistors result in substantial DRV increase. Based on a 0.13 \u03bcm technology model, with 3\u03c3 local V th mismatch DRV can be 70 mV higher than the ideal case with perfect matching. At the same time, the global shifting in both V th and L , which affect both inverters ( Fig. 1 b) in the same direction and does not change the matching, has a much weaker impact on DRV. This is because the local mismatch changes the relative drive-strength of transistors. As indicated in Eq. (9) , such driving-strength mismatch between same type of transistors (such as M 2 and M 4 ) causes a substantial increase in DRV value and results in a reduced SNM, as shown in Fig. 3 . On the other hand, when the driving-strength of all transistors are affected in a uniform way, such as the result of a global shifting in V th or L value, their impacts compensate each other and result in small change of DRV. The chip temperature fluctuation is another global variable that has weak influence on DRV since it affects all the transistors in an SRAM cell almost uniformly. Simulation results in Fig. 5 compare the impact of process and temperature variation on DRV. As observed, the DRV increases about 100 mV in the presence of 3\u03c3 local mismatch in V th and L , while the temperature impact is much smaller. When T changes from 27 to 100 \u00b0C, DRV rises only about 13 mV. In our analytical DRV-modeling Eqs. (9)\u2013(12) are based on the individual leakage current of each SRAM cell transistor, so they capture the dependencies of DRV on process parameters ( I off and n ), sizing \u03b2 i , and chip temperature ( T ). For a first-order analysis, the impact of these variation factors on DRV can be extracted from Eq. (9) as: (13) DRV = DRV matched + \u0394 DRV = DRV matched + \u2211 i a i \u0394 \u03b2 i \u03b2 + \u2211 i b i \u0394 V th i + c \u0394 T where DRV matched is the data-retention voltage of a perfectly matched SRAM cell (i.e. no variations or with only global variation on all transistors) at room temperature; a i , b i , and c are fitting coefficients for each individual transistor. The \u0394\u03b2 and \u0394 V th i terms in this model represent the local variation on individual transistors. \u0394 T is the overall chip temperature fluctuation. Since there is usually a small change in the DRV matched value caused by global variation, this model focuses on capturing the impact of individual, local, transistor variation on DRV. Considering an industrial SRAM cell design in the 0.13 \u03bcm technology used in this study, the model coefficients a i 's are extracted from SPICE simulations as follows: a 1 =10 mV, a 3 =\u221241 mV, a 4 =11 mV ( a 2 is negligible), assuming that the original data stored in the cell is V 1 =0, V 2 = V DD . Temperature coefficient c is extracted as 0.169 mV/\u00b0C, which predicts an increase of 12.3 mV in DRV when T rises from 27 to 100 \u00b0C. The DRV predictions by Eq. (13) match well with SPICE simulations over a wide range of design parameters and their variations. This is illustrated in Table 1 , which summarizes results obtained by SPICE and our analytical model from Eq. (13) . The 3\u03c3 process variation condition used in this table assumes 3\u03c3 worst-case local mismatch in V th and L for all six transistors in the SRAM cell. It should be noted that as a first order analysis, the model in Eq. (13) does not capture the cross-term dependency between parameters of different transistors. For example, the value of PMOS sizing ratio (\u03b2 p ) affects the DRV sensitivity to NMOS size variation ( \u0394\u03b2 n ). For a more accurate analysis, the current model in Eq. (13) should be extended to capture these effects. 2.3 SRAM standby stability analysis To reliably preserve data in an SRAM cell at ULV standby mode, certain noise margin needs to be ensured by assigning an appropriate guard-band in standby V DD above the DRV. This section presents SNM analysis as a guide to understanding this guard band requirement and relationship between SNM, V DD , and DRV. SNM of an SRAM cell can be calculated in many different ways: maximum square between the normal and mirrored VTC, small-signal loop-gain, Jacobian of the Kirchoff equations, coinciding roots. These methods are well researched and it was shown that they are all equivalent [13] . Similar to [11] , we take the loop-gain approach of analyzing the SNM as the maximum value of noise that can be tolerated by the flip\u2013flop before changing states. As shown in Fig. 6 , two noise sources, V n , are inserted to assure the worst-case noise scenario when the noise is present in both gates in the same way [11] . Following the methodology of DRV derivation in Section 2.1 with inserted static noise (14) V GS 2 + V n = V 2 (15) V GS 4 \u2212 V n = V 1 , we obtain a zero-order approximation for SNM from the condition of marginal stability, that is the unity loop-gain. The maximum noise corresponding to the unity gain is given by: (16) SNM = 2 3 V DD \u2212 n k T / q 3 ln ( 2 I off , 4 n I off , 2 I off , 3 ) \u2212 n k T / q 3 ln ( I off , 5 n + 2 I off , 1 n e SNM / ( n k T / q ) ) where we assume ideal case with equal sub-threshold slope factor for NMOS and PMOS transistors, and also make approximations from Eq. (4) . The above formula does not have closed-form solution, but can be solved iteratively. For each V DD , the SNM value after five iterations is shown in Fig. 7 . This zero-order model closely predicts the slope of the SNM- V DD line, compared to simulation data for cases under 3\u03c3 local mismatch and ideal case without variation. Furthermore, from the linear relationship indicated in Fig. 7 we can adopt simple linear macro-model given by: (17) SNM = k ( V dd \u2212 DRV ) , Further expansion of Eq. (16) and comparison with Eq. (17) yields following approximation of the k factor: (18) k \u2248 2 3 + n , where I off,5 from Eq.( 16 ) is neglected due to exponential nature of the other term under the logarithm. This approximation is valid for SNM > nkT/q . With n =1.25, we obtain k =0.47, which exactly matches the simulated data shown in Fig. 7 . The result in Eq. (18) means that smaller sub-threshold factor is desirable for higher noise tolerance in standby mode. This linear correlation of SNM and the standby V DD guard-band voltage facilitates the SRAM design for reliable data retention under low voltage. For example, in order to achieve a 50 mV SNM under 3\u03c3 local process variations, the SRAM standby V DD needs to be 100 mV higher than the corresponding DRV. In the event of radiation particle strikes, other special actions may be needed to combat the soft errors, such as adding additional storage capacitors, or applying error correction schemes. 2.4 SRAM standby leakage modeling The total leakage of an SRAM cell in the subthreshod standby mode can be calculated as: (19) I leak = ( I 1 + I 5 ) + I 4 \u2248 ( I off , 1 + I off , 5 ) + I off , 4 where I off,i is defined in Eq. (7) . After the standby SRAM V DD is determined, the leakage power P leak under designed standby V DD is: (20) P leak = V DD I leak = ( DRV + V gb ) I leak . where V gb stands for the guard-band voltage in standby V DD . Leakage power P leak as provided in Eq. (20) represents the minimum leakage power required for reliable ULV data retention in standard industrial SRAM design. 3 Ultra low voltage SRAM standby: design and implementation To obtain silicon verification of the presented DRV model and explore the potential of SRAM leakage suppression with ultra low standby V DD , a 4 KB SRAM test chip with dual rail standby control was implemented in a 0.13 \u03bcm technology. Designed for ultra low-power applications, this scheme puts the entire SRAM into a deep sleep mode during the system standby period. As shown in Fig. 8 , the SRAM supply rails are connected to the standard V DD and the standby V DD through two big power switches. The test chip consists of a standard 4 KB SRAM module and custom on-chip switch-capacitor (SC) converter that generates the standby V DD with 85% conversion efficiency. The SRAM is an industrial IP module, which was embedded into the chip layout with no change in the original design. The SRAM cell transistor sizes are the same as analyzed in Section 2 . Compared to the existing SRAM leakage control techniques, the simplicity of this scheme leads to minimized design effort and therefore minimum extra power necessary to support control circuitry. 3.1 Dual voltage scheme design considerations When designing for an ultra low standby V DD , reliability of the SRAM data retention at idle mode is the top design concern. Besides process variations, the other factors that may disturb the memory state preservation are mainly noises on the standby supply rail and radiation particles. In this scheme power supply noise is mostly caused by the output voltage ripple of the SC converter. Therefore, an appropriate noise margin needs to be provided in order to achieve the desired reliability. As analyzed in Section 2.3 , assigning a guard band of 100 mV above DRV for standby V DD gives about 50 mV SNM in an SRAM cell. With the 20 mV peak-to-peak ripple on the SC converter output, a guard band of 100 mV provides worst case SNM of 45 mV, which is sufficient for state preservation. In comparison to power supply noise, the radiation particle events pose a more serious hazard. With parasitic capacitance at the data storage node of about 1fF in a 0.13 \u03bcm technology SRAM cell, the critical charge ( Q critical ) for a 1 V V DD is simulated to be approximately 3 fC. This is the minimum amount of charge injection on the storage node needed to disrupt the state preserved in this cell. For a reduced V DD at 100 mV above the DRV, Q critical is reduced to 0.5 fC. Considering the danger of data loss (i.e. soft error), a larger guard-band is needed. Other options to ensure reliable state preservation include additional storage capacitance [14] or implemenation of error-correction schemes. For a dual supply scheme, other design considerations include the operation delay overhead due to the power switch resistance, memory wake up delay and the power penalty during mode transition. Targeted for ultra low-power applications, the system requirements of this design are much more stringent on power than performance [2] . In this context the concern of the operation delay overhead is not crucial. A 200 \u03bcm wide PMOS power switch with 30 \u03a9 conducting resistance is used to connect the memory module to a 1 V active-mode supply voltage. With the same switch the memory wake up time is simulated to be within 10 ns, which is typically a small fraction of the system cycle time in battery-operated applications [15] . The wake up power penalty incurred during switching from the standby mode to the full- V DD mode determines the minimum standby time for the scheme if net power saving over one standby period is to be acheieved. This break-even time is an important system-design parameter, as it helps the power control algorithm to decide when a power-down would be beneficial. With the parasitic capacitance information attained from process model, the minimum standby time in this design is estimated to be several tens of microseconds, which is much shorter than the typical system idle time in a battery-supported system. 3.2 Test chip implementation Layout of the 0.13 \u03bcm SRAM test chip is shown in Fig. 9 . The two main components are a 4 KB SRAM module and a SC converter. This memory is an IP module with no modifications from its original design. As shown in Fig. 10 , a representative five-stage step down dc-dc SC converter topology is selected to implement the on-chip standby V DD generator [16] . Compared to magnetic-based voltage regulators, SC converter provides higher efficiency, smaller output current ripple, and easier on-chip integration for small loads in the microwatt range. The design challenge here resides in handling small output load in the range of 10\u223c20 \u03bcW. With such low power operation, power loss incurred by short-circuit currents during phase switching becomes comparable to output power and forms a significant portion of the total power loss. To maximize power efficiency, it is desirable to minimize both the switching voltage drop and short-circuit current, which have opposite dependence on device sizes. Hence the switch devices need to be carefully designed to balance these two requirements. For example, the NMOS/PMOS switch-type selection should maximize the device gate-source overdrive voltage at conducting mode, and minimize this voltage when the switch is turned off. With these considerations in mind, Fig. 10 shows the optimized design, in which an 85% conversion efficiency is achieved with a 1 V input and an output load equal to the estimated 4 KB SRAM module leakage at standby mode. 4 Measurement results 4.1 DRV measurement The DRV is measured by monitoring the data retention capability of an SRAM cell with different values of standby V DD , as demonstrated in Fig. 11 . With V DD switching between active and standby modes, a specific state is written into the SRAM cell under test at the end of each active period ( t 2 ), and then read out at the beginning of the next active period ( t 1 ). Preservation of the assigned logic state is observed when standby V DD is higher than DRV (top traces), while the state is lost when standby V DD is below DRV (bottom traces), Fig. 11 . Using automatic measurement with a logic analyzer, the DRV of all 32 K SRAM cells on one test chip was measured. Fig. 12 shows the distribution of the 32 K measurement results. The DRV values range from 60 to 390 mV with the mean value around 122 mV. Such a wide range of DRV uncertainty reflects the existence of considerable process variations during fabrication. Due to global variations, the lower end of measured DRV is slightly lower than the 78 mV ideal DRV, assuming perfect process matching. As a result of large process variation, the long DRV tail at the higher end reduces the leakage reduction achievable by minimizing the SRAM standby V DD . To improve the gains in leakage power, more advanced techniques, such as error tolerant schemes, are required to cope with this situation. Temperature dependency of DRV was investigated experimentally. When the test chip was heated up to 100 \u00b0C, a 10 mV increase in DRV is observed. This result matches with the simulated temperature effect on DRV in Fig. 5 . As evaluated in Section 2 , the analytical DRV model proposed in this work not only predicts the ideal DRV values, but also fully captures the impact of process and temperature variations. Thus, it can serve as a convenient base for further design optimizations. Furthermore, Fig. 13 shows the first presented spatial distribution plot of DRV on the measured SRAM chip. From the plot, it can be observed that the on-chip DRV distribution is the combination of random within-die mismatches and systematic deviations on the boundaries of SRAM sub-array blocks. The pattern of SRAM DRV spatial distribution can be exploited in the future work of designing effective error tolerant scheme for even more aggressive SRAM voltage scaling. 4.2 SRAM leakage measurement Leakage measurement result of the 4 KB SRAM is shown in Fig. 14 . The leakage current increases substantially when V DD is high. This phenomenon reflects the impact of process variations on SRAM leakage, more specifically the fluctuations in channel length and V th . For short channel transistors, drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) effect causes V th degradation, resulting in even higher leakage in high- V DD conditions. The shaded area in Fig. 13 indicates the range of measured DRV (60\u2013390 mV). Although the memory states can be preserved at sub-400 mV V DD , adding an extra guard band of 100 mV to the standby V DD enhances the noise robustness of state preservation as discussed in Section 3.1 . With the resulting 490 mV standby V DD , SRAM leakage current can still be reduced by over 70%. Subsequently the leakage power, as the product of V DD and leakage current, is reduced by about 85% compared to 1V operation. 4.3 Dual rail standby scheme measurement The dual rail scheme is shown to be fully functional through the DRV measurements. With 10 MHz switch control signal, the SC converter generates the standby V DD with less than 20 mV peak-to-peak ripple. Wake up time of 10 ns is observed during mode transition, while the sleep time spans around 10 \u03bcs. The delay overhead in SRAM read operation is measured to be about 2\u00d7, which is reasonable for an ultra low-power application where the system clock period is typically 10 times the operation cycle of a low leakage SRAM. 5 DRV-aware SRAM design optimization While SRAM designs have been well optimized for speed and power metrics, improving DRV for future ultra low-voltage applications poses a new challenge for low-power SRAM designers. This section presents a view of the future DRV scaling with technology, and discusses the effective methods to design for the next generation ultra low-voltage and ultra low-power SRAM. 5.1 Trend of DRV scaling Exploring the SRAM ULV data preservation is mainly for the interest of ULP designs today, but the technology scaling will soon bring up this topic to memory designers for all-purpose applications. Based on the Berkeley Predictive Technology Model (BPTM) [17] , simulation results of DRV scaling are shown in Fig. 15 . In this simulation an optimistic estimation of variations is used\u2212\u03c3 of device length variation is fixed at 10% of the mean value and \u03c3 of V th variation fixed at 10 mV. The resulting SRAM DRV scales against the trend of V DD reduction and approaches V DD at sub-45 nm nodes. The up-scaling trend of DRV is a result of both an increasing leakage current (which leads to degradation of I on / I off ) and a larger sensitivity of I off to process variations at smaller technology dimensions. As a result of such DRV and V DD scaling, severe reliability hazard of SRAM data preservation under the normal operation voltage is posed around 45 nm technology node. In order to meet the V DD scaling of bulk CMOS technology and low power design requirements, the degradation of DRV must be efficiently coped with. Measurement and simulation results in previous sections have shown that process variation is the major factor in determining the DRV value of an SRAM cell. Suppressing the process variation is therefore the most effective method to reduce SRAM DRV. As process variation control becomes more difficult in future technology nodes, it will become the limiting factor on SRAM V DD scaling. Temperature variation is shown to be only secondary effect on DRV. It will not be considerable concern in the future either since most ULP applications operate at room temperature. In SRAM design, effective techniques can help reduce the DRV value at minimum overheads of other metrics, such as area, hardware cost and performance. Following section is focused on SRAM sizing optimization as one of the solutions to DRV reduction. Several other approaches are also discussed as the future work of this study. 5.2 DRV-aware SRAM sizing optimization DRV analytical model in Eq. (13) suggests that transistor sizing is an important factor that determines the DRV of an SRAM cell. While sizing has long been an effective technique in conventional power and speed optimization, taking DRV into account is important for future ULP SRAM design. In conventional performance-optimized SRAM cell, the pull-down NMOS devices are sized about 2\u00d7 larger than the PMOS devices. These NMOS transistors are also typically designed with a smaller L to minimize the cell area. Although providing good stability at high- V DD , this imbalance in the pull-up and pull-down leakage paths leads to exacerbated VTC deterioration at low V DD , and degrades DRV. The minimum L of NMOS transistors is also highly sensitive to process variations, which lead to an increase of DRV. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate impact of each of the sizing variables on DRV. Fig. 16 shows simulated DRV over the sizing variables \u03b2 i and L i for different transistors. For each curve all the other sizing variables are fixed at their nominal values from an industrial SRAM cell design. These simulations assume 3\u03c3 local process variations in SRAM transistor channel length and V th . X-axis of the plot is the sizing ratio that each variable ( \u03b2 , L ) is scaled by. Parameter \u03b2 i represents ( W/L ) ratio of the transistor: the pull-up PMOS ( \u03b2 p ), pull-down NMOS ( \u03b2 n ), and access transistors ( \u03b2 a ). The range of sizing ratios in Fig. 16 is constrained with \u03b2 i >1 and L i > L min . From the plot in Fig. 16 it can be observed that DRV can be reduced only by increasing \u03b2 p or L n , with impact of L n being much stronger. This strong DRV dependence on L n is the result of its small nominal value (chosen for minimum cell area), which is sensitive to the process variations. L p has a much smaller impact on DRV due to its larger nominal value. Sizing of access transistors has very small impact on DRV. SPICE simulation shows that for these two transistors, when any one or both of their \u03b2 sizing ratio and L change within 3\u00d7 range, the resulting DRV change is less than 5 mV. This is because none of these two access transistors can significantly affect conducting path formed by the strong pull-down NMOS transistor and the weak pull-up PMOS device. Taking the SRAM cell configuration in Fig. 1 as an example, when V 1 \u22480 and V 2 \u2248 V DD , the inverter formed by conducting PMOS M 3 and leaky NMOS M 4 is the vulnerable path where the state toggling is initiated. Due to the same voltage level at both drain and source, the access transistor M 6 does not leak even though it is connected to the unstable path. Meanwhile the sub-threshold leakage of the other access transistor M 5 is limited by its negative gate-to-source voltage ( V 1 becomes a small positive value when V DD approaches DRV). Also because the M 5 leakage combats with the strong NMOS device M 2 , which is conducting at sub-threshold region, the data preservation path formed by transistors M 1 , M 2 , and M 5 is actually very stable as compared to the other path. The weak dependency of DRV on access transistor sizing can be clearly observed from Fig. 16 . In summary, following are the guidelines for DRV-aware ULV SRAM cell optimization, for applications in which the read/write performance is not a major concern: (1) Increasing L n SRAM cell reduces DRV most effectively, followed by increasing \u03b2 p . (2) Reducing \u03b2 n and L p both improve DRV, but the improvement space is very limited. (3) The sizing of access transistors has negligible effect on DRV. As an example of power and area tradeoff, Fig. 17 a plots the leakage power and SRAM cell area when tuning L n and \u03b2 p for the minimized DRV. In this analysis the SRAM cell transistor area is simply modeled as the sum of transistor gate areas. A 30% increase in SRAM cell transistor area brings about 30 mV reduction in DRV and almost 70% additional leakage power saving. In Fig. 17 b, L n first exploits the increase of area budget due to its effectiveness in reducing DRV. Effectiveness of increasing L n is utilized until L n is about 25% larger than the nominal value, where its impact on DRV drops and from this point on \u03b2 p can be used to further reduce DRV under given area constraint. Although increase of \u03b2 p continuously reduces DRV, no more savings in leakage power is attained due to the positive correlation between PMOS leakage and its sizing ratio \u03b2 p . 6 Conclusions and future work This paper explores the limit of SRAM data preservation under ultra-low standby V DD . An analytical model of the SRAM DRV is developed and verified with measurement results. A commercial SRAM module with high- V th process is shown to be capable of sub-400 mV standby data preservation. With additional 100 mV guard band to account for power supply ripple and cosmic particles, leakage power saving of more than 85% can be achieved with an SRAM module under 490 mV standby V DD , compared to 1 V active mode. The DRV is observed to be a strong function of process variation and also SRAM cell sizing. With proper sizing optimization an additional 70% leakage power saving can be achieved with only 30% SRAM cell transistor area increase. Besides sizing, more variables are being investigated for their impacts on ULP SRAM cell design. Such variables include the transistor V th and body bias voltages. With the control of body bias voltages, the SRAM DRV and leakage current can be dynamically adjusted in different operation modes. Current efforts of this work are on evaluating these effects and attaining the silicon verification. Besides circuit level techniques, more opportunities exist on architectural level innovations. For example, more SRAM leakage savings can be achieved with assistance from error tolerant schemes when the standby supply voltage is scaled down below DRV. In the future work such architecture-level techniques will be investigated with the goal of achieving even lower power and higher reliability in memory design.

By understanding the physical principles of atomistic simulations, we: 1) identify the appropriate method to divide a nonuniform gate into slices in order to map those fluctuations into the device model; 2) extract the variation of Vth from the strong-inversion region instead of the leakage current, benefiting from the linearity of the saturation current with respect to Vth ; 3) propose a compact model of Vth variation that is scalable with gate size and the amount of dopant and gate length fluctuations; and 4) investigate the interaction with non-rectangular gate (NRG) and reverse narrow width effect (RNWE). The proposed SPICE simulation method is validated with atomistic simulation results. Given the post-lithography gate geometry, this approach correctly models the variation of device output current in all operating regions. Based on the new results, we further project the amount of Vth variation at advanced technology nodes, helping shed light on the challenges of future robust circuit design.",

        "abstract": "Operating CMOS circuits with power supplies below the threshold voltage has been suggested for ultra-low power systems. High fan-in or fan-out circuits, such as those in memories, are prone to failure when operating in this regime. Vanishing noise margins due to reduced transistor on-to-off current ratios result in circuit failure as the supply voltage shrinks. Therefore, design guidelines for robust subthreshold logic circuit are developed in this paper. First, an analytical model is derived to determine a circuit\u9a74s fan-in/out limitations and the minimum supply voltage for robust subthreshold operation. Excellent agreement between the analytical model and circuit simulations is shown. This model is applied to the analysis of circuit robustness as affected by design choices, both systematic and random processing variations, supply voltage fluctuations, and temperature variations.",

These equations are targeted for use in: 1) the efficient generation of DCCs and 2) accurate experimental determination of subnanosecond coupling noise. In particular, we explore the concept of using analytical models to efficiently generate DCCs that can then be used to characterize the impact of noise on any victim/aggressor configuration. The concept is model independent, although we investigate several common noise modeling choices and perform a sensitivity analysis to optimize the generation of DCCs. By extending existing noise models, arbitrary configurations can be considered including multiple aggressors in the timing-analysis framework. Simulation using the analytical approach closely matches time-consuming SPICE simulations, making noise-aware timing analysis using DCCs both efficient and accurate. A test chip using a 0.25-\u03bcm CMOS process was designed and its measurement results also show good agreement with SPICE simulations.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor devices with self-feedback mechanisms are considered as a promising alternative to traditional CMOS, in order to achieve faster operation and lower switching energy. Examples include IMOS and FBFET that are operated in a non-equilibrium condition to rapidly generate mobile carriers. More recently, Fe-FET was proposed to improve the switching by integrating a ferroelectric material as gate insulator in a MOSFET structure. Under particular circumstance, ferroelectric capacitance is effectively negative, due to the negative slope of its polarization-electrical field (P-E) curve. This property makes the ferroelectric layer a voltage amplifier to boost surface potential, achieving fast transition. In this paper, a new threshold voltage model is developed to capture the feedback of negative capacitance and IV characteristics of Fe-FET. It is further revealed that the impact of random dopant fluctuation (RDF) on leakage variability can be significantly suppressed in Fe-FET, by tuning the thickness of the ferroelectric layer.",

        "abstract": "Neuromorphic engineering (NE) encompasses a diverse range of approaches to information processing that are inspired by neurobiological systems, and this feature distinguishes neuromorphic systems from conventional computing systems. The brain has evolved over billions of years to solve difficult engineering problems by using efficient, parallel, low-power computation. The goal of NE is to design systems capable of brain-like computation. Numerous large-scale neuromorphic projects have emerged recently. This interdisciplinary field was listed among the top 10 technology breakthroughs of 2014 by the MIT Technology Review and among the top 10 emerging technologies of 2015 by the World Economic Forum. NE has two-way goals: one, a scientific goal to understand the computational properties of biological neural systems by using models implemented in integrated circuits (ICs); second, an engineering goal to exploit the known properties of biological systems to design and implement efficient devices for engineering applications. Building hardware neural emulators can be extremely useful for simulating large-scale neural models to explain how intelligent behavior arises in the brain. The principle advantages of neuromorphic emulators are that they are highly energy efficient, parallel and distributed, and require a small silicon area. Thus, compared to conventional CPUs, these neuromorphic emulators are beneficial in many engineering applications such as for the porting of deep learning algorithms for various recognition tasks. In this review article, we describe some of the most significant neuromorphic spiking emulators, compare the different architectures and approaches used by them, illustrate their advantages and drawbacks, and highlight the capabilities that each can deliver to neural modelers. This article focuses on the discussion of large-scale emulators and is a continuation of a previous review of various neural and synapse circuits.",

Such a capability further helps reduce the load in statistical reliability test. Based on compact models of transistor degradation and circuit performance, we develop analytical solutions that efficiently predict the statistics of both circuit timing and the leakage under temporal stress and process variations. These solutions prove that circuit aging and its variance can be fully predicted from the characteristics of transistor degradation and circuit performance sensitivity to aged parameters, independent on the type and the amount of process variations. Specific results include: (1) under variations, the standard deviation of circuit speed declines with the stress time, following a power law of 1/6; and (2) the logarithmic mean and the standard deviation of leakage current decrease with the stress time as t1/6. The results are systematically validated by simulation and measurement data from an industrial 65 nm technology, enhancing the predictability and efficiency of statistical reliability analysis.",

More specifically, process improvement is most effective when the dishing radius is less than 50 m. During design, dishing effects can be suppressed by uniformly splitting a wide line into several narrower lines; the most beneficial number of line-splitting is between two and four from both efficiency and performance considerations.

        "abstract": "As technology scales, the aging effect caused by negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has become a major reliability concern. In the mean time, reducing leakage power remains to be one of the key design goals. Because both NBTI-induced circuit degradation and standby leakage power have a strong dependency on the input vectors, input vector control (IVC) technique could be adopted to reduce the leakage power and mitigate NBTI-induced degradation. The IVC technique, however, is ineffective for larger circuits. Consequently, in this paper, we propose two gate replacement algorithms [direct gate replacement (DGR) algorithm and divide and conquer-based gate replacement (DCBGR) algorithm], together with optimal input vector selection, to simultaneously reduce the leakage power and mitigate NBTI-induced degradation. Our experimental results on 23 benchmark circuits reveal the following. 1) Both DGR and DCBGR algorithms outperform pure IVC technique by 15%-30% with 5% delay relaxation for three different design goals: leakage power reduction only, NBTI mitigation only, and leakage/NBTI cooptimization. 2) The DCBGR algorithm leads to better optimization results and save on average more than 10 runtime compared to the DGR algorithm. 3) The area overhead for leakage reduction is much more than that for NBTI mitigation.",

In doing so, we develop a new system-performance simulation model as a set of studies within the MARCO GSRC Technology Extrapolation (GTX) system. We model a typical point-to-point global interconnect and focus on accurate assessment of both circuit and design technology with respect to such issues as inductance, signal line shielding, dynamic delay, buffer placement uncertainty and repeater staggering. We demonstrate, for example, that optimal wire sizing models need to consider inductive effects -- and that use of more accurate {-1,3} worst-case capacitive coupling noise switch factors substantially increases peak noise estimates compared to traditional {0,2} bounds. We also find that optimal repeater sizes are significantly smaller than conventional models would suggest, especially when considering energy-delay issues.",

This paper describes initial experiences with development and use of GTX, the MARCO GSRC Technology Extrapolation system. GTX provides a robust, portable framework for interactive specification and comparison of modeling choices, e.g., for predicting system cycle time, die size and power dissipation. We use GTX to reveal surprising levels of uncertainty (modeling and parameter sensitivity) in widely-cited cycle-time models that drive recent roadmaps. We also describe new SOI and bulk device models that have been developed for GTX, as well as studies of power dissipation and delay uncertainty under various implementation assumptions for global interconnects.",

Based on the physical understanding of ballistic transport in the CNFET channel and tunneling at the Schottky barrier contacts, we develop a set of closed-form expressions that predict the device behavior with varying process and bias conditions. Using this model, we compare a CNFET with 22nm MOSFET in both digi-tal and analog domains. We conclude that (1) a CNFET digital circuit can be more than 10X faster than 22nm CMOS; (2) there is 10X improvement in gm for compara-ble device dimensions, and (3) 25X improvement in gDS for comparable saturation current. This simple, scalable model is an efficient tool for analytical treatment of CNFET based circuits, revealing potential design oppor-tunities, especially in the analog domain.",

In recent years, the emerging metal oxide resistive switching random access memory (RRAM) device and RRAM crossbar array have demonstrated a promising hardware realization of the analog matrix-vector multiplication with ultra-high energy efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the impact of nonlinear voltage-current relationship of RRAM devices and the interconnect resistance as well as other crossbar array parameters on the circuit performance and present a design guide. On top of that, we propose a technological exploration flow for device parameter configuration to overcome the impact of nonideal factors and achieve a better trade-off among performance, energy and reliability for each specific application. The simulation results of a support vector machine (SVM) and MNIST pattern recognition dataset show that the RRAM crossbar array-based SVM is robust to the input signal fluctuation but sensitive to the tunneling gap deviation. A further resistance resolution test presents that a 4-bit RRAM device is able to realize a recognition accuracy of ~ 90%, indicating the physical feasibility of RRAM crossbar array-based SVM. In addition, the proposed technological exploration flow is able to achieve 10.98% improvement of recognition accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 26.4% energy savings compared with previous work.",

In particular, the nonrectangular gate (NRG) geometries are caused by subwavelength lithography and have relatively low spatial frequency. In this paper,we present an analytical approach to modelNRGeffects on I-V characteristics.To predict the change of I-V characteristicsdueto theNRG effect, the proposed model converts the postlithography gate profile into an equivalent gate length (Le), which is a function of the gate bias voltage but independent of the drain bias voltage.We demonstrate the accuracy of this approach by comparing it toTCADsimulation results for65-nmtechnology. The new Le model is readily integrated into standard transistor models in traditional circuit simulation tools, such as SPICE, for both dc and transient analyses. We further develop a generic procedure to systematically extract the Le value fromthe postlithographygateprofile.The interaction with the narrow-width effect is also efficiently incorporated into the proposed algorithm. TCAD verification demonstrates that the proposed Le model is simple for implementation, scalable with both transistor geometriesandbias conditions, and also continuous across all the operation regions.",

        "abstract": "Timing uncertainty caused by inductive and capacitive coupling is one of the major bottlenecks in timing analysis. In this paper, we propose an effective loop RLC modeling technique to efficiently decouple lines with both inductive and capacitive coupling. We generalize the RLC decoupling problem based on the theory of distributed RLC lines and a switch-factor, which is the voltage ratio between two nets. This switch-factor is also known as the Miller factor, and is widely used to model capacitive coupling. The proposed modeling technique can be directly applied to partial RLC netlists extracted using existing parasitic extraction tools without advance knowledge of the return path. The new model captures the impact of neighboring switching activity as it significantly affects the current return path. As demonstrated in our experiments, the new model accurately predicts both upper and lower delay bounds as a function of neighboring switching patterns. Therefore, this approach can be easily implemented into existing timing analysis flows such as max-timing and min-timing analysis. Finally, we apply the new modeling approach to a range of activities across the design process including timing optimization, static timing analysis, high frequency clock design, and data-bus wire planning.",

        "abstract": "The aggressive scaling of CMOS technology has inevitably led to vastly increased power dissipation, process variability and reliability degradation, posing tremendous challenges to robust circuit design. To continue the success of integrated circuits, advanced design research must start in parallel with or even ahead of technology development. This new paradigm requires the Predictive Technology Model (PTM) for future technology generations, including nanoscale CMOS and post-silicon devices. This paper presents a comprehensive set of predictive modeling developments. Starting from the PTM of traditional CMOS devices, it extends to CMOS alternatives at the end of the silicon roadmap, such as strained Si, high-k/metal gate, and FinFET devices. The impact of process variation and the aging effect is further captured by modeling the device parameters under the influence. Beyond the silicon roadmap, the PTM outreaches to revolutionary devices, especially carbon-based transistor and interconnect, in order to support explorative design research. Overall, these predictive device models enable early stage design exploration with increasing technology diversity, helping shed light on the opportunities and challenges in the nanoelectronics era.",

Based on physical derivation and circuit theory, closed-form formulas are generated to calculate the RLC circuit elements directly from the inductor layout. The 2-\u03a0 model accurately captures R(f) and L(f) characteristics beyond the self-resonant frequency. Using frequency-independent RLC elements, this new model is fully compatible with both ac and transient analysis. Verification with measurement data from a SiGe process demonstrates accurate performance prediction and excellent scalability for a wide range of inductor configurations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach of transistor modeling is developed for fast statistical circuit simulation in the presence of variations. For both the I-V and C-V characteristics of a transistor, finite data points are identified based on their physical meanings and their importance in circuit operation. The impact of process and design variations is embedded into these key points using analytical expressions. During the simulation, the entire I-V and C-V curves are interpolated from these points with simple polynomial formulas. This novel approach significantly enhances the simulation speed with sufficient accuracy. The model is implemented in Verilog-A to support generic circuit simulators. The accuracy and convergence of the proposed model are comprehensively evaluated through a set of benchmark circuits, including NAND, a pass-gate, latches, AOI, ring oscillators, and an adder. Compared to SPICE simulations with the BSIM models, the simulation time can be reduced by 7 \u00d7 in transient analysis and more than 9 \u00d7 in Monte-Carlo simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper1 proposes a novel methodology for improving the leakage yield of digital circuits in the presence of process variations and under probabilistic timing constraints. The leakage minimization problem is formulated as a discrete optimization problem, where a suitable configuration for each gate in the circuit is selected from a standard-cell library consisting of different implementations of each type of gate. A function of mean and variance of the circuit leakage is minimized with constraint on \u00e1-percentile of the delay using physical delay models. Since the leakage is a strong function of the threshold voltage and gate length, considering them as design variables in addition to gate sizes can provide significant power savings. We propose efficient techniques for computing delay and leakage power gradients which form the basis of the optimization algorithm. Results on various trade-offs such as between leakage and delay, and mean and variance of the leakage are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The design and development of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) is becoming increasingly expensive, complex, and lengthy. Rapid prototyping and emulation of analog ICs will be significant in the design and testing of complex analog systems. A new approach, Programmable ANalog Device Array (PANDA) that maps any AMS design problem to a transistor-level programmable hardware, is proposed. This approach enables fast system level validation and a reduction in post-silicon bugs, minimizing design risk and cost. The unique features of the approach include: 1) transistor-level programmability that emulates each transistor behavior in an analog design, achieving very fine granularity of reconfiguration; 2) programmable switches that are treated as a design component during analog transistor emulating, and optimized with the reconfiguration matrix; and 3) compensation of ac performance degradation through boosting the bias current. Based on these principles, a digitally controlled PANDA platform is designed at 45 nm node that can map AMS modules across 22\u201390 nm technology nodes. A systematic emulation approach to map any analog transistor to 45 nm PANDA cell is proposed, which achieves transistor level matching accuracy of less than 5% for and less than 10% for and . Circuit level analog metrics of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) emulated by PANDA, match to those of the original designs in 22 and 90 nm nodes with less than a 5% error. Several other 90 and 22 nm analog blocks are successfully emulated by the 45 nm PANDA platform, including a folded-cascode operational amplifier and a sample-and-hold module (S/H).",

        "abstract": "Statistical circuit analysis and optimization are critical for robust nanoscale CMOS design. To accurately perform such analysis, primary process variation sources need to be identified and modeled for further circuit simulation. In this work, a rigorous method to extract process variations from in situ IV measurements is present. Transistor statistics are collected from a test chip fabricated in a 65-nm process. Gate length (L ), threshold voltage (Vth) and mobility (\u00c2\u00bf) are recognized as the leading variation sources, due to the tremendous process challenges in lithography, channel doping, and the stress engineering. To decompose these variations, three critical IV points from the cut-off and linear regions are identified. The extracted L , Vth and \u00c2\u00bf variations are normally distributed, with negligible spatial correlation. By including extracted variations in the nominal model file, accurate prediction of the change of drive current in all operation regions and process corners is achieved. The new extraction method guarantees excellent model matching with hardware for further statistical circuit analysis.",

        "abstract": "/sup A/ new approach to handle inductance effects for multiple signal lines is presented. The worst-case switching pattern is first identified. Then a numerical approach is used to model the effective loop inductance (L/sub eff/) for multiple lines. Based on a look-up table for L/sub eff/, an equivalent single line model can be generated to decouple a specific signal line from the others to perform static timing analysis. Compared to the use of full RLC netlists for multiple lines, this approach greatly improves the computational efficiency and maintains accuracy for timing and signal integrity analysis. We apply these models to repeater insertion in critical paths and find that, for a single line, the RLC model minimizes delay with fewer number of repeaters than RC model. However, for multiple lines, we find that same number of repeaters is inserted for optimal delay according to both the RC and RLC models.",

Interconnect predictions are at the core of technology extrapolation models of achievable sys- tem power, area density and speed. Technology extrapolation, in turn, informs a priori interconnect prediction via models of inter- connect technology and interconnect optimizations. In this paper, we address the linkage between a priori interconnect prediction and technology extrapolation in two ways. First, we describe how rapid changes in technology, as well as rapid evolution of predic- tion methods, require a dynamic and flexible framework for tech- nology extrapolation. We then develop a new tool, the GSRC Technology Extrapolation System (GTX), which allows capture of such knowledge and rapid development of new studies. Second, we identify several \"non-traditional\" facets of interconnect prediction and quantify their impact on key technology extrapolations. In particular, we explore the effects of interconnect design optimiza- tions such as shield insertion, repeater sizing and repeater stag- gering, as well as modeling choices for RLC interconnects.",

Based on the derivation of surface potential, the new model accurately predicts both I-V and C-V characteristics. It is scalable to key process and design parameters, such as the diameter, chirality, contact materials, gate dielectrics, and bias voltages. Without any iteration in model computation, the proposed model significantly enhances the simulation efficiency for large-scale design research. By benchmarking circuit performance, the optimal space of the CNT process is further localized. It is observed that for a Schottky-barrier CNT transistor with the diameter range of 1-1.5 nm, the circuit can be more than 8&times; faster than that of 22-nm CMOS, with the tolerance to the variation in contact materials.",

        "abstract": "As technology scales, the aging effect caused by Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has become a major reliability concerns for circuit designers. Consequently, we have seen a lot of research efforts on NBTI analysis and mitigation techniques. On the other hand, reducing leakage power remains to be one of the major design goals. Both NBTI-induced circuit degradation and standby leakage power have a strong dependency on the input patterns of circuits. In this paper, we propose a co-simulation flow to study NBTI-induced circuit degradation and leakage power, taking into account the different behaviors between circuit active and standby time. Based on this flow, we evaluate the efficacy of Input Vector Control (IVC) technique on mitigating circuit aging and reducing standby leakage power with experiments on bench-mark circuits that are implemented in 90nm, 65nm, and 45nm technology nodes. The IVC technique is proved to be effective to mitigate NBTI-induced circuit degradation, saving up to 56% circuit performance degradation at 65nm technology node, and on average 30% circuit performance degradation across different technology nodes. Meanwhile, IVC technique can save up to 18% of the worst case leak-age power. Since leakage power and NBTI-induced circuit degradation have different dependencies on the input patterns, we propose to derive Pareto sets for designers to explore trade-offs between the life-time reliability and leakage power.",

In this paper, we develop a hierarchical framework for analyzing the impact of NBTI on the performance of logic circuits under various operation conditions, such as the supply voltage, temperature, and node switching activity. Given a circuit topology and input switching activity, we propose an efficient method to predict the degradation of circuit speed over a long period of time. The effectiveness of our method is comprehensively demonstrated with the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) benchmarks and a 65-nm industrial design. Furthermore, we extract the following key design insights for reliable circuit design under NBTI effect, including: 1) During dynamic operation, NBTI-induced degradation is relatively insensitive to supply voltage, but strongly dependent on temperature; 2) There is an optimum supply voltage that leads to the minimum of circuit performance degradation; circuit degradation rate actually goes up if supply voltage is lower than the optimum value; 3) Circuit performance degradation due to NBTI is highly sensitive to input vectors. The difference in delay degradation is up to 5\u00d7 for various static and dynamic operations. Finally, we examine the interaction between NBTI effect, and process and design uncertainty in realistic conditions.",

The cross-point array architecture with synaptic devices has been proposed for on-chip implementation of the weighted sum and weight update in the learning algorithms. In this work, forming-free, silicon-process-compatible Ta/TaO x /TiO2/Ti synaptic devices are fabricated, in which >200 levels of conductance states could be continuously tuned by identical programming pulses. In order to demonstrate the advantages of parallelism of the cross-point array architecture, a novel fully parallel write scheme is designed and experimentally demonstrated in a small-scale crossbar array to accelerate the weight update in the training process, at a speed that is independent of the array size. Compared to the conventional row-by-row write scheme, it achieves >30\u00d7 speed-up and >30\u00d7 improvement in energy efficiency as projected in a large-scale array. If realistic synaptic device characteristics such as device variations are taken into an array-level simulation, the proposed array architecture is able to achieve \u223c95% recognition accuracy of MNIST handwritten digits, which is close to the accuracy achieved by software using the ideal sparse coding algorithm.",

Existing RTN simulation approaches mainly focus on single trap induced RTN and transient response of RTN, which are usually time-consuming for circuit-level simulation. This paper proposes a statistical algorithm to study multiple traps induced RTN in digital circuits, to show the temporal distribution of circuit delay under RTN. Based on the simulation results we show how to protect circuit from RTN. Bias dependence of RTN is also discussed.",

To accurately extract its paratactic capacitance for circuit simulation, compact models should be scalable with wire geometries and should capture the latest technology advances, such as the air gap and Cu diffusion barrier. This paper achieves these goals based on the distribution of the electric field in on-chip BEOL structures. By decomposing the electric field into various regions, the proposed method physically solves each basic capacitance component into a closed-form solution; the total ground and coupling capacitances are then the sum of all related components. Such a component-based approach is convenient in incorporating new interconnect structures. Its physics basis minimizes the complexity and the error in a traditional model fitting process. Compared with Raphael simulations at the 45-nm node, the new compact model accurately predicts the capacitance value, even in the presence of the air gap and diffusion barrier, covering a wide range of BEOL dimensions. The complete set of equations will be implemented at http://www.eas.asu.edu/~ptm.",

Yet the difficulty in the integration of on-chip inductors still limits its application in practice. This paper resolves such a key issue with sub-50 \u00c2\u00bfm magnetic inductors, which are fully compatible with the CMOS process. These inductors leverage soft magnetic coils to achieve inductances up to 4nH, Q-factor of 3 at 1 GHz with a device diameter of only 30-50 \u00c2\u00bfm, resulting in area savings of nearly 100X as compared to conventional design. The latency and noise performance of the resonant clock network is demonstrated to be comparable to those using conventional inductors without soft magnetic materials. In addition, inductors with integrated magnetic materials significantly reduce mutual coupling and eddy current loss in the power grid below the clock network. These design advantages enable high density of on-chip distributed oscillators, providing better phase averaging, lower power and superior noise characteristics as compared to traditional buffer-tree based clock network.",

        "abstract": "Suppressing the leakage current in memories is critical in low-power design. By reducing the standby supply voltage (VDD) to its limit, which is the data retention voltage (DRV), leakage power can be substantially reduced. This paper explores how low DRV can be in a standard low leakage SRAM module and analyzes how DRV is affected by parameters such as process variations, chip temperature, and transistor sizing. An analytical model for DRV as a function of process and design parameters is presented, and forms the basis for further design space explorations. This model is verified using simulations as well as measurements from a 4 kB SRAM chip in a 0.13 \u03bcm technology. It is demonstrated that an SRAM cell state can be preserved at sub-300 mV standby VDD, with more than 90% leakage power savings.",

        "abstract": "Matrix-vector multiplication is the key operation for many computationally intensive algorithms. The emerging metal oxide resistive switching random access memory (RRAM) device and RRAM crossbar array have demonstrated a promising hardware realization of the analog matrix-vector multiplication with ultra-high energy efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the impact of both device level and circuit level non-ideal factors, including the nonlinear current-voltage relationship of RRAM devices, the variation of device fabrication and write operation, and the interconnect resistance as well as other crossbar array parameters. On top of that, we propose a technological exploration flow for device parameter configuration to overcome the impact of non-ideal factors and achieve a better trade-off among performance, energy, and reliability for each specific application. Our simulation results of a support vector machine (SVM) and Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) pattern recognition dataset show that RRAM crossbar array based SVM is robust to input signal fluctuation but sensitive to tunneling gap deviation. A further resistance resolution test presents that a 6-bit RRAM device is able to realize a recognition accuracy around 90\u00a0%, indicating the physical feasibility of RRAM crossbar array based SVM. In addition, the proposed technological exploration flow is able to achieve 10.98\u00a0% improvement of recognition accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 26.4\u00a0% energy savings compared with previous work. Experimental results also show that more than 84.4\u00a0% power saving can be achieved at the cost of little accuracy reduction.",

In this work, we present a unified approach that directly predicts the change of key transistor parameters under various process and design conditions, for both negative-bias-temperature-instability (NBTI) and CHC degradation. Using the general reaction-diffusion model and the concept of surface potential, the proposed method continuously captures the performance degradation across subthreshold and strong inversion regions.

And the growing process variations can no longer be ignored. Meanwhile, reducing leakage power remains to be one of the design goals. In this paper, we first present a platform for NBTI-aware statistical timing and leakage power analysis. A variation-aware supply voltage assignment (SVA) technique combining dual Vdd assignment and dynamic Vdd scaling techniques is proposed to minimize NBTI degradation and leakage. Based on the statistical platform, we analyze the impact of Vth variations on NBTI degradation and leakage. The experimental results show that our SVA technique can mitigate on average 52.98% of NBTI degradation with little or without leakage power increase; furthermore, it can reduce on average 32.46% more leakage power compared with the pure single Vdd scaling technique. Compared with scheduled voltage scaling technique [9], our dynamic scaling technique is more effective because the circuit delay will exactly meet the specification at each dynamically decided time node during circuit operation.",

        "abstract": "Timing uncertainty caused by inductive and capacitive coupling is one of the major bottlenecks in timing analysis. In this paper, we propose an effective loop RLC modeling technique to efficiently decouple lines with both inductive and capacitive coupling. We generalize the RLC decoupling problem based on the theory of distributed RLC lines and a switch-factor, which is the voltage ratio between two nets. This switch-factor is also known as the Miller factor, and is widely used to model capacitive coupling. The proposed modeling technique can be directly applied to partial RLC netlists extracted using existing parasitic extraction tools without advance knowledge of the return path. The new model captures the impact of neighboring switching activity as it significantly affects the current return path. As demonstrated in our experiments, the new model accurately predicts both upper and lower delay bounds as a function of neighboring switching patterns. Therefore, this approach can be easily implemented into existing timing analysis flows such as max-timing and min-timing analysis. Finally, we apply the new modeling approach to a range of activities across the design process including timing optimization, static timing analysis, high frequency clock design, and data-bus wire planning.",

Interconnect predictions are at the core of technology extrapolation models of achievable system power, area density, and speed. Technology extrapolation, in turn, informs a priori interconnect prediction via models of interconnect technology and interconnect optimizations. In this paper, we address the linkage between a priori interconnect prediction and technology extrapolation in two ways. First, we describe how rapid changes in technology, as well as rapid evolution of prediction methods, require a dynamic and flexible framework for technology extrapolation. We then develop a new tool, the GSRC technology extrapolation system (GTX), which allows capture of such knowledge and rapid development of new studies. Second, we identify several \"nontraditional\" facets of interconnect prediction and quantify their impact on key technology extrapolations. In particular, we explore the effects of interconnect design optimizations such as shield insertion, repeater sizing and repeater staggering, as well as modeling choices for RLC interconnects.",

Using a log-normal statistical model, Monte-Carlo analyses are performed on typical circuit examples, including an inverter chain, NAND gate, and 4-bit adder. While energy reduction can be effectively achieved by tuning supply voltage (Vdd), threshold voltage (Vth), and de- vice width (W), circuit yield degrades during this process.

        "abstract": "Negative-bias-temperature-instability (NBTI) has become the primary limiting factor of circuit lifetime. In this work, we develop a general framework for analyzing the impact of NBTI on the performance of a circuit, based on various circuit parameters such as the supply voltage, temperature, and node switching activity of the signals etc. We propose an efficient method to predict the degradation of circuit performance based on circuit topology and the switching activity of the signals over long periods of time. We demonstrate our results on ISCAS benchmarks and a 65nm industrial design. The framework is used to provide key design insights for designing reliable circuits. The key design insights that we obtain are: (1) degradation due to NBTI is most sensitive on the input patterns and the duty cycle; the difference in the delay degradation can be up to 5X for various static and dynamic conditions, (2) during dynamic operation, NBTI-induced degradation is relatively insensitive to supply voltage, but strongly dependent on temperature; (3) NBTI has marginal impact on the clock signal.",

Among the aging mechanisms, wearout resulting from Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is of particular concern in deep submicron technology generations. While there has been significant effort at the device and circuit level to model and characterize the impact of NBTI, the analysis of NBTI's impact at the architectural level is still at its infancy. To facilitate architectural level aging analysis, a tool capable of evaluating NBTI vulnerabilities early in the design cycle has been developed that evaluates timing degradation due to NBTI. The tool includes workload-based temperature and performance degradation analysis across a variety of technologies and operating conditions, revealing a complex interplay between factors influencing NBTI timing degradation.",

During the past few years, researchers have spent considerable and continuous efforts on modeling and characterization of NBTI-caused delay degradation at different design levels. Searching for solutions which can effectively reduce NBTI impact on circuit delay is still under way. In this work, we use node criticality computation to drive NBTI aware timing analysis and optimization. Circuits after being applied this optimization flow show strong resistance to NBTI delay degradation. Particularly, for the first time, we propose node criticality computation algorithm under the NBTI aware timing analysis and optimization framework and give answers to the following questions which have not been answered yet. They are: (1) how to define node criticality in a circuit under NBTI effect; (2) how to find the critical nodes which once are protected NBTI timing degradation will be effectively reduced. Experimental results show that by protecting the critical nodes found by this framework, circuit delay degradation can be reduced by up to 50%.",

Examples include IMOS and FBFET that are operated in a non-equilibrium condition to rapidly generate mobile carriers. More recently, Fe-FET was proposed to improve the switching by integrating a ferroelectric material as gate insulator in a MOSFET structure. Under particular circumstance, ferroelectric capacitance is effectively negative, due to the negative slope of its polarization-electrical field (P-E) curve. This property makes the ferroelectric layer a voltage amplifier to boost surface potential, achieving fast transition. In this paper: (1) A new threshold voltage model is developed to capture the feedback of negative capacitance and IV characteristics of Fe-FET; (2) It is further revealed that the impact of random dopant fluctuation (RDF) on leakage variability can be significantly suppressed in Fe-FET, by tuning the thickness of the ferroelectric layer.",

Accurate statistical aging prediction is essential in order to develop robust guard banding and protection strategies during the design stage. Variations in device level and supply voltage due to Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) need to be considered in aging analysis. The statistical device data collected from 65nm test chip shows that degradation behavior derived from trapping/detrapping mechanism is accurate under statistical variations compared to conventional Reaction Diffusion (RD) theory. The unique features of this work include (1) Aging model development as a function of technology parameters based on trapping/detrapping theory (2) Reliability prediction under device variations and DVS with solid validation with using 65nm statistical silicon data (3) Asymmetric aged timing analysis under NBTI and comprehensive evaluation of our framework in ISCAS89 sequential circuits. Further, we show that RD based NBTI model significantly overestimates the degradation and TD model correctly captures aging variability. These results provide design insights under statistical NBTI aging and enhance the prediction efficiency.",

Traditional aging analysis does not differentiate NBTI induced delay shift in rising and falling edges, thereby assuming averaging effect due to recovery. It is essential to identify the critical operation conditions that are more susceptible to timing violations under aging. In this paper, by identifying the critical moments in circuit operation and considering the asymmetric aging effects, timing violations under NBTI effect are correctly predicted. The unique features of this work include: (1) delay modeling of a digital gate due to threshold voltage (Vth) shift using delay dependence on supply voltage from cell library; (2) asymmetric aging analysis is conducted by recognizing the critical points in circuit operation; and (3) setup and hold timing violations due to NBTI induced path delay shift in logic and clock buffer are investigated. This failure assessment method is further demonstrated in ISCAS89 benchmark circuits using 45nm Nangate standard cell library to extract aging information in critical paths. The proposed failure diagnosis enables resilient design techniques to mitigate circuit aging under NBTI.\n\n",

Our framework introduces dynamic cooling as one of the self-tuning parameters, in addition to supply voltage and clock frequency. Our optimized self-tuning satisfies performance constraints at all times and maximizes a lifetime computational power efficiency (LCPE) metric, which is defined as the total number of clock cycles achieved over lifetime divided by the total energy consumed over lifetime. Our framework features three control policies: 1. Progressive-worst-case-aging (PWCA), which assumes worst-case aging at all times; 2. Progressive-on-state-aging (POSA), which estimates aging by tracking active/sleep mode, and then assumes worst-case aging in active mode and long recovery effects in sleep mode; 3. Progressive-real-time-aging-assisted (PRTA), which estimates the actual amount of aging and initiates optimized control action. Simulation results on benchmark circuits, using aging models validated by 45nm CMOS stress measurements, demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach. We also analyze design constraints and derive system design guidelines to maximize self-tuning benefits.",

        "abstract": "The design and development of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) ICs is becoming increasingly expensive, complex, and lengthy. Lacking a reconfigurable platform, analog designers are denied the benefits of rapid prototyping, hardware emulation, and smooth migration to advanced technology nodes. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a new approach that maps any AMS design problem to a transistor-level reconfigurable vehicle, thus enabling fast validation and a reduction in post-Silicon bugs, and minimizing design risk and costs. The unique features of the approach include: (1) transistor-level programmability that emulates each transistor behavior in an analog design, reproducing the system and achieving very fine granularity of reconfiguration; (2) programmable switches that are treated as a design component during analog transistor mapping, and optimized with the reconfiguration matrix; (3) parasitics reduction that leverages the aggressive scaling of CMOS technology. Based on these principles, a digitally controlled PANDA platform is designed at a 32nm node. Several 90nm analog blocks are successfully emulated with the 32nm platform, including a folded-cascode operational amplifier, a sample-and-hold module (S/H), and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). A solid basis to future efforts on the architecture, hierarchical optimization, and related design automation tools is demonstrated.",

Traditional aging models assume constant voltage and averaged activity factor, ignoring the impact of the long sleep period, and thus, result in a significant overestimation of the degradation rate. To accurately predict the aging effect in low-power design, this work first examines critical model assumptions in the reaction-diffusion process that is responsible for the NBTI effect. By using the correct diffusion profile, it then proposes a new aging model that effectively analyzes the degradation under various low-power operations. The new model well predicts the aging behavior of scaled CMOS measurement data (45 nm and 65 nm) with different operation patterns, especially sleep mode operation and dynamic voltage scaling. Compared to previous aging models, the new result captures the essential role of the long recovery phase in circuit aging, reducing unnecessary guardbanding in reliability protection.",

        "abstract": "Face detection is a critical function in many embedded applications, such as computer vision and security. Although face detection has been well studied, detecting a large number of faces with different scales and excessive variations (pose, expression, or illumination) usually involves computationally expensive classification algorithms. These algorithms may divide an image into sub-windows at different scales, evaluate a large set of features for each sub-window, and determine the presence and location of a face. Even with state-of-the-art CPUs, it is still challenging to perform real-time face detection with sufficiently high energy efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a suite of acceleration techniques to enable such a capability on the CPU-FPGA platform, based on a state-of-the-art face detection algorithm that employs a large number of simple classifiers. We first map the algorithm using the integrated OpenCL environment for FPGA. Matching the structure of the algorithm, a nested architecture is proposed to speed up both memory access and the computing iterations.

This model is derived by solving the Poisson's equation with the parabolic potential approximation, channel length transformation and conformai mapping. The analytic body center potential solution is presented. Compared with TCAD simulations, the proposed model shows good agreements, with different dimensions of the structure and varied bias conditions. The model here is appropriate for predicting the effect of gate misalignment or asymmetric gate underlap in GAA MOSFETs' design.",

Together with predictive interconnect models, we project performance and power landscape for the technology nodes from 20nm to 7nm.

In this paper a closed-form solution is proposed to predict the variability in gate timing, which significantly reduces computation cost in statistical analysis. The proposed model covers both nominal delay and its variability across a wide range of device sizes, load capacitances and input transition times. Stack effect, such as that in NAND and NOR gates, is taken into account thereby making the model sensitive to the switching patterns. For ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits, implemented using a 45nm library, the model demonstrates high accuracy with less than 3.5% error for nominal delay and within 5ps variation of the critical path. Finally, use of the proposed model in design flow is demonstrated for setup time violations.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotube transistor (CNT) is promising to be the technology of choice for nanoscale integration. In this work, we develop the first compact model of CNT, with the objective to explore the optimal process and design space for robust low-power applications. Based on the concept of the surface potential, the new model accurately predicts the characteristics of a CNT device under various process and design conditions, such as diameter, chirality, gate dielectrics, and bias voltages. With the physical modeling of the contact, this model covers both the Schottky-barrier CNT (SB-CNT) and MOS-type CNT. The proposed model does not require any iteration and thus, significantly enhances the simulation efficiency to support large-scale design research. Using this model, we benchmark the performance of a FO4 inverter with CNT and 22nm CMOS technology. The following key insights are extracted: (1) even with the SB-CNT and realistic layout parasitics, the circuit speed can be more than 10X that of 22nm CMOS; (2) The diameter range of 1-1.5nm exhibits the maximum tolerance to contact materials and process variations; (3) a CNT circuit allows better scaling of the supply voltage (Vdd) for power reduction. For a fixed energy consumption and Vdd, the CNT speed is 4X that of 22nm CMOS. Overall, the new model enables efficient design research with CNT, revealing tremendous opportunities for both high-speed and low-power applications.",

The results show that pull down transistor dominates static noise margin (SNM) fluctuation and access transistor dominates write margin (WM) fluctuation.",

        "abstract": "Integrated circuit design in the late CMOS era is challenged by the ever-increasing variability and reliability issues. The situation is further compounded by real-time uncertainties in workload and ambient conditions, which dynamically influence the degradation rate. To improve design predictability and guarantee system lifetime, accurate modeling, and simulation tools for reliability are essential to both digital and analog circuits. This paper presents cross-layer solutions for emerging reliability threats, including: 1) device-level modeling of reliability mechanisms, such as transistor aging and its statistical behavior; 2) circuit-level long-term aging models that capture unique operation patterns in digital and analog design, and directly predict the degradation; and 3) simulation methods for very-large-scale designs. Built on the long-term model, the new methods significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reliability analysis. As validated by silicon data, these solutions close the gap between the underlying reliability physics and circuit/system design for resilience.",

        "abstract": "With the continuous reduction of CMOS device dimension, the importance of Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) keeps growing. To determine its impact on circuit performance and optimize the design, it is essential to physically model RTN effect and embed it into the standard simulation environment. In this paper, a new simulation method of time domain RTN effect is proposed to benchmark important digital circuits: (1) A two-stage L-shaped circuit is proposed to generate RTN signal by integrating a white noise source. An L-shaped circuit is a RC filter connected with an ideal comparator, where RC values are calibrated with the physical property of RTN; (2) This sub-circuit is fully compatible with SPICE, enabling the time domain analysis in nanometer scale digital design; (3) The importance of discrete RTN is demonstrated on a 32nm SRAM design and a 22nm low power ring oscillator (RO), using the proposed method. As compared to traditional 1/f noise, the impact of RTN is more significant under low voltages, leading to tremendous differences in the prediction of Vccmin and failure probability in SRAM, as well as jitter noise in RO.",

Depending on their sources, they are often categorized into two types: intrinsic variations and process-induced variations [1][2]. Process-induced variations are caused by the imperfection in silicon fabrication, varying from foundries to foundries. On the other side, intrinsic variations, induced by atom-level charge and geometry fluctuations, are inherent to the device structure. They are limited by fundamental physics, posing one of the ultimate barriers to continual technology scaling. Examples of intrinsic variations include random dopant fluctuation (RDF), line edge roughness (LER), and oxide thickness fluctuation (OTF) [2]. Their importance is rapidly increasing as device feature size approaches the atom dimension.",

A function of mean and variance of the circuit leakage is minimized with constraint on \u03b1-percentile of the delay using physical delay models. Since the leakage is a strong function of the threshold voltage and gate length, considering them as design variables can provide significant amount of power savings. The leakage minimization problem is formulated as a multivariable convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that statistical optimization can lead to more than 37% savings in nominal leakage compared to worst-case techniques that perform only gate sizing.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid memory, where the DRAM acts as a buffer to the PRAM, is a promising configuration for main memory systems. It has the advantages of fast access time, high storage density and very low standby power. However, it also has reliability issues that need to be addressed. This paper focuses on low cost Error Control Coding (ECC)-based schemes for improving the reliability of hybrid memory. We propose three candidate systems that all guarantee block failure rate of 10-8 but differ in whether the DRAM and/or PRAM data get coded and the strength of the corresponding ECC code. The candidate systems are evaluated with respect to lifetime, Instruction Per Cycle (IPC) and energy. We show that (1) at lower Data Storage Time (DST), the proposed system which has different ECC schemes for DRAM and PRAM has the longest lifetime and one of the highest IPC; (2) at higher DST, stronger ECC codes are necessary for all the systems and longer lifetime can be achieved at the cost of decrease in IPC.",

Projection of SET sensitivity with scaling is essential to assess the logic failure and error probability in modern technology generations.

The failure due to particle strikes i.e., Single Event upsets (SEU) as well as its behavior with process variations and reliability mechanisms such as NBTI is evaluated in this work. The critical supply voltage required to avoid SET propagation with circuit parameters is investigated. This work also proposes a probability model which examines the propagation of SET at any node to the output of a circuit.

The entire approach is demonstrated in a 90nm test chip with 32K cells. The advantages of the proposed method include: (1) a single-ended SRAM test structure with no disturbance to SRAM operations; (2) a convenient test procedure that only requires quasistatic control of external voltages; and (3) a non-iterative method that extracts the VTH variation of each transistor from eight measurements. The new procedure enables accurate predictions of SRAM performance variability.

        "abstract": "The BTI effect, which consists of both stress and recovery phases, poses a unique challenge to long-term aging prediction, because the degradation rate strongly depends on the stress pattern. Previous approaches usually resort to an average, constant stress waveform to simplify the situation. They are efficient, but fail to capture the reality, especially under dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) or in analog/mixed signal designs where the stress waveform is much more random. This paper presents a suite of solutions that enable aging simulation under all possible stress conditions. Key contributions include: (1) Compact modeling of BTI when the stress voltage is varying. The results to both reaction-diffusion (RD) and trapping/detrapping (TD) mechanisms are derived. (2) Efficient simulation under DVS, leveraging the new BTI models; (3) Silicon validation at 45nm and 65nm, at both device and circuit levels. As the results illustrate, it is necessary to combine both RD and TD mechanisms to accurately predict aging under changing stress voltages. Our proposed work provides a general and comprehensive solution to aging analysis under random stress patterns.",

        "abstract": "Strain technology has been successfully integrated into CMOS fabrication to improve carrier transport properties since 90 nm node. Due to the non-uniform stress distribution in the channel, the enhancement in carrier mobility, velocity, and threshold voltage shift strongly depend on circuit layout, leading to systematic performance variations among transistors. A compact stress model that physically captures this behavior is essential to bridge the process technology with design optimization. In this paper, starting from the first principle, a new layout-dependent stress model is proposed as a function of layout, temperature, and other device parameters. Furthermore, a method of layout decomposition is developed to partition the layout into a set of simple patterns for efficient model extraction. These solutions significantly reduce the complexity in stress modeling and simulation. They are comprehensively validated by TCAD simulation and published Si-data, including the state-of-the-art strain technologies and the STI stress effect. By embedding them into circuit analysis, the interaction between layout and circuit performance is well benchmarked at 45 nm node.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new methodology that characterizes aging-duty cycle and aging-supply voltage relationships that are applicable to minimizing power consumption and task execution time to achieve low Bit-Energy-Ratio (BER). In contrast to the traditional workload balancing scheme where cores are regarded as homogeneous, we proposed a new task scheduler that ranks cores according to their various competitiveness evaluated based upon their reliability, temperature and timing requirements. Consequently, the new approach combines internal characteristics (aging-duty cycle and aging-supply voltage curves) into an integrated framework to achieve system performance improvement or graceful degradation with high reliability and low power. Experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved 18% power reduction with about 4% performance degradation (in terms of accomplished workload) compared with traditional workload balancing methods.",

These memories have reliability issues that need to be better understood before they can be adopted as a mainstream memory technology. In this paper, we first study the causes of errors for a single STT memory cell. We see that process variations and variations in the device geometry affect their failure rate and develop error models to capture these effects. Next we propose a joint technique based on tuning of circuit level parameters and error control coding (ECC) to achieve very high reliability. Such a combination allows the use of weaker ECC with smaller overhead. For instance, we show that by applying voltage boosting and write pulse width adjustment, the error correction capability (t) of ECC can be reduced from t=11 to t=3 to achieve a block failure rate (BFR) of 10^-9.",

To maximize power saving, shorter pulse width and longer propagation length are preferred. In this work, a complete set of analytical models are developed for pulse propagation along RLC lines. These models connect line geometries and electrical properties of an input pulse with several important design metrics, such as delay, pulse width, maximum propagation length, and power saving. Excellent model accuracy is achieved as compared to SPICE simulations. These models can be easily implemented into design tools to facilitate the optimization of pulse signaling on lossy on-chip global buses. Furthermore, pulse signaling can be integrated with a time-division scheme to further reduce power consumption. Using the newly developed models, it is demonstrated that more than 70% dynamic power can be saved in this scheme in on-chip bus design.",

Traditional methods involve subjective evaluation by care providers or patient self-reports. As an alternative, we propose an objective method for monitoring cough using a wearable microphone. We collected 24-hour audio recordings from 9 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and lung cancer using the VitaloJAK wearable microphone. Trained professionals carefully listened to each audio stream and manually labeled each cough event. Using this data, we propose a new neural-network-based cough detection scheme. A pre-processing algorithm is used to estimate the start and end of each cough and the deep neural network is trained using each cough instance. Experiments demonstrate an average leave-one-participant-out cross-validation specificity and sensitivity of 93.7% and 97.6% respectively.",

        "abstract": "Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is the leading factor of circuit performance degradation. Due to its complex dependence on operating conditions, especially signal probability, it is a tremendous challenge to accurately predict the degradation rate in reality. On the other hand, we demonstrate in this work that it is feasible to reliably predict the relative importance of gates under NBTI. By identifying critical gates that are the most important ones for timing degradation, we will be able to effectively protect the circuit from aging, with the minimum design overhead. The proposed method is based on a new timing analysis framework that integrates a NBTI-aware library. For each potential critical path, we prove that there exists a particular signal probability, which leads to the worst case of timing degradation. The search of such worst case signal probability provides a safe guardband for the degradation, yet avoiding overly pessimistic analysis. By applying this method to ISCAS and ITC benchmark circuits at the 65nm node, we demonstrate that in average only 1% of total gates need to be protected in order to control the timing degradation within 10% in ten years. Since this method only requires one-time analysis of each critical path, it is very efficient in computation. With the information of critical gates available, it further enables other resilient design techniques to mitigate circuit aging under NBTI.",

        "abstract": "As technology scales, the aging effect caused by Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has become a major reliability concern for circuit designers. On the other hand, reducing leakage power remains to be one of the design goals. Because both NBTI-induced circuit degradation and standby leakage power have a strong dependency on the input vectors, Input Vector Control (IVC) technique may be adopted to mitigate leakage and NBTI. However, IVC technique is in-effective for larger circuits. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two fast gate replacement algorithms together with optimal input vector selection to simultaneously mitigate leakage power and NBTI induced circuit degradation: Direct Gate Replacement (DGR) algorithm and Divide and Conquer Based Gate Replacement (DCBGR) algorithm. Our experimental results on 20 benchmark circuits at 65nm technology node reveal that: 1) Both DGR and DCBGR algorithms outperform pure IVC about on average 20% for three different object functions: leakage power reduction only, NBTI mitigation only, and leakage/NBTI co-optimization. 2) The DCBGR algorithm leads to better optimization results and save on average 100X runtime compared with the DGR algorithm.",

        "abstract": "As more devices are integrated with technology scaling, reducing the power consumption of both high-performance and low-power processors has become the first-class design constraint. Reducing power consumption while satisfying required performance is critical for increasing the operating time of mobile devices and lowering the operating cost of offices and data centers. Meanwhile, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and clock-gating (CG) techniques have been widely used for two of the most powerful techniques to reduce the power consumption of such processors. Depending on performance and power demands, a processor runs at various performance and power states to trade power with performance. In this paper, we propose process tuning strategy to minimize the average power consumption of multi-core processors that use the DVFS and CG techniques, while providing the same maximum performance. The proposed optimization method incorporates with workload characteristics of commercial high-performance and low-power multi-core processors. The experimental results show that our optimized 32nm technologies for workstation, mobile, and server multi-core processors minimize the average power by up to 13, 18, and 9%, respectively.",

A novel read and write scheme is designed to accelerate the training process, which realizes fully parallel operations of the weighted sum and the weight update. Furthermore, technology and design parameters of the resistive cross-point array are co-optimized to enhance the learning accuracy, latency and energy consumption, etc. In contrast to the conventional memory design, a set of reverse scaling rules is proposed on the resistive cross-point array to achieve high learning accuracy. These include 1) larger wire width to reduce the IR drop on interconnects thereby increasing the learning accuracy; 2) use of multiple cells for each weight element to alleviate the impact of the device variations, at an affordable expense of area, energy and latency. The optimized resistive cross-point array with peripheral circuitry is implemented at the 65 nm node. Its performance is benchmarked for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST database using gradient-based sparse coding. Compared to state-of-the-art software approach running on CPU, it achieves >103 speed-up and >106 energy efficiency improvement, enabling real-time image feature extraction and learning.",

        "abstract": "An analytical gate delay model is developed by integrating short-channel effects and the Alpha-power law-based timing model. As verified with an industrial 90-nm technology, this analytical approach accurately predicts both nominal delay and delay variability over a wide range of power supply conditions including subthreshold and strong- inversion regions. Excellent model scalability enables efficient mapping between process variations and delay variability at the gate level. Based on this model, the impact of various physical effects on delay variability has been identified. While the variation of effective channel length is the leading source for delay variability at the current 90-nm node, delay variability is actually more sensitive to the variation of threshold voltage, especially in the subthreshold region. Furthermore, the limitation of low-power design techniques is investigated in the presence of process variations, particularly dual Vth and L biasing. These techniques become less effective at low VDD due to excessive delay variability.",

The Gigascale Systems Research Center Resilient-System Design Team is addressing these key challenges through synergistic research thrusts, ranging from near-term reliability stress reduction techniques to methods for improving the quality of today's silicon, to longer-term technologies that can detect, recover, and repair faulty systems. These efforts are supported and complemented by an active fault-modeling research effort and a strong focus on functional-verification methodologies.

Much research has focused on the modeling of spatial correlation in SSTA. However, the vast majority of these works used artificially generated process data to test the proposed models. Hence, it is difficult to determine the actual effectiveness of these methods, the conditions under which they are necessary, and whether they lead to a significant increase in accuracy that warrants their increased runtime and complexity. In this paper, we study 5 different correlation models and their associated SSTA methods using 35420 critical dimension (CD) measurements that were extracted from 23 reticles on 5 wafers in a 130nm CMOS process. Based on the measured CD data, we analyze the correlation as a function of distance and generate 5 distinct correlation models, ranging from simple models which incorporate one or two variation components to more complex models that utilize principle component analysis and Quad-trees. We then study the accuracy of the different models and compare their SSTA results with the result of running STA directly on the extracted data. We also examine the trade-off between model accuracy and run time, as well as the impact of die size on model accuracy. We show that, especially for small dies (",

The absence of a gate-oxide makes the SOI MESFET extremely robust, able to withstand high voltages, and useful for extreme environment electronics. The device has been fabricated using a standard CMOS process. In contrast to SOI MOSFETs and GaAs MESFETs, the source-substrate voltage has a significant impact on the channel current. In this work a model has been developed that includes the effect of the buried-oxide on the performance of the MESFET. The model has been verified for a wide temperature range of -180\u00a2\u964bC to 150\u00a2\u964bC. A behavioral model has been included to model the breakdown voltage. The core DC and RF models have been adapted from the commercially available Triquint\u9686\u7089s Own Model (TOM3) MESFET model. A measurement-based approach is used to develop a 4-terminal device model. The charge-based approach, using S-parameter measurements was used to develop the capacitance model. We also propose a wide-temperature compensation technique by source-voltage modulation.",

        "abstract": "Timing characterization of standard cells is one of the essential steps in VLSI design. The traditional static timing analysis (STA) tool assumes single input switching models for the characterization of multiple input gates. However, due to technology scaling, increasing operating frequency, and process variation, the probability of the occurrence of multiple input switching (MIS) is increasing. On the other hand, considering all possible MIS scenarios for the characterization of multiple input logic gates, is computationally intensive. To improve the efficiency, this work proposes a finite-point-based characterization methodology for multiple input gates with the effects of MIS. Furthermore, delay variation due to MIS is integrated into the STA flow through propagation of switching windows. The proposed modeling methodology is validated using benchmark circuits at the 45nm technology node for various operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reduction in computation cost and data volume with less than \u223c10&percnt; error compared to that of traditional SPICE simulation.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in many computer vision applications such as image classification, face detection, and video analysis, because of their ability to train and classify with high accuracy. Due to multiple convolution and fully-connected layers that are compute-/memory-intensive, it is difficult to perform real-time classification with low power consumption on today?s computing systems. FPGAs have been widely explored as hardware accelerators for CNNs because of their reconfigurability and energy efficiency, as well as fast turn-around-time, especially with high-level synthesis methodologies. Previous FPGA-based CNN accelerators, however, typically implemented generic accelerators agnostic to the CNN configuration, where the reconfigurable capabilities of FPGAs are not fully leveraged to maximize the overall system throughput. In this work, we present a systematic design space exploration methodology to maximize the throughput of an OpenCL-based FPGA accelerator for a given CNN model, considering the FPGA resource constraints such as on-chip memory, registers, computational resources and external memory bandwidth. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by optimizing two representative large-scale CNNs, AlexNet and VGG, on two Altera Stratix-V FPGA platforms, DE5-Net and P395-D8 boards, which have different hardware resources. We achieve a peak performance of 136.5 GOPS for convolution operation, and 117.8 GOPS for the entire VGG network that performs ImageNet classification on P395-D8 board.",

This outcome is the result of (a) increasing sensitivity to various intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources as circuits shrink, and (b) a corresponding increase in parametric variability causing behavior similar to what would be expected with hard (topological) faults. This paper examines the issue of circuit resilience, then proposes and demonstrates a roadmap for evaluating fault rates starting at the 45nm and going down to the 12nm nodes.

        "abstract": "Rapid-Thermal Annealing (RTA) with radiation heating is recently adopted in nanoscale CMOS fabrication in order to achieve ultra-shallow junction with maximum dopant activation rate. However, recent results report the systematic shift of threshold voltage (Vth) and increased Vth variation due to RTA process [1--2]. The exact amount of variations depends on layout pattern density, RTA heating temperature (T) and effective annealing time. In this work, we develop joint thermal/TCAD simulation and compact modeling tools to analyze performance variability under various layout pattern densities and RTA conditions. With the new simulation capability, we recognize two major variation mechanisms under RTA: the change of effective channel length (Leff) induced by lateral dopant diffusion, and the fluctuation of equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) due to incomplete dopant activation. We perform device simulations to quantify transistor performance shift due to Leff and EOT variations. Moreover, we propose a suite of compact models that bridge the underlying RTA process with device parameter change for efficient design optimization. The new tools are validated with published silicon data at 45nm and 65nm nodes. They will facilitate physical designers to predict and mitigate circuit performance variability due to the layout-dependent RTA process.",

Traditional characterization of setup and hold time constraints is computationally intensive, due to the demand on high accuracy in monitoring the operation failure. To improve the efficiency, this work proposes a finite-point based method for the characterization of setup and hold time constraints. The finite-point method identifies several critical data points in the non-linear curve of timing characteristics, and abstracts the essential setup/hold information from them. Moreover, compact models are derived for each point, further reducing the computation cost. The proposed method is general for all sequential elements in the standard cell library. It is comprehensively validated using benchmark circuits at 45nm node. Experimental results demonstrate approximately 25\u00ed\u00bf reduction in characterization time, with the prediction error in setup and hold time within 9% of FO4 nominal delay, as compared to that of SPICE simulation results.

The new methodology characterizes aging-switching activity and aging-supply voltage relationships that are applicable for minimizing power consumption and task execution efficiency in order to achieve low bit energy ratio (BER). In addition, a new dynamic management algorithm (DMA) is proposed to alleviate device degradation and to extend system lifespan. In contrast to traditional workload balancing schemes in which cores are regarded as homogeneous, the new algorithm ranks cores as \u201chighly competitive,\u201d \u201cless competitive,\u201d and \u201cnot competitive\u201d according to their various competitiveness. Core competitiveness is evaluated based upon their reliability, temperature, and timing requirements. Consequently, \u201ccompetitive\u201d cores will take charge of the majority of the tasks at relatively high voltage/frequency without violating power and timing budgets, while \u201cnot competitive\u201d cores will have light workloads to ensure their reliability. The new approach combines intrinsic device characteristics (aging-switching activity and aging-supply voltage curves) into an integrated framework to achieve high reliability and low energy level with graceful degradation of system performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved up to 20&percnt; power reduction, with about 4&percnt; performance degradation (in terms of accomplished workload and system throughput), compared with traditional workload balancing methods. The new method also improves system mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by up to 25&percnt;.",

Although continual improvements in manufacturing processes are mitigating some of variability's negative effects, the semiconductor industry is starting to accept that some effects are better mitigated during the design phase. Handling variability in the design step will require accurate, consistent models of variability and its dependence on designable parameters, and of variability's spatial and temporal distributions. Such models are quite different from the \"corner\" models deployed thus far to model manufacturing variability. Consequently, the compact modeling of systematic, spatial, and random variations is essential to abstract the physical-level variations into a format that designers can use.",

During the past few years, researchers have spent considerable effort on accurate modeling and characterization of circuit delay degradation caused by NBTI at different design levels. The search for techniques and methodologies which can aid in effectively minimizing the NBTI effect on circuit delay is still underway. In this work, we present the usage of node criticality computation to drive NBTI-aware timing analysis and optimization. Circuits that have undergone this optimization flow show strong resistance to NBTI delay degradation. For the first time, this work proposes a node criticality computation algorithm under an NBTI-aware timing analysis and optimization framework. Our work provides answers to the following yet unaddressed questions: (a) what is the definition of node criticality in a circuit under the NBTI effect&quest; (b) how do we identify the critical nodes that, once protected, will be immune to NBTI timing degradation&quest; and (c) what are the NBTI effect attenuation approaches&quest; Experimental results indicate that by protecting the critical nodes found by our proposed methodology, circuit delay degradation can be reduced by up to 50&percnt;. Combined with peak temperature reduction, the delay degradation can be be further improved.",

        "abstract": "The threshold voltage (Vth) of a nanoscale transistor is severely affected by random dopant fluctuations and line-edge roughness. The analysis of these effects usually requires atomistic simulations that are too expensive computationally for statistical circuit design. In this work, we develop an efficient SPICE simulation method and statistical transistor model that accurately predict threshold variation as a function of dopant fluctuations and gate length change caused by sub-wavelength lithography and gate etching process. By understanding the physical principles of atomistic simulations, we (a) identify the appropriate method to divide a non-uniform gate into slices in order to map those fluctuations into the device model; (b) extract the variation of Vth from the strong-inversion region instead of the leakage current, benefiting from the linearity of the saturation current with respect to Vth and (c) propose a compact model of Vth variation that is scalable with gate size and the amount of dopant and gate length fluctuations. The proposed SPICE simulation method is fully validated against atomistic simulation results. Given the post-lithography gate geometry, this approach correctly models the variation of device output current in all operating regions. Based on the new results, we further project the amount of Vth variation at advanced technology nodes, to help shed light on the challenges of future robust circuit design.",

The framework incorporates the degradation of physical parameters such as threshold voltage (Vtp) into circuit simulation and enables the design of highly reliable circuits. The parameter degradation is based on the numerical solution for the reaction-diffusion (R-D) mechanism, which is a general model applicable to various reliability effects such as NBTI, HCI, NCS, and SEE. In particular, the accuracy and efficiency of this method was verified for NBTI degradation with 130nm experimental and simulation data over a wide range of stress voltages and temperature. The model also accurately captures the dependence of NBTI on multiple diffusion species (H/H2,), key process (Vth, tox) and environmental parameters (VDD, temperature). The circuit level performance of this method is verified with silicon data from ring-oscillator circuit. We also investigated the predicted impact of NBTI on representative digital circuits.",

This work correlates NTF diagnostic errors to Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI), a prominent failure degradation mode and self annealing mechanism in sub-100 nm CMOS technology. NBTI degradation is duplicated in laboratory experiments on 90 nm MPC7448 Freescale Microprocessors. Accelerated aging via in situ thermal and voltage cycling is conducted while benchmark scripts are running on the MPC7448. Faults observed include premature program termination, corruption of system services, L1 and L2 cache errors as reported by the kernel, and total system failure. After 8 hours of rest, the system boots up normally with no indication of system degradation. Final system failure is observed after several faults. Conventional Built-In Test (BIT) fails to detect these faults upon reboot of the system. Various control tests and test profiles are used to accelerate NBTI degradation on the microprocessor samples. The challenge of faulty behavior is distinguishing between health and degradation leading to failure. Analysis techniques are used to show separation between healthy and degraded data, and independent NBTI research at Arizona State University is used to correlate NBTI behavior to NTF diagnostic errors.1,2",

In addition, to provide good accuracy on output waveform, the new model creates the input and output capacitance elements as nonlinear dependency on input/output waveform and process variation parameters. Experimental results show that the generated gate model has less than 3.7% error at mean, less than 6.2% error at variance and less than 5.8% at 90% percentile for cumulative density functions (CDFs).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated framework, together with control policies, for optimizing dynamic control of self-tuning parameters of a digital system over its lifetime in the presence of circuit aging. A variety of self-tuning parameters such as supply voltage, operating clock frequency, and dynamic cooling are considered, and jointly optimized using efficient algorithms described in this paper. Our optimized self-tuning approach satisfies performance constraints at all times, and maximizes a lifetime computational power efficiency (LCPE) metric, which is defined as the total number of clock cycles achieved over lifetime divided by the total energy consumed over lifetime. We present three control policies: 1) progressive-worst-case-aging (PWCA), which assumes worst-case aging at all times; 2) progressive-on-state-aging (POSA), which estimates aging by tracking active/sleep modes, and then assumes worst-case aging in active mode and long recovery effects in sleep mode; and 3) progressive-real-time-aging-assisted (PRTA), which acquires real-time information and initiates optimized control actions. Various flavors of these control policies for systems with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) are also analyzed. Simulation results on benchmark circuits, using aging models validated by 45 nm measurements, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach in significantly improving LCPE and/or lifetime compared to traditional one-time worst-case guardbanding. We also derive system design guidelines to maximize self-tuning benefits.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the use of Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve Expansion (KLE) for accurate and efficient modeling of intra-die correlations in the semiconductor manufacturing process. We demonstrate that the KLE provides a significantly more accurate representation of the underlying stochastic process compared to the traditional approach of dividing the layout into grids and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By comparing the results of leakage analysis using both KLE and the existing approaches, we show that using KLE can provide up to 4-5x reduction in the variability space (number of random variables) while maintaining the same accuracy. We also propose an efficient leakage minimization algorithm that maximizes the leakage yield while satisfying probabilistic constraints on the delay.",

        "abstract": "Predictive MOSFET model is critical for early circuit design research. To accurately predict the characteristics of nanoscale CMOS, emerging physical effects, such as process variations and physical correlations among model parameters, must be included. In addition, predictions across technology generations should be smooth to make continuous extrapolations. In this work, a new generation of predictive technology model (PTM) is developed to accomplish these goals. Based on physical models and early stage silicon data, PTM of bulk CMOS for 130nm to 32nm technology nodes is successfully generated. By tuning ten parameters, PTM can be easily customized to cover a wide range of process uncertainties. The accuracy of PTM predictions is comprehensively verified: for NMOS, the error of Ion is 2% and for PMOS, it is 5%. Furthermore, the new PTM correctly captures process sensitivities in the nanometer regime. A webpage has been established for the release of PTM (http://www.eas.asu.edu/~ptm)",

        "abstract": "The threshold voltage (Vth) of a FinFET device varies between the on and off mode: Vth is lower when the transistor is on and it is higher when the transistor is off. Such a property is ideal for low-power designs with low supply voltage (Vdd). The low Vth provides high circuit speed even when Vdd is low, while the high standby Vth effectively controls the leakage. In this work, we exploit this property to achieve both high-speed and low-power operations. First, we develop an equivalent sub-circuit model of a FinFET transistor for design explorations. The accuracy of this model is verified with TCAD simulations. Then, we optimize key device parameters to obtain a large range of Vth between dynamic and standby mode: a thicker gate oxide and a thinner silicon body are desirable for this low-power design. Using the optimized FinFET device at 32nm node, we demonstrate that more than 35% reduction in total energy can be achieved without sacrificing the speed. We further benchmark the performance of representative logic and memory units under process variations.",

These 0.6mum depletion-mode SOI MESFETs exhibit a maximum breakdown voltage of 45V in spite of being fabricated using the standard 3.3V CMOS process. This high voltage capability makes the device a strong contender for applications such as power amplifiers, voltage controlled oscillators and DC-DC converters. DC and RF characterization involving breakdown voltage measurements, S-parameter measurements and small-signal parameter extraction was conducted on the device. We have customized an advanced, commercially available TOM3 SPICE MESFET model to represent the SOI MESFET. Based on extracted small-signal parameters, a simplified method to extract the charge parameters of the TOM3 capacitance model was developed.

This paper also discusses the peripheral circuits design considerations for the neuro-inspired architecture. Finally, a circuit-level macro simulator is developed to explore the design trade-offs and evaluate the overhead of the proposed mitigation strategies as well as project the scaling trend of the neuro-inspired architecture.",

        "abstract": "An array of multi-level resistive memory devices (RRAMs) can speed up the computation of deep learning algorithms. However, when a pre-trained model is programmed to a real RRAM array for inference, its accuracy degrades due to many non-idealities, such as variations, quantization error, and stuck-at faults. A conventional solution involves multiple read-verify-write (R-V-W) for each RRAM cell, costing a long time because of the slow Write speed and cell-by-cell compensation. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach to overcome this issue: random sparse adaptation (RSA) after the model is transferred to the RRAM array. By randomly selecting a small portion of model parameters and mapping them to on-chip memory for further training, we demonstrate an efficient and fast method to recover the accuracy: in CNNs for MNIST and CIFAR-10, \u223c5% of model parameters is sufficient for RSA even under excessive RRAM variations. As the back-propagation in training is only applied to RSA cells and there is no need of any Write operation on RRAM, the proposed RSA achieves 10\u2013100X acceleration compared to R-V-W. Therefore, this hybrid solution with a large, inaccurate RRAM array and a small, accurate on-chip memory array promises both area efficiency and inference accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a deep learning enabled generative sensing framework which integrates low-end sensors with computational intelligence to attain a high recognition accuracy on par with that attained with high-end sensors. The proposed generative sensing framework aims at transforming low-end, low-quality sensor data into higher quality sensor data in terms of achieved classification accuracy. The low-end data can be transformed into higher quality data of the same modality or into data of another modality. Different from existing methods for image generation, the proposed framework is based on discriminative models and targets to maximize the recognition accuracy rather than a similarity measure. This is achieved through the introduction of selective feature regeneration in a deep neural network (DNN). The proposed generative sensing will essentially transform low-quality sensor data into high-quality information for robust perception. Results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Random numbers play a vital role in cryptography, where they are used to generate keys, nonce, one-time pads, and initialization vectors for symmetric encryption. The quality of random number generator (RNG) has significant implications on vulnerability and performance of these algorithms. A pseudo-RNG uses a deterministic algorithm to produce numbers with a distribution very similar to uniform. True RNGs (TRNGs), on the other hand, use some natural phenomenon/process to generate random bits. They are nondeterministic, because the next number to be generated cannot be determined in advance. In this paper, a novel on-chip noise source, random telegraph noise (RTN), is exploited for simple and reliable TRNG. RTN, a microscopic process of stochastic trapping/detrapping of charges, is usually considered as a noise and mitigated in design. Through physical modeling and silicon measurement, we demonstrate that RTN is appropriate for TRNG, especially in highly scaled MOSFETs. Due to the slow speed of RTN, we purpose the system for on-chip seed generation for random number. Our contributions are: 1) physical model calibration of RTN with comprehensive 65- and 180-nm transistor measurements; 2) the scaling trend of RTN, validated with silicon data down to 28 nm; 3) design principles to achieve 50% signal probability by using intrinsic RTN physical properties, without traditional postprocessing algorithms, the generated sequence passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests; and 4) solutions to manage realistic issues in practice, including multilevel RTN signal, robustness to voltage and temperature fluctuations and the operation speed.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, temporal data is generated at an unprecedentedspeed from a variety of applications, such as wearable devices, sensor networks, wireless networks, etc. In contrast to suchlarge amount of temporal data, it is usually the case that onlya small portion of them contains information of interest. Forexample, for the ECG signals collected by wearable devices, most of them collected from healthy people are normal, andonly a small number of them collected from people with certain heart diseases are abnormal. Furthermore, even forthe abnormal temporal sequences, the abnormal patterns mayonly be present in a few time segments and are similar amongthemselves, forming a rare category of temporal patterns. Forexample, the ECG signal collected from an individual with acertain heart disease may be normal in most time segments, and abnormal in only a few time segments, exhibiting similarpatterns. What is even more challenging is that such raretemporal patterns are often non-separable from the normalones. Existing works on outlier detection for temporal datafocus on detecting either the abnormal sequences as a whole, orthe abnormal time segments directly, ignoring the relationshipbetween abnormal sequences and abnormal time segments.Moreover, the abnormal patterns are typically treated asisolated outliers instead of a rare category with self-similarity. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a bi-level(sequence-level/ segment-level) model for rare temporal patterndetection. It is based on an optimization frameworkthat fully exploits the bi-level structure in the data, i.e., therelationship between abnormal sequences and abnormal timesegments. Furthermore, it uses sequence-specific simple hiddenMarkov models to obtain segment-level labels, and leverages the similarity among abnormal time segments to estimate the model parameters. To solve the optimization framework, we propose the unsupervised algorithm BIRAD, and also thesemi-supervised version BIRAD-K which learns from a single labeled example. Experimental results on both synthetic andreal data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposedalgorithms from multiple aspects, outperforming state-of-the-arttechniques on both temporal outlier detection and rarecategory analysis.",

        "abstract": "The degradation of IC reliability is usually a gradual process. However, under some specific circumstance, the degradation rate can be dramatically accelerated, leading to a destructive result. Bias runaway, referring to the rapid increase of the bias voltage in analog/mixed signal (AMS) circuits, is such a case. It occurs when the feedback between the bias current and the effect of channel hot carrier (CHC) turns into positive and thus, uncontrollable. Such a catastrophic phenomenon is highly sensitive to the initial operation condition, as well as transistor gate length. Based on 65nm silicon data, this paper (1) investigates the critical condition that triggers bias runaway, and the impact of gate length tuning, (2) develops compact models and the simulation methodology for circuit diagnosis, and (3) proposes design solutions and the trade-offs to avoid bias runaway. Overall, this work identifies a key issue to the stability of bias generation circuits, which is vitally important to reliable AMS designs.",

The design of its two essential operations, read and write, is inspired by the biophysical behavior of a neural system, such as integrate-and-fire and local synapse weight update. The proposed hardware consists of an array with resistive random access memory (RRAM) and CMOS peripheral circuits, which perform matrix-vector multiplication and dictionary update in a fully parallel fashion, at the speed that is independent of the matrix dimension. The read and write circuits are implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology and verified together with an array of RRAM device model built from experimental data. The overall system exploits array-level parallelism and is demonstrated for accelerated dictionary learning tasks. As compared to software implementation running on a 8-core CPU, the proposed hardware achieves more than 3000 speedup, enabling high-speed feature extraction on a single chip.",

        "abstract": "Resistive RAM (ReRAM) has fast access time, ultra-low stand-by power and high reliability, making it a viable memory technology to replace DRAM in main memory. The 1-transistor-1-resistor (1T1R) ReRAM array has density comparable to that of a DRAM array and the advantages of lower programming energy and higher reliability compared to the ReRAM cross-point array. However, 1T1R ReRAM array has significantly lower lifetime compared to a DRAM array. In this paper, we show how cross-layer techniques can be used to improve reliability of 1T1R array with minimum latency and energy cost. At the circuit level, we show how voltage settings (pulse amplitude and pulse width) of word-line (WL), bit-line (BL), and source-line (SL) can be used to lower latency, lower energy consumption and improve reliability. We also show how appropriate choice of voltage settings can help reduce retention and endurance errors while minimizing energy. At the architecture level, we propose a new bit-flipping scheme that helps reduce the Bit Error Rate (BER) even further. We show how application of circuit-level and architecture-level techniques makes it possible to achieve a lifetime of 10 years with a simple BCH   $(t=2)$   code. Finally, we evaluate the system-level performances of a 1GB ReRAM and 1GB DRAM memory system using CACTI and GEM5. Simulation results using SPEC CPU INT 2006 and DaCapo-9.12 benchmarks show that the proposed ReRAM based main memory can improve Instruction Per Cycle (IPC) by 5.2% and energy by up to 72% compared to a DRAM memory system.",

        "abstract": "Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) have to be highly reliable especially when it is being used along with cryptographic hash modules for key generation. To achieve ultrahigh reliability, the conventional approach employs error correction codes (ECC) based on helper data input. Such an approach not only increases the hardware overhead of the PUF but also reduces the entropy of the system, resulting in both hardware and software security issues. In this paper we design a compact and highly reliable PUF architecture based on resistive random access memory (RRAM). We propose a new design where the sum of the read-out currents of multiple RRAM cells is used for generating one response bit. This method statistically minimizes any early-lifetime failure due to RRAM retention degradation at high temperature or under voltage stress. We employ a device model that is calibrated with IMEC HfOx RRAM experimental data and show that with 8 cells per bit, we can ensure  99.9999% reliability) for a lifetime u003e10 years at 125\u00b0C. We embed the RRAM PUF into SHA-256 and show that the hardware overhead of the proposed RRAM PUF based architecture is significantly lower than one that uses a traditional RRAM PUF with ECC.",

        "abstract": "The phenomenon of metal-insulator-transition (MIT) in strongly correlated oxides, such as NbO2, have shown the oscillation behavior in recent experiments. In this work, the MIT based two-terminal device is proposed as a compact oscillation neuron for the parallel read operation from the resistive synaptic array. The weighted sum is represented by the frequency of the oscillation neuron. Compared to the complex CMOS integrate-and-fire neuron with tens of transistors, the oscillation neuron achieves significant area reduction, thereby alleviating the column pitch matching problem of the peripheral circuitry in resistive memories. Firstly, the impact of MIT device characteristics on the weighted sum accuracy is investigated when the oscillation neuron is connected to a single resistive synaptic device. Secondly, the array-level performance is explored when the oscillation neurons are connected to the resistive synaptic array. To address the interference of oscillation between columns in simple cross-point arrays, a 2-transistor-1-resistor (2T1R) array architecture is proposed at negligible increase in array area. Finally, the circuit-level benchmark of the proposed oscillation neuron with the CMOS neuron is performed. At single neuron node level, oscillation neuron shows >12.5X reduction of area. At 128\u00d7128 array level, oscillation neuron shows a reduction of \u02dc4% total area, >30% latency, \u02dc5X energy and \u02dc40X leakage power, demonstrating its advantage of being integrated into the resistive synaptic array for neuro-inspired computing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Neuro-inspired computing has made significant progress in recent years. However, its computation efficiency and hardware cost still lag behind the biological nervous system, especially during the training stage. This work targets to understand this gap from a neural motif perspective, particularly the feedforward inhibitory motif. Such a motif has been found in many cortical systems, presenting a vital role in sparse learning. This work first establishes a neural network model that emulates the insectu0027s olfactory system, and then systematically studies various effects of the feedforward inhibitory motif. The performance and efficiency of the neural network models are evaluated through the handwritten digits recognition task, with and without the feedforward inhibitory motif. As demonstrated in the results, the utilization of the feedforward inhibitory motif is able to reduce the network size by u003e\u00a03X at the same accuracy of 95% in handwritten digits recognition. Further simulation experiments reveal that the feedforward inhibition not only dynamically regulates the firing rate of excitatory neurons, promotes and stabilizes the sparsity, but also provides a coarse categorization of the inputs, which improves the final accuracy with a smaller, cascade structure. These results differentiate the feedforward inhibition path from previous understanding of the feedback inhibition, illustrating its functional importance for high computation and structure efficiency.",

Inspired by micro neural-circuits in the cortical system, this work develops a novel solution that efficiently reduces the network size and improves the learning accuracy. The building block is the motif of feedforward inhibition that effectively separates main features and the residual in sparse feature extraction. Other learning rules follow the spike-rate-dependent-plasticity (SRDP). As demonstrated in handwriting recognition, such a bio-plausible solution is able to achieve u003e95% accuracy, comparable to the sparse coding algorithms; in addition, SRDP, instead of gradient based back propagation, is able to save the computation time by u003e50X.

        "abstract": "Resistive RAM (ReRAM) has fast access time, ultra-low stand-by power and high reliability, making it a viable memory technology to replace DRAM for main memory. The 1-transistor-1-resistor (1T1R) ReRAM array has density comparable to that of a DRAM array and the advantages of lower programming energy and higher reliability compared to the ultrahigh density ReRAM cross-point array. In this paper, we show how circuit operation parameters, such as the pulse amplitude and pulse widths of word-line (WL) voltage, bit-line (BL) voltage, and source-line (SL) voltage can be used to lower latency, lower power and improve reliability. SPICE simulation results demonstrate that appropriate choice of voltage settings can be used to reduce the write latency of the 1T1R cell by 29.4% and reduce write energy by 46.7% over the DRAM cell. Next, we show how the endurance of ReRAM cell can be improved by increasing the ratio between OFF and ON resistances and reducing SL voltage. We find that of these, reducing the SL voltage results in significant improvement in endurance with smaller energy overhead. Next, we evaluate the system-level performance of a 1GB ReRAM and DRAM memory system using CACTI and GEM5. Simulation results using SPEC CPU INT 2006 and DaCapo-9.12 benchmarks show that the ReRAM based main memory can improve IPC by 4.2% and energy by up to 77.8% compared to a DRAM system.",

        "abstract": "The cross-point array architecture with resistive synaptic devices has been proposed for on-chip implementation of weighted sum and weight update in the training process of learning algorithms. However, the non-ideal properties of the synaptic devices available today, such as the nonlinearity in weight update, limited ON/OFF range and device variations, can potentially hamper the learning accuracy. This paper focuses on the impact of these realistic properties on the learning accuracy and proposes the mitigation strategies. Unsupervised sparse coding is selected as a case study algorithm. With the calibration of the realistic synaptic behavior from the measured experimental data, our study shows that the recognition accuracy of MNIST handwriting digits degrades from ~97 % to ~65 %. To mitigate this accuracy loss, the proposed strategies include 1) the smart programming schemes for achieving linear weight update; 2) a dummy column to eliminate the off-state current; 3) the use of multiple cells for each weight element to alleviate the impact of device variations. With the improved synaptic behavior by these strategies, the accuracy increases back to ~95 %, enabling the reliable integration of realistic synaptic devices in the neuromorphic systems.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Despite its popularity, deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a portable system is still challenging due to large data volume, intensive computation and frequent memory access. Although previous FPGA acceleration schemes generated by high-level synthesis tools (i.e., HLS, OpenCL) have allowed for fast design optimization, hardware inefficiency still exists when allocating FPGA resources to maximize parallelism and throughput. A direct hardware-level design (i.e., RTL) can improve the efficiency and achieve greater acceleration. However, this requires an in-depth understanding of both the algorithm structure and the FPGA system architecture. In this work, we present a scalable solution that integrates the flexibility of high-level synthesis and the finer level optimization of an RTL implementation. The cornerstone is a compiler that analyzes the CNN structure and parameters, and automatically generates a set of modular and scalable computing primitives that can accelerate various deep learning algorithms. Integrating these modules together for end-to-end CNN implementations, this work quantitatively analyzes the complieru0027s design strategy to optimize the throughput of a given CNN model with the FPGA resource constraints. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on Altera Stratix-V GXA7 FPGA for AlexNet and NIN CNN models, achieving 114.5 GOPS and 117.3 GOPS, respectively. This represents a 1.9\u00d7 improvement in throughput when compared to the OpenCL-based design.

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are rapidly evolving and being applied to a broad range of applications. Given a specific application, an increasing challenge is to search the appropriate CNN algorithm and efficiently map it to the target hardware. The FPGA-based accelerator has the advantage of reconfigurability and flexibility, and has achieved high-performance and low-power. Without a general compiler to automate the implementation, however, significant efforts and expertise are still required to customize the design for each CNN model. In this work, we present an RTL-level CNN compiler that automatically generates customized FPGA hardware for the inference tasks of various CNNs, in order to enable high-level fast prototyping of CNNs from software to FPGA and still keep the benefits of low-level hardware optimization. First, a general-purpose library of RTL modules is developed to model different operations at each layer. The implementation of each module is optimized at the RTL level. Given a CNN algorithm, its structure is abstracted to a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then complied with RTL modules in the library. The integration and dataflow of physical modules are predefined in the top-level system template and reconfigured during compilation. The runtime control of layer-by-layer sequential computation is managed by the proposed execution schedule so that even highly irregular and complex network topology, e.g. ResNet, can be compiled. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with end-to-end FPGA implementations of various CNN algorithms (e.g. NiN, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ResNet-152) on two standalone Intel FPGAs, Stratix V and Arria 10. The performance and overhead of the automated compilation are evaluated. The compiled FPGA accelerators exhibit superior performance compared to state-of-the-art automation-based works by u003e2\u00d7 for various CNNs.",

This is especially important to reduce communication data for mobile medical applications. However, reconstructing the signal from CS is usually left off-line due to the complex computations. In this paper, we integrate two key technologies to enable on-line energy-efficient CS signal reconstruction. These are (1) the use of Bayesian CS Belief Propagation (CS-BP) as the algorithm basis and (2) the novel design of stochastic computing (SC) circuits to efficiently map CS-BP algorithm. The overall signal reconstruction system is implemented with digital SC circuits in 65nm CMOS and recovers compressively sensed electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) signals with 11X to 8X data compression factor. Compared to a conventional binary design, post-layout simulation results show that the proposed stochastic design performs reconstruction with 5X energy-delay product improvement and 2X area reduction.",

        "abstract": "As convolution layers contribute most operations in convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, an effective convolution acceleration scheme significantly affects the efficiency and performance of a hardware CNN accelerator. Convolution in CNNs involves three-dimensional multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations with four levels of loops, which results in a large design space. Prior works either employ limited loop optimization techniques, e.g. loop unrolling, tiling and interchange, or only tune some of the design variables after the accelerator architecture and dataflow are already fixed. Without fully studying the convolution loop optimization before the hardware design phase, the resulting accelerator can hardly exploit the data reuse and manage data movement efficiently. This work overcomes these barriers by quantitatively analyzing and optimizing the design objectives (e.g. required memory access) of the CNN accelerator based on multiple design variables. We systematically explore the trade-offs of hardware cost by searching the design variable configurations, and propose a specific dataflow of hardware CNN acceleration to minimize the memory access and data movement while maximizing the resource utilization to achieve high performance. The proposed CNN acceleration scheme and architecture are demonstrated on a standalone Altera Arria 10 GX 1150 FPGA by implementing end-to-end VGG-16 CNN model and achieved 645.25 GOPS of throughput and 47.97 ms of latency, which is a >3.2\u00d7 enhancement compared to state-of-the-art FPGA implementations of VGG model.",

Integrating these modules together for end-to-end CNN implementations, this work quantitatively analyzes the complieru0027s design strategy to optimize the throughput of a given CNN model under the FPGA resource constraints. The proposed RTL compiler, named ALAMO, is demonstrated on Altera Stratix-V GXA7 FPGA for the inference tasks of AlexNet and NiN CNN models, achieving 114.5 GOPS and 117.3 GOPS, respectively. This represents a 1.9 X  improvement in throughput when compared to the OpenCL-based design. The results illustrate the promise of the automatic compiler solution for modularized and scalable hardware acceleration of deep learning.",

        "abstract": "As convolution contributes most operations in convolutional neural network (CNN), the convolution acceleration scheme significantly affects the efficiency and performance of a hardware CNN accelerator. Convolution involves multiply and accumulate operations with four levels of loops, which results in a large design space. Prior works either employ limited loop optimization techniques, e.g., loop unrolling, tiling, and interchange, or only tune some of the design variables after the accelerator architecture and dataflow are already fixed. Without fully studying the convolution loop optimization before the hardware design phase, the resulting accelerator can hardly exploit the data reuse and manage data movement efficiently. This paper overcomes these barriers by quantitatively analyzing and optimizing the design objectives (e.g., memory access) of the CNN accelerator based on multiple design variables. Then, we propose a specific dataflow of hardware CNN acceleration to minimize the data communication while maximizing the resource utilization to achieve high performance. The proposed CNN acceleration scheme and architecture are demonstrated by implementing end-to-end CNNs including NiN, VGG-16, and ResNet-50/ResNet-152 for inference. For VGG-16 CNN, the overall throughputs achieve 348 GOPS and 715 GOPS on Intel Stratix V and Arria 10 FPGAs, respectively.",

Therefore, this work proposes to customize the detection algorithm, e.g. SSD, to benefit its hardware implementation with low data precision at the cost of marginal accuracy degradation.

        "abstract": "A broad range of applications are increasingly benefiting from the rapid and flourishing development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The FPGA-based CNN inference accelerator is gaining popularity due to its high-performance and low-power as well as FPGA\u2019s conventional advantage of reconfigurability and flexibility. Without a general compiler to automate the implementation, however, significant efforts and expertise are still required to customize the design for each CNN model. In this work, we present an RTL-level CNN compiler that automatically generates customized FPGA hardware for the inference tasks of various CNNs, in order to enable high-level fast prototyping of CNNs from software to FPGA and still keep the benefits of low-level hardware optimization. First, a general-purpose library of RTL modules is developed to model different operations at each layer. The integration and dataflow of physical modules are predefined in the top-level system template and reconfigured during compilation for a given CNN algorithm. The runtime control of layer-by-layer sequential computation is managed by the proposed execution schedule so that even highly irregular and complex network topology, e.g. GoogLeNet and ResNet, can be compiled. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with various CNN algorithms, e.g. NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet and ResNet, on two standalone Intel FPGAs, Arria 10 and Stratix 10, achieving end-to-end inference throughputs of 969 GOPS and 1,604 GOPS, respectively, with batch size of one.",

To achieve high performance and energy efficiency, an FPGA-based accelerator must fully utilize the limited computation resources and minimize the data communication and memory access, both of which are impacted and constrained by a variety of design parameters, e.g. the degree and dimension of parallelism, the size of on-chip buffers, the bandwidth of the external memory, and many more. The large design space of the accelerator makes it impractical to search for the optimal design in the implementation phase. To address this problem, a performance model is described to estimate the performance and resource utilization of an FPGA implementation. By this means, the performance bottleneck and design bound can be identified and the optimal design option can be explored early in the design phase. The proposed performance model is validated using a variety of CNN algorithms comparing the results with on-board test results on two different FPGAs.",

        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on hardware is facing excessive computation cost due to the massive number of parameters. A typical training pipeline to mitigate over-parameterization is to pre-define a DNN structure with redundant learning units (filters and neurons) with the goal of high accuracy, then to prune redundant learning units after training with the purpose of efficient inference. We argue that it is sub-optimal to introduce redundancy into training in order to reduce redundancy later in inference. Moreover, the fixed network structure further results in poor adaption to dynamic tasks, such as lifelong learning. In contrast, structural plasticity plays an indispensable role in mammalian brains to achieve compact and accurate learning. Throughout the lifetime, active connections are continuously created while those that are no longer important are degenerated. Inspired by such observation, we propose a training scheme, namely Continuous Growth and Pruning (CGaP), where we start the training from a small network seed, then literally execute continuous growth by adding important learning units and finally prune secondary ones for efficient inference. The inference model generated from CGaP is sparse in the structure, largely decreasing the inference power and latency when deployed on hardware platforms. With popular DNN structures on representative datasets, the efficacy of CGaP is benchmarked by both algorithmic simulation and architectural modeling on Field-programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). For example, CGaP decreases the FLOPs, model size, DRAM access energy and inference latency by 63.3%, 64.0%, 11.8% and 40.2%, respectively, for ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10.",

Our study encompasses the influence of key parameters in DNN hardware implementations towards energy efficiency, including DNN architectural choices, underlying workloads, and tier partitioning choices in M3D.

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has become widespread for various real-world recognition tasks. In addition to recognition accuracy, energy efficiency and speed (i.e., performance) are other grand challenges to enable local intelligence in edge devices. In this article, we investigate the adoption of monolithic three-dimensional (3D) IC (M3D) technology for deep learning hardware design, using speech recognition as a test vehicle. M3D has recently proven to be one of the leading contenders to address the power, performance, and area (PPA) scaling challenges in advanced technology nodes. Our study encompasses the influence of key parameters in DNN hardware implementations towards their performance and energy efficiency, including DNN architectural choices, underlying workloads, and tier partitioning choices in M3D designs. Our post-layout M3D designs, together with hardware-efficient sparse algorithms, produce power savings and performance improvement beyond what can be achieved using conventional 2D ICs. Experimental results show that M3D offers 22.3% iso-performance power saving and 6.2% performance improvement, convincingly demonstrating its entitlement as a solution for DNN ASICs. We further present architectural and physical design guidelines for M3D DNNs to maximize the benefits.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Many wearable devices employ the sensors for physiological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram or ECG) to continuously monitor personal health (e.g., cardiac monitoring). Considering private medical data storage, secure access to such wearable devices becomes a crucial necessity. Exploiting the ECG sensors present on wearable devices, we investigate the possibility of using ECG as the individually unique source for device authentication. In particular, we propose to use ECG features toward both cardiac monitoring and neural-network-based biometric authentication. For such complex functionalities to be seamlessly integrated in wearable devices, an accurate algorithm must be implemented with ultralow power and a small form factor. In this paper, a smart ECG processor is presented for ECG-based authentication as well as cardiac monitoring. Data-driven Lasso regression and low-precision techniques are developed to compress neural networks for feature extraction by 24.4\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n.

        "title": "A Low Cost Multi-Tiered Approach to Improving the Reliability of Multi-Level Cell Pram",
        "abstract": "Phase change RAM (PRAM) is a promising memory technology because of its fast read access time, very low standby power and high storage density. Multi-level Cell (MLC) PRAM, which has been introduced to further improve the storage density, comes at a price of lower reliability. This paper focuses on a cost-effective solution for improving the reliability of MLC-PRAM. As a first step, we study in detail the causes of hard and soft errors and develop error models to capture these effects. Next we propose a multi-tiered approach that spans architecture, circuit and system levels to increase the reliability. At the architecture level, we use a combination of Gray code encoding and 2-bit interleaving to partition the errors so that a lower strength error control coding (ECC) scheme can be used for half of the bits. We use subblock flipping and threshold resistance tuning to reduce the number of errors in the remaining bits. For even higher reliability, we use a simple BCH based ECC on top of these techniques. We show that the proposed multi-tiered approach enables us to use ECC with 2-error correction capability (t\u00bf=\u00bf2) instead of one with t\u00bf=\u00bf8 to achieve a block failure rate (BFR) of 10\u00bf8. We propose to use a non-iterative algorithm to implement the BCH t\u00bf=\u00bf2 decoder because of its small latency. We evaluate the latency and energy overhead of the proposed scheme using CACTI and the IPC performance using GEM5. We show that for SPEC CINT 2006 and DaCapo benchmarks, the proposed system can achieve BFR = 10\u00bf8 with 2.2 % IPC reduction and 7 % additional energy compared to a memory without any error correction capability.",

Each scene is part of a story. Browsing these scenes unfolds the entire story of a film. In this paper, we first investigate recent scene segmentation techniques that belong to the visual-audio alignment approach. This approach segments a video stream into visual scenes and an audio stream into audio scenes separately and later aligns these boundaries to create the final scene boundaries. In contrast, we propose a novel audio-assisted scene segmentation technique that utilizes audio information to remove false boundaries generated from segmentation by visual information alone. The crux of our technique is the new dissimilarity measure based on analysis of statistical properties of audio features and a concept in information theory. The experimental results on two full-length films with a wide range of camera motion and a complex composition of shots demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique compared with that of the visual-audio alignment techniques.",

        "abstract": "Colonoscopy is an important screening tool for colorectal cancer. During a colonoscopic procedure, a tiny video camera at the tip of the endoscope generates a video signal of the internal mucosa of the colon. The video data are displayed on a monitor for real-time analysis by the endoscopist. We call videos captured from colonoscopic procedures colonoscopy videos. Because these videos possess unique characteristics, new types of semantic units and parsing techniques are required. In this paper, we define new semantic units called operation shots, each is a segment of visual and audio data that correspond to a therapeutic or biopsy operation. We introduce a new spatio-temporal analysis technique to detect operation shots. Our experiments on colonoscopy videos demonstrate that the technique does not miss any meaningful operation shots and incurs a small number of false operation shots. Our prototype parsing software implements the operation shot detection technique along with our other techniques previously developed for colonoscopy videos. Our browsing tool enables users to quickly locate operation shots of interest. The proposed technique and software are useful (1) for post-procedure reviews and analyses for causes of complications due to biopsy or therapeutic operations, (2) for developing an effective content-based retrieval system for colonoscopy videos to facilitate endoscopic research and education, and (3) for development of a systematic approach to assess endoscopists' procedural skills.",

        "abstract": "Advances in video technology are being incorporated into today's healthcare practices. Colonoscopy is regarded as one of the most important diagnostic tools for colorectal cancer. Indeed, colonoscopy has contributed to a decline in the number of colorectal-cancer-related deaths. Although colonoscopy has become the preferred screening modality for prevention of colorectal cancer, recent data suggest that there is a significant miss rate for the detection of large polyps and cancers, and methods to investigate why this occurs are needed. To address this problem, we present a new computer-based method that analyzes a digitized video file of a colonoscopic procedure and produces a number of metrics that likely reflect the quality of the procedure. The method consists of a set of novel image-processing algorithms designed to address new technical challenges due to uncommon characteristics of videos captured during colonoscopy. As these measurements can be obtained automatically, our method enables future quality control in large-scale day-to-day medical practice, which is currently not feasible. In addition, our method can be adapted to other endoscopic procedures such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, enteroscopy, and bronchoscopy. Last but not least, our method may be useful to assess progress during colonoscopy training.",

In this paper, we present an approach to annotation of a video database using a domain specific ontology, a domain independent video ontology that encodes the structure and attributes of video data. The two ontologies are integrated using domain-specific semantic linkage. The result, an integrated ontology for video annotation (IOVA) is represented in OWL, a description logic based ontology language. We describe a user-friendly platform for video database annotation (VIDAI) using IOVA. We demonstrate the use of IOVA and VIDAI in annotating a database of colonoscopy videos. Video entities are annotated with a combination of domain-independent features and the domain-specific entities. Annotation of video data using IOVA constitutes an important first step towards flexible and fully automated indexing, retrieval, inference, and data-driven knowledge discovery using video data in a broad range of applications including colonoscopy video analysis.",

        "abstract": "Colonoscopy is an important screening tool for colorectal cancer. During a colonoscopic procedure, a tiny video camera at the tip of the endoscope generates a video signal of the internal mucosa of the colon. The video data are displayed on a monitor for real-time analysis by the endoscopist. We call videos captured from colonoscopic procedures \"colonoscopy videos\". To the best of our knowledge, they are not captured for post procedural review or analysis in the current practice. Because of the unique characteristics of colonoscopy videos, new types of semantic units and new image/video analyzing techniques are required. In this dissertation, we aim to develop new image/video analysis techniques for these videos to extract important semantic units, such as colonoscopic scenes, operation shots, and appendix images. Our contributions include two parts: (a) new definitions of semantic units (colonoscopic scene, operation shot, and appendix image); and (b) novel image/video analysis algorithms, including novel scene segmentation algorithms using audio and visual information to recognize scene boundaries, new computer-aided detection approaches for operation shot detection, and new image analysis methods for appendix image classification. The new image processing and content-based video analysis algorithms can be extended to videos from other endoscopic procedures, such as upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, EGD, enteroscopy, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, and laparoscopy. Our research is very useful for the following platforms and resources: (a) platforms for new methods to discover unknown patterns of diseases and cancers; (b) platforms for improving and assessing endoscopists procedural skills; and (c) education resources for endoscopic research.",

During a colonoscopic procedure, a tiny video camera at the tip of the endoscope generates a video signal of the internal mucosa of the colon. In current practice, the entire colonoscopic procedure is not routinely captured. Software tools providing easy access to important contents of videos that are digitally captured during colonoscopy are not available. Hence, it is very time consuming to review an entire video, locate important contents, annotate them, and extract the annotated contents for research, teaching, and training purposes. Arthemis, a software application, was developed to facilitate this process. For convenient data sharing, Arthemis allows annotation according to the European Gastrointestinal Society for Endoscopy (ESGE) Minimal Standard Terminology (MST), an internationally accepted standard for digestive endoscopy. Arthemis is part of our integrated capturing and content analysis system for colonoscopy called Endoscopic Multimedia Information System (EMIS). This paper presents Arthemis as a component of EMIS, the design and implementation of Arthemis, and key lessons learned from the development process.",

Colonoscopy is the accepted screening method for detection of colorectal cancer or its precursor lesions, colorectal polyps.

Currently, there is no objective way to measure in detail what exactly is achieved during the procedure (i.e., quality of the colonoscopic procedure). In this paper, we present new algorithms that analyze a video file created during colonoscopy and derive quality measurements of how the colon mucosa is inspected. The proposed algorithms are unique applications of existing data mining techniques: decision tree and support vector machine classifiers applied to videos from medical domain. The algorithms are to be integrated into a novel system aimed at automatic analysis for quality measures of colonoscopy.",

Indeed, colonoscopy has contributed to a decline in the number of colorectal cancer related deaths. However, not all cancers or large polyps are detected at the time of colonoscopy, and methods to investigate why this occurs are needed. We present a new computer-based method that allows automated measurement of a number of metrics that likely reflect the quality of the colonoscopic procedure. The method is based on analysis of a digitized video file created during colonoscopy, and produces information regarding insertion time, withdrawal time, images at the time of maximal intubation, the time and ratio of clear versus blurred or non-informative images, and a first estimate of effort performed by the endoscopist. As these metrics can be obtained automatically, our method allows future quality control in the day-to-day medical practice setting on a large scale. In addition, our method can be adapted to other healthcare procedures. Last but not least, our method may be useful to assess progress during colonoscopy training, or as part of endoscopic skills assessment evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Colonoscopy is an endoscopic technique that allows a physician to inspect the inside of the human colon and to perform--if deemed necessary-at the same time a number of diagnostic and therapeutic operations. In order to see the inside of the colon, a video signal of the internal mucosa of the colon is generated by a tiny video camera at the tip of the endoscope and displayed on a monitor for real-time analysis by the physician. We have captured and stored these videos in digital format and call these colonoscopy videos. Based on new algorithms for instrument detection and shot segmentation, we introduce new spatio-temporal analysis techniques to automatically identify an operation shot--a segment of visual data in a colonoscopy video that corresponds to a diagnostic or therapeutic operation. Our experiments on real colonoscopy videos demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed techniques and software are useful for 1) postprocedure review for causes of complications due to diagnostic or therapeutic operations; 2) establishment of an effective content-based retrieval system to facilitate endoscopic research and education; 3) development of a systematic approach to assess and improve the procedural skills of endoscopists.",

Method: The suspension cells were obtained, through tissue culture by manipulation of inoculum, various media, pH value, and illumination conditions. The contents of ginsenosides Re and Rb1 were determined by HPLC, while the contents of polysaccharide were determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Result: The growth rate of suspension cells was greatly increased when inoculum amount was 25 g-L-1. The effect of media MS, SH and B5 on suspension cells was observed. MS medium was favorable for cells growth, while B5 medium was favorable for the synthesis of ginsenosides and polysaccharides. The polysaccharide content in three media were higher than that of the cultivations. The pH value showed little influence on the cells growth, medium pH 6.0 enhanced the synthesis of Re and polysaccharides. Illumination could significantly enhance secondary metabolite biosynthesis of suspension cells and promoted slightly in polysaccharide synthesis. Conclusion: The inoculum, various media, pH value of medium and illumination conditions have significant influences on suspension cells growth of P. quinquefolium, secondary metabolite and polysaccharides synthesis.",

Methods: One hundred and sixty-two patients were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent coronary angiography. They were divided into 3 groups: ACS group (n = 54), SAP group (n = 54) and control group (n = 54). Blood samples were taken from the artery before angiography in all patients and the concentrations of MPO, hsCRP and cTnI were measured. Each subject was asked details of history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and smoking habits. The efficacy of therapy, the cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, the need for revascularization, or death) were recorded after 6 months of follow-up. Results: The plasma MPO level in ACS group (30.98 ng/mL) was significantly higher than those in the SAP group (14. 67 ng/mL) and the control group (14.23 ng/mL) (P < 0.01), and the plasma MPO levels in patients of the SAP group and the control group were not significantly different (P = 0.74). There was no obvious correlation between the levels of plasma MPO and the serum levels of cTnI, hsCRP, the prevalence of the 4 major risk factors for CHD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that plasma MPO level, free plasma glucose and sex were the significant variables. The risk for subsequent cardiovascular events was higher in the patients with elevated level of MPO. Conclusion: Plasma MPO may be a new risk biomarker for ACS and may predict the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effects of immune complexes (IC) prepared from human oxidized density lipoprotein (oxLDL) antibodies and human oxLDL on the foam cell forming and the macrophage activation, and to further uncover the possible mechanisms of immune complexes contributing to the atherosclerosis occurrence.The immune complexes of human oxLDL and purified human oxLDL antibodies were added to culture U937 cells by protocols: polyethylene glycol-precipitated insoluble IC (PEG-IC) and IC immobilized by absorption to red blood cells (RBC-IC). With oxLDL as controls and heat-aggregated gamma globulin as an inhibitor of Fc gamma receptor, we measured the cholesterol ester, total cholesterol of the cellular extracts, and quantified the secreted MMP-1 of supernatants from U937 cells.A significant increase of MMP-1 release [(0.769 +/- 0.030) ng/ml vs (0.513 +/- 0.034) ng/ml, P < 0.01] and a higher level of cholesterol ester accumulation [(20.271 +/- 1.668) microg/mg protein vs (17. 226 +/- 1.298 ) microg/mg protein, P < 0.05] in U937 cells incubated with RBC-IC were observed, compared with those incubated with RBC-oxLDL. However, the above quantative difference between the cholesterol ester accumulation induced by oxLDL and insoluble PEG-IC was even more striking, and cholesterol ester accumulation was dosage-dependent. Heat-aggregated gamma globulin (10 mg/ml) as an inhibitor of Fc gamma receptors competitively inhibited cholesterol ester accumulation and decreased PEG-IC stimulating MMP-1 secretion to 71%.Immune complexe of ox-LDL can transform macrophages into foam cells and activted macrophages. The immunological function of oxLDL is involved in the process of atherosclerosis occurrence.",

Method:Six-two subjects were undergone coronary angiography and ultrasound detection of carotid and brachial artery. The severities of coronary stenosis and carotid atherosclerosis were determined by Gensini score and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), respectively. The flow mediated dilation (FMD) of brachial artery was also measured by color Doppler ultrasound. Based on the results of coronary angiography and carotid ultrasound, the subjects were classified into three groups: control (no AS), mild AS and severe AS groups. The plasma levels of Visfatin were measured. The correlation between Visfatin and carotid IMT, Gensini score were analyzed. Also, the relation between Visfatin and the FMD of brachial artery were investigated.Result:Plasma level of Visfatin was elevated in both mild and severe AS comparing with the control, and it increased more significantly in severe AS than that in mild AS. Moreover, plasma level of Visfatin was positively correlated with carotid IMT and Gensini whereas negatively correlated with the FMD of brachial artery.Conclusion:The plasma level of Visfatin is closely correlated with the genesis and development of AS and the endothelial function. It might be used as a clinical marker to predict the degree of AS and the status of endothelia function.",

Real-time 3-dimensional left atrial (LA) and pulmonary veins (PVs) maps were constructed through 3-dimensional mapping system (Ensite NavX) in all patients. Pulmonary vein isolation was performed by encircling the left and right sides of PVs at 1 to 2 cm away from the ostium of PVs. The endpoint of ablation included: All circum PVs ablation lines finished; all PVs were isolated; and non-inducibility of AF was observed.All 28 patients reached the endpoint of ablation completely. The mean procedure time and fluoroscopy time was (161.3+/-23.2) min and (38.0+/-6.8) min, respectively. During the 6 approximately 17 month follow-up, 20 patients (71%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Recurrence of AF was found in the other 8 patients (29%): Two were treated with amiodarone and 6 repeated ablation. After the second ablation, 4 were free of AF and 2 recurrence were treated with amiodarone. No complications occurred during the procedure and the follow-up.Linear ablation and circumferential isolation of pulmonary veins for atrial fibrillation (AF) guided by 3-dimensional mapping system is effective and safe.

Ascending aortic pressure was measured with physiology recorder during coronary angiography, and brachial blood pressure (BP) with a standard sphygmomanometer meantime. One hundred and one cases with mild or moderate essential hypertension received perindopril (4 mg/d, n=62), or metoprolol(25 mg/d, n=39) for > 2 weeks before the study. Results The ascending aortic SBP was 9.62 mm Hg higher than the brachial SBP (P<0.01); DBP was 1.96 mm Hg lower (P<0.01) in hypertensive patients. No significant difference (all P>0.05) in baseline BP between the perindopril and metoprolol groups was found. After treatment for 2 weeks, the brachial blood pressure were similiar in the two groups (P>0.05). However the ascending aortic SBP in perindopril group is markedly lower than that in metoprolol group (P<0.05). Conclusion Although both perindopril and metoprolol are similarly effective in reducing brachial arterial blood pressure, perindopril decreases central systolic pressure more significantly than metoprolol.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To monitor the changes of plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), nitric oxide (NO), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to evaluate the correlation between ADMA and different types of coronary heart disease. Methods: A total of 143 subjects were divided into a non-CHD group, a SAP group and an ACS group. Plasma levels of ADMA, NO and vWF were examined and their correlation with SAP or ACS was analyzed. Results: Compared with the non-CHO or the SAP group, ADMA level was elevated in the ACS group (P < 0.05). The ADMA level tended to increase in the SAP group compared with the non-CHD group, but had no significant difference (P > 0. 05). Compared with the non-CHD group, NO level was decreased in both the SAP and ACS group (P < 0.05), and it decreased more in ACS group than that in the SAP group (P > 0.05); vWF levels were increased in both the SAP and ACS group compared with the non-CHD group (P < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in the plasma levels of vWF in the SAP and the ACS group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The change of plasma ADMA level is closely correlated with acute coronary syndrome. ADMA might be a clinical marker for acute coronary syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), has become one of the most important agricultural pests worldwide, because of its extensive host range, reproductive capacity, invasion potential, plant viruses transmition ability and insecticide resistance. All of these interrelating factors are related to the basic life cycle and life history of the species, making western flower thrips the significant, difficult pest to manage. More than 500 kinds of host plants of western flower thrips have been reported. Notably, more and more serious damage to vegetables by F. occidentalis has been observed in recent years and the levels of damages were different with vegetable species. In order to know the differences and offer basis data for control, the life tables for experimental populations of F. occidentalis were established at constant temperature of 25 0C, relative humidity of 70% and photoperiod of 16L:8D, on cucumber, lettuce, eggplant, cabbage, celery and garlic leaves, respectively. The results showed that the thrip could develop and reproduce on all tested host plants, and there were significantly differences in the developmental periods, survival rates and fecundities on the 6 vegetable hosts. The shortest time for F. occidentalis to complete one generation was 11. 43 days on cucumber, and the longest was 16. 11 days on celery. The survival rates of F. occidentalis at different stages were different on different host plants. In short, the highest generation survival rates were on eggplant and garlic, and the lowest were on celery and cucumber. The fecundities per female per day were 2. 88 on cabbage and 2. 48 on lettuce, which were much bigger than those on other hosts, and the least was 0. 77 on garlic. From all the life history of F. occidentalis,the number of female offsping increased at beginning and then declined, with the obvious oviposition peaks varying with different hosts as time increased. The rates of F. occidentalis female offspring on cabbage 1. 9694 and lettuce 1. 7649 per female per day were significantly higher than on other host plants. In addition, the sex ratio of offspring was also the highest on the two hosts, 0.72 and 0.76, respectively. The innate capacity of increase (r m) of experimental population of F. occidentalis on cucumber, lettuce, eggplant, cabbage, celery and garlic was 0.1318, 0.1228, 0. 1154, 0. 1197, 0. 0860 and 0. 0791, respectively, and the net reproductive rate (R 0) was 19. 1248, 30. 8523, 17. 9322, 34. 5322, 8. 9491 and 8. 3536, respectively. There were no significant differences in the mean generation time (T), and the trend indexes of experimental population (I) of F. occidentalis were similar to R0. Based on the parameters of the life tables on different hosts, the most suitable host plants for the development and reproduction of F. occidentalis were cabbage and lettuce, followed by cucumber and eggplant, the least celery and garlic. It could be concluded that host was an important factor influencing the development and fecundity of F. occidentalis populations. A lot of studies pointed out that there were many factors influencing the feeding, growth, development and oviposition of insects, such as flower, nutritional status, secondary substances and so on. So much more work needed to do for further understanding the differences and mechanism of F. occidentalis on different hosts.",

        "title": "Selectivity of Frankliniella occidentalis to vegetable hosts",
        "abstract": "Western flower thrip, Frankliniella occidentalis, is one of the most serious pests in vegetable production worldwide. Its damage to crop production results from direct feeding as well as serving as a vector of plant viruses. F. occidentalis invaded China in 2003, and now has been reported in several provinces of the country. F. occidentalis is a polyphagous species with more than 500 plant species belonging to 62 different families. It is reported that there are significant differences at the selectivity of F. occidentalis on host plants. However, the selectivity of F. occidentalis has not yet been studied in China. In this paper, the host selectivity of F. occidentalis was studied through the field investigations, the indoor free choice tests, as well as the research on the effect of different vegetables on the development and fecundity of the insects. The field investigations showed that F. occidentalis could occur on 24 kinds of vegetables with quite various populations, indicating that F. occidentalis had obvious preference behaviors in host selection. The fitness of host plants to F. occidentalis was quantitatively measured with selective index (I) and preference index (P). The selective index was the biggest, the value of 1, for 9 vegetables, such as kidney bean, radish, cucumber, and eggplant, and the lowest selective index was 0.2 for celery. The preference indexes were different among host plants too, with the biggest value 0.8 for kidney bean, and lowest on water spinach. According to the indexes, the host plants of F. occidentalis may be categorized into 4 groups, (1) the most favorite hosts, such as kidney bean, eggplant, cucumber, radish and coriander; (2) favorite hosts, such as hyacinth bean, soybean, lettuce and sponge gourd; (3) secondary favorite hosts, including cowpea, broad bean, pepper and amaranth; and (4) non-favorite host, such as tomato, garlic and celery. There was an obvious linear relation between P and I, with the regression equation of P = 0.7937I-0.2734. The indoor free choice tests showed that the number of adults and eggs were greatly different on different vegetables under the coexistence of 7 vegetable hosts (cucumber, kidney bean, eggplant, lettuce, cabbage, celery and garlic), the greatest number of adults landing on the surface was found on cucumber, and the most eggs was laid on cucumber and kidney bean. Both of the number of adults landing and eggs laid were the lowest on celery and garlic. The developmental periods and survival rates of F. occidentalis were significantly different among the vegetables. F. occidentalis had the fastest development when feeding on cucumber, with immature stage of 11.43 d, and the slowest growth on celery with the immature stage of 16.1d. The experimental results indicated that there were significant differences of larval survival rates on several hosts ranging from 72.55% to 98.00%. It was found that the lowest survival rate of immature stage was 57.14% on celery. F. occidentalis could lay eggs in all the 7 kinds of vegetables, but there were significant differences in the number of eggs laid in each host. Each female deposited 0.45 eggs per day on garlic, 4.43 on kidney bean. In conclusion, the results in field and in door tests showed that F. occidentalis had obvious selectivity to vegetable hosts, and field investigation results in selectivity of F. occidentalis to vegetables were basically in accordance with those of indoor tests.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects 0.5-1% of the population worldwide. Current diagnostic methods are based on psychiatric interviews, which are subjective in nature. The lack of disease biomarkers to support objective laboratory tests has been a long-standing bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis and evaluation of schizophrenia. Here we report a global metabolic profiling study involving 112 schizophrenic patients and 110 healthy subjects, who were divided into a training set and a test set, designed to identify metabolite markers. A panel of serum markers consisting of glycerate, eicosenoic acid, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate and cystine was identified as an effective diagnostic tool, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.945 in the training samples (62 patients and 62 controls) and 0.895 in the test samples (50 patients and 48 controls). Furthermore, a composite panel by the addition of urine \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate to the serum panel achieved a more satisfactory accuracy, which reached an AUC of 1 in both the training set and the test set. Multiple fatty acids and ketone bodies were found significantly (P<0.01) elevated in both the serum and urine of patients, suggesting an upregulated fatty acid catabolism, presumably resulting from an insufficiency of glucose supply in the brains of schizophrenia patients.",

Although many classification tools, such as projection to latent structures (PLS), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF), have been successfully used in metabolomics, their performance including strengths and limitations in clinical data analysis has not been clear to researchers due to the lack of systematic evaluation of these tools. In this paper we comparatively evaluated the four classifiers, PLS, SVM, LDA, and RF, in the analysis of clinical metabolomic data derived from gas chromatography mass spectrometry platform of healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, where cross-validation, R (2)/Q (2) plot, receiver operating characteristic curve, variable reduction, and Pearson correlation were performed. RF outperforms the other three classifiers in the given clinical data sets, highlighting its comparative advantages as a suitable classification and biomarker selection tool for clinical metabolomic data analysis.",

The accuracy of these classifiers was tested by 7-fold and holdout Cross Validation. Their stability and over fitting were evaluated by holdout Cross Validation and permutation (repeated 100 times). Their prediction ability was investigated by ROC curve, and their sensitivity on irrelevant variables was studied by variable ranking combining selection step by step.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial chemicals, could disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and exhibit neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and embryotoxicity. However, clear evidence of embryotoxicity and neurotoxicity of many of these congeners, such as deca-BDE, one of the least bioactive congeners of PBDEs, is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated deca-BDE embryotoxicity by quantitative analysis of two essential thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) and a variety of small-molecule metabolites in the serum of deca-BDE-dosed pregnant mice. Four groups of pregnant C57 mice were administrated with deca-BDE in 20% fat emulsion at a dose of 150, 750, 1,500, or 2,500 mg/kg body weight via gastric intubation on gestation days (g.d.s) 7 to 9, while a control group was given 20% fat emulsion. Maternal mice were euthanized on g.d. 16 and examined for external malformations of the fetus. Maternal serum samples were collected and analyzed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS). Using multivariate statistical analysis, we observed a significantly altered metabolic profile associated with deca-BDE embryotoxicity in maternal serum. Our results also demonstrated that deca-BDE at a dose of 2\u2009500 mg/kg body weight induced significant disruption of thyroid hormone metabolism, the TCA cycle, and lipid metabolism in maternal mice, which subsequently led to a significant inhibition of fetal growth and development. We concluded that deca-BDE-induced embryotoxicity closely correlated with global metabolic disruption that can be characterized by thyroid hormone deficiency, disrupted lipid metabolism, and a depleted level of cholesterol in maternal mice.",

This extraordinarily low sheet resistance is a result of high carrier mobility and concentration (~ 1200 cm 2 /Vs and ~ 3.5x10 13 cm -2 at room temperature), which is ~ 3 x smaller than that of the conventional AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect transistor (HFET) structures. Using a 5 nm SiN x deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition as gate-dielectric, HFETs were fabricated using these all binary AlN/GaN heterostructures and the gate tunneling current was found to be efficiently suppressed. Output current densities of 1.7 A/mm and 2.1 A/mm, intrinsic transconductance of 455 mS/mm and 785 mS/mm, were achieved for 2 \u221dm and 250 nm gate-length devices, respectively. Current gain cut-off frequency f T of 3.5 GHz and 60 GHz were measured on 2 \u221dm and 250 nm gate-length devices, limited by the high ohmic contact resistance as well as the relatively long gate length in comparison to the electron mean free path under high electric fields.",

Multiple 2DEGs have been found in AlN/GaN superlattices, with the net electron density measured > 1 \u00d7 10 14 cm \u2212 2 at room temperature. This very high electron density also leads to a further lowering of sheet resistance to values far below what is achievable in single nitride heterojunctions. These low resistance channels are induced entirely by polarization in nominally undoped heterostructures, and are attractive for various device applications such as high speed transistors and intersubband detectors.

        "abstract": "luminescence spectroscopy. Finally, we find a strong corre- lation between the structural and transport properties of the as grown InN layers, and identify charged dislocation scat- tering as the dominant scattering mechanism. A Veeco Gen 930 MBE system with a Veeco UNI-Bulb rf plasma source configured for the growth of III-V nitrides was used for the growth of InN. Commercially available semi-insulating GaN-on sapphire templates were used in this work as the substrate. A two-step growth process was used: an thin InN buffer layer about 60 nm was grown at a low substrate temperature 360 \u00b0C, followed by an epitaxial InN layer at a higher substrate temperature 510 \u00b0C. During the growth, in situ RHEED was used to monitor the evolution of the surface morphology of the InN film. After the growth, the samples were examined under an optical microscope to de- termine if there were excess indium metal droplets on the sample surface; if present they were removed by HCl treat- ment. Four InN samples were grown at different indium fluxes Table I. Sample A was grown in the nitrogen-rich regime III/V ratio 1 and no metal droplets were observed on the surface after growth. Sample B was grown in a slightly In-rich regime and only a few In droplets were ob- served. Samples C and D were grown at higher indium flux and after growth there were In droplets left on the surface. Surface morphology of InN sample was characterized by AFM. The root-mean-square rms surface roughnesses of the four InN samples for a 22 m 2 scan are listed in Table I. All four samples were grown for 2 h with a total thickness of 710 nm.",

Compared with HEMTs with conventional alloyed ohmic contacts, HEMTs with non-alloyed contacts show a reduction of $10^{6}$ in leakage current, a steeper subthreshold slope, and >50% improvement in breakdown voltage.

Devices with 40-nm-long footprints show a maximum output current density of 1.8 A/mm, an extrinsic dc transconductance of 770 mS/mm, and cutoff frequencies fT/fmax of 230/300 GHz at the same bias, which give a record-high value of \u221afT \u00b7fmax = 263 GHz among all reported InAl(Ga)N barrier HEMTs. The device speed shows good scalability with gate length despite the onset of short-channel effects due to the lack of a back barrier. An effective electron velocity of 1.36 \u00d7107 cm/s, which is comparable with that in the state-of-the-art deeply scaled AlN/GaN HEMTs, has been extracted from the gate-length dependence of fT for gate lengths from 100 to 40 nm.",

A low specific ON-resistance RON,SP (5.12 mQ \u00b7 cm2), a low turn-ON voltage (<; 0.7 V), and a high reverse breakdown voltage (BV) (>1.9 kV) were simultaneously achieved in devices with a 25-\u03bcm anode/cathode distance, resulting in a power figure-of-merit BV2/RON,SP of 727 MW \u00b7 cm-2. The record high BV of 1.9 kV is attributed to the dual field-plate structure.",

        "abstract": "A technology similar to silicon-on-insulator is highly desirable for III-V electronics to support scaling for future generations. This letter reports the first realization of strained GaN quantum-well transistors embedded in unstrained AlN as the insulator. The molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown heterostructure consisting of an ultrathin GaN channel buried in strain-free AIN barriers is favorable for scaling by the suppression of short-channel effects. Ohmic contacts are realized with MBE-regrown heavily Si-doped n+ GaN. For long-channel devices, a saturation drain current of ~0.7 A/mm at VGS = +3 V and a peak extrinsic transconductance of ~160 mS/mm around VGS = +1 V are measured at VDS = +10 V. No hysteresis is observed in the C-V measurement, indicating the high quality of all binary nitride heterostructures. The demonstrated device structure offers a high promise for high-frequency and high-power applications in the future. The strain-free barrier has the potential to enhance the reliability of GaN transistors.",

        "abstract": "A series of sustained-release morphine sulfate suppositories were prepared with two kinds of different bases according the qualified formulations (r 2 > 0.9). The best formulation was determined by melting point, drug release in vitro and rectal administration in rabbits. A self-made device was used to evaluate drug release in vitro. The 3p97 program was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine sulfate suppositories. Comparative studies on characteristics in vitro release and in vivo pharmacokinetics of sustained-release morphine sulfate suppositories were carried out. Drug release pattern in vitro was best described by zero-order kinetics and in vivo profile was demonstrated to fit single compartment model. When r 2 > 0.95, the plasma concentration in vivo shown a platform. The MRTs of F4 and P4 were 16.72 and 9.19 h, which shown that the poloxamer-based morphine sulfate suppository F4 had better sustained-release performance. The pharmacokinetics pharmerers were: t 1/2(ke) =7.225 h, t peak =5.107 h, \u03c1 max = 1141 ng \u00b7 mL -1, AUC =22817 ng \u00b7 h \u00b7 mL -1. The prepared poloxamer-based suppository of morphine sulfate F4 exhibits sustained-release profile in vivo, which has the value of industrialization.

        "abstract": "A set of 185 strains of Candida albicans from patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and from non-VVC clinical sources in southwest China was analyzed. Strains were subjected to genotyping using CAI microsatellite typing and amplification of an intron-containing region of the 25S rRNA gene. Microsatellite genotypes of strains from non-VVC sources showed high polymorphism, while those of VVC were dominated by few, closely similar genotypes. However, among non-VVC strains, two genotypes were particularly prevalent in patients with lung cancer. 25S rDNA genotype A was dominant in VVC sources (86.7%), while genotypes A, B and C were rather evenly distributed among non-VVC sources; known genotypes D and E were not found. In an experimental mouse model, isolates from lung cancer and AIDS patients proved to have higher virulence than VVC strains. Among 156 mice infected with C. albicans, 19 developed non-invasive urothelial carcinoma. No correlation could be established between parameters of virulence, source of infection, and incidence of carcinoma. C. albicans strains from VVC were less susceptible to itraconazole than the strains from non-VVC sources, while there was small difference in antifungal susceptibility between different 25S rDNA genotypes of C. albicans tested against amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole and flucytosine.",

Phylogenetic relationships of 24 clinical isolates of the D. rugosa complex are reconstructed using multilocus sequence analysis of five housekeeping genes, supplemented with phenotypic studies of CandiSelect\u2122 4 Agar and nutritional physiology. Diutina mesorugosa could not meaningfully be distinguished from D. rugosa and is regarded as a synonym. Diutina neorugosa and D. pseudorugosa represent separate, distantly related species within the genus Diutina, but have as yet not been encountered in clinical settings.",

For diagnostics in the clinical laboratory, simplified alternatives to barcoding are needed. CandiSelect 4 (CS4) medium, a chromogenic medium for isolation of clinical yeasts, allows routine recognition of Candida albicans and presumptive identification of Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei. We evaluated an extension of this method with 46 non-Candida albicans Candida (NCAC) and 7 Malassezia species. The medium supported growth of all species tested and a wide diversity of cultural types were observed. Colony colours were in violet, turquoise (including green and blue), or white tinges. Eight NCAC species produced violet pigmentation similar to that of C. albicans. Most NCAC species, including C. glabrata and C. tropicalis were distributed in the turquoise group. Malassezia species were invariably blue.",

        "abstract": "Environmental temperature has a significant impact on insect behavior. The present study aimed to determine the effects of temperature on the development, survival, and reproduction of Thrips hawaiiensis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), an important flower-inhabiting thrips. These effects were evaluated at five constant temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27, and 30\u00b0C) on thrips reared in the laboratory on excised Gardenia jasminoides flowers. The developmental durations of egg, first instar, second instar, prepupa, pupa, and the entire immature stages were shortened in response to a temperature increase from 18 to 30\u00b0C. The highest generational survival rate was at 27\u00b0C (75.00%), whereas the lowest was at 18\u00b0C (46.00%). The minimum threshold and effective accumulated temperatures for completing a generation of T. hawaiiensis were 7.62\u00b0C and 171.26 degree-days, respectively. The highest fecundity (95.80) was at 27\u00b0C, but it was not significantly different than at 24\u00b0C (84.72) or 30\u00b0C (84.32). The highest oviposition rate of 5.57 eggs per female per day occurred at 27\u00b0C, which was significantly higher than at any other temperature. Both the highest intrinsic rate of increase, at 0.200, and net reproduction rate, at 44.97, for T. hawaiiensis were observed at 27\u00b0C, whereas the lowest values of 0.114 and 25.56, respectively, were observed at 18\u00b0C. These results suggest that T. hawaiiensis is well adapted to temperate conditions, with an optimal temperature range for development of 24 to 30\u00b0C, with the most suitable temperature for both development and reproduction being 27\u00b0C.",

In this study, we identified and characterized a full-length cDNA of the CDA gene (SpCDA1) in the drugstore beetle, Stegobium paniceum. The open reading frame of SpCDA1 (1614\u202fbp) encoded a 537 amino acid protein, which possessed typical domain structures of CDAs. Phylogenetic comparison to other insect CDAs revealed that SpCDA1 belongs to Group Ib CDAs. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that SpCDA1 was highly expressed in late larval stages. Significant increase of SpCDA1 transcript level in the larvae was observed upon the exposure of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of SpCDA1 into the late larvae significantly reduced SpCDA1 transcript levels, resulted in larval-pupal molting difficulty and produced high larval mortality. After 15\u202fdays, the survival rate of S. paniceum in dsSpCDA1 group was significantly reduced by 72% compared to the control. The results demonstrated that SpCDA1 is essential for successful larval-pupal transition in S. paniceum and this gene may be a potential target for pest control.",

        "abstract": "The Western flower thrips (WFT, ) is a global polyphagous pest that is often dependent on chemical control. Imidacloprid has been a commonly used chemical insecticide for effective control of WFT. Low concentrations of insecticides can have sublethal effects on individual insects. However, no more information is known about the effects of exposure at low concentrations of imidacloprid on WFT. Here, we evaluated the effects of imidacloprid at sublethal concentrations on WFT population growth parameters. We first exposed the parental generation to LC (56.8 mg/L) and LC (79.2 mg/L) concentrations of imidacloprid. We then quantified various parameters related to the development, survival, and fecundity of the F\u2081 generation also exposed to these same concentrations. The development time of the treatment groups exposed to imidacloprid was significantly shorter than the control group, and the net reproductive rate (\u2080) was significantly higher for treatment groups than for the control group. For both variables, there was no significant difference between LC and LC exposure. The generational survival rate was significantly higher for the control group, followed by the LC treatment group and then the LC treatment group. However, the opposite was true for fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase () of WFT. In summary, exposure to low concentrations of imidacloprid was positive for the population development of WFT, which may contribute to the development of insecticide resistance and cause resurgence in WFT populations.",

This genome comprises 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and an A\u2009+\u2009T-rich region. The gene order of S. paniceum was similar to those found in other known Coleoptera species. Sixteen reading frame overlaps and six intergenic regions were found in the mitochondrial genome of S. paniceum. All 22 tRNA genes have the typical cloverleaf secondary structure, with an exception for trnS1 (AGN). The phylogenetic relationships based on neighbour-joining method revealed that S. paniceum is closely related to Apatides fortis, which is consistent with the traditional morphological classification.",

The gene order and orientation of L. serricorne were identical to those of other Coleopteran mitogenomes. ATG, ATA, ATT, ATC, TTG were initiation codons and TAA, TAG, T were termination codons. All 22 tRNA genes were predicted with a typical cloverleaf structure except for trnS1 (AGN).

        "abstract": "The Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is one of the most destructive sucking pests of flowering plants. We examined behavioral responses of F. occidentalis adults to the floral volatiles of Rosa chinensis, Gardenia jasminoides, and Tagetes erecta in a Y-tube olfactometer with background visual cues (green, red, white, yellow, and blue backgrounds). The results show that F. occidentalis adults had similar responses under all the different background colors, but the responses by sex varied significantly when offered floral volatile or clean air. In pairings of floral volatiles, female F. occidentalis adults presented significant preferences (R. chinensis u003e G. jasminoides u003e T. erecta) in each treatment, while male F. occidentalis adults had no significant preference. Furthermore, the responses of female F. occidentalis adults to the three different floral volatiles compared with each other were greater under green and blue backgrounds than red, white, or yellow backgrounds. However, the responses of male F. occidentalis adults to floral volatiles were similar to all five backgrounds. These results indicate that female thrips could discriminate different floral volatiles, while male thrips could not. Both male and female thrips performed steady preferences of floral volatiles under all the five visual backgrounds, and the behavioral responses of female thrips to the floral volatiles could be enhanced under the green and blue backgrounds. These findings could hopefully aid in the development of effective trapping and monitoring strategies for this pest.",

        "abstract": "Gardenia jasminoides and Rosa chinensis are economically important horticultural plants in China. Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips hawaiiensis are serious coexisting pests that previously demonstrated opposite population trends on G. jasminoides and R. chinensis flowers. To further study the different performances between F. occidentalis and T. hawaiiensis, we investigated their population dynamics in the field (for 5 years) and their life history characteristics on the two flowers in the laboratory. In the field, the density of F. occidentalis was lower than that of T. hawaiiensis on G. jasminoides but was higher than that of T. hawaiiensis on R. chinensis. Under laboratory conditions, F. occidentalis showed significantly slower development, and lower survival and fecundity levels than T. hawaiiensis on G. jasminoides, but the opposite was true on R. chinensis. Significant differences in the net reproductive rate (R 0) between F. occidentalis and T. hawaiiensis were observed, with respective values of 38.66 \u00b1 2.85 and 47.91 \u00b1 2.70 on G. jasminoides, and 55.64 \u00b1 2.15 and 32.45 \u00b1 2.16 on R. chinensis. The intrinsic rates of increase (r m ) of F. occidentalis and T. hawaiiensis were 0.156 \u00b1 0.008 and 0.198 \u00b1 0.007, respectively, on G. jasminoides, and 0.172 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.165 \u00b1 0.002, respectively, on R. chinensis. Thus, the performances of both thrips with respect to population size in the laboratory were in accordance with those in the field, suggesting that the innate capacity for insect population increases may directly impact their population dynamics in fields. Thus, the population performance of different thrips species on flowers is species-dependent, which could be exploited in thrips control programs by breeding pest-resistant cultivars.",

        "abstract": "Lasioderma serricorne, also known as cigarette beetle, can exploit a wide variety of stored materials as foods, but it is particularly common on tobacco and herbs. This beetle is a dominant pest species of stored Chinese medicinal materials (CMMs) causing high economic damages, making effective control strategies urgently needed. Behavioural manipulation is an important component of Integrated Pest Management. To the best of our knowledge, plant-borne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have never been explored to develop lures for managing L. serricorne. In this study, the behavioural responses of L. serricorne to VOCs from four selected CMMs (Euphorbia kansui, Aconitum carmichaelii, Eucommia ulmoides and Pinellia ternata) were studied and their components analysed. Then, the olfactory responses of L. serricorne to the most abundant VOC identified in the preferred CMM, i.e., paeonal, was tested. L. serricorne showed significant differences in its preferences for the VOCs from the four CMMs, i.e, E. kansui\u2009>\u2009A. carmichaelii\u2009>\u2009E. ulmoides\u2009>\u2009P. ternata. From the VOCs of E. kansui, A. carmichaelii, E. ulmoides, and P. ternata, 77, 74, 56, and 81 molecules, were identified, respectively. Paeonal (23.5%), junipene (17.2%), hexanal (17.1%), and benzeneacetonitrile (14.0%) were the most abundant, respectively. Since paeonal dominated the VOC spectrum of the most preferred CMM, this compound was selected for further studies. L. serricorne showed significant positive responses to paeonal tested at various doses, with the most attractive ones being 100\u2009\u03bcg and 500\u2009\u03bcg. Our findings shed light on the olfactory cues routing the food searching behaviour in the cigarette beetle, providing important information on how L. serricorne targets particular CMMs. The high attractiveness of paeonal at low doses tested here may be exploited further to develop novel monitoring and control tools (e.g., lure-and-kill strategies) against this important stored product pest.",

The four cDNAs encoded proteins of 169, 180, 181, and 194 amino acids with molecular weights of 19.4, 20.2, 20.3, and 22.2 kDa, respectively. The four  sequences possessed a typical sHsp domain structure.

Transcripts of three  genes were highly expressed in the larval fat body, whereas  displayed an extremely high expression level in the gut. Expression of the four  genes was dramatically upregulated in larvae exposed to 20-hydroxyecdysone. The majority of the  genes were significantly upregulated in response to heat and cold treatments, while  was insensitive to cold stress. The four genes were upregulated when challenged by immune triggers (peptidoglycan isolated from  and from  0111:B4). Exposure to CO increased  and  transcript levels, but the  transcript level declined. The results suggest that different  genes play important and distinct regulatory roles in  development and in response to diverse stresses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    Stegobium paniceum  (L.) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) is among the major pests of stored products, causing great damage to stored Chinese medicinal plant materials (CMPMs) in China. Effective control strategies are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to explore the role of volatile organic compounds in the host preference of  S.\u00a0paniceum . First, the olfactory behavioral responses of  S.\u00a0paniceum  adults to volatiles from four CMPMs ( Panax notoginseng ,  Angelica sinensis ,  Gastrodia elata , and  Peucedanum praeruptorum ) were tested in Y-tube olfactometer experiments. Then, the volatile composition of these plant materials were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  S.\u00a0paniceum  showed significant preferences for volatiles from the four CMPMs, compared with clean air (CA). When  S.\u00a0paniceum  was presented with choices among different CMPMs, it showed the strongest preference for  P.\u00a0notoginseng , followed by  A.\u00a0sinensis , then  G.\u00a0elata , and  P.\u00a0praeruptorum . GC-MS analysis identified 43, 34, 28 and 60 components in the volatile profiles of  P.\u00a0notoginseng ,  A.\u00a0sinensis ,  G.\u00a0elata , and  P.\u00a0praeruptorum , respectively. Falcarinol (14.4%), 3-n-butyl phthalide (78.7%), p-cresol (40.1%), and \u03b2-pinene (29.1%) were the most abundant components of the volatiles of  P.\u00a0notoginseng ,  A.\u00a0sinensis ,  G.\u00a0elata , and  P.\u00a0praeruptorum , respectively. The olfactory responses of  S.\u00a0paniceum  to the four CMPMs demonstrated that host-related volatiles play an important role in the host-searching process by adult beetles. This information will be useful for the development of safe and effective trapping strategies for this pest.",

In this study, we identified and characterized a full-length cDNA of  NAG1  ( LsNAG1 ) in the cigarette beetle,  Lasioderma serricorne  (Fabricius). The open reading frame of  LsNAG1  was 1821 bp and encoded 606 amino acid residues that contained typical domain structure of NAGs. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the deduced protein LsNAG1 was orthologous to another insect group I NAGs. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that  LsNAG1  expression levels peaked periodically in the late larval and late pupal stages. A significantly increased level of  LsNAG1  transcripts was observed in larvae exposed to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), indicating  LsNAG1  was responsive to 20E. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of  LsNAG1  into 4th instar larvae and late pupae significantly reduced  LsNAG1  transcript levels in both stages, and led to severe molting defects and high mortality. Compared with the control insects injected with ds GFP , 48% and 83% of the larvae and pupae injected with ds LsNAG1 , respectively, died during or soon after molting to the next stage. These results demonstrate that  LsNAG1  may play a crucial role in successful larval\u2013pupal and pupal\u2013adult transitions, and could be used as an efficient novel target for storage pest control.",

        "abstract": "The Western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis) is a global polyphagous pest that is often dependent on chemical control. Imidacloprid has been a commonly used chemical insecticide for effective control of WFT. Low concentrations of insecticides can have sublethal effects on individual insects. However, no more information is known about the effects of exposure at low concentrations of imidacloprid on WFT. Here, we evaluated the effects of imidacloprid at sublethal concentrations on WFT population growth parameters. We first exposed the parental generation to LC10 (56.8 mg/L) and LC25 (79.2 mg/L) concentrations of imidacloprid. We then quantified various parameters related to the development, survival, and fecundity of the F1 generation also exposed to these same concentrations. The development time of the treatment groups exposed to imidacloprid was significantly shorter than the control group, and the net reproductive rate (R0) was significantly higher for treatment groups than for the control group. For both variables, there was no significant difference between LC10 and LC25 exposure. The generational survival rate was significantly higher for the control group, followed by the LC10 treatment group and then the LC25 treatment group. However, the opposite was true for fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of WFT. In summary, exposure to low concentrations of imidacloprid was positive for the population development of WFT, which may contribute to the development of insecticide resistance and cause resurgence in WFT populations.",

        "abstract": "Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects. To study the function of trehalase during exposure to low temperatures, three other novel cDNAs of trehalase were cloned from  by transcriptome sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. One of the cloned cDNAs encoded a soluble trehalase, the second trehalase cDNA encoded a transmembrane-like domain, and the third cDNA encoded a membrane-bound protein. Therefore, these cDNAs were, respectively, named -, -, and . -, -, and  cDNAs encoded proteins containing 586, 553, and 633 amino acids with predicted masses of approximately 69.47, 63.46, and 73.66\u00a0kDa, and pIs of 9.20, 5.52, and 6.31, respectively. All three novel trehalases contained signal motifs \"PGGINKESYYLDSY\", \"QWDYPNAWPP\", and a highly conserved glycine-rich (GGGGEY) region. The expression levels of - and  mRNAs were high during adult stages, whereas - was expressed in low amounts in the fourth larval stage. The results showed that the activity of membrane-bound trehalases decreased from 25 to 10\u00a0\u00b0C and from 5 to -\u20095\u00a0\u00b0C during cooling. The results also revealed a decreasing trend in expression of the three  mRNAs during the cooling treatment, and an initial decrease followed by an increase during the process of re-warming.",

Olfactory response was measured on both undamaged and mechanically-damaged plants. Regardless of plant damaged, female F. occidentalis responded positively to the odors of cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, and eggplant, but showed negative responses to celery and garlic, when offered a choice of plant odor or clean air. When female thrips were offered choices between each possible pairing of undamaged plants, or pairings of mechanically-damaged plants, the order of preference was cabbage = lettuce = cucumber > eggplant > celery = garlic. Male thrips responded differently, males responded positively only to undamaged lettuce and eggplant compared to clean air, while among mechanically-damaged plants only cucumber elicited a positive response. Given a choice between all possible pairings of undamaged plants, male thrips preferred lettuce to celery, and eggplant to garlic, whereas among pairings of mechanically-damaged plants male thrips preferred lettuce to celery, and cucumber to eggplant. The order of suitability of the six host plants based on life table parameters for F. occidentalis was essentially the same as the order of preference by female thrips. These results indicate that host plant odor is an important cue for female F. occidentalis in recognizing hosts suitable for oviposition. Information on plant attraction and repellency may be useful in thrips pest management. In addition, the correspondence of preference and performance that we found suggests that evolution of local host adaptation and, perhaps, host specialization, is possible.",

The volatiles released from beans subjected to various treatments were evaluated by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. We found that TSSM was more likely to select bean plants infested for 2 days when the density was 5 WFT/plant. TSSM preferred bean plants infested for 4 days when the density was 10 or 15 WFT/plant. Irrespective of the WFT density, TSSM had the lowest preference for healthy beans and beans infested for 6 days. When the WFT infestation duration was the same, the percentage of TSSM was greatest on beans infested with 10 WFT, and there were no significant differences among the other three bean plant treatments.

We conducted a 5-month mesocosm study to elucidate the responses of the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria spinulosa and phytoplankton to four different doses of cadmium (Cd): 0 (control), 0.05, 0.5, and 5\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22122 (CK, I, II, and III, respectively) under mesotrophic conditions. We found that total phosphorus concentrations were larger in the three Cd pulse treatments, whereas total nitrogen concentrations did not differ among the four treatments. The contents of chlorophyll a and soluble sugar in macrophyte leaves decreased in III, and total biomass, ramet number, plant height, and total stolon length of macrophytes were lower in both II and III. In contrast, abundances of the three main phytoplankton taxa\u2014Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta\u2014did not differ among treatments. Total phytoplankton biomass was, however, marginally lower in CK than in the Cd treatments. We conclude that exposure to strong Cd pulses led to significantly reduced growth of macrophytes, while no obvious effect appeared for phytoplankton.",

        "abstract": "Ottelia alismoides is a constitutive C4 plant and bicarbonate user, and has facultative crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) at low CO2. Acclimation to a factorial combination of light and CO2 showed that the ratio of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) to ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (>5) is in the range of that of C4 plants. This and short-term response experiments showed that the activity of PEPC and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) was high even at the end of the night, consistent with night-time acid accumulation and daytime carbon fixation. The diel acidity change was maximal at high light and low CO2 at 17-25 \u00b5equiv g-1 FW. Decarboxylation proceeded at ~2-3 \u00b5equiv g-1 FW h-1, starting at the beginning of the photoperiod, but did not occur at high CO2; the rate was greater at high, compared with low light. There was an inverse relationship between starch formation and acidity loss. Acidity changes account for up to 21% of starch production and stimulate early morning photosynthesis, but night-time accumulation of acid traps <6% of respiratory carbon release. Ottelia alismoides is the only known species to operate CAM and C4 in the same tissue, and one of only two known aquatic species to operate CAM and bicarbonate use.",

In the present study, we conduct a field investigation of three aquatic macrophytes: Stuckenia pectinata, Myriophyllum spicatum, and Potamogeton perfoliatus. Our results showed that widespread species, including S. pectinata and M. spicatum had greater plasticity in their allocation patterns in the form of increased sexual and asexual reproduction, and greater potential to set seeds and increase fitness in more eutrophic environments. P. perfoliatus also exhibited a capacity to adopt varied sexual reproductive strategies such as setting more offspring for the future, although only in clear conditions with low nutrient levels. Our results establish strategies and mechanisms of some species for tolerating and surviving in varied eutrophic lake conditions.",

        "abstract": "Submerged macrophytes are considered the main primary producers in shallow lakes. Recently, they have experienced a decline due to increasing environmental impacts, e.g., excessive heavy metal loads. Compared to extensive studies on vegetative growth, reports on effects of heavy metals on propagule germination and reproduction remain scarce. In this study, three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) on the propagule germination and sexual reproduction of submerged macrophytes. In Experiment I, six Cd concentrations were used (0, 0.05, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5\u202fmg\u202fL), with seed germination found to be marginally affected by Cd treatment. In Experiment II, Cd exposure (5\u202fd) at the six Cd concentrations was performed 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120\u202fd prior to the designated germination date for turions/tubers. The Vallisneria spinulosa tubers did not germinate at \u2265 2.5\u202fmg Cd L when exposed to Cd 90 and 120\u202fd prior to germination, whereas the Potamogeton crispus turions remained viable but with a low germination rate at \u2265 2.5\u202fmg Cd L. In Experiment III, with an increase from 0 to 0.5 Cd mg L, the fruit weight of Ottelia alismoides and V.\u00a0spinulosa decreased, whereas the fruit number increased for O.\u00a0alismoides but not for V.\u00a0spinulosa. Furthermore, the phenology of sexual reproduction for both species advanced under Cd exposure. In summary, Cd exposure affected the germination of asexual propagules and sexual reproduction of submerged macrophytes, with seeds found to be tolerant of Cd treatment up to 5\u202fmg\u202fL.",

        "abstract": "The global climate change may lead to more extreme climate events such as severe flooding creating excessive pulse-loading of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), to freshwaters. We conducted a 3-month mesocosm study to investigate the responses of phytoplankton, zooplankton and Vallisneria spinulosa to different N loading patterns using weekly and monthly additions of in total 14 g N m\u22122 month\u22121 during the first 2 months. The monthly additions led to higher phytoplankton chlorophyll a and total phytoplankton biomass than at ambient conditions as well as lower leaf biomass and a smaller ramet number of V. spinulosa. Moreover, the biomass of cyanobacteria was higher during summer (August) in the monthly treatments than those with weekly or no additions. However, the biomass of plankton and macrophytes did not differ among the N treatments at the end of the experiment, 1 month after the termination of N addition. We conclude that by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton (cyanobacteria) and reducing the growth of submerged macrophytes, short-term extreme N loading may have significant effects on shallow nutrient-rich lakes and that the lakes may show fast recovery if they are not close to the threshold of a regime shift from a clear to a turbid state.",

        "abstract": "It remains an open question whether or not artificial macrophytes are good alternatives to natural macrophytes in studies of periphyton abundance and composition in lakes. Here, a mesocosm experiment was conducted in winter (when plant growth is low) to compare simultaneously the periphyton community on three submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton lucens, Vallisneria sp. and Cabomba caroliniana) with contrasting leaf structural complexities (leaf fractal dimension\u00a0=\u00a01.12, 1.17 and 1.37, respectively) and on three types of artificial macrophytes with similar morphologies as the natural plants. We also compared intertreatment differences in phytoplankton sampled from mesocosms.Both for natural and artificial macrophytes, the periphyton chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was positively associated with leaf fractal dimension. Although the morphological structure of natural and artificial plants and the physicochemical characteristics of the water were similar, the periphyton community differed between natural and artificial macrophytes, with the difference being dependent on the leaf structural complexity of the macrophytes. For leaves with a simple structural complexity, the abundance and composition of periphyton on natural and artificial plants were not statistically different. In addition, periphyton Chl-a, density and biovolume were higher on the adaxial side than on the abaxial side of natural P.\u00a0lucens leaves, but no differences were found between sides of the artificial leaves.For leaves with a medium structural complexity, the abundance of periphyton was lower on the natural than artificial plants, and the proportion of diatoms to the total community differed. For leaves with a high structural complexity, periphyton Chl-a of the artificial plants was notably higher than on the natural plants, while no significant differences were found for periphyton density, biovolume, and the proportion of diatoms and green algae.Permutational multivariate analysis of periphyton genus composition confirmed that periphyton composition on the artificial plants (medium and high leaf structural complexities) was different overall from that on the natural plants.Phytoplankton Chl-a, density, biovolume, and diversity did not show any pronounced differences among treatments.Our results suggest that artificial macrophytes cannot fully substitute for natural plants even when they are morphologically similar. Artificial macrophytes should therefore be used with caution when investigating the periphyton community on macrophytes.",

Here, we produced two contrasting artificial water environments (eutrophic and oligotrophic) for reciprocal transplant experiment of Myriophyllum spicatum, to recover the colonization of epiphytic bacteria accompanied with plants growth. Comparative analysis addressed a higher species diversity in epiphytic bacteria than in bacterioplankton, and the highest microbiome richness in sediment. Our data revealed that the organization of epiphytic bacterial community was interfered by both plant status (i.e. branch number, net photosynthesis rate etc.) and water bodies (i.e. total phosphate, total nitrogen, pH etc.) while plant status effected the assembly in priority to water. 16S rRNA sequencing further indicated that the epiphytic assemblies were motivated by functionalization and interplay with hosts as a whole. The results complemented new evidences for the 9lottery process9 in the epiphytic bacteria assembly traits and shed insights into the assembly patterns referring to functional adaptation across epiphytic bacteria and macrophytes.",

Thirteen dams commissioned along the Wujiang River have induced ecological problems, including decreased water turbidity and loss of biodiversity, which potentially influence ecosystem net primary production (NPP) and hence the sequestration, transformation, and storage of carbon. We used terrestrial NPP (NPPT) as a bioindicator to assess the impact of dams on carbon storage in the Wujiang catchment. MODIS satellite and meteorological data were used as inputs to the CASA model to calculate annual NPPT from 2000 to 2014. NPPT was calculated at the catchment and landscape scale to quantify the impact of dams on surrounding terrestrial ecosystems. Mean NPPT was calculated for concentric buffer zones covering a range of spatial extents (0\u201310 km) from the reservoir shoreline. We found a negligible impact from construction of a single dam on NPPT at the catchment...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Submerged macrophytes are important for maintaining a clear water state in shallow lakes but are now threatened by the ongoing climate changes involving more extreme weather events. We explored the effects of extreme precipitation (higher water level, higher loading of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen)) on the growth of the submerged macrophyte  Vallisneria denseserrulata  Makino in a 10-month long mesocosm experiment. We used three macrophyte communities (one, three and six species) and four simulated scenarios of water level and nutrient loading (constant 75 cm, no nutrient loading; gradual water level increase from 75 cm to 150 cm over three months; extreme water level increase to 150 cm within one day at the same nutrient loading as in the gradual increase; constant 75 cm and the same nutrient loading as in the two former treatments). Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, biomass, morphology of macrophytes and periphyton biomass were recorded. In the treatment with an extreme increase in water level, macrophyte biomass declined, whereas plant height and leaf number remained unchanged compared with the treatments where only nutrient but not water levels were increased. The combined effect of increased water level and enhanced nutrient loading (gradual and extreme change) did not differ significantly from the constant 75cm treatment without additional nutrient loading. No significant differences were found in epiphyton biomass among the water level treatments, while epipelon biomass was marginally higher and plant volume inhabited lower in the two treatments with a water level increase. Changes in macrophyte assemblages only had limited effects on maximum leaf width and the relative electron transport rate of  V. denseserrulata . In conclusion,  V. denseserrulata  was overall resilient to the major simulated changes in precipitation, except when the water level increased suddenly, and only marginally influenced (leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameter) by the composition of the macrophyte assemblage.",

We performed a 5-month experiment (starting in winter, December) to elucidate the responses of three phototrophic communities (macrophyte\u2014Potamogeton crispus, periphyton, phytoplankton) and their interactions to elevated temperature (4.5 \u00b0C) under eutrophic, subtropical conditions. The biomass and composition of periphyton were not significantly affected by increased temperature, while the biomass of phytoplankton increased with a shift in phytoplankton composition towards higher dominance of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria. Warming also reduced the survival of P. crispus and accelerated the decline of P. crispus. At both ambient and heated temperatures, a shift occurred at the end of the experiment from a clear-state dominated by P. crispus to a clear-state dominated by filamentous algae and warming facilitated this shift. Our results thus indicated that, when submerged macrophytes diminished or disappeared, filamentous algae exhibited functional compensation that maintained low phytoplankton development, primarily at elevated temperatures.",

Myriophyllum spicatum  is one of the most eutrophication tolerant submerged macrophyte species.  M .  spicatum  from Fuxian (oligotrophic) and Xingyun (eutrophic) lakes, in South West China, were cultured in water conditions corresponding to their origin and the alternative trophic state (4 treatments) for a year. Each treatment was exposed to NH 4  + \u2013N (0, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/L) for five days (24 treatments) to investigate the effect of the sources and acute NH 4  + \u2013N enrichment on photosynthetic performance. Both sources and NH 4  + \u2013N affected photosynthetic performance, and eutrophic source plants in high nutrients and oligotrophic source plants in low nutrients exhibited higher NH 4  + \u2013N tolerance. High nutrient cultured individuals had higher leaf number, branching, and heights. There were trade-offs between NH 4  + \u2013N tolerance in turbid high nutrient conditions and photosynthetic performance in low nutrient conditions with high irradiance. Oligotrophic source plants in low nutrients had the highest chlorophyll  a  levels at \u226410\u00a0mg/L, which dropped markedly afterwards. Soluble carbohydrates and starch decreased at \u226550\u00a0mg/L and \u22655\u00a0mg/L, respectively. Individuals growing in eutrophic conditions could be prone to higher damage in the field owing to potentially weaker stem and leaf biomechanical properties, because of carbohydrate and energy intensive NH 4  + \u2013N detoxification in higher NH 4  + \u2013N conditions.",

        "abstract": "Wetland degradation is a source of anxiety and is more severe in cold regions than other areas. The soil seed bank acts as a propagule source for revegetation to affiliate the restoration of degraded wetlands. However, the effects of this approach are controversial and depend on the traits of the seed bank and its interactions with the environment. The seed bank in an alpine fen meadow was studied to determine its exact role in revegetation. The surveyed shore of a Tibetan lake, Gahai Lake, was divided into three sites under different levels of grazing pressure. Each site was separated into six transects along a water-depth gradient to collect soil cores to determine the pattern of biodiversity through a germination experiment in a greenhouse. After an analysis of heterogeneity-related diversity, partitioning of 58 discovered species indicated that 39.5 could be contributed to beta-diversity, which was mainly contributed to water depth. Overgrazing (0.607 sheep unit/acre, November\u2014March) decreased seed bank diversity in many respects, especially through decreasing spatial heterogeneity and homogenizing biota. A lightly grazed, well-protected site had not only the highest beta-diversity and species abundance but also the highest inter-site species turnover rate compared with other sites under moderate grazing intensity. Despite the lack of target species, the seed bank serves as (i) a species-rich pool; (ii) an extant legacy seed source for sustaining heterogeneity and floristic diversity; and (iii) an ecological indicator, and its effect can be reinforced by appropriate grazing practices (multiple intensity) and hydrological modifications.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Periphyton in aquatic ecosystems is comprised of algae, heterotrophic microbes, and detritus. In shallow lakes, periphyton is affected by substrate type, nutrient supply, and other factors. Periphyton on macrophytes can interact strongly with the host, but whether different periphyton on non-plant substrates are affected by nearby submerged macrophytes is unclear. We conducted a six-month mesocosm study to investigate the responses of periphyton (on sand, cobblestone, or plastic) to different nitrogen concentrations (i.e., 10\u2009mg\u2009L -1  ammonia, 10\u2009mg\u2009L -1  nitrate, or no addition) in the presence of different macrophyte species (i.e.,  Vallisneria spinulosa, Potamogeton wrightii , and  Potamogeton maackianus ). Periphytic pigment content (chlorophyll and pheophytin), nutrient accrual (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), carbon:chlorophyll ratio, and algal species composition were determined at the end of the experiment. Results showed that substrate type was critical for all periphyton parameters. Periphytic nutrient accrual and the carbon:chlorophyll ratio were both higher on sand than on the other two substrates. Nitrogen concentrations had a considerable effect on periphytic chlorophyll-a, nitrogen, and phosphorus accrual. In particular, the addition of ammonia (but not nitrate) led to significantly higher periphytic chlorophyll-a than the treatment without nitrogen. Furthermore, periphytic algal species richness and diversity were lower in the presence of  P. wrightii  than in the presence of the other macrophyte species. Thus, in addition to the importance of substrate type and nitrogen concentration, the species composition of nearby submerged macrophytes could potentially influence the periphyton community on a non-plant substrate.",

        "abstract": "Submerged macrophytes play a structuring role in the shallow freshwater ecosystem by increasing the heterogeneous state in freshwaters. The macrophytes in genus Ottelia were featured for their broad leaves, which might consequently produce specialized functions that differed from other submerged species. To explore the potential ecological role of Ottelia, a field investigation was conducted on leaf traits in eight populations of Ottelia ranging from the southwestern Yunnan-Guizhou plateau to the southern Hainan island in China covering a distance of u003e 1700 km. The eight populations included all the extant Ottelia species and varieties in China except the well-documented O. alismoides. Carbon-related traits (bicarbonate usage, photosynthetic characteristics, capability of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)), pigment content and parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence, morphology and mass of the leaves were determined. The different populations showed distinct functional traits of mature leaves; O. acuminata var. songmingensis had the thickest and longest leaf with CaCO3 precipitation on the both sides of the leaf, and O. cordata showed putative CAM activity with the highest diel acidity changes 12.5 \u03bcequiv g\u22121 FW. Our results indicated an important role of Ottelia populations in carbon cycling as the dominant species in karst freshwaters in China.",

        "abstract": "Global warming may affect snail\u2013periphyton\u2013macrophyte relationships in lakes with implications also for water clarity. We conducted a 40-day aquaria experiment to elucidate the response of submerged macrophytes and periphyton on real and artificial plants to elevated temperatures (3\u00b0C) under eutrophic conditions, with and without snails present. With snails, the biomass and length of  leaves increased more at the high temperature, and at both temperatures growth was higher than in absence of snails. The biomass of periphyton on  as well as on artificial plants was higher at the highest temperature in the absence but not in the presence of snails. The biomass of  (in a decaying state) declined in all treatments and was not affected by temperature or snails. While total snail biomass did not differ between temperatures, lower abundance of adults (size >1\u00a0cm) was observed at the high temperatures. We conclude that the effect of elevated temperature on the snail\u2013periphyton\u2013macrophyte relationship in summer differs among macrophyte species in active growth or senescent species in subtropical lakes and that snails, when abundant, improve the chances of maintaining actively growing macrophytes under eutrophic conditions, and more so in a warmer future with potentially denser growth of periphyton.",

        "abstract": "Shallow lakes are a key component of the global carbon cycle. It is, therefore, important to know how shallow lake ecosystems will respond to the current climate change. Global warming affects not only average temperatures, but also the frequency of heat waves (HW). The impact of extreme events on ecosystems processes, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is uncertain.Using the worldu0027s longest-running shallow lake experiment, we studied the effects of a simulated summer HW on the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The experimental mesocosms had been exposed to different temperature treatments and nutrient loading for 11\u00a0years prior to the artificial HW.In general, there was an increase in total GHG emissions during the 1-month artificial HW, with a significant increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O being observed in the shallow lake mesocosms. No significant effect of the HW on CO2 emissions could be traced, though, in the mesocosms with high nutrient levels. Furthermore, the data suggested that in addition to the direct effect of increased temperature on metabolic processes during the HW, biotic interactions exerted a significant control of GHG emissions. For example, at low nutrient levels, increased CO2 emissions were associated with low macrophyte abundance, whereas at high nutrient levels, decreased phytoplankton abundance was linked to increased emissions of CO2 and CH4.In contrast to the observable heat-wave effect, no clear general effect of the long-term temperature treatments could be discerned over the summer, likely because the potential effects of the moderate temperature increase, applied as a press disturbance, were overridden by biotic interactions. This study demonstrates that the role of biotic interactions needs to be considered within the context of global warming on ecosystem processes.",

        "abstract": "Shallow lakes may play an important role for the nitrogen (N) balance in drainage basins by processing, transferring and retaining N inputs. An increase in the frequency of storm-induced short-term N pulses and increased water temperatures are both likely outcomes of climate change, potentially affecting the N processing in lakes.An experiment with a K15NO3\u2212 pulse addition (increase in NO3\u2212 concentration from c.\u00a00.1 to 2\u00a0mg/L) was carried out in 12 mesocosms with relatively low (applies to Danish lakes) total N (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (c.\u00a00.3\u00a0mg\u00a0N\u00a0L\u22121 and 0.04\u00a0mg\u00a0P\u00a0L\u22121) to assess the effects of an N pulse on N processing and storage in shallow lake ecosystems. The mesocosms have a hydraulic retention time of approximately two and a half months, and at the time of the experiment, they had been adapted to contrasting temperatures for a period of 10\u00a0years: ambient, T3 (heating according to the Intergovernmental Panel\u00a0on Climate Change 2007 A2 scenario, +3.7\u20134.5\u00b0C, depending on season) and T5 (heating with A2\u00a0+\u00a050%, +4.9\u20136.6\u00b0C).Macrophytes and filamentous algae retained up to 40% and 30% of the added 15N, respectively, reflecting their high biomass in the mesocosms. Macrophytes and filamentous algae constituted between 70% and 80% of the biomass of all primary producers during the experiment in the T3 and ambient treatments and between 20% and 40% in T5. By comparison, less than 1% of the added 15N diffused to the sediment and less than 5% was lost to the atmosphere as N2 gas. Snails represented the long-term storage of 15N, retaining up to 6% of the tracer and with detectable enrichment 100\u00a0days after tracer addition.We found no significant differences among the temperature treatments in the 15N turnover after pulse dosing. However, a larger percentage of 15N was stored in macrophytes in the ambient and T3 mesocosms, reflecting higher biomasses than in T5 where filamentous algae were more abundant. Macrophytes and filamentous algae rather than temperature were therefore key controllers of N processing during the summer N pulse in these shallow, relatively low TP lakes.",

We used 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes in which two nutrient levels (unenriched and enriched by adding nitrogen and phosphorus) and three different temperature scenarios (ambient, IPCC A2 scenario and A2+%50) are simulated (4 replicates of each). Experiments using the mesocosms have been running un-interrupted since 2003. A 1-month heat wave was imitated by an extra 5\u202f\u00b0C increase in the previously heated mesocosms (from 1st July to 1st August 2014). Changes in water temperature induced within a few days a strong effect on the microbial food web functioning, demonstrating a quick response of microbial communities to the changes in environment, due to their short generation times. Warming and nutrients showed synergistic effects. Microbial assemblages of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates responded positively to the heating, the increase being largest in the enriched mesocosms. The results indicate that warming and nutrients in combination can set off complex interactions in the microbial food web functioning.",

Here, taking advantage of cell lineage tracing and transgenic ablation technologies, we identified a population of nkx2.3+ pouch progenitors in zebrafish embryos and demonstrated an essential requirement of ectodermal BMP2b for their specification.At early somite stages, nkx2.3+ cells located at lateral region of pharyngeal endoderm give rise to the pouch epithelium except a subpopulation expressing pdgf\u03b1a rather than nkx2.3. A small-scale screen of chemical inhibitors reveals that BMP signaling is necessary to specify these progenitors. Loss-of-function analyses show that BMP2b, expressed in the pharyngeal ectoderm, actives Smad effectors in endodermal cells to induce nkx2.3+ progenitors. Collectively, our study provides in vivo evidence for the existence of pouch progenitors and highlights the importance of BMP2b signaling in progenitor specification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC136 is a putative tumor suppressor and significantly down-regulated in gastric and colorectal cancer tissues. However, little is known about its biological functions during vertebrate embryo development. Zebrafish has two  CCDC136  orthologs,  ccdc136a  and  ccdc136b , but only  ccdc136b  is highly expressed during early embryonic development. In this study, we demonstrate that  ccdc136b  is required for dorsal-ventral axial patterning in zebrafish embryos.  ccdc136b  morphants display strongly dorsalized phenotypes. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells show that Ccdc136b is a crucial negative regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, and plays a critical role in the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis. We further find that Ccdc136b interacts with APC, promotes the binding affinity of APC with \u03b2-catenin and then facilitates the turnover of \u03b2-catenin. These results provide the first evidence that CCDC136 regulates zebrafish dorsal-ventral patterning by antagonizing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal transduction and suggest a potential mechanism underlying its suppressive activity in carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Zebrafish dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) undergo vigorous proliferation during epiboly and then exit cell cycle to generate Kupffer9s vesicle (KV), a ciliated organ necessary for establishing left-right (L-R) asymmetry. DFC proliferation defects are often accompanied by impaired cilia elongation in KV, but the functional and molecular interaction between cell-cycle progression and cilia formation remains unknown. Here we show that chemokine receptor Cxcr4a is required for L-R laterality by controlling DFC proliferation and KV ciliogenesis. Functional analysis revealed that Cxcr4a accelerates G1/S transition in DFCs and stabilizes Foxj1a, a master regulator of motile cilia, by stimulating Cyclin D1 expression through ERK1/2 signaling. Mechanistically, Cyclin D1-CDK4/6 drives G1/S transition during DFC proliferation and phosphorylates Foxj1a, thereby disrupting its association with Psmd4b, a 19S regulatory subunit. This prevents the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of Foxj1a. Our study uncovers a role for Cxcr4 signaling in L-R patterning and provides fundamental insights into the molecular linkage between cell-cycle progression and ciliogenesis.",

However, it is rarely explored on fabricating of engineered dual plasmonic hybrid nanosystem for combinatory therapeutic-diagnostic applications. Herein, rattle-type Au@Cu2\u2212xS hollow mesoporous nanoparitcles with advanced PT conversion efficiency are designed for cellular vehicles and chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy platform. The LSPR coupling between the Au core and Cu2\u2212xS shell are investigated experimentally and theoretically to generate a PT conversion efficiency high to 35.2% and enhanced by 11.3% than that of Cu2\u2212xS. By conjugating microRNA (miRNA) gene probe on the surface, it can realize the intracellular oncogenic miRNA detection. After loading of anticancer drug doxorubicin into the cavity of the Au@Cu2\u2212xS, the antitumor therapy efficacy is greatly enhanced in vitro and in vivo due to the NIR photoactivation chemo- and photothermal synergistic therapy.

        "abstract": "Lately, photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) dual-modal therapy has attracted much attention in cancer therapy as a synergistic therapeutic model. However, the integration of PDT and PTT in single nanoagent for cancer therapy is still a challenging task. Herein, an intelligent MnO2/Cu2-xS-siRNA nanoagent simultaneously overcoming inherent limitations of PDT and PTT with remarkable PTT/PDT therapeutic efficiency enabling multimode accurate tumor imaging diagnostic is designed. We first develop a general method to decorate Cu2-xS on the surface of MnO2 nanosheet (MnO2/Cu2-xS), then, it was loaded with heat shock protein (HSP) 70 siRNA to obtain MnO2/Cu2-xS-siRNA. The intracellular microRNA (miRNA) imaging can be realized by loading miRNA detection probes. In the tumor acidic microenvironment, the MnO2 is reduced to Mn2+ ion, and trigger the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The reduced Mn2+ ions significantly enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast and the Cu2-xS acts as a powerful photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) imaging agent, leading to tri-modal accurate tumor-specific imaging and detection. Under a single NIR laser irradiation, the nanosystem exhibits superiority of PTT/PDT efficiency owing to siRNA-mediated blocked heat-shock response and MnO2-related relieved tumor hypoxia. This work highlights the great promise of modulating tumor cellular defense mechanism and microenvironment with intelligent multifunctional nanoagents to achieve a comprehensive fighting cancer effect.",

Here we report a facile, multiple and sensitive miRNA detection method that uses conventional gel electrophoresis and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) system without any complex nanomaterials or enzymatic amplification.  In this study, three pairs of hairpin probes are rationally designed with thermodynamically and kinetically preferable feasibility for the CHA process. In the present of target miRNA, the stem of the corresponding hairpin detection probe (HDP) will be unfolded and expose the concealed domain. The corresponding hairpin assistant probe (HAP) then replaces the hybridized target miRNA to form specific HDP/HAP complexes and releases miRNA based on thermodynamically driven entropy gain process, and the released miRNA triggers the next recycle to produce tremendous corresponding HDP/HAP complexes.  The results showed that the CHA gel assay can detect miRNA at fM levels and shows good capability of discriminating miRNA family members and base-mismatched miRNAs. It is able to analyze miRNAs extracted from cell lysates, which are consistent with the results of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Depending on the length of the designed hairpin probes, the CHA gel assay consisting of different hairpin probes effectively discriminated and simultaneously detected multiple miRNAs in homogenous solution and miRNAs extracted from cell lysates.  The work highlights the practical use of a conventional gel electrophoresis for sensitive interesting nucleic acid sequences detection.",

The DCuS@[RBC-B16] NPs are comprehensively characterized, showing the inherent properties of the both source cells. Compared to the bare CuS NPs, the DCuS@[RBC-B16] NPs exhibit highly specific self-recognition to source cell line in vitro, and achieve markedly prolonged circulation lifetime and enhanced homogenous targeting abilities in vivo inherited from the source cells. Thus, the DOX-loaded [RBC-B16]-coated CuS NP platform exhibits excellent synergistic photothermal/chemotherapy with about 100 % melanoma tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rate.

Upon hybridization with a specific target, the TSPs immobilized on the GNP surface hybridized with the corresponding target miRNA to form DNA-RNA heteroduplexes, and the DSN can recognize the formed DNA-RNA heteroduplexes to hydrolyze the DNA in the heteroduplexes to produce a specific fluorescent signal corresponding to a specific miRNA, while the released target miRNA strands can initiate another cycle, resulting in a significant signal amplification for sensitive miRNA detection. Different targets can produce different fluorescent signals, leading to the development of a sensitive detection for multiple miRNAs in a homogeneous solution. Under optimized conditions, the proposed assay can simultaneously detect three different miRNAs in a homogeneous solution with a logarithmic linear range spanning 5 magnitudes (10-10) and achieving a limit of detection down to attomolar concentrations. Meanwhile, the proposed miRNA assay exhibited the capability of discriminating single bases (three bases mismatched miRNAs) and showed good eligibility in the analysis of miRNAs extracted from cell lysates and miRNAs in cell incubation media, which indicates its potential use in biomedical research and clinical analysis.",

Inspired by biomineralization, DNA-Cu3(PO4)2 hybrid nanoflowers (HNFs) were prepared and exhibited high stability, high surface-to-volume ratio, good DNA encapsulation ability. A facile thread platform for miRNA detection was fabricated by employing DNA-Cu3(PO4)2 HNFs as captors, and the signal could be easily read out by a personal glucose meter (PGM). The fabricated biosensor could detect miRNA-21 quantitatively and a detection limit of 0.41 nM was achieved. Furthermore, miRNA in A549 cell lysate could also be detected without pretreatment. Based on the bioinspired DNA-inorganic HNFs, this work achieves a fast, simple, low-cost method for specific and sensitive detection of miRNA both in aqueous solution and biological sample, indicating its great promise in biomedical and clinical applications.",

However, developing smart delivery systems with large gene loading capacity, biocompatibility and responsiveness remains a significant challenge. Herein, we successfully incorporated DNA-capped Au nanoparticles (NPs) and their complementary fluorescent DNA sequences into a porous 3D hydrogel network (AuDH), in which hairpin-locked DNAzyme strands and active metal ions were loaded (AuDH/M /H) for simultaneously imaging multiplex miRNAs in living cells. After transfection into cells, the specific miRNAs trigger the strand-displacement reaction and sequentially activate the DNAzyme-assisted target recycling, leading to a strong increase in the corresponding fluorescence intensity for imaging. This enables simultaneous assessment of the abundance of multiplex cancer-related miRNAs, even if at a very low expression level, in different cells through the different fluorescence intensities due to the dual signal amplification, and the change in abundance of miRNAs induced by siRNA or miRNA mimics in living cells can also be efficiently monitored. The versatile and responsive DNA hydrogel system holds great potential for miRNA biomedical applications.",

Herein, we develop a NIR-II PTA with advanced PTCE, based on a new two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin tellurium oxide/ammonium tungsten bronze (TeO2/(NH4)xWO3) nanoribbons (TONW NRs). The doped ammonia ions mediated-free electrons injection into the LUMO band of WO3 combined with the electronic transitions between W6+ ions and the lone pair of electrons in Te atoms achieve excellent NIR absorption of TONW NRs resulted from localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The polyethylene glycol functionalized TONW NRs (PEG-TONW NRs) exhibit good stability and biocompatibility, displaying a PTCE high to 43.6%, surpassing many previous nano-PTAs active in the NIR II region, leading to remarkable tumor ablation ability both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, advanced X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging capability of PEG-TONW NRs were also realized. Given the admirable photothermal effect in NIR II region, good biocompatibility and advanced CT/PA imaging diagnosis capability, the novel PEG-TONW NRs is promising in future personalized medicine application.",

To address the problem, we introduce a strategy of the low-temperature nucleus-targeted PTT in the NIR-II region achieving effective tumor killing by combing of the vanadium carbide quantum dots (V2C QDs) PTA and engineered exosomes (Ex) vector. The small fluorescent V2C QDs with good photothermal effect in the NIR-II region were modified with TAT peptides and packaged into Ex with RGD modification (V2C-TAT@Ex-RGD). The resulting nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited good biocompatibility, long circulation time and endosomal escape ability, and it could target the cell and enter into nucleus to realize low-temperature PTT with advanced tumor destruction efficiency. The fluorescent imaging, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capability of the NPs was also revealed.

It is demonstrated that one target miRNA can trigger disassembly of multiple PA fluorophore probes from the quencher with the aid of GSH-responsive DNA fuel strands via the entropy-driven process, resulting remarkable amplified change of PA signal ratio. Using oncogenic miRNA-21 as a model, a linear relationship between miRNA-21 concentrations and PA ratio in a dynamic range from 10 \u00d7 10 m to 100 \u00d7 10 m and a limit of detection down to 11.69 \u00d7 10 m are established. The accurate PA signal observation related to miRNA-21s in the tumor area in living mice is demonstrated, and the PA signal ratio increases significantly via the injection of miRNA-21.

Disrupting the stratum corneum (SC) is crucial for successful transdermal drug delivery, and thermal ablation is emerging as the advanced strategy for it. Herein, hyaluronic acid (HA) encapsulated CuS (HA-CuS) nanoparticles with excellent biocompatibility and remarkable photothermal translation efficacy were synthesized for transdermal drug delivery. The transdermal cargo delivery capability of the proposed HA-CuS gel was comprehensively investigated. Simply controlling the NIR laser irradiation power or time enabled controllable translocation of the model biomacromolecule of bovine serum albumin (BSA) into skin in vivo. Furthermore, the feasibility of the HA-CuS-mediated transdermal insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes therapy of nude mice was investigated. It presented sustained an...",

However, the synthesis and application of ultrasmall 2D SiC quantum dots (QDs) has not been explored. Herein, we synthesize a type of monolayered 2D SiC QDs with advanced photoluminescence (PL) properties via a facile hydrothermal route. Their average size and thickness can be easily adjusted by altering the reaction time. The ultrasmall 2D SiC QDs exhibit a long fluorescence lifetime of 2.59 \u03bcs due to efficient quantum confinement. The applications of SiC QDs are demonstrated through labeling A549, HeLa, and NHDF cells and delivering agents for intracellular low-abundant microRNA (miRNA) detection. This advance in preparing photoluminescent SiC QDs is of great significance for broadening their potential in biomedical and optical applications.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) that utilizes apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has received extensive attention in practical cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors significantly limits the efficacy of therapy. Approaches that overcome the barriers to PDT in hypoxic conditions by simultaneously producing ROS exogenously and improving the oxygenation of tumors have never been studied. Herein, an activatable ROS platform was designed that uses the high reactivity of peroxidase-like Fe3O4 toward endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to concurrently generate \u02d9OH as a therapeutic agent and provide O2 for oxygen-dependent PDT. Multifunctional chitosan-encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles modified with CuS and porphyrin (FCCP NPs) were fabricated to achieve multimodal imaging and synergetic therapy. The FCCP NPs possess enhanced intrinsic peroxidase mimetic activity to produce ROS and O2 from endogenous H2O2. Multimodal imaging in vivo, including photoacoustic imaging (PAI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), photoluminescence imaging (PLI), and photothermal imaging (PTI), exploits the tumor-targeting property of FCCP NPs upon intravenous injection. It can induce cancer cell death with remarkable efficiency both in vitro and in vivo via synergetic treatment with PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT). This study demonstrates the promise of the activatable generation of ROS and O2 for PDT with nanotechnology to overcome a current deficiency in cancer therapies.",

Here, we developed a double gold nanoparticles (GNPs) conjugates based lateral flow assay (D-LFA) for rapidly and sensitively detecting and molecular profiling of exosomes. Based on these two GNPs conjugates, the signal amplification can be achieved without any additional operation. The antibody on the 1st GNPs conjugate could recognize exosomes and form a sandwich format on the test zone. The 2nd GNPs conjugate was designed to bind to the 1st GNPs conjugate to realize signal amplification. This biosensor enabled visual and quantitative detection of exosomes by the accumulation of GNPs on the test zone and showed a low detection limit of 1.3\u00d7103 particles/\u03bcL, which has been improved 13-fold compared with the normal lateral flow assay. The D-LFA exhibited good sensitivity and reproducibility and has been successfully used for the detection of exosomes in fetal bovine serum, which proved its potential application in practical diagnostics.",

However, discriminatory detection of low-abundance miRNAs and pre-miRNAs remains a key challenge since the mature sequence is also present in the pre-miRNA forms. Herein, we report a novel cascade reaction to sensitively distinguish miRNAs  pre-miRNAs in living cells based on two pairs of programmable hairpin oligonucleotide probes with a simple sequence design. The programmable hairpin probes can metastably coexist until the introduction of miRNAs or pre-miRNAs, which can trigger a specific hybridization chain reaction (HCR), respectively, leading to the self-assembly of nicked DNA duplex structures and a remarkable specific fluorescence intensity increase. The system can readily and sensitively assess the miRNA or pre-miRNA abundance in a homogeneous solution. The intracellular miRNA and pre-miRNA expression level assessment in different living cells is realized. Thus, we provide a novel investigation tool for discriminatorily and accurately assessing miRNA and pre-miRNA abundance, which could be useful for the biomedical application of miRNAs.",

        "abstract": "Fabricating theranostic nanoparticles combining multimode disease diagnosis and therapeutic has become an emerging approach for personal nanomedicine. However, the diagnostic capability, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficiency of theranostic nanoplatforms limit their clinic widespread applications. Targeting to the theme of accurate diagnosis and effective therapy of cancer cells, a multifunctional nanoplatform of aptamer and polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated MoS2 nanosheets decorated with Cu1.8S nanoparticles (ATPMC) is developed. The ATPMC nanoplatform accomplishes photoluminescence imaging, photoacoustic imaging, and photothermal imaging for in vitro and in vivo tumor cells imaging diagnosis. Meanwhile, the ATPMC nanoplatform facilitates selective delivery of gene probe to detect intracellular microRNA aberrantly expressed in cancer cells and anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) for chemotherapy. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of MoS2 and Cu1.8S renders the ATPMC nanoplatform with superb photothermal conversion efficiency. The ATPMC nanoplatform loaded with DOX displays near-infrared laser-induced programmed chemotherapy and advanced photothermal therapy, and the targeted chemo-photothermal therapy presents excellent antitumor efficiency.",

        "abstract": "To achieve an excellent delivery effect of drug, stimuli-responsive nano \u201cgate\u201d with physical blockage units is usually constructed on the surface of the mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSNs). In nature, the aquaporins in cell membrane can control the transport of water molecules by regulating the channel wettability, which is resulted from the conformational change of amino acids in the channel. Inspired by this phonomenon, herein a new concept of free-blockage controlled release system is proposed, which is achieved by controlling the wettability of the internal surface of nanopores on MSNs. Such a new system is different from the physical-blockage controlled release system, which bypasses the use of nano \u201cgate\u201d and overcomes the limitations of traditional physical blockage system. Moreover, further studies have shown that the system can selectively release the entrapped doxorubicin in human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells triggered by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) but not in normalhuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) containing ROS with low levels. The wettability-determined free-blockage controlled release system is simple and effective, and it can also be triggered by intracellular biological stimuli, which provides a new approach for the future practical application of drug delivery and cancer therapy.",

However, it is rarely explored on fabricating of engineered dual plasmonic hybrid nanosystem for combinatory therapeutic-diagnostic applications. Herein, rattle-type Au@Cu 2\u2212x S hollow mesoporous nanoparitcles with advanced PT conversion efficiency are designed for cellular vehicles and chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy platform. The LSPR coupling between the Au core and Cu 2\u2212x S shell are investigated experimentally and theoretically to generate a PT conversion efficiency high to 35.2% and enhanced by 11.3% than that of Cu 2\u2212x S. By conjugating microRNA (miRNA) gene probe on the surface, it can realize the intracellular oncogenic miRNA detection. After loading of anticancer drug doxorubicin into the cavity of the Au@Cu 2\u2212x S, the antitumor therapy efficacy is greatly enhanced in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo due to the NIR photoactivation chemo- and photothermal synergistic therapy.

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) DNA walking machines inspired by natural molecular machines have attracted significant attention due to their high walking efficiency and signal amplification capability. Herein, we report a 3D DNA walking machine for the dual-modal detection of miRNA using a fluorometer and personal glucose meter (PGM). The 3D DNA walking machine on magnetic beads (MBs) was coated with the BHQ-H1-FAM hairpin structures (DNA tracks), activated by target miRNA-21 (walking strand) and propelled by a strand displacement reaction. During these processes, the fluorescence of FAM on H1 was turned on (first signal), and the invertase on H2 was introduced into the surface of the MBs. After being separated by an external magnetic field, the invertase hydrolyzed sucrose into glucose to generate a second signal, which was quantified by the PGM. The developed 3D DNA walking machine showed high sensitivity and good specificity, and the detection limits of 98 pM and 60 pM were obtained for the fluorescence-based assay and PGM-based assay, respectively. Compared with the single-modal detection, the developed DNA walking machine can achieve a unique double signal readout and more reliable sensitive performance. In addition, the proposed 3D DNA walking machine was successfully applied to detect miRNA in real biological samples. The 3D DNA walking machine with dual-modal detection has potential applications in disease diagnostics and clinical applications and can satisfy different testing requirements both in the laboratory and field.",

The direct monitoring of intracellular miRNA expressional level with a wide concentration range and in ultra-low amount remains a key challenge. Herein, we report a responsive DNA \"nano wheel\" (DNW) by hybridization of modified six DNA hairpin structures to a programmed DNA nanowire for highly efficient and fast miRNA imaging in living cells. We demonstrate that one target miRNA is able to trigger the nearby DNA hairpins sequential hybridization through accelerated localized DNA cascade reaction (LDCR) along the DNA nanowire and open of the self-quenched hairpins to assemble six-arm branched junction \"nano wheel\" structure lighted with three fluorescence dye. Notably, the recycled miRNA target further acts as an catalyst to generate multiple lighted \"nano wheel\" structures, thus one target miRNA enable to trigger strong and amplified fluorescence signal for intracellular sensitive imaging. Meanwhile, the LDCR endows the system with fast reaction kinetics owing to the high local concentration. It outperforms the \"one-to-one\" conventional molecular beacon (MB) and intermolecular hybridization-based six-arm branched junction in sensitivity and reaction kinetics for intracellular miRNA imaging verified using MCF-7, A549, Hela and NHDF cells. The programmed DNW provides a useful and valuable tool for rapid and highly efficient visualization of low-abundance miRNA in living cells, which is beneficial to understand the miRNA function and explore of its biomedical application.",

Herein, we report an assembled DNA mini-hexahedron (DMH) that can selectively package and protect miRNA probe, target-cell-specific delivery and release it based on the target sequence recognition for intracellular miRNA detection. In brief, the DMH is self-assembled from six single-stranded oligonucleotide strands through rational design, one of which containing AS1411 sequence for specific uptake. Two fluorescent dye labeled recognition strands are inserted into two DMH edges with quencher groups through partially complementary hybridization. We find that this DMH possesses great biocompatibility, good trans-membrane ability and are able to protect the gene cargo against enzymatic degradation and protein binding. Fluorescence restoration caused by the target-mediated competitive chain replacement reaction allows to simultaneous detection of two cancer-related intracellular miRNAs with little false-positive signal, providing a powerful tool to discriminate healthy normal cell and cancerous cell. Thus, the construct opens a new avenue to circumvent the challenges in gene delivery, specific delivery and intrinsic interferences resistance.",

        "abstract": "An efficient three-dimensional (3D) hybrid material of nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (N-RGO) supporting molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoparticles with high-performance electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is fabricated by using a facile hydrothermal route. Comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations confirm the resulting hybrid material possesses a 3D crumpled few-layered graphene network structure decorated with MoS2 nanoparticles. Electrochemical characterization analysis reveals that the resulting hybrid material exhibits efficient electrocatalytic activity toward HER under acidic conditions with a low onset potential of 112\u2009mV and a small Tafel slope of 44\u2009mV per decade. The enhanced mechanism of electrocatalytic activity has been investigated in detail by controlling the elemental composition, electrical conductance and surface morphology of the 3D hybrid as well as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This demonstrates that the abundance of exposed active sulfur edge sites in the MoS2 and nitrogen active functional moieties in N-RGO are synergistically responsible for the catalytic activity, whilst the distinguished and coherent interface in MoS2/N-RGO facilitates the electron transfer during electrocatalysis. Our study gives insights into the physical/chemical mechanism of enhanced HER performance in MoS2/N-RGO hybrids and illustrates how to design and construct a 3D hybrid to maximize the catalytic efficiency.",

The synthesized MoS2 QDs present good down-conversion photoluminescence behavior, and exhibit remarkable up-conversion photoluminescence for bioimaging. The mechanism of the emerging photoluminescence was investigated. Furthermore, superior 1O2 production ability of MoS2 QDs to commercial photosensitizer PpIX was demonstrated, which has great potential application for photodynamic therapy. These early affording results of tunable synthesis of MoS2 QDs with desired photo properties can lead to application in fields of biomedical and optoelectronics.",

        "abstract": "Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are small-sized RNAs cleaved from precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the RNase Dicer. Various miRNAs play key regulatory roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis, and are therefore potential diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarkers. However, detecting miRNAs and pre-miRNAs accurately and selectively in living cells remains a major challenge, as the mature miRNA sequence is also present in its pre-miRNA and current sequence probes exhibit poor gene delivery efficiency. Herein, we report a strategy for selectively and accurately detecting miRNA-21 and pre-miRNA-21 in living cells using functional MoS nanosheets (NSs) loaded with rationally engineered molecular beacons (MBs). The exfoliated MoS nanosheets (NSs) with a mean lateral diameter of 50-70\u00a0nm were functionalized with the aptamer AS1411 and polyethylene glycol (MoS-PEG-AS) to achieve target-cell-specific delivery and to enhance biocompatibility. The large available surface of the MoS-PEG-AS was loaded with MB probes. The resulting MoS-PEG-AS/MBs present cancer-cell-targeting ability, good protection properties, good optical stability, and biocompatibility. We demonstrated that the resulting nanoprobes can selectively image miRNA-21 and pre-miRNA-21 in various cell lines by facilitating enhanced fluorescence in the presence of miRNA-21 and pre-miRNA-21. Thus, these MoS-PEG-AS/MBs are potentially a tool to discriminate between intracellular miRNA and pre-miRNA at different expression levels. Graphical abstract.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge of combinatorial therapy is the unification of the pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake of various drug molecules with precise control of the dosage thereby maximizing the combined effects. To realize ratiometric delivery and synchronized release of different drugs from a single carrier, a novel approach was designed in this study to load dual drugs onto the macromolecular carrier with different molar ratio by covalently preconjugating dual drugs through peptide linkers to form drug conjugates. In contrast to loading individual types of drugs separately, these drug conjugates enable the loading of dual drugs onto the same carrier in a precisely controllable manner to reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. As a proof of concept, the synthesis and characterization of xyloglucan\u2013mitomycin C/doxorubicin (XG\u2013MMC/DOX) conjugates were demonstrated. This approach enabled MMC and DOX to be conjugated to the same polymeric carrier with precise control of drug dosage. The cytotoxicity and combinatorial effects were significantly improved compared to the cocktail mixtures of XG\u2013MMC and XG\u2013DOX as well as the individual conjugate of the mixture. Moreover, the results also showed that there was an optimum ratio of dual drugs showing the best cytotoxicity effect and greatest synergy among other tested polymeric conjugate formulations.",

        "abstract": "The simultaneous introduction of green polysaccharides and low-cost inorganic clay into superabsorbent (SAP) polymeric networks has witnessed growing interest for developing eco-friendly and low-cost SAPs since the last decade. In this study, a high performance nano-hybrid SAP composite (HEC-g-PAA/diatomite) was prepared through the graft polymerization of acrylic acid into hydroxyethyl cellulose backbone chains under aqueous conditions in the presence of diatomite clay as an inorganic nano-filler, N,N\u02b9-methylenebisacrylamide as the cross-linker and ammonium persulfate as the initiator. FTIR, XRD, and SEM investigations confirmed the successful synthesis of this HEC-g-PAA/diatomite nano-hybrid SAP composite with high porosity on the surface. The composite prepared under optimized conditions presented a significantly enhanced thermal stability according to the TGA and DSC analysis and remarkably improved water-retention properties at various temperatures compared with the clay-free counterpart. Our SAP showed the eminent maximum swelling ratio of 1174.85 g g\u22121 in distilled H2O and 99.55 g g\u22121 in 0.9 wt% NaCl salt solutions. In addition, factors influencing various amounts of water absorbency of the prepared SAP were extensively determined and discussed. Therefore, this SAP, with a high content of biodegradable and low-cost material, could be a good candidate for hygienic products, waste-water treatment, agriculture, and horticulture uses.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still considered as the third highest cause of cancer death in developing countries. In our previous study, we confirmed that the galactose residues of natural polysaccharide xyloglucan (XG) turns out to be selected uptake by asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) and the xyloglucan can be used as drug carriers and achieve some enhancement in the therapeutic effect of HCC via ASGPR mediated endocytosis. In this study, we selected mitomycin C (MMC) as the anticancer model drug and a macromolecular drug delivery system (DDS) with different degrees of substitution that was synthesized by conjugating mitomycin C with xyloglucan. The degree of substitution of xyloglucan\u2013mitomycin C conjugates (XG\u2013MMC) was about 9.7%. Another sample obtained a higher degree of substitution (p-MMC) of approximately 31%. The content of MMC in XG\u2013MMC and p-MMC was determined and calculated to be about 3.1% and 6.4%, respectively. In the in vitro cytotoxicity experiment, the prodrugs presented higher cytotoxicity than free MMC against the drug resistant HepG2 cells. Moreover, the IC50 of XG\u2013MMC (0.997 \u03bcg mL\u22121) was much lower than that of p-MMC (2.56 \u03bcg mL\u22121) and XG\u2013MMC exhibited higher drug uptake amounts (187.9 ng) than that of p-MMC (63.5 ng). The in vivo cytotoxicity was also evaluated, and the result was in good agreement with the in vitro cytotoxicity experiment.",

        "abstract": "An active-targeting and smart pH-sensitive nanoparticle drug delivery system with high drug loading was developed by conjugating doxorubicin (DOX) to xyloglucan (XG) through acid-cleavable hydrazone bonds, and then encapsulating DOX by the self-assembly of xyloglucan\u2013doxorubicin conjugates (XG\u2013DOX) to ensure a sufficient amount of drug delivered in the tumor region. The galactose moiety of XG, as an ideal targeting moiety, could be recognized and internalized by asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R), which is especially ample in hepatocytes. And then the abundant DOX of xyloglucan\u2013doxorubicin nanoparticle drug delivery systems (DOX nano-DDSs) could be highly accumulated and released in drug resistant tumor cells to exert maximum therapeutic effects. Compared with free DOX, the novel DOX nano-DDSs apparently showed longer circulation time, larger intracellular uptake, more drug release, higher cytotoxicity against drug resistant HepG2 (HepG2/DOX) cells and greater effects for inhibiting the growth of the tumor volume and decreasing systemic toxicity. Even though there was no significant enhancement in intracellular uptake and cytotoxicity between the DOX nano-DDSs and XG\u2013DOX, the loading content of DOX of DOX nano-DDSs reached 23%, which is higher than that of XG\u2013DOX conjugates. Moreover, the DOX nano-DDSs obviously presented better anti-tumor effects in in vivo assays. In conclusion, these novel DOX nano-DDSs exhibited remarkable anti-tumor effects and few side effects, which is significantly promising for the clinical therapy of cancer.",

        "abstract": "So far, several anti-cancer drugs have shown low efficacy in the clinic because of multi-drug resistance (MDR), which always leads to the failure of chemotherapy. In addition, high doses of these chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX) result in high toxicity. Considering the above problems, a kind of dual drug loading onto a conjugate was designed, which makes good use of two drugs. In this new nano-drug delivery system, DOX works as a hydrophobic core and xyloglucan (XG) works as a hydrophilic shell to form stable nanoparticles in aqueous solution. Thereafter, PTX is encapsulated by this XG\u2013DOX conjugate (PTX nano-DDS). Results have demonstrated that PTX nano-DDS possesses outstanding advantages over ordinary systems, including precise control over the molar ratio of the drugs and high hepatic targeting. Moreover, through the combination of two drugs, the system can maximize efficacy through synergism between PTX and DOX. It also has minimal side effects and is effective against MDR cancer cells. This kind of system is therefore practical for development as a new type of targeted dual drug delivery system in combination therapy.",

        "abstract": "Slow release fertilizers (SRFs) are of vital importance to improve agricultural efficiency. However, their use is still limited due to their relatively high costs. Additionally, most of coating materials used to produce SRFs are nonbiodegradable and toxic to the soil. In this context, we utilized various biopolymers such as tamarind, xanthan, and guar gums together with diatomite to coat urea fertilizer granules. In this study, tamarind\u2013urea-diatomite (TUD), guar\u2013urea-diatomite (GUD), and xanthan\u2013urea-diatomite (XUD) SRF granules were prepared in the presence of epichlorohydrin as crosslinker. The nutrients slow release behavior and the water retention capacity of these SRFs in soil were determined. The water absorbency of the product was 89% TUD, 93% GUD, and 142% XUD of its own weight when it was allowed to swell in tap water at room temperature for 2\u00a0h. Poly(methacrylic acid) was applied as the outermost layer of XUD to improve the nitrogen slow release efficiency of XUD SRFs. The results showed that the product had an excellent nutrients slow release property of 79.5% and good water retention capacity of 62.9% after 28\u00a0days. This suggested that XUDM could effectively improve the utilization of fertilizer. Furthermore, being biodegradable and low cost could be beneficial in agricultural and horticultural applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract10-Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) is a clinical therapy agent against hepatoma. The chemotherapy of HCPT is strongly obstructed by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR), serious systemic toxicity, malfunction of rapid phagocytic and renal clearance disorder which are undesirable for its chemotherapy. In this paper, a drug delivery system (DDS) for HCPT has been developed in order to overcome MDR. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) coated with xyloglucan (XG) was prepared by soya oil and XG consisting of side chains with galactose residues, a terminal moiety that can be used to target HCPT to hepatoma. The therapeutic potential of XG-NLC/HCPT was investigated on HepG2/HCPT cells and on human tumor xenograft nude mouse model (implanted with HepG2/HCPT cells). XG-NLC/HCPT not only indicated superior cytotoxicity against the drug resistant HepG2 cells but also in vivo, generated a higher therapeutic effect. Systemic toxicity study demonstrated that the carrier reduced systemic toxicity. XG-NLC/HCPT...",

The results showed that in study area, the NPP decreased gradually from valley to ridge, which was accorded with the gradients of precipitation and temperature.

        "abstract": "Risk assessment beginning at 1980s has developed greatly in content, scale and methods of assessment from one chemical and one receptor to its current application at large spatial and temporal scales in the 20 years. In the 1980s, the main assessment content was from toxicity of one chemical to human health risk. In the 1990s, risk assessment as a management tool had to be applied to populations, communities, and eventually to the ecological landscape at large scales. The risk analysis of multiple stressors, not just multiple chemicals but multiple types of agents, was also taken into account. During the late part of 1990s and early 2000s, the ecological risk assessment was broadening to include not only chemicals and ecological affairs but also a wide variety stressors, such as the impacts of human activities(urbanization, land use and land cover change, fishery and climate change, etc.) and the assessment scale was expanding to region and landscape scales. Frameworks and statistical models are the key of regional ecological risk assessment. The risk assessment framework presented in the National Research Council(NRC) Red Book played a key role in the development of ecological risk assessment. After years of modification, the assessment framework had been improved to be perfect till 1998. The Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) framework proposed an integrated framework that covered both human health and ecological risk assessment including a detailed description of the process and showing how the process could be applied to a broad range of situations. Since then, various ERA framework have been developed for use in some countries(e.g. Netherlands, Australia, United Kingdom) and for specific situations. The statistical methods are the quantitative methods of ecological risk assessment. For one chemical stressor, the ratio value model and exposure-response model are adopted, but for the multiple stressors, multiple receptors, large scale of complex regional landscape, the methods aren't suitable because many uncertainties will appear during the extending from one stressor small scale to multiple stressors large scale. In the regional ecological risk assessment, Relative Risk Assessment(RRA) based on weight-of-evidence(WOE) are used widely. WOE approaches reported in the literature vary broadly from subjective and qualitative to quantitative and the categories of which include qualitative combination, expert ranking, consensus ranking, semi-quantitative ranking and sediment quality triad. WOE approaches could be used in retrospect assessment, causation assessment and the whole process of ecological risk assessment. In the future, as a universal framework for ecological management, ecological risk assessment should develop deeply in resolving the problems of scale extending, uncertainty and assessment standard. At the background of global ecological crisis, regional ecological risk assessment will emphasized the fields and aspects in close relationship with global changes, such as human activities, geological disasters and climate affairs and ecological risk resulting from policy error and ecology safety, etc. Regional ecological risk assessment has the potential of becoming quantitative tools of management decision if it integrated with economy, society and culture.",

        "abstract": "Study on landscape ecological classification is the basis for understanding landscape patterns and ecological functions in landscape ecology.And the application of remote sensing for classifying landscape ecological types was one of the most important methods in landscape ecology all along.For finding a way to enhance the ability of landscape ecological classification,this study will try using different vegetation indices and other band ratio indices to join the classification process.In this paper,with remote sensing and GIS techniques,Ejin natural oasis landscape ecological classification was carried out using Landsat7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data in 2001.Firstly,remote sensing image data preparation was done based on image masking,geometric correction and radiometric correction.Then,according to Ejin natural oasis landscape ecological classification system,unsupervised classification,vegetation indices and band ratio indices clustering,supervised classification and landscape types overlaying and integrating,orderly,were executed to interpret and classify the map of classification of Ejin natural oasis landscape in 2001.In order to use all the bands of original remote sensing image data,five vegetation indices such as NDVI,DVI,RVI,IPVI,SAVI and nine band ratio indices such as Index1,Index2,...,Index9 were selected to participate in the interpretation of landscape ecological types.Results show that,NDVI,DVI,IPVI,SAVI,RVI,Index5 and Index6,with similar characte-ristics,can obviously separate landscape types with vegetation ingredients.Index1 to Index4 have better spatial separability and can easily identify different landscape types.For Index7,Index8 and Index9,owing to their worse spatial separability,they can difficultly differentiate landscape types.In conclusion,during the processes of landscape ecological classification based on remote sensing image data,more vegetation indices assisting can not only find new information,but can also clearly enhance the ability of interpretation and classification of landscape ecological types,especially for those oasis landscapes in arid regions.",

        "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, is critical to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fuzheng Quxie Decoction (FQD), a Chinese herbal complex, is an effective clinical formula used to treat AD. In the current study, we employed high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify the components of FQD. Three major components (ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Re, and coptisine) were detected in the brain of FQD-fed mice, indicating their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. We further evaluated the efficacy of FQD on Senescence-Accelerated Mice Prone-8 (SAMP8) mice. FQD significantly ameliorated learning and memory deficits in SAMP8 mice on the Morris Water Maze, decreasing escape latency ( < 0.01) and increasing swim time within the original platform-containing quadrant ( < 0.05). Further, FQD increased the number of neurons and intraneuronal Nissl bodies in the hippocampal CA1 region. FQD also decreased the expression of phosphorylated tau protein and increased the expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit, NR2A ( < 0.01). Our results indicate that FQD improves the learning and memory ability of SAMP8 mice. Moreover, our findings suggest that the protective effect of FQD is likely mediated through an inhibition of hippocampal tau hyperphosphorylation via NMDAR/PP2A-associated proteins.",

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be determined. . Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally and randomly into five different groups including control, positive control, and HYD granules of low dose, medium dose, and high dose by daily gavage. The sham-treated rats were also given the same volume of sterile water by gavage. Twelve SD rats were treated with the same amount of physiological saline. Twelve weeks later, learning and memory capabilities, A content of the right brain and the expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), total tau protein kinase (TTBK1), and cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK-5) were tested. . Our results showed that high dose HYD treatment significantly improved the learning and memory capability of the AD rats and decreased the expression of TTBK1, GSK-3, and CDK-5 in the hippocampal CA1 region. . HYD treatment for 12 weeks significantly improved spatial learning and memory and effectively inhibited A deposition, likely via reducing tau protein kinase expression and thus tau hyperphosphorylation and inflammatory injury. Taken together, these results suggest that HYD could be an effective treatment for AD.",

        "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, memory loss, and thinking or speech problems. VaD is usually caused by cerebrovascular disease, during which, cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CECs) are vulnerable. CEC dysfunction occurs before the onset of VaD and can eventually lead to dysregulation of cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier damage, followed by the activation of glia and inflammatory environment in the brain. White matter, neuronal axons, and synapses are compromised in this process, leading to cognitive impairment. The present review summarizes the mechanisms underlying CEC impairment during hypoperfusion and pathological role of CECs in VaD. Through the comprehensive examination and summarization, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) signaling pathway, and CEC-derived caveolin-1 (CAV-1) are proposed to serve as targets of new drugs for the treatment of VaD.",

Based on the history, current status, and latest progress in the studies on the theories, indicators, and methods of wetland landscape classification, some scientific wetland classification systems, e. g., NWI, Ramsar, and HGM, were introduced and discussed in this paper. It was suggested that a comprehensive classification method based on HGM and on the integral consideration of wetlands spatial structure, ecological function, ecological process, topography, soil, vegetation, hydrology, and human disturbance intensity should be the major future direction in this research field. Furthermore, the integration of 3S technologies, quantitative mathematics, landscape modeling, knowledge engineering, and artificial intelligence to enhance the automatization and precision of wetland landscape ecological classification would be the key issues and difficult topics in the studies of wetland landscape ecological classification.",

        "abstract": "Based on data of Landsat TM imagery and the Feature Extraction module of ENVI EX software,object-oriented method was applied to the remote sensing image classification of wetlands in southern Hangzhou Bay area.And analytical comparisons of object-oriented classification and traditional pixel-based methods(maximum likelihood method,artificial neural net method and support vector machines method) were conducted on the basis of the classification results in order to systematically assess the utility of object-oriented classification of wetlands with medium and low resolution satellite imagery.The research showed that compared with the traditional classification methods which only consider the spectral characteristics of the targets,object-oriented classification comprehensively utilizes more detailed information of the remote sensing imagery(e.g.,spectral characteristics,texture feature,spatial relationship,color space,band ration).Thus,it gains a better discriminability for some specific wetland landscapes(e.g.,intertidal mud,lake wetlands,river wetlands),which involve complex forms,fuzzy boundaries,and severe spectral and pixel mixed problems,and yields higher classification accuracy(an overall accuracy of 88.80% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.876 5 were achieved in this study).Object-oriented method extracts the so called 'object' which consists of some homogeneous pixels in the process of classification,and the objects show a low degree of fragmentation through a reasonable level of image segmentation.Therefore,this method significantly reduces the disturbance of salt-and-pepper noise in the classification results and generates more accurate results.In contrast,the landscapes extracted by pixel-based methods are made up of discrete pixels,fall short of representing the shapes and boundaries of the targets clearly,and also fail to block out the noise phenomena.It is found that image segmentation plays an essential role in the process of object-oriented classification,and 60% is a proper parameter of segmentation and merger scale for the object-oriented classification of medium and low resolution satellite imagery.Furthermore,the Feature Extraction module of ENVI EX enables a preview of the results of image segmentation real-time as a good approach for image segmentation,one that is more convenient and effective than other comparable softwares.Some important scientific issues existing in the process of object-oriented classification,e.g.,the evaluation of image segmentation precision,the identification of optimal segmentation scale,the optimization of feature space,entail further research.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study to use the metallic three dimensional (3-D) printing technology for antenna implementations up to 325\u00a0GHz. Two different printing technologies and materials are used, namely binder jetting/sintering on 316L stainless steel and selective laser melting (SLM) on Cu\u201315Sn. Phases, microstructure, and surface roughness are investigated on different materials. Balancing between the cost and performance, the manually polished Cu\u201315Sn is selected to develop a series of conical horn antennas at the E-(60\u201390\u00a0GHz), D- (110\u2013170\u00a0GHz), and H-band (220\u2013325\u00a0GHz). Good agreement is observed between the simulated and measured antenna performance. The antennas\u2019 impedance bandwidth (   $vert S_{11}vert   ) cover the whole operational band, with in-band gain of u003e22.5, u003e22, and u003e21.5\u00a0dBi for the E-, D-, and H-band antennas, respectively. Compared with the traditional injection molding and micromachining for metallic horn antenna implementation, the 3-D printed metallic horn antenna features environmental friendliness, low cost, and short turn-around time. Compared with the nonmetallic 3-D printed antennas, they feature process simplicity and mechanical robustness. It proves great potential of the metallic 3-D printing technology for both industrial mass production and prototyping.",

Ultraviolet/ozone (UVO) treatment is a convenient, highly effective, vacuum process and post-clean free method. This paper reveals that the effect of UVO treatment on the resistance of graphene is substrate dependent, which means that the band gap and photogenerated charge carriers of the substrates under UV illumination play a key role in the doping effect. The resistance of graphene can be decreased by as much as 80% on F8BT, GaN and PTFE substrates, by 70% on PMMA substrate, and by 50% on paraffin and glass substrates. Large band gap substrates (u003eh\u03bd) will induce a p-doping effect, while small band gap substrates (u003ch\u03bd) with plenty of photogenerated free charge carriers will induce n-doping effect. This approach will have great impact on the practical application of graphene in electronic and optoelectronic device fabrication.",

        "abstract": "The effort to integrate emotions into human-computer interaction (HCI) system has attracted broad attentions. Automatic emotion recognition enables the HCI to become more intelligent and user friendly. Although numerous studies have been performed in this field, emotion recognition is still an extremely challenging task, especially in real-world practice usage. In this work, probabilistic neural network (PNN), with advantage of simple, efficient, and easy to train, was employed to recognize emotions elicited by watching music videos from scalp EEG. The publicly available DEAP emotion database was used to validate our algorithms. The powers of 4 frequency bands of EEG were extracted as features. The results show that the mean classification accuracy of PNN is 81.21% for valence(\u22655 and u003c5) and 81.26% for arousal(\u22655 and u003c5) across 32 subjects, similar with the results of SVM. In addition, they demonstrate that higher frequency bands (beta and gamma) play more important role in emotion classification than lower ones (theta and alpha). For the purpose of practical emotion recognition system, we proposed a ReliefF-based channel selection algorithm to reduce the number of used channels for convenience in practical usage. The results show that while using PNN, the 98% of the maximum classification accuracy can be obtained with only 9 (for valence) and 8 (for arousal) best channels, however, 19 (for valence) and 14 (for arousal) channels are needed while using SVM.",

EEG signals were recorded while a subject was playing video-games. Results show that fatiguing phenomenon was observed in 15 subjects using NC in [20, 30] Hz while only 13 subjects were identified with GC for comparison. The NC further showed the bi-directional causality changes between the two hemispheres during unilateral forearm movements. We noticed that half of the subjects had predominant active hemisphere while the other half showed the opposite, especially to the ones with higher fatigue level. The findings demonstrate that the NC method is better than the GC to reveal causal influence between homologous motor areas of active and inactive hemispheres in this study.",

        "abstract": "In 2011 [1] we proposed new causality (NC) method and demonstrated that NC method much better reveals true causality of time-invariant bivariate autoregressive model than the popular Granger causality (GC) method by several examples. In this paper, we provide more evidence that GC cannot reveal true causality, and point out the core difference between GC and NC mathematically. Given a jointly regression model in GC method one has to estimate the autoregressive model. By an illustrative example on one hand we give the exact formula for GC, which is only related to some coefficients and has nothing to do with the other coefficients, and thus GC cannot reveal true causality at all since true causality underlying the joint regression model with different time-invariant coefficients surely be different. On the other hand, we theoretically show a fatal drawback that the estimation of the autoregressive model is equivalent to taking a series of backward recursive operations, which are infeasible however for many irreversible chemical reaction models. Thus, GC method cannot be applied at all. In this case GC value by forcibly estimating the auto regressive model (i.e., taking a series of backward recursive operations) inevitably cannot reveal true causality.",

        "abstract": "Causal interaction between different brain regions has received wide attention recently. Granger causality (GC) is one of the most popular methods to explore causality relationship between different brain regions. New causality (NC) proposed by Hu et. al was shown to be better reveal true causality than GC. In this paper based on scalp EEGs from 6 groups subjects we apply GC and NC methods to study shared intentionality which is an important mental process in cognitive neuroscience and psychology. We are interested in nine regions: F3 (left area of the frontal cortex), Fz (central area of the frontal cortex), F4 (right area of the frontal cortex), C3 (left area of the central cortex), Cz (central area of the central cortex), C4 (right area of the central cortex), P3 (left area of the parietal cortex), Pz (central area of the parietal cortex), P4 (right area of the parietal cortex) which are considered to be optimal locations for observing whether the scalp EEGs can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function. Our findings show that i) there exists obvious stronger causal influence from F3/Fz/F4/Cz/C4/P3/Pz/P4 to C3 in 8 \u223c 13Hz rhythm than that from C3 to F3/Fz/F4/Cz/C4/P3/Pz/P4 for three states (eyes open+finger movement, eyes wandering+finger movement, and eyes close+finger movement) during shared intentionality. ii) NC method can better reveal real causal influence in 8 \u223c 13Hz rhythm than GC method during three states.",

        "abstract": "Carbon stabilized expanded austenite (S-phase) is prepared by commercial low-temperature carburizing process(LTC) on austenitic stainless steels AISI 304L and AISI 904L. The current paper deals with the material response to LTC and thermal stability of the formed metastable structure. The aim is to investigate the influence of the alloy composition and surface finishing as well as thermal annealing on the microstructure, phase constituents andhardness of the modified layer by means of combined analysis techniques. It has been found that the formationof expanded austenite is accompanied by Hagg carbides on as-carburized 304L. However, the highly alloyed 904Lexhibits mainly S-phase with larger degree of lattice expansion after carburizing. S-phase has proven to be morestable in 904L, whereas residual and/or induced ferrite/martensite in 304L makes the formation of S-phase less favourable. LTC induces significant enhancement of surface hardness, more effectively on 904L.The hardening mechanism is discussed. In order to evaluate the phase evolution and stability of the expanded austenite at elevated temperatures, annealing has been performed in vacuum at temperature of 600\u00b0C for 150 hours.The decomposition of S-phase and the related microstructure evolution give rise to reduced hardening effect and declined corrosion resistance in both S-phase layer and the region below.",

The current investigation focuses on the assessment of the thermal stability and related phase evolution of the expanded austenite layer during isothermal annealing in protective argon atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 450 to 600\u00b0C for 24 and 168 h. Characterisation of the original expanded austenite and the decomposed surface layers was performed. Denitriding, inward N-diffusion and Cr-compounds precipitation occurred at different extent, depending on annealing conditions and alloy composition. Expanded austenite in 304L exhibited a near complete eutectoid decomposition after a short annealing time, while 904L showed significantly better thermal stability. A fine dispersion of small CrN precipitates resulting from expanded austenite decomposition at relatively low annealing temperature or short duration could further positively affect the surface har...",

        "title": "Understanding the microstructure-properties relationship of low-temperature carburized austenitic stainless steels through EBSD analysis",
        "abstract": "The present article is dedicated to the microstructural characterization of the surface layer of two different austenitic stainless steels, 304L and 904L, subjected to a low-temperature carburizing process (Kolsterising\u00ae,Bodycote) and a subsequent annealing at high-temperature. The carburizing treatment forms a hard expanded austenite in both materials. However, thermal decomposition occurs at high temperatures through precipitation of chromium-carbides, hence compromising the surface hardness of the treated materials.The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential applicability of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique to reveal the correlation between phase transformation and hardness. First of all, EBSD was used to create kernel average misorientation (KAM) maps of the modified surface layers to identify the internal strains. Moreover,the preferential sites for precipitation of chromium-compound during annealing were identified. We provehere that EBSD can provide useful information to distinguish the main hardening mechanisms within modifiedsurface layers at different annealing conditions. When combined with nano-indentation, X-ray diffraction(XRD) and glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GDOES), an effective bridge between macro and microanalysis can be obtained. Solid solution hardening was found to be the dominant mechanismin as-carburized materials, with pre-existing strain promoting a higher supersaturation. In the annealed materials, the alloy composition and surface finish can also dictate the preferential sites of precipitation and can therefore affect the residual hardening.",

        "abstract": "In present study, Cu-Al2O3 composites with both higher micro-hardness and electrical conductivity were fabricated by internal-oxidizing Cu-Al and Cu-Al-Ag sheets at 950 degrees C for 2 h. A small amount of Ag was doped as additives with atomic ratio of Ag/Al ranging from 0 to 0.25. Effects of Ag addition on microstructures, electrical conductivity and micro-hardness were investigated. Results show that the morphology and size distribution of Al2O3 in internal-oxidized Cu-Al alloys were highly sensitive to Ag addition. The size of Al2O3 precipitates decreased from similar to 63 nm to similar to 37 nm when increasing Ag content. Moreover, a large number of triangular Al2O3 precipitate with similar size was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Ag-doped Cu-Al2O3 composites. The orientation relationship between triangular Al2O3 and Cu matrix was [112](Cu)//[110](Al2O3), (11 (1) over bar)(Cu)//(002)(Al2O3) and (2 (2) over bar 0)(Cu)//(2 (2) over bar 0)(Al2O3). Increasing the amount of Ag enhances the electrical conductivity and mechanical strength simultaneously. The optimal electrical and mechanical properties which were 85.9% IACS and 162 HV respectively, were obtained when atomic ratio of Ag/Al was similar to 1: 4 in internal-oxidized Cu- Al2O3-Ag alloy.",

        "abstract": "The inflammation-based Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), which involves C-reactive protein and serum albumin levels, has been reported to be a strong independent predictor of mortality in many cancers. This study aimed to investigate whether the GPS is associated with mortality in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).In this study, 406 consecutive patients with STEMI at our emergency department (ED) who were undergoing pPCI were prospectively enrolled and assigned a GPS of 0, 1, or 2. Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations between the GPS and long-term mortality.Twenty-three patients (5.7%) died at the hospital, and 37 (9.7%) died during follow-up (14.4 [9.3-17.6] months). Compared with patients with a lower GPS, those with a higher GPS had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (GPS\u200a=\u200a0 vs GPS\u200a=\u200a1 vs GPS\u200a=\u200a2: 3.3% vs 6.3% vs 28.0%, P\u200a<\u200a.001), follow-up mortality (4.6% vs 14.3% vs 55.6%, P\u200a<\u200a.001), and cumulative mortality (9.6% vs 21.1% vs 71.1%, P\u200a<\u200a.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that in patients with a GPS of 1 and 2 (versus 0), the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality were 2.068 (95% CI: 1.082-3.951, P\u200a=\u200a.028) and 8.305 (95% CI: 4.017-17.171, P\u200a<\u200a.001), respectively, after controlling for all of the confounding factors. Subgroup analysis showed that a higher GPS was associated with an increased risk of cumulative mortality in the different subgroups.The GPS on admission may be useful for stratifying the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI in the ED.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to summarize the overall diagnostic performance of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in cerebrospinal fluid for bacterial meningitis through meta-analysis due to inconclusive results reported. Literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase to identify eligible studies. Data were retrieved and sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio/negative likelihood ratio (PLR/NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled. Summary receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate their overall test performances. Thirteen studies were included for present meta-analysis. The summary estimates for interleukin-6 in diagnosing bacterial meningitis were: sensitivity, 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-0.96); specificity, 0.93 (95% CI 0.84-0.97); PLR, 12.38 (95% CI 5.42-28.29); NLR, 0.10 (95% CI 0.04-0.21); DOR, 129.76 (95% CI 41.48-405.88); and AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98). The corresponding summary performance estimates for interleukin-8 were as follows: sensitivity, 0.95 (95% CI 0.71-0.99); specificity, 0.89 (95% CI 0.77-0.95); PLR, 8.50 (95% CI, 3.83-18.86); NLR, 0.06 (95% CI 0.01-0.40); DOR, 154.25 (95% CI 14.56-1634.33); and AUC 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.97). Measurements of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 play a valuable role in diagnosing bacterial meningitis. Nevertheless, their results should be interpreted in parallel with the results of routine tests and clinical symptoms. ",

        "abstract": "Post\u2011resuscitation myocardial dysfunction (PRMD) is a severe complication that arises in patients after cardiac arrest (CA). However, there are no safe or effective treatment strategies that are currently available to treat these patients. In the present study, it was investigated whether resveratrol administration could inhibit myocardial nitrative stress to alleviate PRMD. CA was induced in Sprague\u2011Dawley rats by trans\u2011oesophageal alternating electrical stimulation, followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Rats were then randomly divided into a preconditioning or a postconditioning group. Left ventricular function (+dP/dtmax and \u2011dP/dtmin) was recorded for 4\u00a0h after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), after which the animals were euthanized. Myocardial nitrative stress was analysed using enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) was used to investigate the involvement of the PI3k/Akt signalling pathway in the cardio\u2011protective activity of resveratrol. After ROSC, resveratrol improved PRMD compared to the vehicle control; however, resveratrol administration significantly improved PRMD in the preconditioning group compared to the postconditioning group. Likewise, resveratrol preconditioning significantly decreased the expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine in rat hearts but did not significantly ameliorate myocardial nitrative stress. Wortmannin partially inhibited the protective effect of resveratrol preconditioning and resulted in the deterioration of cardiac function and increase in iNOS and nitrotyrosine levels. Resveratrol preconditioning could alleviate PRMD by inhibiting myocardial nitrative stress. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway may be partially involved in the process.",

The aim of the meta-analysis was to investigate the association between Lp-PLA2 and prognosis of CHD.    Methods  PubMed and Embase were examined for prospective studies published before June 2016. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of adverse outcomes according to Lp-PLA2 activity or mass were extracted, pooled, and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling.    Results  Fifteen studies with 30,857 participants were included. Overall, higher Lp-PLA2 activity or mass was not significantly related to increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality. However, higher Lp-PLA2 activity or mass was independently associated with an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular events, with pooled HR for cardiovascular events of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.08\u20132.23;  P \u00a0=\u00a00.018) and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.09\u20132.41;  P \u00a0=\u00a00.017), respectively. The prognostic value of Lp-PLA2 in predicting cardiovascular events was observed in patients with stable CHD who were not receiving therapies for inhibiting Lp-PLA2.    Conclusions  Greater Lp-PLA2 activity or mass was independently associated with cardiovascular events in patients with CHD, particularly in patients with stable CHD who were not receiving therapies for inhibiting Lp-PLA2.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  This study investigated the associations between lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke (IS) in the general population.    Methods  PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for prospective cohort studies published prior to June 2016. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CHD and IS risks according to Lp-PLA2 activity or mass were extracted, pooled, and weighted using random-effects modeling.    Results  Twelve studies examining Lp-PLA2 activity or mass and long-term risks of CHD and IS were included. Combined HRs for CHD and IS risks for the highest category referring to lowest category of Lp-PLA2 were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.20\u20131.78,  P  P \u00a0=\u00a00.001), respectively. The same patterns were observed for both mass and activity, with the exception of those for CHD. For every 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in Lp-PLA2 activity, CHD risk increased by 12% (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05\u20131.22,  P \u00a0=\u00a00.002); no association between 1-SD increases in Lp-PLA2 activity and IS was observed. Lp-PLA2 mass was associated with CHD risk (HR: 1.02\u20131.24, 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.24,  P \u00a0=\u00a00.021). Lp-PLA2 mass per 1-SD increase was not associated with IS risk.    Conclusions  Greater Lp-PLA2 activity or mass was associated with an increased risk of CHD and IS; however, additional well-designed trials are warranted to confirm this association.",

We present 3 cases of stings and discuss the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) and a simple tool to assess the severity of such injuries. A 34-year-old man, who worked as an aquarium keeper, presented a wound on the left fifth digit caused by a stingray. Acute myocardial injury and rhabdomyolysis were detected. After 6weeks, the wound had almost healed. A 27-year-old man who experienced a stingray injury on the left second digit recovered without sequelae after 5weeks. A 45-year-old man with a history of diabetes, who was accidentally stung in the right palm by a stingray, experienced rhabdomyolysis and returned to work after 2months. We performed debridement, administered the tetanus toxoid and antibiotics, and immersed the wounded hand in warm water (about 43\u00b0C) for all three cases. Meanwhile, patients with rhabdomyolysis were administered intravenous hydration. Upon presentation at the emergency department, we recorded the severity of the injury by using PSS. We found that relatively high PSSs were associated with lower platelet counts that happen due to various adverse events. We suggest that dynamic changes in platelet counts may be associated with the severity of the injury. Furthermore, lower platelet counts in the normal or abnormal range may indicate poor prognoses.",

The results indicated that fine FeTiP could precipitate at 650\u00a0\u00b0C, and the number of those precipitates increased greatly with the increasing annealing temperature until 800\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, the nucleation of FeTiP was influenced by the precipitation of TiC and (Ti, Nb) C. The near absence of FeTiP and a large volume fraction of TiC and (Ti, Nb) C in matrix are envisaged to be primarily responsible for the sharp \u03b3-fiber texture. As the boundary pinning effect caused by FeTiP is weak and there are less interstitial C atoms in matrix. Thus, annealing at 800\u00a0\u00b0C leads to the highest intensity of \u03b3-fiber texture.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Two types of hot compression tests, namely, constant strain rate and strain rate jump, were carried out for Alloy 800\u202fH within a wide temperature range of 450\u2013900\u202f\u00b0C and strain rate range of 0.001\u20131\u202fs \u22121 . Following the above tests, we studied the effect of dynamic strain aging (DSA) on the mechanical properties and microstructure features to reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for DSA. The results indicated that three kinds of serrated yielding behavior (Type A, B and C) can be observed in the stress-strain curves of the DSA regime. The DSA temperature ( T  DSA ) is located in the temperature range of 500\u2013750\u202f\u00b0C at a strain rate of 0.001\u202fs \u22121 , in 550\u2013790\u202f\u00b0C at 0.01\u202fs \u22121 , and in 600\u2013840\u202f\u00b0C at 0.1\u202fs \u22121 . The activation energy for the appearance of negative strain rate sensitivity was calculated to be 194\u202fkJ/mol, and pipe diffusion of substitutional solutes (i.e. Cr, Ni and Ti) is regarded as the mechanism of DSA. TEM observations further elucidated a tendency of linear microstructure within the DSA regime, which also restricts the cross-slip of dislocations and promotes the strain localization along deformation bands.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, we have implemented a specific hot rolling and solution treatments on Incoloy 800H to examine the evolution of texture and microstructure during this process. We also focused on the analysis of local misorientation (LM) and grain boundary character distribution through electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) method. The results showed that the hot-rolled microstructure is mainly composed of elongated grains with typical texture components of B, Cu and S at the mid-layer of plates, while substantial inhomogeneous fine grains can be observed between the deformation grains at the surface-layer showing a combination of R-C and R-Cu components. Following solution treatment, the original deformed grains are fully substituted by the fine recrystallized grains and the grain size increases significantly at higher solution temperatures. An alternant lamellar structure of fine and coarse grains forms along the rolling direction at 1050\u00a0\u00b0C due to the pinning effect of TiC at fine grains boundaries. Besides, C and G are the dominant texture components after solution treatment. With increasing solution temperature, the overall level of LM and micro-hardness decrease stably and a higher ratio of \u03a33:\u03a3(9\u00a0+\u00a027) indicates that \u03a33  n   boundaries proliferation mechanism transforms from \u201c\u03a33 regeneration\u201d to \u201cnew twinning\u201d.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The similar and dissimilar aluminum alloys (5\u2009mm thick AA7075-T651 and AA2024-T351) joints were performed by friction stir welding to assess the influence of rotational speed (600, 950, 1300 and 1650\u2009rpm) on the microstructure features, materials flow and mechanical properties of the joints. The results indicated that the width of the thermos-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) on the retreating side (RS) is greater than that of the advancing side (AS). Increasing the rotational speed results in widening the TMAZ on the AS and RS. The mixing degree in the joints is remarkably affected by the rotational speed. Low rotational speed leads to a limited materials mixing, while the typical onion ring of mixing pattern can be acquired at the high rotational speed. Compared to the base materials, significant grain refinement (average grain size: 1.7\u2009\u03bcm) occurs in all the joints at a rotational speed of 600\u2009rpm. Increasing the rotational speed is prone to result in grain coarsening. The crystallographic texture in the nugget zone of all the joints is dominated by a simple shear texture and varies with the rotational speed. The hardness values of all the joints almost increase and then decrease from the top to the bottom along the welding center thickness direction. The tensile fracture locations coincide with that of minimum hardness values in all the joints at various rotational speeds.",

The ZIF-8/CS spheres have been synthesized according to the assembly method, which exhibited honeycomb internal structures and micropores of 0.77\u202fnm. While the annealed ZIF-8/CS spheres exhibited obvious mesopores with a BET surface area of 626.85\u202fm 2  g \u22121  and maintained the honeycomb internal structures, which were obtained by calcinations in the tube furnace under nitrogen protection at 500\u202f\u00b0C for four hours. The annealed ZIF-8/CS spheres exhibited hierarchical porous with macropores, micropores and mesopores after annealing process. The SEM image and the XRD pattern of annealed ZIF-8/CS spheres suggested the maintenance of shape and crystal structure of ZIF-8, indicated that the annealed ZIF-8/CS spheres were stable and robust. Particularly, the CO 2  uptake of annealed ZIF-8/CS spheres with 500\u202f\u00b0C is 0.99\u202fmmol/g, which obvious higher than that of as-synthesized ZIF-8/CS spheres and samples annealed at 450\u202f\u00b0C, 525\u202f\u00b0C and 550\u202f\u00b0C. The enhancement of CO 2  uptake may attribute to the carbonization of CS and the enlarge micropores of ZIF-8 after annealing process. This approach could induce a simple way for industrial structuring ZIF-8-based adsorbents with improved CO 2  uptake.",

Nanosized microporous Cu-BTC particles pack to form mesopores with sizes that can be controlled (26\u201372 nm) by simply varying the synthesis temperature. This template-free and controllable strategy can be applied using other organic solvents to obtain mesoMOF materials that possess similar tunable mesopores. Furthermore, the as-synthesized hierarchically porous MOFs materials are demonstrated as the electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction under mild conditions.",

To predict this behavior, the conventional method requires iterative simulations to track the elevated degradation rate, which is expensive in computation. In this paper, a compact model is derived for accelerated aging. By analyzing the underlying mechanism, the new model connects the degradation rate with both reliability physics and circuit topology. It is compatible with circuit simulation, general for design conditions, and efficient in long-term prediction. The new model is validated by silicon data at 65nm, 28nm, and 16/14nm technologies, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness. Furthermore, it is applied to several benchmark circuits to illustrate the importance of accelerated aging.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Reliability modeling and analysis today lacks a robust method to directly validate the lifetime of devices and circuits. As aging mechanisms are usually gradual, i.e., a slow process, conventional aging analysis relies on the extrapolation from a short-term measurement, resulting in unreliable prediction of End of Life (EOL). Such situations are exacerbated at scaled technology nodes at high temperatures where Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), a more gradual and stochastic mechanism, dominates aging compared to Hot Carrier Injection (HCI). To improve the robustness of aging modeling, this work proposes a new approach to adaptively stress the device to EOL in an accelerated and controllable manner. It enables us to monitor the entire process of degradation and validate related analysis tools. The contributions of this paper include: (1) development of a closed-loop test methodology, Adaptive Accelerated Aging (AAA), that effectively accelerates the degradation, (2) application of AAA on 28\u00a0nm high-k/metal gate (HKMG) devices, proving the feasibility of controllable stress to EOL within 1\u00a0h, and (3) demonstration of AAA at the circuit level using ring oscillators (ROs).",

These defects can be pre-existing defects (PEDs) as well as the stress induced defects in the gate dielectric stack. The model was also used to determine the post breakdown gate current characteristics. We have verified our model with experimentally measured data from 28nm planar devices with HfSiON/SiO 2  gate dielectric layer. In addition, we have integrated the Buttiker probe method and percolation model [3] to predict the time to failure (t BD ) of the device.

The effects of laser power, scanning speed, thickness of foaming layer and ice layer on laser deicing were studied and the results showed that the removal of ice accretion could be achieved with scanning speed of 10 \u223c 20mm/s and laser power ranging from 1000 to 2000W. Ice accretions with the thickness from 3 to 7mm were successfully removed with no damage or negligible damage to the substrate surface, which validated the feasibility of this new LIBER-based deicing method that would have significant applications to the actual deicing scenarios of power grid.",

Self-assembling of shape tunable air bubbles was achieved on the designated surface with hybrid superhydrophobic/-philic (SH/SHL) patterns that fabricated by the second selective laser texturing of the prepared superhydrophobic plate. Different load-bearing capacities were obtained by changing the position and area of the SH surfaces, and an outstanding weight loading capacity of 7.5 g on a 20 cm2 aluminum alloy plate (3750 g/m2, 1.34 times the self-weight) was gained with strip-shaped air bubbles adhered to the sample bottom surface. The drag reduction characteristics SH/SHL surface with adhered air bubbles in different shapes were tested by a self-built single pendulum impact evaluation method, which indicated the sample with whole exterior SH surface achieved the longest sailing distance, which is 26.7% increased than that of the untreated bare sample. The result implies a promising strategy to increase load-bearing capacity and voyage of the marine vehicles by the manipulation of the underwater solid/air/liquid interaction on bio-mimic functional surfaces, which can be manufactured by the agile selective laser texturing technology.",

However, the long lead time and transience hindered its in-depth development and industrial application. In this work, nanosecond laser ablation was carried out to construct grid of micro-grooves on copper surface, whereafter, by applying fast ethanol assisted low-temperature annealing, we obtained surface with superhydrophobicity and ultrahigh adhesion within hours. And the ultrahigh adhesion force was found tunable by varying the groove spacing. Using ultrasonic cleaning as the simulation of natural wear and tear in service, the renewability of superhydrophobicity was also investigated, and the result shows that the contact angle can rehabilitate promptly by the processing of ethanol assisted low-temperature annealing, which gives a promising fast and cheap circuitous strategy to realize the long wish durable metallic superhydrophobic surfaces in practical applications.",

This is an enduring goal in the maritime industries, such as shipping, offshore oil exploration, and aquaculture. Recently, research of the relationship between wettability and antifouling effectiveness has attracted considerable attention, due to the anti-biofouling properties of the lotus leaf and shark skin. In this study, super-hydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) with controllable periodic structures were fabricated on AISI304 stainless steel by a picosecond laser, and their anti-biofouling performance were investigated by seawater immersion for five weeks in summertime. The results showed that the specimens with SHS demonstrate significant anti-biofouling effect as compared with the bare stainless steel plate. We observed that nearly 50% decrease of the average microbe attachment area ratio (Avg. MAAR) could be obtained. The micro-groove SHS with more abundant hierarchical micro-nano structures showed better anti-biofouling performance than the micro-pit SHS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Underwater acoustic absorption metasurfaces (UAAMs), featured with artificial periodic unit cells as acoustic micro-absorbers, are crucial for the enhancement of the underwater stealth, energy transition, sonar detection, etc. How to implement the acoustic metasurfaces for practical engineering applications requires the support of efficient manufacturing techniques. Here we present a simple way of laser texturing for fabrication of the patterned superhydrophobic surface on glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP). Unlike the traditional acoustic absorbing material whose thickness should match the corresponding wavelength, the laser textured superhydrophobic micro-grooves have thickness less than the absorption sound wavelength by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude but promisingly demonstrate over 88% of the underwater incident acoustic power absorption from 50\u202fkHz to 250\u202fkHz. The physical mechanism of the UAAM ascribes to the multiple interface scattering effect induced by the air layer between water and superhydrophobic micro-nano structures.",

Surface morphology is a key factor to determine the wettability of a solid surface, and patterning is one of the effective ways to change the surface morphology and to improve the wetting properties. Laser patterning using a pulse laser source is a unique technique that can modify the surface morphology with very limited distortion of the bulk material. Moreover, it is a noncontact method, and complex patterns can be created. In this paper, we summarized several typical approaches, theories and relevant applications of laser fabricated superhydrophobic surfaces.",

Self-assembling of shape tunable air bubbles was achieved on the designated surface with hybrid SH/superhydrophilic (SHL) patterns that fabricated by the second selective laser texturing of the prepared SH plate. Different load-bearing capacities were obtained by changing the position and area of SH surfaces, and an outstanding weight loading capacity of 7.5 g on a 20 cm2 aluminum alloy plate (3750 g/m2, 1.34 times the self-weight) was gained with strip-shaped air bubbles adhered to the sample bottom surface. The drag reduction characteristics of SH/SHL surfaces with different shaped air bubbles were tested by a self-built single pendulum impact device; the results indicated that the sample with the whole exterior SH surface achieved the longest sailing distance, which is 26.7% increase than ...",

In this study, picosecond laser fabricated hybrid superhydrophobic/-philic (SH/SHL) surfaces with designed patterns are successfully applied to control drop splashing on solid surfaces. Using high-speed imaging, the water drop impact behaviors on differently patterned hybrid SH/SHL surfaces were investigated. The experimental results show that the water drop splashing could be restrained greatly on patterned hybrid SH/SHL surfaces, compared with SH or SHL surfaces. On a hybrid SH/SHL surface with a 2\u202fmm diameter circular SH pattern, the drop splashing for a Weber number up to 600 (the corresponding impact velocity is 4.2\u202fm/s) can be totally suppressed. Moreover, we found that the oriented distribution of splashing can be regulated by the shape and size of SH patterns. These results suggest that patterned hybrid SH/SHL surfaces could be a practical approach to regulate or control drop splashing.",

Inspired by the biomimetic superhydrophobic surfaces that have self-cleaning, anti-fog, anti-snow and the reduced bacterial adhesion properties, we use a simple and effective technology of picosecond laser texturing for the fabrication of superhydrophobic antibacterial surface on AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel plates. The laser textured surface with micro-papillae patterns with superimposed nanostructures exhibits outstanding in-air superhydrophobic and superaerophilicity underwater, which under oscillation state resists the adhesion of 99% E. coli and 93% S. aureus and has hardly any bacterial adhesion under stationary state. The comparative experiments verify that the robust air layer and hierarchical micro-nanostructures have come together to comprise the antibacterial mechanism. The laser textured superhydrophobic surface also exhibits superior anti-corrosion and anti-destructive ability with excellent antibacterial durability especially if deep cleaning is carried out after each dipping time in the bacterial suspension, promoting its leading-edge applications in medical, food and pharmaceutical fields.",

        "abstract": "In view of the fact that the weak laser damage resistance of HfO2\u2009\u2009/\u2009\u2009SiO2 coatings at 355\u00a0nm hinders the observation of the fatigue effect, nanosecond single and multiple pulse laser damage studies on Al2O3\u2009\u2009/\u2009\u2009SiO2 high-reflective coatings were performed at 355\u00a0nm. Relative to that at the long wavelength, the fatigue effect at 355\u00a0nm is very weak and complicated. The damage probability curves and the evolution of the laser-induced damage threshold under multiple irradiations reveal that the fatigue effect is affected by both laser fluence and shot number. As the laser fluence or number of shots increases, the fatigue effect becomes more apparent. The damage morphologies induced by single and multiple irradiations both manifest as micrometer-scale pits without plasma scalding around, with the characteristics of a high defect density and high absorption coefficient. In particular, the accumulation damage mechanism at 355\u00a0nm may be reflected not only in the newly created defects but also in the modification of the coating material around the damage precursors. Thus, the coatings at 355\u00a0nm \u201cseem to\u201d have no damage growth threshold, no matter what the laser fluence is; once damage occurs, the damage site will grow sharply under subsequent pulses finally resulting in catastrophic damage.",

In this context, we described a novel photoreductive functionalization of CO2 strategy to construct new C-C, C-N and C-O bond going through the respective palladium-catalyzed Suzuki carbonylation, aminocarbonylation and alkoxycarbonylation of aryl iodides with CO in situ generated through the photoreduction of CO2. This protocol opens up an alternative avenue for CO2 utilization by harnessing solar energy.",

In the presence of commercially available CuI, 1,10-phen (1,10-phenanthroline) and  t -BuOK, the cascade reaction afforded the desired products in good to excellent yields with a broad substrate scope (14 examples). The predicted copper complex Cu 2 I 2 (phen) 2   in situ  formed from CuI and 1,10-phen could activate the triple bond through coordination. The isolation of \u03b1-alkylidene cyclic carbonate as the reaction intermediate suggests that the carboxylative cyclization of propargylic alcohol with CO 2 , followed by ring-opening reaction, is involved in the one-pot three-component cascade reaction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Selective hydrogenolysis is a crucial challenge for lignin valorization. A PdCl 2 -catalyzed hydrogenolysis of C OH bond of various lignin \u03b2-O-4 alcohol model compounds was developed for preparation of corresponding phenethoxybenzene in 78\u201398% isolated yield. Notably, the introduction of low-pressure CO 2  (1\u202fMPa) remarkably improves the reaction efficiency and selectivity of phenethoxybenzene. Neither over-reduction of aromatic ring nor further debenzylation was detected. This is understandable that the  in situ  methylcarbonic acid generated from CO 2  and methanol acts as an acidic catalyst and enhances the leaving ability of hydroxyl group of \u03b2-O-4 alcohols. Besides, the present PdCl 2 /CO 2 /MeOH catalyst system proved to be effective for reductive cleavage of C O bonds of \u03b2-O-4 ketones, producing ethylbenzenes accompanied with phenols in high yields. Furthermore, this protocol could also be extended to selective hydrodeoxygenation of the carbonyl group to methylene in aromatic ketones. As a sound reaction medium, such  in situ  CO 2 /MeOH acidic system could be inherently neutralized by depressurizing CO 2 , providing feature advantages for simple post-processing and none waste disposal.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress has long been known as a pathogenic factor of ulcerative colitis (UC) and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but the effects of secondary carbonyl lesions receive less emphasis. In inflammatory conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion free radical (O2 (\u2219-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (HO(\u2219)), are produced at high levels and accumulated to cause oxidative stress (OS). In oxidative status, accumulated ROS can cause protein dysfunction and DNA damage, leading to gene mutations and cell death. Accumulated ROS could also act as chemical messengers to activate signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK, to affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. More importantly, electrophilic carbonyl compounds produced by lipid peroxidation may function as secondary pathogenic factors, causing further protein and membrane lesions. This may in turn exaggerate oxidative stress, forming a vicious cycle. Electrophilic carbonyls could also cause DNA mutations and breaks, driving malignant progression of UC. The secondary lesions caused by carbonyl compounds may be exceptionally important in the case of host carbonyl defensive system deficit, such as aldo-keto reductase 1B10 deficiency. This review article updates the current understanding of oxidative stress and carbonyl lesions in the development and progression of UC and CAC.",

        "abstract": "Hundreds of NF-\u03baB inhibitors have been developed for cancer therapy, but their clinical efficacy is unsatisfactory. Here we show that the phosphorylation activation at Ser536 of RelA/p65 protein, a main subunit in the NF-\u03baB family, may play a tumor-suppressive role. In normal colon mucosa, RelA/p65 phosphorylation at Ser536 was increasingly increased with the maturation and apoptotic shedding of epithelial cells, but the phosphorylation at Ser536 was decreased in colon cancer. In colon (HCT116 p53 wt and p53 -/-), breast (MCF7), and prostate (LNCaP and DU145) cancer cells, a phosphomimetic mutation of RelA/p65 at Ser536 (named p65/S536D) triggered dramatic apoptosis through affecting expression of a wide range of cell death/survival genes, such as Bim, Puma, Noxa, Bcl-2 and survivin. In HCT116 cells, p65/S536D mutant upregulated Fas, insulted mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered cleavage and activation of caspase-3, 7, 8 and 9. A FasL neutralizing antibody (NOK1) prevented cell death induced by the p65/S536D. A pan inhibitor of caspases, Z-VAD-FMK (20 \u03bcM), blocked caspase-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization. This p65/S536D also triggered senescence in HCT116 cells through a p16-dependent pathway, but not in MFC7 due to lack of p16. Intratumoral delivery of the p65/S536D effectively suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Together our data suggest that the phosphorylation of RelA/p65 at Ser536 may confer it a tumor-suppressive role by inducing apoptosis and senescence, highlighting the importance of discriminating the function and active status of individual active sites in RelA/p65 when NF-\u03baB inhibitors are considered for targeted therapy of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) is not expressed in normal breast, but upregulated in primary and metastatic breast cancers, being a negative prognostic factor. This study characterized the molecular mechanisms of AKR1B10-promoted breast cancer metastasis. Ectopic expression of AKR1B10 in breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 or siRNA-mediated silencing in BT-20 cells affected cell adhesion, migration and invasion in cell culture, and metastasis to the lung in the nude mice through upregulation of integrin \u03b15 and \u03b4-catenin. Silencing of integrin \u03b15 or \u03b4-catenin eradicated the cell adhesion and migration enhanced by AKR1B10, both of which acted synergistically. In these cells, the integrin \u03b15 mediated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway was activated by AKR1B10, which, along with \u03b4-catenin, stimulated Rac1-mediated cell migration and movement. In human primary and lymph node metastatic breast cancer, AKR1B10, integrin \u03b15 and \u03b4-catenin were correlatively upregulated with r=0.645 (p<0.0001) and r=0.796 (p<0.0001), respectively.

A novel lncRNA transcript, 2.53\u00a0kb in length, was identified by transcriptome sequencing analysis, and was named p53-inducible cancer-associated RNA transcript\u00a01 (PICART1). PICART1 was found to be upregulated by p53 through a p53-binding site at -1808 to -1783\u00a0bp. In breast and colorectal cancer cells and tissues, PICART1 expression was found to be decreased. Ectopic expression of PICART1 suppressed the growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells whereas silencing of PICART1 stimulated cell growth and migration. In these cells, the expression of PICART1 suppressed levels of p-AKT (Thr308 and Ser473) and p-GSK3\u03b2 (Ser9), and accordingly, \u03b2-catenin, cyclin\u00a0D1 and c-Myc expression were decreased, while p21Waf/cip1 expression was increased.

        "abstract": "Electrophilic carbonyl compounds are highly cytotoxic and genotoxic. Aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) is an enzyme catalyzing reduction of carbonyl compounds to less toxic alcoholic forms. This study presents novel evidence that AKR1B10 protects colon cells from DNA damage induced by electrophilic carbonyl compounds. AKR1B10 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells of the human colon, but this study found that AKR1B10 expression was lost or markedly diminished in colorectal cancer, precancerous tissues, and a notable portion of normal adjacent tissues (NAT). SiRNA-mediated silencing of AKR1B10 in colon cancer cells HCT-8 enhanced cytotoxicity of acrolein and HNE, whereas ectopic expression of AKR1B10 in colon cancer cells RKO prevented the host cells against carbonyl cytotoxicity. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated AKR1B10 silencing led to DNA breaks and activation of \u03b3-H2AX protein, a marker of DNA double strand breaks, particularly in the exposure of HNE (10\u2009\u03bcM). In the AKR1B10 silenced HCT-8 cells, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) mutant frequency increased by 26.8 times at basal level and by 33.5 times in the presence of 10\u2009\u03bcM HNE when compared to vector control cells. In these cells, the cyclic acrolein-deoxyguanosine adducts levels were increased by over 10 times. These findings were confirmed by pharmacological inhibition of AKR1B10 activity by Epalrestat. Taken together, these data suggest that AKR1B10 is a critical protein that protects host cells from DNA damage induced by electrophilic carbonyl compounds. AKR1B10 deficiency in the colon may be an important pathogenic factor in disease progression and carcinogenesis. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death in China. Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) is involved in cytokinesis and plays key roles in microtubule organization in eukaryotes. This study was aimed to analyse the expression and to investigate the functional role of PRC1 in gastric tumorigenesis. The expression of PRC1 was evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The biological function of PRC1 was determined by CCK-8 proliferation assays, monolayer colony formation, xenografted nude mice and cell invasion assays by shRNA-mediated knockdown in AGS and HGC27 cells. The regulation of PRC1 expression by piperlongumine was also investigated using dual-luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-qPCR analysis. PRC1 was up-regulated in primary gastric cancers. Overexpression of PRC1 in gastric cancers was associated with poor disease-specific survival and overall survival. PRC1 knockdown in AGS and HGC27 cell lines suppressed proliferation, reduced monolayer colony formation, inhibited cell invasion and migration ability and induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Inhibition of PRC1 also suppressed tumour growth in vivo. We finally confirmed that PRC1 is a novel downstream target of piperlongumine in gastric cancer. Our findings supported the oncogenic role of PRC1 in gastric carcinogenesis. PRC1 might serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for gastric carcinoma.",

In this study, we demonstrated that pantoprazole (PPI) increased autophagosomes formation and affected autophagic flux depending on the pH conditions. PPI specifically elevated SQSTM1 protein levels by increasing SQSTM1 transcription via NFE2L2 activation independent of the specific effect of PPI on autophagic flux. Via decreasing proteasome subunits expression, PPI significantly impaired the function of the proteasome, accompanied by the accumulation of undegraded poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Notably, PPI-induced autophagy functioned as a downstream response of proteasome inhibition by PPI, while suppressing protein synthesis abrogated autophagy. Blocking autophagic flux in neutral pH condition or further impairing proteasome function with proteasome inhibitors, significantly aggravated PPI cytotoxicity by worsening protein degradation ability. Interestingly, under conditions of mitochondrial stress, PPI showed significant synergism when combined with Bcl-2 inhibitors. Taken together, these findings provide a new understanding of the impact of PPIs on cancer cells' biological processes and highlight the potential to develop more efficient and effective combination therapies.",

        "abstract": "Recently, several studies have shown that piperlongumine (PL) can selectively kill cancer cells by targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the potential therapeutic effects and detailed mechanism of PL in gastric cancer are still not clear. In the current report, we found that PL significantly suppressed gastric cancer both in vitro and in vivo. PL obviously increased ROS generation in gastric cancer cells. Anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) can abrogate PL-induced gastric cancer cell death and proliferation inhibition. GADD45\u03b1 was induced in PL-treated cancer cells and led to G2/M phase arrest, whereas genetic depletion of GADD45\u03b1 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could partly reverse PL-induced cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells. Interestingly, we also found that PL treatment decreased the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which plays an essential role in cancer initiation and progression. Our findings thus revealed a potential anti-tumor effect of PL on gastric cancer cells and may have therapeutic implications. ",

        "abstract": "In the liver, the signal and function of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) have mainly been assessed in association with liver regeneration. However, the effects of TWEAK on liver fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. To investigate the effects of TWEAK on human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and to explore the relevant potential mechanisms, human HSCs line-LX-2 were cultured with TWEAK. Cell migration was detected by transwell assay; cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8; the expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP8, MMP9, MMP10, MMP11, MMP12, MMP13 gene was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting; the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was tested by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay; small interfering RNA transfection was applied for depletion of MMP9 and p65. The result of transwell assay revealed that TWEAK promoted LX-2 migration. Subsequently, our data testified that the expression and activity of MMP9 was induced by TWEAK in LX-2 cells, which enhanced the migration. Furthermore, our findings showed that TWEAK upregulated the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 protein to increase MMP9 expression in LX-2 cells. Meanwhile, the alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and desmin expression were upregulated following TWEAK treatment. The results in the present study revealed that TWEAK promotes HSCs migration via canonical NF-\u03baB/MMP9 pathway, which possibly provides a molecular basis targeting TWEAK for the therapy of liver fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "In many gastric cancer patients, the disease is diagnosed in an advanced stage and therefore the mortality levels are high. Because there is a need to identify novel early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, we tested whether SIRT1 and STAT3 are good candidates. Towards this, we used patient tissues representing different stages of gastric cancer including gastric pre-cancerous lesions, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer, and probed SIRT1, STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) levels using immunohistochemistry. Our results revealed upregulated expression of SIRT1 in all stages of gastric cancer compared with noncancerous gastric mucosa, suggesting that high SIRT1 levels are likely involved in establishing gastric neoplasticity. However, STAT3 and pSTAT3 levels remained low until the gastric mucosa reached the tumor stage. Moreover, co-ordinated high expression of SIRT1 and STAT3 predicted poor overall survival for advanced gastric cancer patients. In addition, through analysis of gastric cancer patients from the TCGA dataset, we identified SIRT2 as an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients. We postulate that SIRT1 and STAT3 are potential early diagnostic and prognostic markers of gastric cancer. Our study also shows that SIRT1 acts a gatekeeper during gastric tumorigenesis.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer prognoses are persistently poor due to cancer's penchant to metastasize. As a crucial regulator of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) signaling, sirtuin 1's (SIRT1) function in gastric cancer has not been well understood. Here, we report upregulated expression of SIRT1 in tissues isolated from gastric cancer patients. However, we show that the depletion of SIRT1-mediated enhanced cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, and resulted in the enrichment of phosphorylated STAT3, acetylated STAT3, and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Additionally, we demonstrate that small interfering RNAs targeting the production of STAT3, AG490, and CL-821983 in cancer cells depleted of SIRT1 reduce metastasis. Our findings indicate that MMP-13 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients. In vivo models also showed that depleted SIRT1 promoted gastric cancer growth via the STAT3/MMP-13 axis. In conclusion, SIRT1 depletion encourages gastric cancer progression through the activation of STAT3/MMP-13 signaling, suggesting that SIRT1 may function as a tumor suppressor. We postulate that the upregulation of SIRT1 in gastric cancer patients may be the result of a feedback mechanism that aims to oppose the damaging effects of STAT3 signaling. As such, SIRT1 activators could potentially serve as preventive and therapeutic treatments for metastatic gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "The effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on cancer risk has received much attention recently. Over the last two decades, we and others have disclosed that PPIs exerted anticancer effects. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is essential for telomere maintenance. The activation of TERT is considered a crucial step in tumorigenesis; therefore, it is a potential therapeutic target against cancer. However, whether PPIs suppress gastric cancer by targeting TERT remains elusive. Our study demonstrated that PPZ treatment repressed TERT expression in gastric cancer cells via regulating TERT promoter activity by disturbing the interaction of STAT3 with the TERT gene. Additionally, PPZ led to chromatin remodeling within the TERT gene and resulted in a more compacted spatial conformation that is known to be associated with gene silencing. PPZ downregulated the TERT gene to inactivate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and reverse the EMT process, finally inhibiting gastric cancer metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that PPIs may be potentially developed as effective as well as relatively safe and specific anticancer agents.",

        "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal disease without effective targeted therapy. We screened a small-molecule library of 116 inhibitors targeting different targets of the cell cycle and discovered several kinases, including Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as vulnerabilities in CCA. Analysis of multiple CCA data sets demonstrated that CDK7 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Further studies demonstrated that CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in CCA cells. We also showed that THZ1 inhibited CCA cell growth in a xenograft model. RNA-sequencing followed by Gene ontology analysis showed a striking impact of THZ1 on DNA-templated transcriptional programs. THZ1 downregulated CDK7-mediated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicative of transcriptional inhibition. A number of oncogenic transcription factors and survival proteins, like MCL1, FOSL1, and RUNX1, were repressed by THZ1. MCL1, one of the antiapoptotic BCL2 family members, was significantly inhibited upon THZ1 treatment. Accordingly, combining THZ1 with a BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-263 synergized in impairing cell growth and driving apoptosis. Our results demonstrate CDK7 as a potential target in treating CCA. Combinations of CDK7 inhibition and BCL2/BCL-XL inhibition may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for CCA.",

        "abstract": "Neurotransmission is ensured by a high concentration of neurotransmitter receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. This is mediated by scaffold proteins that bridge the receptors with cytoskeleton. One such protein is rapsyn (receptor-associated protein at synapse), which is essential for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering and NMJ (neuromuscular junction) formation. We show that the RING domain of rapsyn contains E3 ligase activity. Mutation of the RING domain that abolishes the enzyme activity inhibits rapsyn- as well as agrin-induced AChR clustering in heterologous and muscle cells. Further biological and genetic studies support a working model where rapsyn, a classic scaffold protein, serves as an E3 ligase to induce AChR clustering and NMJ formation, possibly by regulation of AChR neddylation. This study identifies a previously unappreciated enzymatic function of rapsyn and a role of neddylation in synapse formation, and reveals a potential target of therapeutic intervention for relevant neurological disorders.",

        "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) have been associated with liver disease. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a critical role in the hepatic wound-healing response after liver injury, but there is little information available on the role of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in human HSCs. In this study, we explored the role of TWEAK/Fn14 in activated human HSCs. The LX-2 cells were treated with TWEAK, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Western blotting and RT-PCR were performed to evaluate the expression of Fn14 after TWEAK stimulation. Total and phosphorylated of inhibitor-\u03baB (I-\u03baB), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) were examined by western blotting after TWEAK stimulation and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. The result showed that TWEAK upregulated the expression of Fn14 and pro-inflammatory factors interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-6 (IL-6), regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In LX-2 cells, the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was closely related to the activation of the NF-\u03baB and STAT3 pathways. Furthermore, our research showed that STAT3 and NF-\u03baB could interact with each other, which resulted in a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. The activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT3 signalling-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine expression may be responsible for such a novel principle and new therapeutic targets in chronic liver disease.",

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and fibrosis play a crucial role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a major bioactive metabolite of natural antioxidant curcumin, is reported to exert even more effective antioxidative and superior antifibrotic properties as well as anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic abilities. This study was designed to investigate the potential protective effects of THC on experimental DCM and its underlying mechanisms, pointing to the role of high glucose-induced oxidative stress and interrelated fibrosis. In STZ-induced diabetic mice, oral administration of THC (120 mg/kg/d) for 12 weeks significantly improved the cardiac function and ameliorated myocardial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy, accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Mechanically, THC administration remarkably increased the expression of the SIRT1 signaling pathway both  and , further evidenced by decreased downstream molecule Ac-SOD2 and enhanced deacetylated production SOD2, which finally strengthened antioxidative stress capacity proven by repaired activities of SOD and GSH-Px and reduced MDA production. Additionally, THC treatment accomplished its antifibrotic effect by depressing the ROS-induced TGF1/Smad3 signaling pathway followed by reduced expression of cardiac fibrotic markers -SMA, collagen I, and collagen III. Collectively, these finds demonstrated the therapeutic potential of THC treatment to alleviate DCM mainly by attenuating hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and fibrosis via activating the SIRT1 pathway.",

        "abstract": "The T3SS chaperone CesT is recently shown to interact with the post-transcriptional regulator CsrA to modulate post-attachment signaling in enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. The molecular basis of the CesT/CsrA binding, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that CesT and CsrA both created two ligand binding sites in their homodimers, forming irregular multimeric complexes in solution. Through construction of a recombinant CsrA-dimer (Re-CsrA) that contains a single CesT binding site, the atomic binding features between CesT and CsrA are delineated via the structure of the CesT/Re-CsrA complex. In contrast to a previously reported N-terminally swapped dimer-form, CesT adopts a dimeric architecture with a swapped C-terminal helix for CsrA engagement. In CsrA, CesT binds to a surface patch that extensively overlaps with its mRNA binding site. The binding mode therefore justifies a mechanism of CsrA-modulation by CesT via competitive inhibition of the CsrA/mRNA interactions.",

In this study, we reported the biochemical and structural characterization of the PGN-binding periplasmic-domain of PA0833 (PA0833-PD). Via mutagenesis, key residues responsible for engaging PGN were identified, which also enables us to localize the PGN-binding pocket in a 2.0\u202f\u00c5 crystal structure solved in this study. In contrast to its homologous proteins (as represented by AbOmpA-PD of Acinetobacter baumannii) that interact with PGN by directly engaging the DAP (diaminopimelate) moiety, PA0833-PD exhibits an enlarged PGN-binding pocket due to residue insertions and the formation of an extra \u03b1-helix in one lateral side of the pocket. Accordingly, single DAP molecule does not show detectable interactions with PA0833-PD in solution, highlighting that other PGN-components, in addition to DAP, are also required to restore the full binding capacity observed between PA0833 and PGN.",

The viral spike protein plays pivotal roles in mediating receptor-recognition and membrane-fusion, and is therefore a key factor involved in viral pathogenesis and inter-species transmission. Here we reported the structural and functional characterization of the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) from DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (HKU23-NTD). Via mucin-binding assays, we showed that HKU23-NTD is able to bind sugars. We further solved the structure of HKU23-NTD, performed structure-guided mutagenesis and successfully located the potential sugar-binding pockets in the structure. Furthermore, via comparison of available betaCoV NTD structures, we demonstrated that betaCoV NTDs contain a conserved \u03b2-sandwich core, but exhibit variant folds in the peripheral elements located in the top-ceiling region and on the lateral side. While showing different compositions and structures, these peripheral elements are topologically equivalent \u03b2-sandwich-core insertions, highlighting a divergent evolution process for betaCoVs to form different lineages.",

        "abstract": "HES1 is a transcriptional repressor involved in cell differentiation and proliferation as well as in various cancer developments, but its expression pattern and biological roles in breast cancer have not been examined. In this study, we assessed HES1 expression in breast cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses and investigated HES1 function using MTT and Matrigel invasion assays. Significant relationships were observed between HES1 upregulation and advanced TNM stage (p=0.011), node metastasis (p=0.043), negative oestrogen receptor expression (p=0.001) and triple-negative status (p=0.001). HES1 overexpression was correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (p<0.05). The MTT and Matrigel invasion assays showed that silencing HES1 in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased cell proliferation and invasion, whereas overexpression of HES1 in MCF-7 cells enhanced its proliferation and invasion. Further analyses showed that silencing HES1 downregulated p-AKT and impeded epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas overexpression of HES1 upregulated AKT phosphorylation and induced EMT. Our study demonstrated that HES1 upregulation is a predictor of poor prognosis in human breast cancers and might be a critical contributor to the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Moreover, the proportion of cells with overexpression of HES1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples was significantly higher. Thus, HES1 might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of TNBC.",

BALB/c mice were injected with 4T1 breast cancer cell suspension. The test group was treated with VD reagent. The survival and tumor size of mice were observed. The proliferation of 4T1 in vitro was detected by MTS analysis. The changes of immune parameters and microenvironment in mice were evaluated by flow cytometry and real-time RT-PCR. Our results demonstrate that VD administration caused a decline in survival time and raising the volume of tumor, the decreasing numbers of CD3CD4 T, CD3CD8 T and CD4T-betIFN-\u03b3 Th1 cells and transcriptions of T-bet and IFN-\u03b3, an increasing number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and transcription of TGF-\u03b2.

The aim of this approach was to look at possibility and related mechanisms of anti-breast cancer (mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1) by CQ alone. The studies of anti 4T1 in vitro and in vivo by CQ were performed. The growth of 4T1 in vitro and in vivo, survival of mice post treatment with CQ, changes of immune parameters and microenvironment in mice were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that CQ could markedly inhibit growth of 4T1 in vitro through inducing apoptosis of cells, inhibiting secretion of TGF-\u03b2 and prolong the mice survival in vivo through boosting immune system by upregulating CD8+ T cell, and through down-regulating tumor associated macrophages (TAM), myeloid derived suppressing cells (MDSC) and Tregs, in microenvironment of mice bearing tumor. This provides a new mode of action for CQ and it is therefore concluded that CQ could be with potential in breast cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) is one of the most common types of salivary gland cancer that causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the substantial health burden of SACC, the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain poorly understood. We previously reported the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression to be common among SACC tumors, and the PTEN deficiency to be correlated with enrichment of epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes based on expression array analysis. The aim of the present study was to investigate further the functional function of WD repeat\u2011containing protein 66 (WDR66), one of the enriched EMT genes, in the context of PTEN deficiency and SACC pathogenesis. WDR66 was identified to be required to maintain the EMT phenotype and the expression of cancer stem cell genes in the context of PTEN deficiency. Furthermore, knockdown of WDR66 decreased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, WDR66 expression was identified to be inversely associated with PTEN expression and negatively correlated with the overall survival of patients with SACC. Collectively, the results of the present study revealed a novel function of WDR66 in mediating the progression of PTEN\u2011deficient SACCs, thereby suggesting WDR66 inhibition to be a potential therapeutic approach towards successful management of SACC disease progression, particularly against tumors with decreased PTEN expression levels.",

        "abstract": "Salivary gland tumor (SGT) is a rare tumor type, which exhibits broad-spectrum phenotypic, biological, and clinical heterogeneity. Currently, the molecular mechanisms that cause SGT pathogenesis remain poorly understood. A lack of animal models that faithfully recapitulate the naturally occurring process of human SGTs has hampered research progress on this field. In this report, we developed an inducible keratin 5-driven conditional knockout mouse model to delete gene(s) of interest in murine salivary gland upon local RU486 delivery. We have deleted two major tumor suppressors, Pten, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, and Smad4, the central signaling mediator of TGF\u03b2 pathway, in the murine salivary gland. Our results have shown that deletion of either Pten or Smad4 in murine salivary gland resulted in pleomorphic adenomas, the most common tumor in human SGT patients. Deletion of both Pten and Smad4 in murine salivary gland developed several malignancies, with salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) being the most frequently seen. Molecular characterization showed that SACC exhibited mTOR activation and TGF\u03b21 overexpression. Examination of human SGT clinical samples revealed that loss of Pten and Smad4 is common in human SACC samples, particularly in the most aggressive solid form, and is correlated with survival of SACC patients, highlighting the human relevance of the murine models. In summary, our results offer significant insight into synergistic role of Pten and Smad4 in SGT, providing a rationale for targeting mTOR and/or TGF\u03b2 signaling to control SGT formation and progression.",

Nanocomposites of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with the flame retardant were prepared. The prepared nanocomposites had good mechanical properties and the tensile strength of the nanocomposite containing 10 wt% nanorods reached 82.51 MPa. Besides, the storage modulus increased about 39.2% for the composites with 10 wt% loading of the flame retardant compared with neat PLA at 25 \u00b0C. Meanwhile, the LOI of the nanocomposite was about 25.0% and a V-0 rating in UL-94 was attained in the case of 30 wt% of the flame retardant compared to 20.0% and no rating for pure PLA. SEM observations of the fractured surfaces showed that the nanocomposites had good interfacial interaction, which resulted in the improvement of mechanical properties. The addition of the hybrid flame retardant led to the formation of a coherent and tight char layer as well as the production of PO2\u02d9 radicals and water, which retarded the combustion process of PLA.",

The Jeziorny and Mo methods were applied to describe the kinetics of the non-isothermal crystallization process. The results demonstrated that the presence of MOFs accelerated the crystallization rate and increased the crystallinity (Xc) of the PLA/MOF composites. The XRD results confirmed that the addition of MOFs decreased the crystallite size of PLA. The TGA results indicated that MOFs increased the initial thermal degradation temperature of PLA and decreased the thermal stability at high temperature regions. The tensile strength of PLA was increased from 66.23 MPa to 92.44 MPa, 96.03 MPa and 95.25 MPa with MOF loadings of 0.5 wt%, 1 wt% and 1.5 wt%, respectively, but the strain at break was decreased.",

        "abstract": "SummaryA polymeric flame retardant containing phosphorus and nitrogen (PCNFR) was synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatography. The thermal decomposition temperatures at 10% weight loss (T10 wt%) of PCNFR were around 358\u2009\u00b0C, and the char yield at 600\u2009\u00b0C reached about 60\u2009wt% both in nitrogen and air by thermogravimetric analysis. The flame retarded poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites with PCNFR were prepared. The thermogravimetric analysis results showed that PCNFR could improve the thermal stability of the flame retarded PLA composites with low loading (\u226410\u2009wt%) and at high temperature zone (\u2265390\u2009\u00b0C). The condensed products from the decomposition of the flame retarded composites at 380\u2009\u00b0C and 450\u2009\u00b0C for different intervals were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed that time and temperature influenced the structure of the char residue evidently. When incorporating 30\u2009wt% PCNFR into PLA, the limited oxygen index of the flame retarded composites reached 25.0%, and V-0 rating was achieved. The char residues were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in detail.

        "abstract": "In this study, the nanoparticles of metal\u2013organic framework ZIF-8 are incorporated into the poly(lactic acid) (PLA) to prepare the nanocomposite electrospun membrane. The diameter and the surface roughness of the fibers can be successfully controlled by increasing the content of ZIF-8 in the membranes. The prepared PLA/ZIF-8 membranes have increased oil wettability and significantly improved mechanical property compared with pure PLA membrane. The tensile strength, stain at break of PLA/ZIF-8 membrane with 0.5 wt% ZIF-8 are increased to 5.02 MPa and 88.81% compared to 2.77 MPa and 57.89% for pure PLA membranes, respectively. The PLA/ZIF-8 membranes are proved to be good candidate for oil/water separation with high efficiency because of the fast oil wetting ability, the roughness of fibers, and the adsorption effect of the porous ZIF-8 nanoparticles.",

        "abstract": "Nano metal\u2013organic frameworks (ZIF-8) particles were synthesized, and poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/ZIF-8 nanocomposite films were prepared by solution-blending and film-casting methods. The addition of nano ZIF-8 particles improved the mechanical properties and had an impact on the crystallization of PLA. The electrical properties of the PLA/ZIF-8 nanocomposites were found to be dependent on the frequency and the ZIF-8 content. The prepared PLA/ZIF-8 films had good transparency even as the content of the nano ZIF-8 particles reached 3 wt %. Compared with 21.5% of pure PLA, the limited oxygen index value of the nanocomposite film containing 1 wt % ZIF-8 reached 26.0%. Therefore, it is proposed that the prepared nanocomposites can be used as the substrates and dielectric to make disposable electronics. The char residues after burning were studied in detail by scanning electron microscopy and Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, and the flame retardant mechanism was also discussed.",

Here we present investigations of the efficiency roll-off in perovskite LEDs based on two-dimensional layered perovskites. By simultaneously measuring electroluminescence and photoluminescence on a working device, supported by transient photoluminescence decay measurements, we conclude that the efficiency roll-off in perovskite LEDs is mainly due to luminescence quenching which is likely caused by non-radiative Auger recombination. This detrimental effect can be suppressed by increasing the width of quantum wells, which can be easily realized in the layered perovskites by tuning the ratio of large and small organic cations in the precursor solution. This approach leads to the realization of a perovskite LED with a record external quantum efficiency of 12.7%, and the efficiency remains to be high, at approximately 10%, under a high current density of 500\u2009mA\u2009cm.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a facile and scalable process to achieve high performance red perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by introducing inorganic Cs into multiple quantum well (MQW) perovskites. The MQW structure facilitates the formation of cubic CsPbI perovskites at low temperature, enabling the Cs-based QWs to provide pure and stable red electroluminescence. The versatile synthesis of MQW perovskites provides freedom to control the crystallinity and morphology of the emission layer. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of chloride can further improve the crystallization and consequently the optical properties of the Cs-based MQW perovskites, inducing a low turn-on voltage of 2.0 V, a maximum external quantum efficiency of 3.7%, a luminance of \u2248440 cd m at 4.0 V. These results suggest that the Cs-based MQW LED is among the best performing red perovskite LEDs. Moreover, the LED device demonstrates a record lifetime of over 5 h under a constant current density of 10 mA cm . This work suggests that the MQW perovskites is a promising platform for achieving high performance visible-range electroluminescence emission through high-throughput processing methods, which is attractive for low-cost lighting and display applications.",

In planar LEDs, such as organic LEDs, around 70 to 80 per cent of the light generated from the emitters is trapped in the device, leaving considerable opportunity for improvements in efficiency. Many methods, including the use of diffraction gratings, low-index grids and buckling patterns, have been used to extract the light trapped in LEDs. However, these methods usually involve complicated fabrication processes and can distort the light-output spectrum and directionality. Here we demonstrate efficient and high-brightness electroluminescence from solution-processed perovskites that spontaneously form submicrometre-scale structures, which can efficiently extract light from the device and retain wavelength- and viewing-angle-independent electroluminescence. These perovskites are formed simply by introducing amino-acid additives into the perovskite precursor solutions. Moreover, the additives can effectively passivate perovskite surface defects and reduce nonradiative recombination. Perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency of 20.7 per cent (at a current density of 18\u00a0milliamperes per square centimetre) and an energy-conversion efficiency of 12 per cent (at a high current density of 100\u00a0milliamperes per square centimetre) can be achieved-values that approach those of the best-performing organic LEDs.",

        "abstract": "Quasi-2D layered organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as promising candidates for solar cells, because of their intrinsic stability compared to 3D analogs. However, relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) limits the application of 2D layered perovskites in photovoltaics, due to large energy band gap, high exciton binding energy, and poor interlayer charge transport. Here, efficient and water-stable quasi-2D perovskite solar cells with a peak PCE of 18.20% by using 3-bromobenzylammonium iodide are demonstrated. The unencapsulated devices sustain over 82% of their initial efficiency after 2400 h under relative humidity of \u224840%, and show almost unchanged photovoltaic parameters after immersion into water for 60 s. The robust performance of perovskite solar cells results from the quasi-2D perovskite films with hydrophobic nature and a high degree of electronic order and high crystallinity, which consists of both ordered large-bandgap perovskites with the vertical growth in the bottom region and oriented small-bandgap components in the top region. Moreover, due to the suppressed nonradiative recombination, the unencapsulated photovoltaic devices can work well as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of 3.85% and a long operational lifetime of \u224896 h at a high current density of 200 mA cm in air.",

Red PeLEDs can be achieved either by mixed-halide or low-dimensional perovskites. However, the device performance, especially the brightness, is still low owing to the phase separation or poor charge transport issues. Here, we demonstrate red PeLEDs based on three-dimensional (3D) mixed-halide perovskites where the defects are passivated by using 5-aminovaleric acid. The red PeLEDs with an emission peak at 690 nm exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 8.7% and a luminance of 1,408 cd m-2. A maximum luminance of 8,547 cd m-2 can be further achieved as tuning the emission peak to 662 nm, representing the highest brightness of red PeLEDs. Moreover, those LEDs exhibit a half-life of up to 8 h under a high constant current density of 100 mA cm-2, which is over 10 times improvement compared to literature results.",

Herein, we report a facile approach to achieve efficient and stable lead-free PeLEDs by using tin-based perovskite multiple quantum wells (MQWs) for the first time. Based on various spectroscopic investigations, we find that the MQW structure not only facilitates the formation of uniform and highly emissive perovskite films, but also suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ cations. The tin-based MQW PeLED exhibits a peak external quantum efficiency of 3% and a high radiance of 40 W sr-1 m-2 with a good reproducibility. Significantly, these devices show excellent operational stability with over 2 h lifetime under a constant current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is comparable to lead based PeLEDs. These results suggest that perovskite MQWs can provide a promising platform for achieving high performance lead-free PeLEDs.",

        "abstract": "Although the rapid development of organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells has led to certified power conversion efficiencies of above 20%, their poor stability remains a major challenge, preventing their practical commercialization. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic origin of the poor stability in perovskite solar cells by using a confocal fluorescence microscope. We find that the degradation of perovskite films starts from grain boundaries and gradually extend to the center of the grains. Firmly based on our findings, we further demonstrate that the device stability can be significantly enhanced by increasing the grain size of perovskite crystals. Our results have important implications to further enhance the stability of optoelectronic devices based on metal halide perovskites.",

In this work, we investigated the charge separation mechanism in multiple quantum well (MQW) perovskite films, which are composed of a mixture of layered perovskites (or quantum wells) with different bandgaps. Despite inefficient dissociation of photo-generated excitons in large-bandgap quantum wells due to the large exciton binding energy, efficient charge separation can occur at the MQW perovskite/electron-extracted-layer interface via energy and/or charge transfer from large-bandgap quantum wells to small-bandgap quantum wells. The MQW perovskite solar cell exhibits a 25-fold improvement in device efficiency, as compared to a pure 2D analogue.",

Despite recent advances in device efficiency, the stability of perovskite LEDs is still a major obstacle. Here, we demonstrate stable and bright perovskite LEDs with high energy conversion efficiencies by optimizing formamidinium lead iodide films. Our LEDs show an energy conversion efficiency of 10.7%, and an external quantum efficiency of 14.2% without outcoupling enhancement through controlling the concentration of the precursor solutions. The device shows low efficiency droop, i.e. 8.3% energy conversion efficiency and 14.0% external quantum efficiency at a current density of 300\u2009mA\u2009cm, making the device more efficient than state-of-the-art organic and quantum-dot LEDs at high current densities. Furthermore, the half-lifetime of device with benzylamine treatment is 23.7\u2009hr under a current density of 100\u2009mA\u2009cm, comparable to the lifetime of near-infrared organic LEDs.",

The relationship between morality and verticality found in linguistic metaphors can also be found in people's non-linguistic mental representations of morality. However, recent lines of work have demonstrated that personality differences may moderate the embodied effect of moral concepts on a vertical dimension. Based on these findings, we predicted that, by virtue of its facilitating role in encouraging moral thinking and behavior, religiosity may contribute to a stronger embodied effect of moral concepts. We found convergent support for this hypothesis across two studies using correlational (Study 1) and experimental data (Study 2). The findings suggest that there are individual differences in the metaphorical representation of moral concepts.",

        "abstract": "People implicitly associate the \"past\" and \"future\" with \"front\" and \"back\" in their minds according to their cultural attitudes toward time. As the temporal focus hypothesis (TFH) proposes, future-oriented people tend to think about time according to the future-in-front mapping, whereas past-oriented people tend to think about time according to the past-in-front mapping (de la Fuente, Santiago, Rom\u00e1n, Dumitrache, & Casasanto, 2014). Whereas previous studies have demonstrated that culture exerts an important influence on people's implicit spatializations of time, we focus specifically on religion, a prominent layer of culture, as potential additional influence on space-time mappings. In Experiment 1 and 2, we observed a difference between the two religious groups, with Buddhists being more past-focused and more frequently conceptualizing the past as ahead of them and the future as behind them, and Taoists more future-focused and exhibiting the opposite space-time mapping. In Experiment 3, we administered a religion prime, in which Buddhists were randomly assigned to visualize the picture of the Buddhas of the Past (Buddha Dipamkara) or the Future (Buddha Maitreya). Results showed that the pictorial icon of Dipamkara increased participants' tendency to conceptualize the past as in front of them. In contrast, the pictorial icon of Maitreya caused a dramatic increase in the rate of future-in-front responses. In Experiment 4, the causal effect of religion on implicit space-time mappings was replicated in atheists. Taken together, these findings provide converging evidence for the hypothesized causal role of religion for temporal focus in determining space-time mappings.",

According to Temporal Focus Hypothesis (TFH), people's implicit associations between space and time are conditioned by their temporal focus. Here we tested whether pregnancy can affect Chinese women's temporal focus and thereby influence their space-time mappings. One of the most striking characteristics of pregnant women noted by previous research is their future-oriented thought. Based on this, we predicted that pregnant women should be more future-focused. Consistent with this prediction, the results demonstrated that pregnant women tended to be more future-focused than non-pregnant women and demonstrated a greater tendency to conceptualize the future as in front of them, supporting the TFH. The current research offers a new perspective that culture-external factors such as pregnancy can also influence people's spatialization of time.",

Though this hypothesis has been rigorously tested across a variety of populations and tasks, the studies thus far have only been conducted in linguistic and cultural communities which favor the right over the left. Here, we tested the effect of handedness on implicit space-valence mappings in Tibetan practitioners of B\u00f6n who show a strong religious preference for the left, in comparison to an English group. Results showed that B\u00f6n right-handers tended to implicitly associate positive valence more strongly with their dominant side of space despite strong explicit associations between the left and goodness in their religion. This pattern of results found in B\u00f6n participants was indistinguishable from that found in English speakers. The findings of the present study support the BSH, demonstrating that space-valence mappings in people's minds are shaped by their bodily experience, which appears to be independent of space-valence mappings enshrined in cultural conventions.",

Based on the findings about the interplay between personality trait and temporal reasoning, we investigated whether individual differences in conscientiousness exert additional influences on implicit spatializations of time. Across three studies in laboratory and field settings, we measured studentsu0027 and non-student adultsu0027 conscientiousness based on their self-reports and naturally occurring punctual behavior. Results from these studies showed that participants who conceptualized the future as in front of them evidenced a higher level of conscientiousness trait than those who conceptualized the past as in front of them. These findings shed new light on the TFH by extending the range of individual differences that may influence peopleu0027s spatial conceptions of time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A large body of research documents cross-cultural differences in manual and non-manual pointing. These findings have often been explained as being due to pragmatic, linguistic, cultural, and bodily constraints. The current study narrowed the plausible range of candidates for explaining the pointing preferences, focusing specifically on manual availability. We examined pointing preferences by administering a referential communication task in two types of communities which share a national identity, geographic environment, ethnicity, cultural background, and language and yet vary in their degree of hand availability: farming and herding communities in southwestern China. Our findings show that farmers, who emphasize the use of manual labour in intensive subsistence farming, were more likely to use non-manual pointing in the task than herders, who demonstrate a higher degree of manual availability in the rearing of animals. This research has implications for how the availability of the hands in economic activities may have lasting consequences on cultural pointing practices.",

        "abstract": "In a vertical GaN Schottky barrier diode, the free electron concentration n in the 6-\u03bcm-thick drift layer was found to greatly impact the diode reverse leakage current, which increased from 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u2009A to 3.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124\u2009A as n increased from 7.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091014\u2009cm\u22123 to 6.3\u2009\u00d7\u20091015\u2009cm\u22123 at a reverse bias of 100\u2009V. By capping the drift layer with an ultrathin 5-nm graded AlGaN layer, reverse leakage was reduced by more than three orders of magnitude with the same n in the drift layer. We attribute this to the increased Schottky barrier height with the AlGaN at the surface. Meanwhile, the polarization field within the graded AlGaN effectively shortened the depletion depth, which led to the formation of tunneling current at a relatively small forward bias. The turn-on voltage in the vertical Schottky diodes was reduced from 0.77\u2009V to 0.67\u2009V\u2014an advantage in reducing conduction loss in power switching applications.",

A reverse conduction model utilizing thermionic field emission (TFE) with a triangular energy barrier is presented and then improved upon with a scaling factor that modifies the barrier thickness.

        "abstract": "Literature has indicated that accurate dietary assessment is very important for assessing the effectiveness of weight loss interventions. However, most of the existing dietary assessment methods rely on memory. With the help of pervasive mobile devices and rich cloud services, it is now possible to develop new computer-aided food recognition system for accurate dietary assessment. However, enabling this future Internet of Things-based dietary assessment imposes several fundamental challenges on algorithm development and system design. In this paper, we set to address these issues from the following two aspects: (1) to develop novel deep learning-based visual food recognition algorithms to achieve the best-in-class recognition accuracy; (2) to design a food recognition system employing edge computing-based service computing paradigm to overcome some inherent problems of traditional mobile cloud computing paradigm, such as unacceptable system latency and low battery life of mobile devices. We have conducted extensive experiments with real-world data. Our results have shown that the proposed system achieved three objectives: (1) outperforming existing work in terms of food recognition accuracy; (2) reducing response time that is equivalent to the minimum of the existing approaches; and (3) lowering energy consumption which is close to the minimum of the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) have demonstrated huge successes in multimodal representation learning tasks. During inference, DBMs function as Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) because of the intractable distributions. To learn the parameters, optimizations can alternatively be operated on these surrogate RNNs with \"truncated message passing\". As a consequence, the gradient will propagate through a long chain without any local guidance which can potentially affects the optimization procedure. In this paper, we address this problem by adding skip connections during back-propagation while keeping the forward propagation (inference) untouched. With skip connections, we implicitly assign local \"targets\" for the states of intermediate inference loops to approach. Applied to different training criteria on different data sets, we demonstrate the proposed algorithms can consistently help to train better models while at a lower cost of training time. Experimental results show that our algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) Flickr data set.\n\n",

        "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has found great success in domains such as multimedia understanding. However, the complex nature of multimedia data makes it difficult to develop DL-based software. The state-of-the-art tools, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch7, and CNTK, while are successful in their applicable domains, are programming libraries with fixed user interface, internal representation, and execution environment. This makes it difficult to implement portable and customized DL applications.In this paper, we present DeepDSL, a domain specific language (DSL) embedded in Scala, that compiles deep networks written in  to Java source code. Deep DSL provides (1) intuitive constructs to support compact encoding of deep networks; (2) symbolic gradient derivation of the networks; (3) static analysis for memory consumption and error detection; and (4) DSL-level optimization to improve memory and runtime efficiency. DeepDSL programs are compiled into compact, efficient, customizable, and portable Java source code, which operates the CUDA and CUDNN interfaces running on NVIDIA GPU via a Java Native Interface (JNI) library. We evaluated  with a number of popular DL networks. Our experiments show that the compiled programs have very competitive runtime performance and memory efficiency compared to the existing libraries.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical research and clinical practice are entering a data-driven era. One of the major applications of biomedical big data research is to utilize inexpensive and unobtrusive mobile biomedical sensors and cloud computing for pervasive health monitoring. However, real-world user experiences with mobile cloud-based health monitoring were poor, due to the factors such as excessive networking latency and longer response time. On the other hand, fog computing, a newly proposed computing paradigm, utilizes a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to conduct a substantial amount of computing, storage, communication, and etc. This new computing paradigm, if successfully applied for pervasive health monitoring, has great potential to accelerate the discovery of early predictors and novel biomarkers to support smart care decision making in a connected health scenarios. In this paper, we employ a real-world pervasive health monitoring application (pervasive fall detection for stroke mitigation) to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of fog computing paradigm in health monitoring. Fall is a major source of morbidity and mortality among stroke patients. Hence, detecting falls automatically and in a timely manner becomes crucial for stroke mitigation in daily life. In this paper, we set to (1) investigate and develop new fall detection algorithms and (2) design and employ a real-time fall detection system employing fog computing paradigm (e.g., distributed analytics and edge intelligence), which split the detection task between the edge devices (e.g., smartphones attached to the user) and the server (e.g., servers in the cloud). Experimental results show that distributed analytics and edge intelligence, supported by fog computing paradigm, are very promising solutions for pervasive health monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Body sensors have gained increasing interest during the past several years. With more applications deployed, it is imperative to ensure the success of data analysis, which largely depends on data transmission reliability as well as the importance of samples received. Traditional approaches focus on improving data reliability through various schemes such as the prioritization of MAC access. However, in this paper we analyze the characteristics of time series body sensor data and propose to rank sample importance based on a multi-level approach. With this approach, samples are grouped into five levels, indicating their importance with regard to data analysis. Then, a progressive transmission strategy is designed to transmit samples in order of their importance so that the overall received data quality is maximized. Extensive experiment results indicate that as much as 40\u201360% bandwidth saving can be achieved while meeting the requirements of data analysis algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, in 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these, over 600 million were obese. Accurately documenting dietary caloric intake is crucial to manage weight loss, but also presents challenges because most of the current methods for dietary assessment must rely on memory to recall foods eaten. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop computer-aided technical solutions to enhance and improve the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake. Our proposed system in this paper aims to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment by analyzing the food images captured by mobile devices e.g., smartphone. The key technique innovation in this paper is the deep learning-based food image recognition algorithms. Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately estimates dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages over other methods. However, how to derive the food information e.g., food type and portion size from food image effectively and efficiently remains a challenging and open research problem. We propose a new Convolutional Neural Network CNN-based food image recognition algorithm to address this problem. We applied our proposed approach to two real-world food image data sets UEC-256 and Food-101 and achieved impressive results. To the best of our knowledge, these results outperformed all other reported work using these two data sets. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach is a promising solution for addressing the food image recognition problem. Our future work includes further improving the performance of the algorithms and integrating our system into a real-world mobile and cloud computing-based system to enhance the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake.",

        "abstract": "In Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), efforts to eliminate the Tuberculosis (TB) epidemic are challenged by the persistent social inequalities in health, the limited number of local healthcare professionals, and the weak healthcare infrastructure found in resource-poor settings. The modern development of computer techniques has accelerated the TB diagnosis process. In this paper, we propose a novel method using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to deal with unbalanced, less-category X-ray images. Our method improves the accuracy for classifying multiple TB manifestations by a large margin. We explore the effectiveness and efficiency of shuffle sampling with cross-validation in training the network and find its outstanding effect in medical images classification. We achieve an 85.68% classification accuracy in a large TB image dataset, surpassing any state-of-art classification accuracy in this area. Our methods and results show a promising path for more accurate and faster TB diagnosis in LMICs healthcare facilities.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there were 10.4 million new TB cases worldwide in 2015. The majority of the infected populations come from resource-poor and marginalized communities with poor healthcare infrastructure. It is critical to reduce TB diagnosis delay in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. To combine machine learning and mobile computing techniques may help to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The goal of our research is to reduce TB patient wait times for being diagnosed by developing new machine learning techniques and mobile health technologies. In this paper, major technique barriers and proposed system architecture are first introduced. Then two major progresses are reported: (1) To develop an X-ray image database and annotation software dedicated for automated TB screening. The annotation software can help to highlight the TB manifestations, which are very useful for machine learning algorithms; (2) To develop effective and efficient computational models to classify the image into different category of TB manifestations. The model we proposed is a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models. We have conducted substantial experiments and the results have demonstrated that our approach is promising. We envision our future work includes two research activities. First, we plan to improve the performance of the algorithms with deeper neural networks. Second, we plan to implement our algorithms on mobile device and deploy our system in the city of Carabayllo, a high-burden TB area in Lima, the capital of Peru.",

        "abstract": "Recently there have been many efforts to study the predictability of stock market trend using post sentiments on social media sites. These studies have mainly focused on US stock market. In this paper we investigate the relationship between stock price movement and social media sentiment in China, which has a large stock capitalization and a unique social media landscape. We collect data from several different types of social media sites (microblogs, chat rooms, web forums), and find that data from these sites exhibit distinct characteristics in activity level, post length, and correlation with stock market behavior. Users in stock market related chat rooms tend to post more but much shorter blogs. The activity level is much more highly correlated with market trading hours and stock trading volumes. We then investigated several machine learning models to classify post sentiment in chat rooms, and achieved a performance similar to the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis result for short posts. We find that there is strong correlation and Granger causality between chat room post sentiment and stock price movement, indicating that post sentiments can be used to improve the prediction of stock price return over using the historic stock trading information alone. We further propose a prediction model that uses chat room sentiment to forecast the market direction, and develop a trading strategy that utilizes the prediction as trading indicators. Backtest using our strategy achieves promising portfolio returns. A total return of 19.54% is obtained at the end of the seven-month period when taking into account of slippage and commissions, compared to a loss of -25.26% by a passive buy-and-hold baseline strategy.",

        "abstract": "Financial markets are difficult to predict due to its complex systems dynamics. Although there have been some recent studies that use machine learning techniques for financial markets prediction, they do not offer satisfactory performance on financial returns. We propose a novel one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to predict financial market movement. The customized one-dimensional convolutional layers scan financial trading data through time, while different types of data, such as prices and volume, share parameters (kernels) with each other. Our model automatically extracts features instead of using traditional technical indicators and thus can avoid biases caused by selection of technical indicators and pre-defined coefficients in technical indicators. We evaluate the performance of our prediction model with strictly backtesting on historical trading data of six futures from January 2010 to October 2017. The experiment results show that our CNN model can effectively extract more generalized and informative features than traditional technical indicators, and achieves more robust and profitable financial performance than previous machine learning approaches.",

Existing approaches for automatic eating detection using wearable sensors often require custom hardware that may not be practical as their usability and energy efficiency have not been validated. In this paper, we propose to use off-the-shelf Bluetooth headsets to unobtrusively monitor and detect usersu0027 eating episodes by analyzing the chewing sound. The challenges of using commodity acoustic hardware include the limited sampling rate that reduces feature fidelity and the impact of environment noise in real-world settings. Our experimental results show that the traditional kernel-based approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) could achieve 94-95% classification accuracy in lab settings, though the detection performance quickly degraded to 65-76% for in-the-field testing. We then propose a novel Deep Learning based classification technique that drastically improved detection accuracy to 77-94% despite the existence of ambient noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Bluetooth headsets to detect eating episodes and to use Deep Learning to significantly increase classification performance in this context. We believe that the adoption of readily available and low-cost consumer devices provides a foundation for practical deployment of automated dietary monitoring applications.",

        "abstract": "Flow instabilities of non-Newtonian fluids severely hamper the quality of products during various chemical processes, such as fibre spinning, extrusion, and film blowing. The origin of extrusion instability has been studied over many decades. However, no consensus has been reached among the research community so far. In this paper, the possible cause of extrusion instabilities is explored using the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic conformation-dependent (FENE-CD) model with a nonmonotonic constitutive curve. Many well-documented experimental phenomena are reproduced in our simulations, and it could be concluded that the nonmonotonic constitutive curve plays an essential role in extrusion instabilities. In addition, the results imply that the die exit singularity may generate or magnify oscillations.",

        "abstract": "Person re-identification has become one of the most important problems in video surveillance system. In a multi-camera video surveillance system with non-overlapped area, the appearances of one person are much difference according different cameras or in the same camera at different times. On the other hand, different person may appears similar in one camera, so which made person re-identification a challenging problem. This paper carried out a person re-identification algorithm based on part feature specificity. This algorithm extract color, texture and shape features of different part of body first, then gather statistic specificity weight of these features for each part. At last, doing feature weighting both part weight and feature specificity in distance calculating, which make features with strong specificity more important. This algorithm indicates some parts of body are more important than others in re-identification, and the same part from different people with different appearance, the features with strong specificity are more important than the others. We have done our experiments at public datasets VIPeR and iLIDS, and evaluate the result by CMC. Result indicates this algorithm has higher re-identification rate, and more robust to viewing condition changes, illumination variations, background clutter and occlusion.",

This research provides answers for some fundamental questions in sheared binary mixtures of entangled polymers. Our results reveal that non-equilibrium steady states with finite domain size do exist, and apparent scaling exponents Lk; _ g \ufffd 1:05 and L?; _ g \ufffd 1 are found over six decades of shear rate. Since the wall effects get involved in our simulations, the dependence of average domain size on system size cannot be strictly eliminated. In addition, as an obvious influence of viscoelasticity, the polymer viscosity hp appears to induce linear translation of the fitted lines. Through two-dimensional numerical simulations, we show the detailed dynamic evolution of microstructure in binary polymer mixtures with asymmetric composition under shear flow. It is found that the phase patterns are significantly different from symmetric fluids studied previously. Finally, we also identify the importance of wall effects and confirm the irreplaceable role of inertia for a non-equilibrium steady state.",

The one-dimensional theoretical model is applied to predict the critical flow rate and surface contour of stable flow. However, the one-dimensional model overestimates the critical flow rate for not considering the extra pressure loss. Then, we develop a three-dimensional simulation method with OpenFOAM, a computational fluid dynamics tool, to simulate various phenomena in wedge channels with different lengths. The numerical results are verified with the capillary channel flow experimental data on the International Space Station. We find that the three-dimensional simulation perfectly predicts the critical flow rates and surface contours under various flow conditions. Meanwhile, the general behaviors in subcritical, critical, and supercritical flow are studied in three-dimensional simulation considering variations of flow rate and open channel length.

In this paper we propose a multi-scale two-fluid model that couples a coarse-grained microscopic method to the two-fluid framework for studying multi-phase fluids under shear flow. In this model the macroscopic viscoelastic stress is calculated by tracking the massive microscopic Brownian configuration fields in the simulation box. Both the macroscopic and microscopic equations are solved using a modified PISO iterative algorithm based on a finite volume discretization scheme. Our 2D numerical results reproduce numerous dynamic phenomena reported in literature and show that the theoretical model presented here could be a promising multi-scale approach to numerically study multi-phase viscoelastic fluids under flow.",

Here we report a hybrid integration of p-type carbon nanotube and n-type indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistors to achieve large-scale (>1,000 transistors for 501-stage ring oscillators) complementary macroelectronic circuits on both rigid and flexible substrates. This approach of hybrid integration allows us to combine the strength of p-type carbon nanotube and n-type indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistors, and offers high device yield and low device variation. Based on this approach, we report the successful demonstration of various logic gates (inverter, NAND and NOR gates), ring oscillators (from 51 stages to 501 stages) and dynamic logic circuits (dynamic inverter, NAND and NOR gates).",

        "abstract": "Active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) is the most widely used display technology nowadays. Transparent display is one of the emerging technologies to provide people with more features such as displaying images on transparent substrates and simultaneously enabling people to see the scenery behind the panel. Polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) is a possible active matrix transparent display technology due to its high transparency, good visibility, and low power consumption. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with excellent mobility, high transparency, and room-temperature processing compatibility are ideal materials for the driver circuit of the PDLC display. Here, we report the monolithic integration of CNT thin-film transistor driver circuit with PDLC pixels. We studied the transmission properties of the PDLC pixels and characterized the performance of CNT thin-film transistors. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated active matrix seven-segment PDLC displays using CNT driver transistors. Our achievements open up opportunities for future nanotube-based, flexible thin-film transparent display electronics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon germanium (\u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H) thin films were fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and developed as the infrared absorber for thin film silicon solar cells. Three kinds of the non-uniform distribution in \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H thin films including: \u201cthe non-uniform distribution of Si and Ge\u201d, the non-uniform distribution of crystallization\u201d, and \u201cthe non-uniform distribution of H\u201d, and how these affect the structural, optical and photoelectric properties of \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H thin films have been explored. The results show that the good film quality of \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H is associated with the low crystalline volume fraction and microstructure factor. The band gap of \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H is determined by the proportion of the Ge-related crystalline networks. In addition, it is suggested that the deterioration of the photosensitivity of \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H is mainly due to the increase of the Ge clusters with higher micro-void and defect density. Furthermore, by using \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H bottom sub-cells, the comparable efficiency can be realized under the thin thickness condition. An efficiency of 11.35% in an a-Si:H/a-Si 0.6 Ge 0.4 :H/\u00b5c-Si 0.5 Ge 0.5 :H triple junction structure with total cell thickness as thin as 1200\u00a0nm was obtained. It is believed that the \u00b5c-Si 1\u2212 x  Ge  x  :H thin films can be a better candidate for effective infrared absorber by further improving its microstructure uniformity.",

The proposed algorithm can achieve approximately minimal energy cost and ensure the stability of workload and battery virtual queues.

        "abstract": "Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has aroused significant attention for its performance to accelerate applicationu0027s operation and enrich useru0027s experience. With the increasing development of green computing, energy harvesting (EH) is considered as an available technology to capture energy from circumambient environment to supply extra energy for mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an online dynamic tasks assignment scheduling to investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay for an MEC system with EH capability. We formulate it into an average weighted sum of energy consumption and execution delay minimization problem of mobile device with the stability of buffer queues and battery level as constraints. Based on the Lyapunov optimization method, we obtain the optimal scheduling about the CPU-cycle frequencies of mobile device and transmit power for data transmission. Besides, the dynamic online tasks offloading strategy is developed to modify the data backlogs of queues. The performance analysis shows the stability of the battery energy level and the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay. Moreover, the MEC system with EH devices and task buffers implements the high energy efficient and low latency communications. The performance of the proposed online algorithm is validated with extensive trace-driven simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies an energy management problem for a typical grid-connected microgrid system that consists of renewable energy sources, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) co-generation, and energy storages to satisfy electricity and heat demand simultaneously. We formulate this problem into a stochastic non-convex optimization programming to achieve the minimum microgrid\u2019s operating cost, which is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and coupling feature of constraints. Existing approaches such as dynamic programming (DP) assume that all the system dynamics are known, which results in a high computational complexity and thus are not feasible in practice. The focus of this paper is on the design of a real-time energy management strategy for the optimal operation of microgrids with low computational complexity. Specifically, derived from a modified Lyapunov optimization technique, an online algorithm with random inputs (e.g., the charging/discharging of energy storage devices, power from the CHP system, the electricity from external power grid, and the renewables generation, etc.), which requires no statistic system information, is proposed. We provide an implementation of the proposed energy management algorithm and prove its optimality theoretically. Based on real-world data traces, extensive empirical evaluations are presented to verify the performance of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "2-Hydroxy-oleic acid (2OHOA) is a potent anticancer drug that induces cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We have previously proposed that 2OHOA-mediated inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), especially of SMS2, could be a potential therapeutic approach to manage metabolic diseases. However, other studies have suggested that 2OHOA's anticancer effect is mediated by SMS activation in cancer cells, including A549 and U118 cells. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, in this study, we treated both A549 and U118 cells with 2OHOA and measured SMS activity. To our surprise, we neither found 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation nor sphingomyelin accumulation in the cells. However, we noted that 2OHOA significantly reduces phosphatidylcholine in these cells. We also did not observe 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation in mouse tissue homogenates. Importantly, 2OHOA inhibited rather than activated recombinant SMS1 (rSMS1) and rSMS2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Intra-gastric treatment of C57BL/6J mice with 2OHOA for 10 days had no effects on liver and small intestine SMS activities and plasma sphingomyelin levels. The treatment inhibited lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity, consistent with the aforementioned reduction in plasma phosphatidylcholine. Since total cellular phosphatidylcholine is used as a predictive biomarker for monitoring tumor responses, the previously reported 2OHOA-mediated cancer suppression could be related to this phosphatidylcholine reduction, which may influence cell membrane structure and properties. We conclude that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator and that its anticancer property may be related to an effect on phosphatidylcholine metabolism.",

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that LPCAT3 is involved in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and carcinoma. Thus, LPCAT3 may have potential as a therapeutic target for these diseases. In this study, we devised an assay based on reversed-phase HPLC to measure LPCAT3 activity, which may facilitate the identification of LPCAT3 inhibitors and activators. We found that optimal pH and temperature of recombinant human LPCAT3 (rhLPCAT3) are 6.0 and 30\u00b0C, respectively. The enzyme Kms for substrates NBD-lyso-PC and arachidonoyl CoA, were 266.84\u00b13.65 \u03bcmol/L and 11.03\u00b10.51\u03bcmol/L, respectively, and the Vmax was 39.76\u00b11.86pmol\u00b7min \u00b7U .

A 2-DOF vehicle dynamics model, an upper level controller, and a torque distribution algorithm are designed for the straight running stability control system. A 2-DOF dynamics model is used to get the reference dynamics parameters according to the driveru0027s intention and the realistic vehicle status; the upper level controller is used to adjust yaw moment in order to ensure the yaw stability and get ideal yaw moment.; and the lower level controller is used to distribute yaw moment to four driving motors. Then the stability control strategy is validated by simulation. The vehicle dynamics model is built in Carsim, while the straight running control strategy proposed in this paper built in MATLAB/Simulink. In this paper, the wheel speed, the lateral offset distance and the yaw rate of the proposed control strategy are compared with those without control, in the maneuvers of \u03bc-split road and washboard road According to the result, it can be concluded that the straight running stability control strategy can improve the stability of the 4MIDEV, and decrease the reliance on driver in emergency situations.",

This paper proposes a mitigation conducted emission strategy based on transfer function from a direct current fed (DC-fed) WCS for EVs. A complete test for the DC-fed WCS is set up to measure the conducted emission of DC power cables in a frequency range of 150 kHz\u2013108 MHz. An equivalent circuit with high-frequency parasitic parameters for WCS for EV is built based on measurement results to obtain the characteristics of conducted emission from WCS. The transfer functions of differential mode (DM) interference and common mode (CM) interference were established. A judgment method of using transfer functions to determine the dominated interference mode responsible for EMI is proposed. From the comparison of simulation results between CM or DM and CM+DM interference, it can be seen that the CM interference is the dominated interference mode which causes the conducted EMI in WCS in EVs. A strategy of giving priority to the dominated interference mode is proposed for designing the CM interference filter. Finally, the conducted voltage experiment is performed to verify the mitigation conducted emission strategy. The conducted voltage of simulation and experiment is decreased respectively by 21.17 and 21.4 dB\u03bcV at resonance frequency 30 MHz. The conduced voltage at frequency range of 150 kHz\u2013108 MHz can be mitigated to below the limit level-3 of CISPR25 standard (GB/T 18655-2010) by adding the CM interference filters.",

The common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) propagation coupling paths are determined, and the corresponding transfer functions of the DM interference and CM interference are established. The simulation results of the conducted EMI can be obtained by software Matlab and Computer Simulation Technology (CST). By analyzing the transfer functions and the simulation results, the dominated interference is the CM interference, which is the main factor of the conducted EMI.

        "abstract": "A 3.7 kW resonant wireless charging system (WCS) is proposed to realize the energy transmission for electric vehicles. In addition to designing the electrical modules functionally, coupling coils are designed and verified by physical prototype, which guarantees the accuracy of coils and subsequent simulations. Then, we focus on the magnetic field distribution of coupling coils in the vehicle environment. Four points (A1, A2, A3, A4) in different regions and three points (the head B1, chest B2 and cushion B3) in the driving seat are helped to measure the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field distribution of coils under five offsets of 60 mm, 120 mm, 180 mm, 240 mm and 300 mm are analyzed theoretically and simulated correspondingly. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic field strength of test points are within the limits, but the strength at A3 is larger than 30.4 A/m required by SAE J2954 at 40% offset and 50% offset. Taking into account the composition of the actual magnetic field, the magnetic field distribution due to side-band and odd harmonic current are also obtained. An experimental bench for the proposed 3.7 kW WCS is built to validate the rightness and feasibility of the simulated scheme. The results of simulation and experiments of magnetic field distribution have less error and are often in good agreement.",

This extends a previous result by Carlen and Maas [Journal of Functional Analysis, 273(5), 1810-1869] for the quantum relative entropy (i.e., ${alpha} = 1$). Moreover, we show that the sandwiched Ru0027enyi divergence of any order ${alpha} in (0, infty)$ decays exponentially fast under the time-evolution of such a Lindblad equation.",

In this work, we study the approximation of the dynamics of the Anderson-Holstein model, as a model of the multi-level open quantum system, by Redfield and Lindblad equations. Both equations have a desirable property that if the density operators for different levels are diagonal initially, they remain to be diagonal for any time. Thanks to this nice property, the semiclassical limit of both Redfield and Lindblad equations could be derived explicitly; the resulting classical master equations share similar structures of transport and hopping terms. The Redfield and Lindblad equations are also compared from the angle of time dependent perturbation theory.",

Among the models, the modified Apelblat gave the best correlation results with the average relative deviation (ARD) of 2.02%. The effect of alkyl chain length on the solubility was discussed. The (liquid + liquid) phase equilibrium was observed in the system of benzothiazolium ionic liquids and water below the melting temperature of the ionic liquid.

In addition, the dynamics of the exoskeleton were analyzed and divided into three parts: the modeling of PMAs, antagonistic configuration of PMAs and the mechanical structure of exoskeletons. The dynamics of the exoskeleton was established according the three parts. Furthermore, a model-free control strategy was utilized to get the exoskeleton properly controlled, which is called Proxy-based Sliding Mode Control. The validity of the exoskeleton model was verified through the comparisons of the simulations and corresponding experiments.",

A traditional control algorithm, such as PID, cannot achieve satisfactory high-precision performance in trajectory tracking problem for PMAs, due to PMAs\u2019 features of nonlinear effects, slow response time, time-varying parameters. In this study we proposed a nonlinear predictive control strategy SNN-ESGP, which is comprised of a novel model called echo state Gaussian process (ESGP) that is suitable for modeling nonlinear unknown systems as well as measuring their uncertainties, and a single neural network (SNN) serves as the controller of the system. To analyze the system convergence, we utilize the gradient descent algorithm and deduce the iterative rules of the weights of SNN. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by using Lyapunov theorem. Finally, studies of physical experiments illustrate the validity of the control strategy with high-precision trajectory performance.",

        "abstract": "Pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs), a kind of soft/compliant actuators, have been attracted a great deal of attention in the studies of rehabilitation robots. However, the nonlinearities, uncertainties, hysteresis, and time-varying features of PMAs bring a lot of difficulties in their high-precision trajectory tracking tasks. In this paper, an echo state Gaussian process-based nonlinear model predictive control (ESGP-NMPC) is designed for the PMAs. The proposed strategy is comprised of an ESGP, which is suitable for modeling unknown nonlinear systems as well as measuring their uncertainties, and a gradient descent optimization algorithm for calculating the control signal sequences. Based on the Lyapunov theorem, characteristics of the closed-loop system are analyzed to guarantee the asymptotical stability. Both simulations and physical experiments are carried out to illustrate the validity of the proposed control strategy. Compared with other conventional methods, the ESGP-NMPC can achieve a better model fitting for the PMA and control performance for the high-precision tracking tasks. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Note to Practitioners</italic>\n\u2014High-precision control of pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) is a vital problem when PMAs are utilized as actuators of rehabilitation robots since the patient\u2019s safety and the performance of rehabilitation tasks are largely dependent on the accuracy of the actuators. Conventional model-based control approaches usually require relatively accurate identification of system parameters, which is difficult for the PMA, owing to its strong nonlinear and time-varying characteristics. This paper proposes a new model predictive control method based on an echo state Gaussian process that can describe the unknown dynamics of a PMA due to its universal approximation property. Through the optimization method, the controller can be efficiently realized and presents better performances than some comparatives. By applying this approach, it is possible to achieve not only high-precision control of PMAs but also a certain degree of robustness to the load.",

Due to the nonlinearities, uncertainties, hysteresis, and time-varying characteristics of the PMA, the model parameters are difficult to be identified accurately, which results in unmeasurable uncertainties and disturbances of the system. To solve this problem, a novel design of proxy-based sliding mode controller (PSMC) combined with a nonlinear disturbance observer (DO) is used for the tracking control of the PMA. Our approach combines both the merits of the PSMC and the DO so that it is effective in both reducing the ``chattering phenomenon and improving the system robustness. A constrained Firefly Algorithm is used to search for the optimal control parameters. Based on the Lyapunov theorem, the states of the PMA are shown to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Extensive experiments were conducted to verify the superior performance of our approach, in multiple tracking scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The exploration of cathode materials with high electrochemical performances is critical to improve the energy and power densities of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Iron fluoride (FeF 3 ) has been proposed as an ideal candidate of LIBs cathode material because of the high discharge plateau and theoretical capacity. In this study, a precursor-mediated method was proposed to synthesize FeF 3  nanocrystals (NCs) with different microstructures. These FeF 3  NCs were obtained through the thermal decomposition of the precipitated ammonium hexafluoroferrate [(NH 4 ) 3 FeF 6 ] precursor, and the morphology and crystallinity could be adjusted by varying the ethanol/water volume ratio in the procursor precipitation process. Electrochemical studies demonstrated that FeF 3  NC, derived from (NH 4 ) 3 FeF 6  precipitated from the solution with the ethanol/water volume ratio of 20, delivered the initial specific capacity of 217.6\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at 0.2C, associated with excellent rate capability up to 20C (93.8\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121 ), and showed the capacity retention of 80.6% after 500 cycles at 20C. These results indicate a tunable and convenient strategy towards nanostructured metals fluorides for high power LIBs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lithium-polysulfide (Li-polysulfide) battery has been considered as a developed energy storage device of the conventional lithium-sulfur battery with efficient active material utilization and good reaction kinetics. However, the weak interaction between soluble polysulfide and carbonaceous electrode is unable to restrict the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect, leading to the short cycling life. Herein, we innovatively design an asymmetric self-supporting hybrid sponge electrode whose one side is covered by deeply fluorinated carbon nanotubes (F-CNTs, F/C ratio of 0.88) with the appropriate thickness of \u223c0.5\u202f\u03bcm and the other side is kept bare as the current collector for the high-performance Li-polysulfide battery. The carbon nanotubes sponges (CSP) provides enough space for a high sulfur loading, three-dimensional net structure for fast ions diffusion and connective electrical conductive networks for electrons transfer. The F-CNTs layer shows a strong affinity to soluble polysulfide according to first-principles calculations, which restrains the diffusion of soluble polysulfide from CSP to anode and suppress the shuttle effect significantly. As a result, a high specific capacity of 1344\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  at 0.2\u202fC, an excellent rate capability of 780.9\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  at 2\u202fC and a great cycling stability for 400 cycles with \u223c0.11% capacity decay per cycle have been achieved at the sulfur loading of 2.55\u202fmg\u202fcm \u22122 . Particularly, at a high sulfur loading of 5.1\u202fmg\u202fcm \u22122 , the hybrid electrode even shows a reversible capacity of 868.9\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  after 100 cycles at 0.1\u202fC.",

        "abstract": "Lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries with high energy density are one of the most promising energy storage systems. However, the shuttle effect due to the transition between ring-like S8 molecules and high order polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 u003c n \u2264 8) hinders their practical application. Utilizing chain-like S2\u20134 molecules is considered to be an effective strategy to avoid this unfavorable process; however, the preparation of a carbon scaffold with ultra-micropores to constrain S2\u20134 molecules is challenging. In this study, a carbon scaffold derived from macadamia nut shell (MNS) with predominant ultra-micropores of sizes less than 0.6 nm is obtained by a simple KOH etching reaction followed by a calcination process. The calcined MNS (c-MNS) exhibits a high specific surface area (1687 m2 g\u22121), large pore volume (0.57 cm3 g\u22121), and large number of ultra-micropores (u003c0.6 nm) that account for 80% of the total specific surface area and 61.4% of the total pore volume. Then, a series of c-MNS/S composites are fabricated through a melt diffusion strategy. The electrochemical performances of c-MNS/S composites used as the cathodes of Li\u2013S batteries are evaluated. The composites deliver a maximum reversible capacity of 1254 mA h g\u22121 at 0.1C rate (1C = 1675 mA g\u22121), with a capacity retention of 80% after 100 cycles, and can operate steadily up to 2C rate with a reversible capacity of 540 mA h g\u22121.",

Generally, the middle layer of PSP includes helically wound high-strength steel wires as enhanced body and high-density PE as a matrix. In the engineering practice, this kind of composite pipe endures combined bending and internal pressure. Thus, it is of great importance to investigate the burst pressure of PSP under this load condition. In this paper, a full-scale laboratorial test of PSP under combined bending and internal pressure was carried out. A finite-element model (FEM) was established to study the mechanical behaviour and failure mode. In addition, we deduced a simple but effective formula for calculating the burst pressure of PSP under combined bending and internal pressure. The results obtained from the three methods show a good agreement.",

First, the real marine environment data and platform motion are collected in the field from the sea area. Then, tensile and bending tests of a flexible pipe are conducted to acquire its nonlinear tension-strain and moment-curvature mechanical properties. Later, based on the improved rod theory, the analyses of the flexible pipeu0027s motion response under the offshore pipelaying operation are carried out by fully taking account of the irregular platform motion and hydrodynamic loadings caused by wave and current.

This paper focuses on the characterisation of the squalls. The synthetic squall equations are introduced to simplify the actual squall time series. In addition, Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the response-based categorised estimates of maximum offsets and mooring line tensions. The hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated from ANSYS-AQWA and exported to ARIANE software in which the time-domain squall events can be considered as inputs. The systemu0027s responses, including turret offsets and mooring line tensions, are initially considered as the consequence of various critical parameters and instantaneous environmental parameters. Furthermore, a sensitivity check of critical parameters affecting the results has been carried out and discussed. Finally, the safety evaluation procedure required in the turret moo...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The investigation on the phenomena of objects falling into water is of great significance to protect the underwater equipment in offshore industry. The dropped objects into water are found to be affected by many factors such as drop angle, drop height, its physical properties, etc. This study mainly focuses on considering the influence of water environment (currents and waves) on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry by modifying the three-dimensional (3D) theory (Xiang et al., 2017) and integrating the effects of currents and waves into DROBS. Current is added as a uniform steady flow. The waves will bring a non-uniform unsteady flow field based on 3D airy wave theory. Thus, analytic expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments are modified by adding inertial terms from waves. The drag forces are revised by rewriting the relative cylinder to water particle velocities. By the comparison between the simulated trajectory of the cylinder under currents and corresponding recorded trajectory in the experiments, the simulations agree well with the experimental data. The effects of speed and heading of the currents associated with the cylinderu0027s initial speed are studied in DROBS and found to influence the trajectory and motions of the dropped cylindrical objects. Also, the dynamics of a dropped cylinder moving in the field of a progressive regular wave is investigated for different wave amplitudes, wave frequencies, and for different ratios of cylinder to water mass density.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology is gaining interest in the forensic community. The capabilities of high throughput and simultaneously analyses of many markers enable MPS as an attractive method for human forensics. Recent studies have demonstrated the successful application of the MPS system to short tandem repeat (STR) typing. However, not only DNA sequence variations in the repeat regions of STR but also in flanking regions are required to facilitate profiles sharing with capillary electrophoresis (CE)-based typing method. In this study, we constructed a multiplex PCR system for the MPS analysis of 10 autosomal STR loci (D13S317, D16S539, D19S433, D2S441, D3S1358, D5S818, D6S1043, D7S820, TH01, TPOX) by designing amplicons in the size range of 168\u2013273 base pairs. Sequencing results from 165 Chinese unrelated individuals demonstrated 11 variations in the flanking regions between amplification primer binding sites and core repeat motifs. In addition, three loci, D13S317, D5S818, and D7S820, displayed variants adjacent to the core repeats and caused discordances between sequence-based and length-based typing results. Four loci (D3S1358, D2S441, D19S433 and D7S820) demonstrated an increased allele number using MPS-based typing. This study demonstrated that STR typing by MPS could provide more genetic information from both repeat and flanking regions of STR loci, thus improving the diversity and discrimination power of the system in forensic detection.",

In this study, we performed PCR-based detection of microbial signatures of vaginal fluid, saliva, and feces in a Han Chinese population. We investigated the 16S rRNA genes of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Atopobium vaginae in vaginal fluid, the 16S rRNA and the glucosyltransferase enzyme genes of Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans in saliva, and the 16S rRNA genes of Enterococcus species, the RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit gene of Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and the \u03b1-1-6 mannanase gene of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in feces. As a result, the detection proportions of L.\u00a0crispatus, L.\u00a0gasseri, L.\u00a0jensenii, L.\u00a0iners, and A.\u00a0vaginae were 15/16, 5/16, 8/16, 14/16, and 3/16 in 16 vaginal fluid donors, respectively. L.\u00a0crispatus and L.\u00a0jensenii were specifically detected in vaginal fluid; L.\u00a0gasseri, L.\u00a0iners, and A.\u00a0vaginae were also detected in non-vaginal fluid. S.\u00a0salivarius and S.\u00a0mutans were not specifically detected in saliva. The detection proportions of Enterococcus species, B.\u00a0uniformis, B.\u00a0vulgatus, and B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron in 16 feces samples were 16/16, 12/16, 15/16, and 11/16, respectively. B.\u00a0uniformis and B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron were specifically detected in feces. In addition, DNA samples prepared for the identification of body fluid can also be used for individual identification by short tandem repeat typing. The mean detection sensitivities of L.\u00a0crispatus and L.\u00a0jensenii were 0.362 and 0.249 pg/uL, respectively. In conclusion, L.\u00a0crispatus, L.\u00a0jensenii, B.\u00a0uniformis, and B.\u00a0thetaiotaomicron can be used as effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid and feces. ",

In the current study, we developed a perl-based pipeline to separate the DNA mixture into its components and to predict the most probable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of each contributor to the mixed profile. We examined the usefulness of this method by detecting both artificially constructed DNA mixtures and mixtures from crime cases using the Precision ID Identity Panel on the Ion PGM platform. The separated genotypes of mixtures were validated by genotypes of each of the donors detected independently.

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial genome analysis is a potent tool in forensic practice and in the understanding of human phylogeny in the maternal lineage. With the development of molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques, high-throughput sequencing has enabled mtDNA analysis during whole genome sequencing, which provides more comprehensive information and raises the power of discrimination. In this study, peripheral blood samples were taken from 194 mother-offspring pairs and sequenced by Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and obtained high-coverage mitochondrial sequencing data, demonstrating the mutation levels at each position in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) between maternally related pairs. A total of 14,332 variants were observed at 891 nucleotide positions from 388 individuals, and the result shows that all maternally related pairs shared the same detailed homoplasmic SNPs and haplotypes. With appropriate criteria for avoiding false positives due to sequencing errors and contamination by nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, we identified 33 heteroplasmies at a frequency of \u226510% at 32 sites in 30 pairs. The maternally related pairs had the same heteroplasmic sites but with different allele frequencies. The dataset is available through EMPOP under accession number EMP00684 and will serve as an mtDNA reference database in forensic casework in Eastern China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Periodontitis is one of the most widespread infectious diseases in humans. We previously promoted significant periodontal tissue regeneration in swine models with the transplantation of autologous periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and PDLSC sheet. We also promoted periodontal tissue regeneration in a rat model with a local injection of allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the roles of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in periodontal tissue regeneration in swine. Method In the present study, we transferred an adenovirus that carried HGF gene into human DPSCs (HGF-hDPSCs) under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. These cells were then transplanted into a swine model for periodontal regeneration. Twenty miniature pigs were used to generate periodontitis with bone defect of 5 mm in width, 7 mm in length, and 3 mm in depth. After 12 weeks, clinical, radiological, quantitative and histological assessment of regenerated periodontal tissues was performed to compare periodontal regeneration in swine treated with cell implantation. Results Our study showed that injecting HGF-hDPSCs into this large animal model could significantly improve periodontal bone regeneration and soft tissue healing. A hDPSC or HGF-hDPSC sheet showed superior periodontal tissue regeneration compared to the injection of dissociated cells. However, the sheets required surgical placement; thus, they were suitable for surgically-managed periodontitis treatments. The adenovirus-mediated transfer of the HGF gene markedly decreased hDPSC apoptosis in a hypoxic environment or in serum-free medium, and it increased blood vessel regeneration. Conclusion This study indicated that HGF-hDPSCs produced under GMP conditions significantly improved periodontal bone regeneration in swine; thus, this method represents a potential clinical application for periodontal regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells have great therapeutic potential due to their capacity for self-renewal and their potential for differentiating into multiple cell lineages. It has been recently shown that the host immune system has fundamental effects on the fate of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells during bone repair, where the topical administration of aspirin is capable of improving calvarial bone repair in rodents by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production. This study investigates whether aspirin is capable of accelerating the regenerative potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) in a mini swine calvarial bone defect model.Calvarial bone defects (3 cm\u2009\u00d7\u20091.8 cm oval defect) in mini swine were treated with BMSC pretreated with 75 \u03bcg/ml aspirin for 24 h seeded onto hydroxyaptite/tricalcium phosphatel (HA/TCP), or with BMSC with HA/TCP, or with HA/TCP only, or remained untreated. Animals were scanned with micro-computed tomography (microCT) at 2 days and 6 months postsurgery and were sacrificed at 6 months postsurgery with decalcified tissues being processed for histomorphometric examination. The cytokine levels, including TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Aspirin at 75 \u03bcg/ml promoted the osteogenesis of BMSC in vitro and in vivo, shown by Alizarin Red staining and new bone volume in the nude mice transplantation model (p\u2009<\u20090.01), respectively. Defects treated with aspirin-BMSC showed significantly greater new bone fill compared with other three groups at 6 months postsurgery (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Aspirin-BMSC treatment has significantly decreased the concentration of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 (p\u2009<\u20090.05).The present study shows that BMSC pretreated with aspirin have a greater capacity to repair calvarial bone defects in a mini swine model. The results suggest that the administration of aspirin is capable of improving BMSC-mediated calvarial bone regeneration in a big animal model.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to investigate dynamic changes in brain Nogo-A protein in rats, and the effects of mild hypothermia therapy on its expression after Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Western-blotting and neurological scoring of 45 rats subjected to cardiac arrest and CPR were performed to investigate the expression of Nogo-A protein in the hippocampus and cortex 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Nogo-A expression levels gradually increased from 6 h after CPR in the brain. In the hippocampus and cortex, Nogo-A exhibited a unimodal waveform-first it increased, but then it decreased. It peaked at 24 h in the hippocampus, and at 48 h in the cortex. The expression of Nogo-A in the mild hypothermia group was significantly lower at 12 h (pu003c0.05). Mild hypothermia can reduce the expression of Nogo-A protein in the hippocampus and cortex after CPR, which may be one of the mechanisms that play a role in cerebral protection.",

        "abstract": "There exists no standard hospital emergency department (ED) triage procedure model for earthquake victims. This study provides an overview of the hospital triage procedure used for patients evaluated and treated at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu in the Sichuan province of China, following the May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.Emergency triage and treatment teams were comprised of senior emergency medicine (EM) attending physician, junior EM attending physician, EM residents, and specialty surgeons. Retrospective analysis of the hospital medical records of 2283 earthquake victims was performed. Victims' demographic data, triage process and group assignments, diagnoses and dispositions were reviewed.In the 2 weeks following the Wenchuan earthquake, 2283 total patients with earthquake-related injuries were admitted to our hospital. 54 victims (2.4%) were lost to follow up. Patients were triaged into four main groups: resuscitation (n=6), urgent treatment (n=369), delayed treatment (n=1502), and minor injuries (n=406). 68.9% (1572/2283) of the patients were admitted to the hospital during the 15 days after the earthquake. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1.0% (15/1572). 1304 victims were transferred to nearby hospitals after initial treatment, stabilization, or surgery.Proper triage strategy should be established prior to the onset of a mass casualty event and should be appropriate to both the severity of the disaster and the accepting facility resource availability. Triage methods utilizing multi-specialty treatment teams and dynamic hospital-wide coordination are critical for efficient, efficacious patient management. Hopefully, sharing with the emergency medicine community the arduous challenges we faced in the wake of the Wenchuan earthquake will be useful for planning the response to future disasters.",

        "abstract": "The adoptive transfer of autologous T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has emerged as a promising cancer therapy. Despite impressive clinical efficacy, the general application of current CAR\u2013T-cell therapy is limited by serious treatment-related toxicities. One approach to improve the safety of CAR-T cells involves making their activation and proliferation dependent upon adaptor molecules that mediate formation of the immunological synapse between the target cancer cell and T-cell. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of structurally defined semisynthetic adaptors we refer to as \u201cswitch\u201d molecules, in which anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibody fragments are site-specifically modified with FITC using genetically encoded noncanonical amino acids. This approach allows the precise control over the geometry and stoichiometry of complex formation between CD19- or CD22-expressing cancer cells and a \u201cuniversal\u201d anti-FITC\u2013directed CAR-T cell. Optimization of this CAR\u2013switch combination results in potent, dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity in xenograft models. The advantage of being able to titrate CAR\u2013T-cell in vivo activity was further evidenced by reduced in vivo toxicity and the elimination of persistent B-cell aplasia in immune-competent mice. The ability to control CAR-T cell and cancer cell interactions using intermediate switch molecules may expand the scope of engineered T-cell therapy to solid tumors, as well as indications beyond cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Mixed iodide-bromide organolead perovskites with a bandgap of 1.70\u20131.80 eV have great potential to boost the efficiency of current silicon solar cells by forming a perovskite-silicon tandem structure. Yet, the stability of the perovskites under various application conditions, and in particular combined light and heat stress, is not well studied. Here, FA0.15Cs0.85Pb(I0.73Br0.27)3, with an optical bandgap of \u22481.72 eV, is used as a model system to investigate the thermal-photostability of wide-bandgap mixed halide perovskites. It is found that the concerted effect of heat and light can induce both phase segregation and decomposition in a pristine perovskite film. On the other hand, through a postdeposition film treatment with benzylamine (BA) molecules, the highly defective regions (e.g., film surface and grain boundaries) of the film can be well passivated, thus preventing the progression of decomposition or phase segregation in the film. Besides the stability improvement, the BA-modified perovskite solar cells also exhibit excellent photovoltaic performance, with the champion device reaching a power conversion efficiency of 18.1%, a stabilized power output efficiency of 17.1% and an open-circuit voltage (V oc) of 1.24 V.",

However, safety concerns related to the inability to control CAR-T cells once infused into the patient remain a significant challenge. Here we report the engineering of recombinant antibody-based bifunctional switches that consist of a tumor antigen-specific Fab molecule engrafted with a peptide neo-epitope, which is bound exclusively by a peptide-specific switchable CAR-T cell (sCAR-T). The switch redirects the activity of the bio-orthogonal sCAR-T cells through the selective formation of immunological synapses, in which the sCAR-T cell, switch, and target cell interact in a structurally defined and temporally controlled manner. Optimized switches specific for CD19 controlled the activity, tissue-homing, cytokine release, and phenotype of sCAR-T cells in a dose-titratable manner in a Nalm-6 xenograft rodent model of B-cell leukemia. The sCAR\u2013T-cell dosing regimen could be tuned to provide efficacy comparable to the corresponding conventional CART-19, but with lower cytokine levels, thereby offering a method of mitigating cytokine release syndrome in clinical translation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this methodology is readily adaptable to targeting CD20 on cancer cells using the same sCAR-T cell, suggesting that this approach may be broadly applicable to heterogeneous and resistant tumor populations, as well as other liquid and solid tumor antigens.",

        "abstract": "Mobile web access log file plays an important role in the analysis about demand of mobile terminal market or user behavior. However, the log file data is highly dimensional, disorganized and semi-structured, which heightens the difficulty of data extracting accuracy; while it generates and transmits continuously, which poses an extracting efficiency challenge. It is highly desirable to extract the information embedded in log files as disorder or hidden situation efficiently and accurately. This paper proposes an efficient extracting method for mobile web access log with cache strategy. Firstly of all, data dictionary sets are built for each kind of complex field before extracting. Then, data is extracted based on the dictionaries, and the dictionaries will be completed simultaneously. Furthermore, with the discovery of the distribution of some data in the log generally following Zipf-like distribution, cache strategy is considered to be an auxiliary way to reduce mapping time. In addition, the classical cache strategy LFU is chosen. Ultimately, the experiment shows that the data could be extracted from the log accurately, and the extracting efficiency speeds up remarkably with LFU cache strategy.",

        "abstract": "Utilizing big data processing platform to analyze and extract insights from unstructured video streams becomes emerging trend in video surveillance area. As the first step, how to efficiently ingest video sources into big data platform is most demanding but challenging problem. However, existing data loading or ingesting tools either lack of video ingestion capability or cannot handle such huge volume of video data. In this paper, we present SVIS, a highly scalable and extendable video data ingestion system which can fast ingest different kinds of video source into centralized big data stores. SVIS embeds rich video content processing functionalities, e.g. video transcoding and object detection. As a result, the ingested data will have desired formats (i.e. structured data, well-encoded video sequence files) and hence can be analyzed directly. With a highly scalable architecture and an intelligent schedule engine, SVIS can be dynamically scaled out to handle large scale online camera streams and intensive ingestion jobs. SVIS is also highly extendable. It defines various interfaces to enable embedding user-defined modules to support new types of video source and data sink. Experimental results show that SVIS system has high efficiency and good scalability.",

        "abstract": "As we are moving to the cloud, one challenge is the pressure to provide an accurate picture of ongoing resource costs and associated application performance. While cloud offerings give great flexibility to elastic applications, tenants lack guidance for choosing between multiple offerings. The lack of knowledge could lead to tenants over-provisioning and paying for resource that they do not actually need, or under-provisioning with suffering performance issues. In this work, we propose an extensible framework for predictive analytics on cost and performance in the cloud. Resource consumption data is collected and placed at readiness for enabling immediate analysis such as billing with the models of pay-as-you-go and lease. The time series data stored in a tiering object store supporting fast retrieve, as well as the heterogeneous types of data on application events and performance, are utilized to facilitate pattern analysis. These data aggregation, meanwhile, is put into considerations concerning correlation between cost and performance and their changing trends over time. Thus, by leveraging what-if analysis and real-time prediction, the framework gives a quite precise view of current status on cost and performance, as well as future perspectives, so as to support decision making on resource configuration with satisfaction of application's Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements.",

Nitrogen adsorption and mercury porosimetry show that mixed nanopores and micropores coexist in MNC with a high specific surface area of 1978 m2\u00b7g-1 and a total pore volume of 0.99 cm3\u00b7g-1. In addition, the MNC is found to consist of EG and activated carbon with the latter deposited on the interior and the exterior surfaces of the EG pores. The thickness of the activated carbon layer is calculated to be about one hundred nanometers and is further confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission election microscope (TEM). A maximum static phenol adsorption of 241.2 mg\u00b7g-1 was obtained by using MNC, slightly higher than that of 220.4 mg\u00b7g-1 by using commercial activated carbon (CAC). The phenol adsorption kinetics were investigated and the data fitted well to a pseudo-second-order model. Also, an intra-particle diffusion mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, it is found that the dynamic adsorption capacity of MNC is nearly three times that of CAC. The results suggest that the MNC is a more efficient adsorbent than CAC for the removal of phenol from aqueous solution.",

This study investigates the spatial distribution and pattern characteristics of land cover in the landscape using geographical information system and remote-sensing techniques. With the synthetic consideration of both physical and cultural factors, the ecological stability of the landscape was discussed. The results showed that terrace and forest are dominant in the landscape accounting for 43.80% and 44.90% of the total area, respectively. A clear vertical land-cover distribution of higher forest-middle village-lower terrace-lowest river can be found on steep slopes. The local climate and its variation with elevation are essential for the stable local water cycle, and the spatial layout of the landscape elements allows for effective material and energy flow within the landscape. Moreover, the obligatory forest and water resource conservation due to the unique history and culture of Hani adds a social layer of protection. The sustainable development of the Hani landscape is expected to provide valuable insights for the present land and environmental management. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, two-dimensional materials have many applications in materials science. As a novel two-dimensional layered material, MXene possesses distinct structural, electronic and chemical properties that make it capable for potential applications in many fields, including battery electrode, energy storage material, sensor and catalyst. Up to now, more than 70 MAX phases have been reported. However, in contrast to the variety of MAX phases, the existing MXene family merely includes Ti\u2082C, Ti\u2083C\u2082, (Ti\u215f\u2082, Nb\u215f\u2082)\u2082C, (V\u215f\u2082, Cr\u215f\u2082)\u2083C\u2082, Nb\u2082C, Ti\u2083CN, Ta\u2084C\u2083, V\u2082C and Nb\u2084C\u2083. Among these materials, Ti3C2Tx MXene exhibits a prominently high volumetric capacitance, and its electron transport rate is suitable for electrode materials of batteries and supercapacitors. Hence Ti3C2Tx is commonly utilized as electrode materials in ion-batteries such as Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Al3+ batteries. What is more, Ti2C has the biggest specific surface area among all of these potential MXene phases, which reveals that Ti2C has remarkably high gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities. In addition, Ti2CO2 materials display extremely high activity for CO oxidation, making it possible to design catalysts for CO oxidation at low temperature. Furthermore, Ti3C2Tx with O, OH and/or F terminations can be used for water purification due to its excellent water permeance, favorable filtration ability and long-time operation ability. This review supplies a relatively comprehensive summary of various applications of MXenes in the past few years.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An electrochemical sensor based on hierarchically Cu-BTC MOF material for non-electroactive glyphosate detection has been firstly constructed in this report. By using Cu-BTC frameworks as a detection matrix, the large specific surface area of the material can increase the electrode reaction site and further improve the detection performance. The electrochemical behavior of Cu-BTC frameworks for glyphosate detection was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Under optimum conditions, differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPV) is employed to detect glyphosate. The results show that the fabricated sensor displays ultralow detection limit (1.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910 \u221213  mol L -1 ) and wide detection range (1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910 -12  to 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910 -9  mol L -1  and 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910 -9  to 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910 -5  mol L -1 ). Besides, this sensor possesses acceptable reproducibility and stability, as well as good selectivity against the major metabolite of glyphosate aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and other interference. Furthermore, this electrochemical sensor can also be applied to the detection of glyphosate in soybean. It is worth mentioning that this effectively Cu-BTC based sensor has great potential application in favorable and selective detection of organophosphorus pesticides in actual samples.",

        "abstract": "A photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor was constructed for the detection of non-electroactive malathion. It is based on the use of a hierarchical CuO material derived from a Cu-BTC metal-organic framework (where BTC stands for benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid). The modified CuO was obtained by calcination of Cu-BTC at a high temperature (300\u00a0\u00b0C) and possesses a high photocurrent conversion efficiency. Under irradiation with visible light and in the presence of malathion, the formation of the CuO-malathion complex on the CuO gave rise to an increase in steric hindrance. This results in a decrease in photocurrent. This novel PEC detection method has a lower detection limit of 8.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0mol\u00a0L and a wide linear range (1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910 ~ 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0mol\u00a0L).

The helix-helix transition along the PPA backbone during the \u03a6h (3D-SL) -\u03a6h transition makes the uniaxially oriented P1 capable of reversibly and reproducibly elongating (132\u2009%) upon heating and contracting upon cooling, exhibiting the behavior of a two-way shape actuator.

In this work, we report the first example of an olefin-linked 2D conjugated COF using a Knoevenagel polycondensation reaction of 1,4-phenylene diacetonitrile and three armed aromatic aldehyde. The resulting 2D poly(phenelyenevinylene) framework (2DPPV) possesses a sheet morphology, and a crystalline layered structure featuring a fully sp2-bonded carbon skeleton with pendant cyanide groups. Its unique alternating structure with a serrated configuration has been essentially evaluated using HR-TEM TEM analysis, nitrogen physisorption measurements, PXRD studies and theoretical simulations. Upon thermal and activation treatments, the as-prepared 2DPPV can be facilely converted into porous carbon nanosheets with large specific surface areas of up to 880 m2 g\u22121 which exhibit an excellent electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrodes and electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This represents an economic non-template approach to 2D porous carbon materials for energy-related applications.",

        "title": "Abstract LB-222: Long-term subclonal evolution of CLL from immune selective pressure after allogeneic stem cell transplant and donor lymphocyte infusion",
        "abstract": "Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PANext-generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed that the malignant subclones comprising a patientu0027s cancer can possess tremendous genetic heterogeneity at different sites of disease and over time. In leukemia, chemotherapy can hasten subclonal evolution allowing for rare leukemic subclones with aggressive driver mutations to gain a competitive advantage and to predominate at relapse, often portending an inferior treatment response. The impact of immunotherapy on subclonal evolution is less well studied. To determine the effects of allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on subclonal evolution, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on longitudinal peripheral blood and bone marrow from 4 patients with CLL. Specifically, timepoints analyzed included pre-transplant, post-transplant relapse, and post-DLI relapse over a period of up to 8.5 years. B-CLL cells (CD19+CD5+) and normal T cells (CD3+) were sort-purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting prior to genomic DNA extraction. Libraries for WES were constructed and sequenced to an average depth of 300x on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using 76 bp paired-end reads. Somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and indels were called using MuTect and Pindel, respectively, and copy number changes were assessed using an in-house algorithm. In general, these patients had more nonsynonymous mutations per pre-alloSCT sample than reported in other CLL NGS studies (average 30.3; range 8-45), likely related to the significant amount of pre-transplant therapies. Heterogeneous patterns of linear and branched subclonal evolution were seen after alloSCT and DLI in both responders and non-responders. Mutations in several candidate CLL driver genes were seen in this cohort, including SF3B1, SAMHD1, BCOR, EGR2, TP53, and DDX3X. Interestingly, sSNVs in multiple recurrently mutated CLL or cancer census genes (e.g. MAP2K1) rose to levels of detection only after alloSCT or DLI, suggesting they may play a role in immune evasion. In addition, several subclonal genetic variants, including missense mutations in FAM126B and LTBP3, were no longer detected after alloSCT or DLI and may thus represent potential neoantigens. In one treatment-refractory patient, a somatic nonsynonymous clonal CHEK2 mutation was found in 8 longitudinal samples and may represent a novel unique driver mutation. Finally, in one patient who experienced a durable complete remission after DLI, concurrent CLL WES and T-cell receptor beta chain CDR3 NGS was performed, which demonstrated a rapidly evolving T-cell repertoire at the time of complete remission after DLI. For CLL, alloSCT and DLI offer a potentially curative treatment strategy and a better understanding of the genes that confer susceptibility or resistance to these immunotherapies may help unlock the mechanisms that underlie these durable responses.Citation Format: Haven R.

ITH may have profound impacts on biopsy strategy, characterization of actionable targets, treatment planning, and drug resistance. The extent and architecture of ITH of lung cancers are largely unknown. Methods: We performed multi-region WES of 48 samples from 11 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas and their matched peripheral blood leukocytes to an average of 267-fold sequencing depth. All tumor samples were analyzed for point mutations, insertions/deletions, and copy number alterations. All somatic variations were validated with targeted capture ultra-deep sequencing to an average of 869-fold sequencing depth. Sub-clonal analysis based on a Bayesian statistics approach process was performed in each tumor sample. Phylogenetic trees of these 11 tumors were constructed after clonal ordering.

However, there are no reports about the effects of vanillin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mastitis. In this study, we explored the effects of vanillin on the subsequent inflammatory response and blood-milk barrier in LPS-induced mastitis. Results showed that vanillin suppressed the inflammatory response by a) inhibiting myeloperoxidase activity; b) decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators which include tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-\u03b1; from 128.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.59 to 67.51\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.88,pg/mL, P\u202f<\u202f0.01), interleukin-6 (Il-6; from 531.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f196.4 to 109.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f24.14, pg/mL, P\u202f<\u202f0.05), interleukin-1\u03b2 (Il-1\u03b2; from 2569\u202f\u00b1\u202f1648 to 731.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f171.7, pg/mL, P\u202f<\u202f0.05), inducible nitric oxide synthase (Inos), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2); and c) repairing the blood-milk barrier by increasing the protein levels of the tight junction proteins, including zona occludens 1 (Zo-1), claudin-3, and occludin. In vitro experiment, Vanillin can inhibit LPS-induced inflammation and enhance the protein levels of tight junction proteins. Further studies have shown that vanillin inhibits inflammation by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways. Our findings showed that vanillin protects mammary gland from LPS-induced mastitis by enhancing the blood-milk barrier and inhibiting the inflammatory response.",

        "abstract": "Mastitis, an inflammation of mammary gland, is a serious disease that affects the health of dairy cows around the world. Myricetin, a flavonoid from Bayberry, has been reported to suppress various inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of myricetin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced in vivo and in vitro mastitis model and clarify the underlying mechanism. In vivo experiments, myricetin attenuated the severity of inflammatory lesion and neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, myricetin pretreatment induced a significant decrease in the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 triggered by LPS. Myricetin pretreatment could also increase the integrity of the blood-milk barrier and upregulate the tight junction proteins in LPS-induced mice mastitis. In vitro, myricetin inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response in mice mammary epithelial cells (mMECs). In the further mechanism studies, we found that the anti-inflammatory effect of myricetin was mediated by inhibiting LPS-induced phosphorylation of AKT, IKK-\u03b1, I\u03baB-\u03b1, and P65 in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these data suggested that myricetin effectively ameliorated the inflammatory response by inhibiting the AKT/IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and repairing the integrity of blood-milk barrier in LPS-induced mice mastitis.",

        "abstract": "Sequential learning techniques, such as auto-context, that applies the output of an intermediate classifier as contextual features for its subsequent classifier has shown impressive performance for semantic segmentation. We show that these methods can be interpreted as an approximation technique derived from a Bayesian formulation. To improve the effectiveness of applying this approximation technique, we propose a new sequential learning approach for semantic segmentation that solves a segmentation problem by breaking it into a series of simplified segmentation problems. Sequentially solving each of the simplified problems along the path leads to a more effective way for solving the original segmentation problem. To achieve this goal, we also propose a learning-based method to generate simplified segmentation problems by explicitly controlling the complexities of the modeling classifiers. We report promising results on the 2013 SATA canine leg muscle segmentation dataset.",

It combines these partial evidence features in a random forests learning framework to predict patients likely to have the disease. Results of a retrospective clinical study from a 1000 patient dataset are presented that indicate that over 25 % new patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis can be automatically discovered by our method that were previously missed from the records.",

In order to reveal the physical mechanism of the microstrip filter, a lumped-element equivalent circuit is set up and the equivalence relations between its circuit elements and the electrical parameters of the microstrip filter are presented. According to filter specifications, the initial structural parameters of the microstrip filter can be easily calculated through these equivalence relations. As demonstration, an actual microstrip filter was designed, fabricated and measured, whose center frequency is at 2.50 GHz and fractional bandwidth is 36%. There are two transmission zeros near to the passband to improve the frequency selectivity, which makes the roll-off rate at each side of the passband as high as 125 and 50 dB/GHz, respectively. The out-of-band suppression from 3.6 to 6.1 GHz is greater than 40 dB. The size of the fabricated filter is    $0.21lambda text {g} times 0.18lambda text{g}$   , which is very compact.",

At present, the information resources for the use of Power grid equipment monitoring analysis is becoming abundant, but these information, which exists in every professional system independently, is lack of connection and meets the demand of big data analysis on power equipment monitoring hardly. In this paper, a unified information model, modeled by IEC61970 common information model and IEC61850 hierarchical model, is proposed for the analysis of big data monitoring in power grid equipment, which can establish the first and second Equipment Association within the scope of the grid equipment monitoring data, as well as realize centralized access to all measurement information in the method of extending measurement model.

In order to make its bandwidth adjustable, some varactors are utilized so that the resonant frequencies of the filter can be shifted. The filter has three transmission poles and two transmission zeros. By changing the values of these varactors, the bandwidth and the locations of the transmission zeros are adjusted. As the analysis shows, the filter has a relatively wide tuning bandwidth. For demonstration, a filter example was designed, fabricated and measured. The tuning bandwidth from 280 MHz to 940 MHz is achieved when the center frequency is fixed at 2.30 GHz. In other words, the tuning factional bandwidth varies between 12.1% and 40.87% meanwhile the insertion loss is between 0.9 dB and 2.8 dB. The size of the filter is $pmb{0.279lambdatext{g}times 0.132lambdatext{g}}$ where $pmb{lambda} mathbf{g}$ is the guided-wavelength at the center frequency.",

        "abstract": "Chemoresistance has become a major obstacle to the success of cancer therapy, but the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance are not yet fully understood. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification that is regulated by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and has an important role in a wide range of cellular functions. Here we assessed the role of O-GlcNAcylation in chemoresistance and investigated the underlying cellular mechanisms. The results showed that the HBP has an important role in cancer cell chemoresistance by regulating O-GlcNAcylation. An increase in the levels of O-GlcNAcylation indicates an increased resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Acute treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) or camptothecin (CPT) induced O-GlcNAcylation through HBP activation. In fact, the chemotherapy agents activated the AKT/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) axis and then induced the HBP. Furthermore, the observed elevation of cellular O-GlcNAcylation led to activation of survival signalling pathways and chemoresistance in cancer cells. Finally, suppression of O-GlcNAcylation reduced the resistance of both established and primary cancer cells to chemotherapy. These results provide significant novel insights regarding the important role of the HBP and O-GlcNAcylation in regulating cancer chemoresistance. Thus, O-GlcNAc inhibition might offer a new strategy for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy.",

According to clinical signs and plasma levels, 81 multiparous Holstein cows from a dairy farm were divided into clinical ketosis, subclinical ketosis and healthy control groups during 7\u201321 d after calving. Different metabolites were identified by NMR and combined with multivariate statistical analysis to determine the pathway. There were 29 metabolites obtained, including three carbohydrates, six lipids, 14 amino acids and six other metabolites. Consulting a database and the metabolite analysis showed that these metabolites were mainly related to amino acid, fat and carbohydrate metabolisms. The results indicated that metabolomics revealed changes in the occurrence and development of dairy cow ketosis, and also that the different metabolites could be potential markers and...",

Nanocomposites used grafted polymer as fillers with loadings from 0.5 to 1.0 wt % of poly(methyl methacrylate) were obtained by solution blending. The structures, properties and morphology of graphene oxide, grafted poly(methyl methacrylate) and composites are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and bacterial adhesion examination respectively. The initial decomposition temperature and the glass transition temperature of the nanocomposites are improved by addition of grafted poly(methyl methacrylate). Furthermore, there is a significant enhancement of the decreasing of the surface bacterial adhesion of prepared nanocomposites.",

In this study, we established a rat model of varying OSA with different grades of CIH (12.5% O, 10% O, 7.5% O, and 5% O) for 12 weeks, and found that CIH stimulated insulin secretion, reduced the insulin:proinsulin ratio in pancreatic tissue, and caused pancreatic tissue lesions and cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CIH promoted the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38, depending on the O concentration. In summary, CIH disturbed insulin secretion, and caused inflammation, lesions, and cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissue via the MAPK signaling pathway, which may be of great significance for clinical treatment of OSA and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",

        "abstract": "The effect of Shenfu on biochemical parameters and survival during resuscitation in patients with septic shock was examined. This was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, open-label trial carried out in 210 patients with septic shock from seven medical centers in China. They were randomized to Shenfu or saline. The primary outcome was lactate clearance. The secondary outcomes were shock index normalization, dose of vasopressors, ICU stay, hospital stay, and mortality. A total of 199 patients completed the trial. Blood pressure, heart rate, and other routine lab tests showed no difference between the groups. Lactate levels and lactate clearance were similar between the two groups. Hospital and ICU stay were similar between the two groups. When considering all patients, the 7- and 28-day mortality were similar between the two groups, but when considering only patients with lactate levels \u22654.5\u2009mmol/L, the Shenfu group showed a better 7-day survival than the control group (7 days: 83.3% versus 54.5%, P = 0.034; 28 days: 72.7% versus 47.6%, P = 0.092). Shenfu may improve the 7-day survival in patients with impaired lactate clearance (\u22654.5\u2009mmol/L), but the mechanism for this effect is unclear. Additional studies are necessary to characterize the hemodynamic changes after Shenfu infusion. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-TRC-11001369. ",

        "abstract": "Land degradation has become an important issue in western China recently. Oasis ecosystem is sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as abnormal /extreme events of precipitations, water supply from upper watersheds, fluctuations of temperatures, etc. Satellite remote sensing of terrestrial ecosystems provides temporal dynamics and spatial distributions of landscape green covers over large areas. Seasonal green cover data are normally important in assessing landscape health (ex. desertification, rate of urban sprawl, natural disturbances) in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, green cover data is derived from vegetation indices retrieved from MODIS sensors onboard Terra. The satellite images during the period April 2000 to December 2005 are analyzed to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal changes of Ejin Oasis. The results will help improving monitoring techniques to evaluate land degradation and to estimate the newest tendency of landscape green cover dynamics in the Ejin Oasis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, the first-order torsional mode shape functions in both directions vertical and parallel to the middle plane of cantilever plate were obtained according to ANSYS software and the optimization principle. The coupling equation of elastic modulus, shear modulus and first-order torsional frequency of cantilever plate was derived with the aid of energy method. The integral of the two mode shape coefficients in the equation, kinetic energy, torsional strain energy and tensile-compressive strain energy were computed. The calculated value was then conducted with binary linear regression to derive the relationship of mode shape coefficient with width-to-length and height-to-width ratios. The correctness of coupling equation was verified by dynamic and static tests of isotropic materials and lumbers of various tree species. The method of measuring shear modulus by frequency spectrum of cantilever plate was proposed and it has advantages of convenience, celerity and good repeatability. This method applies to testing shear modulus of isotropic materials and three main-direction shear modulus ( G LT  ,  G LR   and  G RT  ) of timbers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, the principle and method for synchronous dynamic measurement of elasticity, shear modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio of wood and wood composite with two strain gauges were studied and discussed. The experimental scheme, named 0\u00b0\u201375\u00b0 scheme, was developed for synchronous dynamic measurement of elasticity ( E ), shear modulus ( G ) and Poisson\u2019s ratio (    \u03bc    ) with two strain gauges of 0\u00b0 and 75\u00b0. The 75\u00b0 strain gauge was not only used to measure Poisson\u2019s ratio together with the 0\u00b0 strain gauge, but also to measure the first-order torsional frequency of cantilever plate. In addition, the principle of measuring elasticity and shear modulus by the 0\u00b0\u201375\u00b0 scheme was described. Based on the stress and strain analysis of first-order bending and torsional modes of cantilever plates, the pasting position and orientation of strain gauges in the 0\u00b0\u201375\u00b0 scheme were decided. Comparing the results of using two combinations of strain gauges, 0\u00b0\u201375\u00b0 and 0\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 schemes, the correspondence indicates that the 0\u00b0\u201375\u00b0 scheme is feasible for dynamic measurement of Poisson\u2019s ratio. By transient excitation, the strain spectrums under 0\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 of Poplar\u2019s tangential section, Sitka spruce\u2019s radial section and medium density fiberboard (MDF) cantilever plate were measured. Thus, one-hammer-excitation synchronous measurement of elasticity, shear modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio of materials was achieved. Its correctness was verified by axial tension and static square-plate torsion tests.",

        "abstract": "The constructing of novel supramolecular prodrug nanoparticles based on the host\u2013guest interaction of water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6) and novel doxorubicin (DOX)-based prodrugs (G1 or G2) is reported, in which these two kinds of prodrugs are synthesized by conjugating DOX with a flexible alkyl chain or a short EGn chain via an acid-cleavable hydrazone bond. The obtained supramolecular nanoparticles are stable under physiological conditions, whereas the cumulative release of DOX is approximate to 100% within 30 min at pH 5.5 by simulating the endolysosomal environment at 37 \u00b0C. It is noteworthy that WP6 can efficiently catalyze the cleavage of hydrazone bond of the prodrug G1 or G2 via a favored intramolecular process under acidic conditions. Moreover, intracellular localization experiments demonstrated that these two nanoparticles, taken up by cancer cells via endocytosis, can lead to efficient DOX accumulation in SKOV3 cancer cells. Cytotoxicity experiments further suggest that these nanoparticles can...",

The catalytic behavior of Cu nanocrystals depends mainly on the structure and particle size. In this work, formation of high-purity Cu nanocrystals is studied using a common chemical vapor deposition precursor of cupric tartrate. This process is investigated through a combined experimental and computational approach. The decomposition kinetics is researched via differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger, and Starink methods. The growth was found to be influenced by the factors of reaction temperature, protective gas, and time. And microstructural and thermal characterizations were performed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Decomposition of cupric tartrate at different temperatures was simulated by density functional theory calculations under the generalized gradient approximation. High crystalline Cu nanocrystals without floccules were obtained from thermal decomposition of cupric tartrate at 271\u00b0C for 8 h under Ar. This general approach paves a way to controllable synthesis of Cu nanocrystals with high purity.",

This method was developed to identify peptides with activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) inducing cytopathic effects on WISH cells.Sixteen positive clones were obtained after 3 rounds of functional selection. Ten clones were picked from these positive clones according to the results of phage ELISA and were sequenced. The amino acid sequences homologous to IFN alpha-2b were defined by residues AB loop 31-37, BC loop 68-74, C helix 93-99, CD loop 106-112, D helix 115-121, DE loop 132-138, and E helix 143-161. Two of the peptides, designated clones T3 and T9, aligned with the IFNAR2-binding domains (AB loop and E helix), were synthesized and designated as IR-7 and KP-7, respectively. Both KP-7 and IR-7 were found to compete with GFP/IFN alpha-2b for receptor binding and mimicked the antiviral activity of IFN alpha -2b cooperatively.Two IFN alpha-2b mimetic peptides with antiviral activity were derived from a phage-display heptapeptide library using a novel functional selection method.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the efficient facilitated diffusion via carrier proteins in biological membranes, facilitated transport membranes with synthetic carriers have been fabricated to enhance the separation performance via carrier-penetrant reversible reactions. Constructing highly ordered channels for the facilitated transport process in such membranes is favorable for achieving high efficiency, but reports are quite rare. Herein, crystalline porous covalent organic framework nanosheets (CONs) with regular pore structures, were used to load transition metal ions (typical carriers for unsaturated molecules) on their pore wall to enable a facilitated transport process in ordered channels. The physicochemical properties of the channels were elucidated by the CON microenvironments including the physical microenvironment (pore size) and the chemical microenvironment (carrier amount and carrier type). The microenvironment\u2013performance relationship of the membranes was explored. The optimized facilitated transport membranes exhibited promising separation performance for gasoline desulfurization with a permeation flux of 21.6 kg m\u22122 h\u22121 and an enrichment factor of 6.29. Long-term operational stability and enhanced anti-swelling properties manifested superior stability of the resulting membranes.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, to meet the greater demand for next generation electronic devices that are transplantable, lightweight and portable, flexible and large-scale integrated electronics attract much more attention have been of interest in both industry and academia. Organic electronics and stretchable inorganic electronics are the two major branches of flexible electronics. With the semiconductive and flexible properties of the organic semiconductor materials, flexible organic electronics have become a mainstay of our technology. Compared to organic electronics, stretchable and flexible inorganic electronics are fabricated via mechanical design with inorganic electronic components on flexible substrates, which have stretchability and flexibility to enable very large deformations without degradation of performance. This review summarizes the recent progress on fabrication strategies, such as hydrodynamic organic nanowire printing and inkjet-assisted nanotransfer printing of flexible organic electronics, and screen printing, soft lithography and transfer printing of flexible inorganic electronics. In addition, this review considers large-scale organic and inorganic flexible electronic systems and the future applications of flexible and stretchable electronics.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral neuromodulation has been widely used throughout clinical practices and basic neuroscience research. However, the mechanical and geometrical mismatches at current electrode-nerve interfaces and complicated surgical implantation often induce irreversible neural damage, such as axonal degradation. Here, compatible with traditional 2D planar processing, we propose a 3D twining electrode by integrating stretchable mesh serpentine wires onto a flexible shape memory substrate, which has permanent shape reconfigurability (from 2D to 3D), distinct elastic modulus controllability (from ~100 MPa to ~300 kPa), and shape memory recoverability at body temperature. Similar to the climbing process of twining plants, the temporarily flattened 2D stiff twining electrode can naturally self-climb onto nerves driven by 37\u00b0C normal saline and form 3D flexible neural interfaces with minimal constraint on the deforming nerves. In vivo animal experiments, including right vagus nerve stimulation for reducing the heart rate and action potential recording of the sciatic nerve, demonstrate the potential clinical utility.",

        "abstract": "A new strategy for the preparation of nanogels from commercially available monomers of bisepoxide and aliphatic polyetheramine has been developed. The nanogels are generated in a one-pot process through aggregation polymerization of an in situ formed thermal sensitive intermediate polymer in an additive-free and catalyst-free aqueous environment. Such a facile process allows easy size tuning of the gel particles from the nanometer to the micron scale, simply by adjusting the reactant concentration. The obtained nanogels demonstrated responsiveness to multiple biologically relevant stimuli, including temperature, pH, and oxidation. Nile red was encapsulated in the nanogels as a model hydrophobic drug. In vitro drug release studies showed stimuli-triggered release from the nanogels, suggesting the potential for controlled drug delivery.",

        "abstract": "The art of cooking is always fascinating. Nevertheless, reproducing a delicious dish that one has never encountered before is not easy. Even if the name of dish is known and the corresponding recipe could be retrieved, the right ingredients for cooking the dish may not be available due to factors such as geography region or season. Furthermore, knowing how to cut, cook and control timing may be challenging for one whose has no cooking experience. In this paper, an all-around cooking assistant mobile app, named Pic2Dish, is developed to help users who would like to cook a dish but neither know the name of dish nor has cooking skill. Basically, by inputting a picture of the dish and the list of ingredients at hand, Pic2Dish automatically recognizes the dish name and recommends a customized recipe together with video clips to guide user on how to cook the dish. Importantly, the recommended recipe is modified from a retrieved recipe that best matches the given dish, with missing ingredients being replaced with the available ingredients that match dish context and taste. The whole process involves the recognition of dishes with convolutional neural network, classification of key and non-key ingredients, and context analysis of ingredient relationship and their cooking/cutting methods. The user studies, which recruit real users to cook dishes by using Pic2Dish, shows the usefulness of the app.\n\n",

Given the popularity of personal hand-held devices, mobile applications provide a promising low-cost solution to tackle the key risk factor by diet monitoring. In this work, we propose a photo based dietary tracking system that employs deep-based image recognition algorithms to recognize food and analyze nutrition. The system is beneficial for patients to manage their dietary and nutrition intake, and for the medical institutions to intervene and treat the chronic diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there are no popular applications in the market that provide a high-performance food photo recognition like ours, which is more convenient and intuitive to enter food than textual typing. We conducted experiments on evaluating the recognition accuracy on laboratory data and real user data on Singapore local food, which shed light on uplifting lab trained image recognition models in real applications. In addition, we have conducted user study to verify that our proposed method has the potential to foster higher user engagement rate as compared to existing apps based dietary tracking approaches.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the objects and relations between them is indispensable to fine-grained video content analysis, which is widely studied in recent research works in multimedia and computer vision. However, existing works are limited to evaluating with either small datasets or indirect metrics, such as the performance over images. The underlying reason is that the construction of a large-scale video dataset with dense annotation is tricky and costly. In this paper, we address several main issues in annotating objects and relations in user-generated videos, and propose an annotation pipeline that can be executed at a modest cost. As a result, we present a new dataset, named VidOR, consisting of 10k videos (84 hours) together with dense annotations that localize 80 categories of objects and 50 categories of predicates in each video. We have made the training and validation set public and extendable for more tasks to facilitate future research on video object and relation recognition.\n\n",

Multilayer structures of the MIM thick film capacitors are demonstrated and discussed. Results of the frequency\n characteristics test show that the MIM thick film capacitors fabricated by the LMCEP process have excellent direct current\n (DC) voltage stability (<2.48%), excellent frequency stability (<2.6%) and low dissipation factor (<0.6%), which are sufficient\n for many megahertz applications.",

The effects of the UV laser microprocessing parameters, including laser power density, frequency, laser scanning speed, and pass delay on microprocessing accuracy and quality (kerf width and arithmetic average roughness R a on the kerf sidewall) were investigated by means of a 4\u00d74 orthogonal design. The key processing parameters were determined and optimized for small kerf width and minimal R a of the kerf sidewall while retaining high production efficiency. Subsequent chemical etching of the laser processed areas was performed to reduce the kerf surface and kerf sidewall roughness by removing debris and the thin recast layer for the required size precision and post gilding treatment. The results showed that a clean surface and crack-free kerf sidewall with roughness R a of 0.16\u03bcm could be achieved by laser microprocessing and chemical etching. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recently, mutations in several genes have been described to be associated with sporadic ASD, but some genetic variants remain to be identified. The aim of this study was to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) combined with bioinformatics analysis to identify novel genetic variants in cases of sporadic congenital ASD, followed by validation by Sanger sequencing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five Han patients with secundum ASD were recruited, and their tissue samples were analyzed by WES, followed by verification by Sanger sequencing of tissue and blood samples. Further evaluation using blood samples included 452 additional patients with sporadic secundum ASD (212 male and 240 female patients) and 519 healthy subjects (252 male and 267 female subjects) for further verification by a multiplexed MassARRAY system. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify novel genetic variants associated with sporadic ASD. RESULTS From five patients with sporadic ASD, a total of 181,762 genomic variants in 33 exon loci, validated by Sanger sequencing, were selected and underwent MassARRAY analysis in 452 patients with ASD and 519 healthy subjects. Three loci with high mutation frequencies, the 138665410 FOXL2 gene variant, the 23862952 MYH6 gene variant, and the 71098693 HYDIN gene variant were found to be significantly associated with sporadic ASD (P<0.05); variants in FOXL2 and MYH6 were found in patients with isolated, sporadic ASD (P<5\u00d710^-4). CONCLUSIONS This was the first study that demonstrated variants in FOXL2 and HYDIN associated with sporadic ASD, and supported the use of WES and bioinformatics analysis to identify disease-associated mutations.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to continuous life stress often causes gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Studies have shown that neuropeptide Y (NPY) counteracts the biological actions of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), and is involved in the termination of the stress response. However, in chronic repeated restraint stress (CRS) conditions, the actions of NPY on GI motility remain controversial. To evaluate the role of NPY in mediation of the adaptation mechanism and GI motility in CRS conditions, a CRS rat model was set up. Central CRF and NPY expression levels were analyzed, serum corticosterone and NPY concentrations were measured, and GI motor function was evaluated. The NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP-3226 was centrally administered before stress loading, and on days, 1-5, of repeated stress, the central CRF and the serum corticosterone concentrations were measured. In addition, gastric and colonic motor functions were evaluated. The elevated central CRF expression and corticosterone concentration caused by acute stress began to fall after 3 days of stress loading, while central NPY expression and serum NPY began to increase. GI dysmotility also returned to a normal level. Pretreatment with BIBP-3226 abolished the adaptation mechanism, and significantly increased CRF expression and the corticosterone concentration, which resulted in delayed gastric emptying and accelerated fecal pellet output. Inhibited gastric motility and enhanced distal colonic motility were also recorded. CRS-produced adaptation, over-expressed central CRF, and GI dysmotility observed in acute restraint stress were restored to normal levels. Central NPY via the Y1 receptor plays an important role in mediating the adaptation mechanism against chronic stress.",

We have recently demonstrated that p-CDC25B-Ser351 is located at the centrosomes of mouse oocytes and contributes to the release of mouse oocytes from prophase I arrest. But much less is known about CDC25B function at the centrosome in two-cell stage mouse embryos. Here we investigate the effect of CDC25B regulating the microtubules nucleation. Microinjection of anti-CDC25B antibody caused aberrant microtubule nucleation. In addition, embryos injected with anti-CDC25B antibody showed the marked absence of microtubule repolymerization and Nek2 foci after nocodazole washout. CDC25B overexpression caused microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) overduplication. Moreover, overexpression of CDC25B-\u25b565 mutant resulted in the loss of CDC25B localization in the perinuclear region and made CDC25B less efficient in inducing mitosis. We additionally identified that CDC25B is responsible for the pericentrin localization to the MTOC. Our data suggest an important role of CDC25B for microtubule nucleation and organization. N-terminal of CDC25B is required for regulating the microtubule dynamics and mitotic function.",

Aiming at the stillbirths in fat-1 transgenic foetuses of sheep, we detected the DNA methylation levels of candidate CpG regions in five imprinted genes (h19, igf2, igf2r, dlk1 and gtl2) of diverse tissues in the sheep foetuses, including both male and female fat-1 transgenic stillbirths of sheep and the wild live-births of sheep. Imprinted gene igf2, igf2r and dlk1 exhibited gender-neutral methylation except h19, which implies that the deregulated DNA methylation influenced by exogenous gene fat-1 in imprinted gene h19 more likely differs with gender. Besides, we found that exogenous gene fat-1 could tend to influence DNA methylation of imprinted gene igf2r in kidney of sheep male-foetus by comparing number of differentially methylated CpG sites. Since the bio-function of fat-1 on growth is consistent with h19 and igf2r, but opposite with igf2 and dlk1, we suggest that the stillbirth risk factors on sheep foetus with exogenous gene fa...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Steam reforming of ethylene glycol was investigated over Ni-based catalysts supported on Attapulgite (ATP; originating from Jiangsu (JS), Anhui, and Gansu (GS) provinces in China). N 2  adsorption\u2013desorption, XRD, FTIR, H 2 -TPR, NH 3 -TPD, SEM, and TEM-EDS measurements were performed to analyze the catalyst properties. The results revealed that Ni/ATP GS  had the largest particle size (17.9\u00a0nm) and the highest reductive degree (98.0%). Consequently, Ni/ATP GS  showed the highest ethylene glycol conversion (97.2%) during the first 4\u00a0h of reaction. However, this catalyst showed the lowest H 2  yield (71.2%), possibly owing to large Ni particle sizes as well as ample surface acidic sites and acidity, leading to a high selectivity toward CH 4  (20.8%) and C 2 H 4  (2.2%). In contrast, Ni/ATP JS  presented the highest H 2  yield (89.8%) owing to it having the smallest Ni particle sizes and lowest amount of surface acidic sites. Additionally, this catalyst showed the highest stability over 8\u00a0h of reaction. An examination of the spent catalysts revealed that Ni/ATP JS  possessed excellent antisintering and coking properties.",

The results revealed that CoO/m-SEP had appropriate surface acidity and a larger pore diameter than m-SEP. As expected, CoO/m-SEP showed the highest degree of lignin liquefaction (74.25%) and yield of the petroleum ether soluble product (8.18%) as well as the lowest char yield (11.23%) under the same reaction conditions.

        "abstract": "Functional materials capable of responding to stimuli intrinsic to diseases are extremely important for specific drug delivery at the disease site. However, developing on-demand stimulus-responsive vectors for targeted delivery is highly challenging. Here, a stimulus-responsive fluorinated bola-amphiphilic dendrimer is reported for on-demand delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in response to the characteristic high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells. This dendrimer bears a ROS-sensitive thioacetal in the hydrophobic core and positively charged poly(amidoamine) dendrons at the terminals, capable of interacting and compacting the negatively charged siRNA into nanoparticles to protect the siRNA and promote cellular uptake. The ROS-sensitive feature of this dendrimer boosts specific and efficient disassembly of the siRNA/vector complexes in ROS-rich cancer cells for effective siRNA delivery and gene silencing. Moreover, the fluorine tags in the vector enable 19F-NMR analysis of the ROS-responsive delivery process. In addition, this ingenious and distinct bola-amphiphilic dendrimer is also able to combine the advantageous delivery features of both lipid and dendrimer vectors. Therefore, it represents an innovative on-demand stimulus-responsive delivery platform.",

        "abstract": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics hold great promise to treat a variety of diseases, as long as they can be delivered safely and effectively into cells. Dendrimers are appealing vectors for siRNA delivery by virtue of their well-defined molecular architecture and multivalent cooperativity. However, the clinical translation of RNA therapeutics mediated by dendrimer delivery is hampered by the lack of dendrimers that are of high quality to meet good manufacturing practice standard. In this context, we have developed small amphiphilic dendrimers that self-assemble into supramolecular structures, which mimic high-generation dendrimers synthesized with covalent construction, yet are easy to produce in large amount and superior quality. Indeed, the concept of supramolecular dendrimers has proved to be very promising, and has opened up a new avenue for dendrimer-mediated siRNA delivery. A series of self-assembling supramolecular dendrimers have consequently been established, some of them out-performing the currently available nonviral vectors in delivering siRNA to various cell types in vitro and in vivo, including human primary cells and stem cells. This short review presents a brief introduction to RNAi therapeutics, the obstacles to their delivery and the advantages of dendrimer delivery vectors as well as our bio-inspired structurally flexible dendrimers for siRNA delivery. We then highlight our efforts in creating selfassembling amphiphilic dendrimers to construct supramolecular dendrimer nanosystems for effective siRNA delivery as well as the related structural alterations to enhance delivery efficiency. The advent of self-assembling supramolecular dendrimer nanovectors holds great promise and heralds a new era of dendrimer-mediated delivery of RNA therapeutics in biomedical applications.",

This subspecies has strong growth and regeneration ability, high tiller numbers, high protein and lysine content as well as resistance to many fungal diseases, and it can be effectively used in maize improvement. In this study, we reported a  ssp.  L. transcriptome by merging data from untreated control (CK), cold (4\u00b0C) and drought (PEG2000, 20%) treated plant samples. A total of 251,145 transcripts (N50 = 1,269 bp) and 184,280 unigenes (N50 = 923 bp) were predicted, which code for homologs of near 47% of the published maize proteome. Under cold conditions, 2,232 and 817 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, while fewer genes were up-regulated (532) and down-regulated (82) under drought stress, indicating that  ssp.  L. is more sensitive to the applied cold rather than to the applied drought stresses. Functional enrichment analyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets in response to drought and cold stresses. The ABA dependent pathway, trehalose synthetic pathway and the ICE1-CBF pathway were up-regulated by both stresses. GA associated genes have been shown to differentially regulate the responses to cold in close subspecies in . These findings and the identified functional genes can provide useful clues for improving abiotic stress tolerance of maize.",

        "abstract": "The annual Zea mays ssp. mexicana L. is a member of teosinte, a wild relative of the Zea mays spp. mays L. This subspecies has strong growth and regeneration ability, high tiller numbers, high protein and lysine content as well as resistance to many fungal diseases, and it can be effectively used in maize improvement. In this study, we reported a Zea mays ssp. mexicana L. transcriptome by merging data from untreated control (CK), cold (4\u2103) and drought (PEG2000, 20%) treated plant samples. A total of 251,145 transcripts (N50 = 1,269 bp) and 184,280 unigenes (N50 = 923 bp) were predicted, which code for homologs of near 47% of the published maize proteome. Under cold conditions, 2,232 and 817 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, while fewer genes were up-regulated (532) and down-regulated (82) under drought stress,indicating that Zea mays ssp. mexicana L. is more sensitive to the applied cold rather than to the applied drought stresses. Functional enrichment analyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets in response to drought and cold stresses. The ABA dependent pathway, trehalose synthetic pathway and the ICE1-CBF pathway were up-regulated by both stresses. GA associated genes have been shown to differentially regulate the responses to cold in close subspecies in Zea mays. These findings and the identified functional genes can provide useful clues for improving abiotic stress tolerance of maize.",

        "title": "Comparative proteomic analysis reveals differential protein and energy metabolisms from two tobacco cultivars in response to cold stress",
        "abstract": "Low temperature is an important abiotic stress for plant development and has serious effects on crop production. Because tobacco is sensitive to low temperature, it is suitable for analyzing the mechanisms of cold response in plants. In the current study, NC567 and Taiyan8, two cultivars with different sensitivities to low temperature, were used in Isobaric\u00a0Tags\u00a0for\u00a0Relative\u00a0and\u00a0Absolute\u00a0Quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics to uncover their different mechanisms in response to cold stress. A total of 4317 distinct proteins were identified and the differentially expressed proteins in four comparison sets were used for further analysis. The gene\u00a0ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were in the categories involved in metabolic and cellular processes. Surprisingly, there were 55 proteins decreased in NC567, but increased in Taiyan8 in response to cold, while the levels of 42 proteins were lower in Taiyan8 than NC567 at normal temperature, but higher in Taiyan8 than NC567 under cold treatment, suggesting different responses to cold stress in these cultivars. The levels of polypeptides involved in protein synthesis and degradation, photosynthesis, and respiration, as well as ROS scavenging, were different in the comparison sets, implying that protein and energy metabolisms may be important for the establishment of cellular environment at low temperature. In conclusion, our study identified the potential pathways involved in low-temperature response of tobacco and provides hints for the further improvement of cold tolerance in crops.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop appropriate protocols for flow cytometric (FCM) and 16S rDNA sequencing investigation of the microbiome in a powdered infant formula (PIF) production facility. Twenty swabs were collected from each of the three care zones of a PIF production facility and used for preparing composite samples. For FCM studies, the swabs were washed in 200 mL phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The cells were harvested by three-step centrifugation followed by a single stage filtration. Cells were dispersed in fresh PBS and analyzed with a flow cytometer for membrane integrity, metabolic activity, respiratory activity and Gram characteristics of the microbiome using various fluorophores. The samples were also plated on agar plates to determine the number of culturable cells. For 16S rDNA sequencing studies, the cells were harvested by centrifugation only. Genomic DNA was extracted using a chloroform-based method and used for 16S rDNA sequencing studies. Compared to the dry low and high care zones, the wet medium care zone contained a greater number of viable, culturable, and metabolically active cells. Viable but non-culturable cells were also detected in dry-care zones. In total, 243 genera were detected in the facility of which 42 were found in all three care zones. The greatest diversity in the microbiome was observed in low care. The genera present in low, medium and high care were mostly associated with soil, water, and humans, respectively. The most prevalent genera in low, medium and high care were Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Streptococcus, respectively. The integration of FCM and metagenomic data provided further information on the density of different species in the facility. ",

        "abstract": "Cronobacter sakazakii  is a xerotolerant neonatal pathogen epidemiologically linked to powdered infant food formula, often resulting in high mortality rates. Here, we used RNA-seq to provide transcriptional insights into the survival of  C. sakazakii  in desiccated conditions. Our RNA-seq data shows that about 22% of the total  C. sakazakii  genes were significantly up-regulated and 9% were down-regulated during desiccation survival. When qRT-PCR was used to validate the RNA-seq data, we found that the primary desiccation response was gradually down-regulated during the tested four hours of desiccation while the secondary response remained constitutively up-regulated. The 4-hour desiccation tolerance of  C. sakazakii  was dependent on the immediate microenvironment surrounding the bacterial cell. Removal of TSB salts and the introduction of sterile infant formula residues in the microenvironment enhanced the desiccation survival of  C. sakazakii  SP291. The trehalose biosynthetic pathway encoded by  otsA  and  otsB , a prominent secondary bacterial desiccation response, was highly up-regulated in desiccated  C. sakazakii .  C. sakazakii  SP291 \u0394 otsAB  was significantly inhibited compared to the isogenic wild type in an eight hour desiccation survival assay confirming the physiological importance of trehalose in desiccation survival. Overall, we provide a comprehensive RNA-seq based transcriptional overview along with confirmation of the phenotypic importance of trehalose metabolism in  Cronobacter sakazakii  during desiccation.   IMPORTANCE  Cronobacter sakazakii  is a pathogen of importance to neonatal health that is known to persist in dry food matrices such as powdered infant formula (PIF) and its associated production environment. When infections are reported in neonates, mortality rates can be high. The success of this bacterium in surviving these low-moisture environments suggests that  Cronobacter  species can respond to a variety of environmental signals. Therefore, understanding those signals that aid persistence of this pathogen in these ecological niches, is an important step towards the development of strategies to reduce the risk of contamination of PIF. This research led to the identification of candidate genes that play a role in the persistence of this pathogen in desiccated conditions and, thereby, serve as a model target to design future strategies to mitigate PIF associated survival of  C. sakazakii .",

        "abstract": "Objective  To investigate whether chemokine CC motif 2 (CCL2) is involved in the high residual platelet response, and the mechanism of CCL2 being involved in the regulation of platelets. Methods  Forty patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were admitted. P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) was detected by VerifyNow. Forty patients were divided into high platelet reactivity group (high reactivity group, n=24) and normal platelet reactivity group (normal reactivity group, n=16) according to the results of PRU detection. Plasma CCL2 concentration of the STEMI patients was examined by ELISA. The expressions of CCL2 and CCR2 in the platelets were detected by Western blotting. After CCL2 stimulation, the kinases of which phosphorylation was changed in the platelets were screened by ARY003B protein chips. The phosphorylation of p38MAPK and HSP27 in the platelets was tested by Western blotting after CCL2 stimulation in the presence or absence of CCR2 antagonist (RS 102895) or p38MAPK signal pathway inhibitor (SB 203580). Results  The plasma CCL2 concentration of high reactivity group was markedly higher than that of normal reactivity group. Moreover, compared with normal reactivity group, the expressions of CCL2 and CCR2 in the platelets of high reactivity group significantly increased. After the platelets were stimulated by CCL2, the phosphorylation of p38\u03b1 and HSP27 enhanced in the platelets by protein chips screening. When RS 102895 or SB 203580 was treated before CCL2 stimulation, the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and HSP27 decreased. Conclusions  CCL2 participates in high residual platelet response in an autocrine/paracrine way. CCL2/CCR2 might affect the function of platelets through p38MAPK- HSP27 signal pathway.

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression is increased in activated monocytes, which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the mechanism remains unclear. Regulatory factor X1 (RFX1) is a critical transcription factor regulating epigenetic modifications. In this study, we investigated whether RFX1 and epigenetic modifications mediated by RFX1 contributed to the overexpression of TLR4 in activated monocytes.",
