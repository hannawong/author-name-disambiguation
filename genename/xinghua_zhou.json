        "abstract": "Because of the trait of denitrifying and phosphate-accumulating simultaneously,the requirement of carbon resources for denitrifying phosphate-accumulating organism(DPAO) will be minimized,which may provide a new routine to resolve the problem of lacking carbon resource. The discovery attracts many researchers\u2019attention. In this paper,a simple method of isolation for DPAO has been established. One pure denitrifying phosphate-accumulating organism(RC11) from pond sediment has been adopted,and the influences of external carbon resource and nitrate on the pure strain RC11 were studied. The results indicated that the strain RC11 could acquire energy from oxidizing external carbon resource using oxygen as electron accetpor directly to produce polyphosphate,but in anaerobic stage,the strain RC11 could not use nitrite as the electron acceptor to carry out denitrifying phosphorus uptake. With no external carbon resource,the strain RC11 could acquire energy from oxidizing PHB using nitrate as electron acceptor to produce polyphosphate,but phosphate will be released from cell in high concentration of nitrite because nitrite nitrogen could not be the electron acceptor to replace molecule oxygen;the strain RC11 could use nitrate as electron acceptor to produce polyphosphate in anaerobic stage.",

Five hundred and forty juvenile Erythroculter ilishaeformis with average initial body weight of (19.36 \u00b12. 17) g were randomly divided into 6 groups (group \u2160\uff5e\u2163) with 3 replicates of 30 fish in each replicate. Six groups were fed diets with 0, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% fish oil, respectively. EE levels of 6 diets were 2. 07% , 4. 28% , 7. 14% , 9. 26% , 11. 17% and 15. 32% , respectively. The experiment lasted for 60 days. The results showed that, weight gain ratio and specific growth ratio in group \u2162 were significantly higher than that in groups \u2160 , \u2161 , \u2164 and \u2165 (P<0. 05); feed conversion ratio in group \u2162 was significantly lower than that in groups \u2160 , \u2161 , \u2164 and \u2165 (P< 0.05); the protein efficiency ratio in group \u2163 was significantly higher than that in groups \u2160 , \u2161, \u2164 and \u2165 (P<0. 05). There was no significant difference between groups \u2162 and \u2163 in weight gain ratio, specific growth ratio, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio. The whole body lipid and protein contents were significantly affected by the dietary lipid supplementation levels (P<0. 05), while there were no significant effects on body moisture and ash content (P>0. 05). Based on regression analysis of the specific growth ratio, feed conversion efficiency, protein efficiency and the crude protein content of body composition, the optimal dietary supplementation levels of lipid were 7. 88% , 8. 12% , 9. 18% and 5. 68% , respectively.

        "abstract": "The experiment was conducted to study the effects of yeast nucleotide on growth performance, body composition and serum immune indices of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Six hundred healthy common carp [average body weight of (1.09\u00b10.07) g and average body length of (3.60\u00b10.34) cm] were randomly allotted to 6 groups and each group included 3 replicates with 30 fish. Fish in 6 groups were fed with basal diet supplemented with 0 (control group), 258, 516, 774, 1 032, and 1 290 mg/kg yeast nucleotide (effective components), respectively. The trial lasted for 50 days. The results showed as follows: compared with the control group, the weight gain ratio (WGR), specific growth ratio (SGR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of yeast nucleotide supplementation groups were significantly increased (P<0.05), at the same time, the feed conversion ratio (FCR)of yeast nucleotide supplementation groups was significantly decreased (P<0.05). The highest WGR, SGR and PER (372.03%, 3.10%/d and 195.74%, respectively) and the lowest FCR (1.42) of fish were found in 516 mg/kg group, and the differences were significant between 516 mg/kg group and the other groups (P<0.05). Based on broken-line model analysis of the WGR, SGR, PER and FCR, the optimal dietary yeast nucleotide supplemental levels for this formulation were 519.85 to 535.54 mg/kg. Body composition analysis showed that the crude ash and moisture contents in whole body were not affected by the supplementation of yeast nucleotide (P>0.05), but the crude protein and crude lipid contents were significantly higher with the increase of dietary yeast nucleotide supplemental level (516 to 1 290 mg/kg) than the control diet (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the activities of serum lysozyme (LSZ), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) of yeast nucleotide supplementation groups were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the activities of these enzymes were increased first and decreased afterwards with the dietary yeast nucleotide supplemental level increasing. Fish had higher activities of serum LSZ and SOD when the dietary yeast nucleotide supplemental levels were 774 to 1 290 mg/kg, at the same time, the fish had a higher serum CAT activity when fed 516 to 1 032 mg/kg yeast nucleotide supplemental diets. Based on the above information, the optimal dietary yeast nucleotide supplemental levels in common carp diets for optimum growth performance and immune ability are 519.85 to 774.00 mg/kg.",

The experiment lasted for 50 days. The results showed that the weight gain ratio (WGR) and specific growth ratio (SGR) in soybean oil group were the highest and the next was peanut oil group,but there was no significant difference between peanut oil group and sesame oil group (P>0.05); the feed conversion ratio (FCR) and the protein efficiency ratio (PER) in peanut oil group were the lowest and the highest respectively,and the next was sesame oil group,but there was no significant difference between sesame oil group and soybean oil group (P>0.05). Those results indicated that there was better growth performance of Schizothorax prenanti in soybean oil group,peanut oil group and sesame oil group. Serum biochemical indices analysis showed that the content of total cholesterol (TC) and activities of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) in soybean oil group were the lowest,and the activity of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in soybean oil group was the highest; at the same time,the triglyceride (TG) content in peanut oil group was the lowest,but there was no significantly difference between the peanut oil group and soybean oil group (P>0.05). The contents of TG,TC and the activities of GPT and GOT in rapeseed oil group and sunflower oil group were significantly higher than those in soybean oil group,peanut oil group and sesame oil group (P<0.05 or P<0.01); at the same time,the activity of HDL-C in rapeseed oil group and sunflower oil group was significantly lower than that in soybean oil group,peanut oil group and sesame oil group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The results indicated that rapeseed oil and sunflower oil had negative influence on lipid metabolism of Schizothorax prenanti. Based on the information above,soybean oil,peanut oil and sesame oil were the suitable lipid sources of Schizothorax prenanti.",

Two hundred wild Coreius heterodon with average weight of 146.81 g were temporarily fed 24 h for eliminating the contents of digestive canal. The intestine and hepatopancreas were took out for the preparation of the digestive juice sample. Fish meal,soybean meal,rapeseed meal and cottonseed meal were digested by enzymatic hydrolysis in vitro. The results showed that compared with the intestine,the hepatopancreas of Coreius heterodon possessed better enzymolysis ability for protein in feed ingredients. Moreover,the enzymolysis ability of middle intestine was the highest and the lowest in post intestine. The enzymolysis rate of fish meal (8.551 mg/h) in intestine within 0~4 h was higher than that of soybean meal,rapeseed meal and cottonseed meal,but the enzymolysis rate of soybean meal (13.110 mg/h) was the highest in hepatopancreas (P<0.05). The average enzymolysis rate of amino acid of the 4 kinds of protein in feed ingredients was 10.75,10.03,9.05,7.36 mg/h,respectively.

To further explore associated effects of LFBE on body weight and body fat distribution, and lipid profiles related metabolic outcomes, serum metabolites were analysed using LC-MS-MS and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Obese and lean groups were clearly discriminated from each other on PLS-DA score plot and major metabolites contributing to the discrimination were assigned as lipid metabolites (fatty acids), lipid metabolism intermediates (choline, betaine, carnitine and butyryl-carnitine), amino acids and citric acid. A high-fat diet increased lipid metabolites and decreased lipid metabolism intermediates, indicating that abnormal lipid metabolism induced by a high-fat diet resulted in fat accumulation via decreased \u03b2-oxidation. But LFBE can inhibit fat accumulation by reducing lipid metabolites and increasing lipid metabolism intermediates. Furthermore, the level changes of these metabolites can be used to assess the risk of obesity and the therapeutic effect of obesity management.",

Compositional analysis of TRS demonstrated that the content of resistant starch (RS) was significantly higher compared to conventional non-transgenic rice. High level of RS is an important raw material in food industry and has various physiological effects for human health. In order to provide the reliable theory basis for field release of TRS rice, we evaluated the potential health effects of long-term consumption of the TRS. The 90-day toxicology feeding experiment was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats fed with diets containing 70% of either TRS rice flour, its near-isogenic rice flour or the control diet. The clinical performance variables (body weight, body weight gain and food consumption) were measured and pathological responses (hematological parameters and serum chemistry at the midterm and the completion of the experiment, urinalysis profile and serum sex hormone response at the completion of the experiment) were performed. Besides, clinical signs, relative organ weights and microscopic observations were also compared between TRS group and its near-isogenic rice group. The combined data indicates that high-amylose TRS grain is as safe as the conventional non-transgenic rice for rat consumption. \u00a9 2011 .",

        "abstract": "Lysine-rich rice (LR) is a transgenic rice produced by fusion protein expressed genes into the germline of rice seeds. Compositional analysis of LR showed that the absolute concentration of lysine was significantly higher as compared to a near-isogenic non-transgenic rice. Lysine is believed to be the first limiting essential amino acid in rice, it is important to improve lysine content on rice nutritional quality. Here we report the results of a three generation study comparing the outcome in rats fed the transgenic rice to those fed conventional, near-isogenic rice or a control diet. In the study, both clinical performance variables and pathological responses such as body weight, food consumption, reproductive data, hematological parameters, serum chemistry and relative organ weights were examined respectively. It was evident that there were no adverse effects observed in rats that were fed transgenic rice compared with non-transgenic rice. There were significant differences in some hematology, serum chemistry parameters and relative organ weights in rats consuming the transgenic rice diet or non-transgenic rice diet compared with the control diet, but no macroscopic or histological adverse effects were observed. So the results from this study demonstrate that LR rice is as safe as near-isogenic non-transgenic rice. \u00a9 2012.",

The measured temperature and pressure along with the collocated GPS data from 2014 were collected from 25 observation stations evenly located in the region. Compared with the actual meteorological observations, the performances of the interpolated data from three reanalysis datasets differ marginally, with the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the interpolated surface temperature and pressure less than 2.4\u00a0K and 1.6\u00a0hPa, respectively; however, the RMSEs of the surface temperature and pressure interpolated from the GPT2 model were 3.0\u00a0K and 4.2\u00a0hPa, respectively. Data based on GPS PWV products that used the meteorological parameters interpolated from three reanalysis data were very close to those of meteorological observations, with biases within \u00b1\u20090.4\u00a0mm and RMSEs below 0.5\u00a0mm in most areas, and the RMSE of PWV using the GPT2 model interpolation data was superior by 2\u00a0mm. The measurement of GPS PWV using the interpolated reanalysis meteorological data also compared well with radiosonde observations, with RMSE between them tending to increase with a decrease of the GPS station\u2019s latitude. However, the GPS PWV based on the interpolated data could not reflect the true change in water vapor during typhoon events.",

In order to generate the transformed matrix, the three axes should be sequentially rotated. There are three different styles of axis rotation. If inappropriate rotation angles are used in those rotations, it will produce incorrect transformation results. In the paper, the errors, caused by rotation, are firstly discussed. Then, the formulae of rotation angles are derived for two popular cases in the ocean surveying. It is the function of pitch and roll angles. In the end, the errors are analyzed because of the formula simplification. The error, caused by the first case, is smaller than that of the second one. So the first simplification model is recommended in the application, if the required position is not accurate enough.",

Using the seafloor-backscattered data from each beam and with automatic classification, seabed sediments distribution maps can be obtained directly. In this paper, the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used in acoustic seafloor classification from multibeam sonar data. This method can rapidly identify all kinds of seafloor types such as mud, sand, gravel and rock in the experimental surveying areas. Compared with the traditional geologic grab method, the experiment indicates that the SOM method is feasible and valid.",

The adjoint equations were derived from the two-dimensional tidal equations by Lagrange multiplier method. The observation data were from the tidal gauge stations and the satellite altimetry data. To evaluate the role of the altimetry data and the tidal gauge data in the data assimilation of the tides in the Bohai Sea, three numerical experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 only assimilates the tidal gauge data, Experiment 2 only assimilates the altimetry data, and Experiment 3 assimilates the combined data of the tidal gauge stations and the satellite altimetry. The tidal constituents M2, S2, K1 and O1 of the Bohai Sea were simulated. The results show that it is better when assimilating the tidal gauge data and the altimetry data simultaneously than assimilating any one separately. The mean absolute differences of the amplitude and phase-lag are 1.52 cm and 2.22\u00b0 for M2, 1.26 cm and 3.30\u00b0 for S2, 1.19 cm and 2.72\u00b0 for K1, 0.55 cm and 1.93\u00b0 for O1, respectively. The results reflect the tidal system of the Bohai Sea well, especially for the outer sea area since the altimetry data were assimilated.",

A general ART-based neural network, Fuzzy ARTMAP, has been proposed for seafloor classification of multibeam sonar data. An evolutionary strategy was used to generate new training samples near the cluster boundaries of the neural network, therefore the weights can be revised and refined by supervised learning. The proposed method resolves the training problem for Fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks, which are applied to seafloor classification of multibeam sonar data when there are less than adequate ground-truth samples. The results were synthetically analyzed in comparison with the standard Fuzzy ARTMAP network and a conventional Bayesian classifier. The conclusion can be drawn that Fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks combining with genetic algorithms (GA) can be alternative powerful tools for seafloor classification of multibeam sonar data.",

In GPS observation\n equation, the unknown parameters can be separated into two parts: global parameters and local parameters. The global parameters\n include orbit, satellite clock and geodynamic parameters. The local parameters are site-occupation-spectific, such as position,\n tropospheric delay, etc. The formulas of local parameters are firstly derived under the network-solution and the PPP-solution\n conditions respectively. If the weight matrix of global parameters in PPP-solution is small enough, the cofactor matrices\n of local parameters are the same as that in network-solution. Then, 16 daily solutions are obtained in both PPP mode and network\n mode. Three sites are selected to compare the solutions. The experimental results demonstrated that the difference between\n two solutions in coordinates and tropospheric delays are only few millimeters. This level of difference can be neglected so\n that the solutions from both PPP mode and network mode can be taken as the same in the actual application.",

In this paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the initial values of LVQ. The GA-based LVQ can rapidly provide the most optimized initial reference vectors and accurately identify many types of seafloor, such as rock, gravel, sand, fine sand and mud in survey areas. The proposed new approach has been applied to seafloor classification using Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES) backscatter data in Jiaozhou Bay near Qingdao City of China.

In the period from 1997-2002, eight institutes and companies in the country joined together and carried out a key project entitled 'Seabed Topographic Survey in the waters off China using Multi-beam Echo Sounders.' Many new topographic units were discovered under this project such as seamounts, seabed plateaux, sea mountain ranges, and great valleys. Along with the development of the national economy, submarine optical-fiber cables have also developed rapidly in China. Multi-beam echo sounders have been widely used in earlier stage of topographic survey along planned cable routes. These sounders have also found applications to monitor changes in seabed topography to need marine engineering needs with high resolution and high accuracy. The potential advantages of such sounders have led them to be widely applied in underwater engineering and object detection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water vapor plays an important role in climate change; thus, studying the spatial distribution and temporal variation of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the coastal regions of China would help researchers to understand the climate characteristics of those regions. In this paper, 6-year 1-h interval PWV were derived from 27 Global Positioning System stations observations of Chinese coastal GPS observation network, surface meteorological data and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-Interim) reanalysis products. The present study provides the use of these data to investigate the spatial-temporal variability of water vapor throughout the coastal regions of China. Latitude is the main factor affecting the spatial distribution of GPS-derived PWV; that is, PWV decreased by about 1.5\u00a0mm for each 1\u00b0 increase of latitude. For regions at the same latitude, a region that is relatively close to the ocean will have a higher content of PWV. The PWV in the southeastern and southwestern coastal regions of China is significantly higher in summer; this may be influenced by the southeastern and southwestern water vapor inflow corridors. The PWV obviously varies monthly, reaching a minimum in January; however, the timing of the maximum varied but usually appeared in June, July or August and was affected by the monsoons. The PWV varies largely between summer and winter with a larger gradient of change in PWV with latitude in winter than in summer. The positive correlation coefficient between PWV and the surface temperature varied in different seasons; this is related to the changes of temperature and the horizontal motion of water vapor. Use of the Fast Fourier Transform method showed that the PWV time series data have multi-scale characteristics. The amplitude and phase of the PWV time series in annual, semiannual, four month and seasonal cycles were extracted through harmonic wave analysis. The amplitude of four month and seasonal cycles did not pass significance testing. The maximum amplitude of the annual PWV cycle is located in mid-latitudes with 22.09\u00a0mm, which gradually decreases towards high latitude and equator area. The peak time of annual PWV cycle occurs in July, which does not agree with the timing of the maximum monthly average PWV. The semiannual cycle amplitudes is between 0.42 and 6.32\u00a0mm, with no significant correlation between their distribution and latitude. The peak time of semiannual PWV cycles is during about January\u2013March and July\u2013September, and the peak time gradually becomes late from north to south.",

Thus a specific measurement method cannot be implemented effectively, which affects the integrity and precision of island coastline surveying. In this paper, we use the digital elevation Model (DEM) by LIDAR date. However, The elevations acquired by an Airborne LIDAR system are ellipsoid heights, which is different from the National Vertical Datum 1985 in existing island coastline. For this reason, a regional quasi-geoid model is constructed with the geometric method, using the EGM2008 gravity field model and GPS/Leveling data. We manage to transform ellipsoid heights to normal heights from observations, and construct the DEM which is based on National Vertical Datum 1985. Finally island coastlines are extracted from the reference DEM and the associated tidal model and compared with that from GPS-RTK measurements. \u00a9 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

At present there are mainly four absolute calibration sites over the world, which have been providing absolute biases for multiple satellite altimeters from the T/P mission (1992\u20132005) to the Jason-3 mission launched in 2016. After HY-2A, launched in 2011 and stopped working in 16 March 2016, China has been planning to build two absolute calibration sites over the China north and south sea area. The Dangan Island, located at the South China Sea, and the QianliYan Island, located at the Yellow Sea in the north China sea area, have been chosen to be the calibration sites of Chinese satellite altimetry missions. The Dangan site aims to service the Chinese HY-2 altimetry series missions and is still under construction. However, beside the Chinese HY-2 missions the Qianliyan site could calibrate the international altimetry missions including the Jason series and Saral/AltiKa. In this paper the calibration methodology, data and models, and the absolute bias of HY-2A, Jason-2, and Saral/AltiKa based on the Qianliyan CAL/VAL site will be presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work presents the first calibration results for the Jason-2 and the SARAL/AltiKa altimetric missions by using the permanent calibration facilities on the Qianli Yan islet (China). Qianli Yan is located in the Yellow Sea and only \u223c3\u00a0km from the Jason-2 and SARAL/AltiKa crossover point. Analysis of the Jason-2 and SARAL/AltiKa waveform data and geophysical data over the Qianli Yan calibration area has proven that the altimeters and microwave radiometers are not contaminated by the mainland or the islet. The accuracies of the regional geoid model, provided by the First Institute of Oceanography (FIO), State Oceanic Administration of China, and the DTU10 MSS model were assessed by a GNSS buoy experiment. The results indicated that the FIO model is suitable for altimeter calibration in the Qianli Yan area. From the observations and the geoid model, the absolute biases for the Jason-2 and SARAL/AltiKa altimeters (2013\u20132014) were determined as 21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9 and \u221244.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3\u00a0mm, respectively. The 2\u00a0years\u2019 results indicated that the Jason-2 bias had no trend. However, the SARAL/AltiKa bias presented a downward trend that was more stable in 2014 than in 2013. The Qianli Yan results are consistent with those determined by other international dedicated calibration sites and crossover analysis.",

        "abstract": "Sub-bottom profiler (SBP) is an acoustic instrument commonly used to survey underwater shallow geological structure and embedded objects whose most important performance parameter is the actual vertical resolution. This paper presented a methodology to measure and evaluate the actual vertical resolution of SBP based on an experiment in an anechoic tank, which was divided into three components: building of artificial geological model, measurement of acoustic parameters, and determination of actual vertical resolution of the acoustic profiles. First, the wedge-shaped geological model, whose thickness could be accurately controlled, was designed and built in an anechoic tank to try to directly measure the vertical resolution of SBP. Then, the acoustic pulse width of SBP was measured to calculate the theoretical general vertical resolution and extreme vertical resolution. Finally, based on the acoustic profiles obtained in the experiment, the method which was used to evaluate the actual vertical resolution by measuring the duration of reflection event was put forward. Due to comparing measurement data of different parameter settings of the SBP, the study has revealed that the SBP had the lowest resolution in the 4 kHz-500 \u03bcs setting, which was 226.5 \u03bcs, or 36.2 cm, and the highest resolution in the 15 kHz-67 \u03bcs setting, which was 72.7 \u03bcs, or 11.6 cm. The vertical resolution decreased with the increase of the pulse width. The results also showed that the actual resolution was close to the theoretical general resolution and far from the extreme resolution.",

        "abstract": "[Objective]The present experiment was conducted to study the sensitivity of Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae to metalaxlyl in Guangxi in order to apply the proper control measures for its spread. [Method]Sensitivity of 196 Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae strains isolated from the main tobacco areas of Guangxi to metalaxlyl was tested by observing the growth rate of fungal strains. [Result]EC50 values of 196 isolates ranged from 0.0691 to 1.0243 \u03bcg/mL, and the mean EC50 value was 0.3618\u00b10.0297 \u03bcg/mL. The isolate TL05 from Tianlin County was the most sensitive one, with the EC50 value of 0.0691 \u03bcg/mL, while the isolate ZXHD12 from Huadong Town, Jingxi County was the most resistant, with the EC50 value of 1.0243 \u03bcg/mL. A significant difference among the sensitivities of isolates from different sites has been observed. The isolates from Nandan and Tianlin County were the most sensitive, while those from Longlin, Jingxi, Debao and Fuchuan County were the most resistant. The frequencies of sensitive, intermediate and resistant isolates to metalaxyl were 1.53, 66.84 and 31.63%, respectively. [Conclusion]A low level of resistance to metalaxyl has been observed in Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae in Guangxi. It is, therefore, suggested that metalaxyl should be alternated with other fungicides for proper control of the tobacco black shank.",

The derived dialkylaminotetraene-type nonlinear optical chromophores possess an all-trans conformation and can be functionalized with fluoro-dendron to provide proper shape modification for poling. Polymers doped with two examples of these chromophores in high concentrations have been poled to afford ultra-large electrooptic coefficients (r(33)) of 208 and 262 pm/V, respectively, at the measuring wavelength of 1.31 mum.",

A facile synthetic route has been explored to incorporate a methoxy group into the R position of such chromophores, which reduces their diene reactivity during the poling and lattice hardening process. The poled polymers with one of such chromophores doped in a cross-linked polymer lattice showed ultrahigh electro-optic activities, up to 306 pm/V at 1310 nm.",

        "abstract": "Increasing complexity in bottom-up molecular designs of amorphous structures with multiple relaxation modes demands an integrated and cognitive design approach, where chemical synthesis is guided by both analytical tools and theoretical simulations. In particular, this is apparent for novel organic second-order nonlinear optical materials of self-assembling molecular glasses involving dendritic arene stabilization moieties (phenyl, naphthyl, and anthryl) with electro-optical activities above 300 pm/V. In this study, nanoscale thermo-mechanical analyses yield direct insight into the molecular enthalpic and entropic relaxation modes. Arene-perfluoroarene interactions for coarse self-assembly are found to impose three phase relaxation regimes, with intermediate regimes of 8-15 degrees C in width and apparent activation energies between 40 and 60 kcal/mol to be the most effective for poling. Energetic analyses based on intrinsic friction microscopy (IFA) identify increasing temporal stability with increasing arene size for the low-temperature regime. Electric field poling efficiency is found to be inversely proportional to entropic cooperative contributions that can make up 80% of the overall apparent relaxation energy for the high-temperature regime. The origin for the activation energies below the incipient glass transition temperature, based on complementary molecular dynamic simulations, is tied primarily to noncovalent interactions between chromophore (dipole), dendritic (quadrupole) moieties, and combinations thereof.",

        "title": "Star-shaped oligo(p-phenylene)-functionalized truxenes as blue-light-emitting materials: synthesis and the structure\u2013property relationship",
        "abstract": "In this contribution, we described a strategy to prepare a series of well-defined, blue-light-emitting materials with truxene unit as the core and oligo( p -phenylene) (from one to four phenyl units) as the branches. The Suzuki coupling reactions between truxene bromide derivatives and phenylboronic acid or 1,1\u2032-biphenyl-4-boronic acid catalyzed by Pd(0) afforded the desired compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph and Tr - 4-Ph . With stepwise increases of the benzene rings, the desired molecules exhibited exceptional photophysical properties as well as increasing thermal stability. T g s increased from 39 \u00b0C for Tr-1-Ph to 192 \u00b0C for Tr-4-Ph . The absorption and the emission maximum peaks of these four compounds were red-shifted from the ultraviolet to the blue region with the increase of effective conjugation length. All results demonstrated that the physical properties were facilely tuned by connecting different types and different conjugated lengths to C-2, C-7, and C-12 positions of the truxene core. Graphical abstract 1 Introduction \u03c0-Conjugated organic materials have received intensive research interest both in academic and industry due to their potential application in a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic devices. 1 New synthetic methodologies and novel structures are continuously introduced into this blooming field. Most recently, star-shaped molecules have become an inspiring aspect of material chemistry because it can lead to a strong enhancement of physical properties. 2 Its combination with conjugated character within the arms brings novel electrical, optical, and morphological properties, as well as intrinsic two- or three-dimensional character. 3 Meanwhile, these monodisperse, well-defined \u03c0-conjugated oligomers serve as important and perfect model compounds for the corresponding conductive polymers, providing deep insight into the structure\u2013property relationship of conductive polymers. 4 Among \u03c0-conjugated organic materials with large energy band gaps, oligo- and poly- p -phenylene (PPP), 5,6 ladder-poly- p -phenylene (LPPP), 7 polyfluorene (PF), 8 and oligofluorene 9 derivatives have been recognized as the most promising blue-light emitters due to their high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, good charge transportation, thermal stability, and facile tunability of physical properties through chemical modification. Oligo( p -phenylenes), as mentioned above, an important class of conjugated redox and chromophore materials have been attracted considerable interests in the past decades. The well-defined models for poly( p -phenylenes) 10 not only achieved blue-light-emitting OLED in 1991, 6a and offered materials with chemically tailored properties, 11 but was also employed as rigid-rod building blocks for constructing novel supramolecules, 12 as well as for molecular wires or linkages or spacers in molecular electronics, 13 and as synthetic ionophores to facilitate ion migration through lipid bilayers, 14 and as chain-stiffening building blocks in liquid crystalline materials and semiflexible polymers to tailor properties such as crystallinity, fluorescence behavior, and stability. 15 Truxene, 10,15-dihydro-5 H -diindeno[1,2- a ;1\u2032,2\u2032- c ]fluorene, has been recognized as an attractive building block for the construction of novel \u03c0-conjugated star-shaped molecules due to its unique three-dimensional topology and easy functionalization at both methylene groups and C-2, C-7, and C-12 positions. Previously, it has been used as a potential starting material for the construction of bowl-shaped fragments of the fullerenes, 16 C 3 tripodal materials in asymmetric catalysis and chiral recognition, 17 and liquid crystalline compounds. 18 Some syn -trialkylated truxenes and sterically crowded 5,10,15-triarylated- and 5,10,15-tri(9-fluorenylidene) truxenes have been synthesized and their self-associate behavior in solution or reversible reduction behavior in cyclic voltammetry was carefully investigated. 19 Our group has successfully introduced oligothiophene arms to the truxene core 20a and developed novel \u03c0-conjugated truxene-based dendrimers, which have larger molecular weight for G1 ( M w =7908). 20b,c Therefore, Skabara and co-workers reported on employing the truxene core for the construction of virtually \u2018no-core\u2019 star-shaped oligofluorene architectures. 3a All these results and the ongoing research in our group show that truxene-based materials exhibit excellent photophysical properties, such as highly efficient emission and facile emissive wavelength tuning, high thermal and electrochemical stability, as well as ready synthesis, and demonstrate that truxene derivatives are an important class of organic light-emitting materials and their thermal and photophysical properties could be facilely tuned by connecting different types and lengths of conjugated chains to C-2, C-7, and C-12 positions of the truxene core. 3a,20 In this contribution, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of star-shaped oligo( p -phenylene)-functionalized truxenes, Tr- n -Ph ( Chart 1 ) with up to quaterphenylene arms, as potential blue-light-emitting materials. These nanosized macromolecules (radius 2.3 nm for Tr-4-Ph ) were still readily soluble in common organic solvents, exhibiting good film forming properties. Their absorption and emission properties and thermal stability, as well as structure\u2013property relationships, were investigated. The highly efficient blue-light emission, together with remarkably high T g , demonstrated these compounds as the promising candidates for blue-light-emitting materials. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Synthesis The synthetic route is sketched in Scheme 1 . The repetitive divergent approach was exploited to give the desired materials, which was similar to that reported by our group for the synthesis of star-shaped oligofluorenes in which the branch size was increased by repetitive addition of arm units to the star-shaped oligomer through the Suzuki coupling. 3d One of the barriers toward the full realization of oligo( p -phenylene)s\u2019 potential is their challenging synthesis and purification. 21 The difficulty associated with poor solubility of oligo( p -phenylene)s partially addressed by introducing various side chains to the phenylene unit. In this project, the problem was strategically circumvented by introducing six stretched hexyl chains to the truxene core prior to oligophenylene modification. First, truxene was alkylated to give readily soluble hexahexylated truxene and following subsequent bromination afforded hexahexylated truxene tribromide 1 in high yield as reported both in our previous contributions 22 and by Skabara et\u00a0al. 3a Phenylboronic acid and 1,1\u2032-biphenyl-4-boronic acid were readily prepared in excellent yield from the reaction of corresponding Grignard reagents with trimethyl borate followed by hydrolysis. The Suzuki cross-coupling reactions of 1 with phenyl or biphenylboronic acids afforded Tr-1-Ph and Tr-2-Ph , respectively. The method employing bromine in methylene chloride failed to give the desired bromides 2 and 3 . 1 H NMR spectrum showed that bromination occurred not only at the para site of the benzene unit but also at the C-4, C-9, and C-14 positions of the truxene core, which might be inferred from the appearance of a singlet at about \u03b4 8.7 ppm. This might be due to the relatively averaged electron density between the truxene core and the conjugated arms. For Tr-1-Ph , pure tribromide could not be obtained but instead, when excess bromine was applied, pure hexabromide was afforded. For Tr-2-Ph , excess bromine resulted in further bromination at the biphenyl unit. The similar polarity of our products made the separation very difficult. The attempt to iodinate Tr-1-Ph and Tr-2-Ph using I 2 /HIO 4 /HOAc also failed, in which both Tr-1-Ph and Tr-2-Ph aggregated and gave no reaction even in the presence of excess I 2 /HIO 4 after reflux for three days. In our recent report on the monodisperse star-shaped oligofluorenes, 3d alumina-supported copper(II) bromide was found to selectively brominate aromatic hydrocarbons at the outermost positions of the system under mild conditions. Its application in this system also gave very good results. After bromination, for Tr-1-Ph and Tr-2-Ph , the triplet centered at about \u03b4 7.40 ppm, which belongs to the para site protons of outermost benzene rings, gradually disappeared and the multiple signal arising around \u03b4 7.50 ppm moved downfield to about \u03b4 7.60 ppm while the doublet signals around \u03b4 8.45 ppm, which was assigned to the protons at C-3, C-8, and C-13 positions, did not show significant change. The convenient Suzuki cross-coupling 3d,20a,22 between tribromide compounds ( 2 and 3 ) with 1,1\u2032-biphenyl-4-boronic acid finally yielded Tr-3-Ph and Tr-4-Ph , respectively. Not only they were adequately characterized by the appropriate 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra and elemental analysis, MALDI-TOF MS measurement was also employed to determine the structure, the molecular weight, and the purity of these new compounds. 2.2 Photophysical properties The normalized absorption and emission spectra of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph in THF solutions are shown in Figure\u00a01 . They all showed strong \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 \u2217 electron absorption bands in the near violet region. The continuous red-shift of the absorption maximum was observed with a successive increase of benzene rings in each conjugated branch. The absorption maximums of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph were 326, 336, 340, and 341 nm, respectively, which were substantially red-shifted in comparison with those of benzene, biphenyl (246 nm), p -terphenyl (278 nm), and p -quaterphenyl (294 nm). 23 Considering the fact that the truxene core has an absorption maximum at 301 nm, we speculated that a highly extended \u03c0-delocalized system was formed throughout the truxene core, which contributed the most to the system's absorption. The band gaps for compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph of 3.20\u20133.49 eV, estimated from the red edge of the longest wavelength absorption in the electronic spectra in THF solutions, exhibited a perfect linear correlation ( r =0.999) with the inverse number of benzene units ( n ) in each conjugated arm as shown in Figure\u00a02 . The fitted linear equation as shown in Figure\u00a03 indicated a saturation limit for \u0394 E versus the number ( n ) of benzene rings, which could also be seen from the trend of the curve about the lowest energy transition versus the numbers of benzene rings in the conjugated branches. E (eV)=3.11+0.38/ n The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph exhibited a well-defined vibronic feature and the difference of peaks was enlarged with increase of benzene rings, which suggested the relative enhancement of vibronic transition. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that the emission spectra of truxene derivatives were liable to be tuned by introducing conjugated segments of different types and lengths. We also investigated the absorption and emission spectra of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph in films spin-coated from toluene solutions are shown in Figure\u00a04 . Similar red-shift trend with increase of benzene rings was also observed. For compounds Tr-1-Ph and Tr-2-Ph , their absorption maximum peaks in THF solutions were identical with those in solid states. Due to aggregation in solid states, PL spectra of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph in films were substantially red-shifted in comparison with those in solutions. Moreover, the molecular vibronic features disappeared for compounds Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph gave out bright blue emission with high quantum efficiency. The fluorescence quantum yields ( \u03a6 f ) in dilute THF solution using 9,10-diphenylanthracene ( \u03a6 f =0.91 in ethanol) as standard were measured to be 0.91 for Tr-1-Ph , 0.93 for Tr-2-Ph , 0.98 for Tr-3-Ph , and 0.96 for Tr-4-Ph , respectively, as summarized in Table 1 . 24 2.3 Thermal analysis In comparison with polymers, oligomers are more liable to form a crystalline state than polymers, which can scatter the light and limit charge injection and transport in OLEDs. Thus, oligomeric materials capable of demonstrating a glass transition state while resisting crystallization are more preferred. For the photoelectronic applications, the thermal stability of organic materials is critical for device stability and lifetime because during the electroluminescent process, heat is generated that can affect the material morphology and the device performance, finally leading to the degradation of OLEDs. 25 The rapid molecular motion near the glass\u00a0transition temperature ( T g ) might promote such morphological change. Hence, the relatively high T g is essential for materials used as emissive materials for optoelectronic applications. In this series of compounds, we found that Tr-1-Ph was somewhat crystalline while the other three compounds were amorphous at room temperature. The thermally induced phase transition behaviors of these compounds were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . In the first heating cycle, the samples had been heated to 300 \u00b0C and then allowed to slowly cool to room temperature to remove the residual solvent molecules and to afford stable amorphous phases. Typically, this cycle showed a weak and broad melting endothermic peak. It is at the second run when the residual solvents in samples had been removed that the amorphous phases could be observed. The T g of Tr-1-Ph was around 39 \u00b0C. Then the increasing length of rigid oligo( p -phenylene) units seemed to improve the glass transition temperature a great deal to 192 \u00b0C for Tr-4-Ph , which was quite remarkable. The differential scanning calorimetric thermogram of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph is shown in Figure\u00a05 . All the characterization of physical properties of compounds Tr-1-Ph , Tr-2-Ph , Tr-3-Ph , and Tr-4-Ph is summarized in Table 1 . 3 Conclusion In summary, we developed a series of well-defined, readily soluble, blue-light-emitting materials with truxene as the core and oligo( p -phenylene) as the branches employing the Suzuki cross-coupling reactions in good yields. The materials exhibited exceptional photophysical properties as well as good thermal stability. The absorption and emission spectra of these materials in THF solutions and in solid states were readily tuned by varying the number of phenyl units. The relatively narrow emission spectra as well as structure-unrelated features in solid states might be contributed to the star-shaped two-dimensional architecture, which also improved their amorphous properties. A significant increase of glass transition temperature ( T g ) was observed from 39 \u00b0C for Tr-1-Ph to 192 \u00b0C for Tr-4-Ph . Together with their excellent film forming property and free solubility in common organic solvents, these high-generation nanosized oligomers (radius\u22482.3 nm for Tr-4-Ph ) might be the promising candidates for blue-light-emitting materials. This work should also be of great interest and very helpful for the systematic investigation of structure\u2013property relationships. The investigation on their practical optoelectronic application is still ongoing. 4 Experimental section 4.1 General methods Commercial chemicals were purchased and used as received. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 (300 MHz) or 200 (200 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl 3 with TMS as the reference. Elemental analysis of all new compounds was performed on a Elementar Vario EL (Germany) instrument. Both the absorption and emission spectra were measured in the degassed dilute THF solution (about 1.0\u00d710 \u22126 mol/L) at room temperature and were recorded on Perkin\u2013Elmer Lambda 35 UV\u2013vis spectrometer and LS\u00a055 Luminescence Spectrometer. Fluorescence quantum yields ( \u03a6 f ) of the samples in THF solutions were measured by using 9,10-diphenylanthracene ( \u03a6 f =0.91 in ethanol) as standard. Values are calculated according to the following equation, where \u03a6 unk is the fluorescence quantum yield of the sample, \u03a6 std is the fluorescence quantum yield of 9,10-diphenylanthracene,\u00a0 I unk and I std are the integrated emission intensities of the sample and 9,10-diphenylanthracene, respectively; A unk and A std are the absorbance of the sample and 9,10-diphenylanthracene at the excitation wavelength, respectively, and \u03b7 unk and \u03b7 std are the refractive indexes of the corresponding solutions (pure solvents were assumed). \u03a6 unk = \u03a6 std ( I unk / A unk )( A std / I std )( \u03b7 unk / \u03b7 std ) 2 4.1.1 5,5,10,10,15,15-Hexahexyl-2,7,12-triphenyl-10,15-dihydro-5 H -diindeno[1,2- a ;1\u2032,2\u2032- c ]fluorene ( Tr-1-Ph ) To a degassed solution of 2,7,12-tribromo-5,5\u2032,10,10\u2032,15,15\u2032-hexahexyltruxene (4.0 g, 3.67 mmol) and 1-phenylboronic acid (2.7 g, 22.14 mmol) in 50 mL of THF were added Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 (30 mg) and 36 mL of 2 M aqueous Na 2 CO 3 solution.

        "abstract": "A facile approach to soluble star-shaped oligothiophene-functionalized polycyclic aromatics based on truxene is developed in this Communication. The Suzuki coupling reactions afford the thiophene-containing polycyclic aromatics with long branches (about 2.1 nm length from the heart to the periphery) from truxene precursor with excellent yields. The unsubstituted alpha-positions of thiophene rings allow for efficient halogenation and for further functionalization. The investigation of proton NMR spectra indicates that the hexahexyl groups efficiently prevent the self-association through the arene-arene pi-stacking. Chemical shifts belonging to methylene groups move more upfield than do those of methyl groups. These chemical shift values (about 0.5-0.6 ppm) are quite lower than those of normal methyl and methylene groups. We also prepare a dendritic hyperbranched polymer P1 through FeCl3 mediated oxidative polymerizations. The photophysical properties of all compounds possessing good symmetry are investigated by UV-vis and emission measurement.",

The core is a 9,9\u2032-spirobifiuorene and all the branching arms are affixed to the core in a single operation, which makes the syntheses highly convergent. The tetrahedral bonding atom at the center of a spiro-annulated molecule maintains 90\u00b0 angle between the connected conjugated moieties via a \u03c3-bonded network, which is useful to modify the steric demand of small molecular compounds to improve their processibility and morphologic stability, with their electronic properties maintained. Contrary to the non-substituted \u03b1-oligo-thiophenes, which naturally intend to crystallize, the oligothiophene modified 9,9\u2032-spirobifluorenes were found to readily form amorphous glasses at ambient temperature and to exhibit high morphological stability with high glass transition temperatures ranging from 101\u00b0C to 186\u00b0C. This series of materials also kept the good properties of oligothiophenes, such as the easy accessibility through various synthetic methodologies, good chemical and thermal stability, as well as the tunable energy levels and the emission color.",

        "abstract": "Two series of novel alternating polyfluorene copolymers containing 10,15-dihydro-5-H-diindeno[1,2-\u03b1;1\u2032,2\u2032-c]fluorene (truxene) moiety have been prepared through the Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki polymerization. The structure and purity of desired polymers is fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, UV-vis, and photoluminescent spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, elemental analyses, and TGA/DSC. The absorption and PL spectra of all polymers both in solutions and in thin films exhibit similar behaviors. For example, in solutions, the absorption spectra peak at about 360 nm, and the PL spectra show a maximum at about 390 nm with a shoulder at 412 nm. The introducing of the truxene moiety into polyfluorene and the hyperbranched and zigzag type molecular structures significantly reduce aggregation formation and enhance the thermal spectral stability of the desired polymers. They exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents as well as facile film forming properties. Bright blue emission is observed in both solution and solid states under UV excitation. The investigation of thermal spectral stability reveals that the long-wavelength emission upon thermal treatment usually observed in polyfluorene has been effectively reduced in our polymers.",

The unique NMR behaviors, physical properties, and electroluminescence device applications are also presented. Besides the purity, the structure, and the confirmation of the successful formation and isolation of desired compounds by clear assignments of every molecule by (1)H and (13)C and 2D NMR characterizations, several astonishing NMR behaviors have been observed in various solvents. For 1, chemical shift values belonging to H-2' of hexyl substituents move to the most upfield; however, such chemical shift values move from 0.48 to 0.85 ppm when pyridine-d(5) or benzene-d(6) is used as solvent. Our dendrimers as the emissive layers in organic light-emitting diodes gave blue-green light with an external quantum efficiency up to 0.16% both for G0 and for G1 in nitrogen, respectively, which exhibit unique electroluminescence spectra in comparison with their corresponding photoluminescence ones.",

        "abstract": "Two series of novel fully conjugated oligomers, oligothiophene-functionalized 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives, have been developed in this contribution. First, four 9,9'-spirobifluorene bromide derivatives (compounds 1a-d) are prepared through various synthetic routes. Oligothiophene derivatives with or without substituents are synthesized through the Grignard and Suzuki coupling reactions. The Negishi coupling reactions between oligothienylzinc chloride and various 9,9'-spirobifluorene bromides with Pd(PPh(3))(4) as catalyst successfully produce the desired compounds, unsubstituted oligothiophene-functionalized 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives, compounds 2 to 4a-d. Since the Negishi coupling reactions afford regioregularly head-to-tail (H-T) oligo(4-n-hexylthiophene)-functionalized 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives in poor yields, the Suzuki coupling reactions between sodium 4-n-hexylthienyl-2-boronate 8, and various 9,9'-spirobifluorene-based bromides 1a-d and 9-16 are employed to produce highly regioregular head-to-tail oligothiophene-functionalized 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives (compounds 5 to 7a-d) in very high yields. We also investigate the effect of solvents on the Suzuki coupling reactions. The structure and purity of all compounds are verified by FT-IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, MS, and elemental analysis.",

        "abstract": "Oligothiophene-functionalized 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives exhibit good solubility in polar organic solvents, especially compounds 5a-d to 7a-d due to the introduction of the flexible n-hexyl chain. The structures of all compounds studied are characterized and verified by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra. The results not only show that these organic conjugated materials with no substituents or n-hexyl substituents are successfully synthesized through the corresponding synthetic methodologies, but also prove that chemical shifts of protons and carbons in the aromatic range change with the attachment and the increase of the thiophene ring at the 9,9'-spirobifluorene fragment. The thermal analysis results demonstrate that these compounds are quite stable, and evaporate from 300 to 700 degrees C. Most of these compounds exhibit a stable amorphous state in the solid state. The electrochemical properties of all compounds studied are also investigated. The results indicate that radical cation behaviors of oligothiophene-modified 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives are more stable than those of normal oligothiophenes, that oxidative and reductive peak potentials shift cathodically or anodically, and that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are also tuned with the increase of the thiophene ring owing to the enhanced pi-electron delocalization and the increasing conjugation length. Oxidative potentials of nonsubstituted oligothiophene-functionalized 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives are more sensitive to the increase of thiophene rings than those of 9,9'-spirobifluorene derivatives with n-hexyl groups. The energy levels and band gaps of all compounds studied are also calculated from the onset potentials of n-doping and p-doping and are adjusted by varying thiophene oligomers and their attachment patterns to the 9,9'-spirobifluorene ring to make them suitable for the work functions of the electrodes.",

DCs treated with ApoB100 and interleukin-10 reduced proliferation of effector T cells, inhibited production of interferon-\u03b3, and increased de novo generation of regulatory T cells in vitro. Spleen cells from mice treated with DCs plus ApoB100 plus interleukin-10 showed diminished proliferative responses to ApoB100 and significantly dampened T-helper 1 and 2 immunity to ApoB100. Spleen CD4(+) T cells from these mice suppressed activation of ApoB100-reactive T cells in a manner characteristic of regulatory T cells, and mRNA analysis of lymphoid organs showed induction of transcripts characteristic of these cells. Treatment of huB100(tg) \u00d7 Ldlr(-/-) mice with ApoB100-pulsed tolerogenic DCs led to a significant (70%) reduction of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta, with decreased CD4(+) T-cell infiltration and signs of reduced systemic inflammation.Tolerogenic DCs pulsed with ApoB100 reduced the autoimmune response against low-density lipoprotein and may represent a novel possibility for treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involves inflammation and immune reactions. Low-density lipoproteins accumulate and are oxidized (oxLDL) in the arterial intima during hypercholesterolemia, leading to activation of endothelial cells, macrophages and T cells. We have previously found that severe hypercholesterolemia can induce a switch of autoimmune responses from T helper (Th)1 to Th2 effector type in atherosclerotic apoE knockout (E0) mice. The present study was performed to investigate whether Th3 immune effector responses and their inducing cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are affected by hypercholesterolemia.In E0 mice fed with high cholesterol diet and in C57BL/6J mice treated with poloxamer P-407, an agent that elevates plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, severe hypercholesterolemia led to elevated circulating TGF-beta1 levels, increased TGF-beta1(+)CD4(+) Th3 cells in lesions and spleen, and increased Th3 dependent IgG2b antibodies to oxLDL. A positive correlation was observed between plasma TGF-beta1 and cholesterol levels and between plasma TGF-beta1 and IgG2b anti-oxLDL.Such elevation of TGF-beta may increase the stability of plaques by inhibiting T cell responses and macrophage activation and by stimulating collagen synthesis. This new finding could be important in the regulation of immune activity, inflammation and fibrosis in the atherosclerotic plaque.",

The extent of disease was measured in the aortic root and was compared to that in animals treated with Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) pulsed DCs and to untreated animals. Mice receiving MDA-LDL pulsed DCs showed significantly larger atherosclerotic lesions compared to controls, with increased inflammation in the lesions and antigen-specific immune responses. Furthermore, MDA-LDL administration in complete Freund's adjuvant, which is atheroprotective, led to the induction of regulatory T cells whereas MDA-LDL-DCs treatment did not, suggesting that modulation of immune properties can result in different effects on atherosclerosis.DCs presenting components of LDL promote specific immunity to their antigen, increase lesion inflammation and accelerate atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease promoted by hypercholesterolemia. The role of adaptive immunity has been controversial, however. We hypothesized that proatherogenic T cells are controlled by immunoregulatory cytokines. Among them, TGF-beta has been implied in atherosclerosis, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. We crossed atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-knockout mice with transgenic mice carrying a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor II in T cells. The ApoE-knockout mice with disrupted TGF-beta signaling in T cells exhibited a sixfold increase in aortic lesion surface area, a threefold increase in aortic root lesion size, and a 125-fold increase in aortic IFN-gamma mRNA when compared with age-matched ApoE-knockout littermates. When comparing size-matched lesions, those of mice with T cell-specific blockade of TGF-beta signaling displayed increased T cells, activated macrophages, and reduced collagen, consistent with a more vulnerable phenotype. Ab's to oxidized LDL, circulating T cell cytokines, and spleen T cell activity were all increased in ApoE-knockout mice with dominant negative TGF-beta receptors in T cells. Taken together, these results show that abrogation of TGF-beta signaling in T cells increases atherosclerosis and suggest that TGF-beta reduces atherosclerosis by dampening T cell activation. Inhibition of T cell activation may therefore represent a strategy for antiatherosclerotic therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Several chemokines are important for monocyte/macrophage and T-cell recruitment to the lesion. CXCL16 is a recently discovered chemokine that is expressed in soluble and transmembrane forms, ligates CXCR6 chemokine receptor, and guides migration of activated Th1 and Tc1 cells. It is identical to scavenger receptor SR-PSOX, which mediates uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein. We investigated whether CXCL16 expression is controlled by interferon- (IFN-)-cytokine abundant in atherosclerotic lesions. Methods and Results\u2014CXCL16 and CXCR6 expression was identified by polymerase chain reaction and histochemistry in atherosclerotic lesions from humans and apolipoprotein-E- deficient mice. In vitro IFN- induced CXCL16 in human monocytic THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes, which led to increased uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in THP-1 cells, which could be blocked by peptide antibodies against CXCL16. In vivo IFN- induced CXCL16 expression in murine atherosclerotic lesions. Conclusions\u2014We demonstrate a novel role of IFN- in foam cell formation through upregulation of CXCL16/SR-PSOX. CXCR6 expression in the plaque confirms the presence of cells able to respond to CXCL16. Therefore, this chemokine/scavenger receptor could serve as a molecular link between lipid metabolism and immune activity in the atherosclerotic lesion.

Therefore, we conducted a study to provide new protocols for serum biochemical screening and developed the reference range for a set of 13 analytes that pertain to lipoprotein metabolism, electrolyte balance, and data reflecting function of the heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas. Male and female mice were studied, and blood samples were obtained at six and 20 weeks of age. Of 13 parameters studied, 12 were affected by age and sex. Briefly, male mice had higher triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and amylase values. With age, mice of both sexes developed higher triglycerides and glucose concentrations, as well as aspartate and alanine transaminase activities. A significant difference between mice and humans was noted for amylase activity, which is extremely high in this healthy mouse strain. Therefore, we suggest that caution should be taken when data are interpreted to indicate gastrointestinal disease in murine models. The reference values for murine clinical biochemical analytes obtained during the study reported here should be useful for characterizing the biochemical phenotype of experimental mice.",

Serine protease inhibitor A3 (serpinA3) is an inhibitor of several proteases such as elastase, cathepsin G and chymase derived from mast cells and neutrophils. In this study, we investigated the putative role of serpinA3 in atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation. SerpinA3 was expressed in endothelial cells and medial smooth muscle cells in human atherosclerotic lesions and a 14-fold increased expression of serpinA3n mRNA was found in lesions from Apoe-/- mice compared to lesion-free vessels. In contrast, decreased mRNA expression (-80%) of serpinA3 was found in biopsies of human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) compared to non-dilated aortas. Overexpression of serpinA3n in transgenic mice did not influence the development of atherosclerosis or CaCl2-induced aneurysm formation. In situ zymography analysis showed that the transgenic mice had lower cathepsin G and elastase activity, and more elastin in the aortas compared to wild-type mice, which could indicate a more stable aortic phenotype. Differential vascular expression of serpinA3 is clearly associated with human atherosclerosis and AAA but serpinA3 had no major effect on experimentally induced atherosclerosis or AAA development in mouse. However, serpinA3 may be involved in a phenotypic stabilization of the aorta.",

Immunization with both these antigen preparations reduced lesion development. The plaques contained immunogen(s) sharing epitopes on MDA-LDL, MDA-very low density lipoprotein, and oxidized cardiolipin. This shows that a T-cell-dependent antibody response was associated with protection against atherosclerosis.

Methods and Results\u2014To study the role of immunity in atherosclerosis, we crossed atherosclerosis-prone apoE \u2014/- mice with immunodeficient scid/scid mice. The offspring showed a 73% reduction in aortic fatty streak lesions when compared with immunocompetent apoE-/- mice. Transfer of CD41 T cells from apoE-/- to immunodeficient apoE-/-/scid/scid mice increased lesions by 164%. This was associated with the infiltration of transferred T cells into lesions, increased circulating interferon- g levels, and increased I-A expression in lesions.

        "abstract": "In the course of atherosclerosis, humans and apolipoprotein (apoE) Knockout (KO) mice exhibit an active cell-mediated and humoral immune process, both at the systemic level and within atheromata. Low density lipoproteins (LDL) infiltrate the vascular wall, where they are oxidatively modified. This oxidative modification may generate new epitopes for which tolerance is not achieved during ontogenesis. Such epitopes could constitute new targets for autoreactive immune responses that may have a physiopathological role in disease development.Exposing mice to high dose of antigens during thymic T-cell education induces immunological tolerance to the administered antigens. We injected newborn apoE KO mice with oxidized LDL. They were fed a cholesterol-rich diet and aortic atherosclerosis, cell-mediated immune response, and T-cell repertoire were analyzed after 5 months.Injection of oxidized LDL at birth reduced not only the immune response to oxidized LDL, but also susceptibility to atherosclerosis in apoE mice. Injection of oxidized LDL induced T-cell tolerance due to clonal deletion, rather than anergy of the reactive T cells. The T-cell repertoire of apoE KO mice was affected by the development of the disease, whereas tolerization normalized it.This study demonstrates that the immune response against oxidized LDL has a deleterious role in atherogenesis and that a fine-tuning of this response could modify the course of the disease.",

The presence of activated macrophages and T cells in lesions suggests that cell-mediated immune reactions are taking place during the disease process. However, the role of specific immune responses has remained unclear. We have previously shown that transfer of CD4+ T cells from apolipoprotein E knockout mice (apoE(-/-)) into immunodeficient apoE(-/-) scid/scid mice accelerates disease.To test whether this effect is dependent on specific disease-associated antigens, purified CD4+ T cells from oxLDL-immunized mice were transferred into apoE(-/-) scid/scid mice. CD4+ T cells from mice immunized with a nonrelevant antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and na\u00efve CD4+ T cells were used as controls. After 12 weeks, all mice that received T cells had larger lesions than untouched apoE(-/-) scid/scid controls. However, mice receiving CD4+ T cells from oxLDL immunized mice had substantially accelerated lesion progression compared with those receiving naive or KLH-primed T cells. Circulating levels of interferon-gamma were increased in proportion to the acceleration of atherosclerosis.These data show that adoptive transfer of purified CD4+ T cells from oxLDL-immunized mice accelerates atherosclerosis. They support the notion that Th1 cellular immunity is proatherogenic and identify oxLDL as a culprit autoantigen.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a complex disease, bearing many of the characteristics of a chronic inflammatory process. Both cellular and humoral immune responses may be involved in the disease development. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is suggested to be an autoantigen in atherosclerosis. A protective effect against atherosclerosis has been demonstrated in animals immunized with oxLDL. Such a protection is associated with elevation of T cell-dependent IgG antibodies against oxLDL. In addition, it has been shown that immunization with Freund adjuvant alone also confers protection against development of atherosclerosis. We therefore hypothesized that CD4+ T cells are critical in the development of atherosclerosis and that they are involved in protective immune reactions after immunization. The development of atherosclerosis was studied in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE KO) mice and CD4/apoE double knockout (dKO) mice that were immunized with either oxLDL in Freund adjuvant or adjuvant alone, or left untreated. Our results show that (1) the absence of CD4+ cells in apoE KO mice leads to reduced atherosclerosis, indicating that CD4+ cells constitute a major proatherogenic cell population, and (2) the atheroprotective effect of LDL immunization does not depend on CD4+ cells, whereas (3) the atheroprotective effect of adjuvant injection is CD4-dependent. These findings demonstrate complex roles of immune cell-cell interactions in the regulation of the atherosclerotic process and point to several possible targets in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.",

The rats were then kept in darkness for recovery and killed at scheduled time points from 0 hours up to 24 hours after exposure to light. The unexposed rats were used as the control. Apoptosis was marked with in situ terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Caspase-3 expression was explored using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, real-time RT-PCR, and enzyme activity assay.Exposure to blue light resulted in photoreceptor cell apoptosis, mostly in the superior temporal area of the retina. TUNEL-positive cells were highest during 8 to 16 hours of recovery in darkness. Procaspase-3 protein was constitutively expressed in the rat retina and was apparently upregulated after exposure to light, with expression peaking at 8 to 16 hours and subsiding at 24 hours. The upregulation was further supported by enhanced transcription of caspase-3 in the postexposure retina. Meanwhile, increased cleavage of caspase-3 into its active fragments of 17 and 19 kDa was detected after exposure to light, peaking at 16 hours. Activation of caspase-3 was subsequently located in the photoreceptor cells and predominantly in the superior part of the temporal quadrant. This coincided with elevated caspase-3-like activity at 16 hours after exposure to light.Procaspase-3 protein is temporally upregulated in the retina after in vivo exposure to blue light, and the upregulation is coupled to activation of caspase-3 and concomitant induction of apoptosis in the photoreceptor cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background  The most efficient approach to diagnose malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) is still controversial and uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of a combined approach using ultrasound (US)-guided cutting-needle biopsy (CNB) and standard pleural biopsy (SPB) for diagnosing MPE.   Methods  Pleural effusions were collected from 172 patients for biochemical and microbiological analyses. US-guided CNB and SPB were performed in the same operation sequentially to obtain specimens for histological analysis.   Results  US-guided CNB and SPB procedures provided adequate material for histological analysis in 90.7 and 93.0% of cases, respectively, while a combination of the 2 techniques was in 96.5% of cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV), negative-predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy of US-guided CNB versus SPB were: 51.2 vs 63.4%, 100 vs 100%, 100 vs 100%, 64.9 vs 72.2% and 74.4 vs 81.3%, respectively. When CNB was combined with SPB, the corresponding values were 88.6, 100, 100, 88.6 and 93.9%, respectively. Whereas sensitivity, NPV and diagnostic accuracy were not significantly different between CNB and SPB, the combination of CNB and SPB significantly improved the sensitivity, NPV and diagnostic accuracy versus each technique alone ( p  Conclusions  Use of a combination of US-guided CNB and SPB afforded a high sensitivity to diagnose MPEs, it is a convenient and safe approach.",

        "abstract": "Objective\u2014The proatherogenic effect of IL-18 is shown to be dependent on IFN- production. It is believed that activated T cells play a proatherogenic role through secretion of IFN-. However, recent studies in vitro have shown that macrophages, NK cells, and even vascular smooth muscle cells may also secrete IFN- after stimulation by cytokines like IL-18. We therefore investigated whether cells other than activated T cells can play a proatherogenic role via IFN- secretion under the stimulation of IL-18 in vivo. Methods and Results\u2014SCID/apoE knockout mice were injected intraperitoneally with either IL-18 or phosphate-buffered saline 3 times per week for 7 weeks. Our results show that administration of IL-18 leads to 3-fold larger lesions and 2-fold higher circulating IFN- despite the absence of T cells. In addition, increased IFN-, accompanied by elevation of the scavenger receptor/chemokine CXCL16, was observed in both lesions and spleens. Furthermore, our findings revealed that macrophages, NK cells, and vascular cells were the source of IFN- under the stimulation of IL-18 in the absence of T cells in vivo. Conclusion\u2014The current data suggest that the proatherogenic effect of IL-18 can occur in the absence of T cells and that IFN- secreted by macrophages, NK cells, and vascular cells is sufficient for the disease progression.

        "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is synthesized by a variety of cells including macrophages. These cells activate T lymphocytes by antigen presentation, while the T-cell cytokine, interferon-gamma, inhibits macrophage ApoE expression. ApoE inhibits T-cell proliferation in culture but its role in immune responses has been unclear. The ApoE-deficient (E0) mouse permits an evaluation of the immunological role of ApoE. We have analysed T-cell responses to an exogenous antigen (ovalbumin) and polyclonal mitogen (concanavalin A) in E0 and ApoE+/+ mice. Macrophages of E0 mice stimulated T-cell activation more effectively as antigen-presenting cells than macrophages from ApoE+/+ mice. Both proliferation and interferon-gamma secretion were enhanced in T cells activated in the context of antigen-presenting cells from E0 mice. Since the macrophage-T-cell interaction depends on interactions between cell surface molecules, we assessed the expression of such molecules after in vivo stimulation with interferon-gamma. This treatment caused an increased expression of the co-stimulatory surface proteins CD40 and CD80, and also of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules I-Ab on macrophages of E0 mice compared with ApoE+/+. Our data suggest that ApoE inhibits T-cell activation by reducing the density of immune stimulatory proteins on antigen-presenting cells.",
