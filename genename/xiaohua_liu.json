Results The CyPA levels were signifcantly higer in the active SLE subjects than those in the inactive SLE or normal controls (P<0.05).The IFN-\u03b3 level in culture supernatant secreted by Jurkat cell lines was increased only after stimulated by rhCyPA plus PHA at same time. Conclusion rhCyPA and PHA can synergistically induce Jurkat cell lines secreting IFN-\u03b3.Abnormal increase of CyPA in peripheral blood of SLE patients may participate in stimulating T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 and activating SLE,which may be taken as an useful clinical index for evaluating SLE activity.",

        "abstract": "This study provided a comprehensive component analysis and structure identification of active substances for the anti-gastric ulcer effects of Radix Astragali. The data were generated by organically combining the results from in vivo pharmacodynamic experiments, a cell growth-promoting assay, structure identification, content determination, fingerprinting, and correlation analyses. The fingerprints from high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and from HPLC coupled with evaporative light scattering detectors (ELSD) from 95% ethanol extracts of Radix Astragali (ERA) were determined using HPLC-DAD-ELSD. The structures of 16 compounds were identified using ultra-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). The contents of these 16 compounds were simultaneously determined in a single run using HPLC-DAD-ELSD. The strength of the anti-ulceration effect of each of the 16 compounds was correlated to its content in the HPLC spectrum using gray relation statistics. The sequence of the contribution from each of the 16 compounds to the anti-gastric ulcer effect was determined. The results showed that ononin, astragalosideIII, and astragalosideIV contributed most to the observed anti-gastric ulcer effects and that these three compounds also exhibited strong growth-promoting effects in cultured GES-1 cells. The results of this study can be used to evaluate the quality of Radix Astragali and to provide a theoretical foundation for its further study.",

        "abstract": "Radix Astragali (Huangqi in Chinese) and Fructus Ligustri Lucidi (Nvzhenzi in Chinese) (2:1, w/w) are combined in an herbal formulation called Zhenqi Fuzheng capsules (ZFCs) for use in China to improve immunity, promote the recovery of normal functions after surgical operations, and as the most important adjuvant therapy in cancer. In this study, the tissue distribution profiles of the six major bio-active constituents (calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, ononin, calycosin, formononetin, astragaloside IV and astragaloside II) were examined after oral administration of ZFCs to rats. All six constituents in each tissue were detected simultaneously using UPLC-ESI-MS, and the concentration of each constituent per gram of each tissue was determined. Quantification was performed using low-energy collision tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan mode for the following precursor ion\u2192product ion transitions at m/z 447.21\u2192285.30 for calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, m/z 285.29\u2192270.38 for calycosin, m/z 431\u2192269 for ononin, m/z 269\u2192237 for formononetin, m/z 807.40\u2192627.50 for astragaloside IV, m/z 849.60\u2192669.65 for astragaloside II and m/z 633.18\u2192331.18 for the internal standard (hesperidin). The results showed that in general the tissue concentrations for all six constituents were in the following order: spleen>stomach>thymus>lung>liver>kidney>heart>testicle. The high levels in the spleen and thymus indicated that all six compounds accumulated in organs involved in the immune response, consistent with the immunity effects of ZFC. The high levels in the stomach were consistent with the oral administration of ZFC. This study was the first to compare the tissue distribution of calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside with that of calycosin or of ononin with that of formononetin in rats. It was also the first study to examine the tissue distribution of astragaloside II, calycosin and formononetin following oral administration of ZFC to rats.",

Phenol red expectorant experiment was used to observe the phlegm-reducing effect in mice. Mice were administered intragastrically with chloroform extract fractions for 6 days (1.4 g x kg(-1)), with acute bronchitis syrup as the positive control drug (12 mL x kg(-1)). The phenol red secretion in mice was determined by spectrophotometer. Then the grey relational analysis was used to study the spectrum-effect relationship.The phlegm-reducing effect of the chloroform extract fractions of PHS were resulted from the combined effect of all of its chemical components. Its various characteristic peaks represented different chemical components, and the order of their contributions to the phlegm-reducing effect was (number of peaks) 13 > 12 > 16 > 18 > 19 > 6 > 20 > 14 > 1 > 11 > 15 > 10 > 17 > 2 > 5 > 4 > 7 > 3 > 8 > 9, in No. 1, 3, 4, 10, 13 and 16 characteristic peaks were identified as marmesin, psoralen, xanthotoxin, Pd-Ib, pteryxin and peuformosin.The chloroform extract fractions of PHS show strongly phlegm-reducing effect.

Methods: A fraction of water-soluble neutral polysaccharide was obtained from H. polybotrys by aqueous extraction followed by precipitation with ethanol. The homogeneous polysaccharide named HPS4-1A was obtained after treated with Savage method and H2O2, and purified with Sephadex G-200 gel filtration chromatography. Then GC, HPGC, GPC-MALLS, element alanalyser, phenol sulfuric acid method, and Bradford method were used to study the physicochemical property of HPS4-1A; The conformation was primarily analyzed with GPC-MALLS method. The connection, main chain and branched-chain structures, and the condition of branching point were studied by methylation, partial acid hydrolysis, and NMR method. Results: The absolute and relative molecular weights of HPS4-1A were 7.386 \u00d7 104 and above 6.68 \u00d7 105; HPS4-1A was a heteropolysaccharide and consisted of L-rhamnose, L-arabinose, D-glucose, and D-galactose (1:2:1:2). HPS4-1A proved to be a neutral sugar, with 1, 6- and 1,2, 6-\u03b1-D-galactopyranosyl and 1, 5- and 1, 3, 5-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranosyl residues in backbone, and 1, 4- and 1, 4, 6-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl and 1, 2- and 1,2, 4-\u03b1-L-rhamnofuranosyl residues in branches. Arabinose mainly connected the end of backbone, and glucose and a small quantity of arabinose mainly connected the end of branches. Conclusion: HPS4-1A is a new neutral heteropolysaccharide from H. polybotrys. HPS4-1A has a random coil state conformation with monodisperse mass distribution.",

It was composed of rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactose in the molar ratio of 10.09%:25.90%:25.90%:25.0%:12.30%. Elemental analysis indicated that HPS4-2A was a sulfated polysaccharide containing small amount of sulfate groups (1.87%). Partial acid hydrolysis, GC, GC-MS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy analysis of the HPS4-2A revealed a predominance of glucose, galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose linked in a highly-branched structure. The molecular weight of HPS4-2A was determined by HPSEC and HPSEC-MALLS. AFM study indicated that HPS4-2A took a highly branched conformation, which in consistent with the result studied by SEC-MALLS. Structural features of HPS4-2A were also investigated by SEM and TEM. Antioxidant assays demonstrated that HPS4-2A possessed of strong DPPH and hydroxyl radicals scavenging activities, suggesting that HPS4-2A could potentially be used as natural antioxidant.",

Plasma samples were extracted with Waters Oasis(TM) HLB 1 cc (30 mg) Extraction Cartridges (SPE) separated on an UPLC\u2122 BEH C18 column and detected by MS with electro spray ionization interface in positive selective ion monitoring mode. Calibration curves offered linear ranges of two orders of magnitude with r (2) > 0.99. The method had the lower limit quantification of 1.30, 0.73, 1.17, 2.33, 0.63, and 0.83 ng/mL for ononin, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, formononetin, astragaloside IV, and astragaloside II, respectively, with precision less than 10 %. The RSD of intra- and inter-day variations ranged from 1.66 to 6.46 and 3.39 to 6.58 %. This developed method was applied subsequently to pharmacokinetic studies of the six compounds in rats successfully. The proposed method was for the first time to compare the pharmacokinetic difference between calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside and calycosin in rat plasma, so as between ononin and formononetin, and studied to the astragaloside II pharmacokinetics in rat plasma.",

It is observed that one enantiomer of N -Boc-proline can increase the fluorescence intensity of the binaphthyl fluorophores by over 57-fold, while the other enantiomer can cause only sixfold fluorescence enhancement. Such unusually highly enantioselective response demonstrates that this sensor is potentially useful in the enantioselective recognition of amino acid derivatives.

        "abstract": "A highly effective aldol cyclization of \u03b1-isothiocyanato imide to both \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-keto esters and aryl-substituted \u03b1-keto esters has been developed. A chiral N,N\u2032-dioxide-yttrium triflate complex was used as the catalyst. A series of cyclic thiocarbamates bearing chiral quaternary stereocenters was synthesized in good to high yields, excellent diastereo- (up to 25:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee). In addition, the reaction could be carried out on a gram-scale, and other functionalized derivatives are also conveniently transformed. Interestingly, a discrepancy of diastereoselection was observed between the reactions of \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-keto esters and aryl-substituted \u03b1-keto esters. Moreover, a substrate dependency of non-linear effects was observed in this reaction. On the basis of the experimental results and the absolute configuration of the products, possible catalytic models have been proposed to explain the origin of the asymmetric process.

They retained their initial activity for more than one month if used once a day. The calibration curve was linear for Cu2+ from 0.6 to 158.8 \u03bcg L -1 with a detection limit of 0.38 \u03bcg L-1.

        "title": "Enantioselective cyanosilylation of aldehydes catalyzed by a novel N,N\u2032-dioxide-Ti(OiPr)4 bifunctional catalyst",
        "abstract": "A novel bifunctional asymmetric catalyst containing N -oxide and titanium(IV) was developed and applied to the asymmetric cyanosilylation of aldehydes. Optically active trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin ethers were obtained up to 99% yield and 80% ee in the presence of 5 mol % catalyst loading at \u221278 \u00b0C. Based on the experimental results, the catalytic cycle was proposed as a pathway in which Lewis acid and Lewis base activated aldehyde and trimethylsilylcyanide (TMSCN), respectively. Graphical abstract Keywords Asymmetric catalysis Cyanosilylation Lewis acid Lewis base Bifunctional catalyst 1 Introduction Optically active cyanohydrins are useful intermediates toward a wide variety of chiral compounds, such as \u03b1-amino acids, 1 \u03b1-hydroxy carboxylic acids, 2 \u03b2-amino alcohols, 3 \u03b1-hydroxy aldehydes, 3 \u03b1-hydroxy ketones, 3 etc. In view of their importance, asymmetric cyanosilylation of aldehydes has been studied intensively by employing chiral metal complexes and organocatalysts. 4 Titanium-based complexes have attracted the most interest, and the chiral ligands include sulfoximines, 5 phosphineoxide, 4g BINOLs, 4b,c,6 TADDOL, 7 and others. 8 Shibasaki and co-workers reported asymmetric cyanosilylation of aldehydes by a Lewis acid\u2013Lewis base bifunctional catalyst prepared from a BINOL derivative ( Fig.\u00a01 ). 6e,f The concept of the double-activation method has been applied to perform asymmetric cyanosilylation of ketones. 9 As the subsequence of our previous work, a new bifunctional catalyst was designed ( Fig.\u00a02 ) and we expected that the catalyst containing Lewis acid and Lewis base could activate aldehydes and TMSCN, respectively. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Optimization of the catalysts Based on the properties of bifunctional catalyst shown in Figure\u00a02 , several chiral ligands were synthesized ( Fig.\u00a03 ). The asymmetric addition of TMSCN to benzaldehyde was\u00a0investigated in the presence of 5 mol % 1 -Ti(O i Pr) 4 complexes in CH 2 Cl 2 at \u221278 \u00b0C ( Table 1 , entries 1\u201312). The data listed in Table 1 showed that 1d -Ti(O i Pr) 4 gave the product with higher ee value (66% ee, Table 1 , entry 4) than other amide N -oxide complexes derived from aromatic amines ( Table 1 , entries 1\u20133). Replacement of the cyclohexyl in the amide position with sterically more demanding adamantanyl decreased the enantiomeric excess from 55 to 50% ( Table 1 , entry 6 vs 5). Compound 1h afforded the product with the highest ee value ( Table 1 , entry 8) among 1g \u2013 i ( Table 1 , entries 7\u20139). Compound 1h not only gave good enantioselectivity but also afforded the product in good yield. The poor results were obtained with mono N -oxide 2a and 2b ( Table 1 , entries 10 and 11), and no product was\u00a0detected using 2c without N -oxide ( Table 1 , entry 12). So it could be shown that complex 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 was the effective catalyst. Inspired by our previous work, 11 several additives were examined in order to increase the yield ( Table 2 ). The result revealed that 4- tert -butylphenol played a negative role in the enantioselectivity and reactivity ( Table 2 , entry 1). Excitingly, the reaction was found to improve significantly when organic amines or organic acids were used except 2-hydroxybenzoic acid and toluenesulfonic acid ( Table 2 , entries 2\u201314). By increasing the loading of 4-methylbenzoic acid from 10 to 20 mol %, the enantioselectivity could be improved up to 80% ee ( Table 2 , entry 15 vs 8). Further increasing amounts of additive did not increase ee value ( Table 2 , entry 16). Then, other reaction parameters were investigated using 4-methylbenzoic acid as an additive. Subsequently, the reaction conditions were optimized in the\u00a0presence of 20 mol % additive. When Ti(O i Pr) 4 was replaced by other metal reagents, such as Al(O i Pr) 3 , Et 3 Al, and Zr(O i Pr) 4 , inferior results were obtained ( Table 3 , entries 1\u20133). Solvent screening revealed that CH 2 Cl 2 was the best. Ether solvent (THF or Et 2 O) gave moderate enantioselectivities ( Table 3 , entries 5 and 6), and toluene gave only 55% ee ( Table 3 , entry 7). The data in Table 4 indicated that low temperature was an essential factor to obtain high enantioselectivity. Increasing the temperature led to decrease in enantioselectivity ( Table 4 , entries 1\u20133). Increasing or decreasing the concentration of benzaldehyde from 0.2 M caused a slight decrease in enantiomeric excess ( Table 4 , entries 4\u20136). When the concentration of benzaldehyde was 0.1 M, the yield decreased sharply only to 41% ( Table 4 , entry 6). Changing the ratio of 1h to Ti(O i Pr) 4 from 2:1 to 1:1 resulted in a drop in the enantiomeric excess of the product ( Table 4 , entry 7 vs 1). Unfortunately, more loading (10 mol %) of chiral titanium complex caused a slight decrease in enantioselectivity (75% ee, Table 4 , entry 8). Therefore the optimal reaction conditions were 5 mol % catalyst loading in the presence of 20 mol % of 4-methylbenzoic acid, and the concentration of aldehyde was 0.2 M in CH 2 Cl 2 at \u221278 \u00b0C. 2.2 Scope of the substrates Encouraged by the result of benzaldehyde, a range of aldehydes such as aromatic, aliphatic, heteroaromatic, and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes were investigated under the optimal conditions. The results are summarized in Table 5 . In general, excellent yields and good enantiomeric excesses could be obtained with aromatic aldehydes. Methyl substituted aromatic aldehydes were found to be good substrates for this reaction ( Table 5 , entries 2 and 3), giving enantioselectivities of trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin ethers similar to those obtained with benzaldehyde ( Table 5 , entry 1), while the halogen substituted aromatic aldehydes led to slight decrease in enantioselectivity compared with benzaldehyde ( Table 5 , entries 4\u20137). 4-Methoxybenzaldehyde afforded the product with 70% ee and 91% yield ( Table 5 , entry 8). The result of 1-naphthaldehyde suggested that substrate with sterically bulky group had negative effect on enantioselectivity ( Table 5 , entry 9). Aliphatic aldehydes gave the corresponding trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin ethers with moderate enantiomeric excess ( Table 5 , entries 10 and 11). Heteroaromatic and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes also afforded similar results to aliphatic aldehydes ( Table 5 , entries 12 and 13). All the data showed that a wide range of aldehydes reacted smoothly with TMSCN to afford the corresponding products with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. 2.3 Preliminary mechanistic studies Structure of 11 was proposed as shown in Figure\u00a04 , which contained a nine-membered ring. It was less stable compared to six-membered ring structure 12 ( Fig.\u00a05 ). Based on the results of the experiments and our early work, 9d,e,12 we thought that the pyrrolidine N -oxide and the nitrogen atom of amide might coordinate to titanium to activate the aldehyde, and the N -oxide of the pyridine acted as a Lewis base to activate TMSCN ( Fig.\u00a06 , shown in intermediate 13 ). Large steric hindrance between R group of the aldehyde and two phenyl groups of the amide might direct the CN to attack the aldehyde giving R configuration product. A proposed catalytic cycle ( Fig.\u00a06 ) and a possible transition state were illustrated based on the reactivity of the substrates and the configuration of the products. 3 Conclusion In conclusion, a novel bifunctional asymmetric catalyst was developed for the asymmetric cyanosilylation of aldehydes. A variety of aldehydes including aromatic, heteroaromatic, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated, and aliphatic aldehydes reacted smoothly with TMSCN in the presence of 4-methylbenzoic acid to afford the corresponding trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin ethers in excellent yields with good enantiomeric excesses (up to 80% ee). Based on the experimental results, the catalytic cycle was proposed. Further efforts will be focused on the understanding of the reaction mechanism and search for more effective catalysts. 4 Experimental 4.1 General methods All reactions were carried out using anhydrous solvents and under nitrogen in oven-dried tubes unless noted otherwise. Toluene, THF, and Et 2 O were dried and distilled from sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen prior to use. CH 2 Cl 2 was dried over powdered CaH 2 and distilled under nitrogen prior to use. Ti(O i Pr) 4 (from Acros) was distilled and diluted to 1 M in toluene, stored under nitrogen. HG/T2354-92 silica gel was used for flash chromatography (FC). Melting points (mp) were measured on electrothermal digital melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. Enantiomeric excesses (ee) were determined by HPLC using corresponding commercial chiral column as stated in the experimental procedures at 23 \u00b0C with UV detection at 254 nm or chiral GC with\u00a0a Varian GC system: column Chirasil DEX CB. Optical rotations were measured on the Autopol V Automatic Polarimeter. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 on Inova-400 (400 MHz) or Bruker Avance 600 (600 MHz) and were reported in parts per million using TMS ( \u03b4 =0) or residual CDCl 3 ( \u03b4 =7.26) as the reference. 13 C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl 3 on Inova-400 (100 MHz) or Bruker Avance 600 (150 MHz) and were reported in parts per million relative to the central CDCl 3 resonance ( \u03b4 =77.00). 4.2 Materials It was noteworthy that oxidation was carried out at \u221278 \u00b0C with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid ( m -CPBA) ( Scheme 1 ). 13 4.2.1 Typical procedure for the amino acid amide derivatives 10 4.2.1.1 (2 S ,3a S ,6a S )- N -Aryl/alkyl-1-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-octahydrocyclopenta[ b ]pyrrole-2-carboxamide 10 Anhydrous K 2 CO 3 (276 mg, 2 mmol) was added at room temperature to a solution of (2 S ,3a S ,6a S )- N -aryl/alkyl-octahydrocyclopenta[ b ]pyrrole-2-carboxamide 9 (2 mmol) in CH 3 CN (10 mL). Then 2-(chloromethyl)pyridine hydrochloride (410 mg, 2.5 mmol) was added to the mixture. The resulting mixture was refluxed for 5 h, and the reaction was monitored by TLC. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and filtered to give a red solution.

After 0.5 h the solution was cooled to \u221278 \u00b0C and TMSCN (40 \u03bcL, 0.3 mmol) [caution!] was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for the indicated time in Table 5 at \u221278 \u00b0C. Purification of the trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin ether was performed by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate=10:1, v/v) to give the product as colorless oil. To the product was added a mixture of 1 M HCl (5 mL) and CH 3 OH (10 mL) and stirred for 4 h at room temperature. Then it was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3\u00d710 mL) and the organic layer was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 . The cyanohydrin was converted into the corresponding acetate by reaction with Ac 2 O (100 \u03bcL) and pyridine (50 \u03bcL) in CH 2 Cl 2 (5 mL) at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with 5 mL water. The organic layer was separated, washed with H 2 O, dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , and concentrated. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (petroleum/EtOAc=10:1, v/v) to yield the corresponding acetylated cyanohydrin for further analysis. 4.2.2.1 ( R )-(+)-2-Hydroxy-2-phenylacetonitrile ( 5a ) [\u03b1] D 20 +5.0 ( c 0.11, CHCl 3 ) (80% ee) [lit. 10a [\u03b1] D 20 \u22127.24 ( c 0.23, CHCl 3 ) for S enantiomer in 99% ee]. 1 H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 =7.60\u20137.40 (m, 5H), 5.55 (s, 1H), 2.91 (s, 1H).

        "abstract": "Although isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions were proven to be simple, elegant and facile strategies for the synthesis of highly valuable nitrogen-containing heterocycles, their asymmetric versions accessing to optically active nitrogen heterocyclic compounds are rather limited. Here, we illustrate that, relying on the enantioselective addition of simple isocyanides to C=C bonds, several isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions are realized in the presence of a chiral Mg-N,N'-dioxide catalyst. In the reaction among isocyanide, TMSN, and alkylidene malonate, three- or four-component reactions could be precisely controlled by modulating reaction conditions, supplying two types of enantioenriched tetrazole-derivatives in moderate to high yields. Possible catalytic cycles via a key zwitterionic intermediate, and the vital roles of HO or excess ligand are provided based on control experiments. Moreover, taking advantage of this zwitterionic intermediate as a 1,3-dipole, an enantioselective dearomative [3+2] annulation reaction of nonactivated isoquinolines is achieved, furnishing chiral 1,2-dihydroisoquinolines in good to excellent results.",

Even with 1 mol% catalyst loading or on scaleup (10 mmol of starting material), maintenance of ee was observed, which showed the potential value of the catalyst system.

The product 3a was facilely converted into several interesting compounds, such as tryptamines, indolepropionic acids and \u03b2-carbolines. It is noteworthy that the seven-membered \u03b2-carboline-like compound has been synthesized for the first time. Based on the crystal structure of the chiral N,N\u2032-dioxide L10-scandium(III) complex, the proposed transition state and possible catalytic cycle were presented to elucidate the reaction mechanism. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The corresponding alpha-amino nitriles were obtained in high yields with up to 95 % ee (ee=enantiomeric excess) under mild conditions. Optically pure products could be obtained after a single recrystallization. The catalyst can be easily prepared from trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline and a diamine in three steps.

        "abstract": "A study was conducted for catalytic asymmetric direct allylation of aldimines accelerated by C2-symmetric N,N'-dioxide-ScIII complexes under mild conditions. The study observed that chiral N,N'-dioxidemetal complexes in catalytic asymmetric reactions showed good activation of allylstannane reagent and 2-aminophenol-derived aldimines. It was also observed that the modular and tuneable N,N'-dioxide ligands can be synthesized from readily accessible chiral amino acids and amines, that lead to the catalyst structure optimization. The chiral backbone and steric effects of the amide portion of ligands made a significant impact on the enantioselectivity for this reaction. It was also observed during study that homoallylic amines obtained with high enantioselectivities and good yields under mild conditions.",

Commonly, both enantiomers of a chiral catalyst are used to synthesize two enantiomers of a chiral compound, however, it is quite difficult to obtain the catalysts with opposite configurations in most cases. Thus, chemists pay much attention to look for new strategies. Enantiodivergent synthesis demonstrates cost effectiveness and practicability to solve this issue by tuning the reaction parameters with the use of ligands derived from a single chiral source. In 2003 and 2008, two reviews have commendably summarized the enantiodivergent reactions, and some representative examples were illustrated. In this review, reversal of enantioselectivity in metal complex-mediated asymmetric catalysis from 2008 to present was updated. Several factors of delivering enantiodivergence are introduced, including metal salts, ligands, additives, solvents, temperature and so on.",

Both aliphatic and aromatic ketimines, especially sterically bulky cyclic ketimines derived from beta-acetonaphthone, alpha-indanone, and alpha-tetralone were found suitable for this reaction. On the basis of the experimental results and previous reports, trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) was indicated to be the real reactive nucleophile despite the existence of PBAP, and a possible working model was proposed to explain the origin of the asymmetric induction. The facile availability of 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diylphosphoric acid (BNPH) and the simplicity of the procedure are beneficial for practical applications.",

The experiment included use of L-Ramipril acid derived N,N'-dioxide L1-nickle(II) complex to catalyze the asymmetric Michael addition of diethyl malonate to chalcone in EtOH at 35\u00b0C. The results show that 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves when added as additives result in an improved reactivity and a 95% yield without loss of enantioselectivity. Diisopropyl malonate is found to be an excellent Michael donor than the reaction accomplished in 15hr in 98% yield with 99% ee. The results also show that the electronic nature or the position of the substituents at the aromatic rings of R2 or 3 has little influence on the enantioselectivity.",

The calibration\n curve was linear for Cu2+ from 0.6 to 158.8 \u03bcg L\u22121 with a detection limit of 0.38 \u03bcg L\u22121. The relative standard deviation was 3.2% for a series of six successive measurements. The proposed method was applied in\n the determination of Cu2+ in mineral water and human hair samples.",

Even with 1 mol % catalyst loading or on scaleup (10 mmol of starting material), maintenance of ee was observed, which showed the potential value of the catalyst system. In studies probing the reaction mechanism, a positive nonlinear effect was observed and Sc(III)-based enolate intermediates were detected by using ESIMS.

        "abstract": "The crossed-conjugate addition involving the electronwithdrawing group (EWG) of activated alkenes is considered one of the most important C-C bond-forming reactions in organic synthesis. Among them, the \u03b2,\u03b2-disubstituted nitroolefins as powerful synthons have attracted considerable attention recently because the functionalized products can undergo transformations into useful skeletons. Asymmetric intermolecular crossed-conjugate addition between \u03b2-alkyl nitroalkenes and a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to provide allylic nitro compounds with multiple stereogenic centers is still rare. The key challenges are to avoid the homo-crossed addition and realize perfect stereochemical control. Shi and co-workers developed the first asymmetric crossed-conjugate addition of \u03b2-alkyl nitroalkenes and enals catalyzed by a chiral diphenylprolinol though a dual activation strategy using a stoichiometric amount of (MeO)3P as a Lewis base (LB) (Scheme 1, path A). Although the secondary amines proved to be effective catalysts in the crossed-Michael addition of nitro activated olefins to carbonyl compounds through the LB nucleophilic mechanism, the enantioselective process awaits further investigation.We envisioned that a chiral diamine catalyst would promote the enantioselective crossed-conjugate addition by a bifunctional activation approach (Scheme 1, path B). Herein, we report the chiral primary-secondary diamine Bronsted acid catalyzed asymmetric crossed-conjugate addition of \u03b2-methyl nitroalkenes with \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated acyclic and cyclic ketones with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions. \u00a9 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

        "abstract": "Full investigation of cyanation of aldehydes, ketones, aldimines and ketimines with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) or ethyl cyanoformate (CNCOOEt) as the cyanide source has been accomplished by employing an in situ generated catalyst from cinchona alkaloid, tetraisopropyl titanate [Ti(OiPr)(4)] and an achiral modified biphenol. With TMSCN as the cyanide source, good to excellent results have been achieved for the Strecker reaction of N-Ts (Ts=p-toluenesulfonyl) aldimines and ketimines (up to >99% yield and >99% ee) as well as for the cyanation of ketones (up to 99% yield and 98% ee). By using CNCOOEt as the alternative cyanide source, cyanation of aldehyde was accomplished and various enantioenriched cyanohydrin carbonates were prepared in up to 99% yield and 96% ee. Noteworthy, CNCOOEt was successfully employed for the first time in the asymmetric Strecker reaction of aldimines and ketimines, affording various alpha-amino nitriles with excellent yields and ee values (up to >99% yield and >99% ee). The merits of current protocol involved facile availability of ligand components, operational simplicity and mild reaction conditions, which made it convenient to prepare synthetically important chiral cyanohydrins and alpha-amino nitriles. Furthermore, control experiments and NMR analyses were performed to shed light on the catalyst structure. It is indicated that all the hydroxyl groups in cinchona alkaloid and biphenol complex with Ti(IV), forming the catalyst with the structure of (biphenoxide)Ti(OR*)(OiPr). The absolute configuration adopted by biphenol 4 m in the catalyst was identified as S configuration according to the evidence from control experiments and NMR analyses. Moreover, the roles of the protonic additive (iPrOH) and the tertiary amine in the cinchona alkaloid were studied in detail, and the real cyanide reagent in the catalytic cycle was found to be hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Finally, two plausible catalytic cycles were proposed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms.",

        "title": "Catalytic cyanosilylation of ketones using organic catalyst 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine",
        "abstract": "Abstract 1,1,3,3-Tetramethylguanidine acts as a highly effective catalyst for cyanosilylation of various ketones and aldehydes to the corresponding cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ethers in up to 99% yield. The reaction proceeds smoothly with 0.1 mol % catalyst loading at 25 \u00b0C under solvent-free conditions. Guanidines can be classified as organic bases, like amines and amidines, which are regarded as the strongest organic bases 1 due to the resonance stability of their conjugated acids. 2 As a strong organic base catalyst, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (TMG) has been used for C\u2013C bond formation, 3\u20135 for instance Michael addition 4 and aldol condensation. 5 Some applications of modified guanidines to asymmetric synthesis as chiral bases can also be found in the literature. 6\u201310 Cyanosilylation of ketones is one of the most powerful procedure for the synthesis of cyanohydrins, which can be readily converted to various important building blocks. 11 Many catalysts have been used to promote the cyanosilylation. 12 For example, acidic catalysts, 13 inorganic solid bases, 14 solubilized anionic species, 15 neutral metal compounds, 16 as well as diamino functionalized polymers, 17 and inorganic/organic salts. 18 Recently, many chiral catalysts have been successfully applied to this reaction. 19,20 Amine has been employed for the cyanosilylation of aldehyde, 21 however it did not work well for ketones. We consider that guanidines with stronger basicity may both activate TMSCN and catalyze the cyanosilylation of ketones. Initially, several organic bases were examined with acetophenone as a model substrate ( Scheme 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , the effect of catalysts was related to the basicity of these organic bases. The stronger the basicity of catalyst used, the better the yield obtained. Guanidines and DBU catalysts could achieve good to excellent yields ( Table 1 , entries 9\u201311). N , N , N \u2032, N \u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine ( Table 1 , entry 7) and DMAP ( Table 1 , entry 8) could also catalyze cyanosilylation of ketones with moderate yields. On the other hand, tertiary amines such as Et 3 N, Pr 2 i NEt were detected to have catalytic effect on this reaction with poor yields ( Table 1 , entries 5 and 6). When pyrrolidine, Et 2 NH and other alkalescent amines ( Table 1 , entries 1\u20134) were employed as catalysts, no reaction was observed. In addition, when 2-benzoyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine was used, an obvious decrease of the yield was observed compared with TMG catalyst. This might be due to the decrease of the basicity comparing with tetramethylguanidine ( Table 1 , entry 12). A mechanism of the cyanosilylation of ketones catalyzed by TMG was proposed ( Scheme 2 ). In this reaction, electrophilic silicon atom was activated by a catalytic amount of TMG. The TMG could be converted to reactive, but resonance-stabilized, guanidinium salt A by quarternization with TMSCN (when TMSCN and TMG were mixed, colorless crystal was formed). 22 The key intermediate A readily reacted with ketone, via six-membered ring transition states B and C , to give the corresponding cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ether along with TMG. The catalytic system was applicable for a wide range of carbonyl compounds with excellent yield. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The data illustrated in Table 2 demonstrates that a variety of aryl and alkyl ketones may be employed in the TMG-catalyzed process and give the corresponding trimethylsilyl ethers in 90\u201399% yields. Ketones bearing electron-donating groups such as Me\u2013 or MeO\u2013 ( Table 2 , entries 6 and 7), were more active than those with electron-withdrawing groups ( Table 2 , entries 8\u201312). The reaction with aliphatic ketones afforded the corresponding products in very good yields in shorter time compared with aromatic and heterocyclic ketones ( Table 2 , entries 18 and 19). The reactions may also be performed with lower catalyst loading (0.1 mol %) by prolonging the reaction time ( Table 2 , entry 5). Although TMG was optimized for the reaction of ketones, it was also found to be an efficient catalyst for the cyanosilylation of aldehydes. Thus, both benzaldehyde and isobutylaldehyde underwent cyanosilylation with TMG (0.1 mol %) within 4 h in 99% yields ( Table 2 , entries 1 and 20). Less catalyst loading required longer reaction time. The reaction can be carried out by simply keeping the reaction mixture in a vial to stand in a 25 \u00b0C water bath without stirring. Enlarging the reaction scale to 10 mmol without stirring did not affect the cyanosilylation rate ( Table 2 , entry 3). After the first run, colorless crystal guanidinium salt A , which was considered to be a stable catalytic intermediate, was obtained by filtration. It can be used directly for the second run ( Table 2 , entry 4) with nearly the same activities (up to 99% yield within 8.5 h). In summary, we have identified a readily available organic catalyst that effectively promoted the cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds with low catalyst loading under mild conditions. This guanidine-catalyzed reaction may contribute to the development of green chemistry because of its possible application in solvent-free condition. Moreover, it provided a feasible direction of the asymmetric reaction by using the chiral guanidine. Chiral guanidine-catalyzed enantioselective cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds is currently under investigation.

        "abstract": "Although high enantioselectivity of [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of sulfonium ylides (Doyle-Kirmse reaction) has proven surprisingly elusive using classic chiral Rh(II) and Cu(I) catalysts, in principle it is due to the difficulty in fine discrimination of the heterotopic lone pairs of sulfur and chirality inversion at sulfur of sulfonium ylides. Here, we show that the synergistic merger of new \u03b1-diazo pyrazoleamides and chiral N,N'-dioxide-nickel(II) complex catalyst enables a highly enantioselective Doyle-Kirmse reaction. Pyrazoleamide substituent serves as both an activating and a directing group for the readily formation of metal-carbene and Lewis-acid bonded ylide intermediate in the assistant of dual tasking nickel(II) complex. An alternative chiral Lewis acid-bonded ylide pathway greatly improves the product enantiopurity even for the reaction of a symmetric diallylsulfane. A majority of transformations over a series of aryl or vinyl substituted \u03b1-diazo pyrazoleamindes and sulfides proceed rapidly (within 5-20 minutes in most cases) with excellent results (up to 99% yield and 96% ee), providing a breakthrough in enantioselective Doyle-Kirmse reaction.",

Both aromatic and aliphatic \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated \u03b1-ketoesters were found to be suitable substrates for the reactions. Moreover, the chemoselectivity of the DA and HDA adducts were improved by regulating the reaction temperature. Good to high chemoselectivity (up to 94%) of the DA adducts were obtained at room temperature, and moderate chemoselectivity (up to 65%) of the HDA adducts were achieved at low temperature. The reaction also featured mild reaction conditions, a simple procedure, and remarkably low catalyst loading (0.1-1.5 mol%). A strong positive nonlinear effect was observed.",

The modified electrodes were stable enough to be continuously used for one week (more than 30 times regeneration) with lower than 10% decrease in the response. They retained their initial activity for more than one month if used once a day. The calibration curve was linear for Cu2+ from 0.6 to 158.8 \u03bcg L\u22121 with a detection limit of 0.38 \u03bcg L\u22121. The relative standard deviation was 3.2% for a series of six successive measurements. The proposed method was applied in the determination of Cu2+ in mineral water and human hair samples.",

After detailed screening of the reaction parameters, mild optimized reaction conditions were established, affording 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyranamines in up to 99\u2009% yield, 99\u2009% ee and more than 95:5 d.r. The catalytic system was also efficient for \u03b2-substituted acyclic enecarbamates, affording more challenging 2,3,4-trisubstituted 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyranamine with three contiguous stereogenic centers in excellent yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities. The reaction could be scaled up to a gram scale with no deterioration of either enantioselectivity or yield.

        "title": "Highly enantioselective cyanosilylation of ketones catalyzed by a bifunctional Ti(IV) complex",
        "abstract": "A bifunctional catalyst system composed of ( S )-prolinamide ( 2a ), titanium(IV) isopropoxide, and phenolic N -oxide ( 3f ) exhibited high catalytic efficiency in the enantioselective cyanosilylation of ketones. In the presence of 2.5 mol % catalyst, a variety of aromatic and aliphatic ketones were converted into the corresponding tertiary cyanohydrin O -TMS ethers in excellent yields (up to 96%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee). A proposed catalytic cycle was illustrated to explain the origin of the asymmetric induction. Graphical abstract Keywords Bifunctional catalysis Cyanosilylation Ketone Titanium 1 Introduction The cyanosilylation of ketones is one of the most popular strategies to afford tertiary cyanohydrins which can be easily converted into versatile biologically active molecules and natural products. 1,2a,14b Many synthetic methods have been developed to accomplish the asymmetric cyanosilylation of ketones successfully. 2 The majority of chiral catalysts used in this reaction are chiral metal complexes, 3\u20139a cinchona alkaloid catalysts, 10 chiral oxazaborolidinium ions, 11 thiourea catalysts, 12 and amino acid salts. 13 In recent years, the synergistic activation by the combination of Lewis acids and Lewis bases is remarkable in asymmetric catalysis. 14 This dual activation concept has been successfully applied to the asymmetric addition of TMSCN to ketones, especially by Shibasaki's sugar-derivated bifunctional catalyst 2c,4 and our group's dual activation method. 7 We initiated our study on the asymmetric cyanosilylation of ketones with a bifunctional catalyst, which was composed of chiral ligand with central metal and achiral N -oxide. In the process of seeking for the appropriate chiral ligands, we synthesized 2a structurally similar to 1a 15 and 1b 16 ( Fig.\u00a01 ), both of which were efficient ligands in the asymmetric cyanosilylation of aldehydes. Herein, we wish to describe the enantioselective cyanosilylation of ketones catalyzed by a bifunctional 2a \u2013Ti(IV)\u2013 3f complex. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst survey A series of chiral ligands 2a \u2013 j and achiral N -oxides 3a \u2013 i ( Fig.\u00a02 ) were synthesized according to the reported methods. 7d,9b,17 The catalyst components were screened in the asymmetric cyanosilylation of acetophenone 4a ( Table 1 ). We began our efforts to evaluate the reactivity of 2 \u2013Ti(O i Pr) 4 complex. As depicted in entries 1\u201310 ( Table 1 ), electronic and steric tuning of the ligand was crucial for the reactivity and enantioselectivity. The amide moiety of the ligand had a significant effect on the results ( Table 1 , entries 1\u20137). Complex 2a \u2013Ti(IV) containing diphenylmethylamide moiety gave the best enantioselectivity ( Table 1 , entry 1). Ligands derived from other amide groups, no matter bulkier ones or the ones of less steric hindrance, only gave inferior asymmetric induction ( Table 1 , entries 2\u20137). It was noteworthy that halogen and\u00a0bulky tert -butyl moieties on the phenolic units of the ligands led to decrease in enantioselectivities ( Table 1 , entries 8\u201310). Then, 2a \u2013Ti(O i Pr) 4 was chosen to investigate the achiral N -oxides 3a \u2013 i . This bifunctional catalyst 2a \u2013Ti(IV)\u2013 3 was prepared in situ (see Section 4 for details). To our delight, the reactivity was greatly improved by the addition of 3a \u2013 g under the prescribed condition ( Table 1 , entries 11\u201317). A dramatic switching of enantioselectivity was dependent on the structure of N -oxides. As shown in entries 12 and 13 ( Table 1 ), a slight erosion in enantioselectivity was observed when 3b or 3c was used. This demonstrated that methoxyl or phenyl substitute at ortho position of phenolic group was not appropriate. Improvement in the enantioselectivity could be achieved by employing 3e and 3f , which could be attributed to the large hindrance of adamantyl ( Table 1 , entries 15 and 16). 62% ee was obtained with 2a \u2013Ti(IV)\u2013 3f complex ( Table 1 , entry 16). The sharp decrease in enantioselectivity was observed when 3g was employed, which could be partly due to the less flexible six-membered ring of N -oxide moiety ( Table 1 , entry 17). While simple N -oxides with no coordinative phenolic group were used, only poor results were obtained ( Table 1 , entries 18 and 19). This observation might be explained by the strong binding between Lewis acid and Lewis base resulting in the deterioration of the catalytic capability. It was found that acetophenone was converted into the corresponding product with 29% ee when Ti(O i Pr) 4 was replaced by Al(O i Pr) 3 ( Table 1 , entry 20 vs 16). Simultaneously, no product was observed by employing Zr(O i Pr) 4 or Zn(OTf) 2 . Thus, complex 2a \u2013Ti(IV)\u2013 3f was the optimal catalyst for further investigation. 2.2 Evaluation of the molar ratio of 2a , 3f , and Ti(O i Pr) 4 The molar ratio of 2a , 3f , and Ti(O i Pr) 4 was finely tuned to obtain the optimum enantioselectivity. The results are summarized in Table 2 . It was clearly showed that the molar ratio of 1/1/1 was crucial for both enantioselectivity and reactivity ( Table 2 , entry 3). Others only led to lower yields or enantioselectivity ( Table 2 , entries 1, 2, and 4\u20136). 2.3 Optimization of reaction conditions The solvent effect was investigated and the results are listed in Table 3 . The reactions proceeded more rapidly in ether solvents ( Table 3 , entries 1 and 2), but more sluggishly in CH 3 CN ( Table 3 , entry 3). Toluene provided equal enantioselectivity as THF, whereas the reaction rate was lower ( Table 3 , entry 4 vs 2). Although the transformation proceeded better in Et 2 O than in THF at \u221220 \u00b0C, lower temperature led to a dramatic decrease in reactivity ( Table 3 , entry 6 vs 1), while remarkable increase of enantioselectivity could be accomplished in THF at \u221245 \u00b0C with 90% yield and 86% ee by prolonging reaction time ( Table 3 , entry 7 vs 2). Further decreasing the temperature to \u221278 \u00b0C gave very low yield ( Table 3 , entry 8 vs 7). Hence, THF was the appropriate solvent. The effect of catalyst loading was screened and the results are listed in Table 4 . Increasing catalyst loading had little influence on the enantioselectivity, but it increased the reaction rate to some extent ( Table 4 , entries 1 and 2). When the catalyst loading was reduced to 1 mol %, the yield decreased to 67% ( Table 4 , entry 5). Thus the 2.5 mol % catalyst was considered to be the practical amount. The reaction concentration also had effect on the reaction rate and enantioselectivity. When the concentration of acetophenone was increased from 0.25 to 1.0 M, the yield was increased from 89 to 96% and up to 90% ee was achieved ( Table 4 , entries 6\u20138 vs 4). Additionally, further increase of the concentration of acetophenone to 1.5 M led to a slight loss of enantioselectivity ( Table 4 , entry 9). Consequently, the optimal working condition was 2.5 mol % 2a /Ti(O i Pr) 4 / 3f (1/1/1) at the concentration of acetophenone 1.0 M in THF at \u221245 \u00b0C. 2.4 Scope of the substrates As described in Table 5 , 2a \u2013Ti(O i Pr) 4 \u2013 3f was proved to be general for the enantioselective cyanosilylation of a wide range of ketones under the optimized conditions. The ortho and para fluoro-substituted aromatic ketones gave the same enantioselectivity as acetophenone ( Table 5 , entries 2 and 3 vs 1). Moreover, 4-chloroacetophenone and 4-methoxyacetophenone were converted into the desired products in 89% ee with 90 and 88% yields, respectively ( Table 5 , entries 5 and 7). The electronic character of ortho or para substituent of acetophenone was not crucial for the enantioselectivity ( Table 5 , entries 2, 3, and 5\u20137). 3-Chloroacetophenone afforded higher enantioselectivity ( Table 5 , entry 4 vs 1). When heterocyclic ketone 4h was subjected to the reaction, up to 92% ee was attained ( Table 5 , entry 8). Steric bulkier ketones such as \u03b2-acetonaphthone and \u03b1-tetralone afforded the corresponding cyanohydrin ethers with 96 and 85% ee, respectively ( Table 5 , entries 9 and 10). \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated ketone 4k was well tolerated and gave 1,2-addition product exclusively in 92% yield with 91% ee. Moreover, simple aliphatic and \u03b1,\u03b2-saturated ketones afforded the desired products in high yields with good enantioselectivities ( Table 5 , entries 12\u201316). 2.5 Mechanism investigation Nonlinear effects in asymmetric synthesis and stereoselective reactions reflect molecular interactions and complexity in reaction mechanism. 18 NLE study manifested that a double-shape curve was apparent from the experimental data in 2a \u2013Ti(O i Pr) 4 \u2013 3f complex catalytic system ( Fig.\u00a03 ). Here, we considered that the different catalyst species including monomeric species ( Fig.\u00a04 , model B ), dimeric species ( Fig.\u00a04 , model C ), and other higher order species might coexist in the catalytic process. Either B or C could act as a bifunctional catalyst through a similar dual activation pathway. Therefore, a simplified asymmetric catalytic cycle with a bifunctional pathway is illustrated in Scheme 1 . Tridentate ligand 2a could coordinate with Ti(O i Pr) 4 through oxygen atom and two amide moieties, meanwhile, 3f could assemble with titanium through phenolic group to form 7 . Titanium(IV) could act as a Lewis acid to activate carbonyl group and N -oxide moiety could act as Lewis base to activate TMSCN, simultaneously. In transition state 9 , the large steric hindrance between R group of the ketone and two phenyl groups of the amide might direct the activated CN attacked the carbonyl group from the less hindered side. Then the corresponding O -TMS ethers 5 could be released with the regeneration of the catalyst. 3 Conclusion In summary, we have developed a new strategy for asymmetric cyanosilylation of ketones using a new bifunctional catalyst. Attractive features of the reaction are the high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee), the low catalyst loading (2.5 mol %), and the ease of catalyst preparation. Based on the experimental results, catalyst species in this reaction and a plausible catalytic cycle were proposed. The applications of this bifunctional catalyst system in other asymmetric catalytic reactions are currently under investigations. 4 Experimental 4.1 General remarks 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 or 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million with the solvent reference as the internal standard (CHCl 3 : \u03b4 7.26 ppm). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, m=multiplet), and coupling constants (Hz). 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on a 75 or 100 MHz spectrometer with complete proton decoupling. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million with the solvent reference as the internal standard (CHCl 3 : \u03b4 77.2 ppm). Melting points were measured on a Mel-Temp apparatus and were uncorrected. Enantiomeric excesses (ee) were determined by HPLC or GC. Optical rotations were reported as follows: [\u03b1] D T ( c =g/100 mL, in solvent). HRMS was recorded on a commercial apparatus (ESI Source). All reagents were commercially available and used directly, except for acetophenone and TMSCN, which were distilled under argon. Solvents were all purified by the usual methods. The chiral ligands 2a \u2013 j and achiral N -oxides 3a \u2013 i were synthesized according to the reported methods. 7d,9b,17 4.2 Physical data of ligand 2a and N -oxide 3f 4.2.1 (2 S ,2\u2032 S )-1,1\u2032-(2-Hydroxy-5-methyl-1,3-phenylene)bis(methylene)bis( N -benzhydrylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide) ( 2a ) White powder, mp: 84\u201386 \u00b0C.

After cooling to 23 \u00b0C, the corresponding ketone (0.5 mmol) was added to this solution, followed by the addition of TMSCN (187 \u03bcL, 4 M in THF, 0.75 mmol) at \u221245 \u00b0C. The contents were stirred at \u221245 \u00b0C and the reaction was monitored by TLC. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatograghy (petroleum ether/diethyl ether, 100/1, v/v) to afford the corresponding cyanohydrin trimethylsilyl ether. 4.3.1 2-Trimethylsilyloxy-2-phenylpropanenitrile ( 5a ) Yield 96%, 90% ee. 1 H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 0.19 (s, 9H), 1.87 (s, 3H), 7.38\u20137.58 (m, 5H) ppm.

The chiral ligand, N , N\u2032 -dioxide, coordinated with scandium(III) triflate forming an organic\u2013metal complex as a chiral selector. Then the LAN enantiomers reacted with the selector and generated different signals in fluorescence. A distinct enantiomeric difference was observed with good repeatability, low detection limit, good linear range, and highly enantiomeric selectivity. At last, this study had offered a quantitative measurement of the enantiomer composition.",

        "abstract": "A new self-assembled catalyst based on titanium complex has been developed for the effective enantioselective cyano-ethoxycarbonylation of aldehydes. The self-assembled catalyst was readily prepared from ( R )-3,3\u2032-bis((methyl(( S )-1-phenylethyl)amino)methyl)-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl-2,2\u2032-diol ( 1h ), N -(( 1S , 2R )-2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethyl)acetamide ( 2b ), and tetraisopropyl titanate (Ti(O i Pr) 4 ). A variety of aromatic aldehydes, aliphatic aldehydes, and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes were found to be suitable substrates in the presence of the self-assembled titanium catalyst (5 mol % 1h , 5 mol % 2b , and 5 mol % Ti(O i Pr) 4 ). The desired cyanohydrin ethyl carbonates were afforded with high isolated yields (up to 95%) and moderate to good enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee) under mild conditions (at \u221215 \u00b0C). A possible catalytic cycle based on the experimental observation was proposed. Graphical abstract Keywords Asymmetric catalysis Binol Cyanation Self-assembly Titanium 1 Introduction The asymmetric cyanation of carbonyl compounds is a useful synthetic method to prepare optically active cyanohydrins, which are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of natural products and biologically active compounds. 1 However, in contrast to the cyanation of aldehydes and ketones employing trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as the cyanide source in which considerable progress has been made, 2,3 the one-pot catalytic asymmetric cyanation-O-protection reaction is still less developed. Recently, several successful catalyst systems employing cyanoformate (ROCOCN), acetyl cyanide or diethyl cyanophosphonate have been studied. 4\u20137 Among these precedents, Deng reported a dimeric cinchona alkaloid derivative for the one-pot enantioselective cyanation of aliphatic ketones. 4 Shibasaki and Sansano et\u00a0al. reported heterobimetallic complex {YLi 3 [tris(binaphthoxide)]} and BINOLAM\u2013Al or \u2013Ti(IV) complex for the addition of cyanoformate (ROCOCN) to aldehydes. 5 Belokon', North, and Moberg developed a bimetallic titanium complex, and obtained the desired O -alkoxycarbonyl cyanohydrins with excellent results. 6 Very recently, our group investigated multicomponent titanium complex, N , N -dioxide titanium complex, mononuclear salen titanium, and heterobimetallic aluminum lithium bis(binaphthoxide) in cyano-ethoxycarbonylation of aldehydes, with good yields and enantioselectivities. 7 In a different reaction, Mikami and Chan et\u00a0al. reported self-assembly of two different chiral ligand components into a highly enantioselective titanium catalyst for carbonyl-ene reaction and addition of alkynylzinc to aldehydes. 8 Inspired by this method, we continued to search for a new highly efficient catalyst system using BINOL derivatives in combination with amino alcohol to achieve structural diversity. Thus, a set of BINOL derivatives 1a \u2013 i and some chiral amino alcohol ligands 2a \u2013 i were investigated (synthesis for ligands: see Section 4 for details). Herein, we wish to report these ligands that engender a more effective catalyst by self-assembly for the cyano-ethoxycarbonylation of aldehydes. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst precursor screening In the preliminary studies, 10 mol % complexes of 1 -Ti(O i Pr) 4 were evaluated for the addition of ethyl cyanoformate to benzaldehyde in dry CH 2 Cl 2 at \u221215 \u00b0C ( Table 1 , entries 1\u201310). It was found that the complex of 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 gave the best result (55% ee and 96% yield after 24 h, Table 1 , entry 8). The reaction with complex of 1g -Ti(O i Pr) 4 was slower, although it showed comparable enantioselectivity with 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 ( Table 1 , entry 7). In contrast, the titanium complexes of binol ( 1a ), phosphorus-containing 1b or silicon-containing 1c , nitrogen-containing BINOL derivatives 1d and 1e , did not catalyze the reaction under same reaction conditions ( Table 1 , entries 1\u20135). Gratifyingly, when the loading of 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 complex was decreased from 10 to 5 mol %, higher enantioselectivity was achieved, although longer reaction time was required (87% ee after 48 h, Table 1 , entry 10) ( Fig.\u00a01 ). 2.2 Chiral activator screening To gain higher reactivity, some chiral activators 8a,b 2a \u2013 i were investigated fixing 5 mol % 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 complex as the catalyst precursor ( Table 2 , entries 2 and 3, and 5\u201311). To our delight, when 5 mol % chiral acetamide 2b was added together with 5 mol % 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 complex, higher enantioselectivity was obtained and the reactivity was increased dramatically ( Table 2 , entry 3 vs 1), which might be attributed to the hydrogen bonding between the N\u2013H moiety of acetamide with the oxygen atom of ethyl cyanoformate. Other combinations of chiral ligand with 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 complex gave lower ee's, although higher reactivity was observed ( Table 2 , entries 2, 5\u201311). The combination of titanium binol complex with acetamide 2b was also tested, but no product was detected ( Table 2 , entry 4). Therefore, 2b was selected as the best chiral activator in the self-assembled catalytic system ( Fig.\u00a02 ). 2.3 Catalyst system optimization In the further studies, we found that the optimum ratio of chiral ligands ( 1h and 2b ) to Ti(O i Pr) 4 was 5/5/5 ( Table 3 , entry 1 vs entries 2\u20138). Other ratios gave moderate enantioselectivity and reactivity ( Table 3 , entries 3 and 4, and 6\u20138). Changing the ratio of chiral ligands 1h , 2b , and Ti(O i Pr) 4 to 2.5/5/2.5 greatly decreased the reactivity ( Table 3 , entry 5). We also found that the desired product could not be obtained when titanium chiral acetamide 2b was used as the catalyst ( Table 3 , entry 2). Reaction solvent and other metal reagents were also examined ( Table 4 , entries 1\u201310). Among the investigated solvents, ether solvents (THF or Et 2 O) were found to afford the product in very low yields ( Table 4 , entries 2 and 3). Toluene gave moderate enantioselectivity and reactivity ( Table 4 , entry 4). The best result was obtained with CH 2 Cl 2 ( Table 4 , entry 1). When other metal reagents were employed in the\u00a0reaction, such as Al(O i Pr) 3 , Zr(O i Pr) 4 , Sm(O i Pr) 3 , Yb(TfO) 2 , and Cu(TfO) 2 , dissatisfactory results were obtained ( Table 4 , entries 5\u20139). Lowering the concentration of benzaldehyde from 0.5 to 0.25 resulted in lower yield and enantioselectivity ( Table 5 , entry 2). In contrast, the higher yields were obtained when the concentration of benzaldehyde was increased from 0.5 to 0.75 or 1.0, but the enantioselectivity was slightly decreased ( Table 5 , entries 3 and 4). Increasing the reaction temperature to 0 \u00b0C had little effect on the reactivity, but the enantioselectivity suffered ( Table 5 , entry 5). No product was observed after 48 h when the reaction temperature was lowered to \u221245 \u00b0C ( Table 5 , entry 6). 2.4 Substrate generality To probe the generality of the self-assembled titanium catalyst in the one-pot catalytic asymmetric cyano-ethoxycarbonylation of aldehydes, a variety of aldehydes were tested under the optimal conditions (5 mol % 1h , 5 mol % 2b , and 5 mol % Ti(O i Pr) 4 , concentration of aldehydes: 0.5 M in CH 2 Cl 2 , \u221215 \u00b0C), and the results are summarized in Table 6 . Moderate to good ee's were obtained in each case. 4-Methyl substituted benzaldehyde gave lower ee ( Table 6 , entry 2 vs 1), while methoxy or phenoxy substituted benzaldehyde was highly reactive and gave good ee ( Table 6 , entries 3\u20136). The product of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde 5f has been employed as a key intermediate in the synthesis of the insecticide fenvalerate Aa. 1e 4-Fluorobenzaldehyde gave 92% ee after 48 h ( Table 6 , entry 8). 2-Naphthaldehyde gave lower ee value ( Table 6 , entry 7), which might be attributed to the steric hindrance. The trans -cinnamaldehyde gave 91% ee after 48 h ( Table 6 , entry 9). It was noteworthy that the enantioselectivity of hexanal was greatly increased from 45 7b to 78% ee employing this self-assembled catalyst ( Table 6 , entry 10). When the temperature was lowered to \u221245 \u00b0C, better enantioselectivity of hexanal was afforded, but longer reaction time was required ( Table 6 , entry 11). Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and propionaldehyde gave 75% ee and 76% ee after 24 h, respectively ( Table 6 , entries 12 and 13). Isobutyraldehyde and pivalaldehyde gave the corresponding products with 62% ee and 74% ee after 24 h ( Table 6 , entries 14 and 15). We also investigated the corresponding aldehydes with 1h -Ti(O i Pr) 4 complex as catalyst under the same conditions (see Table 7 , entries 1\u201310). It was found that the reaction time was longer compared with the self-assembled system (48\u2013168 h). And the enantioselectivities were lower than the self-assembled catalyst system (58\u201387% ee; Table 7 , entries 1\u201313). These results revealed that the self-assembled titanium catalyst was effective for the addition of ethyl cyanoformate to aldehydes. 2.5 Catalytic cycle considerations According to the previous work in the field of cyano-ethoxycarbonylation of aldehyde and ketone, 4\u20136 the self-assembled titanium catalyst might play a multifunctional role in this reaction (see Fig.\u00a03 ). The metal moiety of complex I might act as Lewis acid to activate the aldehyde and engender the species II . On the other hand, the tertiary amine moiety of complex I might act as Lewis base to activate the ethyl cyanoformate (EtOCOCN), 4,5c,d and the hydrogen of acetamide ( 2b ) might coordinate weakly to the oxygen atom of ethyl cyanoformate, simultaneously. Then, the activated ethyl cyanoformate transfer the cyanide to the activated aldehyde and afford the corresponding product. At the same time, a catalytic cycle was completed. 3 Conclusions In conclusion, a new enantioselective catalyst for the synthesis of optically active cyanohydrins via ethyl cyanoformate addition to aldehydes has been developed. This study showed that a combination of two kinds of chiral ligands such as nitrogen-containing BINOL derivatives ( 1h ) and acetamide ( 2b ) with Ti(O i Pr) 4 generated an effective enantioselective catalyst. Compared with the multicomponent titanium catalyst, which we previously developed, the most remarkable features of this catalyst system include: (a) low amount of catalyst loading, (b) more effective for aliphatic aldehydes, (c) the mild reaction conditions, and (d) providing a different enantiomer of the cyanohydrin ethyl carbonates. The applications of the self-assembled titanium catalyst system in other asymmetric catalytic reactions are currently underway. 4 Experimental section 4.1 General methods 1 H NMR spectra were recorded with 300 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal standard (CDCl 3 , \u03b4 =7.26 ppm). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s-singlet, d-doublet, t-triplet, and m-multiplet), coupling constants (Hz), and integration. 13 C NMR spectroscopic data were collected with\u00a0a 75 MHz spectrometer with complete proton decoupling. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as internal standard (CDCl 3 , \u03b4 =77.0 ppm). Enantiomeric excesses were determined by chiral HPLC analysis on a Daicel Chiralcel OD-H column or chiral GC analysis on a Varian Chirasil DEX CB instrument in comparison with authentic racemates. Optical rotations were recorded as follows: [\u03b1] D T ( c ,\u00a0g/100 mL in solvent). HRMS was recorded with ESI source (in CH 3 OH). 4.2 Materials All liquid aldehydes were used after distilled; EtOCOCN was used directly without further purification. Solvents were purified by the usual methods. Binol and ligands 2d \u2013 i were commercially available. Ligands 1b \u2013 c , 9 1d , 3e 1e , 10 ( 1f and 1i) , 11 and 2a \u2013 c 12 were synthesized according to\u00a0the literature procedure.

The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 1.0 h. Then the solution was refluxed for 10 h under N 2 atmosphere after 5.0 mmol of HCHO (37% aqueous) was added. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and adjusted to pH 9\u201310 with K 2 CO 3 . The resulting mixture was extracted by CH 2 Cl 2 (3\u00d720 mL) and the combined organic phases were dried over MgSO 4 . After removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (3/1, v/v) as an eluent to give BINOL derivatives 1g and 1h . 4.2.1.1.1 ( R )-3,3\u2032-Bis((benzyl(methyl)amino)methyl)-1,1\u2032-binaphthyl-2,2\u2032-diol ( 1g ) Yield 87%; lightly yellow solid, mp 128\u2013130 \u00b0C, [\u03b1] D 23 +50.52 ( c 2.0 in CHCl 3 ). 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 ), \u03b4 =2.28 (s, 6H), 3.60 (d, J =12.9 Hz, 2H), 3.72 (d, J =13.1 Hz, 2H), 3.94 (d, J =13.7 Hz, 2H), 4.12\u20134.22 (m, 2H), 5.06 (s, 2H), 7.17\u20137.29 (m, 16H), 7.96 (s, 2H), 7.80 (d, J =8.0 Hz, 2H) ppm. 13 C NMR (CDCl 3 ), 41.02, 61.30, 61.75, 116.72, 122.93, 124.66, 124.85, 126.03, 127.52, 127.65, 127.89, 128.28, 128.43, 129.61, 133.96, 136.62, 153.62.

This transformation proceeded via allylboration/oxy-Cope rearrangement tandem process, providing a facile and rapid route to \u03b3-allyl-\u03b1-ketoesters with moderate to good yields (66-92%) and excellent ee values (90-99% ee). The isolation of 1,2-allylboration products enabled us to get insight into the mechanism of subsequent oxy-Cope rearrangement reaction: substrate-induced chiral transfer and chiral Lewis acid accelerated process. Based on the experimental investigations and DFT calculations, a rare boat-like transition-state model was proposed to elucidate the origin of high chirality transfer during the oxy-Cope rearrangement.",

TsNHX species (X=Cl, Br, I), generated from the reactions between the halo sources and TsNH(2), were further confirmed as the active species in the haloamination reactions involved in the formation of the key halonium ion intermediates. A typical haloamination dependency was observed, with reactivity decreasing in the order NBS>NIS\u226bNCS.",

        "abstract": "A new catalytic asymmetric tandem a-alkenyl addition/proton shift reaction of silyl enol ethers with ketimines was serendipitously discovered in the presence of chiral N,N'-dioxide/ZnII complexes. Proton shift preferentially occurred than silyl shift after a-alkenyl addition of silyl enol ether to ketimine. A wide range of b-amino silyl enol ethers were achieved in high yields with good to excellent ee values. Control experiments suggested that the Mukaiyama-Mannich reaction and tandem a-alkenyl addition/proton shift reaction were competitive reactions in the current catalytic system. Meanwhile, the obtained b-amino silyl enol ethers could easily transform into b-fluoroamines containing two vicinal tetrasubstituted carbon centers.",

        "title": "Direct observation of titanium-centered octahedra in titanium-antimony-tellurium phase-change material",
        "abstract": "Phase-change memory based on Ti0.4Sb2Te3 material has one order of magnitude faster Set speed and as low as one-fifth of the Reset energy compared with the conventional Ge2Sb2Te5 based device. However, the phase-transition mechanism of the Ti0.4Sb2Te3 material remains inconclusive due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. Here we report a direct atom-by-atom chemical identification of titanium-centered octahedra in crystalline Ti0.4Sb2Te3 material with a state-of-the-art atomic mapping technology. Further, by using soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density function theory simulations, we identify in amorphous Ti0.4Sb2Te3 the titanium atoms preferably maintain the octahedral configuration. Our work may pave the way to more thorough understanding and tailoring of the nature of the Ti\u2013Sb\u2013Te material, for promoting the development of dynamic random access memory-like phase-change memory as an emerging storage-class memory to reform current memory hierarchy. The performance gap between processor and memory has been widened in recent years since massively parallel computing with multicore processors being utilized1. An emerging storage-class memory (SCM) technology was introduced to mitigate the bottleneck, which concerns the entire computing system1, 2. To reform the conventional memory hierarchy, the SCM technology needs to combine the attributes of memory and storage; that is to say, the performances of SCM are hoped to match commodity dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while the capacity and cost of SCM shall be able to compete with NAND Flash memory1. Phase-change memory (PCM) has been regarded as the most promising candidate to replace incumbent NAND Flash memory as well as DRAM for SCM application1, 3, 4. In terms of the speed, power, and endurance, the fact is PCM already has overall better bit performances than those of the NAND5. Obviously, multi-bits storage is indispensable to the evolution of a huge capacity NAND-like PCM. Hence, three-dimensional stacking of cells/arrays6, 7 or multi-level resistance drift limitation in single cell8, 9 will need a lot more work. Nevertheless, the key challenges to realize DRAM-like PCM still lie in how to further decrease Reset operation energy and further increase Set operation speed, because DRAM requires rigorously 10\u221211\u201310\u221212 J per bit program energy and <10\u2009ns access time4. The Reset operation of PCM, generally referring to the melt-quenching procedure, transforms the crystalline (c-) chalcogenide alloy, for example, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), into amorphous (a-) phase10, 11. Conversely, the Set operation is to heat the a-phase to a temperature between crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting point (Tm) to obtain the c-phase10, 11. Due to the slow crystallization speed (~30\u2009ns)3, 4 and high Tm (~616\u2009\u00b0C)12 of GST-based materials, many efforts, such as diminish the grain size, promote the nucleation, reduce the active volume and enhance the thermal efficiency, have been made to try to lower the power and expedite the response4, 13, 14, 15, 16. Our previous work proposed an alternative and simpler approach to develop DRAM-like PCM via merely replacing the switching material from GST to Ti0.4Sb2Te3 (TST) alloy17. We demonstrated at least one order of magnitude faster Set speed and as low as one-fifth of the Reset energy on TST-based PCM cell compared with those of GST cell with the same size17. Nevertheless, the origin of such performance improvements yet is controversial18 and not fully understood because of the lack of solid experimental evidences. In the present work, we apply Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) simulations to explore the phase transition mechanism of TST material in a more accurate way. We report that the Ti-centered octahedra (TCOs) not only disperse inside of the hexagonal (HEX) Sb2Te3 (ST) lattice, but also form nano-lamellae separated outside, respectively acting as lattice distortion centers and nano-thermal insulators to induce low-energy amorphization of the restricted ST crystal grains. We also identify that in a-TST, the Ti atoms prefer to maintain the octahedral configuration. Such robust TCOs or nano-lamellae thus may serve as intrinsic nucleation centers or templates for surrounding Sb-centered atomic motifs to swiftly align into long-range order to achieve high-speed recrystallization. An understanding of the phase-transition mechanism of TST from the atomic and electronic structure points of view is essential for further material optimization to meet the requirements of future DRAM-like PCM application. From the STEM bright-field (BF) image of c-TST (Fig. 1a), several atomically resolved triple-layered lamellae can be clearly observed. They locate adjacent to the quintuple layers (QLs). Figure 1b shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM image of the triple-layered lamellae zooming into the field marked by dashed line in Fig. 1a. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mappings of the Ti, Sb and Te elements for the corresponding zooming area in Fig. 1b are given by Fig. 1c\u2013e, respectively. The triple-layered lamellae are determined to be composed with a stacking sequence of -v-Te-Ti-Te-v-Te-Ti-Te-v-Te-Ti-Te-v- (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1), where v denotes the van der Waals interaction gap. Such stacking sequence is the typical HEX lattice structure of TiTe2 (TT) with lattice parameter a=3.77\u2009\u00c5 (ref. 19). While the adjacent QLs are believed to be -v-Te-Sb-Te-Sb-Te-v- stacking structure of HEX- ST with a little larger lattice parameter a=4.25\u2009\u00c5 (ref. 20), which can be confirmed in Fig. 2. Although TT and ST were commonly used to construct superlattice-like materials21, the ~11% mismatch of a between TT and ST blocks still tends to result in the phase segregation. Differently magnified STEM-HAADF images and the corresponding EDS mappings of other observing regions in the same c-TST sample also confirm this segregation phenomenon that the ST crystal grains are shrunk or even cut into pieces by the TT lamellae (TTL) (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). In contrast, the a values of GeTe (GT) and ST constructing the flagship GST alloy only deviate slightly (~2.2% for HEX lattice and ~1.0% for rocksalt lattice)20. Thus, unlike the incompatibility between TT and ST, it would be rare to find severe GT segregation out of ST in c-GST phase. Nevertheless, the smaller ST crystal grains defined by TT in c-TST may be helpful to boost the speed and power performances of PCM14. The HAADF image (Fig. 2a) shows the clear ST-like HEX lattice structure of the QLs in c-TST, which is atom-by-atom chemically identified as -v-Te(1)-Sb-Te(2)-Sb-Te(1)-v- stacking sequence (Fig. 2b), where subscripts (1) and (2), respectively, refer to 3-coordinated and 6-coordinated Te atoms. To be noted that there are non-ignorable Ti signals simultaneously detected in some Sb layers (Fig. 2c), which indicates that dopant Ti atoms can occupy Sb lattice sites in the HEX-ST lattice17. It is also worthy of pointing out that not all the QLs of ST in c-TST accommodate the Ti dopants (Supplementary Fig. 4). Given above, the representative lattice structure of HEX-TST should be depicted as the model presented in Fig. 3 from which, in addition to the pure ST QLs, one may also find the separated TTL as well as the TCOs scattered in ST QLs. The charge density difference22 maps indicate that in the Sb-centered octahedron, there are three strong and three weak bonds23; while among Ti and its six Te ligands in the TCO, there are six equally stronger covalent-like bonds formed by overlapping Ti-3d and Te-5p orbitals, which are quite similar with the electronic configuration of pure HEX-TT24, 25. Due to the stronger Ti-Te(2) bonds, the Te(2)-Sb bonds in the adjacent layer without the Ti are significantly elongated and weakened, as indicated in Fig. 3 by dashed lines. The rigid TCOs possibly bring tensile stress to the ST QLs, and those fragile Te(2)\u2013Sb bonds have to be deformed to accommodate such lattice distortion. Thus, with more Ti atoms occupying in the same Sb layer, the interlayer distance (d1\u22481.9\u2009\u00c5) between Sb(Ti) and Te(2) layers is found to be a little smaller than that (d2\u22482.1\u2009\u00c5) between the Te(2) and Sb layers (Fig. 3). This subtle interspace expansion is also pointed out by black arrows in Fig. 2a,d. In comparison, there should be no such inter-distance variation for Sb\u2013Te(2)-Sb layers (d3\u22482.0\u2009\u00c5) in pure ST QLs (Fig. 3). During amorphization the fragile Te(2)-Sb bonds will be easily ruptured to destroy the long-range order, leading to a low-energy Reset operation. By contrast, the TTL with all rigid Ti-Te bonds may tend to keep its ordered configuration in amorphization, and in reverse effectively restrict the growth of ST grain. Since the quasi-two-dimensional c-TT is semimetallic25, and also has quite lower thermal conductivity (0.12\u2009W\u2009mK\u22121)26 than those of c-GST (0.41\u2009W\u2009mK\u22121)27 and c-ST (0.78\u2009W\u2009mK\u22121)28, electric current shall be more conveniently conducted to the small ST grains to generate Joule heat that is insulated by adjacent TTL to accomplish a highly efficient Reset operation. Comparing with our previous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) result of TST material17, the remeasured DSC curve (Supplementary Fig. 5) expands the measuring temperature from ~600 to ~650\u2009\u00b0C. Here we only focus on the melting procedures. The onsets of two endothermic peaks at ~557 and ~603\u2009\u00b0C are taken as the first and the second Tms of TST material, respectively. Note that most of the heat is consumed by the second melting process which has a lower Tm than that of pure ST (~618\u2009\u00b0C)12, 29. Chemically, we can rewrite the c-Ti0.4Sb2Te3 stoichiometry into (TiTe2)xTi0.4-xSb2Te3\u22122x (0<x<0.4), where (TiTe2)x part accounts for the TTL located outside of the ST QLs, then the rest Ti0.4\u2212xTe0.8\u22122x from Ti0.4\u2212xSb2Te3\u22122x part should be considered as the TCOs inside of some ST QLs. Note that the Ti0.4\u2212xSb2Te3\u22122x part (0<x<0.4) resembles the Sb-rich Sb-Te compound (2/3< Sb at.%/Te at.% <2/2.2) whose widely accepted microstructural fingerprint is the Sb2 bilayers stacking adjacent to some ST QLs30, 31. Indeed, we also observed such structure of minority from individual crystal grains in c-TST (marked by black arrows in Supplementary Fig. 6). No doubt, this Sb-rich composition can naturally help to result in a faster crystallization speed than that of a-GST30. However, without accurately quantifying the value of x, we cannot determine the repeated stacking manner of Sb2 and ST blocks for Ti0.4\u2212xSb2Te3\u22122x part, thus we prefer not to include the Sb2 bilayer in the representative lattice model of HEX-TST shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, because pure TT material has quite larger Tm (>1,200\u2009\u00b0C) than those of the Sb\u2013Te compounds29, 32, it is rational to deduce the TTL and TCOs could be unmelted during c-TST amorphization. Actually, our in situ X-ray diffraction results of pure TT film on Si substrate verify that even at 700\u2009\u00b0C (>Tm of TST) (Supplementary Fig. 7), TT film still maintains good crystallinity with a typical HEX lattice structure32. Therefore, we believe the Ti0.4\u2212xSb2Te3\u22122x part in TST play the major role in causing the two consecutive melting processes resembling the case of pure Sb-rich Sb\u2013Te compounds29; especially the robust TCOs highly distort the HEX-ST lattice, promoting the significant decrease of the second Tm. On the other hand, in recrystallization, we speculate that the long-range ordered TTL and the structurally similar TCOs may serve as the heterogeneous nucleation templates or centers for neighbouring distorted or destructive Sb-centered octahedra to easily and swiftly align into long-range order13, 14, 33, 34. This ordering mechanism is qualitatively different with the one of a-GST that involves a reconfiguration of considerable tetrahedrally bonded Ge atoms to octahedrally bonded ones35, 36 or a cavity-supported reorientation of four-membered ring structures37, 38. In this regard, we also note that in Si doped ST material, Si and ST exhibit nano-scale phase segregation morphology resembling that of TST; namely, dopant Si atoms keep in the a-phase outside of the ST-rich areas and do not participate in the phase transition39. Nevertheless, the a-Si phase cannot play the role of inducing swift recrystallization of the a-ST phase because of the complete lattice mismatch between a-Si and c-ST, leading to a sluggish Set operation39. One may still inquiry whether the Ti atoms could keep their octahedral configurations even during high-temperature amorphization process. We thereby used sXAS method to verify the existence of TCOs in a-TST. The spot size of the incident X-ray beam for taking sXAS is about 1.5\u2009mm2. In contrast to the STEM for microstructural probe, the sXAS technique can provide the overall information in macroscopic scale. For 3d transition-metal (TM) compounds, sXAS involves the excitation of 2p core electrons to empty 3d orbitals (2p63dn to 2p53dn+1) through dipole selection rules40, 41. Thus, sXAS directly probes the TM 3d unoccupied electronic structures that is sensitive to its oxidation states, spin states, and local environment such as chemical bonding, symmetry and metal\u2013ligand distance. Figure 4a shows the Ti L-edge absorption spectra of TST film with 1\u2009K\u2009min\u22121 in situ heating rate. Note that the as deposited TST film is amorphous, and will begin to be crystallized when the in situ heating temperature reaches the Tc=451\u2009K (Supplementary Fig. 8). The absorption spectra are divided into L3 and L2 regions, corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels resulting from the 2p core-hole spin-orbital coupling, and further split to double-peak structure (labelled as A and B in Fig. 4a) by the crystal field generated by the Te atoms surrounding each Ti atom. To understand the effect of this crystal field on the electronic structure of TST, we perform the DFT calculation to analyse the electron density of states. Here we use HEX-TT (space group of P3m1 and point group of D3d)32 as a reference to analyse the sXAS spectrum taken at 513\u2009K corresponding to the c-TST phase. In contrast to the well-studied analogue TiO2 with point group of D4h (refs 42, 43), where the slightly distorted octahedron of O atoms leads the splitting of degeneracy Ti-3d orbitals into t2g and eg orbitals with an energy separation 10 Dq, the fivefold degenerate orbitals of HEX-TT are split into three parts: the upper two degenerate orbitals of and , the middle orbital of , and the rest two degenerate orbitals of and , as shown in Fig. 4b. The simulated Ti-L3 sXAS from electron-hole approximation is displayed in Fig. 4c, which shows the double peaks with energy separation about 1.6\u2009eV. This energy scale quantitatively agrees with that of the experimental sXAS spectra for c-TST (Fig. 4a). Although the ratio of double-peak intensities is not well reproduced that may due to the lack of considering the electron-hole interaction44, this distinction is trivial for our study that focuses on the effect of crystal field. Because the temperature-dependent sXAS spectra, in particular the crystal-field separation, display almost the identical features, the Ti electronic configurations should be nearly unchanged in both a- and c-TST phases. This is the evidence, from the electronic structure point of view, proving that the Ti atoms maintain in the octahedral configuration in a-phase. Furthermore, our ab initio molecular dynamics simulation on melting TST alloy (data not shown here) also indicates that the ST QLs can be adequately disordered while the TTL basically preserve the ordered triple-layered structures. In this regard, we speculate that the separated TTL are able to survive after amorphization if the Reset operation of the TST PCM cell can be carefully manipulated. It has great potentials to design a suitable heating profile (<Tm of pure TT) to preserve the ordered TTL inside a disordered a-ST network. Higher-quality STEM and EDS evidences of ordered TTL formed in Reset state of the TST PCM cell still need more work. In conclusion, STEM and sXAS studies of the TST material have revealed its essential microstructure feature that Ti atoms do exist in the octahedral configuration in both a- and c-phases. We have identified the dispersed TCOs in the HEX-ST QLs as well as the externally separated TTL. The former ones highly distort the ST lattice, while the latter ones effectively aggregate the heat in the small ST grains, both promoting the low-energy amorphization of c-TST. The octahedral configuration centered by Ti atom is proved to be prevailed in a-TST, which should originate from the strong covalent-like characteristic of Ti-Te bonds. The precise roles of the TTL and TCOs in triggering the swift recrystallization are not yet clear. We conjecture the long-range ordered TTL and the structurally similar TCOs may probably act as the medium for inducing the reorder of surrounding Sb-centered atomic motifs. The quantification of Ti contents in TTL and TCOs requires more study, and will be a great help to determining the lattice structure, understanding the phase transition mechanism and further optimizing the material composition for DRAM-like high-performance PCM application. In addition, the finding of intrinsic quasi-two-dimensional c-TT lamella in the polycrystalline TST alloy may open up the possibility of searching the topological insulating or superconducting properties from a lattice configuration well-controlled Ti\u2013Sb\u2013Te alloy45, 46. The composition of TST film was measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy using a Rigaku RIX 2100 system. TST film was deposited on silicon substrate at room temperature, and annealed at 250\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009min to get the c-phase17. Cross-sectional view TEM sample of TST film was prepared by using Ar ion milling method. The atomic identification was carried out by using JEOL ARM 300F and FEI Titan 300 with probe-corrected STEM mode. In situ heating sXAS measurements of 150-nm thick TST film (deposited on silicon substrate at room temperature and covered by 2-nm thick Au film to avoid oxidization) were performed at beamline 20A1 of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center at Taiwan. The beamline was equipped with a 6-m high-energy spherical grating monochromator to supply a photon beam with resolving power up to 8,000. The sXAS spectra were collected in total electron yield mode in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber with a base pressure about 5 \u00d7 10\u221210\u2009torr. All the spectra have been normalized to the photocurrent from the upstream clean gold mesh to eliminate the fluctuation of the beam flux. The photon energy was calibrated with the spectra of reference samples (SrTiO3) measured simultaneously. The lattice model of c-TST was investigated by employing the DFT47. The Vienna Ab initio Simulations Package48 was used. The projector augmented wave pseudopotentials49 were used for electron-ion interactions. For the exchange-correlation energies between electrons, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional50 was used. A 216-atom supercell was built with 19 Ti, 65 Sb and 132 Te atoms. To reproduce the lattice structure of c-TST, a triple-layered TT was inserted between a Te\u22efTe Van der Waals gap in HEX-ST and some Sb atoms were randomly replaced by dopant Ti atoms. The energy cutoff was set to 235\u2009eV. The \u0393 point was chosen for relaxation and a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\u2009k-point mesh was used for electrical properties studies. In addition, sXAS simulation of c-TT used the all-electron full potential linear augmented plane wave plus local orbitals method51 as implemented in the Wien2k code52. The exchange correlation potential was calculated also using the PBE functional. The absorption spectroscopy was obtained through using a supercell calculation, where we removed a core electron on one atom in the supercell of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, and added such electron into the conduction band.

A variety of 2-cyano-2-[hydroxyl(pyrydin-2-yl)amino]acetates with quaternary stereocenters and potential antibacterial activities were obtained in excellent yields with good to excellent ee values under as low as 0.05 mol% catalyst loading.

The methodology was also applied in the highly diastereoselective synthesis of d-galactal derivatives. The absolute configuration of the octahydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrroles showed that the reactions using 3,4-dihydropyran and 6-alkyl-substituted ones as substrates gave reversed diastereoselection in the final cyclization step.",

A chiral N,N'-dioxide Sc(OTf) complex served not only to promote formation of ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs) in situ but also induced the asymmetry of the reaction. This methodology enables a novel activation of ortho-hydroxybenzyl alcohols, thus affording the desired chiral diarylindol-2-ylmethanes in up to 99\u2009% yield and 99\u2009% ee. A range of functional groups were also tolerated under the mild reaction conditions. Moreover, this strategy gives concise access to enantioenriched indole-fused benzoxocines.",

Here we report a catalytic enantioselective dearomatization Claisen rearrangement of allyl furyl ethers catalyzed by chiral N,N'-dioxide-Ni complex catalysts. A variety of chiral \u03b3,\u03b4-unsaturated carbonyl compounds bearing vicinal quaternary-quaternary stereocenters were obtained with excellent outcomes under mild conditions. Furthermore, we disclosed that by matching the configuration of the catalysts and the alkene unit of the substrates, four stereoisomers of the products could be prepared in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Finally, the fascination of this strategy was demonstrated by stereodivergent synthesis of bioactive natural products hyperolactones B, C, and their epimers. A possible catalytic model was proposed to explain the origin of the asymmetric induction.",

In recent years, great progress has been made in this area with the use of various chiral metal complexes based on different chiral ligands. This review provides comprehensive and critical information on the enantioselective 1,4-conjugate addition of nonorganometallic (soft) nucleophiles and their importance in synthetic applications. The literature is covered from the last 10 years, and a number of examples from before 2007 are included as background information. The review is divided into multiple parts according to the type of nucleophile involved in the reaction (such as C-, B-, O-, N-, S-, P-, and Si-centered nucleophiles) and metal catalyst systems used.",

Diverse enantioenriched cyclobutanes were obtained in good results (up to 70% yields, >19:1 d.r., 92% ee). The new chiral terbium(III) complex features bathochromic shift, lower excitation energy, and facile intersystem crossing due to the paramagnetic and heavy-atom effects, enabling the antenna 2-alkenoyl pyridines to be excited. Comparatively, chiral N,N'-dioxide/ScIII complex in incorporation with Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was efficient in enantioselective photocycloadditions of 2'-hydroxychalcones with alkenes, revealing that both substrates and metal salts displayed significant effects on the reaction.",

This catalytic manifold allows a rapid construction of several classes of dimeric polycyclic compounds with good yield and high level of diastereo- and enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). Furthermore, in cases of the substrates with other alkyl linkage, the reactions proceeded to give macrocyclic dimers via intermolecular-homologation process.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, chiral guanidines and their derivatives have emerged as one of the most powerful organocatalysts mainly on the basis of their strong basicity and/or hydrogen-bond donor ability. Structurally diverse guanidine catalysts (bicyclic, monocyclic and acyclic types) sprang up and enabled numerous fundamental organic transformations to be realized in high efficiency and stereoselectivity. Moreover, chiral guanidinium salts were successfully employed in H-bond donor catalysis, phase-transfer catalysis and others. Recently, several novel chiral guanidine derivatives [e.g., guanidinium salt, pentanidium, bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane] have been designed and used for the synthesis of valuable molecules. In addition, the combination of chiral guanidines and their derivatives with cationic or anionic metal species dramatically expanded their utility and provided solutions to challenging transformations of importance which cannot be achieved with conventional chiral catalysts. This article reviews current achievements of chiral guanidines and their derivatives in organocatalysis, and updates versatile guanidine-metal salt combinations in asymmetric catalytic reactions. In addition, representative examples of achiral guanidine-related catalysis are also covered.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the descending inhibitory effect of the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN) treated with electrical stimulation on the cardiosomatic motor reflex (CMR) induced by intrapericardial capsaicin (IC) in rats and its mechanism. Methods: 22 male SD rats were randomly divided into electrical stimulation group (n = 7), electrical stimulation plus 3 g\u00b7L -1 yohimbine group(n = 5), electrical stimulation plus 5 g\u00b7L -1 yohimbine group (n = 5) and electrical stimulation plus vehicle group(n = 5). The electromyogram (EMG) changes of dorsal spinotrapezius muscle of CMR induced by IC of rats were observed following intervention with treatment factors in various groups. Results: Compared with control group, EMG could be inhibited by electrical stimulation of 10, 20 and 30 \u03bcA in LRN, the inhibitory effect was increased with the increasing of the electrical stimulation intensity accompanied or not accompanied with changes of blood pressure; the EMG reduced to 51.41%, 21.11% and 1.43% of the control (P<0.001); Compared with electrical stimulation (10 \u03bcA) group, intrathecal injection of adrenergic \u03b12 receptor antagonist yohimbine (3 and 5 g\u00b7L -1) reversed the inhibitory effects of LRN stimulation on CMR, the EMG responses increased from 41.34% to 72.40% and 78.73%, respectively (P<0.01). Conclusion: Electrical stimulation of LRN can produce descending inhibition on CMR and \u03b12-adrenoceptors at spinal cord level may be involved in the inhibition.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the changes of cardiac nociception and the expressions of vanilloid receptor subtype1 (VR1) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the myocardium of diabetic rats for the purpose of finding the relationship of cardiac nociception with VR1 and CGRP expressions. Methods: The diabetic model of Sprague Dawle (SD) rats was established with streptozotocin (STZ). Electrophysiology was used to observe the changes of cardiac nociception with intrapericardial capsaicin evoked electromyography (EMG) responses in the spinotrapezius muscle as an index; VR1 and CGRP expressions were detected by immunohistochemical technique. Results: Injection of CAP into intrapericardial sac could evoke SPT discharge. Compared with those of the controls, the latency of EMG evoked by intrapericardial capsaicin was prolonged [(9.8 \u00b1 4.1) s vs. (2.1 \u00b1 0.4) s], the average discharge rate was decreased [(30.3 \u00b1 5.9) imp/s vs. (120.0 \u00b1 20.5) imp/s, P < 0.05], and the expressions of VR1 and CGRP were significantly decreased in STZ-treated rats (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Cardiac nociception is decreased in diabetic rats, which may be due to the lower expressions of VR1 and CGRP in the myocardium.",

        "abstract": "The current study examined the role of the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN) in modulating the cardiosomatic reflex (CSR) induced by intrapericardial capsaicin in the anesthetized rat. Intrapericardial capsaicin was administered, and the CSR was monitored via electromyogram responses of the dorsal spinotrapezius muscle. Electrical stimulation of the LRN (10, 20 and 30 \u03bcA) depressed the CSR induced by intrapericardial capsaicin in an intensity-dependent manner. Microinjection of glutamate (4, 10, 20 and 40 nmol, in 0.2 \u03bcL) into the LRN replicated the effects of electrical stimulation. Furthermore, bilateral transections of the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) decreased the LRN electrical stimulation-induced inhibition of the electromyogram responses. Intrathecal administration of the \u03b12 -adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine or the serotonergic receptor antagonist methysergide significantly attenuated the LRN electrical stimulation-induced inhibition of the electromyogram responses. However, intrathecal application of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone had no effect on the LRN electrical stimulation-induced inhibition. These results suggest that the LRN-DLF-spinal cord pathway is involved in descending inhibition of the CSR, and spinal \u03b12 -adrenergic and serotonergic receptors participate in this descending inhibition.",

The morphous of hair follicles was observed consecutively and electron microscope was used.We found that in 1 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L sodium fluoride groups, when the human hair follicles in vitro were cultured on the 5th day, the apoptotic cells of outer root sheath (ORS), dermal sheath and hair papilla, hair bulb were obviously increased. But 0.01 mmol/L sodium selenite weakened the toxicity of 1 mmol/L sodium fluoride at the outer root sheath and hair bulb (P < 0.05).Different concentrations of sodium fluoride had different effect on the growth of human hair follicle in vitro which were cultured on 5th day. Sodium fluoride of certain concentration could accelerate the apoptosis of human hair follicle in vitro.

The spinotrapezius electromyography (EMG) activities as an index of cardiac-somatic motor reflex were recorded simultaneously.Compared with the pre-test controls (100%), saline did not make a significant change to the capsaicin-evoked EMG response (96. 9% +/- 12. 5%, P>0. 05); NMDA agonist increased the capsaicin-evoked EMG response (185. 2% +/- 24. 4%) significantly (P<0. 05); neither MK801 nor a combined administration of MK801 and NMDA made a significant change to the capsaicin-evoked EMG response (106. 6% +/- 10. 2%, P> 0.05); Sar-SP increased the capsaicin-evoked EMG response (145. 6% 10. 1%) significantly (P<0. 05); whereas neither CP-96345 nor a combined administration of CP-96345 and Sar-SP made a significant change to the capsaicin-evoked EMG response (102. 2% +/- 8. 4%, P>0.05).NMDA and NK1 receptors may have participated in the transmissions of cardiac nociception information in the spinal cords of rats.",

In this work,ethanol,n-propanol and several commonly used inorganic salts were attempted to develop the ATPS. The ATPS composed of n-propanol,NaCl and water was developed finally. Subsequently,the effects of pH,salt concentration,n-propanol volume and protein concentration on the ATPS' separation effectiveness for proteins were studied. Protein samples were prefractionated by the ATPS and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The results proved that the prefractionation method could separate proteomic proteins into three groups by one-step extraction,and there was no need for separating target proteins from the phase-forming reagents prior to gel electrophoresis analysis. Simplicity,rapidity and low cost are the highlight attractiveness of the prefractionation method. It also has advantages of biocompability,potential for continuous operation,no requirement for sophisticated instrumentations and being easy or no need for separating the target proteins from phase-forming reagents prior to electrophoresis analysis. The prefractionation method has great significance in proteomics and methodology.",

One in the input channel is generated by an exogenous system with uncertainty, which can represent the harmonic signals with modeling perturbations. The other is supposed to have the bounded H2 norm. The disturbance observers are proposed, which can be constructed separately from the controller design. A novel type of control scheme combined the disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) with discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC) is presented for a class of MIMO systems. By integrating DOBC with DSMC laws, the disturbances can be estimated and attenuated, simultaneously, the desired dynamic performances can be guaranteed. Simulations for a flight control system are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results compared with the previous schemes.",

Considering this challenge, this paper proposes a nonconvex power and rate management algorithm in cognitive radio networks. We apply an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to deal with this nonconvexity issue directly without any assumption, which is different from prior works. Since PSO sometimes converges around the local optimum solution in the early stage of the searching process, mutation is employed to PSO which can speed up convergence and escape local optimum. We also give the numerical results, which show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher quality solutions than other population-based optimization techniques.",

By constructing the ISS-Lyapunov function with the method of linear matrix inequality (LMIs), the \u201cquasi-min-max\u201d optimization problems are converted into finite time convex programming problems. Then the sufficient conditions for the existence of the dual-model robust state feedback predictive controllers are derived. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop uncertain singular systems is guaranteed by the designed controller. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to show the application and validity of the proposed method.",

Based on the bounded real lemma of singular systems, a sufficient condition for the existence of decentralized robust H-infinity and model predictive controller for uncertain singular large-scale systems is presented in terms of the solvability to a certain system of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the constructed Lyapunov function.

        "abstract": "On February 15,2006,the Chinese Ministry of Finance released a basic standard and 38 specific standards.Since then,the Chinese accounting standards have made substantial convergence with International Accounting Standards.In the capital markets,there is information asymmetry between company management and investors as well as investors.Accounting standards are an institutional arrangement to reduce information asymmetry.The goal of international convergence of accounting standards is to provide accounting information users with high-quality accounting information,reduce information asymmetry,optimize the allocation of resources and enhance economic efficiency.The current research literature have analyzed the effect of international convergence of accounting standards on information asymmetry in the institutional environment with developed market economies and sound legal systems,but not analyzed whether international convergence of accounting standards can reduce information asymmetry in the emerging market economies.Ball,etc.(2000),Ball,etc.(2003),and He(2007) showed that the institutional environment will affect the implementation of accounting standards and the quality of accounting information.Because of the different institutional environment,the quality of accounting information of different countries or regions,even with the same accounting standards,will be significant difference.In order to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and to achieve international convergence of accounting standards,the emerging market economies,such as China and Russia,have adopted the International Accounting Standards.There is a big difference between the emerging and developed market economies in terms of economic,legal and political system,analyzing whether international convergence of accounting standards can reduce information asymmetry in the emerging market economies is a very important and interesting research question. In order to make economic decisions,investors evaluate financial position,operating results and cash flows of enterprises,and forecast the future development trend of enterprises by using the full disclosure of financial reports.Chinese new accounting standards have improved accounting recognition,measurement and reporting,and provided more useful information to investors and other users of accounting information.The financial reporting of listed companies is an important way to solve the problem of information asymmetry between company management and investors as well as investors.By improving companies' financial reporting and information disclosure,can international convergence of Chinese accounting standards reduce information asymmetry between investors? Using A-share companies in China as samples and turnover as a proxy for information asymmetry,this paper analyzes the effect of international convergence of Chinese accounting standards on information asymmetry,and tests whether international convergence of Chinese accounting standards can reduce information asymmetry in emerging and transitional environment.The conclusions are as follows: After controlling the effect of bid-ask spreads,volatility of stock returns and firm size variables,the correlation of international convergence variable and turnover of A-share companies is significantly positive,and international convergence of Chinese accounting standards can reduce information asymmetry significantly.The above findings show that,in emerging and transitional environment,the international convergence of accounting standards can also reduce information asymmetry,thereby contributing to the effective functioning of capital markets.Research contributions of this paper are mainly reflected in the following two areas.On one hand,this paper enriches and improves the current research literature on international convergence of accounting standards and information asymmetry,and provides empirical evidence that international convergence of accounting standards can reduce information asymmetry in the emerging market economy.On the other hand,the conclusions of this paper provide policy recommendations for the international convergence of accounting standards and accounting supervision.",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that a high level of circulating heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) correlates with a lower risk of vascular disease; however, the biological significance of this inverse relationship has not been explored. Herein, we report that oxidative low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) and homocysteine (Hcy) induce HSP70 release from endothelial cells. In rat endothelial cells, Ox-LDL and Hcy induced robust release of HSP70, independent of the classical route of endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi protein trafficking or the formation of lipid rafts. In contrast, Ox-LDL and Hcy significantly enhanced the exosomal secretory rate and increased the HSP70 content of exosomes. Exogenous HSP70 had no impact on LPS-, Ox-LDL- and Hcy-induced activation of endothelial cells, whereas HSP70 did activate monocytes alone, resulting in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. These results indicate that exosome-dependent secretion of HSP70 from endothelial cells provides a novel paracrine mechanism to regulate vascular endothelial functional integrity.",

Mitochondria play a key role in regulating cell life. For exploring mitochondrial proteins which correlate with stress-induced injury, two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were applied. After comparing the protein profiles of myocardial mitochondria between a chronic restraint stress group and a control group, 11 protein spots were found altered, seven of which were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Among the seven proteins, five proteins involved in the Krebs cycle and lipid metabolism in mitochondria decreased after chronic restraint stress. They were identified as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase 1, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (NAD+) alpha, fumarate hydratase 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase beta. The last two proteins, creatine kinase and prohibitin, increased after chronic restraint stress. Biochemical tests for energy metabolism in mitochondria also supported the proteomic results. These findings provide clues for understanding the mechanism of dysfunction or injury in cardiomyocytes induced by chronic stress.",

Thedistance of wound scratch became shorter as the induction time of TNF-\u03b1 was increased.It was statistically significant from 12 h of TNF-\u03b1 induction(P < 0.05),and approached confluence at 48 h (P < 0.01).Moreover,the expression of UCH-Ll protein was also significantly increased from 12 h induction of TNF-\u03b1(10 ng/ml,P<0.05),thereafter it gradually continued to increase as the induction time prolonged.Conclusion TNF-\u03b1 dose and time-dependently induced VSMC migration,and UCH-L1 protein expression was increased in TNF-\u03b1-induced migtration of VSMC,indicating that UCH-L1 may play a regulatory role during the migration.",

The promoting effect of homocysteine (Hcy) on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation has been considered as one of the important pathological bases of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism of VSMC proliferation induced by Hcy remains unclear. The present research used proteomic techniques to globally analyze the protein changes in proliferative VSMCs. After comparing the protein expression profiles of VSMCs between the Hcy-treated and non-treated groups, 11 protein spots were found altered markedly in proliferative VSMCs with expression of eight protein spots increased and three protein spots decreased. In the differentially expressed proteins, eight protein spots were identified successfully including glycolytic metabolism proteins: pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and aldose reductase (AR); cytoskeletal proteins: lamin C and vimentin; and three other proteins: calreticulin; similar to WDR1 protein and LIM and SH3 protein 1. The differentially expressed proteins were further validated by Western blot and confirmed by assay of enzymes' activities and ATP content. These results may provide some clues for comprehensively understanding the mechanism of VSMC proliferation and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis induced by Hcy.",

        "abstract": "It has been previously reported that the plasma levels of autoantibodies against heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) are elevated in atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether anti-HSP70 antibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To determine this, we chose rats as an atherosclerosis model. Titers of plasma anti-HSP70 autoantibody were determined by ELISA. After the intravenous administration of antibody into the tail, the damaged areas of aorta were stained with Evans Blue, atheromatous plaque were stained by Oil Red O, and then they were measured and quantified with AxioVision computer software. The number of macrophages ([Formula: see text]), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and T cells were determined by immunocytochemistry. The level of anti-HSP70 IgG1 antibody was apparently increased in the AS group at the tenth week, and one hybridoma of HSP70 antibody (BD091, IgG1, recognizing C-terminal) had the same binding epitope as plasma anti-HSP70 autoantibodies. After intravenous administration, the lesion area of aorta with BD091 was significantly larger than those of IgG(mouse) and SPA-810. Moreover, injection of BD091 resulted in significant endothelium damage, followed by a greater accumulation of [Formula: see text], T cells, and SMCs in lesions than in the control. In conclusion, BD091 reaction with HSP70 expressed on arterial endothelial cells inducing endothelium damage triggers the inflammatory response in the vessel wall that accelerates atherosclerosis in rats. BD091 shares the same binding epitope with HSP70 autoantibodies. These data indicated that a specific epitope of anti-HSP70 autoantibody participated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

In the present study, human S100A4 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3), successfully purified by diethylaminoethyl cellulose anion-exchange chromatography and identified by western blot analysis. Soluble S100A4 bioactivity was confirmed by Transwell migration and invasion assays in the human HeLa cell line. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated utilizing the standard hybridoma method and were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis. The antibody was then used to examine human gastric carcinoma specimens by immunohistochemistry. Recombinant S100A4 was functionally expressed in E. coli and promoted the migration and invasion of HeLa cells. Four hybridoma cell lines, which secreted mAbs specifically against human S100A4 protein, were obtained. One of the four mAbs, namely 2A12D10B2, recognized human S100A4 as indicated by immunohistochemical staining of human gastric carcinoma specimens and recombinant S100A4 was functionally expressed in E. coli. The mAbs of recombinant S100A4 were suitable for detecting S100A4 expression in human tissues and for investigating the subsequent clinical applications of the protein.",

        "abstract": "It has been confirmed that stress plays an important role in the induction and development of cardiovascular diseases, but its mechanism and molecular basis remain unknown. In the present study, a myocardial injury model induced by restraint stress was established in rat. To screen for the related proteins involved in stress-induced myocardial injury, proteomic techniques based on 2-DE and mass spectrometry were used. In our results, ten proteins were found to be altered. The expression of eight of these proteins was increased after restraint stress, including cardiac myosin heavy chain, dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, H(+)-transporting ATP synthase, albumin, and apolipoprotein A-I precursor. The expression of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) and mitochondrial aconitase was decreased. Most of the proteins were related to energy metabolism. Further research indicated that UCP3 may mediate the myocardial cell response induced by restraint stress.",

In order to express rat S100A4 functionally and identify its biological activity following purification, an S100A4 gene fragment was optimized and fully synthesized via overlapping polymerase chain reaction. The gene was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector, pBV220, with phage \u03bb PRPL promoters following confirmation by DNA sequencing. The pBV220-S100A4 plasmid was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1. Following temperature induction, rat S100A4 was overexpressed and the protein was observed to be located in the supernatant of the lysates, which was ~30-40% of the total protein within the host. The protein was isolated and purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. High purity protein (>98% purity) was obtained and in vitro western blot analysis identified that the recombinant S100A4 was able to bind to the antibody against wild-type S100A4. The bioactivity of the recombinant protein was detected via Transwell migration and invasion assays. The polyclonal antibody of rat S100A4 protein was prepared for rabbit immunization and exhibited similar efficacies when compared with commercial S100A4. Therefore, rat S100A4 was functionally expressed in E. coli; thus, the production of active recombinant S100A4 protein in E. coli may further aid with the investigation and application of S100A4.",

Methods Tail-suspended SD rat model was used to simulate weightlessness. The activity of LDH and CK-MB were determined with biochemical methods. High pressure liquid phase and radioimmunoassay were used to detect the concentration of catecholamine and glucocorticoid,respectively. ATP synthesis rate of mitochondria was measured with luciferin-luciferase luminescent technique. The opening of MPTP was measured by fluorescent probe fluid dialysis setting. Results After 2 weeks of tail suspension,Specific change,ST segment shift and T wave height of myocardial ischemia was detected by electrocardiogram. The activity of LDH and CK-MB in serum increased significantly (P<0.05) after 3 weeks of tail suspension. Two weeks of tail suspension later,catecholamine and glucocorticoid concentration in serum increased significantly (P<0.05). Three weeks of tail suspension later,ATP synthesis rate of myocardial mitochondria decreased significantly (P<0.05) and the opening of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (MPTP) emergened. Conclusion Increasing of catecholamine and glucocorticoid concentration in serum maybe is the important mechanism of myocardial damage induced by tail suspension. Disorder of mitochondrial energy metabolism is the important intracellular mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of myocardial injury, which is associated with cardiomyocyte death. Mitochondria play a key role in triggering the necrosis and apoptosis pathway of cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress. Although prohibitin (PHB) has been acknowledged as a mitochondrial chaperone, its functions in cardiomyocytes are poorly characterized. The present research was designed to investigate the cardioprotective role of PHB in mitochondria. Oxidative stress can increase the PHB content in mitochondria in a time-dependent manner. Overexpression of PHB in cultured cardiomyocytes by transfection of recombinant adenovirus vector containing PHB sense cDNA resulted in an increase of PHB in mitochondria. Compared with the non-transfection cardiomyocytes, PHB overexpression could protect the mitochondria from oxidative stress-induced injury. The mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway was consistently suppressed in PHB-overexpressed cardiomyocytes after hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) treatment, including a reduced change in mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and an inhibited release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasma. As a result, the oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was suppressed. These data indicated that PHB protected the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-induced damage, and that increasing PHB content in mitochondria constituted a new therapeutic target for myocardium injury.",

NGFI-B induces apoptosis in a number of cell lineages exposed to proapoptotic stimuli by directly targeting the mitochondria, inducing cytochrome c release. The present study was designed to determine the role of NGFI-B in cardiomyocytes of restraint-stressed rats. The NGFI-B content was increased in mitochondria and reduced in plasma as apoptosis increased. Analysis showed that NGFI-B induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis in restraint-stressed rats by mediating mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder. Several novel mitochondrial proteins, which correlate with NGFI-B, were reported in cardiomyocyte apoptosis of restraint-stressed rats. Five proteins associated with NGFI-B participate directly in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Studies of mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and ATP synthase activity strongly support the findings. These results provide significant information for comprehensively understanding the cellular mechanism of cardiovascular diseases.",

The effects of rotation speed, air inlet velocity, air inlet temperature, and air inlet humidity ratio on the total heat recovery performance are numerically\u00a0investigated, and performance comparisons between HTHH working conditions and other common working conditions are also carried out. The comparison results show that the EW performs better for total heat recovery under HTHH working conditions, with  e  total  improving by 6% compared to common working conditions. The reasons behind the discrepancies are revealed by analyzing the distributions of temperature and humidity in the EW.

The coupled simulation of convection and radiation is set up by a computational fluid dynamics(CFD) method. The simulations with different panel positions and different indoor heat sources are used to calculate the cooling capacity of the radiant panel and the indoor thermal environment. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The results show that when the indoor heat source temperature is low, the convective heat flux is the main influence factor of the cooling capacity and the radiant panel should be placed on the wall or on the ceiling. Otherwise, when the indoor heat source temperature is high, the radiation heat flux is the main factor and the radiant panel should be placed as near to the heat sources as possible. \u00a9 right.",

This paper focuses on the air-conditioning system in Terminal 3 in Xi'an Xianyang International Airport, the first airport terminal to adopt radiant cooling in China. In the large spaces of this airport terminal, a temperature and humidity independent control (THIC) system has been adopted instead of a conventional nozzle air supply method, which significantly reduces the energy consumption of the air supply. The radiant floor is the main mechanism for indoor temperature control, while a liquid desiccant outdoor air processor combined with displacement ventilation is responsible for humidity control. Ice storage is adopted to reduce operating costs, and the supplied chilled water temperature can be as low as 3 \u00b0C. This paper examines the performance of the THIC system in detail. The indoor environment is determined through measurements to be comfortable, and the on-site performances of key components in both the airport terminal and the cooling plant are investigated. The outdoor air processor supplies air of appropriate temperature and humidity ratio; two kinds of radiant floors are used for temperature control, both with measured cooling capacities of about 30-40 W/m2; and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of the cooling plant is 2.62. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a new type of three-stage liquid desiccant deep dehumidification processor, using lithium bromide. Three small-capacity heat pump cycles are involved in the processor, in which the cooling capacity from the evaporator is used to cool liquid desiccant, and exhaust heat from condenser is used to regenerate the desiccant. This deep dehumidification processor can dehumidify the outdoor humid air to rather dry state (lower than 5g/kg), even there is no available indoor exhaust air. Two groups of performance tests have been made. The first group of test data show the COP of the processor is 1.8 and the supplied air temperature and humidity ratio are 1.6-2.6\u00b0C and 2.6-3.0g/kg in the outdoor air condition of 28-31\u00b0C and 11-14g/kg. One solution pipeline link problem has been found during the first tests, which will lead to the mixture losses of hot and cold liquid desiccant. So some pipelines are modified to minimum the mixing losses and the second tests have been processed after the modification. For the new processor, the later test data show that in the outdoor air condition of 25-32\u00b0C and 18-21g/kg, the COP of the processor is 2.8 and the supplied air parameters are 3.2-4.0\u00b0C and 3.4-3.6g/kg. The mathematical model of the deep dehumidification processor is built and well validated by the tested results. The simulation result depicts that the pipeline link modification may improve the performance by about 20%.",

This paper focuses on the match properties of sensible heat transfer processes and coupled heat and mass transfer processes in an effort to understand the reasons for performance limitations in order to optimize system performance. Limited heat transfer capability and flow mismatching resulted in heat resistance of the sensible heat transfer process. Losses occurred during the heat and mass transfer processes due to limited transfer capability, flow mismatching, and parameter mismatching. Flow matching was achieved when the heat capacities of the fluids were identical, and parameter matching could only be reached along the saturation line in air-water systems or the iso-concentration line in air-desiccant systems. Analytical solutions of heat transfer resistance and mass transfer resistance were then derived. The heat and mass transfer process close to the saturation line is recommended, and heating sprayed water resulted in better humidification performance than heating inlet air in the air humidifier. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "In this paper, two typical types of radiant floors are examined: concrete core radiant floors and light radiant floors. Their variant dynamic behaviors during intermittent operation are illustrated, and the impact of transient solar radiation is determined through numerical calculation. The concept of the time constant is used to estimate quantitatively the thermal inertia of the different types of radiant floors, especially the response time in the start-up period of the cooling/heating systems. The response time of the concrete core radiant floor is estimated to be 1-3. h, and that of the light floor is estimated to be 10-20. min; these values are consistent with the actual cool-down/heat-up times. When exposed to solar radiation, the cooling capacity of the radiant floors is much higher compared to applications without solar radiation. To estimate the real-time floor surface temperature and cooling capacity with transient solar radiation for both design and operation, a simple calculation method based on thermal capacity of the radiant floor is introduced, and the results accord well with the numerical calculation results. And the dynamic equivalent heat resistance is defined to reflect the thermal behavior of radiant floor with transient solar radiation. In addition, the heat extraction by chilled water in the radiant floor is distinct from the heat absorbed at the floor surface due to the heat storage of the radiant floor, which is also estimated by simple calculation. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Heat pump driven liquid desiccant dehumidification (HPLD) devices, in which both the cooling capacity from an evaporator and heat from a condenser are utilized, have been developing rapidly in recent years. Because the amount of heat from the condenser is usually more than required for desiccant regeneration, the key to improve the performance of these systems involves effectively exhausting the extra heat. In this paper, two different methods for removing the extra heat are analyzed: adding an air-cooled assistant condenser in either the inlet or outlet of the regeneration air duct, and utilizing a water-cooled assistant condenser that uses cooled water from evaporation of the exhaust air. These handling processes were compared in terms of their HPLD performance under various operating conditions. Devices using an air-cooled or water-cooled assistant condenser showed better performance than a basic system without an assistant condenser. For systems with an air-cooled assistant condenser, the location of the condenser rarely affected the performance: COP sys was an average of about 18% higher than that of the basic system. The system with the water-cooled condenser performed the best out of all the investigated systems: COP sys was about 35% higher than that of the basic system. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because of this distinction, THIC air-conditioning systems can satisfy the adjustment requirements of indoor temperature and humidity better than conventional systems can, and they show significant potential for energy conservation. In the past ten years, rapid improvements have been achieved in both theoretical research and the development of equipment related to THIC systems, and more and more applications are being put into use in non-residential buildings in China. This paper focuses on the development of THIC systems in China and reviews recent achievements and progress related to the main devices used for temperature and humidity control, including outdoor air handling dehumidification processors, sensible heat terminals, and high-temperature cooling sources. The energy performance of THIC systems is examined based on an analysis of established applications. Both the performance of key components and the energy consumption of entire systems indicate that THIC systems result in significant improvements in energy performance compared to conventional systems. Developmental trends and recommendations about design methodology, ways to improve the performance of handling devices, and feedback from applications of THIC systems are also discussed. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Heat pump-driven liquid desiccant (HPLD) systems have become more and more popular because of their high energy efficiency, and there are many different ways to utilize the condensing heat in this type of air handling device. In the present study, the match properties of the heat and mass transfer processes in the air-desiccant system varying with the inlet air states are investigated, and the unmatched coefficient based on entransy dissipation is adopted to evaluate the performance of HPLD systems. It is demonstrated that the unmatched coefficient of the process along the iso-concentration line is much lower than that along the isenthalpic line. A higher unmatched coefficient means a higher heat or mass transfer resistance caused by the unmatched flow rates or parameters. The HPLD system in which solution is heated for regeneration (Basic Type II) performs much better than the system in which regeneration air is heated (Basic Type I). The unmatched coefficients of the condenser and regenerator decrease from 2.70 and 1.34, respectively, in Basic Type I, to 1.07 and 1.05, respectively, in Basic Type II. Moreover, COPsys is significantly improved, rising from 1.83 to 4.17. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the present study, the operating performance of an internally-cooled process was examined through both experimental tests and simulation analysis. An internally-cooled dehumidifier made of stainless steel was designed, and experimental results in different working conditions were analyzed using a lithium bromide (LiBr) aqueous solution. The moisture removal rate, dehumidifying efficiency, and volume mass transfer coefficient were adopted as indices to evaluate the performance. The effects of the inlet parameters on these performance indices were investigated. The predicted results by the numerical model agreed well with the experimental results. The validated model was then utilized to predict the performance of the entire internally-cooled/heated air handling system, in which low regeneration temperature could be realized.

        "abstract": "The temperature and humidity independent control (THIC) system, which controls indoor temperature and moisture separately, may be an attractive alternative to existing conventional HVAC systems for its prominent improvement on the overall system performance and utilization of low grade energy resources. In order to verify the effectiveness of THIC system, a pilot project has been implemented in an office building in Shenzhen, China. In the system, liquid desiccant fresh air handling units driven by heat pumps are utilized to remove the entire latent load of outdoor air supplied for the whole building, and chilled water at the temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C from chiller is pumped and distributed into dry fan coil units and radiant panels to control indoor temperature. This paper presents the results of field test of the system, which shows that the system can provide a comfortable indoor environment even in very hot and humid weather. The COP of the entire THIC system can reach 4.0. According to the energy usage data recorded from the year 2009, the energy consumption of the THIC system in the tested office building was 32.2 kWh/(m 2 yr), which demonstrates magnificent energy-saving potential compared with the conventional air-conditioning system (around 49 kWh/(m 2 yr)).

In most cases, sensible load of building covers the majority part of the whole cooling load while the latent load (moisture load) takes only a small part. However, as the required cooling source temperature of dehumidification is much lower than that of cooling, the chilled water temperature has to be reduced to meet the demand for condensation dehumidification. Moreover, the ratio of sensible load to latent load varies largely due to the changes of outdoor climate, number variance of indoor occupants, indoor equipments and lighting utilization mode and so on. Therefore, the indoor temperature and humidity, the two key parameters, can hardly be satisfied with condensation by the cooling coil only. In practice, the common reaction to the increased humidity is to reduce the set-point temperature and then re-condition the air after passing the cooling coil to the proper temperature, which results in a plenty of energy wastefulness [1] . To avoid the aforementioned problems, temperature and humidity independent control (THIC) air-conditioning system stands out as an appropriate pattern that temperature and humidity can be regulated independently with temperature control subsystem and humidity control subsystem respectively. Besides, the coil temperature for cooling in the temperature control subsystem can be considerably increased, e.g. from current 7 \u00b0C to 17 \u00b0C, so that improvement on the performance of chillers or even free cooling from ambient could be obtained. Many investigations have been carried out on the hybrid desiccant dehumidification and air-conditioning system [1\u20134] , which integrates liquid/solid desiccant units with a conventional cooling system to avoid excess cooling. Liquid desiccant units developed quickly in recent years, for its advantages of dehumidifying at a temperature higher than the air's dew-point to avoid reheat procedure in the system, and regenerating desiccant at a low temperature which can be driven by low-grade heat sources [5,6] . Many studies focusing on improving its performance with process optimization have been conducted in depth, such as Yadav [7] , DryKor Ltd. [8] , and Liu et al. [9] . Chen et al. [10] designed an independent dehumidification air-conditioning system with a hot water-driven liquid desiccant and a chiller that provides 18\u201321 \u00b0C chilled water for an office building in Beijing, which saved about 30% cooling cost compared with conventional system. The performance of a hybrid system tested by Ma et al. [11] was 44.5% higher than conventional vapor compression system at a latent load of 30% and this improving could be achieved by 73.8% at a 42% latent load. Besides, the specific research on the feasibility and performance of the hybrid system in hot and humid regions is promoted [12,13] . This paper will investigate the real operating performance of a THIC air-conditioning system operated in an office building located in Shenzhen, a modern metropolis in southern China of hot and humid climate. In this THIC system, the liquid desiccant fresh air handling units driven by heat pumps are employed to handle the outdoor air to remove the entire latent load and supply enough fresh air to the occupied spaces, and the high-temperature chiller that produces chilled water of 17.5 \u00b0C for the indoor terminal devices (radiant panels and dry fan coil units) is applied to control indoor temperature. The operating principle and performance test results of the THIC system will be shown in this paper, and suggestion for performance improvement will also be included. 2 Description of the THIC system in an office building The THIC system has been put into practice as a pilot project in an office building in Shenzhen, China. This system has been brought into operation in July 2008 and the basic information about the building and air-conditioning system goes as follows. 2.1 Basis information The 5-story office building, as shown in Fig. 1 , is located in Shenzhen, China, with total building area of 21,960 m 2 and the areas of 5940 m 2 , 5045 m 2 , 3876 m 2 , 3908 m 2 , 3191 m 2 for the 1st to 5th floor respectively. The main function of the 1st floor is restaurant, archive and carport, the 2nd to 4th floors are the office rooms, the 5th floor is the meeting room, and there is a vestibule vertically through up the 2nd to 4th floors in the north of the building. In the vestibule, curtain wall with ventilation shutters in the upper is applied on its north surface, as shown in Fig. 2 . The outdoor condition in Shenzhen is rather hot and humid all through the year as shown in Fig. 3 . The annual outdoor air relative humidity is about 80% and humidity ratio in summer is as high as 20 g/(kg dry air). The building requires cooling and dehumidification in a long period of time, and no heating and humidification requirement in winter. Therefore, how to handle the moisture efficiently is a key issue in such a subtropical area. 2.2 THIC air-conditioning system The THIC system serves from 1st to 4th floor with the net air-conditioning area of 13,180 m 2 (total area of 18,769 m 2 ), and the 5th floor is served by several stand-alone air conditioners so that is not within the scope of our discussion. The schematic of the THIC system is shown in Fig. 4 with the main devices\u2019 parameters listed in Table 1 . The right side of Fig. 4 is the humidity control subsystem, including 9 liquid desiccant fresh air handling units that supply adequate dry fresh air into the occupied spaces. As the volume of the supplied fresh air is proportional to the number of people, the pollutants, CO 2 and latent heat produced by human bodies can be removed by fresh air. The schematic of the fresh air processors using liquid desiccant is illustrated in Fig. 5 (a) , which is composed of a two-stage total heat recovery device and a two-stage air handling device coupled with refrigeration cycles. Lithium bromide (LiBr) aqueous solution is employed as liquid desiccant in these air processors. The total heat recovery device is used to recover the energy from indoor exhaust air (return air) to decrease the energy consumption in the fresh air handling process. And in the heat pump driven air handling device, the diluted solution from the dehumidification modules is heated by the exhaust heat from the condenser and concentrated in the regeneration modules, then the hot concentrated solution is cooled by passing through the heat exchanger and evaporator before it enters the dehumidification modules, and lastly used to remove moisture from the fresh air. To make it clear, the air-handling processes are displayed in the air psychrometric chart in Fig. 5 (b) where the fresh air first passes the total heat recovery device to recovery the energy from the indoor exhaust air, and then flows into the dehumidification modules to be further dehumidified and cooled before it is supplied into the occupied spaces. In general, the COP of the liquid desiccant fresh air units (total heat removed from the fresh air divided by the power consumption of the heat pumps and solution pumps) can be as high as 5.0 with the following three main reasons: (1) the cooling capacity of the indoor exhaust air is fully exploited to remove heat from the fresh air by the total heat recovery device; (2) both the cooling capacity from evaporator and exhaust heat from condenser are utilized to enhance the air handling processes; and (3) the efficiency of the heat pump is significantly raised since the required evaporating temperature in this liquid desiccant device is much higher than that in the conventional condensing dehumidification system. Besides, as indicated in Fig. 5 (b), the supplied air temperature is lower than the indoor air temperature, so the liquid desiccant system can remove some sensible load of the building as well as the entire latent load. The left side of Fig. 4 is the temperature control subsystem that takes up the rest sensible load to control indoor temperature, including a high-temperature chiller, cooling tower, cooling water pump, chilled water pump, and indoor terminal devices (radiant panels and dry fan coil units). The high-temperature chiller is a centrifugal chiller with the rated COP of 8.3 (designed condition: the inlet and outlet temperature of the chilled water and cooling water are 20.5 \u00b0C/17.5 \u00b0C and 30.0 \u00b0C/35.0 \u00b0C respectively), which is much higher than the conventional chiller operating at the chilled water temperature of 12 \u00b0C/7 \u00b0C. As for indoor terminal devices, as shown in Fig. 6 , fan coil units (FCUs) operating in \u2018dry condition\u2019 are set up in the restaurant, archive and office regions which serve about 81% of the entire cooling load of the temperature control subsystem, while radiant floor and radiant ceiling panels are applied in vestibule and some office rooms which serve the rest 19%. In the previous sections, the whole THIC system layout has been introduced briefly. Particularly, stratified air conditioning, a key design principle of large space, is selected in the air-conditioning design of the vestibule as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Specifically, in the occupied zone (the height within 2 m), chilled water with temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C is pumped and distributed into radiant floor for cooling, and the handled dry fresh air and indoor exhaust air are supplied and expelled in the bottom and in the middle of the space respectively, which forms a \u201cdry air layer\u201d to protect the cold floor surface from condensation; in the higher space that far from occupied zone, solar radiation that enters through glass curtain wall is absorbed by the ornamental decorations in the higher space, and the heat is then carried away by natural ventilation through the shutters directly. The temperature control subsystem and humidity control subsystem can be operated separately according to ambient condition and indoor requirement. \u2022 The two subsystems operate together at hot and humid outdoor climate; \u2022 Only the humidity control subsystem operates at cold but humid ambient condition; \u2022 Outdoor air is directly introduced into occupied spaces after filtering when outdoor air is dry enough, such as 11 g/kg. 3 Performance test of the THIC system 3.1 Indoor thermal environment Fig. 7 shows the tested results of indoor temperatures, humidity ratios and CO 2 concentrations with the outdoor temperature and relative humidity of 34.9 \u00b0C and 61% respectively. As indicated by the figure, the THIC system could provide a comfortable indoor environment with suitable thermal condition and good indoor air quality. Fig. 8 depicts the tested temperatures and humidity ratios along the vertical direction in the vestibule. In the occupied zone (the height within 2 m), the temperature and humidity ratio were about 26 \u00b0C and 12 g/kg respectively which meet human thermal comfort well. Both the temperature and humidity ratio increased fast along the vertical direction, which reached about 30 \u00b0C and 20 g/kg respectively at the height of 10 m. And the peak temperature at upper space (over 7 m) occurred at noon, due to the strong solar radiation and high ambient temperature. According to the test results, the THIC system applied in large space is effective on energy-saving, which only keeps the occupied zone in comfort condition and forms apparent stratification of indoor temperature and humidity ratio along the vertical direction. Moreover, the natural ventilation from the shutters contributed to remove the absorbed heat of decorations to outdoor environment. 3.2 Energy efficiency of the THIC system The field test of the energy efficiency of the THIC system was conducted both under the partial load condition and very hot and humid outdoor condition. The former one is on May 27th, 2009, with ambient temperature of 29.3 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 79% (absolute humidity 20.3 g/kg), and the latter one is on July 16th, 2009, with ambient temperature of 34.9 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 61% (absolute humidity 21.6 g/kg). The measurement was divided into two parts: humidity control subsystem and temperature control subsystem. 3.2.1 Energy efficiency of humidity control subsystem The performances of the liquid desiccant fresh air units were tested one by one on May 27th, 2009, according to the measured flow rates, air inlet and outlet parameters through the processor and input power of compressors, solution pumps and fans. The tested results of seven fresh air units are summarized in Table 2 ; the other two processors are neglected due to the difficult of installing the measuring sensors. The east side processor of the 2nd floor is a typical example for the fresh air unit, and its specific operation information is shown in Table 3 . The fresh air flow rate was 5059 m 3 /h, the outdoor air parameter was 29.3 \u00b0C and 20.3 g/kg, and the supply air parameter was 17.1 \u00b0C and 6.2 g/kg. So the cooling capacity ( Q air ), calculated by energy balance equation, was 82.6 kW. The input power of compressors and solution pumps ( P air ) inside the processor was 17.8 kW, and the input power of the supply air and exhaust air fans ( P fan ) was 2.2 kW. Therefore, the performance of the fresh air unit ( COP air ), the transport coefficient of fans ( TC fan ) and the performance of the entire humidity handling process ( COP hum ), as shown in Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) , are 4.7, 37.5 and 4.2 respectively. (1) C O P air = Q air P air (2) T C fan = Q air P fan (3) C O P hum = Q air P air + P fan As shown in Table 2 , the COP air of the tested seven fresh air units are in the range of 4.4\u20134.9, the TC fan of the fans are 35\u201340, and the COP hum of the entire humidity handling processes are 4.0\u20134.4. According to the test data of May 27th, 2009 and rated parameters of the fresh air units and fans, the calculated cooling capacity of the entire humidity control subsystem is 773.0 kW with total inside compressors and solution pumps input power of 166.9 kW and total fans input power of 20.0 kW, so the coefficient of performance of the humidity control subsystem ( COP HUM ), shown in Eq. (4) , is 4.1. (4) C O P HUM = \u2211 Q air \u2211 ( P air + P fan ) Similarly, on the basis of the test data of July 16th, 2009, the COP HUM under the design condition is 4.1, with the calculated cooling capacity of 915.0 kW, total inside compressors and solution pumps input power of 194.4 kW and total fans input power of 25.1 kW. 3.2.2 Energy efficiency of temperature control subsystem The performances of the chiller, cooling tower, cooling and chilled water pumps and indoor dry FCUs were measured, according to the measured flow rates, water inlet and outlet parameters through the chiller and input powers of above facilities. The tested results of each device are listed in Table 4 . According to the test data under the partial load condition (May 27th), the calculated cooling capacity of the temperature control subsystem ( Q CH ) is 446.1 kW with total input power of 120.8 kW, so the COP of the temperature control subsystem ( COP TEMP ), shown in Eq. (5) , is 3.7. As well, the COP TEMP under the very hot and humid condition (July 16th) is 4.1, with the calculated cooling capacity of 543.4 kW and total input power of 133.6 kW. (5) C O P TEMP = Q CH P CH + P CT + P CTP + P CWP + P FCU 3.2.3 Energy efficiency of the entire THIC system The entire load of the building is composed of the latent load and sensible load. The former is both the moisture introduced by fresh air and released by respiration and perspiration of occupants and indoor plants, and the latter is the caused by the ventilation, heat transfer, solar radiation, heat dissipation of devices and activity of occupants, etc., as illustrated in Fig. 9 . In the THIC system, processed outdoor air is used to remove the entire latent load and part of the sensible load, while cooling plant provides high temperature chilled water to remove the rest sensible load. By calculation, under the partial load condition, the humidity control subsystem removed 63% of entire cooling load with 61% environmental control energy consumption, and the temperature control subsystem removed the rest 37% load with the rest 39% energy consumption. Similar conclusion also can emerge from the test results in the very hot and humid outdoor condition. Calculated from the above tested data, the overall COP of the THIC system ( COP SYS ) under partial load and very hot and humid outdoor climate are 4.0 and 4.1 respectively, as shown in Eq. (6) . (6) C O P SYS = Q CH + \u2211 Q air ( P CH + P CT + P CTP + P CWP + P FCU ) + \u2211 ( P air + P fan ) Based on the test results of these two typical operating conditions, it is convinced that the THIC system in this office building has achieved a high efficiency with its total COP more than 4.0. For the conventional air-conditioning system, such as fan coil unit plus fresh air supply system or all air system, the measured average coefficient of performance of whole system is lower than 3.0 [14] . Therefore, there is a remarkable energy efficiency improvement of the THIC system comparing with the conventional system. 3.3 Energy consumption of the THIC system Energy consumption of the THIC system is measured by the power metering monitoring system. Fig. 10 shows the monthly power consumption of the system from 15th April, 2009 to 15th October, 2009 (apart from weekends and statutory holidays). The total energy consumption was 425 MWh during the air-conditioning season, and the humidity control subsystem occupied 61% of the total power consumption which was proportional to the ratio of cooling load that the humidity control subsystem took up. The energy consumption in unit building area and unit net air-conditioning area of the tested THIC system were 22.6 kWh/(m 2 yr) and 32.2 kWh/(m 2 yr) respectively. However, the average energy consumption levels of office building of the similar building envelope and occupant density during the same time in Shenzhen are around 42 kWh/(m 2 yr) and 49 kWh/(m 2 yr) respectively according to the investigated results by Zi [15] . Therefore, the THIC system in this office building achieves noticeable energy saving compared with the conventional air-conditioning system. The initial cost of THIC system is about 10\u201320% higher than conventional fan coil unit plus outdoor air process system, and the added cost can be recalled within about two years. 4 Discussion According to our knowledge, cooling air can be realized more easily than dehumidification by condensation, since the latter one requires lower temperature of cooling source than the former. However, the COP of the tested temperature control subsystem is lower than or equal to that of the humidity control subsystem in present THIC system. Thus, this section will focus on how to improve the performance of the temperature control subsystem. According to the performance of each component in the temperature control subsystem shown in Table 4 , three main improvements of the temperature control subsystem are recommended: (1) modifying the frequency of the chilled water pump; (2) improving the cooling tower performance by tightening the strap; and (3) improving the performance of FCUs under dry working condition. The first two methods can be easily realized in the building, while the third one depends on the improvement of new FCU products. 4.1 Improve the performance of chilled water pump As indicated in Fig. 9 (b) and Table 4 , the power consumption of the chilled water pump was near 60% of the chiller. It is because the variable-speed pump has operated at 50 Hz in the past that the chiller temperature difference of the inlet and outlet chilled water is only 1.6\u20131.8 \u00b0C, while the designed value is 3.0 \u00b0C. Therefore, the power consumption of the chilled water pump can be considerably cut down after reducing the chilled water flow rate by frequency regulation. For instance, the energy savings of the chilled water pump could be up to 40%, if the transport coefficient of chilled water pump ( TC CWP ) is increased from the current 14.6\u201318.5 to the empirical value of 25. 4.2 Improve the performance of cooling tower According to Table 4 , the transport efficient of cooling tower ( TC CT ) was near 140, which was lower than the empirical index of 200. Detailed performance test is then launched. For the cooling tower, the mass flow rate ratio of air to water was 0.55, with air flow rate of 99,620 kg/h and water flow rate of 180,000 kg/h, and the temperatures of inlet water, outlet water and outdoor air wet bulb were 35.6 \u00b0C, 32.9 \u00b0C and 28.3 \u00b0C respectively. Hence, the efficiency of the cooling tower (the temperature variance of the cooling water divided by the possible maximal temperature variance) was (35.6 \u2212 32.9)/(35.6 \u2212 28.3) = 37%. By field survey, the low air flow rate, which led to low efficiency of the cooling tower, was caused by the loose strap of fan. The energy consumption of the cooling tower in the entire air-conditioning system is relatively small, but it seriously influences the chiller performance by affecting the condensing temperature. The expected efficiency of the cooling tower can be higher than 55% if the air flow rate increases to about 180,000 kg/h, and thus the condensing temperature can decrease at least 2 \u00b0C. As a result, the COP of the chiller ( COP CH ) can be increased from current 8.5 to 9.3. 4.3 Improve the performance of FCU As the chilled water inlet temperature is higher than the indoor dew point temperature in this THIC system, fan coil units that operate under dry working condition are put into use in this building to remove large part of the sensible load of the building. At present, the configuration of the adopted dry FCUs is similar to the originally wet FCUs (with standard chilled water inlet temperature of 7 \u00b0C and transport coefficient of 50). However, the tested transport coefficient of the dry FCUs ( TC FCU ) was around 20, as shown in Table 4 . Factually, the configuration of dry FCUs should be rather different from wet FCUs, since condensing water no longer exists in dry FCUs, and some dry FCUs with new configuration have appeared with TC FCU close to 50. So there is a huge potential to improve the performance of dry FCU with the transport coefficient increased to around 40. The contribution of the above three improvements to the temperature control subsystem is summarized in Table 5 . And the expected COP TEMP and COP SYS can be increased to 4.8 and 4.4 respectively after these alterations. Therefore, the energy consumption of the altered temperature control subsystem can save 23% compared to present situation, and the entire THIC system can save 9% compared to its performance at present. 5 Conclusion The operating performance of the THIC system in an office building in Shenzhen is presented in this paper. Liquid desiccant fresh air units are used to supply dry fresh air to control indoor humidity, and chilled water with the temperature of 17.5 \u00b0C is pumped and distributed into radiant panels and dry fan coil units to control indoor temperature. The followings are the conclusions based on the tested results: (1) The THIC system can provide a comfortable indoor environment that indoor temperatures, humidity ratios as well as CO 2 concentrations are all within the comfortable ranges. (2) The COP of the entire THIC system can reach 4.0, with the COP of the temperature control subsystem and humidity control subsystem of 3.7\u20134.1 and 4.1 respectively. The energy consumption of the THIC system in the tested office building is 32.2 kWh/(m 2 yr) (net air-conditioning area), that is, the energy efficiency is much higher than that of the conventional air-conditioning system available in literature. (3) Possible improvements of the temperature control subsystem are provided, including modification on the chilled water pump, cooling tower and FCUs. Thus, the expected system COP can be further increased to 4.4, which can save 9% compared to present air-conditioning system.

        "abstract": "Radiant floor cooling is suitable for environmental control in large space buildings with high-intensity solar radiation caused by a large transparent envelope. A simple method for predicting the performance of radiant floor cooling systems with solar radiation in steady state is proposed in this paper, and the key factors that influence performance are obtained. Cooling capacity of the radiant floor is significantly increased with high-intensity solar radiation and high-temperature building envelope surfaces in large space buildings. The effect of shelter of indoor furniture (such as chairs) on the performance of radiant floors is analyzed. The lowest floor surface temperature is located at the sheltered floor, and the cooling capacity of the sheltered radiant floor is also lower than that of the unsheltered radiant floor. A case study applying radiant floor cooling in a large space building is then analyzed, and the results are compared with those of a conventional all-air jet ventilation system. At the same indoor air temperature, the radiant cooling system can provide better thermal comfort at a lower operative temperature, and it presents a significant improvement in energy efficiency, with total energy demand 20-30% lower than the conventional all-air system. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, detailed quantitative comparisons of three typical types of internally-cooled dehumidifiers with different structures (parallel plate, fin coil, and packed tower with cooling tubes) were performed. The heat and mass transfer coefficients and the specific surface areas of the different types of devices were compared and a heat and mass transfer model of an internally-cooled dehumidifier was adopted to analyze the performance of different devices. The results showed that internally-cooled dehumidifier with the fin-coil structure demonstrated superior performance compared to the other two systems; the packed tower with cooling tubes displayed the poorest performance among the three devices. In addition, the effects of the heat transfer ability between the desiccant and cooling water and the mass transfer ability between the desiccant and air on dehumidification performance were investigated. Results showed that the main reason for the difference in performance is that mass transfer ability influenced current device performance to the greatest degree. Thus, to further improve the devices, greater attention should be paid to the mass transfer process between the air and desiccant.",

This kind of enthalpy recovery device with a cross-flow pattern is investigated in the present study and its simulation model is built. Exergy analysis is utilized as the theoretical tool for optimizing the handling process. Reasons leading to exergy destruction are clarified. In addition to solution mixing process, limited transfer ability and unmatched coefficient are two main factors accounting for exergy destruction. Recovery efficiencies varying with mass flow ratio between air and solution are analyzed and the optimal flow ratio is obtained. A multi-stage device is proposed as an improvement to reduce the negative influence due to the unmatched coefficient and solution mixing process. Both recovery efficiencies  \u03b7 h   ( \u03b7 m  ) and exergy efficiency  \u03b7 ex   improve with the increase of stage number, while exergy destruction caused by unmatched coefficient or solution mixing process decreases. The multi-stage process also helps to reduce the required  NTU  for a certain recovery efficiency. Efficiency of a 3-stage or 4-stage device is quite close to that with infinite stages.

This article focuses on the performance of air-dehumidification systems using liquid desiccant and a desiccant wheel. Based on basic air-handling processes using desiccants, the characteristics of the driving forces are investigated with the help of an unmatched coefficient \u03be and exergy analysis. The performace of liquid desiccant and desiccant wheel systems is investigated, and approaches for improvement are proposed. It is indicated that the temperature difference \u0394T or humidity ratio difference \u0394\u03c9 in the liquid desiccant process is influenced by the inlet state of the air and solution. The liquid desiccant process heating solution, rather than air, for regeneration is optimal from the perspective of lowering \u03be and reducing unmatched destruction. The \u03be is approaching 1 between air and solid desiccant, i.e., the driving force is relatively uniform with the same dehumid...",

Increasing attention has been paid to heat pump driven liquid desiccant (HPLD) systems in China. The current research focuses on a counter-flow HPLD system. The configuration of this HPLD system is introduced and theoretical models of key components are analyzed. Based on the simulation model, operating performances with varying input parameters are obtained. Effects of input NTUm, NTUevap and required \u03c9sa are drawn from the simulated results. NTUm of the packed tower is a key parameter, which affects Qfa/Qe indicating the heat recovery performance and COPhp indicating the energy performance of heat pump. As NTUm is not sufficient, heat-cold offset resulted from solutions circulating between dehumidifier and regenerator severely affects the system performance. Then adding a solution heat exchanger is regarded as an appropriate approach to improve the performance. Besides, adopting a multi-stage heat pump cycle helps to improve the match properties between solution and refrigerant. Itu0027s treated as an approach to improve the energy efficiency of this counter-flow HPLD system to a certain extent.

Moisture removal rate, exergy efficiency and unmatched coefficient are adopted, to analyze performance of ICDs under different flow types. Sensitivity analysis of each operating parameters as well as their influence on the performance difference among different flow types were carried out. Finally, the design suggestion on choosing flow types for ICD was given. It was found that counter flow arrangement between air and cooling media has shown higher moisture removal rate and lower exergy destruction among all flow types. It was proved that more evenly distributed heat and mass transfer driving force can help decrease the device exergy destruction as well as improving the overall device performance. Thus, the performance of ICD can be improved by decreasing the desiccant solution mass flow rate, lowering the desiccant solution inlet temperature. As for further dehumidifier design, flow type with counter flow between air and cooling media and cross flow between air and desiccant solution is recommended.",

A heat pump driven internally cooled desiccant dehumidification system is investigated in this paper. Dehumidifier and regenerator are both internally cooled/heated types compared to previous adiabatic ones, and heating and cooling capacities of a heat pump cycle are utilized for regeneration and dehumidification respectively. System model is established and validated to investigate system performance and effects of different influencing parameters. Itu0027s indicated that two main issues, which are restricting the system performance, are encountered, i.e. mismatching property among the three fluids inside the dehumidifier/regenerator and heat offset due to solutions circulating between dehumidifier and regenerator. Heat transfer mismatching ratio ( x   t  ) and mass transfer mismatching ratio ( x   \u03c9  ) are defined to indicate the degree of mismatching property. A lower solution flow rate and a solution-solution heat exchanger with a better recovery efficiency are highly recommended to obtain a better system performance. Further, an improved system with external pre-cooler and pre-heater was proposed to improve the matching property among the three fluids, and  COP   sys   is found to be increased from 5.96 to 6.68 with an increasing ratio of 12%.  x   t   is found to be reduced from 0.357 to 0.168, and  x   \u03c9   from 0.282 to 0.127.",

It is found that the adoption of a multi-stage heat pump cycle can improve the system performance, and then experimental tests for the system performance of the HPLD system with a two-stage heat pump cycle are investigated in the present study. The effects of solution flow rate, air inlet parameters including outdoor air and indoor exhaust air, and supplementary water capacity for the system on the system performance are elucidated according to the experimental results. It is found that the solution flow rate could affect the heat recovery performance between outdoor air and indoor exhaust air, and the performance of the heat pump. Thus, there exists an optimal solution flow rate for this counter-flow HPLD system, and the coefficient of performance of the system ( COP sys  ) can be as high as 6.5 under the experimental condition. Besides, the increase of outdoor air inlet parameters and the decrease of indoor exhaust air inlet parameters with enough indoor exhaust air flow rate for the system have favorable effects on the system performance, due to the promotion to the heat recovery performance of the system. And more supplementary water capacity to remove the redundant heating capacity of the system would also improve the system performance mainly through lowering the condensing temperature. However, supplementary water capacity cannot be added too much for the system due to the dehumidification demand. Furthermore, the coefficient of performance of this counter-flow HPLD system is approximately 30% higher than that of a cross-flow HPLD system, handling more dehumidification demand.",

Based on the experiment results, the heat and mass transfer model of a packed tower was used to simulate and optimize the performance of this device. The maximum enthalpy efficiency and enthalpy transfer capacity were achieved when the optimal air velocity (1.9\u20132.1\u2009m/s in this study) maintained to be slightly below the air velocity at the loading point and the thermal capacity ratio of air to desiccant (m*) equaled to 1.

Compared with the typically adopted adiabatic dehumidifier, three fluids are used inside the dehumidifier: air, liquid desiccant, and the internal cooling medium. Herein, a simplified analytical solution for the heat and mass transfer model of an internally cooled dehumidifier is proposed and validated. The enthalpy efficiency and moisture efficiency of the dehumidifier are deduced from the analytical solutions and are adopted to evaluate the dehumidifier performance. The influences of different inlet, operating, and device parameters on the performance of the device are investigated using the analytical solution. We found that the enthalpy and moisture efficiencies are decided primarily by six dimensionless numbers, three indicating the inlet states of the fluids, one indicating the mass flow rate of air to desiccant, and two indicating the heat and mass transfer ability of the device.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The purpose of air-conditioning systems is to provide a suitable indoor environment with respect to temperature, humidity and fresh air. Liquid desiccant dehumidification constitutes an effective method for extracting moisture from humid air with less energy consumption. Current studies mainly focus on dehumidification system under certain heat and mass transfer ability (number of mass transfer units  NTU  m ). This paper will investigate  NTU  m  of counter-flow packing tower and its influence on system performance. An experiment including a counter-flow packing tower was conducted. When the height of tower was 0.7\u00a0m, the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was between 1\u20134\u00a0kg/(m 3 \u00b7s) and  NTU  m  presented a range between 0.9\u20131.4, when air flow rate changes from 1\u00a0kg/(m 2 \u00a0s) to 2.5\u00a0kg/(m 2 \u00a0s). When the height changed to 2.1\u00a0m, the  NTU  m  of the tower presented a variation from 3.3 to 4.3. Furthermore, a simulation model is developed, which is validated by experimental data and past research results. The influence of  NTU  m  on total circulation flow path is mainly caused by heat and cold offset and an  NTU  m  value approximately of 4 constitutes a suitable value of increasing heat and mass transfer ability. Comparing three typical flow paths, when  NTU  m  is lower than 3.5, inter-stage circulation presents improved performance in system COP. When  NTU  m  is large, total circulation is efficient. The system  COP  cross points of flow paths are caused by heat and cold offset and concentration difference of the solution circulation between the dehumidifier and the regenerator, which can be quantified by loss coefficient  e  and  \u03c7  respectively. The heat and mass transfer ability of the system should be considered in the designing process of flow path configuration to obtain an efficient performance for different range of  NTU  m .",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Liquid desiccant (LD) systems are an efficient method for humidity control. Moreover, LD systems also function to purify the air and remove volatile organic compounds such as formaldehyde. This study aims to analyze the performance of a LD system for formaldehyde removal from indoor air while simultaneously considering air dehumidification requirements. A theoretical model is proposed to predict the formaldehyde removal efficiency ( e  formaldehyde ) of the LD system with various flow mediums, such as an air-LiBr solution, air-LiCl solution, and air-CaCl 2  solution. Prior to assessing the LD system performance with the model, Henryu0027s law constants (HLCs) of formaldehyde in the three solutions are tested at the salt concentration range of 30\u201350\u00a0wt% and at the temperature range of 10\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on the results, the correlation equation of the HLCu0027s temperature dependence are given, and then adopted for the simulation model. The effects of the number of mass transfer units of formaldehyde ( NTU  mf ), formaldehyde concentration in the return air, solution flow rate, and airflow rate on system performance are investigated and compared with various flow mediums. The results indicate that  NTU  mf  is a key factor influencing the  e  formaldehyde . However, the  NTU  mf  do not influence the dehumidification performance of the LD system. Both the  e  formaldehyde  and dehumidification performance remain unchanged with the increase of formaldehyde concentration in the return air. Both the  e  formaldehyde  and dehumidification performances decreased when the solution flow rate increased, and they likewise decreased with increased airflow rates.",

High temperature cooling and low temperature heating is achieved by reducing temperature difference in heat trans er and energy transportation process. The losses in temperature difference can be classified into three types: by heat/moisture exchange; by energy transportation through air/water circulation; by indoor terminal that releases heat/cooling to indoor condit oned space. The air handling process of HVAC system and indoor terminals are the key factor of reducing temperature differen e.  Aiming at the losses in HVAC system, Annex 59, titled High Temperature Cooling u0026 Low Temperature Heating in Buildings, is a new international cooperative work under the framework of International Energy Agency (IEA) Energy in Buildings and Communities (EBC). This paper introduc s the background, scope, objective, structure and deliverables of Annex 59. Annex 59 will try to present a new perspective and a new concept to analyze HVAC system in buildings. The goal of the Annex is to build up new concept of analyzing HVAC system from the perspective of reducing mixture loss and transfer loss and th n apply it in high temperature cooling and low temperature heating system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, the size of droplets departing from the superhydrophobic surface and conventional aluminum alloy surfaces was studied experimentally. It showed that the coalescence-induced jumping condensate droplets departing from the superhydrophobic surface has a radius of below 300\u00a0 \u03bc m, and the radii of the gravity-induced falling droplets from conventional aluminum alloy surfaces range from 2000\u00a0 \u03bc m to 7000\u00a0 \u03bc m. During dropletsu0027 dripping from radiant ceiling to human skin, numerical simulation also indicated that the change of the droplet size is rather small and can be neglected. Furthermore, the human sensory threshold size for fallen droplets was found to be a radius of 325\u00a0 \u03bc m via a psychological experiment conducted with 30 volunteers. Therefore, these results revealed that the superhydrophobic surface can significantly reduce condensation risks of radiant cooling ceiling systems. This is because the radii of coalescence-induced fallen condensate droplets from superhydrophobic surfaces are below this threshold, whereas gravity-induced falling droplets from conventional radiant ceiling surfaces can be perceived with a probability of over 95%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, a mathematical model for predicting the departure duration of the first condensate droplet from a radiant ceiling surface was proposed on the basis of the condensation water mass. The simulation results indicate a dependence of condensation water mass on the apparent contact angle of the substrate, but almost in no relation with the surface temperature. The condensation water mass firstly increases with the increase of the apparent contact angle. It reaches a maximum weight of 522\u00a0g/m 2  at an apparent contact angle of 110\u00b0, and then decreases. A visualization experiment of condensation on a radiant ceiling panel with a conventional aluminum alloy surface was performed in a climate chamber to measure the departure duration of the droplet. The measured departure duration fluctuates due to the variance of apparent contact angle and the randomness of condensation process, but it decreases sharply with the sub-cooled degree (air dew point minus surface temperature). And the average departure duration is 10\u00a0h with a sub-cooled degree of 5\u00a0\u00b0C. The theoretical model is validated as the average relative biases between the experimental and theoretical results are within 25%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Improving the energy performance of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is a key issue for building energy conversation. IEA (International Energy Agency) EBC (Energy in Buildings and Communities) Annex 59 presents a new perspective and a new concept to analyze the HVAC system in buildings. The project is organized following the idea of reducing mixing loss and transfer loss, and the work subtasks are arranged in response to the current insufficiency or inadequateness of HVAC system. Temperature level and temperature difference \u0394 T  are emphasized in heating and cooling systems for buildings as well as heating/cooling capacity  Q . Four subtasks are organized under the framework of Annex 59 dealing with different aspects of high temperature cooling (HTC) and low temperature heating (LTH) systems. Subtask A focuses on the principles and methodology. Entransy dissipation \u0394 E n   and equivalent thermal resistance  R  are recommended as indexes to investigate the transfer characteristics of an air-conditioning system. The objective of subtask B is to propose suitable indoor terminals from the viewpoint of avoiding mixing loss in spaces. Subtask C focuses on outdoor air handling process, especially for treatment of moisture. Subtask D focuses on total system analysis including case studies, with an objective to design HTC and LTH system appropriately. The present analysis is beneficial to cast light on the Annex 59 project and propose novel approaches for performance optimization of air-conditioning systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, we propose a pulsed flow control of the radiant system with a fixed on-time to replace the storage water in pipes and a variable off-time to regulate the capacity. We developed a three-dimension numerical model to simulate the performance of the radiant heating and cooling system in the pulsed flow control method. Through numerical simulation on radiant systems with various thermal masses, the average supply and return water temperature difference and surface temperature non-uniformity were compared between the pulsed flow control and the variable flow rate control. The results demonstrate that the pulsed flow control achieves a comparable supply and return water temperature difference and pump energy consumption to the variable flow rate control. However, the pulsed flow control method saves the initial cost by substituting proportional valves by two-way position valves and has a higher controllability in part load. Furthermore, the pulsed flow control yields a smaller surface temperature non-uniformity than variable flow rate control, which is beneficial to reduce the condensation risk in cooling condition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We present a novel pulsed flow control method (PFM) using a two-position valve to regulate the capacity of radiant slab systems. Under PFM, the on-time duration of the valve is short (compared to all prior work, e.g. 4-minute), and fixed, while the off-time varies. We present a novel, open-source, finite difference model that assesses three-dimensional transient slab heat transfer, accounting for the transient heat storage of the pipe fluid. Sensitivity analysis results indicate the dominant factors influencing energy performance of the PFM are: on-time duration; pipe diameter; and spacing. We experimentally validated both the new control strategy and model in full-scale laboratory experiments. Compared with previous intermittent control strategies (with on-time durations over 30\u00a0min), at 50% part load the PFM reduces 27% required water flow rate and increases supply to return water temperature differential. Compared with the variable temperature control method, at 50% part load the PFM reduces 24% required water flow rate. The energy performance of PFM is comparable to that of a conventional variable flow rate control. However, it has more accurate capacity control, achieves a more uniform surface temperature distribution, and reduces initial investment by substituting two-position for modulating valves, thus showing promise for engineering applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The local and mobile incident sunlight from skylight and side windows shining on the floor surface increases the cooling capacity of the radiant floor cooling system. In this study, a novel method of homogenizing spatial solar radiation distribution over the entire radiant floor surface is proposed to the design of the radiant floor with a conventional circuit pattern of counter flow. A verified three-dimensional numerical radiant floor model is utilized to evaluate the deviation of the novel method in steady and transient states. The simulation results indicate that the relative error for local sunlight with a width over two pipe spacing is less than 1.0%. With a solar radiation intensity of 300\u202fW/m 2 , the deviation of the simulated floor surface heat flux via the novel method is less than 0.3\u202fW/m 2  for any sunlight size in steady states. Furthermore, under transient and mobile sunlight, the simulated water side and floor surface heat fluxes via the novel method agrees well with the 3D model. As a result, the homogenizing treatment significantly simplifies the dynamic analysis of radiant floor system under temporal and spatial solar radiation distribution with enough accuracy in engineering applications.",

The heat transf r process of radiant floor and air system are compared in this paper. During the cool ng process, radiant floor removes indoor heat not only by convection but also by radiation, while air system handles all the heat by circulating ai. It means that radiant floor can absorb the solar radiation directly. A case study comparing radiant floor and air system is analyzed, and the results show that with transient high-density solar radiation, radiant cooling system can enlarge the terminal cooling apacity more remarkably than air system. The adaptivity of radiant cooling system can help avoiding temperature fluctuations and prevent unnecessary indoor adjustment requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lhasa, at high altitudes, in the west of China, is in a cold region, but with an annual total solar radiation as much as 7.2GJ/m 2 . Conventional water solar collectors and water pipes have the risk of burst in the severe cold. In this paper, a building heating system combining solar air collector with thermally activated building system (TABS) is proposed in Lhasa, China. To analyze the performance of the solar heating system in intermittent operation, a numerical model was built using the finite difference method for TABS and the state-space method for the reference building in Lhasa. The systematic simulations show that the indoor air temperature could be maintained at 17-24\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0hours with the TABS in intermittent operation at an average outdoor air temperature of -3\u00a0\u00b0C. The air solar collector of an area of 1m 2  could undertake the heat load of a building area of 3-4 m 2  in Lhasa without any other heat source.",

        "abstract": "In large space buildings such as check-in halls and departure halls in airports, the envelope is dominated by glass fa\u00e7ades, skylights, and metal ceilings. A radiant floor is an effective sensible heat removal terminal due to its direct longwave radiant heat exchange with high-temperature wall surfaces and absorption of solar radiation. The emissivities of metal ceilings and many advanced materials (e.g., low-e coating) in large spaces range from 0.2 to 0.9, markedly different from that of traditional building materials (0.9\u20130.95), which affects the indoor longwave heat exchange. Moreover, the number of transient solar radiation incidents on the floor surface can vary tremendously, resulting in remarkable differences in cooling capacity of the radiant floor, e.g., from 30 to 40 W/m2 to more than 100 W/m2. In this paper, a new simple calculation method for longwave radiant heat exchange that considers emissivity is proposed, and the location and duration of transient solar radiation through skylights and side windows in large spaces are depicted quantitatively. Based on this new method, a typical case study is presented, in which the cooling capacity of a radiant floor in the large spaces of an airport is calculated. The case study also showcases designs of radiant floors in large spaces with different material emissivity and transient solar radiation values.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Air handling processors with structure packing are widely utilized in the air-conditioning system, in which coupled heat and mass transfer occurs between air and water/desiccant. As an additional benefit, the processor could remove particles at the same time. An experimental setup for a cross-flow packed processor was established to investigate the filtration efficiency, in which air-water and air-desiccant were chosen as flow media. Effects of air and water/desiccant parameters on the filtration performance were experimentally analyzed. The results show that for typical air-to-liquid flow rate ratio (\u22481), PM 5  arrestance efficiency of packed processor with water is 40%\u223c50% while that with LiBr solution is 20%\u223c30%. The filtration efficiency with LiBr solution is higher than that with water when splash effect of liquid is omitted.",

An aquatics center with double ETFE cushion structure is researched in this paper. On-site measurements are carried out to investigate the building thermal environment. Air temperature in the cavity increases along the vertical direction due to solar radiation and natural convection. It reaches up to 60 \u2103 near the roof in summer. As a result, indoor heat load is increased to a great extent. Natural ventilation with elevated ETFE cushions in the roof is treated as the most appropriate solution for improving the indoor thermal environment. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results show that setting 10-15 elevated ETFE cushions with air outlets will lead to a ventilation rate of about 600,000-800,000 m 3 /h. The inner surface temperature of the building envelope is significantly reduced with the help of natural ventilation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The occupants are one of the major factors influencing indoor environment and building energy consumption. As for airport terminal buildings, the passenger flow distinguishes them from other common public buildings. Thus, the relevant researches are of significant necessity, especially in the recent airport construction boom in China. This paper describes the field investigations of passenger flow in each public area (i.e., check-in hall, departure hall, arrival hall, baggage claim area, arrival passage and transfer hall) of a Chinese hub airport terminal in typical three months of three different seasons. The passengersu0027 dwell time and the total occupant number are two mainly surveyed parameters. The results show large differences in the characteristics of passenger flow between various areas in the terminal building. Furthermore, based on the surveyed dwell time distributions of passengers and the real-time data of passenger flow intensities, the total number of occupants in the check-in hall and the departure hall can be estimated separately. This prediction model will be useful both in design and operation processes of an airport terminal.",

This paper focuses on the operating performance of mechanically ventilated double ETFE cushion structure and indoor thermal environment in the National Aquatics Center of China, the largest building in the world utilizing the ETFE cushion structure as its building facade. Without mechanical ventilation in the cavity, the cavity air temperature reaches as high as 46\u201357\u202f\u00b0C with a solar irradiance ranging 300\u2013800\u202fW/m 2 . It results in a sensible load of 78\u2013238\u202fW/m 2  in the large space of the aquatics center without shading devices. Air temperature in the cavity could be decreased by 7.3\u201310.5\u202f\u00b0C by virtue of a mechanical ventilation with an air flow rate of 830,000\u202fm 3 /h. A total heat quantity ranging 2300\u20135800\u202fkW is evacuated in the cavity with a heat exhaust efficiency ranging from 9.62 to 26.98. The inner surface temperature of the building envelope is significantly decreased with the help of mechanically ventilated cavity integrated with shading devices. It contributes to a lower black globe temperature in the occupied zone and a lower indoor heat gain through longwave radiation and air convection. Furthermore, preliminary test results of natural ventilation in the double ETFE cushion structure reveal its feasibility and potential for energy conservation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Currently, many airport terminals are being newly built or retrofitted. They are often designed with large open spaces, and entrances are usually open due to the continuous flow of passengers, which results in severe air infiltration. This paper investigated air infiltration in a Chinese hub airport terminal during three typical seasons by on-site measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The air-velocity method with CFD simulation was acceptable for estimating air infiltration because of the relatively constant airflow driven dominantly by stack pressure in large spaces. However, the tracer gas method was found to be unsuitable due to small differences in concentration. The air change rate varied from 0.14 to 0.56 h \u22121 , in which the maximum value occurred in the winter daytime when space heating systems were in operation. Air infiltration caused 71% of the heat loss during the winter testing period, and 26% of the heat gain during summer. Furthermore, air infiltration in winter directly influenced thermal comfort in occupant zones (PMV\u202f=\u202f\u22122.58\u20130.55, with an average value of \u22121.2). Therefore, more attention should be focused on the research into air infiltration in large space buildings.",

This paper describes on-site measurements of indoor thermal environment and air infiltration of a hub airport in winter in southwest China. Air velocity measurements with air volume balance check and thermal balance check were applied to assess air infiltration rates in terminal buildings. In unsecured halls, air infiltration rates were 0.61 air change per hour (ACH) (6.6 m3/(h m2)) and 0.28 ACH (3.0 m3/(h m2)) when space heating was on and off, respectively; while in secured piers, those two air infiltration rates were 0.42 ACH (2.6 m3/(h m2)) and 0.24 ACH (1.5 m3/(h m2)). Air infiltration consumed 66\u201392% of heat supplied by space heating systems, showing that winter air infiltration significantly affects indoor thermal environment and energy consumption in terminal buildings where air flows out through the doors of service walkways and open skylights on the roof.

        "abstract": "Abstract   As the two-phase thermosyphon loop (TPTL) gets more extensive application in data centers, problems have been encountered. One of the most common problems is undesirable overheating or subcooling during the operation of the TPTL. The overheating or subcooling results from abnormal operating states. Herein, an experiment conducted on an R744-based TPTL is described. The TPTL experienced a prestart operating state, an oscillatory operating state, and a stable operating state successively as the heat transfer quantity increased. In the prestart operating state, no regular circulation was formed in the loop, and overheating was usually measured in the top part of the riser. In the oscillatory operating state, the mass flow rate, temperature, and pressure all exhibited periodical variation with an identical period. In the stable operating state, the TPTL functioned well until the heat transfer quantity exceeded the maximum heat transfer ability of the TPTL. The stable operating state was divided into the normal operating state and the overload operating state, and the normal operating state is the goal to strive for in practical application. In the experiment, at the same fill ratio of 100%, the reasonable heat load ranges for normal operating of the TPTL were 650\u20131400\u00a0W, 1400\u20133300\u00a0W, and 2000\u20135400\u00a0W for diameters of 6, 9, and 12\u00a0mm, respectively. Higher heat load demanded for larger diameter.",

        "abstract": "The two-phase thermosyphon loop (TPTL) is an efficient solution for use in air-conditioning systems in data centers. The typical TPTL system pattern in data centers is the multi-evaporator TPTL. When the heat generated from the evaporators varies, the TPTL will self-regulate according to its own rules. In the current study, an experiment on a double-evaporator R744-based TPTL was conducted. Uniform, non-uniform, and variable heating power conditions were investigated, and a theoretical analysis was performed. The experimental results show that the mass flow rate of the high-power evaporator is higher than that of the low-power evaporator, but the self-regulating ability of the TPTL is very limited. The mass flow rate ratio (Mmax/Mmin) was between 1 and 1.5, with the heating power ratio (Qmax/Qmin) changing from 1 to 3; even when Qmax/Qmin is as high as 15, Mmax/Mmin is only 1.67. If the heating power of the two evaporators is different, the operating conditions of the evaporators will be affected. Therefore, when a TPTL is designed, more attention should be paid to the load of each single evaporator and the load of the other evaporators in parallel. In practical applications, significant differences between the heat transfer loads of parallel evaporators should be avoided as much as possible.",

Firstly missions and characteristics of the air-conditioning system are analyzed with emphasis on heat or mass transfer process. It is found that reducing the temperature difference, i.e. reducing the entransy dissipation helps to improve the performance. Entransy dissipations and thermal resistances of typical transfer processes in the air-conditioning system are presented.

Exergy and entransy are two common thermological parameters taking the influences of both heating/cooling capacity  Q  and temperature grade  T  into account. In the present study, similarities and distinctions between exergy and entransy analyses are investigated. Exergy destruction and entransy dissipation for mixing process and heat transfer process are investigated, which could be expressed in (1  \u2212\u00a0 T  0 / T )\u00a0 \u2212\u00a0Q  diagram and  T\u00a0 \u2212\u00a0 Q  diagram respectively. Formulas of exergy destruction and entransy dissipation are deduced. Exergy and entransy analyses tend to be in accordance with each other in the common temperature range of the air-conditioning system. To identify the leading reasons restricting performance, exergy destruction or entransy dissipation can be divided into two parts: one that is limited heat transfer ability and the other arises from the unmatched properties (embodied in an unmatched coefficient  \u03be  higher than 1). It\u2019s helpful to improve performance of the air-conditioning system through reducing exergy destruction or entransy dissipation. It\u2019s concluded to choose different theoretical parameters in terms of different purposes: entransy is more appropriate for a transfer process while exergy is more recommended for the heat-work conversion process. The present analysis is beneficial to choose an appropriate theoretical tool for performance optimization in the air-conditioning system.",

        "abstract": "Normally, Lactobacillus brevis has two glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) genes; gadA and gadB. Using PCR, we cloned the gadA gene from L. brevis strain NCL912, a high yield strain for the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, despite using 61 different primer pairs, including degenerate primers from conserved regions, we were unable to use PCR to clone gadB from the NCL912 strain. Furthermore, we could not clone it by genomic walking over 3000 bp downstream of the aldo-keto reductase gene, a single-copy gene that is located 1003 bp upstream of gadB in L. brevis ATCC367. Altogether, the data suggest that L. brevis NCL912 does not contain a gadB gene. By genomic walking, we cloned regions upstream and downstream of the gadA gene to obtain a 4615 bp DNA fragment that included the complete gadA locus. The locus contained the GAD gene (gadA) and the glutamate:GABA antiporter gene (gadC), which appear to be transcribed in an operon (gadCA), and a transcriptional regulator (gadR) of gadCA. During whole fed-batch fermentation, the expression of gadR, gadC and gadA was synchronized and correlated well with GABA production. The gadA locus we cloned from NCL912 has reduced homology compared with gadA loci of other L. brevis strains, and these differences might explain the ability of NCL912 to produce higher levels of GABA in culture.",

        "abstract": "Current genome walking methods are cumbersome to perform and can result in non-specific products. Here, we demonstrate the use of partially overlapping primer-based PCR (POP-PCR), a direct genome walking technique for the isolation of unknown flanking regions. This method exploits the partially overlapping characteristic at the 3' ends of a set of POP primers (walking primers), which guarantees that the POP primer only anneals to the POP site of the preceding PCR product at relatively low temperatures. POP primer adaptation priming at the genomic DNA/POP site occurs only once due to one low-/reduced-stringency cycle in each nested PCR, resulting in the synthesis of a pool of single-stranded DNA molecules. Of this pool, the target single-stranded DNA is replicated to the double-stranded form bound by the specific primer and the POP primer in the subsequent high-stringency cycle due to the presence of the specific primer-binding site. The non-target single stranded DNA does not become double stranded due to the absence of a binding site for any of the primers. Therefore, the POP-PCR enriches target DNA while suppressing non-target products. We successfully used POP-PCR to retrieve flanking regions bordering the gadA locus in Lactobacillus brevis NCL912, malQ in Pichia pastoris GS115, the human aldolase A gene, and hyg in rice.",

The ultraviolet spectral scan was carried out for preliminary screening of bacterial strains with the capacity to biosynthesize CLA, and the absorption peak at 228-235 nm was used for assessing the possible production of CLA by bacteria. The capillary electrophoresis analysis was used as the follow-up confirmation to definitively conclude CLA production and the composition of CLA isomers. Linoleic acid at the concentration of 25 \u03bcg/mL, which showed little inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria, was used for initial screening of CLA-producing strains. The strains with the ability to produce specific CLA isomers can be selected quickly from a large number of bacteria by this high-throughput method.",

For odontogenic differentiation study in vitro, alkaline phosphatase activity quantification, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, scanning electron microscopy, von Kossa staining and calcium content quantification were carried out. While both \"DXM\" medium and \"BMP-7+DXM\" medium induced the DPSCs to odontoblast-like cells, the \"BMP-7+DXM\" medium had greater inducing capacity than the \"DXM\" medium. Consistent with the in vitro studies, the \"BMP-7+DXM\" group presented more extracellular matrix and hard tissue formation than the \"DXM\" group after 8 weeks of ectopic implantation in nude mice. Differentiation of DPSCs into odontoblast-like cells was identified by the positive immunohistochemical staining for dentin sialoprotein. In conclusion, odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs can be achieved on NF-PLLA scaffolds both in vitro and in vivo; the combination of BMP-7 and DXM induced the odontogenic differentiation more effectively than DXM alone. The NF-PLLA scaffold and the combined odontogenic inductive factors provide excellent environment for DPSCs to regenerate dental pulp and dentin.",

        "abstract": "Controlled differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) is necessary to their use as a cell source for tissue engineering or regeneration. To date, most studies have concentrated on chemical cues to direct ESC differentiation. However, during normal embryonic development, multiple factors beyond chemical cues play a role, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) in bone development. In this study, we use nanofibrous (NF) matrices to mimic the morphology of the ECM to examine the contribution of the ECM morphology to the differentiation of mouse ESC. After 12 h of differentiation culture, mouse ESC form protrusions interacting with NF matrices, while they appear not to interact with flat films. Immunofluorescence staining after 26 days of differentiation culture indicates a greater degree of differentiation for mouse ESC on NF matrices compared to flat films. Polymerase chain reaction results, also, show greater degree of osteogenic differentiation on NF matrices compared to flat films when osteogenic supplements are added to the culture. Overall, these results demonstrate that NF morphology contributes to the controlled differentiation of mouse ESC.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether NF-PLLA scaffolds are advantageous for the odontogenic differentiation and mineralization of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) over solid-walled (SW) PLLA scaffolds. The in vitro studies demonstrated that, compared with SW scaffolds, NF scaffolds enhanced attachment and proliferation as well as odontogenic differentiation of human DPSCs. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expression of odontogenic genes of human DPSCs were increased on NF scaffolds compared with that on SW scaffolds. In addition, more mineral deposition was observed on the NF scaffolds, as demonstrated by von Kossa staining, calcium content measurement and scanning electron microscopy. Consistent with the in vitro studies, NF scaffolds promoted odontogenic differentiation and hard tissue formation compared with SW scaffolds after 8 weeks of ectopic transplantation in nude mice, as confirmed by von Kossa staining, Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemical staining for dentin sialoprotein. In conclusion, NF-PLLA scaffolds enhanced the odontogenic differentiation of human DPSCs and mineralization both in vitro and in vivo, and are promising scaffolds for dentin regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Thin sheets of nanofibrous (NF) poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) matrix were fabricated using a novel phase separation method, mimicking the structure of natural collagen fibers. In this study, the cell morphology, cytoskeleton and adhesion structure, proliferation and differentiation were investigated on NF PLLA matrix using an osteoblast cell line model. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the MC3T3-E1 cells took a more rounded shape on NF matrix, with abundant interactions with nanofibers. There were no long dense stress fibers or typical focal adhesion structures formed on NF matrix. In consistence with the flat cell morphology and abundant focal adhesions, the cell proliferation was faster on flat PLLA films. With the addition of ascorbic acid (AA), cells were induced to differentiate both on NF matrix and flat films. Cells on NF matrix exhibited an enhanced osteoblast differentiation phenotype, with dramatically higher bone sialoprotein (BSP) gene expression (two orders of magnitude higher) and significantly higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. Strikingly, even without the addition of AA, thus no natural collagen fibers deposited into the matrix, the BSP gene expression was still highly up-regulated on NF matrix, showing a direct effect of PLLA nanofibers on BSP gene expression. Enhanced BSP gene expression was correlated with the down-regulation of the small GTPase RhoA activities. Inhibition of RhoA effector ROCK induced BSP gene expression of cells in AA-free medium on flat PLLA films. These results suggest that the nanofibers promote the differentiation of osteoblasts likely through RhoA-Rock signaling pathway.",

In this work, a processing technique has been developed to create 3D nanofibrous gelatin (NF-gelatin) scaffolds, which mimic both the physical architecture and the chemical composition of natural collagen. Gelatin matrices with nanofibrous architecture were first created by using a thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) technique. Macroporous NF-gelatin scaffolds were fabricated by combining the TIPS technique with a porogen-leaching process. The processing parameters were systematically investigated in relation to the fiber diameter, fiber length, surface area, porosity, pore size, interpore connectivity, pore wall architecture, and mechanical properties of the NF-gelatin scaffolds. The resulting NF-gelatin scaffolds possess high surface areas (>32 m(2)/g), high porosities (>96%), well-connected macropores, and nanofibrous pore wall structures. The technique advantageously controls macropore shape and size by paraffin spheres, interpore connectivity by assembly conditions (time and temperature of heat treatment), pore wall morphology by phase separation and post-treatment parameters, and mechanical properties by polymer concentration and crosslinking density. Compared to commercial gelatin foam (Gelfoam), the NF-gelatin scaffold showed much better dimensional stability in a tissue culture environment. The NF-gelatin scaffolds, therefore, are excellent scaffolds for tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "The utilization of 3D scaffolds and stem cells is a promising approach to solve the problem of bone and cartilage tissue shortage and to construct osteochondral (cartilage/bone composite) tissues. In this study, 3D highly porous nanofibrous (NF) poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds fabricated using a phase separation technique were seeded with multi-potent human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the constructs were induced along osteogenic and chondrogenic development routes in vitro. Histological analysis and calcium content quantification showed that NF scaffolds supported in vitro bone differentiation. SEM observation showed an altered shape for cells cultured on an NF matrix compared with those on smooth films. Consistent with the morphological change, the gene expression of early chondrogenic commitment marker Sox-9 was enhanced on the NF matrix. NF scaffolds were then used to support long-term in vitro 3D cartilaginous development. It was found that in the presence of TGF-beta1, cartilage tissue developed on PLLA NF scaffolds, with the cartilage-specific gene expressed, glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen accumulated, and typical cartilage morphology formed. These findings suggest that NF scaffolds can support both bone and cartilage development and are excellent candidate scaffolds for osteochondral defect repair.",

        "abstract": "Intermittent (pulsatile) administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is known to improve bone micro-architecture, mineral density and strength. Therefore, daily injection of PTH has been clinically used for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, this regimen of administration is not convenient and is not a favorable choice of patients. In this study, an implantable delivery system has been developed to achieve pulsatile release of PTH. A well-defined cylindrical device was first fabricated with a biodegradable polymer, poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), using a reverse solid-free form fabrication technique. Three-component polyanhydrides composed of sebacic acid, 1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) propane and poly(ethylene glycol) were synthesized and used as isolation layers. The polyanhydride isolation layers and PTH-loaded alginate layers were then stacked alternately within the delivery device. The gap between the stacked PTH-releasing core and the device frame was filled with PLLA to seal. Multi-pulse PTH release was achieved using the implantable device. The lag time between two adjacent pulses were modulated by the composition and the film thickness of the polyanhydride. The released PTH was demonstrated to be biologically active using an in vitro assay. Timed sequential release of multiple drugs has also been demonstrated. The implantable device holds promise for both systemic and local therapies.",

However, in order to be used for such applications, embryonic stem cells' differentiation must be controlled to only the desired lineages. In this study, we examine the effects of nanofibrous architecture and biochemical cues on the osteogenic differentiation of embryonic stem cells compared to the more traditional architecture without the nanofibrous features in two dimensions (thin matrix or flat films) and three dimensions (scaffolds) in vitro. After three weeks of culture the nanofibrous thin matrices were capable of supporting mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation markers in embryonic stem cells without osteogenic supplements, while solid films required osteogenic supplements and growth factors to achieve mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation markers. Nanofibrous scaffolds substantially enhanced mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation markers compared to solid-walled scaffolds, nanofibrous thin matrices or solid films. After 4 weeks of culture, nanofibrous scaffolds were found to contain 3 times more calcium and stronger osteocalcin stain throughout the scaffolds than the solid-walled scaffolds. Overall, the nanofibrous architecture enhanced the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of embryonic stem cells compared to the solid-walled architecture in both two and three-dimensional cultures.",

        "abstract": "It remains a challenge to synthesize functional materials that can develop advanced scaffolding architectures for tissue engineering. In this study, a series of biodegradable amphiphilic poly(hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate)-graft-poly(l-lactic acid) (PHAA-g-PLLA) copolymers have been synthesized and fabricated into nano-fibrous scaffolds. These copolymers can be further functionalized, are more hydrophilic, and have faster degradation rates than the PLLA homopolymer, which are advantageous for certain tissue engineering applications. First, PLLA-based macromonomers were prepared by using functional hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates (HAA) as initiators. The PHAA-g-PLLA copolymers were then synthesized using free radical copolymerization of PLLA-based macromonomers and HAA. Nano-fibrous architecture was created using a thermally induced phase separation technique from these functional PHAA-g-PLLA copolymers. The nano-fibrous structure mimics the architecture of natural collagen matrix at the nanometer scale. The effects of the macromonomer composition, copolymer composition, blending ratio, and solvent selection on nano-scale structures were studied. In general, the nano-fibrous structure was created when the amount of HAA in the macromonomer was low. By increasing the amount of HAA in the macromonomer, microspheres with nano-fibrous surfaces were obtained. Further increasing the amount of HAA led to the creation of microspheres with leaf-like surfaces. These PLLA-based materials had much faster degradation rates than the PLLA, and could be completely degraded from several weeks to a few months depending on their composition and molecular weight. Furthermore, the PHAA-g-PLLA copolymers possess functional hydroxyl groups, which can be used to couple with bioactive molecules to control cell-material interactions. Therefore, these biodegradable functional copolymers have the design flexibility to fabricate various biomimetic materials for tissue engineering applications.",

In 2-D culture, hESC on NF thin matrices were found to express collagen type 1, Runx2, and osteocalcin mRNA of higher levels than the hESC on the solid films after 1 week of culture and increased mineralization was observed on the NF matrices compared to the solid films after 3 weeks of culture. After 6 weeks of 3-D culture, the hESC on the NF scaffolds expressed significantly more osteocalcin mRNA compared to these on the SW scaffolds. The data indicates that the NF architecture enhances the osteogenic differentiation of the hESC compared to more traditional scaffolding architecture.",

In this study, nanofibrous gelatin/apatite (NF-gelatin/apatite) composite scaffolds have been fabricated to mimic both the physical architecture and chemical composition of natural bone ECM. A thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) technique was developed to prepare nanofibrous gelatin (NF-gelatin) matrix. The NF-gelatin matrix mimicked natural collagen fibers and had an average fiber diameter of about 150nm. By integrating the TIPS method with porogen leaching, three-dimensional NF-gelatin scaffolds with well-defined macropores were fabricated. In comparison to Gelfoam (a commercial gelatin foam) with similar pore size and porosity, the NF-gelatin scaffolds exhibited a much higher surface area and mechanical strength. The surface area and compressive modulus of NF-gelatin scaffolds were more than 700 times and 10 times higher than that of Gelfoam, respectively. The NF-gelatin scaffolds also showed excellent biocompatibility and mechanical stability. To further enhance pre-osteoblast cell differentiation as well as improving mechanical strength, bone-like apatite particles (<2microm) were incorporated onto the surface of NF-gelatin scaffolds via a simulated body fluid (SBF) incubation process. The NF-gelatin/apatite scaffolds 5 days after SBF treatment showed significantly higher mechanical strength than NF-gelatin scaffolds 5 days after SBF treatment. Furthermore, the incorporated apatite in the NF-gelatin/apatite composite scaffold enhanced the osteogenic differentiation. The expression of BSP and OCN in the osteoblast-(NF-gelatin/apatite composite) constructs was about 5 times and 2 times higher than in the osteoblast-(NF-gelatin) constructs 4 weeks after cell culture. The biomimetic NF-gelatin/apatite scaffolds are, therefore, excellent for bone tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Bone tissue engineering is a rapidly developing area. Engineering bone typically uses an artificial extracellular matrix (scaffold), osteoblasts or cells that can become osteoblasts, and regulating factors that promote cell attachment, differentiation, and mineralized bone formation. Among them, highly porous scaffolds play a critical role in cell seeding, proliferation, and new 3D-tissue formation. A variety of biodegradable polymer materials and scaffolding fabrication techniques for bone tissue engineering have been investigated over the past decade. This article reviews the polymer materials, scaffold design, and fabrication methods for bone tissue engineering. Advantages and limitations of these materials and methods are analyzed. Various architectural parameters of scaffolds important for bone tissue engineering (e.g. porosity, pore size, interconnectivity, and pore-wall microstructures) are discussed. Surface modification of scaffolds is also discussed based on the significant effect of surface chemistry on cells adhesion and function.",

        "abstract": "In addition to suitable pore architecture of a tissue-engineering scaffold, surface modification after scaffolding fabrication is often needed to enhance the interactions between cells and the synthetic material. In this study, a novel one-step process was developed to fabricate surface-modified nano-fibrous poly(L-lactic acid) (NF-PLLA) scaffolds. First, gelatin spheres with smooth surface were prepared by non-surfactant emulsification, solvent extraction, and freeze-drying. A three-dimensional NF-PLLA scaffold was then fabricated by using gelatin spheres as porogen. Gelatin molecules were entrapped onto the scaffold surface during the fabrication process. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis demonstrated the existence of gelatin molecules on the surface of the polymer scaffold. The amount of gelatin on the scaffold surface was controlled by the composition of the solvent mixture of gelatin solution. The compressive modulus of scaffold prepared with gelatin spheres was more than three times higher than that prepared with irregular gelatin particles of the same size range. The surface modification significantly improved initial cell adhesion and proliferation over a 2-week culture. SEM images indicated that cells spread on the gelatin-entrapped scaffolds in contrast to spherical or spindle morphology on the control 1 day after cell seeding. Furthermore, more matrix secretion was observed on the surface-modified scaffolds than on the control after 2 weeks of in vitro cultivation. In conclusion, this approach provides a simple one-step process to fabricate surface-modified collagen-like NF-PLLA scaffolds, which have improved cell adhesion and proliferation.",

        "abstract": "Surface properties of scaffolds play an important role in cell adhesion and growth. Biodegradable poly(alpha-hydroxy acids) have been widely used as scaffolding materials for tissue engineering; however, the lack of functional groups is a limitation. In this work, gelatin was successfully immobilized onto the surface of poly(alpha-hydroxy acids) films and porous scaffolds by a new entrapment process. The surface composition and properties were examined using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and contact angle measurements. Control over the amount of entrapped gelatin was achieved by varying the solvent composition, the duration of soaking, the concentration of gelatin in solution, and chemical crosslinking. The amount of entrapped gelatin increased with the ratio of dioxane/water in the solvent mixture used. Chemical crosslinking after physical entrapment considerably increased the amount of retained gelatin on the surface of poly(alpha-hydroxy acids). Osteoblasts were cultured on these films and scaffolds. The surface modification significantly improved cell attachment and proliferation. Cell numbers on the surface-modified films and scaffolds were significantly higher than those on controls 4 h and 1 day after cell seeding. The osteoblasts showed higher proliferation on surface-modified scaffolds than on the control during 4 weeks of in vitro cultivation. More collagen fibers and other cell secretions were deposited on the surface-modified scaffolds than on the control scaffolds. This novel surface treatment strategy provides a convenient and universal way to modify the surface properties of three-dimensional scaffolds and thus promote cell adhesion and proliferation for tissue engineering.",

In this paper, we propose an improved line-based face recognition and indexing algorithm that uses a set of selected rectilinear line segments of 2D face image views as the underlying image represe- ntation, together with a nearest-neighbor classifier as the line matching scheme. The algorithm achieves high generalization recognition rates for rotations both in and out of the plane and is robust to scaling and variant illumination.",

        "abstract": "This paper puts forward a solution for real-time color-imaged human face detection. The color face image in RGB space is first transformed into human face color models under r,g,b chrominance which can be used to differentiate skin pixels from non-skin pixels. The color image is then divided into grid units which are arranged as a rectangle, and the ratio of skin pixels to all pixels in the grid unit is computed and the grid unit is regarded as a skin unit the ratio of which is greater than a threshold. The adjoining skin units are concatenated. The resulting area is labeled as a candidate face if its shape is quasi-ellipse or quasi-rectangle complying with proper ratios. Otherwise the resulting area should be disregarded. Finally the gray image of face area is matched to the face template to discern the real face. This algorithm overcomes the influence of complex background upon face detection and obtains higher accuracy of detection. In particular, the time consumed by this algorithm is much less than the traditional template matching method. Under a resolution of 320*240 it can reach 10 frames per second and is suitable for real-time face detection system.",

After the facial features such as eyes, nose and mouth are detected in an image which contains a face, the rectangle area surrounding facial features is obtained. The pixels number of the rectangle area is large and the intensity values of these pixels are often treated as a feature vector. It is very important to drop the dimension of the vector for an effective recognition. Three means for dimensional reduction in the feature extraction field are often used, including average values of weighted intensity, wavelet transform and principle component analysis. The compact face feature vector is the eigenvector to be recognized. A face recognition method using ART2 is proposed in the paper.

By clustering method the whole database is divided into a number of sub-datasets. Data redundant technique and predefined threshold are applied to reassign clustering edge elements of into certain sub-datasets. Then the searching is only carried out in one or few sub-datasets,which greatly reduces the searching time. Experiment results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the searching range,thus effectively increasing the searching speed while ensuring similar retrieval accuracy as to search the whole database.",

Then, the searching algorithm, i.e. genetic algorithm, is used to locate target objects in images by finding out the exactly matched position.

Their performances are compared in two color spaces: RGB and YCbCr, together with another artificial space, namely RYCr. The experiments show that in many cases, multiple channels fusion can help to improve the performance compared to the best single channel. The Sum, Product and Weighted Sum rules are more robust than the Min and Max rules. The effectiveness of channels fusion is more remarkable in YCbCr than that in RGB and RYCr, which confirms that independent information may be more helpful than dependent ones, even when some of them are poor.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an incremental learning based color iris recognition method is proposed. The inner and outer boundaries of the iris are localized employing Canny edge detection method and Hough transform algorithm in the red channel and the blue channel respectively. This method exploits some fusion strategies to combine the matching scores between the test image and the templates of each class. The strategies used in this paper are min, max, sum, product and weighted sum. The experiments were carried out on UBIRIS v1.0. The experiments show that, in some scenarios that acquisition conditions change leading to possible decrease of performance, because of its characteristic of learning in practice, the incremental learning method can handle the problem effectively.",

        "abstract": "Twitter is one of the biggest platforms where massive instant messages (i.e. tweets) are published every day. Users tend to express their real feelings freely in Twitter, which makes it an ideal source for capturing the opinions towards various interesting topics, such as brands, products or celebrities, etc. Naturally, people may anticipate an approach to receiving the common sentiment tendency towards these topics directly rather than through reading the huge amount of tweets about them. On the other side, Hashtags, starting with a symbol \"#\" ahead of keywords or phrases, are widely used in tweets as coarse-grained topics. In this paper, instead of presenting the sentiment polarity of each tweet relevant to the topic, we focus our study on hashtag-level sentiment classification. This task aims to automatically generate the overall sentiment polarity for a given hashtag in a certain time period, which markedly differs from the conventional sentence-level and document-level sentiment analysis. Our investigation illustrates that three types of information is useful to address the task, including (1) sentiment polarity of tweets containing the hashtag; (2) hashtags co-occurrence relationship and (3) the literal meaning of hashtags. Consequently, in order to incorporate the first two types of information into a classification framework where hashtags can be classified collectively, we propose a novel graph model and investigate three approximate collective classification algorithms for inference. Going one step further, we show that the performance can be remarkably improved using an enhanced boosting classification setting in which we employ the literal meaning of hashtags as semi-supervised information. Experimental results on a real-life data set consisting of 29,195 tweets and 2,181 hashtags show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-of-the-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification.",

        "abstract": "The amount of labeled sentiment data in English is much larger than that in other languages. Such a disproportion arouse interest in cross-lingual sentiment classification, which aims to conduct sentiment classification in the target language (e.g. Chinese) using labeled data in the source language (e.g. English). Most existing work relies on machine translation engines to directly adapt labeled data from the source language to the target language. This approach suffers from the limited coverage of vocabulary in the machine translation results. In this paper, we propose a generative cross-lingual mixture model (CLMM) to leverage unlabeled bilingual parallel data. By fitting parameters to maximize the likelihood of the bilingual parallel data, the proposed model learns previously unseen sentiment words from the large bilingual parallel data and improves vocabulary coverage significantly. Experiments on multiple data sets show that CLMM is consistently effective in two settings: (1) labeled data in the target language are unavailable; and (2) labeled data in the target language are also available.",

This problem is difficult since both erroneous and correct sentences are diversified. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identifying erroneous sentences. We first mine labeled tree patterns and sequential patterns to characterize both erroneous and correct sentences. Then the discovered patterns are utilized in two ways to distinguish correct sentences from erroneous sentences: (1) the patterns are transformed into sentence features for existing classification models, e.g, SVM; (2) the patterns are used to build a rule-based classification model. Experimental results show that both techniques are promising while the second technique outperforms the first approach. Moreover, the classification model in the second proposal is easy to understand, and we can provide intuitive explanation for classification results.",

        "abstract": "Mining bilingual data (including bilingual sentences and terms) from the Web can benefit many NLP applications, such as machine translation and cross language information retrieval. In this paper, based on the observation that bilingual data in many web pages appear collectively following similar patterns, an adaptive pattern-based bilingual data mining method is proposed. Specifically, given a web page, the method contains four steps: 1) preprocessing: parse the web page into a DOM tree and segment the inner text of each node into snippets; 2) seed mining: identify potential translation pairs (seeds) using a word based alignment model which takes both translation and transliteration into consideration; 3) pattern learning: learn generalized patterns with the identified seeds; 4) pattern based mining: extract all bilingual data in the page using the learned patterns. Our experiments on Chinese web pages produced more than 7.5 million pairs of bilingual sentences and more than 5 million pairs of bilingual terms, both with over 80% accuracy.",

Sentiment analysis is generally understood as a task that requires a deep understanding of the sentence structure (e.g., word order and non-local dependency). To attack this problem without the sentence parsing, we propose a novel approach that decomposes a sentence into a series of sub-sequences. Sentence-level polarity is then determined by classifying within sub-sequences and by fusing the obtained sub-sequences polarities. Extensive evaluations are conducted on one benchmark dataset for sentence polarity detection. Experimental results show that the performance of our proposed method outperforms two baselines based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Regression (LR), respectively. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

It is built primarily by mining translation knowledge from billions of web pages - using the Internet to catch language in motion. Currently Engkoo is built for Chinese users who are learning English; however the technology itself is language independent and can be extended in the future. At a system level, Engkoo is an application platform that supports a multitude of NLP technologies such as cross language retrieval, alignment, sentence classification, and statistical machine translation. The data set that supports this system is primarily built from mining a massive set of bilingual terms and sentences from across the web. Specifically, web pages that contain both Chinese and English are discovered and analyzed for parallelism, extracted and formulated into clear term definitions and sample sentences. This approach allows us to build perhaps the world's largest lexicon linking both Chinese and English together - at the same time covering the most up-to-date terms as captured by the net.",

        "abstract": "Microblogging services, such as Twitter, have become popular channels for people to express their opinions towards a broad range of topics. Twitter generates a huge volume of instant messages (i.e. tweets) carrying users' sentiments and attitudes every minute, which both necessitates automatic opinion summarization and poses great challenges to the summarization system. In this paper, we study the problem of opinion summarization for entities, such as celebrities and brands, in Twitter. We propose an entity-centric topic-based opinion summarization framework, which aims to produce opinion summaries in accordance with topics and remarkably emphasizing the insight behind the opinions. To this end, we first mine topics from #hashtags, the human-annotated semantic tags in tweets. We integrate the #hashtags as weakly supervised information into topic modeling algorithms to obtain better interpretation and representation for calculating the similarity among them, and adopt Affinity Propagation algorithm to group #hashtags into coherent topics. Subsequently, we use templates generalized from paraphrasing to identify tweets with deep insights, which reveal reasons, express demands or reflect viewpoints. Afterwards, we develop a target (i.e. entity) dependent sentiment classification approach to identifying the opinion towards a given target (i.e. entity) of tweets. Finally, the opinion summary is generated through integrating information from dimensions of topic, opinion and insight, as well as other factors (e.g. topic relevancy, redundancy and language styles) in an unified optimization framework. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-life data set to evaluate the performance of individual opinion summarization modules as well as the quality of the produced summary. The promising experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms.",

We formalize the task as a learning problem on a bilingual word graph, in which the intra-language relations among the words in the same language and the inter-language relations among the words between different languages are properly represented. With the words in the English sentiment lexicon as seeds, we propose a bilingual word graph label propagation approach to induce sentiment polarities of the unlabeled words in the target language. Particularly, we show that both synonym and antonym word relations can be used to build the intra-language relation, and that the word alignment information derived from bilingual parallel sentences can be effectively leveraged to build the inter-language relation. The evaluation of Chinese sentiment lexicon learning shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in both precision and recall. Experiments conducted on the NTCIR data set further demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned sentiment lexicon in sentence-level sentiment classification.",

We propose a novel system to tackle this challenge, which leverages redundancy in tweets by conducting two-stage NER for multiple similar tweets. Particularly, it first pre-labels each tweet using a sequential labeler based on the linear Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model. Then it clusters tweets to put tweets with similar content into the same group. Finally, for each cluster it refines the labels of each tweet using an enhanced CRF model that incorporates the cluster level information, i.e., the labels of the current word and its neighboring words across all tweets in the cluster. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated dataset, and show that our method boosts the F1 of the baseline without collectively labeling from 75.4% to 82.5%.",

Multi-tweet summarization allows people to quickly grasp the essential meaning of a large number of tweets. It can also be used as a pre-processing component for information extraction tasks on tweets. The challenge of this task lies in computing a tweet's salience score with little information in a single tweet. We propose a graph-based multi-tweet summarization system that incorporates social network features, which make up for the information shortage in a tweet. Another distinguished feature of our system is that tweet readability and user diversity are considered. We evaluate our system on a manually annotated dataset, and show that our system outperforms the stateof- the-art baseline. We further evaluate our method in a real scenario of summarization of Twitter search results and demonstrate its effectiveness. \u00a9 2012 The COLING.",

However, it is often hard for users to quickly get information they are interested in from tweets, owing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as their noisy and informal nature. We present QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search platform to tackle this issue. Specifically, it exploits a series of natural language processing technologies, such as tweet normalization, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to extract useful information, i.e., named entities, events, opinions, etc., from a large volume of tweets. Then, non-noisy tweets, together with the mined information, are indexed, on top of which two brand new scenarios are enabled, i.e., categorized browsing and advanced search, allowing users to effectively access either the tweets or fine-grained information they are interested in.",

One main challenge of the task is the lack of annotated tweets, which is required to train a statistical model. We introduce self-training to SRL, leveraging abundant unlabeled tweets to alleviate its depending on annotated tweets. A novel strategy of tweet selection is presented, ensuring the chosen tweets are both correct and informative. More specifically, the correctness is estimated according to the labeling confidences and agreement of two Conditional Random Fields based labelers, which are trained on the randomly evenly spitted labeled data; while the informativeness is in proportion to the maximum distance between the tweet and the already selected tweets. We evaluate our method on a human annotated data set and show that bootstrapping improve a baseline by 3.4% Fl. Copyright \u00a9 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

The model equation was resolved by Laplace transform. In the sphere coordinates, the linear regressive model was adopted to obtain the estimation method of diffusion coefficient, clearance rate of drugs distribution in the brain ECS.The diffusion coefficient D and the clearance rate k were obtained as (2.73\u00b10.364)\u00d710(-4) mm(2)/s and (1.40\u00b10.206)\u00d710(-5) /s, respectively.The proposed method can accurately reflect the isotropic drug distribution in the brain ECS, and can serve as the foundation to further solve problems about the orthotropic distribution in the brain ECS.",

In this paper, the interaction of ibuprofen with bilayer lipid membrane was studied by UV\u2013vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy. UV\u2013vis spectroscopy data indicated directly that ibuprofen could interact with lipid vesicles. In electrochemical experiments, ibuprofen displayed a biphasic behavior on bilayer lipid membrane supported on a glassy carbon electrode. It could stabilize the lipid membrane in low concentration, while it induced defects formation, even removed off bilayer lipid membrane from the surface of the electrode with increasing concentration. The mechanism about the interaction between ibuprofen and supported bilayer lipid membrane was discussed.",

The experimental results suggest that \u03b2-LG\u2013DMPG interactions cause \u03b2-LG a structural reorganization of the secondary structure elements accompanied by an increase in \u03b1-helical content, and a loosening of the protein tertiary structure. The interaction forces between \u03b2-LG and DMPG are further evaluated by fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence spectral data show that conformational changes in the protein are driven by electrostatic interaction at first, then by hydrophobic interaction between a protein with a negative net charge and a negatively charged phospholipid.",

The experimental data, based on the voltammetric response of Ru(NH 3 ) 6 3+ associated with the oxidation of CPZ on the electrode, indicated that the interaction of CPZ with s-BLM was concentration and time dependant. The interaction between them could be divided into three stages by the concentration of CPZ: low, middle and high concentration. At the first stage, s-BLM was not affected by CPZ and the interaction was only a penetration of a small quantity of CPZ molecule into s-BLM. At the second stage, the defects formed in s-BLM due to the penetration of more CPZ molecule into s-BLM. At the last stage, a high CPZ:lipid ratio reached in s-BLM, resulting in the solubilization of s-BLM. The interaction time had different effect at three stages.",

The characterization results from X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed the preparation of pure tetragonal phase BaTiO3 nanocrystals. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum indicated that the as-synthesized BaTiO3 nanocrystals had a direct band gap of about 3.42 eV. The room temperature photoluminescence spectrum of the as-synthesized BaTiO3 nanocrystals upon laser excitation at 325 nm exhibited a strong and broad emission in the wavelength range of about 480-625 nm, which may be originated from the surface states and other crystal defects. The impedance spectroscopy disclosed that the electric resistance and electric capacity of the as-synthesized BaTiO 3 nanocrystals were 1.4\u00d7104 \u03a9 and 5.7\u00d710-7 F, respectively. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, fabrication and performance of a 256\u00d7256 bimaterial cantilever focal plane array (FPA) which is able to work in the three infrared (IR) atmospheric windows of 1~2.5\u03bcm, 3~5\u03bcm and 8~14\u03bcm simultaneously. The FPA employs a silicon-framed structure by selectively etching away the substrate with Deep Reactive Ion Etching technique, and a stacked layer of chromium and SiNx serves as the multi-band absorber. The images of short wavelength, middle wavelength and long wavelength infrared were captured successfully with the same FPA by combining the Chromium nano-film with silicon nitride as the multi-band IR absorber. The measured sensitivity of the FPA is 0.18\u03bcm/K.",

We report on the fabrication and performance of an optical readout based MEMS IR FPA based on the bimaterial microcantilever. For the IR images of objects obtained by these FPAs, processed by the fast Curvelet transform denoising and inpainting algorithm, the image quality is improved obviously. Great compute and analysis have been realized by using the discussed algorithm to the simulated data. The experimental results demonstrate, better RMSE and highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared with traditional methods can be obtained. At last we discuss the factors that determine the ultimate performance of the FPA. And we indicated that one of the unique advantages of the present approach is the scalability to larger imaging arrays.",

        "abstract": "As an important branch of infrared imaging technology, infrared target tracking and detection has a very important scientific value and a wide range of applications in both military and civilian areas. For the infrared image which is characterized by low SNR and serious disturbance of background noise, an innovative and effective target detection algorithm is proposed in this paper, according to the correlation of moving target frame-to-frame and the irrelevance of noise in sequential images based on OpenCV. Firstly, since the temporal differencing and background subtraction are very complementary, we use a combined detection method of frame difference and background subtraction which is based on adaptive background updating. Results indicate that it is simple and can extract the foreground moving target from the video sequence stably. For the background updating mechanism continuously updating each pixel, we can detect the infrared moving target more accurately. It paves the way for eventually realizing real-time infrared target detection and tracking, when transplanting the algorithms on OpenCV to the DSP platform. Afterwards, we use the optimal thresholding arithmetic to segment image. It transforms the gray images to black-white images in order to provide a better condition for the image sequences detection. Finally, according to the relevance of moving objects between different frames and mathematical morphology processing, we can eliminate noise, decrease the area, and smooth region boundaries. Experimental results proves that our algorithm precisely achieve the purpose of rapid detection of small infrared target. \u00a9 (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The essence of ACF calibration is to establish the relationship between ray angles and detector coordinates. Centroids computation is used to find correspondences between the rays of datum marks and detector pixels. Here, the point spread function of RHT is classified as circle of confusion (CoC), and the fitting of a CoC spot with 2D Gaussian profile to identify the centroid forms the basis of the centroid algorithm. Theoretical and experimental results of centroids computation demonstrate that the Gaussian fitting method has a less centroid shift or the shift grows at a slower pace when the quality of the image is reduced. In ACF tests, the optical instrumental alignments reach an overall accuracy of 0.1 pixel with the application of laser spot centroids tracking program. Locating the crystal at different positions, the feasibility and accuracy of ACF calibration are further validated to 10-10 rad root-mean-square error of the calibrations differences.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the imaging speed of the optomechanical focal plane array infrared imaging system can be significantly improved by changing the pressure in the vacuum chamber. The decrease in the thermal time constant is attributed to the additional thermal conductance caused by air. The response time will be greatly shortened to about 1/3 time in low vacuum (around \u223c10(2)\u2009\u2009Pa) compared with that in high vacuum. At a chamber pressure of 50 Pa, the \"trailing\" in the IR image of a moving hot iron is eliminated with negligible deterioration in the image quality. Moreover, infrared images on rapid occurrence events, such as ignition of an alcohol blast burner, lighting and fusion of a tungsten filament, are captured at a frame rate up to 200 Hz. The above results show that the proposed pressure-dependent performance provides a way to improve the system imaging speed and helps to slow down a dynamic event, which is of great value to the uncooled IR imaging systems in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Wavefront coding (WFC) is a prosperous technology for extending depth of field (DOF) in the incoherent imaging system. Digital recovery of the WFC technique is a classical ill-conditioned problem by removing the blurring effect and suppressing the noise. Traditional approaches relying on image heuristics suffer from high frequency noise amplification and processing artifacts. This paper investigates a general framework of neural networks for restoring images in WFC. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt for applying convolutional networks in WFC. The blur and additive noise are considered simultaneously. Two solutions respectively exploiting fully convolutional networks (FCN) and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) are presented. The FCN based on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error (MSE) in pixel space gets high PSNR. On the other side, the CGAN based on perceptual loss optimization criterion retrieves more textures. We conduct comparison experiments to demonstrate the performance at different noise levels from the training configuration. We also reveal the image quality on non-natural test target image and defocused situation. The results indicate that the proposed networks outperform traditional approaches for restoring high frequency details and suppressing noise effectively.",

As a measure of image surface irregularities, fractal dimension (FD) was calculated for edge extraction and surface complexity evaluation. The modified differential box-counting (DBC) method was adopted to calculate FD, specifically the window merge replication method was presented to achieve FD estimation with a relatively small scanning window. The subaperture region and interference fringe edge were extracted by using a two-step strategy of preprocessing and postprocessing. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and accuracy for edge extraction.

The onaxisdesign provides better control of the astigmatism in the test. We use an on-axis Hartmann test in reverse to measurethe aspheric optical mirrors. In the configuration, the LCD with a light pattern on the screen illuminates to the tested surface,and a 2\u03bcm-thick pellicle beam splitter is employed to obtain the coaxial light model. An optical flat with 1/20\u03bb surfaceprecision is used to calibrate the rays which pass through the external pinhole and image at the detector, and the data areprocessed to obtain the direction vectors of arbitrary reflected rays. The surface gradients are determined by the spatialequations of incident and reflected rays which have been calibrated. The shape of surface is finally reconstructed byZernike polynomial fitting. The experiments include measuring a 76.2mm off-axis parabolic mirror and a 76.2mmspherical mirror. The experimental results show coaxial reverse Hartmann test system may allow for accuratemeasurements with uncertainties in the micrometer range using cost-effective equipments.",

        "abstract": "A series of K3Y(VO4)2:Eu3+ phosphors were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The luminescence properties were characterized by means of photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, CIE chromaticity, and concentration quenching. The excitation spectrum exhibits a broad band centered at about 324 nm in the region from 215 to 375 nm corresponding to an overlap of the charge transfer transitions of VO4 3\u2212 and O2\u2212 \u2192 Eu3+. The present phosphors exhibit green and red colors due to the host emissions of host and Eu3+ ions. The intensity ratio of 5D0 \u2192 7F2 to 5D0 \u2192 7F1 is highly dependent on the Eu3+ ions concentration due to the structure change of host. Eu3+-doped K3Y(VO4)2 phosphors show tunable CIE color coordinates from green to red dependent on Eu3+ content and excitation wavelength. The ideal red and warm white lights have been obtained from the phosphors by appropriately adjusted excitation wavelength. The results indicate that K3Y(VO4)2:Eu3+ is potential phosphors for white light-emitting diodes applications and color display devices.",

        "abstract": "Eu3+ and Sm3+ activated double molybdates, KY 1-xLnx(MoO4)2 (Ln=Sm3+, Eu3+), were synthesized by a convenient solid-state method. The photoluminescence properties, energy transfer and concentration quenching were investigated in the excitation and emission spectra. The results exhibit that with Sm3+ and Eu3+ ions co-doped into the host, the excitations around 394 nm and 465 nm become broader and their intensities are prominently enhanced compared to that of the single Eu3+ doped sample. The effective energy transfer from Sm3+ to Eu3+ is found to exist for Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped KY(MoO 4)2 phosphors. Besides, with increasing Eu3+ doping concentration, the chromaticity coordinates of KY1-xLn x(MoO4)2 (Ln=Sm3+, Eu3+) approach to the NTSC standard values in a systematic way. The KY(MoO 4)2:Sm3+, Eu3+ phosphors may be potentially used as red phosphors for white light-emitting diodes. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A series of Dy 3+  or/and Eu 3+  doped Y 2 Mo 4 O 15  phosphors were successfully synthesized at a low temperature of 600\u00a0\u00b0C via solid state reaction. The as-prepared phosphors were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscope (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) excitation, emission spectra and PL decay curves. XRD results demonstrate that Y 2 Mo 4 O 15 : Dy 3+ , Eu 3+  has the monoclinic structure with the space group of p21/C(14). Under the excitation of ultraviolet (UV) or near-UV light, the Dy 3+  and Eu 3+  ions activated Y 2 Mo 4 O 15  phosphors exhibit their characteristic emissions in the blue, yellow and red regions. The emitting light color of the Y 2 Mo 4 O 15 : 0.08Dy 3+ ,  y Eu 3+  phosphors can be adjusted by varying the concentration ratio of Dy 3+  to Eu 3+  ions and a white light is achieved when the doping concentration of Eu 3+  is 5%. In addition, the energy transfer from Dy 3+  to Eu 3+  is also confirmed based on the luminescence spectra and decay curves.",

Their luminescence properties were investigated by photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra. The excitation spectrum shows a broad band centered at about 275 nm in the region from 200 to 370 nm, which is attributed to an overlap of the charge transfer transitions of O2\u2212 \u2192 V5+ and O2\u2212 \u2192 Eu3+. The phosphors exhibit the red emissions of Eu3+ and the emission intensity ratio of 5D0 \u2192 7F2 to 5D0 \u2192 7F1 is dependent on the Eu3+ concentration due to an environment change about Eu3+ ions. Concentration quenching occurs at 30 mol% in the phosphors and exchange interaction is its main mechanism. Ba2LaV3O11:Eu3+ displays tunable CIE color coordinates from yellow orange to red depended on Eu3+ content, which may have a potential application for illuminating and display devices.",

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, scanning electronic microscope (SEM) images, photoluminescence (PL) excitation, emission spectra and PL decay curves were measured to characterize the as-prepared phosphors. XRD patterns indicate that the phosphors present pure phase with the cubic double perovskite structure (space group  Fm- 3 m  (225)) and the SEM image displays the nanowire structure with a diameter ranged from dozens to hundreds nanometers. The excitation and emission spectra demonstrate that Ba 6 Gd 2- x  Eu  x  W 3 O 18  phosphors present an intense charge transfer band at around 323\u202fnm and a strong orange-red emission of Eu 3+  ( 5 D 0  \u2192  7 F 1  transition) at 593\u202fnm.

It is shown that under some assumptions, the stability equation can be obtained yielding from a group of homogeneous equations. The stability can be judged by the non-dimensional imaginary part of the resultant complex frequency eigenvalue. Further more, based on the analysis of the unsteady phenomenon caused by casing treatment, the function of casing treatment has been modeled by a wall impedance condition which is included in the stability model through the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the system. Finally, some experimental investigation and two numerical evaluation cases are conducted to validate this model and emphasis is placed on numerically studying the sensitivity of the setup of different boundary conditions on the stall inception of axial flow fan/compressors. A novel casing treatment which consists of a backchamber and a perforated plate is suggested, and it is noted that the open area ratio of the casing treatment is less than 10%, and is far smaller than conventional casing treatment with open area ratio of over 50%, which could result in stall margin improvement without obvious efficiency loss of fan/compressors.",

This model takes specific flow patterns and impeller geometry into account, which can be used to analyze the effect of blade design parameters on the stall limit of centrifugal compressors. In particular, the body force model and the solution of the stability eigenvalue equation are two important problems to be addressed in this frame. The spectral method and singular value decomposition are used to discrete stability equations to obtain the eigenvalues. By applying conservation laws, a perturbation-response form of the body force, specifically for centrifugal compressor, is also established to simulate blade behavior. Two different forms (the meridional model and the normal expansion model) are derived to make a comparison of grid independence and computation time. The capacity of these models is assessed against the experimental data of a NASA low-speed centrifugal compress...",

The initial disturbance with the most unstable mode is obtained by a stall inception eigenvalue approach. To validate this computational model, several unsteady inlet boundary conditions with different frequencies are used as initial perturbations for full-annulus unsteady simulations of a transonic compressor rotor flow. Results reveal that the disturbance with the frequency near the most unstable mode can stimulate the objective rotating stall behavior, whereas the disturbances with the frequencies further away from the former cannot. The flow mechanism of rotating stall in a typical stalled case is also analyzed. It is found that severe tip clearance spillage and backflow form the stall inception disturbance, accompanied by a typical spike-type precursor. Based on comparison and analysis for different si...",

An approach aimed at predicting the stall inception point is developed by integrating an improved blade force model and a new mathematical treatment method for steady flow. This approach takes both the concrete blade geometry and complicated base flow into consideration, which promises to provide a highly efficient assessment of the stall margin of a compressor in the design phase. Specifically, the relevant validation is conducted through a typical transonic axial-flow compressor, which shows that the predicted stall inception point agrees well with the experimental result. Furthermore, the compressor is also adopted as a prototype, from which a series of forward- and backward-swept rotors are modeled. Aerodynamic instabilities in the form of eigenvalues for each swept rotor, along with the throttling process, are predicted by solving the de...",

This stage can be seen as a centrifugal pump with multistage guide vanes in pump mode. Experimental and numerical approaches are adopted to contribute the understanding of the highly complex flow regime inner the test pump. In the experimental test, both dynamic pressure measurement and flow visualization techniques are adopted. A commercial code with detached eddy simulation (DES) model is used to compute the flow regime. The frequency analysis indicates that two unsteady flow patterns with a constant frequency occur in the hump instability region. The numerical and experimental unsteady flow fields are analysed to study the fluid-dynamical features of these unsteady patterns, in order to investigate the origin and reveal their contributions to the hump instability.",

        "title": "Pulp regeneration in a full-length human tooth root using a hierarchical nanofibrous microsphere system",
        "abstract": "While pulp regeneration using tissue engineering strategy has been explored for over a decade, successful regeneration of pulp tissues in a full-length human root with a one-end seal that truly simulates clinical endodontic treatment has not been achieved. To address this challenge, we designed and synthesized a unique hierarchical growth factor-loaded nanofibrous microsphere scaffolding system. In this system, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binds with heparin and is encapsulated in heparin-conjugated gelatin nanospheres, which are further immobilized in the nanofibers of an injectable poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) microsphere. This hierarchical microsphere system not only protects the VEGF from denaturation and degradation, but also provides excellent control of its sustained release. In addition, the nanofibrous PLLA microsphere integrates the extracellular matrix-mimicking architecture with a highly porous injectable form, efficiently accommodating dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and supporting their proliferation and pulp tissue formation. Our in vivo study showed the successful regeneration of pulp-like tissues that fulfilled the entire apical and middle thirds and reached the coronal third of the full-length root canal. In addition, a large number of blood vessels were regenerated throughout the canal. For the first time, our work demonstrates the success of pulp tissue regeneration in a full-length root canal, making it a significant step toward regenerative endodontics. Statement of Significance The regeneration of pulp tissues in a full-length tooth root canal has been one of the greatest challenges in the field of regenerative endodontics, and one of the biggest barriers for its clinical application. In this study, we developed a unique approach to tackle this challenge, and for the first time, we successfully regenerated living pulp tissues in a full-length root canal, making it a significant step toward regenerative endodontics. This study will make positive scientific impact and interest the broad and multidisciplinary readership in the dental biomaterials and craniofacial tissue engineering community.",

        "abstract": "Nanofibrous architecture presents unique biophysical cues to facilitate cellular responses and is considered an indispensable feature of a biomimetic three-dimensional (3D) scaffold and cell carrier. While electrospinning is a widely used method to prepare natural extracellular matrix-like nanofibers, it faces significant challenges to incorporate nanofibrous architecture into well-defined macroporous 3D scaffolds or injectable microspheres. Here we report a nonelectrospinning approach that is effective at generating nanofibers from a variety of synthetic and natural biodegradable polymers and integrating these nanofibers into (1) 3D scaffolds with constructive geometry and designed internal macropore structures; and (2) injectable microspheres. Our approach to generating polymer nanofibers is based on the control of polymer-solvent interaction parameter \u03c7. We obtained the \u03c7 and solvent composition phase diagrams of different temperatures according to the Flory-Huggins classic lattice model and the Hildebrand-Scott solubility parameter equation. A critical polymer-solvent interaction parameter \u03c7 was introduced as a criterion to predict phase separation and nanofiber formation. To test the effectiveness of our approach, a total of 15 widely used biodegradable polymers were selected and successfully fabricated into nanofibrous matrices. Furthermore, macroporous nanofibrous 3D scaffolds with complex architecture and nanofibrous injectable microspheres were generated from those biodegradable polymers by combining our method with other processes. Our approach is universally effective to fabricate nanofibrous matrices from any polymeric materials. This work, therefore, greatly expands our ability to design appropriate biomimetic 3D scaffolds and injectable cell carriers for advanced regenerative therapies.",

        "abstract": "Micropatterning is a widely used powerful tool to create highly ordered microstructures on material surfaces. However, due to technical limitations, the integration of micropatterned microstructures into bioinspired 3D scaffolds to successfully regenerate well-organized functional tissues is not achieved. In this work, a unique maskless micropatterning technology is reported to create 3D nanofibrous matrices with highly organized tubular architecture for tissue regeneration. This micropatterning method is a laser-guided, noncontact, high-precision, flexible computer programming of machining process that can create highly ordered tubules with the density ranged from 1000 to 60 000 mm and the size varied from 300 nm to 30 \u00b5m in the bioinspired 3D matrix. The tubular architecture presents pivotal biophysical cues to control dental pulp stem cell alignment, migration, polarization, and differentiation. More importantly, when using this 3D tubular hierarchical matrix as a scaffold, this study successfully regenerates functional tubular dentin that has the same well-organized microstructure as its natural counterpart. This 3D maskless micropattern approach represents a powerful avenue not only for the exploration of cell-material interactions in 3D, but also for the regeneration of functional tissues with well-organized microstructures.",

        "abstract": "Tissue clearing technique enables visualization of opaque organs and tissues in 3-dimensions (3-D) by turning tissue transparent. Current tissue clearing methods are restricted by limited types of tissues that can be cleared with each individual protocol, which inevitably led to the presence of blind-spots within whole body or body parts imaging. Hard tissues including bones and teeth are still the most difficult organs to be cleared. In addition, loss of endogenous fluorescence remains a major concern for solvent-based clearing methods. Here, we developed a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-associated solvent system (PEGASOS), which rendered nearly all types of tissues transparent and preserved endogenous fluorescence. Bones and teeth could be turned nearly invisible after clearing. The PEGASOS method turned the whole adult mouse body transparent and we were able to image an adult mouse head composed of bones, teeth, brain, muscles, and other tissues with no blind areas. Hard tissue transparency enabled us to reconstruct intact mandible, teeth, femur, or knee joint in 3-D. In addition, we managed to image intact mouse brain at sub-cellular resolution and to trace individual neurons and axons over a long distance. We also visualized dorsal root ganglions directly through vertebrae. Finally, we revealed the distribution pattern of neural network in 3-D within the marrow space of long bone. These results suggest that the PEGASOS method is a useful tool for general biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "Understanding cell-material interactions is a prerequisite for the development of bio-inspired materials for tissue regeneration. While nanofibrous biomaterials have been widely used in tissue regeneration, the effects of nanofibrous architecture on stem cell behaviors are largely ambiguous because the biomaterial systems used for nanofiber-cell interactions could not exclude the interference of cell-cell interactions. In this study, we developed a unique micropatterning technology to confine one single stem cell in a microisland of the nanofibrous micropatterned matrix; therefore, eliminating any potential intercellular communications. The nanofibrous micropatterned matrix, which mimicked both the physical architecture and chemical composition of natural extracellular matrix (ECM), was fabricated by a combination of electrospinning, chemical crosslinking, and UV-initiated photolithography. Compared to the non-nanofibrous architecture, a bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) cultured on the nanofibrous microisland exhibited a more in vivo-like morphology, a smaller spreading area, less focal adhesion, and fewer stress fibers. The BMSC cultured on the nanofibrous microisland also had higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, indicating nanofibrous architecture promoted BMSC differentiation. A mechanistic study reveals that nanofibers regulate single bone marrow stem cell osteogenesis via the FAK/RhoA/YAP1 pathway. The nanofibrous micropatterned matrix developed in this study is an excellent platform to promote the fundamental understanding of cell-matrix interactions, ultimately provide valuable insights for the development of novel bio-inspired scaffolds for tissue regeneration.",

Understanding how DM affects the activities of osteoclasts and the underlying mechanisms is crucial to the development of effective approaches for accelerating bone healing in DM condition. To date, however, the influence of DM on osteoclasts remains obscure and controversial. In this study, we established a type 2 DM (T2DM) alveolar bone defect model, which closely simulates the pathogenesis of human T2DM, to explore the diabetic osteoclast activity during bone regeneration. We found that a high glucose concentration diminished the formation of osteoclasts, and the differentiation and function of osteoclasts from T2DM rats were suppressed. The degradation of matrix by osteoclasts was significantly reduced at a high glucose concentration. In vivo experiments further indicated that T2DM inhibited osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, and delayed the degradation of matrix during the alveolar bone regeneration in T2DM rats. Our work clarifies the influence of T2DM on osteoclasts, and provides valuable insights for the design of novel scaffolding materials that target on osteoclasts for T2DM bone regeneration.

        "abstract": "Cells exhibit distinct 3D morphologies in vivo, and recapitulation of physiological cell morphologies in vitro is pivotal not only to elucidate many fundamental biological questions, but also to develop new approaches for tissue regeneration and drug screening. However, conventional cell culture methods in either a 2D petri dish or a 3D scaffold often lead to the loss of the physiological morphologies for many cells, such as bone cells (osteocytes) and dentinal cells (odontoblasts). Herein, a unique approach in developing a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM)-like micropatterned synthetic matrix as a physiologically relevant 3D platform is reported to recapitulate the morphologies of osteocytes and odontoblasts in vitro. The bio-inspired micropatterned matrix precisely mimics the hierarchic 3D nanofibrous tubular/canaliculi architecture as well as the compositions of the ECM of mineralized tissues, and is capable of controlling one single cell in a microisland of the matrix. Using this bio-inspired 3D platform, individual bone and dental stem cells are successfully manipulated to recapitulate the physiological morphologies of osteocytes and odontoblasts in vitro, respectively. This work provides an excellent platform for an in-depth understanding of cell-matrix interactions in 3D environments, paving the way for designing next-generation biomaterials for tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Bone repair and regeneration process is markedly impaired in diabetes mellitus (DM) that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. As a chronic inflammatory disease, DM creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment in defective sites. Most of the studies on DM-associated bone regeneration, however, neglect the importance of immuno-modulation in the DM condition and adopt the same approaches to normal bone healing, leading to limited bone healing. In this study, we developed a unique bio-inspired injectable microsphere as an osteo-immunomodulatory biomaterial that modulates macrophages to create a pro-healing microenvironment in the DM condition. The microsphere was self-assembled with heparin-modified gelatin nanofibers, and interleukin 4 (IL4) was incorporated into the nanofibrous heparin-modified gelatin microsphere (NHG-MS). IL4 has binding domains with heparin, and the binding of IL4 to heparin stabilizes this cytokine, protects it from denaturation and degradation, and subsequently prolongs its sustained release to modulate macrophage polarization. The IL-4-loaded NHG-MS switched the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage into a pro-healing M2 phenotype, recovered the M2/M1 ratio to a normal level, and efficiently resolved the inflammation, and ultimately enhanced osteoblastic differentiation and bone regeneration. The development of osteo-immunomodulatory biomaterials that harness the power of macrophages for immuno-modulation, therefore, is a novel and promising strategy to enhance bone regeneration in a DM condition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Pure and yttrium doped HfO 2  thin films were fabricated on Si (100) substrates by chemical solution deposition through a layer by layer crystallization process. We systematically investigated the effects of thickness and Y doped concentration on structure and electrical properties of the HfO 2  films. Results revealed that 4\u00a0nm thick undoped HfO 2  was crystallized into a t/c-phase due to the surface energy effect, and this higher symmetry phase could be retained up to a film thickness of 16\u00a0nm through the layer by layer crystallization process. This layer by layer crystallization process also required less Y doping to stabilize t/c-HfO 2  in thick films. The films showed a high dielectric constant about 42, low leakage current density of about 10 \u2212\u00a07 \u00a0A/cm 2  (at 1\u00a0MV/cm) and a breakdown field up to 5\u00a0MV/cm. Considering the cost-effective deposition technique and good electrical properties, these films would be suitable for insulator applications in microelectronic devices.",

The electrostatic capacitors characterized by high power density are competitive; however, their implementation in practical devices is limited by the low intrinsic energy storage density (ESD) of linear dielectrics like Al2O3. In this work, a detailed experimental investigation of energy storage properties is presented for 10\u2009nm thick silicon-doped hafnium oxide anti-ferroelectric thin films. Owing to high field induced polarization and slim double hysteresis, an extremely large ESD value of 61.2\u2009J/cm3 is achieved at 4.5\u2009MV/cm with a high efficiency of \u223c65%. In addition, the ESD and the efficiency exhibit robust thermal stability in 210\u2013400\u2009K temperature range and an excellent endurance up to 109 times of charge/discharge cycling at a very high electric field of 4.0\u2009MV/cm....",

The composition and chemical bonding features of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Y:HfO 2  film was integrated into metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure capacitors for electrical measurements. A transition of the polarization behavior from apparent ferroelectric-type to linear dielectric-type was observed for films with thickness increasing from 25\u202fnm to 80\u202fnm, which is correlated to the dominant crystal structure change from high-symmetry phase to monoclinic phase evidenced by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction analysis.",

In this work, the bipolar field cycling behavior has been investigated in detail for FE and AFE-like Si-doped HfO 2  films. Their apparent differences in fatigue and breakdown resistance are interpreted by the modified switching-induced charge-injection model. Referring to the first-order phase transition theory, we summarize and predict the evolution of polarization switching characteristic for FE, AFE-like and AFE Si-doped HfO 2  thin films stressed with bipolar field cycling. Additionally, several approaches are suggested to improve the endurance properties of ferroelectric HfO 2 -based thin films in terms of fabrication process and material design.",

        "abstract": "When a water droplet slides down a hydrophobic surface, a major energy it possesses is kinetic energy. However, people may ignore another important energy source: triboelectrification. To quantify and utilize triboelectrification energy, a phenomenon is presented in this study: one droplet slides down a tilted chip with a hydrophobic coating and patterned electrodes, triboelectrification happens and the induced charges are transferred to another horizontally placed chip with copper wires, on which another droplet is actuated by the transferred charges. The mechanism of this phenomenon is triboelectrification, electrostatic induction and EWOD (electrowetting on dielectrics). When an 80 \u03bcL droplet slides down the chip, the induced charges build up a potential difference between the electrodes of 46 V. With this potential difference, the droplet actuation is achieved not only on the horizontal chip, but also on the vertical chip. By patterning a comb-shaped electrode, functions for droplet manipulations are achieved. Theoretical analysis is conducted to quantify the frictional force, gravitational force and driving force (EWOD force). The presented concept and device could be employed for a self-powered digital microfluidics (DMF) system, replacing the bulky and energy consuming voltage sources which are commonly used in DMF devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) system has been intensively studied due to its reliability and environment-friendly property. In a STEG system, a solar absorber is an important component because it not only absorbs the solar energy, but also emits photons to environment as radiation heat loss. In this study, a selective absorber enhanced STEG system (SA-STEG) is presented. A Titanium nitride (TiN) based 2D photonic crystal (PhC) selective absorber is fabricated, which possesses a high absorptivity at short wavelength range to fully absorb the solar energy, but a suppressed absorptivity at long wavelength range to avoid the radiation loss. The selective absorber also keeps a good wavelength selectivity even after a thermal annealing over 1000\u202fK. The selective absorptivity data were imported into the SA-STEG model and an improvement was obtained: for a Lead telluride STEG system, a 28\u202fK temperature increase was achieved, and for a Silicon germanium alloy STEG system a 32\u202fK temperature increase was achieved. The increased temperature yields a larger open-circuit voltage output. These results were attained based on a 40\u202f\u00d7\u202f40\u202fmm 2  STEG system and this value is expected to be further increased if a larger thermoelectric generator is employed.",

Compared with saturated model and experiment results, the simulation is validated on the heating mode of the heat pump system. The distribution of the geo-temperature is predicted by using the model. Moreover, the evaporation especially surface evaporation is taken into account. The influencing factors such as soil saturated moisture content, soil actual moisture content and wind velocity are also studied in simulation. The results show that the evaporation has a great impact on the soil temperature field. Under the surface evaporation effect, the soil temperature decreases quickly in soil exothermic process and increases slowly in the recovery process. As the soil moisture rate and wind velocity increasing, the soil temperature falls quickly and recovers slowly under the intermittent operation of the heat pump system. The opposite results have been obtained with the effect of soil actual moisture content. Furthermore, all the results indicate that the effect attenuates with the depth of soil.",

The impact velocities studied in this paper are 0.1 m/s, 0.5 m/s, 0.94 m/s, and 1.2 m/s, respectively. The contact angles of the tube surfaces are 107\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 153\u00b0, respectively. It is found that, when the impact velocity is constant, the increase of the surface hydrophobicity values is detrimental to the spread of the liquid film on tubular surfaces. The larger the surface contact angle, the more likely the droplet rebound takes place. For a constant contact angle, the increase of the impact velocity is helpful to the droplet spread on a tubular surface. In the end, the mechanism of splashing and rebounding of droplet impact on a tubular surface with the contact angle of 135\u00b0 is explained through the distribution of the pressure and velocity fields.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Generally, the ideal materials for the membrane distillation are required highly porous with lowest thermal conduction and highly hydrophobic to avoid the pore wetting. Ceramic materials exhibit some excellent intrinsic properties, but cannot be directly used in membrane distillation due to the hydrophilic surface with rich hydroxyl groups. Changing the surface of ceramic to hydrophobic would open up its applications in membrane distillation. In this study, initiated chemical vapor deposition technique was applied to transfer the hydrophilic porous ceramic tubes with various inner structures into hydrophobic. The surface modified multi-layer porous ceramic tubes were applied in membrane distillation. The pore diameter of the porous ceramic plays a predominant role. They should have a reasonably large pore diameter to achieve better membrane distillation performance in terms of permeate flux, and also should have small pore diameter and narrow pore diameter distribution to limit the risk of membrane wetting. An important issue of this work was to find the proper inner structures of the porous ceramic tubes to enhance the liquid entry pressure without decreasing the permeate flux in membrane distillation application.",

Experiments were carried out to show how the heat transfer coefficient is affected by different parameters including heat flux, circumference direction of tubes, spray density, evaporation temperature, and experimental fluid. Results indicate that the heat transfer coefficient decreases after a little increase with growth of spray density. The heat transfer coefficient decreases along the tube circumference, but at the bottom of the tube, it shows increasing trend.

        "abstract": "Understanding the electron and phonon transport characteristics is crucial for designing and developing high performance thermoelectric materials. Weak scattering effects on charge carriers, characterized by deformation potential and alloy scattering potential, are favorable for thermoelectric solid solutions to enable high carrier mobility and thereby promising thermoelectric performance. Mg 2 (Si,Sn) solid solutions have attracted much attention due to their low cost and environmental compatibility. Usually, their high thermoelectric performance with ZT \u0303 1 is ascribed to the band convergence and reduced lattice thermal conductivity caused by alloying. In this work, both a low deformation potential = 13 eV and a low alloy scattering potential U = 0.7 eV are found for the thermoelectric alloys by characterizing and modeling of thermoelectric transport properties. The band convergence is also verified by the increased density-of-states effective mass. It is proposed that, in addition to band convergence and reduced lattice thermal conductivity, the low deformation potential and alloy scattering potential are additional intrinsic features that contribute to the high thermoelectric performance of the solid solutions.\u00a9 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

Here, the kinds of defects formed in Mg2X (X = Si, Ge, Sn) compounds are discussed and their influence mechanism on the thermoelectric performance by first-principles calculation is understood. Mg vacancies and interstitial Mg are found to be the dominant defects and their competition directly determines the different intrinsic conduction of Mg2X. Mg2Si always shows n-type, no matter what the Mg chemical potential is, while the conduction of Mg2Ge and Mg2Sn can change from p-type to n-type with increasing Mg chemical potential (Mg-rich condition). Interestingly it is also found that interstitial Mg shares electrons with lattice Mg, changes the charge density distribution, and produces the impurity-like level below the conduction band minimum. These results are helpful for understanding the roles of point defects in Mg2X and other thermoelectric compounds.",

        "abstract": "For decades, zone-melted Bi2Te3-based alloys have been the most widely used thermoelectric materials with an optimal operation regime near room temperature. However, the abundant waste heat in the mid-temperature range poses a challenge; namely, how and to what extent the service temperature of Bi2Te3-based alloys can be upshifted to the mid-temperature regime. We report herein a synergistic optimization procedure for Indium doping and hot deformation that combines intrinsic point defect engineering, band structure engineering and multiscale microstructuring. Indium doping modulated the intrinsic point defects, broadened the band gap and thus suppressed the detrimental bipolar effect in the mid-temperature regime; in addition, hot deformation treatment rendered a multiscale microstructure favorable for phonon scattering and the donor-like effect helped optimize the carrier concentration. As a result, a peak value of zT of ~1.4 was attained at 500\u2009K, with a state-of-the-art average zTav of ~1.3 between 400 and 600\u2009K in Bi0.3Sb1.625In0.075Te3. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multiple synergies that can also be applied to optimize other thermoelectric materials.",

        "abstract": "Mg2Si based solid solutions have unique advantages in the direct thermal to electrical energy conversion due to environmentally friendly and abundant constituent elements, and high thermoelectric performance. Further enhancing figure of merit zT of this materials system lies in the reduction of the relatively high lattice thermal conductivity. Alloying by high content of aliovalent Sb (>10%) in Mg2Si can greatly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity, lower than conventional Mg2(Si,Sn) solid solutions, due to the enhanced phonon scattering from Mg vacancy and concomitant strains. In this work, detailed microstructure observation for Sb alloyed Mg2Si reveal the existence of dense dislocations, around which the strip-like defects are viewed with isotropic strain. By introducing dislocations and vacancies as the additional phonon scattering sources, the model calculation can well match the experimental lattice thermal conductivity. The present work offers a comprehensive understanding of the role of vacancies and concomitant strains in reducing thermal conductivity, and may open a new venue for zT enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Forming solid solutions in PbTe based materials can simultaneously reduce lattice thermal conductivity and engineer the band structure to enhance the electrical properties. In this paper, quaternary alloys of Pb 1\u2212 x  Mg  x  Te 0.8 Se 0.2  were designed to improve the figure of merit  zT . The significant roles of MgTe in enhancing electrical properties and reducing thermal conductivity of PbTe 0.8 Se 0.2  were investigated. A maximum  zT  of \u223c2.2\u00a0at 820\u00a0K was achieved in PbTe 0.8 Se 0.2  with 8% MgTe. Subsequently, a large dimension bulk (\u223c200\u00a0g,  \u03a6 42\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018\u00a0mm) was fabricated and its homogeneity and the repeatability of high  zT  values were determined. The results show that high  zT  \u223c2.0 can also be achieved even in such a large sample. These results highlight the multi-functional roles of quaternary alloying with Mg and Se, and demonstrate the realistic prospect of large-scale commercial fabrication in high performance PbTe-based thermoelectric materials.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate nurses\u2019 knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and skills about evidence-based nursing, so as to provide theoretical evidence for the appro- priate direction and administrative practice in the relating training of nurses in clinical settings. Method A self-designed questionnaire based on national and international literature were used in this survey to measure nurses\u2019 knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and skills about evidence-based nursing among 101 nurses from 5 hospitals in Guangzhou between October and December, 2007. Results In the surveyed cohort, 63.7% were familiar with evidence-based nursing knowledge, most of whom with a bachelor\u2019s degree; and 31.5% knew about it to a certain level. However 4.8% of the cohort barely knew anything about it. 97.5% of the nurses held a positive attitude towards evidence-based nursing, while 18.4% mastered the evidence-based nursing skills. Many nurses (58.3%) had good skills in searching for relating knowledge and communicating with patients during the evidence-based nursing, but had low self- esteem in evaluating the quality of research and decision-making process. 20.8% of the nurses displayed searching actions to solve problems, most of whom were with high positions. 56.1% could used internet to acquire needed information to solve some clini- cal nursing problems in off time, however, 23.1% stuck to the old fashion and believed in solving problems according to pre-existed routines. Conclusions Nurses all hold a posi- tive and supporting attitude towards the practice of evidence-based nursing. However, a good percentage of the nursing staffs had little understanding about evidence-based nursing skills, which affect their behavior and skills in practice. It is suggested to provide more study opportunities for the nurses to learn knowledge and skills about evidence- based nursing from the aspects of education, administration and practice.",

        "abstract": "Inflammation has been correlated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Recent evidence suggests that TNF-\u03b1-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG-6) secreted by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) displays a remarkable ability to inhibit inflammatory processes in a variety of diseases. However, it is unknown whether BMSCs exert their therapeutic effect against IDD by secreting TSG-6. Here we investigated the effects of BMSCs and TSG-6 on IDD and explored the possible underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. We found that BMSCs and TSG-6 reduced the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13, and increased the expression of collagen II and aggrecan in the IL-1\u03b2-treated nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), but the protective effects of BMSCs and TSG-6 were attenuated when TSG-6 expression was silenced. We also found that the activation of the TLR2/NF-\u03baB pathway was inhibited by BMSCs and TSG-6. The levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the degenerated NPCs were reduced and the proliferation of IL-1\u03b2-treated NPCs was increased in the presence of BMSCs and TSG-6. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that BMSCs and TSG-6 restored the MRI T2-weighted signal intensity and increased collagen II and aggrecan expression in the degenerated nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues. Finally, our results showed that BMSCs and TSG-6 downregulated the TLR2/NF-\u03baB signaling and reduced the expression of MMPs and inflammatory cytokines in the degenerated NP tissues. The present study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of TLR2/NF-\u03baB pathway in the potential anti-IDD therapeutic effect of TSG-6, and the results provide new insight into the beneficial effect of BMSCs in the treatment of IDD.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-18 plays an important role in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We have previously demonstrated that remifentanil protects against liver I/R injury by upregulating the hepatic expression of IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), a natural IL-18 inhibitor. The current study was performed to further clarify the effects of remifentanil on IL-18BP expression in the liver as well as investigate the underlying mechanisms. In Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, we demonstrated that remifentanil significantly increased the expression of IL-18BP in normal rat liver tissue over a 24-h time period with maximal expression at 24\u2009h after treatment. The upregulation of remifentanil on IL-18BP expression displayed similar trends in in vitro cellular studies, including mouse primary hepatocytes, normal human hepatocyte LO2, and mouse hepatoma cells Hep1-6. In LO2 cells, preexposure of the cells to remifentanil significantly inhibited IL-18-activated p65 NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, and the inhibition was absent when the cells were transfected with IL-18BP siRNA, indicating the functional effects of IL-18BP induced by remifentanil. Pretreatment with actinomycin D abolished remifentanil-induced upregulation of IL-18BP mRNA, suggesting that the induction occurred at the transcriptional level. This was further supported by the luciferase reporter assay, which demonstrated that remifentanil treatment significantly increased transcription of the IL-18BP promoter. Both western blot analysis and ChIP assays showed that STAT1 and C/EBP \u03b2 were activated by remifentanil. Furthermore, remifentanil failed to upregulate IL-18BP expression after silencing STAT1 or C/EBP \u03b2 gene expression. These findings demonstrate that remifentanil could upregulate hepatic IL-18BP expression through transcriptional activation of the IL-18BP promoter, and STAT1 and C/EBP \u03b2 are two key transcriptional factors involved in this process.",

The following is a case of a 29-year-old patient with a previous major depressive episode comorbid with CLIPPERS. Following glucocorticosteroid therapy, the patient switched to mania-like presentation and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. So it is strongly suggested that high-dose corticosteroid pulse therapy could easily induce psychiatric disturbances for patients with previous psychiatric symptoms, and there may be potential links between bipolar disorder and CLIPPERS in the area of inflammation.",

In this paper, we aimed to explore whether peripheral neurotrophic factors could be helpful for early detection of bipolar depression.  A screening method combining peripheral biomarkers and clinical characteristics was applied in 30 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 23 patients with depressive episode of bipolar disorder. By a model-based algorithm, some information was extracted from the dataset and used as a \"model\" to approach penalized regression model for stably differential diagnosis for bipolar depression.  A simple and efficient model of approaching the diagnosis of individuals with depressive symptoms was established with a fitting degree (90.58%) and an acceptable cross-validation error rate. Neurotrophic factors of our interest were successfully screened out from the feature selection and optimized model performance as reliable predictive variables.  It seems to be feasible to combine different types of clinical characteristics with biomarkers in order to detect bipolarity of all depressive episodes. Neurotrophic factors of our interest presented its stable discriminant potentiality in unipolar and bipolar depression, deserving validation analysis in larger samples.",

        "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of scriptaid treatment on histone H3 on lysine 18 (H3K18) acetylation and relative expression levels of genes related to histone acetylation (HAT1, CBP, and p300) in buffalo oocytes during IVM. Meanwhile, the embryonic developmental ability of buffalo oocytes after SCNT was also examined. The H3K18 acetylation in oocytes increased from the germinal vesicle (GV) stage to the GV breakdown (GVBD) stage and arrived at a high acetylation level at the GVBD stage. Then, the H3K18 deacetylated completely at the metaphase I (MI) and acetylated again at the MII stage. However, addition of 500-nM scriptaid to the maturation medium resulted in a significant increase in the H3K18 acetylation at the MI stage. The expression profiles of genes related to histone acetylation (HAT1, CBP, and p300) in the meiosis stages of oocytes matured in the medium supplemented with 500-nM scriptaid were significantly higher than those of the oocytes matured in the medium without scriptaid (P < 0.05) with the exception of p300 at the GVBD stage. More SCNT embryos reconstructed with oocytes matured in the medium supplemented with 500-nM scriptaid developed to blastocysts (23.1%) in comparison with oocytes matured in the medium without scriptaid (13.8%, P < 0.05). These results indicate that scriptaid can increase the histone acetylation of buffalo oocytes during meiotic maturation and improve their ability to support the development of SCNT embryos.",

        "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of cytoplasmic volume on nucleus reprogramming and developmental competence of buffalo handmade cloning (HMC) embryos. We found that both HMC embryos derived from ~150% cytoplasm or ~225% cytoplasm resulted in a higher blastocyst rate and total cell number of blastocyst in comparison with those from ~75% cytoplasm (25.4 \u00b1 2.0%, 27.9 \u00b1 1.6% vs. 17.9 \u00b1 3.1%; 150 \u00b1 10, 169 \u00b1 12 vs. 85 \u00b1 6, P<0.05). Meanwhile, the proportions of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and premature chromosome condensation (PCC) were also increased in the embryos derived from ~150% or ~225% enucleated cytoplasm compared to those from ~75% cytoplasm. Moreover, HMC embryos derived from ~225% cytoplasm showed a decrease of global DNA methylation from the 2-cell to the 4-cell stage in comparison with those of ~75% cytoplasm (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression of embryonic genome activation (EGA) relative genes (eIF1A and U2AF) in HMC embryos derived from ~225% cytoplasm at the 8-cell stages was also found to be enhanced compared with that of the ~75% cytoplasm. Two of seven recipients were confirmed to be pregnant following transfer of blastocysts derived from ~225% cytoplasm, and one healthy cloned calf was delivered at the end of the gestation period, whereas no recipients were pregnant after the transfer of blastocysts derived from ~75% cytoplasm. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic volume of recipient oocytes affects donor nucleus reprogramming, and then further accounted for the developmental ability of the reconstructed embryos.",

        "abstract": "A new, more effective and environmentally friendly method involving a complex enzyme combined with ultrasonication was employed to extract and isolate three novel polysaccharides (HPS-MCs: HPS-MC, HPS-MC (50%) and HPS-MC (80%)) of Radix Hedysari. Compared with polysaccharides obtained using a traditional extraction method (hot water extraction, HPS-R), the yields and total carbohydrate contents of HPS-MCs were significantly higher. HPS-MC (80%) exhibited relatively strong immunomodulatory activity and a concentration-dependent dose-response relationship under cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced immunosuppressive conditions in mice models. To more comprehensively investigate the relationships between structural characteristics and immunomodulatory activity, HPS-MC (80%) was fractionated into three major homogeneous polysaccharide fractions (HPS-MC (80%)s: HPS-MC (80%)-1, HPS-MC (80%)-2, and HPS-MC (80%)-3). These three homogeneous polysaccharides had different mass percentages of monosaccharides species (rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, and galactose) by gas chromatography (GC) and different molecular weights and chain conformations by high-performance gel permeation chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (HPGPC-MALLS), and promoted macrophage and splenocyte proliferation to different degrees. These findings indicated that HPS-MC (80%) had a prominent potential immune response, especially HPS-MC (80%)-2 and HPS-MC (80%)-3, and might be suitable candidates for functional foods or potential novel immunomodulators.",

The present study was undertaken to explore the anti-gastric ulcer potential effect of Hedysarum polysaccharides (HPS; HPS-50, HPS-80), the principal active fraction of Radix Hedysari (RH). The anti-gastric ulcer effects of HPS were evaluated using an animal model of ulcerative lesions induced by acetic acid. The effects of antioxidant factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and mucosal blood flow regulatory factor levels in the gastric tissue homogenate of rats were analyzed for the bioactivities of HPS. The results showed that, compared with the acetic acid-induced ulcerated group, the ulcer inhibition rate of HPS-treated rats was significantly increased. The pathological findings suggested that mucosal regeneration, cell migration, and inflammatory cell infiltration were decreased, and collagen fibers were significantly reduced. Extensive granulation tissue proliferation indicated the healing stage was initiated, suggesting a good prognosis. The oxidative stress status of the gastric ulcer rats was improved, the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly decreased, and the levels of PGE-2 and NO were increased (P < 0.05). HPS-80-H may be a promising ingredient for incorporation into functional foods or nutritional supplements for the prevention of gastric ulcers.",

        "title": "Arginase Inhibitor Reacts with Hemoglobin to Form Nitrite",
        "abstract": "Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is found in endothelial cells and has recently been found to also be present in red blood cells (RBCs). eNOS can catalyze L-arginine conversion to citrulline and produce nitric oxide (NO). L-arginine can also be converted to L-ornithine and urea through the activity of arginase which consumes L-arginine in blood. Due to their having a common substrate (arginine), arginase would compete with eNOS and limit NO signaling. Inside the RBC, NO formed from NOS is expected to form nitrate through its reaction with oxygenated hemoglobin, but nitrite formation has also been reported.  In our study, N \u03c9 -hydroxy-nor-Arginine (nor-NOHA, 0.1mM and 1mM), an arginase inhibitor, was added to either RBCs, whole blood, or isolated hemoglobin. An arginase inhibitor is expected to increases RBC nitrite and nitrate due to increases in arginine available for NOS and this has been shown by others. We observed that all the samples treated with nor-NOHA produce more nitrite and nitrate than without nor-NOHA. That nor-NOHA would increase nitrite and nitrate in RBCs and whole blood is to be expected, but Hb, by itself should not result in these NO metabolites if their increase is due to NOS activity. Thus, we suspect that nitrite and nitrate are formed from a direct reaction of hemoglobin and nor-NOHA.  When 3 mM arginine was added to whole blood, nitrite yields significantly increased. However, when arginine was added to RBCs alone, there was no significant increase in nitrite. Addition of the NOS inhibitor L-N G -Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) resulted in significant reductions in nitrite, supporting some NOS activity. However, in the presence of nor-NOHA, L-NAME had little to no effect on RBC and whole blood formation of nitrite, consistent with the proposal that most of the nitrite formed is due to a direct reaction of hemoglobin with nor-NOHA.  Our data suggest that addition of nor-NOHA to RBCs with the goal using increased nitrite and nitrate as a method to study NOS activity is unwarranted. These results have implications in past and future use of nor-NOHA that perhaps incorrectly purport to be studying RBC NOS.",

The results indicate that: (1) Four stages of grain shoals developed longitudinally and two main shoals with one trench formed laterally in the development area; (2) Three types of reservoirs are identified, which are reservoir with millimeter sized dissolved vugs, reservoir with solution pores, and reservoir with inter-particle/inter-crystal pores; (3) Low matrix porosity but mid-to-high permeability affected by developed high-dip fractures; and (4) Three gas/water contacts (GWC) can be defined and step down from west to east, with a unique gas/water contact of \u22124 385 m in the target developing area. Based on geologic characterization, reservoir simulation and case study of similar gas reservoirs, the development strategies are made: to select the main grain shoal area as the prior production area; to locate wells on the structural high to delay edge water breakthrough and prolong stable production; to drill horizontal wells enhancing single well deliverability; to keep reasonable production of wells for improving the production effect.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Through analyzing the development of large ultra-deep structural gas fields in China, strategies for the efficient development of such gas fields are proposed based on their geological characteristics and production performance. According to matrix properties, fracture development degree and configuration between matrix and fractures, the reservoirs are classified into three types: single porosity single permeability system, dual porosity dual permeability system, and dual porosity single permeability system. These three types of gas reservoirs show remarkable differences in different scales of permeability, the ratio of dynamic reserves to volumetric reserves and water invasion risk. It is pointed out that the key factors affecting development efficiency of these gas fields are determination of production scale and rapid identification of water invasion. Figuring out the characteristics of the gas fields and working out pertinent technical policies are the keys to achieve efficient development. The specific strategies include reinforcing early production appraisal before full scale production by deploying high precision development seismic survey, deploying development appraisal wells in batches and scale production test to get a clear understanding on the structure, reservoir type, distribution pattern of gas and water, and recoverable reserves, controlling production construction pace to ensure enough evaluation time and accurate evaluation results in the early stage, in line with the development program made according to the recoverable reserves, working out proper development strategies, optimizing pattern and proration of wells based on water invasion risk and gas supply capacity of matrix, and reinforcing research and development of key technologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on performance data of over 600 wells in 32 large gas fields of different types in China, the correlation is established between per-well average dynamic reserves (        G  \u00af    ) and average initial absolute open flow potential (          q  \u00af    IAOF      ) of each field, and its connotation and applicability are further discussed through theoretical deduction. In log-log plot,        G  \u00af     vs.          q  \u00af    IAOF       exhibit highly dependent linear trend, which implicates the compatibility between        G  \u00af     and          q  \u00af    IAOF       attained through development optimization to reach the balance among annual flow capacity, maximum profits and certain production plateau, that is to match productivity with rate maintenance capacity. The correlation can be used as analogue in new gas field development planning to evaluate the minimum dynamic reserves which meet the requirement of stable and profitable production, and facilitate well pattern arrangement. It can also serve as criteria to appraise the effectiveness and infill drilling potential of well patterns for developed gas fields.",

We find that source contexts have a direct impact on the  adequacy \u00a0of a translation while target contexts affect the  fluency . Intuitively, generation of a content word should rely more on the source context and generation of a functional word should rely more on the target context. Due to the lack of effective control over the influence from source and target contexts, conventional NMT tends to yield fluent but inadequate translations. To address this problem, we propose  context gates  which dynamically control the ratios at which source and target contexts contribute to the generation of target words. In this way, we can enhance both the adequacy and fluency of NMT with more careful control of the information flow from contexts. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves upon a standard attention-based NMT system by +2.3 BLEU points.",

It has been widely observed that NMT tends to repeatedly translate some source words while mistakenly ignoring other words. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework for NMT. The reconstructor, incorporated into the NMT model, manages to reconstruct the input source sentence from the hidden layer of the output target sentence, to ensure that the information in the source side is transformed to the target side as much as possible. Experiments show that the proposed framework significantly improves the adequacy of NMT output and achieves superior translation result over state-of-the-art NMT and statistical MT systems.",

Specifically, we first predict a chunk time-scale state for phrasal modeling, on top of which multiple word time-scale states are generated.

        "abstract": "Low rank methods have shown to provide excellent denoising performance, of which weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) is particularly effective. It assigns different weights to different singular values. However, it has limitations in three aspects, namely, no consideration of the noise effect on the similarity measure, a fixed feedback proportion of method noise, and an inflexible number of iterations for each image. In this paper, a general denoising framework based on WNNM is proposed that offers three strategies to mitigate the above drawbacks. The first strategy is to perform a coarse prefiltering on noisy patches before patch matching. The second is to adaptively feed different percentages of method noise back according to the additive noise levels. And the last strategy is to apply a stopping criterion based on Pearson's correlation coefficient during iteration. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

However, surface scratches affected by the molding temperature and microdimples on the lens surface caused by gas release seriously impair the quality of the formed lens. To reduce these surface defects when molding GeSeAs ChG, the temperature effect must be studied, and the gas generation must be minimized, while the gas escape must be maximized. In this work, we studied the effect of temperature on the surface defects. Additionally, we studied the influences of the roughness and curvature of the contact surfaces, as well as the pressing force on the formation of the microdimples. It was found that the molding temperature should be approximately 30\u00b0C higher than the softening temperature (T) to avoid surface scratches. The gas generation could be inhibited by increasing the pressing force and decreasing the roughness of the mold surface, and finally, increasing the curvature difference between the mold and glass preform surfaces improved the gas escape.",

        "abstract": "Chalcogenide glass (ChG) is increasingly used in infrared optical systems owing to its excellent infrared optical properties and scalable production using precision glass molding (PGM). However, surface scratches affected by the molding temperature and microdimples on the lens surface caused by gas release seriously impair the quality of the formed lens. To reduce these surface defects when molding Ge22Se58As20 ChG, the temperature effect must be studied, and the gas generation must be minimized, while the gas escape must be maximized. In this work, we studied the effect of temperature on the surface defects. Additionally, we studied the influences of the roughness and curvature of the contact surfaces, as well as the pressing force on the formation of the microdimples. It was found that the molding temperature should be approximately 30\u00b0C higher than the softening temperature (Ts) to avoid surface scratches. The gas generation could be inhibited by increasing the pressing force and decreasing the roughness of the mold surface, and finally, increasing the curvature difference between the mold and glass preform surfaces improved the gas escape.",

The deformation mechanisms of these glasses at the molding temperature involve elasticity, plasticity, and viscous flow, which call for a new theoretical model to assist the design of PGM process. This paper investigates the thermo-mechanical properties of Ge22Se58As20 at the temperature above its softening point and establishes a new elastic-viscoplasticity model to describe its thermo-mechanical behaviors. After determining the model parameters through cylindrical compression tests, the new constitutive model is implemented in finite element method (FEM) of PGM to form an aspheric ChG lens. And the agreement of displacement-time curves between experimental and simulation results exhibit the validity of the proposed elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model.",

However, such anticipated properties are hardly possible due to a number of factors. For example, the weak bonding of CNTf with polymers at the interface which results in easy delamination and deteriorated properties of the CNTf/polymer composites. More still, the declined conductivity of composites highly contributed by the insulating polymers. Herein, an approach to solve the mentioned problems is reported which briefly involved first modifying the polymer (epoxy resin) with the CNT in controlled percentages, and then introducing the CNTf to the modified epoxy solution which synergistically created a new CNT-to-CNT interphase and interlocked interactions, hence, presenting enhanced peeling (74.38%) and tensile (164.76%) strength in modified composites as compared to the unmodified CNTf/epoxy composites. Moreover, the strain sensing, conductivity, and temperature responses of the composites were also significantly improved as required in various high-performance composites.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The interfacial bonding between carbon nanotube (CNT) films and epoxy is usually fairly weak for high quality composites and difficult to be measured experimentally. In this study, the interfacial bonding strength between a CNT film and epoxy is measured using a peeling test. The CNT/epoxy interfacial bonding strength is altered by surface functionalization of the CNT film using atmospheric pressure helium/oxygen plasma. Furthermore, composites with the control and the modified CNT film impregnated in epoxy are manufactured, and their mechanical properties including peeling strengths and tensile strengths are improved remarkably due to enhanced CNT/epoxy bonding after plasma functionalization. The peeling strength between the CNT film and epoxy is increased by 156.6% and so is the fracture energy. The tensile strength of the functionalized CNT film/epoxy composites is 74.4% higher than that with original CNT film. The effect of the treatment time (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3s) is assessed by surface chemical and physical analyses, showing an improvement in the amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on CNT surface, and better dispersion of the CNTs in ethanol with increased treatment time. This benefits the wetting and infiltration into CNTs by epoxy to obtain a stronger interfacial bonding.",

        "abstract": "A new model has been developed to account for adduct formation on multiply charged peptides observed in negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry. To obtain a stable adduct, the model necessitates an approximate matching of apparent gas-phase basicity (GB(app)) of a given proton bearing site on the peptide with the gas-phase basicity (GB) of the anion attaching at that site. Evidence supporting the model is derived from the fact that for [Glu] Fibrinopeptide B, higher GB anions dominated in adducts observed at higher negative charge states, whereas lower GB anions appeared predominately in lower charge state adducts. Singly charged adducts were only observed for lower GB anions: HSO(4)(-), I(-), CF(3)COO(-). Ions that have medium GBs (NO(3) (-), Br(-), H(2)PO(4)(-)) only form adducts having -2 charge states, whereas Cl(-) (higher GB) can form adducts having -3 charge states. The model portends that (1) carboxylate groups are much more basic than available amino groups; (2) apparent GBs of the various carboxylate groups on peptides do not vary substantially from one another; and (3) apparent GBs of the individual carboxylate and amino sites do not behave independently. This model was developed for negative ion attachment but an analogous mechanism is also proposed for the positive ion mode wherein (1) binding of a neutral at an amino site polarizes this amino group, but hardly affects apparent GBs of other sites; (2) proton addition (charge state augmentation) at one site can decrease the instrinsic GBs of other potential protonation sites and lower their apparent GBs.",

        "abstract": "The \"Best Match\" model has been extended to account for the role that Na(+)/H(+) exchange plays on anion attachment in negative ion electrospray. Without any Na(+)/H(+) exchange on (Glu) fibrinopeptide B, the higher basicity anions F(-) and CH3COO(-) can hardly form observable adducts; however, after multiple Na(+)/H(+) exchanges, adduct formation is enabled. Moreover, dissociation pathways of CF3COO(-) adducts with singly deprotonated peptides that have undergone 0 to 3 Na(+)/H(+) exchanges exhibit a shift in CID product ions from losing predominately CF3COOH (case of 0 Na(+)/H(+) exchanges) to losing predominately CF3COO(-) (case of 3 Na(+)/H(+) exchanges). These phenomena can be rationalized by considering that Na(+) cations exchange at, and serve to \"block\", the most acidic sites, thereby forcing implicated anions to attach to lower acidity protons. In addition to forming ion pairs with carboxylate groups, Na(+) also participates in formation of tri-atomic ions of the form ANaA(-) during adduct dissociation. The fact that low gas-phase basicity (GB) anions preferentially form ANaA(-) species, even though high GB anions form more stable tri-atomic species, indicates that the monatomic ions were not in close contact in the initial adduct. The propensity for formation of stable anionic adducts is dependent on the degree of matching between anion GBs and GBapp of deprotonated sites on the peptide. The GBapp is raised dramatically as the charge state of the peptide increases via a through-space effect. The presence of Na(+) on carboxylate sites substantially decreases the GBapp by neutralizing these sites, while slightly increasing the intrinsic GBs by an inductive effect.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have revealed that ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is closely associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is a relative paucity of laboratory data to support this epidemic finding. In order to assess the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and ASD, neonatal male Sprague-Dawley rats were chosen and exposed to PM2.5 (2 or 20\u2009mg/kg body weight, once a day) by intranasal instillation from postnatal day 8 to 22. It was found that when exposed to PM2.5 in the early neonatal period for two weeks, both groups of the exposure rats manifested typical behavioral features of autism, including communication deficits, poor social interaction, and novelty avoidance. And, we further found, among five ASD candidate genes we chose, both the mRNA level and protein expression of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (Shank3) decreased significantly in the rat hippocampus after high dose of PM2.5 exposure. Moreover, results showed that PM2.5-exposure significantly increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1\u03b2, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule, markers of astrocytes and microglial cell activation, respectively, also increased in the exposed animals. Our work provides new data on the link between postnatal exposure to ambient PM2.5 and the onset of ASD-like symptoms in human beings, and the increased inflammatory response and abnormalities in Shank3 expression in the brain may contribute to the mechanisms of PM2.5 exposure-induced ASD.",

        "abstract": "Our study determined the toxic effects of zinc oxide (ZnO) particles with different diameters on dopaminergic (DA) neurons, the role of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) for ZnO particles-induced neurotoxicity, and corresponding molecular mechanisms. We constructed an in vitro cell injury model for DA neurons to analyze the cytotoxicity of ZnO particles using SH-SY5Y cells. Following cell viability assays and flow cytometry, we found that the cytotoxicity of ZnO particles was affected by particle size, time, and dose of exposure. For example, the toxicity of ZnO particles with 50\u202fnm or 100\u202fnm diameter was stronger than that of ZnO particles with 1000\u202fnm diameter. Furthermore, ZnO particles exposure resulted in a significant decrease in UCH-L1 expression in SH-SY5Y; whereas UCH-L1 overexpression led to a significant increase in cell viability and a sharp decrease in ROS level. Western blotting and adenovirus transfection found that exposure to ZnO particles with different diameters all activate the NF-\u03baB signaling in SH-SY5Y cells; whereas UCH-L1 over-expression resulted in increased levels of I\u03baB\u03b1, an endogenous inhibitor of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ZnO particles with different diameters all induced cytotoxicity in DA neurons, which may be related to the free Zn in the suspension. Regarding the neurotoxic effect of ZnO particles, UCH-L1 protects against and/or alleviates neuronal damage, possibly by deubiquitination of the endogenous inhibitor, I\u03baB\u03b1, which leads to activation of NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, one possible mechanism for ZnO particle-induced neurotoxicity may be mediated via the down-regulation of UCH-L1 expression in DA cells.",

The binding of the two enantiomers with the triplex RNA poly(U)\u2022poly(A)*poly(U) was carried out by various biophysical techniques. Analysis of the absorption and fluorescence features indicates that the binding strengths of the two enantiomers toward the triplex RNA differ only slightly from each other. The total increase in viscosity and shape of the curves for the triplex RNA with \u039b-1 is similar to that with \u0394-1, suggesting the binding modes of two enantiomers with the triplex RNA are intercalation. Thermal melting measurements indicate that the stabilization effects clearly depended on the concentrations of \u039b-1 and \u0394-1. However, the third-strand stabilizing effect of \u0394-1 dramatically differs from that of \u039b-1 when they interact with the chiral environment of the RNA triple at pH\u202f=\u202f7.0 and [Na]\u202f=\u202f35\u202fmM. Combined with the CD (CD\u202f=\u202fcircular dichroism) variations of the triplex RNA with either \u039b-1 or \u0394-1, the reason for their different triplex stabilization effects may originate from the two enantiomers through different orientations intercalating into nucleobases of the triplex. In addition, effects of higher ionic strengths on the triplex stabilization in the absence and presence of the two enantiomers have also been studied. The results presented here may be useful for understanding the binding properties of the triplex RNA with small molecule, particularly chiral ruthenium(II) complexes.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of [Ru(phen)dppz-idzo] (phen\u202f=\u202f1,10-phenanthroline, dppz-idzo\u202f=\u202fdppz-imidazolone) with triplex RNA poly(U)\u00b7poly(A)*poly(U) was carried out by using spectroscopic and viscometric techniques in this work. Luminescent titrations suggest that [Ru(phen)dppz-idzo] shows better selectivity for poly(U)\u00b7poly(A)*poly(U) compared with poly(U)\u00b7poly(A) and poly(U), this complex exhibits a \"light switch\" effect with an emission enhancement factor of about 123 in the presence of poly(U)\u00b7poly(A)*poly(U). Significantly, this \"light switch\" behavior could even be observed by the naked eye under irradiation with UV light. To our knowledge, [Ru(bpy)dppz-idzo] is the first small molecule able to serve as a colorimetric molecular \"light switch\" for the triplex poly(U)\u00b7poly(A)*poly(U). Combined with the spectral and viscometric results as well as [Ru(phen)dppz-idzo] stabilizing the template duplex poly(U)\u00b7poly(A), we speculate that [Ru(phen)dppz-idzo] prefers to bind with the Hoogsteen base-paired strand (the third strand) of the triplex, thus the intercalating [Ru(phen)dppz-idzo] stabilizing the third strand is more marked in comparison with the Watson-Crick base-paired duplex of the triplex. The results obtained here may be useful for understanding the interaction of triplex RNA poly(U)\u00b7poly(A)*poly(U) with small molecule, particularly ruthenium(II) complexes.",

The binding properties of Ru 1  and Ru 2  with the triplex has been studied by spectroscopic methods and viscosity measurements. Analysis of the electronic absorption spectra suggests that the binding of intercalating Ru 1  with the triplex is greater than that of Ru 2 , which is also supported by spectroscopic titrations and viscosity measurements. Thermal denaturation studies suggest that the two complexes stabilize the Watson-Crick base-paired duplex of the triplex structure almost without affecting the stability of the Hoogsteen base-paired third strand, suggesting that the electron-withdrawing effect of cyano group hardly increases the binding strengths of the third strand and the template duplex of the triplex under study here. Changes in the CD (CD\u202f=\u202fcircular dichroism) spectra of the triplex indicate that the binding-induced CD perturbation of the triplex structure is more marked with Ru 1 . The main results obtained here indicate that small differences in the ancillary ligands play important roles in the triplex binding when ruthenium(II) complexes contain the same intercalative ligands.",

It may usually be misdiagnosed as inflammation including pulmonary tuberculosis, even lung cancer, because its clinical symptoms and signs are often nonspecific. The final diagnosis usually depends on lung biopsy. Herein, we report a case of PPDLBCL and review of diagnosis of this disease, particularly in radiology. A 44-year-old man presented with cough, sputum, and intermittent chest pain for 4 weeks. Multiple radiological examinations showed an irregular mass in the right upper lobe with ground-glass opacities around it and air-filled bronchi in the consolidation. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected positive FDG uptake, and diffusion-weighted imaging indicated abnormal hyperintension in the lesion. Inflammation was suspected, but malignance cannot be excluded. Finally, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed for histological examination and definitive diagnosis yielded lymphomatous cells infiltration in the right upper lobe. This report emphasizes the significance of multimodality radiological examinations. Multimodality imaging contributes to proper diagnosis, staging, and management of lymphomas.",

        "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate whole-brain three-dimensional arterial spin labeling imaging (3D ASL) and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI), in regards to their diagnostic value of preoperative glioma grade. The parameter values obtained after correction will be correlated with the diagnostic value of 3D ASL and DSC-PWI perfusion. In the current study, 50 patients with gliomas confirmed by pathology were used, including 27 low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and 23 high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Prior to surgery all patients underwent 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 3D ASL, DSC-PWI and conventional enhanced MRI scans to obtain original 3D ASL and DSC-PWI images, and the tumor regions with the most obvious parenchyma perfusion and contralateral normal white matter were selected. In these areas, the ASL-relative cerebral blood flow (ASL-rCBF), DSC-relative cerebral blood flow (DSC-rCBF) and DSC-relative cerebral blood volume (DSC-rCBV) parameter values were then obtained after correction for individual differences. The results of the present study show that ASL-CBF, DSC-CBF, DSC-CBV values and ASL-rCBF, DSC-rCBF, DSC-rCBV values increased as the grade of the glioma being imaged increased, and there was a marked difference between the HGGs and the LGGs. ASL-rCBF was significantly positively correlated with DSC-rCBF (r=0.580, P<0.01). In addition, ASL-rCBF was significantly positively correlated with DSC-rCBV (r=0.431, P<0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to compare the two perfusion parameters of DSC-PWI and 3D ASL in the diagnosis of glioma grade. ASL-rCBF had the highest area value under the ROC curve (0.836). The areas under the ROC curve of DSC-rCBF and DSC-rCBV were analyzed using the Z test, but the difference was not statistically significant. When ASL-rCBF, DSC-rCBF and DSC-rCBV were cutoff at 2.24, 1.85 and 1.68, the sensitivity of HGG diagnosis was 83.2, 91.3 and 91.3%, and the specificity was 77.7, 63.9 and 66.7%, respectively.",

PCV2 entered and replicated in human cells, and infectious virions were generated, indicating that human cell lines were permissive to PCV2 replication. Furthermore, PCV2 replication in human cell lines was enhanced by D-glucosamine or concanavalin A (ConA). However, the infection efficiency of PCV2 was lower in human cells than in PK-15 cells, suggesting that PCV2 infection was limited in human cells.

To date, many studies have reported that several cofactors, such as other swine viruses or bacteria, vaccination failure, and stress or crowding, in combination with PCV2, lead to PCVD/PCVAD. Among these cofactors, co-infection of PCV2 with other viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, swine influenza virus and classical swine fever virus have been widely studied for decades.

We previously found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is negatively associated with PCV2 infection in vitro and in vivo. HMGCR inhibits the early stages of PCV2 infection, while PCV2 infection induces the phosphorylation of HMGCR to inactivate the protein. In this study, we investigated the possibility that adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) participate in HMGCR-mediated inhibition of PCV2 infection and the interaction of porcine HMGCR with PCV2 proteins. The results showed that AMPK activity fluctuated in cells during the early stage of PCV2 infection, while PP2A had little effect on PCV2 infection and HMGCR activity. Furthermore, PCV2 infection may enhance or maintain the level of phosphorylated HMGCR by directly interacting with the protein in PK-15 cells. These findings may provide a better understanding of PCV2 pathogenesis, and HMGCR may be a novel PCV2 antiviral target.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous inflammation alters the function of primary afferents and gene expression in the affected dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, specific mechanisms of injury-induced peripheral afferent sensitization and behavioral hypersensitivity during development are not fully understood. Recent studies in children suggest a potential role for growth hormone (GH) in pain modulation. Growth hormone modulates homeostasis and tissue repair after injury, but how GH affects nociception in neonates is not known. To determine whether GH played a role in modulating sensory neuron function and hyperresponsiveness during skin inflammation in young mice, we examined behavioral hypersensitivity and the response properties of cutaneous afferents using an ex vivo hairy skin-saphenous nerve-DRG-spinal cord preparation. Results show that inflammation of the hairy hind paw skin initiated at either postnatal day 7 (P7) or P14 reduced GH levels specifically in the affected skin. Furthermore, pretreatment of inflamed mice with exogenous GH reversed mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in addition to altering nociceptor function. These effects may be mediated through an upregulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFr1) as GH modulated the transcriptional output of IGFr1 in DRG neurons in vitro and in vivo. Afferent-selective knockdown of IGFr1 during inflammation also prevented the observed injury-induced alterations in cutaneous afferents and behavioral hypersensitivity similar to that after GH pretreatment. These results suggest that GH can block inflammation-induced nociceptor sensitization during postnatal development leading to reduced pain-like behaviors, possibly by suppressing the upregulation of IGFr1 within DRG.",

We recently discovered that growth hormone (GH) is a key regulator of afferent sensitization and pain-related behaviors during developmental inflammation of the skin. Peripheral injury caused a significant reduction in cutaneous GH levels, which corresponded with the observed hypersensitivity. However, it has yet to be determined whether GH deficiency (GHD) is sufficient to drive peripheral sensitization in uninjured animals. Here, we found that systemic GHD, induced by knockout of the GH release hormone receptor (GHRHr), was able to induce behavioral and afferent hypersensitivity to peripheral stimuli specifically during early developmental stages. GHD also produced an upregulation of many receptors and channels linked to nociceptive processing in the DRGs at these early postnatal ages (P7 and P14). Surprisingly, P21 GHRHr knockouts also displayed significant alterations in DRG gene expression even though behavioral and afferent hypersensitivity resolved. These data support previous findings that GH is a key modulator of neonatal hypersensitivity. Results may provide insight into whether GH treatment may be a therapeutic strategy for pediatric pain.",

        "abstract": "This is the first report on occurrence and genetic characteristics of E. bieneusi in ethnic minority groups in China. Genotype Peru6 was found in humans in China for the first time and showed dominance in Yao people. The same genotype was found in some family members and all the genotypes fell into group 1, suggesting the possibility of anthroponotic and zoonotic transmissions. The majority (83.33%, 20/24) of E. bieneusi positive individuals did not present diarrhea. In any case, it is important to recognize their existence and the importance that asymptomatic individuals to E. bieneusi may have from an epidemiological point of view, as transmitters of this pathogen. The analysis of risk factors provides scientific evidence for the development of effective strategies for prevention and control of E. bieneusi infection.",

        "abstract": "Blastocystis is one of the most common intestinal parasites in humans worldwide. To understand its prevalence and to explore the risk factors for Blastocystis in humans in developing countries, a molecular epidemiological investigation of Blastocystis was conducted in ethnic minority groups on both sides of the China-Myanmar border. A total of 461 fecal specimens were collected from 289 Yao people in China and 172 Wa people in Myanmar, together with a questionnaire for each participant. Based on sequence analysis of the partial small subunit of ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene (barcode region or 260\u00a0bp region), an average prevalence of 6.29% (29/461) was observed, with 4.50% (13/289) in Yao people and 9.30% (16/172) in Wa people. Twenty-two Blastocystis isolates were successfully subtyped by sequence analysis of the barcode region. Three subtypes were identified: ST1 (n\u00a0=\u00a07), ST3 (n\u00a0=\u00a013) and ST4 (n\u00a0=\u00a02). A statistical difference in the prevalence of Blastocystis was only observed between children (12.37%, 12/97) and adults (4.95%, 16/323), and between not washing hands (11.02%, 14/127) and washing hands (4.76%, 15/315) after using toilets, emphasizing the importance and necessity of health education in people in the investigated areas, especially in children.",

Most of the new compounds displayed improved biochemical potency against Bcl-2 and high selectivity over Bcl-xL. Specifically, compounds 27c and 34c were found to be the most potent with IC values less than 2.0\u202fnM. Unfortunately, these compounds only showed moderate antiproliferative effects against Bcl-2 dependent cells. Though further structural optimization is needed to improve the cellular absorptive permeability, the current approach represents an alternative strategy to develop novel Bcl-2 inhibitors with greater selectivity over Bcl-xL, which is related to the off-target adverse effects of venetoclax.",

The small molecule epacadostat is the most advanced IDO1 inhibitor, but its phase III trials as a single agent or in combinations with PD-1 antibody failed to show appreciable objective responses. To gain more insight on the antitumor efficacy of IDO1 inhibitors, we have designed a series of analogues of epacadostat by incorporating a cyclic aminosulfonamide moiety as the sidechain capping functionality. Compound 5a was found to display significant potency against recombinant hIDO1 and hIDO1 expressed HEK293 cancer cells. This compound has improved physico-chemical properties, acceptable PK parameters as well as optimal cardiac safety. Similar to epacadostat, 5a is ineffective as single agent in the CT-26 syngeneic xenograft model, however, the combination of 5a with PD-1 antibody showed both elevated tumor growth inhibition and prolonged median life span.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) microlens arrays are a group of micro-optics structures on curved surfaces that offer unique optical functions such as wide field of view in a compact arrangement. This paper reports an improved rapid lapping and molding system for 3D fabrication of spherical microlens arrays on non-planar surfaces including concave and convex surfaces for optical applications. Unlike traditional approaches for 3D micro patterns on curved silicon/silica substrates, this research demonstrates a low-cost and efficient chemical mechanical polishing process by lapping precision microlenses with steel balls and diamond slurries. Different from lapping on plane surfaces, lapping parameters for each micro cavity need to be accurately calculated and controlled to obtain microlenses with same apertures. Therefore, a micro wear model for micro cavity lapping process was established to calculate cavity sag height with the knowledge of down force, relative velocity and lapping time. Several groups of microlenses lapping were then conducted under the same conditions to validate the micro wear model. Guided by the micro wear model, two groups of microlens arrays were fabricated on concave and convex surfaces respectively. The shape accuracy and surface texture of the microlens arrays were evaluated by using a white light interferometer. Afterwards, the silica molds were coated with graphene film and then utilized to copy the 3D microstructures onto polymers by rapid surface molding. The wide angle imaging characterization of the 3D polymeric microlens arrays was illustrated by a simple optical setup and the measured MTF curves using the slanted-edge method. The improved manufacturing platform demonstrates a new approach for 3D microlens arrays fabrication on hard substrates in a cost effective way.",

The variation of trace elements in coal samples of different size and density were investigated. The results showed that the vertical variation of As and Hg through the seam section is the result of hydrothermal activity. Arsenic and Hg are highly concentrated in coal layers far from the parting, roof and floor in vertical section. For example, the highest concentrations of As (44.3\u00a0\u03bcg/g) and Hg (2.8\u00a0\u03bcg/g) occur in ply 6, which is 40-cm vertically away from partings. Elements As, Hg, Co, Ni, Se, Sb and Tl occur mainly in pyrite; Be, F, Cs, Th and U are evenly distributed in clay minerals and organic components; V and Cr mainly occur in the organic portions of the coal. The As and Hg content generally increases with greater particle size and density, with content in the light fractions as low as 1.1 and 0.14\u00a0\u03bcg/g, respectively, and as high as 75.8 and 3.8\u00a0\u03bcg/g, respectively, in heavy fractions. Co, Ni, Se, Sb and Tl exhibit similar density dependence. Vanadium and Cr are more concentrated in lower-density fractions.  The genetic type and mode of occurrence of elements in coal both exert a great impact on their removability; epigenetic and coarse minerals may be readily liberated by gravity separation. Elements associated with pyrite (e.g., As, Hg, Co, Ni, Cu, Se, Sb and Tl) demonstrate high removability; F, Th, U, V and Cr, which mainly occur in clay minerals and/or organic components of the coal, show a relatively low removability.

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitors that can differentiate into a variety of cell types under proper stimuli. Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is able to simultaneously induce both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs although the regulatory molecules involved remain to be fully identified and characterized. Heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1) plays an essential role not only in fat metabolism, but also in bone development. In the present study, we investigated the functional role of Hmox1 in BMP9-induced osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation in MSCs line C3H10T1/2 and probed the possible mechanism involved. We found that BMP9 promoted the endogenous expression of Hmox1 in C3H10T1/2 cells. Overexpression of Hmox1 or cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), an inducer of Hmox1, increased BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Subcutaneous stem cell implantation in nude mice further confirmed that Hmox1 potentiated BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation in vivo. In contrast, Hmox1 reduced BMP9-induced adipogenic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells. Although had no obvious effect on BMP9-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, Hmox1 enhanced phosphorylation of p38 and AKT, while decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Furthermore, Hmox1 increased total \u03b2-catenin protein level, and promoted the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in C3H10T1/2 cells. Taken together, our study strongly suggests that Hmox1 is likely to potentiate osteogenic differentiation and yet decrease adipogenic differentiation induced by BMP9 possibly through regulation of multiple signaling pathways.

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the inhibitory effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on human osteoscarcoma cell line 143B, and its possible molecular mechanism. Methods: Human osteoscarcoma 143B cells were treated with 0-50 \u03bcmol/L EGCG. Then the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of 143B cells were measured by crystal violet staining, hoechst staining, cell wound-healing and Transwell chamber assays, respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins were detected by Western blotting. The activity of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway was detected by luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of \u03b2-catenin and its downstream target molecules c-Myc and cyclin D1 were detected by Western blotting. Results: After treatment with EGCG at highly concentration, the proliferation and migration of 143B cells were significantly inhibited (both P u003c 0.05), but the proportion of apoptotic cells was markedly increased (P u003c 0.05). Compared with the EGCG-untreated group, EGCG up-regulated the expressions of caspase-3 and its cleaved protein (both P u003c 0.05), and down-regulated the expressions of Bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 proteins (all P u003c 0.05). In addition, the luciferase activity reflecting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activity in EGCG-treated group was significantly lower than that in EGCG-untreated group (P u003c 0.05). Conclusion: EGCG can inhibit the proliferation and migration of osteoscarcoma 143B cells, and promote apoptosis, which may be related to the blocking of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

        "abstract": "Taurine has been reported to influence osteogenic differentiation, but the role of taurine on cartilaginous differentiation using human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of taurine (0, 1, 5 and 10\u00a0mM) on the proliferation and chondrogenesis of hUC-MSCs by analyzing cell proliferation, accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and expression of cartilage specific mRNA. The results show though taurine did not affected the proliferation of hUC-MSCs, 5\u00a0mM of taurine is sufficient to enhanced the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and up-regulate cartilage specific mRNA expression, namely collagen type II, aggrecan and SOX9. Taurine also inhibits chondrocyte dedifferentiation by reducing expression of collagen type I mRNA. Taken together, our study reveals that taurine promotes and maintains the chondrogenesis of hUC-MSCs.",
