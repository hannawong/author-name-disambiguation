The influence of each structure parameters (volute case gap, volute throat gap, internal circumferential angle of the blade, external circumferential angle of the blade, blade numbers, the ratio of internal diameter to external diameter of the impeller or twisted angle of the blade) on the volume flow rate of the cross flow fan outlet was numerically researched. The optimal combination of seven structural parameters with the optimal performance of the cross flow fans was obtained by the orthogonal design method. Under the constant impeller external diameter and rotating speed, the optimal combination of structural parameters are as follows: volute case gap \u03b5c is 1 mm, the volute throat gap \u03b5t is 2 mm, the internal circumferential angle of the blade \u03b1 is 90\u00b0, the external circumferential angle of the blade \u03b2 is 20\u00b0, the blade numbers n is 30, the ratio of internal diameter to external diameter of the impeller \u03b3 is 0.75, and the twisted angle of the blade \u03b8 is 90\u00b0. It is obtained that the volume flow rate of the outlet of the optimized cross flow fan was increased by 25.2%. By means of the detection device of cross flow fan's performance parameters, the air outlet average velocities of the optimized and original cross flow fans were experimentally tested under the constant impeller external diameter and different impeller rotating speeds. The experimental result showed the air outlet average velocities of the optimized cross flow fan were increased by 4.6%. The theoretical calculation results were consistent with the experimental test results.",

For these features, a double-loop intelligent control based on gray ant combination prediction algorithm was presented. Firstly, the gray prediction algorithm was used to establish temperature model of gasifies. Secondly, considering possible disturbance, the ant algorithm was introduced to optimize the gray temperature model. The temperature sub-control system was based on the optimized gray temperature model. Finally, the variable universe fuzzy control algorithm was used in the oxygen content sub-control system. The gasify-air was controlled by the fuzzy rules in order to stabilize the temperature of gasifies, and reduce the oxygen content of the combustible gases. The validity and superiority was showed in the results of simulation and work site.",

        "abstract": "The essential roles of Notch pathway in angiogenesis have been reported for years. However, how Notch pathway plays its role in regulating endothelial cells remains largely unknown. In this study we found that blockade of Notch signaling with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under both normaxic and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) conditions. Abruption of ROS generation with ROS scavengers or specific inhibitors of ROS production in HUVECs abolished Notch blockade-induced HUVEC proliferation, migration and adhesion, suggesting that the regulation of Notch pathway on endothelial cell behavior is at least partially dependent on its down-regulation of ROS level. We further showed that the enhanced generation of ROS after blocking Notch signal was accompanied by augmented expression of Nox4, which led to increased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and ERK in HUVECs. In summary, our results have shown that Notch signaling regulates ROS generation by suppressing Nox4, and further modulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration and adhesion.",

        "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that initiate specific immune responses against tumor cells. Transcription factor RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling regulates DC genesis, but whether this pathway regulates DC function in anti-tumor immunity remains unclear. In the present work we attempted to identify the role of Notch signaling in DC-mediated anti-tumor immune response.When DCs were co-inoculated together with tumor cells, while the control DCs repressed tumor growth, the RBP-J deficient DCs had lost tumor repression activity. This was most likely due to that DCs with the conditionally ablated RBP-J were unable to evoke anti-tumor immune responses in the solid tumors. Indeed, tumors containing the RBP-J deficient DCs had fewer infiltrating T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells. Similarly, the draining lymph nodes of the tumors with RBP-J-/- DCs were smaller in size, and contained fewer cells of the T, B and NK lineages, as compared with the controls. At the molecular level, the RBP-J deficient DCs expressed lower MHC II, CD80, CD86, and CCR7, resulting in inefficient DC migration and T-cell activation in vitro and in vivo. T-cells stimulated by the RBP-J deficient DCs did not possess efficient cytotoxicity against tumor cells, in contrast to the control DCs.The RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling is essential for DC-dependent anti-tumor immune responses. The deficiency of RBP-J impairs the DC-based anti-tumor immunity through affecting series of processes including maturation, migration, antigen presentation and T-cell activation. The Notch signaling pathway might be a target for the establishment of the DC-based anti-tumor immunotherapies.",

        "abstract": "Notch ligands enhance ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). But to use Notch ligands in HSC therapies of human diseases, efforts are required to improve ex vivo expansion efficiency and in vivo transplant engraftment.We designed and produced an endothelium-targeted soluble Notch ligand, the DSL domain of Delta-like 1 fused with a RGD motif (D1R), and examined the effects of this protein on HSCs ex vivo and in vivo.D1R efficiently promoted ex vivo expansion of both mouse bone marrow (BM) and human umbilical cord blood HSCs. HSCs expanded with D1R up-regulated many of the stemness-related genes, and showed high BM engraftment efficacy with long-term repopulation capacity after transplantation. Moreover, in vivo administration of D1R increased the number of BM HSCs in mice, and facilitated BM recovery of mice after irradiation. Injection of D1R significantly improved HSC engraftment and myeloid recovery after BM transplantation in irradiated mice. D1R enhanced HSC engraftment not only in BM, but also in the liver and spleen after BM transplantation in mice. D1R induced the formation of compact cell clusters containing the transplanted HSCs in close contact with endothelial cells, reminiscent of HSC niches, in the liver and spleen.D1R might be applied in improving both HSC expansion ex vivo and HSC engraftment in vivo in transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated during the early reperfusion phase after ischemia, but cellular mechanisms controlling ROS production and scavenging have not been fully understood. In this study, we show that blocking Notch signal by knockout of the transcription factor RBP-J or a pharmacological inhibitor led to aggravated hepatic I/R injury, as manifested by deteriorated liver function and increased apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Interruption of Notch signaling resulted in increased intracellular ROS in hepatocytes, and a ROS scavenger cured exacerbated hepatic I/R injury after Notch signaling blockade, suggesting that Notch signal deficiency aggravated I/R injury through increased ROS levels. Notch signal blockade resulted in down-regulation of Hes5, leading to reduced formation of the Hes5-STAT3 complex and hypophosphorylation of STAT3, which further attenuated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression and increased ROS and apoptosis. Indeed, overexpression of a constitutively active STAT3 rescued MnSOD expression and I/R injury-induced apoptosis in the absence of Notch signaling. Finally, forced Notch activation by ligand stimulation or Hes5 overexpression reduced intracellular ROS and protected hepatocytes from apoptosis after I/R injury through the activation of STAT3 and MnSOD expression.Notch signal protects hepatocytes from I/R injury by Hes5-dependent activation of STAT3, which activates the expression of MnSOD, leading to the scavenging of ROS.",

        "abstract": "The LIM domain protein KyoT2 negatively regulates the Notch signaling pathway through interaction with RBP-J, the core element of the Notch signaling pathway in the nucleus. Here we show that PIAS1 (the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) interacts with KyoT2 directly and attenuates KyoT2-mediated transcriptional repression. We demonstrate that KyoT2 is modified by SUMOylation at two lysine residues, K144 and K171. SUMOylation of the transfected KyoT2 is enhanced by PIAS1 but not hPc2, another KyoT2-interacting protein with SUMO E3 ligase activity, and is repressed by a PIAS1 mutant that is deficient of E3 ligase activity. Using mutants disrupting either or both of the SUMO sites, we show that SUMOylation of KyoT2 does not influence its expression, intracellular localization, or interaction with known partners. However, disruption of the K171 SUMOylation site does reinforce the transcriptional repression activity of KyoT2, suggesting that SUMOylation of this site counters the repression activity of KyoT2. Finally, we show that PIAS1 fails to attenuate the repression activity of the K171R mutant of KyoT2, suggesting that PIAS1 may potentially antagonize the transcriptional repression activity of KyoT2 through catalyzing its SUMOylation at K171. These results suggest that KyoT2 is a substrate of SUMO modification catalyzed by PIAS1, and that SUMOylation may modulate the transcriptional repression effect of KyoT2 on the Notch/RBP-J signaling pathway.",

By constructing EGFP fusion proteins, we showed that KyoT3 locates preferentially in nucleus. KyoT3 interacted with RBP-J, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Moreover, we demonstrated by a reporter assay that KyoT3 repressed transactivation of a RBP-J-dependent promoter, which was activated by both the Notch intracellular domain and Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2, an EB virus-encoded oncoprotein.

To further understand the function and mechanism of the MINT-mediated transcription regulation, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to screen proteins that interact with the C-terminal fragment of MINT. From a cDNA library of human lymph nodes, a cDNA encoding the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH8 was identified. Using different truncated versions of MINT, we show that the C-terminal Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal domain (SPOC) domain, which has been demonstrated to mediate interactions between MINT and a panel of other molecules, might be responsible for interaction between MINT and UbcH8 in yeast, as confirmed by the beta-galactosidase assay. The interaction between MINT and UbcH8 in mammalian cells was further proved by a series of biochemical assays including the mammalian two-hybrid assay, GST pull-down assay, and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Using a reporter system, we found that MINT-mediated transcription suppression was sensitive to MG132, an inhibitor of the proteosome system. These results suggest a novel mechanism of MINT-mediated transcription regulation, and might be helpful for understanding functions of MINT.",

        "abstract": "The growth of solid tumors depends on neovascularization. Several therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis have been developed. However, poor response in some tumors and emerging resistance necessitate further investigations of new drug targets. Notch signal pathway plays a pivotal role in vascular development and tumor angiogenesis. Either blockade or forced activation of this pathway can inhibit angiogenesis. As blocking Notch pathway results in the formation of vascular neoplasm, activation of Notch pathway to prevent tumor angiogenesis might be an alternative choice. However, an in vivo deliverable reagent with highly efficient Notch-activating capacity has not been developed. Here, we generated a polypeptide, hD1R, which consists of the Delta-Serrate-Lag-2 fragment of the human Notch ligand Delta-like 1 and an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif targeting endothelial cells (ECs). We showed that hD1R could bind to ECs specifically through its RGD motif and effectively triggered Notch signaling in ECs. We demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that hD1R inhibited angiogenic sprouting and EC proliferation. In tumor-bearing mice, the injection of hD1R effectively repressed tumor growth, most likely through increasing tumor hypoxia and tissue necrosis. The amount and width of vessels reduced remarkably in tumors of mice treated with hD1R. Moreover, vessels in tumors of mice treated with hD1R recruited more NG2(+) perivascular cells and were better perfused. Combined application of hD1R and chemotherapy with cisplatin and teniposide revealed that these two treatments had additive antitumor effects. Our study provided a new strategy for antiangiogenic tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "It has been reported that blocking Notch signaling in tumor-bearing mice results in abortive angiogenesis and tumor regression. However, given that Notch signaling influences numerous cellular processes in vivo, a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of Notch inactivation on tumor growth would be favorable. In this study, we inoculated four cancer cell lines in mice with the conditional inactivation of recombination signal-binding protein-Jkappa (RBP-J), which mediates signaling from all four mammalian Notch receptors. We found that whereas three tumors including hepatocarcinoma, lung cancer, and osteogenic sarcoma grew slower in the RBP-J-deficient mice, at least a melanoma, B16, grew significantly faster in the RBP-J-deficient mice than in the controls, suggesting that the RBP-J-deficient hosts could provide permissive cues for tumor growth. All these tumors showed increased microvessels and up-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, suggesting that whereas defective angiogenesis resulted in hypoxia, different tumors might grow differentially in the RBP-J-deleted mice. Similarly, increased infiltration of Gr1(+)/Mac1(+) cells were noticed in tumors grown in the RBP-J-inactivated mice. Moreover, we found that when inoculated in the RBP-J knockout hosts, the H22 hepatoma cells had a high frequency of metastasis and lethality, suggesting that at least for H22, deficiency of environmental Notch signaling favored tumor metastasis. Our findings suggested that the general blockade of Notch signaling in tumor-bearing mice could lead to defective angiogenesis in tumors, but depending on tumor cell types, general inhibition of Notch signaling might result in tumor regression, progression, or metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Ocular neovascularization is a comprehensive process involved in retinal vascular development and several blinding diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinopathy of prematurity, with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regarded as the master regulator. However, the qualified effect of anti-VEGF therapy reveals that the underlying mechanisms are still not clearly identified. To initialize angiogenesis, endothelial cells undergo a phenotype switching to generate highly migratory and invasive cells. This process shares certain similar characters observed in endothelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Here, we found that SNAI1, an EndMT transcription factor, was expressed by endothelial cells in both physiological and pathological ocular neovascularization. SNAI1 overexpression triggered cell morphological change and enhanced cell motility, while loss of SNAI1 attenuated migration, invasion and sprouting. RNA sequence analysis further revealed that SNAI1 knockdown decreased the expression of genes related to cytoskeleton rearrangement and ECM remodeling. Moreover, intravitreal injection of small interfering RNA of SNAI1 suppressed new vessel formation in developing retina as well as mice model of choroidal neovascularization and oxygen-induced retinopathy. Therefore, we propose that the EndMT transcription factor SNAI1 promotes the early phase of ocular neovascularization and may provide a potential therapeutic target.",

It has been shown that disruption of Dll4-triggered Notch signal activation effectively inhibits tumor growth, but this treatment also results in the formation of vascular neoplasms. In this study, we investigate the effects of over-expressing Notch ligand Dll1 in B16 melanoma cells on tumor cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that over-expression of Dll1 could activate Notch signaling in tumor cells, and promote tumor cell proliferation in vitro. In contrast, growth of Dll1-over-expressing tumors in vivo was reduced, due to abnormal tumor vessel formation. Impaired tumor vasculature enhanced hypoxia and necrosis in tumor tissues, leading to retarded tumor growth. These results suggest that activation of Notch signaling may serve as an anti-angiogenesis strategy in the treatment of malignant tumors.",

        "abstract": "B cell antigen receptor (BCR) density plays a role in the differentiation of immature B cells to their mature compartments; however, the exact strategy of its influence on the development of natural autoreactive B cells is still unclear. In the present study, we explored the role of BCR surface density in autoreactive B cell development by studying two lines of mice containing distinct copy numbers of an IgH transgene with V(H) derived from a poly-reactive natural antibody 3B4. Surface BCR levels were found to be related to the transgene copy number in these mice. In mice with higher copy numbers of the transgene, the BCRs were found to promote the remaining of autoreactive B cells into marginal zone (MZ) and B-1a subsets; meanwhile, elevated surface BCR levels were correlated with a significant decrease of follicular (Fo) B cell numbers and a reduction in the number of multiple stages of immature B cells both in spleen and bone marrow (BM). Interestingly, no difference in the ratio of cell apoptosis and proliferation was found in all stages of B cell development between two lines, except that more severely aberrant proliferation of pro/pre-B cells in BM was found in mice with higher transgene copies. This data supports the idea that natural poly-reactive B cells can be positively selected into MZ and B-1 cells, and high BCR surface density favors this selection. More importantly, our data suggests that the influence by receptor expression on the differentiation of natural poly-reactive B cells begins at an early stage of B cell development.",

        "abstract": "Since Notch signaling plays a critical role in stem cells and oncogenesis, we hypothesized that Notch signaling might play roles in cancer stem cells and cancer cells with a stem cell phenotype. In this study, we accessed potential functions of the Notch pathway in the formation of cancer stem cells using human glioma. Using RT-PCR, we found that most human astrogliomas of different grades expressed moderate to high level of Notch receptors and ligands. mRNA of Hes5 but not Hes1, both of which are major downstream molecules of the Notch pathway, was also detected. In human glioma cell lines BT325, U251, SHG-44, and U87, mRNA encoding different types of Notch receptors were detected, but active form of Notch1 (NIC) was only detected in SHG-44 and U87 by Western blot. Interestingly, proliferation of these two glioma cell lines appeared faster than that of the other two lines in which NIC was not detected. We have over-expressed NIC of Notch1 in SHG-44 cells by constitutive transfection to evaluate the effects of Notch signaling on glioma cells. Our results showed that over-expression of NIC in SHG-44 cells promoted the growth and the colony-forming activity of SHG-44 cells. Interestingly, over-expression of NIC increased the formation neurosphere-like colonies in the presence of growth factors. These colonies expressed nestin, and could be induced to cells expressing neuron-, astrocyte-, or oligodendrocyte-specific markers, consistent with phenotypes of neural stem cells. These data suggest that Notch signaling promote the formation of cancer stem cell-like cells in human glioma.",

        "abstract": "Intestine is vulnerable to irradiation injury, which induces cell death and compromises regeneration of intestinal crypts. It is well accepted that cryptic stem cells, which are responsible for cryptic regeneration under physiological and pathological conditions, are controlled by multiple cell-intrinsic and environmental signals such as Notch signaling. Therefore in this study, we tested whether a soluble Notch ligand tethered to endothelial cells -- mD1R -- \u00ac\u00ac\u00acthe DSL domain of mouse Notch ligand Delta-like1 fused with a RGD motif, could protect cryptic cells from irradiation-induced intestinal injury. The result showed that administration of mD1R, which activated Notch signaling in intestinal cells, ameliorated loss of body weight and reduction of cryptic structures in intestine after total body irradiation (TBI) in mice. Histological staining showed that injection of mD1R after TBI promoted cryptic cell proliferation and reduced cell apoptosis in crypts. Immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR showed that mD1R increased the level of Lgr5, Bmi1, OLFM4, and IRIG1 in crypts, suggesting a protective effect on cryptic stem and progenitor cells after irradiation. Moreover, we found that administration of mD1R increased the number of Paneth cells and the mRNA level of Defa1, and the number Alcian blue+ Goblet cells decreased first and then increased after irradiation, suggesting that mD1R promoted the maturation of the intestinal crypt after irradiation injury. Our data suggested that mD1R could serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of irradiation-induced intestinal injury.",

        "abstract": "Sprouting angiogenesis is a major form of neovascularization of tissues suffering from hypoxia and other related stress. Endothelial cells (ECs) undergo proliferation, differentiation, programmed death, and migration during angiogenic sprouting, but the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating ECs in angiogenesis have been incompletely elucidated. Here we report that the transmembrane protein 215 (TMEM215) is involved in angiogenesis by regulating EC survival. The murine TMEM215 gene, which possesses two transcriptional starting sites as determined by 5'-rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends (RACE), encodes a two-pass TMEM. The TMEM215 transcripts were detected in ECs in addition to other tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunofluorescence showed that TMEM215 was expressed in the vasculature in retina, liver, and tumor, and colocalized with EC markers. We show that knockdown of TMEM215 in ECs induced strong cell death of ECs in vitro without affecting cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that TMEM215 was required for EC survival. Downregulation of TMEM215 expression compromised lumen formation and sprouting capacities of ECs in vitro. Moreover, intravitreous injection of TMEM215 small interfering RNA resulted in delayed and abnormal development of retinal vasculature with poor perfusion. These results identified TMEM215 as a novel molecule involved in angiogenesis by regulating the survival of ECs.",

In this study, we found that in the murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, the level of Dll3 mRNA changed upon tumor microenvironment (TME) stimulation, namely, decreased under hypoxia or stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Dll3 was also expressed at higher level in human lung carcinoma tissues than in the para-carcinoma tissues. Overexpression of Dll3 in LLC cells promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in\u00a0vitro, and enhanced tumor growth when inoculated in\u00a0vivo in mice. The Dll3-mediated proliferation could be due to increased Akt phosphorylation in LLC cells, because an Akt inhibitor counteracted Dll3-induced proliferation. Moreover, Dll3 overexpression promoted PI3K/Akt signaling through inhibiting Notch signaling.",

        "abstract": "Background Endothelial cells (ECs) form blood vessels through angiogenesis that is regulated by coordination of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Notch, transforming growth factor \u03b2, and other signals, but the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear.Methods and Results Small RNA sequencing initially identified miR\u2010342\u20105p as a novel downstream molecule of Notch signaling in ECs. Reporter assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis indicated that miR\u2010342\u20105p targeted endoglin and modulated transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling by repressing SMAD1/5 phosphorylation in ECs. Transfection of miR\u2010342\u20105p inhibited EC proliferation and lumen formation and reduced angiogenesis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, as assayed by using a fibrin beads\u2013based sprouting assay, mouse aortic ring culture, and intravitreal injection of miR\u2010342\u20105p agomir in P3 pups. Moreover, miR\u2010342\u20105p promoted the migration of ECs, accompanied by reduced endothelial markers and increased mesenchymal markers, indicative of increased endothelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. Transfection of endoglin at least partially reversed endothelial\u2013mesenchymal transition induced by miR\u2010342\u20105p. The expression of miR\u2010342\u20105p was upregulated by transforming growth factor \u03b2, and inhibition of miR\u2010342\u20105p attenuated the inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor \u03b2 on lumen formation and sprouting by ECs. In addition, VEGF repressed miR\u2010342\u20105p expression, and transfection of miR\u2010342\u20105p repressed VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 expression and VEGF\u2010triggered Akt phosphorylation in ECs. miR\u2010342\u20105p repressed angiogenesis in a laser\u2010induced choroidal neovascularization model in mice, highlighting its clinical potential.Conclusions miR\u2010342\u20105p acts as a multifunctional angiogenic repressor mediating the effects and interaction among angiogenic pathways.",

The simulation indicates that, for 3-element 1-D photonic crystal with symmetrically distributed defects, the defect thickness has little influence on the width of band gap; in the broader band gap, there is a sharp transmission peak, which will take red shift with increase of the defect thickness. Within a given range, the nonlinear relationship between wave length of the transmission peaks and defect thickness was presented, on which, FWHM of the transmission peak in band gap was calculated, furthermore, the relation graph between wave length FWHM and the defect thickness was plotted.",

        "title": "The study of the radiative lifetimes of 3pnd1F3 and 3pnd3D3 of Si I",
        "abstract": "The energy levels and lifetimes of 3 pnd 1 F 3 ( n = 3\u201315) and 3 pnd 3 D 3 ( n = 3\u201318) of neutral silicon are calculated and predicted by means of the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT). In addition, this paper corrects the assignment mistakes of 3 pnd 1 F 3 , 3 pnd 3 F 3 for n > 8, and predicts many positions and lifetime values of the energy state which are not obtained in theory and experiment up to now, and analyzes the perturbation images between the channels. OCIS 020.5870 020.2930 1 Introduction The knowledge of the radiative lifetime of excited atomic levels, especially, Rydberg states of atoms, is useful for a better understanding of the atomic structure. The lifetime together with branching ratio provides the information about transition probability, and hence oscillator strength has an important application in different branches of physics such as quantum electronics, atomic physics and spectroscopy, plasma physics and astrophysics. The silicon atom, a semiconductor element, is useful in many fields, contributing substantially to ultraviolet solar and stellar opacity through its high abundance, and rich ultraviolet spectrum. The last experiment radiative lifetimes of Si I was measured by O\u2019Brian [1] . They reported the lifetimes of 47 upper levels in natural silicon ranging in energy from 39683.16 cm \u22121 to 62802.86 cm \u22121 measured by time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence on a slow atomic beam of silicon using radiative transitions in the visible, ultraviolet, and vacuum-ultraviolet (vuv) regions between 160 and 410 nm. For the lifetimes of odd-parity J = 3 of neutral silicon, only 3pnd 1 F 3 ( n = 3\u20136) and 3pnd 3 D 3 ( n = 3\u20135) were determined, but any values of 3pnd 3 F 3 had not been given. In 2002, Coutinbo and Trigueriros [2] calculated the weighted oscillator strengths and the lifetimes of Si I spectrum by means of multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock relativistic approach, but some lifetimes of levels are disagree with experiment, and some lifetimes of levels did not be calculated. In this paper, the values of energy level and lifetime for Rydberg series 3 pnd 1 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 D 3 are calculated by the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT), and some their values for highly excited Rydberg states are predicted and the strong perturbations between the channels are discussed. 2 MQDT for lifetimes of highly excited states of atoms Multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) has been evolved into a powerful tool for the interpretation of highly excited Rydberg structure of atoms and ions [3,4] . The main idea of MQDT takes an atom or ion as a system of one excited electron and an ion core. The interaction between the excited electron and the ion core is separated into two regions: r > r 0 and r < r 0 . The wave function of r > r 0 region is a combination of Coulomb wave functions, and the wave function of r < r 0 region is described by eigenquantum defects \u03bc \u03b1 and an orthogonal transformation matrix U i\u03b1 . To ensure correct asymptotic behavior of the wave functions for discrete levels, the following condition is required: (1) det | U i \u03b1 sin \u03c0 ( \u03bd i + \u03bc \u03b1 ) | = 0 , where \u03bd i is the effective quantum number corresponding to the i th ionization limit I i . The discrete energy level E of an excited atom is given by (2) E = I i - R \u03bd i 2 , ( i = 1 , 2 \u2026 , N ) where R is the mass-connected Rydberg constant and N is the total number of dissociation channels. \u03bc \u03b1 and U i\u03b1 are essential MQDT parameters, determined by fitting experimental data on energy levels, where (3) U i \u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1 \u00af U i \u03b1 \u00af V \u03b1 \u00af \u03b1 . The U i \u03b1 \u00af matrix elements are exactly known from LS - jj transformation matrix [5] . The matrix elements V \u03b1 \u03b1 \u00af are not directly fitted; instead the orthogonal matrix V is generated by successive rotations in the ( jk ) planes as (4) V = \u220f q = 1 N ( N - 1 ) / 2 V q ( \u03b8 q ) , where V q ( \u03b8 q ) for the combination q =( j , k ) is defined in appendix B of Lee and Lu [6] , N is the number of channels. These \u03b8 jk angles are optimized and a good fit is obtained by factorizing V in the form (5) V = V 12 ( \u03b8 12 ) V 13 ( \u03b8 13 ) V 23 ( \u03b8 23 ) . No energy dependence is considered for these angles. The admixture coefficients of the wave function of a discrete energy level E n in i th channel is (6) z i ( n ) = ( - 1 ) l i + 1 ( \u03bd i , n ) 3 / 2 \u2211 \u03b1 U i \u03b1 cos \u03c0 ( \u03bd i , n + \u03bc \u03b1 ) A \u03b1 ( n ) / N n , where A \u03b1 ( n ) is the coefficient of the eigenchannel expansion and N n is a normalization factor. The MQDT normalized wave function for a highly excited state \u03c8 n at r > r 0 is represented as a superposition of the dissociation channels (the i channel) in the form (7) \u03c8 n = \u2211 i \u03d5 i p i ( n ) z i ( n ) , where p i ( n ) is the electron wave function and can be expressed in terms of the analytically known Whittaker function, and \u03d5 i denotes the wave function of the residual ion core, the spin and the angular momentum coupling in the i channel. According to reference [7,8] , the radiative decay rate of the n th level can be written as (8) \u0393 n = \u2211 i \u2211 j z i ( n ) z j ( n ) \u0393 ij ( n ) . Taking account of the dependences of \u0393 ij ( n ) on energy level ( n value) and channel ( i , j ), let (9) \u0393 ij ( n ) = ( \u03bd i ( n ) \u03bd j ( n ) ) p \u0393 ij , where \u0393 ij no longer depend on energy but on channel, and p is an adjustable parameter. Eq. (5) therefore becomes [7,8] (10) \u0393 n = \u2211 i \u2211 j z i ( n ) z j ( n ) ( \u03bd i ( n ) \u03bd j ( n ) ) p \u0393 ij . Finally, we obtain the natural lifetime of the atom in the n th excited state as (11) \u03c4 n = 1 \u0393 n . The parameters p and \u0393 ij in Eq. (11) can be determined by fitting experimental data of available lifetimes. The lifetime \u03c4 for a level n is defined as follows: (12) \u03c4 n = 1 \u2211 n A ni , So the overall spontaneous radiation transition probabilities for transitions between level n and the all possible low-lying levels i are (13) \u2211 n A ni = \u0393 n = 1 \u03c4 n . 3 Conclusions and discussion The choice of MQDT model: according to recently data on Si I [9] , only configuration 3s2p 3 3 D 3 lies under the first ionization limit, so we select 3s3p 3 3 D 3 as the perturbing states of 3 pnd 3 F 3 , 1 F 3 and 3 D 3 channel. There is a sets J = 3 odd-parity MQDT model with three ionization limits and four channels listed in Table 1 . The energies are represented by the effective quantum number in MQDT ( E \u221e1/ \u03bd 2 ) and \u03bc \u03b1 is energy-dependent. In order to calculate the energy accurately, \u03bc \u03b1 is considered to be \u03bc \u03b1 = \u03bc \u03b1 0 + 1 \u03bd 2 \u03bc \u03b1 1 + 1 \u03bd 4 \u03bc \u03b1 2 ( \u03bc \u03b1 is the function of high power of energy) and the admixture angles \u03b8 ij (see Ref. [6] ) no longer depend on energy. Using experimental energy levels from 45321.848 cm \u22121 to 65117.65 cm \u22121 given by Ref. [9] and minimizing w = \u2211 n det | U i \u03b1 sin \u03c0 ( \u03bd i \u03b1 + \u03bc \u03b1 ) | 2 N t 1 / 2 , we obtain the optimal MQDT parameters, which are listed in Table 1 . In addition, the admixture coefficients of each channel are calculated using Eq. (6) . By fitting experimental lifetimes given in Ref. [1] , we obtain the parameters of p and \u0393 ij listed in Table 2 . Using MQDT parameters obtained above, we calculate the energy levels and the admixture coefficients of highly excited states (listed in Table 3 ). Using lifetime parameters we calculate the lifetimes of 3 pnd 1 F 3 ( n = 3\u201315) and 3 pnd 3 D 3 ( n = 3\u201318) of Si I listed in Tables 3 and 4 . The admixture coefficients of 3 pnd 1 F 3 in the four channels are calculated by means of MQDT showed in Fig. 1 , meanwhile, an assignment for these excited states according to the magnitude of admixture coefficients is given in Table 3 . The energy of 3 pnd 1 F 3 is larger than that of 3 pnd 3 F 3 with the same principal quantum number because 3 pnd 1 F 3 series converge to the ionization limit Si + 2 P 3/2 (66035.00 cm \u22121 ) and 3 pnd 3 F 3 Rydberg series converge to the Si + 3 P 1/2 (65747.7 cm \u22121 ). Although the admixture coefficients of energy states 65056.95 cm \u22121 , 65226.69 cm \u22121 , 65347.10 cm \u22121 and 65528.22 cm \u22121 in channel 3 pnd 3 F 3 are higher than that in channel 3 pnd 1 F 3 , according to all our calculating results, we assign these energy states to the 3 pnd 1 F 3 series for n = 11, 12, 13 and 15, respectively. There is only one experimental energy level 3 p 9 d 3 F 3 (64351.93 cm \u22121 ) in the 3 pnd 1 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 F 3 series when n > 8 [9] . In Ref. [2] , the energy state 64351.91 cm \u22121 is assigned to 3 p 9 d 1 F 3 , but the energy values of 3 p 9 d 3 F 3 and 3 p 11 d 3 F 3 are not calculated. However, the energy of 3 p 9 d 1 F 3 given in Ref. [2] is the same as the energy of 3 p 9 d 3 F 3 given in this work, in the same way, the 3 p 11 d 1 F 3 given in Ref. [2] and 3 p 11 d 3 F 3 given in this work are the same. But the assignments of 3 pnd 3 F 3 and 3 pnd 1 F 3 for n = 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 in Ref. [2] are contrary to this work. The channels of3 pnd 3 F 3 , 3 pnd 1 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 D 3 are perturbed by the core-excited state 3 s 3 p 3 3 D 3 slightly, but the perturbation between the channel 3 pnd 3 F 3 and 3 pnd 1 F 3 is very strong, we only plot the figure of admixture coefficients of 3 pnd 1 F 3 in the first three channels (see Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 shows that the perturbation of 3 pnd 1 F 3 n = 3, 4 mainly arise from channels of 3 pnd 3 D 3 and 3 pnd 3 F 3 , but when n > 4, the main perturbation is due to channel 3 pnd 3 F 3 . However, the magnitude of admixture coefficients of 3 pnd 1 F 3 for n = 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 in channel 3 pnd 1 F 3 are less than that in the other channels, so these energy levels only have the meaning of sign. The admixture coefficients of 3 pnd 3 D 3 series in the three channels are plotted in Fig. 2 . As is shown that the perturbations of 3 p 3 d 3 D 3 , 3 p 4 d 3 D 3 and 3 p 14 d 3 D 3 arise from 3 pnd 3 F 3 and 3 pnd 1 F 3 channel are relatively strong, but for 3 p 17 d 3 D 3 , the perturbation mainly comes from channel3 pnd 3 F 3 . The radiative lifetimes and overall spontaneous radiation transition probabilities of 3 pnd 1 F 3 series calculated by MQDT are listed in Table 3 . Our results are in good agreement with the Ref. [2] except for 3 p 8 d 1 F 3 and 3 p 14 d 1 F 3 . Fig. 1 shows that the 3 pnd 1 F 3 n = 3\u20135 perturbed by 3 pnd 3 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 D 3 are so strong that the radiative lifetimes of these three states are very short, only being 3.3 ns, 6.2 ns and 10.2 ns, respectively. Although 3 p 8 d 1 F 3 is perturbed by 3 pnd 3 F 3 channel, but the perturbation that 3 p 8 d 1 F 3 be subjected to is more less than that of the lowly excited states 3 p 4 d 1 F 3 and 3 p 5 d 1 F 3 , and the principal quantum number is 8, it is impossible for the lifetime of 3 p 8 d 1 F 3 to equals 1.492 ns given by Ref. [2] and it must be lager than the lifetime of 3 p 7 d 1 F 3 . Accordingly, the lifetime of 3 p 8 d 1 F 3 is 40.7 ns has certain reliability. Moreover, the perturbation that 3 p 11 d 1 F 3 , 3 p 13 d 1 F 3 and 3 p 15 d 1 F 3 be subjected to is more than that of their previous energy states, so their lifetimes are less than that of their previous states. The radiative lifetimes and overall spontaneous radiation transition probabilities of 3 pnd 3 D 3 are listed in Table 4 . Since3 p 3 d 3 D 3 , 3 p 4 d 3 D 3 are perturbed by channel 3 pnd 1 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 F 3 strongly, so their lifetimes are relatively short. But the 3 pnd 3 D 3 n = 6\u201313 are perturbed by channel 3 pnd 1 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 F 3 weakly, and in this energy range, the lifetimes of 3 pnd 3 D 3 are in direct proportion to \u03bd 3 ( \u03bd is the effective quantum number). So it is impossible that the lifetime of 3 p 9 d 3 D 3 becomes large abruptly (the lifetime of 3 p 9 d 3 D 3 in Ref. [2] is 113.10 ns). In the same way, the lifetimes of 3 p 14 d 3 D 3 and 3 p 17 d 3 D 3 becomes short because their perturbations come from 3 pnd 1 F 3 and 3 pnd 3 F 3 are relatively strong. As a result of no experimental lifetime values for 3 pnd 3 F 3 Rydberg series as yet, the theoretical values are not calculated in this work. This paper corrects the assignment mistakes of 3 pnd 1 F 3 , 3 pnd 3 F 3 for n > 8, and predicts a lot of positions and lifetime values of the energy state which are not obtained in theory and experiment up to now, and analyzes the perturbation images between the channels.

The close-coupling expansion includes thirty-four target states of N V with the thirteen configurations in the LS-coupling scheme. The resonance energies and widths of eighteen series of autoionization are determined from QB method and agree with these by cross sections. Our theoretical resonance energies, widths are compared with existing experiments on the Auger spectra and other theoretical results. The calculated resonance energies are in rather good agreement with the experiment on the Auger spectra. For the autoionization width of some resonance states, good agreement is also found with recent theoretical results wherever available obtained using a saddle-point complex-rotation method.",

        "abstract": "One-dimensional photonic crystals with periodic structure have been limited to only one direction in space and have been around for quite a long time in the very fertile field of thin film optics. Our periodic many-layered thin film (1-D Photonic Crystal) model consists of two types of layered medium in which one layer has gain. The optical properties of transmission and reflection are studied in this 1-D Photonic Crystal with gain. The relationship of transmission coefficient with wavelength, gain and the thickness of media, and the relational expression of critical length with gain are all obtained by using the transfer-matrix method. The mode of divergence points of transmission coefficient depend on the gain, thickness and thickness of monolayer media are analyzed, and it is compared with the Fabry-Perot (F-P) system. It is found that the gain suppress the transmission and the media will be equivalent to a reflector when the gain is large. These simulated calculations are valuable in the design of optical device based on photonic crystal.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was explore the effect of natural killer (NK) cells on engraftment and reconstitution of hematopoiesis and immunity in mice undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Lethally and nonlethally irradiated BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice were transplanted with C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) bone marrow plus donor peripheral T cells and/or NK cells. Recipient CD34(+), H-2K(b+), CD3(+) and CD19(+) cells were detected by flow cytometry; peripheral blood leukocytes were counted by auto-cytometry; survival rates, engraftment, hematopoietic and immune recovery of recipients in different transplant groups were then observed. The results indicated that as compared with lethally irradiated and allo-BMT group without infusion of NK cells, the survival rate in lethally irradiated and allo-BMT group with infusion of NK cells significantly enhanced (survival rates at 60 days were 70% and 0.0% respectively); leukocyte count, expression level of CD19(+) cell and CD34(+) cell count recovered rapidly; expression level of H-2K(b+) cells obviously increased [(86.68 +/- 4.45)% vs (4.68 +/- 0.32)%]; expression level of CD3(+) cell at day 28 after transplantation obviously decreased [(33.69 +/- 3.36)% vs (50.40 +/- 5.06)%, p < 0.01], at day 60 there was not significant difference between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). In nonlethally irradiated and allo-BMT group without NK cell infusion, the expression level of H-2K(b+) at day 30 after transplantation significantly decreased, and reduced to level before transplantation at day 60; while expression of H-2K(b+) yet could be detected with > 80% at day 60 after transplantation in group infused with high and low concentration of NK cells. It is concluded that in allo-BMT mice, alloreactive NK cell inhibits graft rejection, enhances engraftment, promotes the reconstitution of hematopoiesis and immunity, and increases survival rates.",

Objective: To study HL-60 cell-line apoptosis induced by genistein and the effects of genistein on the expression of Bcl-2, c-Myc, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and to discuss the action mechanism of genistein. Design, time and setting: The cell molecular biology control experiment was performed at the Research Room of Hematologic Disease of Guangdong Medical College from March 2006 to September 2007. Materials: Human premyelocyte leukemic cell line HL-60 was obtained from China Center for Type Culture Collection. Methods: HL-60 cells were treated with 0.1 mmol/L, 0.5 mmol/L and 1.0 mmol/L genistein for 12 - 16 hours; apoptotic cells were observed by microscope; DNA fragmentation was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The percentage of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry after the HL-60 cells were stained with Propidium Iodide, and the expression levels of Bcl-2, c-Myc, and PCNA were detected by flow cytometry after the HL-60 cells were incubated with fluorescence conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Main outcome measures: Morphological changes in HL-60 cells after apoptosis; percentage of apoptosis in HL-60 cells; expression levels of Bcl-2, c-Myc and PCNA. Results: HL-60 cell showed apoptotic morphology, including nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic body under a microscope after treatment with genistein for 12-16 hours. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed DNA fragmentation. The percentage of apoptosis cell increased, and the expression levels of Bcl-2, c-Myc, and PCNA decreased obviously in HL-60 cells treated with 0.1-1.0 mmol/L genistein, and the effects appeared in a dose-dependence. Conclusion: Genistein induces HL-60 cell apoptosis by inhibiting expression levels of Bcl-2 and c-Myc. The HL-60 apoptosis can result in down-regulation of PCNA.",

(Eur J  Oper Res 235(1): 206\u2013214, 2014) proposed a novel approach for allocating the fixed cost based on the game cross-efficiency method by taking the game relations among users in efficiency evaluation. This paper proves that the novel approach of Du et al. (Eur J  Oper Res 235(1): 206\u2013214, 2014) is equivalent to the efficiency maximization approach of Li et al. (Omega 41(1): 55\u201360, 2013), and may exist multiple optimal cost allocation plans. Taking into account the game relations in the allocation process, this paper proposes a cooperative game approach, and uses the nucleolus as a solution to the proposed cooperative game. The proposed approach in this paper is illustrated with a dataset from the prior literature and a real dataset of a steel and iron enterprise in China.",

This paper proposes two new fuzzy DEA models constructed from the perspective of fuzzy arithmetic to deal with fuzziness in input and output data in DEA.

Specifically, the supplier invests in ingredient branding to build up her goodwill and additionally she shares a portion of the OEMs advertising cost through a cooperative advertising programme. Under a differential game framework, we obtain the equilibrium advertising efforts of the supplier and OEM, and the suppliers equilibrium subsidy rate for the cooperative advertising programme. We further extend the model to the case in which the OEM procures two complementary components from two suppliers. We consider three different scenarios of supplier interaction, i.e. The suppliers are (I) independent, (II) allied and keep two brands and (III) allied and keep one brand. We demonstrate how the different interactions between suppliers affect the channel members advertising efforts, goodwill levels and their profits. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

Various efficiency evaluation models are presented to calculate the efficiencies of the two sub-stages in a way that is most preferable by one of the sub-stages, wherein the upper and lower bounds of the efficiencies are explicitly determined. A transformation is proposed to transfer a non-linear cooperative model into a linear one by setting one of the two-stage efficiencies as a parameter. A heuristic parametric linear programming is suggested to solve the cooperative model.",

This article proposes a method to identify three growth models: the Damped Exponential Model, the Normal Model, and the Fluctuating Model. This method is proven to be valid using the 112 disasters occurring between 2003 and 2008. The factors that influence the likelihood of the growth models include disaster types, newsworthy material, disaster severity, and economic development of the affected area. This article suggests that disaster decision-makers can identify the respective likelihood of the three growth models of news stories when a disaster happens, and thereby implement effective measures in response to the disaster situation. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

For example, DMUs may consist of subunits or represent two-stage processes. One particular subset\n of such processes is those in which all the outputs from the first stage are the only inputs to the second stage. This chapter\n first reviews these models and discusses relations among various approaches. Our focus here is the approaches based upon either\n Stackelberg (leader\u2013follower) or cooperative game concepts. We then examine the more general problem of an open multistage\n process where some outputs from a given stage may leave the system while others become inputs to the next stage.

Companies usually conduct M&A to preserve or extend their competitive advantages. However, M&As usually fail in real life. For the given bidder company, a critical step to the success of M&A activities is the appropriate selection of target companies. Previous studies rarely considered the profile of the bidder company and its compatibility with candidate target companies. Although data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been applied in M&A, previous studies in this area haven't discussed the selection. In this paper, DEA was applied to support the decision making of mergers and acquisitions for decision making units (DMUs), i.e., the companies. We established a greedy algorithm to implement the selection process. This approach can make up the deficiencies of previous studies in some degree because it considers bidder and target company simultaneously. \u00a9 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Co-operative advertising, which usually occurred in the vertical supply chain, is a typically cost sharing and promotion mechanism for manufacturer to affect retailers' performances. However, previous cooperative advertising literatures ignores an important effect of advertising, i.e., reference price effect, which reflects the impact of reference price on demand. In this paper, we propose a dynamic cooperative advertising model with the reference price effect under Nerlove-Arrow model framework, then formulae both the advertising effect and reference-price effect into the demand function and analyze the optimal advertising decisions of manufacturer and retailer. New results show some differences from the previous researches, including: (i) in Nash Game, manufacturer's national advertising effort is positive correlated to retailer's marginal profit while retailer's advertising effort is positive correlated to manufacturer's marginal profit which is contradict with the results in previous literatures; (ii) the steady reference price is higher than market price in any cooperative advertising mechanism while most of previous researches show reference price tend to be equal to market price as time goes by.",

Specifically, we recommend two options for cooperation for the theme park and the tour operator: (a) direct purchase mode (DPM): the tour operators purchase tickets directly from the theme park at the beginning of the cooperation period; (b) ticket exchange voucher mode (TEVM): the tour operator can receive ticket exchange vouchers rather than tickets by paying a deposit to the theme park at the beginning of the cooperation period. A ticket exchange voucher is an option that can be executed or withdrawn. Based on our observations of the industry, we model the two options described above as a decentralized decision-making system with the theme park being the Stackelberg leader. In addition, a coordination mechanism is designed under which the tourism supply chain profit is attained at the same level as in the centrally coordinated system. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

In this paper, we proposed a new advertising response model based on consumer population dynamics. Considering that the population dynamics is one of the basic characteristics of consumers, we try to apply it in describing the effects of advertising. In detail, a two-level framework advertising response model is introduced in this paper, in which the general Lotka-Volterra model is used to describe population dynamics among consumers and another increasing function is utilised to reflect the advertisement's effect on the intrinsic sales growth rate of a product or a brand. Mathematic analysis shows that the new advertising model has more advantages than other classic models such as Vidale-Wolfe model, Nerlove-Arrow model, Lanchester model and their modifications. Also, an early-warning marketing mechanism is introduced as an application of the proposed model. Copyright \u00a9 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, environmental problems caused by industries in China have drawn increasing attention to both academics and policy makers. This paper assesses the environmental efficiency of Chinese regional industrial systems to come up with some recommendations to policy makers. First, we divided each Chinese regional industrial system into a production process and a pollutant treatment process. Then, we built a scientific input\u2013intermediate\u2013output index system by introducing a new network slacks-based model (NSBM) model. This study is the first to combine NSBM with DEA window analysis to give a dynamic evaluation of the environmental efficiency. This enables us to assess the environmental efficiency of Chinese regional industrial systems considering their internal structure as well as China\u2019s policies concerning resource utilization and environmental protection. Hence, the overall efficiency of each regional industrial system is decomposed into production efficiency and pollutant treatment efficiency. Our empirical results suggest: (1) 66.7% of Chinese regional industrial systems are overall inefficient. 63.3 and of 66.7% Chinese regional industrial systems are inefficient in the production process and the pollutant treatment process, respectively. (2) The efficiency scores for the overall system and both processes are all larger in the eastern area of China than those of the central and western areas. (3) Correlation analysis indicates that SO2 generation intensity (SGI), solid waste generation intensity, COD discharge intensity, and SO2 discharge intensity have significantly negative impacts on the overall efficiency. (4) The overall inefficiency is mainly due to inefficiency of the pollutant treatment process for the majority of regional industrial systems. (5) In general, the overall efficiency was trending up from 2004 to 2010, indicating that the substantial efforts China has devoted to protecting the environment have yielded benefits.",

However, conventional DEA-related ranking approaches are based on the self-evaluation efficiencies, each DMU chooses its most favorite weights, and the resulted efficiencies have little meaning as ranking base. Therefore this paper advances a ranking technique based on the weight set which is favorable for all DMUs' efficiencies and can narrow the gap between evaluation efficiencies and self-evaluation efficiencies. In order to have a reasonable and acceptable ranking result, cross efficiency is being used for its advantages. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a numerical example.",

        "abstract": "Mobile platforms are prevalently used in the age of social media. They serve a two-sided market to connect users and app developers. In this system, members simultaneously sell products, publish advertisements (ads), and advertise. This paper aims to explore advertising strategies for the mobile platform incorporating their roles as sellers, ad publishers, and advertisers. Specifically, we develop a game-theoretical model which captures the relationship among the works of the platform owner and app developers in a dynamic setting. Our analysis shows that when the platform displays apps\u2019 ads, the owner may be better off to participate in apps\u2019 advertising under certain conditions, rather than always charging them aggressively as suggested by convention wisdom. Surprisingly, although the negative impacts evoked by multiple apps\u2019 entry deserve much attention, it is unnecessary for app developers to take into account when making advertising decisions. We further find that the coordinating bilateral participation in advertising is a new mechanism to improve the profitability. Unlike the result proposed in the previous literature, the mechanism here will cause free-riding among app developers when they participate in the platform\u2019s advertising. Furthermore, when accompanied with the revenue sharing policy, the relatively low participation rates could absolutely eliminate the system inefficiency.",

        "title": "Impact of demand uncertainty on supply chain cooperation of single-period products",
        "abstract": "Cooperation is an approach of improving competitive advantages of a supply chain. A two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer for a single-period product is studied, and retail-market demand uncertainty is described by coefficient of variation. We develop a cooperation mechanism to address the cooperation and its implementation between the manufacturer and the retailer, two market situations are considered: (i) the wholesale price and the order quantity are decision variables, (ii) the wholesale and the retail prices as well as the order quantity are decision variables. In both market situations, our research shows that: (1) the cooperation mechanism can improve the overall channel profits and the supply chain members' allocated profits, (2) the described cooperation is conditional on retail-market demand uncertainty: it can be implemented if, and only if, the fluctuation of retail-market demand is relatively small and coefficient of variation of retail-market demand does not exceed an upper bound. Impacts of retail-market demand uncertainty on wholesale price, order quantity and/or retail price have also been investigated through analytical and numerical analyses. Although our research is based on the assumption that the manufacturer dominates the supply chain in the non-cooperative situation, which is not the case for most retailer-driven supply chains, this research is still significant on providing guidelines for practitioners in current China mid-level car market that is similar to situations described in the paper. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Two models are proposed to evaluate the performance of this type general two-stage network structures. One is a non-linear centralized model whose global optimal solutions can be estimated using a heuristic search procedure.

        "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that data envelopment analysis (DEA) lacks discrimination power to distinguish between DEA efficient units. This paper proposes a new methodology for ranking decision making units (DMUs). The new methodology ranks DMUs by imposing an appropriate minimum weight restriction on all inputs and outputs, which is decided by a decision maker (DM) or an assessor in terms of the solutions to a series of linear programming (LP) models that are specially constructed to determine a maximin weight for each DEA efficient unit. The DM can decide how many DMUs to be retained as DEA efficient in final efficiency ranking according to the requirement of real applications, which provides flexibility for DEA ranking. Three numerical examples are investigated using the proposed ranking methodology to illustrate its power in discriminating between DMUs, particularly DEA efficient units.",

        "abstract": "In a supply chain, several plants produce one kind of product jointly, each of which makes plan autonomously. Hence, in order to minimize the total cost of the supply chain, a strategy is needed to coordinate the plant plans. ATC (analytical target cascading) is considered more suitable for such distributed planning environment. Each plan outsources some components to produce the product, so sub models are built in ATC model for plant to negotiate component supply plans with suppliers and select supplier, according to production plan. The numerical study in this paper demonstrates (1) ATC is an efficient method for coordinating the distributed production planning by comparing ATC with AAO (all at once) method, (2) the negotiation model is powerful in negotiation with suppliers and supplier selection.",

Standard data envelopment analysis models can evaluate the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) and distinguish efficient ones from inefficient ones. However, when there are more than one efficient DMU, it is impossible to rank all of them solely according to standard efficiency scores. In this paper, a new method for fully ranking all DMUs is proposed, which is based on the combination of each efficient DMU's influence on all the other DMUs and the standard efficiency scores. This method is effective in helping decision makers differentiate all units' performance thoroughly and select the best performer. \u00a9 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The financing of supply chains involves decisions by supply chain members as well as by lending institutions. The optimality of lending decisions in this environment depends on the loss aversion on the part of supply chain members as well as the availability of capital. The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of capital constraint and loss aversion on operational decisions in supply chains. Traditional models have the bank external to the supply chain, with the bank's interest rate exogenous. This research concerns a capital-constrained supply chain with the manufacturer selling to a loss averse newsvendor-like retailer, and a bank financing both the manufacturer and the retailer. The existence of supply chain finance equilibrium is proven by the use of Stackelberg game analysis. The best pricing and ordering decisions of both manufacturer and retailer are determined, and results demonstrate how these key decisions are influenced by their initial capital and the bank's financial decisions. For instance, the optimal order quantity increases or decreases with initial capital, and it is interesting that bankruptcy protection encourages a cash-constrained retailer to adopt an aggressive ordering strategy. Moreover, it is shown that the retailer's loss aversion has a significant impact on the capital constraint problem. With an increase in loss aversion, the required initial working capital decreases. Loss aversion can even change the retailer's situation from one of capital constraint to one of capital sufficiency. An extension with double orders is given for comparison. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the impact of initial capital and loss aversion on the optimal decisions and some other managerial insights are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Production in large organizations with a centralized decision-making environment like supermarket chains or factories with many workshops, usually involves the participation of more than one individual unit, each contributing a part of the total production. This study is motivated by a production-planning problem regularly faced by the central decision-making unit to arrange new input and output plans for all individual units in the next production season when demand changes can be forecasted. Two planning ideas have been proposed in this paper. One is optimizing the average or overall production performance of the entire organization, measured by the CCR efficiency of the average input and output levels of all units. The other is simultaneously maximizing total outputs produced and minimizing total inputs consumed by all units. According to these two ideas, we develop two DEA-based production planning approaches to find the most preferred production plans. All these individual units, considered as decision-making units (DMUs), are supposed to be able to modify their input usages and output productions. A simple numerical example and a real world data set are used to illustrate these approaches. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "For network models widely used in dealing with complex organizations and issues, the performance measurement of the system with multiple processes and multiple sub-systems is of great importance and necessity. DEA has strongly proven to be an applicable and practical method to evaluate the efficiency of DMU. However, the conventional DEA model ignores the inner structure and process of a larger DMU, leading to limitations in application. With the exertion on the extension of the conventional DEA to adapt more complicated and interactive multiple sub-DMUs, some researchers developed two-stage or more intricate network DEA model to evaluate the performance of some special firms or organizations. Moreover, cooperative and non-cooperative game theory was steered to manage the relationship among sub-DMUs, and cooperative efficiency was proceeded to match the actual instance well. Further, this paper devotes to find more appropriate efficiency to depict the firms with cooperative sub-firms. Several new models are presented to calculate the efficiency of the sub-DMUs in a non-cooperative manner, whereby the upper and lower bounds of the efficiencies are explicitly determined. A geometric average cooperative DEA model is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of the DMUs, and a heuristic parametric linear programming is suggested to solve the cooperative model. The model is justified by a numerical evaluation of the bank performance. Copyright \u00a9 (2008) by Computers & Industrial Engineering.",

The growing concerns over environmental problems make China reconsider the current developing pattern, and partially necessitate the reformation of economic structure. If the environmental consequences from economic structure reformation are subject to empirical testing, it is of vital importance to make some actual measurement for environmental performance. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a slacks-based environmental efficiency index based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). An empirical application to industry sector of China presents the following findings: (1) approximately two-thirds of the nation\u2019s provinces are inefficient due to excessive resource utilization, insufficient products or considerable quantities of wastes; (2) Spearman test shows that SO and solid waste intensity have more impacts on industrial aggregated efficiency than those of electricity and COD intensity do, which implies that waste gas and solid waste should be paid more attention in pollution abatement; (3)\u00a0the environmental protection activities have yielded the expected benefits, as the aggregated efficiency of regional industry has been on a rising trend during the past decade; (4)\u00a0the west region of China has been developing quickly in recently years and performs well both in economy and environmental control.",

It first examines the basic concept of equity of the proportional sharing method in the one dimensional case which motivates the analysis and extends proportional sharing to the general multiple-input multiple-output case. Then, it has proven that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the proportional sharing is that all users can be DEA efficient with a common set of weights. Furthermore, this paper investigates the relationship between the extended proportional sharing method and some other DEA-based allocation approaches. Based upon these theoretical foundations, this paper proposes an alternative cost allocation approach, and applies it to a data set from prior DEA literature.",

        "abstract": "Fast deteriorating raw materials such as raw milk, fruit and vegetables are commonly used to produce slowly deteriorating finished products such as milk powders, cheeses, and pastas. This paper studies a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) type supply chain where the manufacturing vendor decides how to manage the system-wide inventories of its fast deteriorating raw material and its slowly deteriorating product. The decision variables are a common replenishment cycle of the product and the replenishment frequency of the raw material. We assume the deteriorating rates are known constants and every retailers demand is deterministic. We develop an integrated model to calculate the total inventory and deterioration cost for such a system. We prove the convexity of the cost functions, and based on this a golden search algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution of the model. Our numerical results show that the deteriorating rate of the product may increase the total cost by more than 40% compared to the zero-deteriorating rate, while the deteriorating raw material has less impact on the total cost (commonly less than 5% in our numerical examples). This indicates that more attention should be paid to the product than the raw material. Further, an increase in the number of retailers can make the replenishment frequency of the raw material increase significantly but the common replenishment cycle of the product decreases a little. This indicates that adding a new retailer would not be felt strongly by the other retailers but would be felt by the supplier of the raw material. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Fixed cost and resource allocation based on DEA cross-efficiency.",
        "abstract": "In many managerial applications, situations frequently occur when a fixed cost is used in constructing the common platform of an organization, and needs to be shared by all related entities, or decision making units (DMUs). It is of vital importance to allocate such a cost across DMUs where there is competition for resources. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been successfully used in cost and resource allocation problems. Whether it is a cost or resource allocation issue, one needs to consider both the competitive and cooperative situation existing among DMUs in addition to maintaining or improving efficiency. The current paper uses the cross-efficiency concept in DEA to approach cost and resource allocation problems. Because DEA cross-efficiency uses the concept of peer appraisal, it is a very reasonable and appropriate mechanism for allocating a shared resource/cost. It is shown that our proposed iterative approach is always feasible, and ensures that all DMUs become efficient after the fixed cost is allocated as an additional input measure. The cross-efficiency DEA-based iterative method is further extended into a resource-allocation setting to achieve maximization in the aggregated output change by distributing available resources. Such allocations for fixed costs and resources are more acceptable to the players involved, because the allocation results are jointly determined by all DMUs rather than a specific one. The proposed approaches are demonstrated using an existing data set that has been applied in similar studies. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses mechanisms for the allocation of emission permits (AEP) among a group of manufacturing companies aiming at controlling the total emission level of the group. Data envelopment analysis is adopted and extended to construct the AEP models. Proposed methods allocate the permits on the basis of the current input and output levels of individual firms, rather than historical records. Two variations of AEP mechanisms are considered. One situation is that one of the member firms dominates the responsibility of allocating emission permits on behalf of the group (individual AEP scenario). This dominating firm will maximise its own emission permit before allocating permits among other members in the group. The other situation is that a third-party central governing body is centrally responsible for coordinating the AEP among all group members (Central AEP scenario). Proposed mechanisms are applied to analyse efficiencies of a group of paper mills. The result shows that the mode of central AEP mechanism is a better choice than that of the individual AEP mechanism. Central AEP not only maximises the whole efficiency of the group but also improves efficiencies of individual firms. In contrast, with individual AEP, one firm gains efficiency at the loss of others. ? 2013 Taylor and Francis.",

        "title": "Optimal selection of retailers for a manufacturing vendor in a vendor managed inventory system.",
        "abstract": "A Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) system consists of a manufacturing vendor and a number of retailers. In such a system, it is essential for the vendor to optimally determine retailer selection and other related decisions, such as the product's replenishment cycle time and the wholesale price, in order to maximize his profit. Meanwhile, each retailer's decisions on her willingness to enter the system and retail price are simultaneously considered in the retailer selection process. However, the above interactive decision making is complex and the available studies on interactive retailer selection are scarce. In this study, we formulate the retailer selection problem as a Stackelberg game model to help the manufacturer, as a vendor, optimally select his retailers to form a VMI system. This model is non-linear, mixed-integer, game-theoretic, and analytically intractable. Therefore, we further develop a hybrid algorithm for effectively and efficiently solving the developed model. The hybrid algorithm combines dynamic programming (DP), genetic algorithm (GA) and analytical methods. As demonstrated by our numerical studies, the optimal retailer selection can increase the manufacturer's profit by up to 90% and the selected retailers' profits significantly compared to non-selection strategy. The proposed hybrid algorithm can solve the model within a minute for a problem with 100 candidate retailers, whereas a pure GA has to take more than 1 h to solve a small sized problem of 20 candidate retailers achieving an objective value no worse than that obtained by the hybrid algorithm. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We considered a supply chain system that includes a supplier and multi retailers; they all adopt order-up-to approach to control inventories. Retailers faced stochastic demand and shared their inventories among each other-a retailer would transship residual stocks to other retailers which faced residual demand after demand realized. Based on the traditional hypothetical conditions, we developed a mix 0-1 programming model under system total cost minimization objective. Because of the stochastic vectors in the model, we covert the model to a stochastic expected value programming model, designed a heuristic algorithm that combined stochastic quasi gradient algorithm (SQGA) with genetic algorithm (GA), and explained the solution procedure. Numerical examples showed the efficiency of the model and algorithm. Besides, we investigated the case of coefficient demand and the case of violation of traditional transshipment conditions. Numerical results show that this model and algorithm is considerably effective in determining the optimal order-up-to points in supply chain system with retailers' lateral transshipment existence.",

This problem-oriented new DEA model can simultaneously assess the production and investment performance of insurers, differing from classical DEA models appropriate for independent performance evaluation. The mathematical solution is provided for this new model and the results show that the Canadian L&H insurance companies operated very efficiently for the examined 3-year period (1996-1998). In addition, no scale efficiency in the Canadian L&H insurance industry is found in this study. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, integrating remanufacturing into manufacturing operation complicate the problem. Most of literatures concentrate on optimal policy of hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system just considering return rate, but without considering collection effort of returns. More returns will reduce cost greatly for lower remanufacturing cost, but which will increase the expenditure to collect returns. This paper takes the collection effort of returns into the hybrid system decision. This paper assumes that remanufactured product is as good as newly manufactured product and manufacturing leadtimes and remanufacturing leadtimes are equal to zero. If the decision of minimizing cost considering investment of return is made in a single period, there will no investment of returns. So we formulate a multi-period planning horizon model to minimize the total cost of manufacturing cost, remanufacturing cost and investment of collection returns, which seeks the tradeoff between manufacturing and remanufacturing operation.,,.

        "abstract": "As an extension to data envelopment analysis (DEA), cross-efficiency evaluation not only provides a ranking among the decision-making units (DMUs) but also eliminates unrealistic DEA weighting schemes without requiring a priori information on weight restrictions. A factor that possibly reduces the usefulness of the cross-efficiency evaluation method is that the cross-efficiency scores may not be unique due to the presence of alternate optima. As a result, it is recommended that secondary goals be introduced in cross-efficiency evaluation. This paper seeks to extend the model of Doyle and Green [1994. Efficiency and cross efficiency in DEA: Derivations, meanings and the uses. Journal of the Operational Research Society 45 (5), 567\u2013578], by introducing a number of different secondary objective functions. The models are illustrated with examples.",

        "abstract": "Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been proven an effective tool for performance evaluation and benchmarking, which can provide a relative efficiency measure for peer decision making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and outputs. Nevertheless, its flexibility in weighted inputs and weighted outputs as well as its nature of self-evaluation has been criticized. The cross-evaluation method is developed as a DEA extensive tool being utilized to identify the best practice DMUs and to rank all DMUs using cross-efficiency scores that are associated with all DMUs, however, it still seems imperfect since the non-uniqueness of cross-efficiency measure possibly derogates the practicability of this method, and especially, the average cross-efficiency measure is not a Pareto one, so not all DMUs have the motivation to accept it. In this paper, we adopt a Nash bargaining game to improve the usual cross efficiency evaluation method. In the game, each DMU will be an independent player, and the bargaining solution between CCR efficiency and cross-efficiency can be obtained by using the classical Nash bargaining game model. The advantage of the bargaining efficiency lies on that it is a Pareto one and all the DMUs will have motivation to accept it, as well as that the adoption of common weights in evaluation will result in the equitableness of ranking all DMUs. Finally, the comparisons of those efficiency scores mentioned above and the corresponding weights are demonstrated by an example of R&D project selection.",

        "abstract": "How to allocate initial emission permits is vital for the cap-and-trade system in controlling the total emission level and improving the operation efficiency of the trade mechanism. And data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been proved to be more suitable to fairly resolve the problem as a performance-based allocation is involved here. In this paper, we present a novel DEA approach for fair reduction and reallocation of emission permits for areas under administration. The presented DEA models are based on the ideas, where, according to their eco-efficiency and current emission levels, all decision making units (DMUs) compete with each other for the least reduction amount by introducing a bargaining game, on the other hand, the central authority can improve the overall efficiency by reallocating the remaining emission permits. The approach is applied on the dataset of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from 15 European Union members (EU15). The results of the application show that the reduction and reallocation mechanism is fair, which benefits the countries that work at the optimal scale operation while punishes those that fail to operate on the optimal scale. Furthermore, it is effective in improving the overall efficiency of the system. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In order to decrease the long customer queue at counters, a bank increases the lower withdrawal limit and/or the upper one. Through a finite-source queue model, this paper analyzes the effects of the lower and/or upper limits on the length of customer queue at counters. Main conclusions are: (1) A bank may simultaneously shorten the queue at counters and improve satisfaction level of customers by increasing the withdrawal limit through an ATM and/or the one through a bank teller and ameliorating waiting environment; (2) The length of the queue at counters decreases with the number of the customers who are free in selecting service provider, bank teller or ATM. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been popularly applied in this field. In this paper, we propose some new DEA models, which consider both economic and environmental factors in the allocation of a given resource. Three scenarios of the given resource in the next period will be considered: one is larger than that in the present period, another is smaller than that in this period and the third is equal to that in this period. Two objective functions are formulated for the three scenarios, i.e., maximizing the total desirable outputs and minimizing the total undesirable outputs. The approach retains the advantages of traditional DEA, unit-invariant property, objectively-determined weights of inputs and outputs, and perfect dealing with multi-inputs and multi-outputs. An example is also employed to illustrate the approach. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have applied backpropagation feedforward neural networks (BPNNs) as an alternative to multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) in attempts to predict business distress using relatively small data sets. Although these studies have generally reported the superiority of BPNNs vs. MDA, they seem to ignore the fact that the former suffers from overfitting if the data set is too small compared to the free parameters of the network. We thus suggest an alternative approach that involves use of a probabilistic neural network (PNN). From our study of financially distressed Chinese public companies, we found that both the PNN and MDA algorithms provide good classifications. Relative to MDA, however, the PNN method provides better prediction, and, at the same time, does not require multivariate normality of the data. Our results appear to offer an improvement from those of earlier efforts that employ MDA, BPNN, and other models. In particular, PNN was here able to predict company distress with greater than 87.5% short-term accuracy, and 81.3% medium-term accuracy. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, we then point out that the main drawback of the method lies in non-uniqueness of cross-efficiency scores resulted from the presence of alternate optima in traditional DEA models, obviously making it become less effective. Aiming at the research gap, a weight-balanced DEA model is proposed to lessen large differences in weighted data (weighted inputs and weighted outputs) and to effectively reduce the number of zero weights for inputs and outputs. Finally, we use two examples of the literature to illustrate the performance of this approach and discuss some issues of interest regarding the choosing of weights in cross-efficiency evaluations.",

Assurance regions (ARs) have been used to further refine the DEA results. These AR DEA models assume that ARs apply uniformly across all nations. Such models can have shortcomings in the sense that different nations may impose different ARs, as nations may value gold, silver, and bronze medals differently. This paper extends previous DEA studies by incorporating multiple sets of nation-specific ARs into the DEA. By doing so, we establish fair models for measuring and benchmarking the performance of nations at six summer Olympic Games.",

The manufacturer determines wholesale price, inventory replenishment cycle, and backorder quantity by maximizing its own profit with sufficient capacity. The retailers in turn take the manufacturer's decision results as given inputs to determine the optimal retail prices to maximize their own profits. This problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer is the leader and retailers are followers. The analysis of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game and its corresponding algorithm are given. A numerical study is conducted to understand the influence of some parameters.",

        "title": "DEA game cross-efficiency approach to Olympic rankings",
        "abstract": "A number of studies have used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the performance of the countries in Olympic games. While competition exists among the countries in Olympic games/rankings, all these DEA studies do not model competition among peer decision making units (DMUs) or countries. These DEA studies find a set of weights/multipliers that keep the efficiency scores of all DMUs at or below unity. Although cross efficiency goes a further step by providing an efficiency measure in terms of the best multiplier bundle for the unit and all the other DMUs, it is not always unique. This paper presents a new and modified DEA game cross-efficiency model where each DMU is viewed as a competitor via non-cooperative game. For each competing DMU, a multiplier bundle is determined that optimizes the efficiency score for that DMU , with the additional constraint that the resulting score should be at or above that DMU 's estimated best performance. The problem, of course, arises that we will not know this best performance score for the DMU under evaluation until the best performances of all other DMUs are known. To combat this \u201cchicken and egg\u201d phenomenon, an iterative approach leading to the Nash equilibrium is presented. The current paper provides a modified variable returns to scale (VRS) model that yields non-negative cross-efficiency scores. The approach is applied to the last six Summer Olympic Games. Our results may indicate that our game cross-efficiency model implicitly incorporates the relative importance of gold, silver and bronze medals without the need for specifying the exact assurance regions.",

        "abstract": "As an extension to data envelopment analysis (DEA), cross-efficiency evaluation method not only provides a ranking among the decision making units (DMUs), but also eliminates unrealistic DEA weighting schemes without requiring a prior information on weight restrictions. A factor that possibly reduces the usefulness of the cross-efficiency evaluation method is that the cross-efficiency scores may not be unique due to the presence of alternate optima. As a result, it is recommended that secondary goals be introduced in cross-efficiency evaluation. In some cases, pursuing the best ranking is more important than maximizing the individual score. This paper seeks to propose a novel model for optimizing the ranking order for each DMU to determine the final cross-efficiency of all DMUs. Finally, preference voting application is presented to illustrate the differences between the proposed and existed models.",

Both the decision-maker's attitude towards risk and the penalty parameters for demand deviation are considered in the objective function. A service level agreement, upper bound for each selected supplier's allocation and the number of selected suppliers are considered as constraints. A novel robust optimisation approach is employed to solve this problem under different economic situations. Illustrative examples are presented with managerial implications highlighted to support decision-making.",

Previous literature of cooperative advertising mainly focus on \"single-manufacturer and single -retailer\", whereas few of them focus on \"single-manufacturer and multi-retailers\". Due to the increasing market power of retailers, the competition between manufacturers becomes more and more intense, and the decision-making framework of multi-manufacturers and single-retailer is becoming more realistic. In view of these, three typical situations based on the framework of \"two- manufacturers and single-retailer\" are discussed in this paper, i.e., (i) the two manufacturers and the retailer make decisions independently, (ii) the retailer is vertically integrated with one manufacturer, and (iii) the two manufacturers are integrated horizontally. Utilizing the differential game theory, the optimal advertising levels for each stage of the system are calculated and compared for the three different situations.",

Recently, as a nonparametric mathematical programming approach, Data envelopment analysis has been applied in DA area and received great attention. In this paper, we propose a new discriminant approach based upon the relative distance measured by super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA). This approach may generally avoid the drawbacks that usually occur in statistics discriminations of constructing function to determine a DMU's category. On the other hand, this approach may maintain discriminant capabilities by incorporating the non-parametric feature of DEA into DA. At the same time, it can also inherit the advantages of avoiding the process of dealing with different dimensional data in DEA. Our approach can be used to classify a sample's category by the discrimination results, even in the multiple-groups situation. Therefore, it can be applied to the discriminant analysis in various real-life cases.",

First, we change the undesirable outputs to be desirable ones by reversing, then we do principal component analysis (PCA) on the ratios of a single desirable output to a single input. In order to reduce the dimensionality of data set, the required principal components have been selected from the generated ones according to the given choice principle. Then a linear monotone increasing data transformation is made to the chosen principal components to avoid being negative. Finally, the transformed principal components are treated as outputs into data envelopment analysis (DEA) models with a natural assurance region (AR).

        "abstract": "This research focuses on an open-loop reverse supply chain, which includes a single centralized returns center (CRC) and multiple local collection points (LCPs). Each LCP receives a stream of returned products from consumers and once its inventory reaches its economic inventory level, these products are immediately delivered to the CRC. The CRC begins to handle those returned products when its inventory reaches its economic batch size. Special attention is placed on the joint inventory control and product return handling policies. The purpose of this study is to find the optimal economic delivery batch size for the LCPs as well as the optimal handling batch size for the CRC in order to minimize the long-run average cost for the open-loop reverse supply chain. An algorithm to find an optimal policy of delivery batch size for LCPs and handling batch size for CRC is developed. We present detailed discussions on how the optimal policy of delivery as well as the handling batch sizes changes with respect to changes in system parameters. We show that the formulas for optimal policies of delivery and handling batch sizes are modifications of the EOQ model. Simulation results illustrate that our model development is suitable for more general situations. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The technique to transform the proposed model into a linear programming is also given. Relative to traditional CCR model, the proposed model can work better to reflect the frontier production ability of multi-stage parallel-series production systems, and can rate the technique efficiencies of multi-stage parallelseries systems more reasonably.

We provide a decision-making framework on how to allocate the advertising budget to the two platforms for the best results. The integrated effect of advertising investment consists of two parts. Goodwill and customer scale reflect the long-term achievement, and sale profit represents the short-term achievement. We selected some representative feasible investment plans as decision-making units (DMUs), and calculated the values of sale profit, goodwill, and customer scale as three outputs. To determine the best advertising investment plan, we use data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to seek efficient plans, and then determine the best one from those efficient plans through preference investigation and super-efficiency technique.

        "abstract": "This paper discusses how a manufacturer and its retailers interact with each other in order to optimize their individual net profits by adjusting product marketing (advertising and pricing) and inventory policies in an information-asymmetric VMI (vendor managed inventory) supply chain. The manufacturer produces and supplies a single product at the same wholesale price to multiple retailers who then sell the product in dispersed and independent markets at retail prices. The demand rate in each market is an increasing and concave function of the advertising investments of both local retailers and the manufacturer, but a decreasing and convex function of the retail prices. The manufacturer determines its wholesale price, its advertising investment, replenishment cycles for the raw materials and finished product, and backorder quantity to maximize its profit. Retailers in turn consider the replenishment policies and the manufacturer's promotion policies and determine the optimal retail prices and advertisement investments to maximize their profits. This problem is modeled as a Stackelberg game where the manufacturer is the leader and retailers are followers. An algorithm has been proposed to search the Stackelberg equilibrium. A numerical study has been conducted to demonstrate how the algorithm works and to understand the influences of decision variables and/or parameters. Several research questions are examined, including under what circumstances the retailers and manufacturer should increase their advertising expenditures and/or reduce the retail prices and what actions should be taken if the prices of raw materials or their holding costs increase.",

        "abstract": "The increasing use of information technology (IT) has resulted in a need for evaluating the productivity impacts of IT. The contemporary IT evaluation approach has focused on return on investment and return on management. IT investment has impacts on different stages of business operations. For example, in the banking industry, IT plays a key role in effectively generating (i) funds from the customer in the forms of deposits and then (ii) profits by using deposits as investment funds. Existing approaches based upon data envelopment analysis (DEA) only measure the IT efficiency or impact on one specific stage when a multi-stage business process is present. A detailed model is needed to characterize the impact of IT on each stage of the business operation. The current paper develops a DEA non-linear programming model to evaluate the impact of IT on multiple stages along with information on how to distribute the IT-related resources so that the efficiency is maximized. It is shown that this non-linear program can be treated as a parametric linear program. It is also shown that if there is only one intermediate measure, then the non-linear DEA model becomes a linear program. Our approach is illustrated with an example taken from previous studies.",

It deals with organization can be modeled as consisting of several production units, each of which has parallel production lines. The previous studies in the DEA literature only deal with reallocating/allocating organizational resources to production units and set targets for them. In their researches, the production unit is treated as a black box. In such circumstances, how to arrange the production at production unit level is not clear. This paper serves to generate resource allocation and target setting plan for each production unit by opening the black box. The proposed model exploits production information of production lines in generating production plans. The resulting plan has following characteristics: (1) the performance of each production lines are evaluated under common weights; (2) the weights chose for evaluation keep the efficiency of the entire unit not worse off; (3) the worst behaved production line in the production unit under evaluation are improved as much as possible. Finally, the real data of a production system extracted from extant literature are used to demonstrate the proposed method.",

It first investigates the effect of the fixed cost on each DMU and on the collection of DMUs. Next we prove that there exist some cost allocations which can make each DMU and the collection of DMUs efficient. We show that such a cost allocation is unique and equivalent to the proportional sharing method if the fixed cost allocation problem is a one-dimensional case. In a multidimensional case, the fixed cost allocations may not be unique. This paper defines the concept of satisfaction degree, and proposes a maxmin model and a corresponding algorithm to generate a unique fixed cost allocation.

        "abstract": "Aiming at the insu_ciency that the traditional sales-rebate contract cannot coordinate the supply chain, this paper studies how sales-rebate contract inuences the coordination of supply chain induced by fairness preferences. Assuming the retailer is fairness preferred in the market with random demand, the paper analyzes two situations, namely, retailer order less than the sales-rebate threshold and not less than the sales-rebate threshold by the fairness preferred model. We find that taking into consideration fairness preferences in sales-rebate contract broadens the voluntary cooperation prospects between suppliers and retailers, can increase the profit of the overall supply chain, and has the balanced result of fully cooperation, which better coordinates the supply chain. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the model.",

        "abstract": "Due to the escalating deterioration of environment (e.g. diminishing raw material resources, overflowing waste sites and increasing levels of pollution), sustainable development and environment protection have becoming two major issues of modern society. At the rhythm of being environmental friendly, Green Supply Chain Management (GrSCM), with a main idea of reducing costs while helping the environment, has received increasing attention from both the academic researchers and practitioners during the past decade. The Green Supply Chain Management (GrSCM), which is also called the Green Sustainable Supply Chain by some researchers, is defined as 'integrating environmental thinking into supply chain management, including product design, material sourcing and selection, manufacturing processes, delivery of the final product to the consumers as well as end-of-life management of the product after its useful life' (Srivastava 2007; Zhu and Sarkis 2004). As illustrated in Srivastava (2007), the study of GrSCM is generally concentrated on two areas, i.e., green design and green operations. In detail, literatures on green design emphasize on environmental conscious design (ECD) and life-cycle assessment/ analysis (LCA) of the product, and concentrates on developing an understanding of how design decisions affect a product's environmental compatibility (Glantschnig 1994; Navin-Chandra 1991; Madu et al. 2002). Similarly, green operations involve all operational aspects related to reverse logistics (RL) and network design, green manufacturing and remanufacturing and waste management. Some key issues on green operations include: integrating remanufacturing with internal operations (Ferrer and Whybark 2001), understanding the effects of competition among remanufacturers (Majumder and Groenevelt 2001), integrating product design, product take-back and supply chain incentives (Guide and van Wassenhove 2001, 2002), integrating remanufacturing and RL with supply chain design (Chouinard et al. 2005; Fleischmann et al. 2001; Goggin and Browne 2000; Savaskan et al. 2004). In fact, reverse supply chain (or reverse logistics) plays a significant role in the practice of green operation and most of the issues of green operations mentioned above are original from the study of reverse supply chain. According to Guide and Van Wassenhove (2002), reverse supply chain is a series of activities required to retrieve a used product from a customer and either dispose it or reuse it. Those activities include collection, testing, sorting, transportation and processing.",

        "abstract": "Existing approaches for DEA cross-efficiency evaluation are mainly focused on the calculation of cross-efficiency matrix but pay little attention to the aggregation of the efficiencies in the cross-efficiency matrix. The most widely used approach is to aggregate the efficiencies in each row or column in the cross-efficiency matrix with equal weights into an average cross-efficiency score for each Decision Making Unit (DMU) and view it as the overall performance measurement of the DMU. This paper focuses on the aggregation process of the efficiencies in the cross-efficiency matrix and proposes the use of Shannon entropy for cross-efficiency aggregation. In the study, we propose an entropy model to generate a set of weights for aggregating and determining the ultimate cross-efficiency instead of the traditional average cross-efficiency. We prove that the set of weight is a unique global optimal solution which can reflect the goodness of this method. Finally, two examples of a flexible manufacturing system and 27 industrial robots are illustrated to examine the validity of the proposed method. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "The Malmquist productivity index studies productivity change, that is, the technical progress or regress together with the efficiency changes over time. In a nonparametric framework, the index can be estimated by data envelopment analysis (DEA). In this paper, first all inputs are divided into three groups, namely, discretionary variables, nondiscretionary variables, and semi-discretionary variables, and then a mixed integer linear model is proposed to deal with semi-discretionary variables. The proposed models consider not only the properties of semi-discretionary inputs, but also the relationship between them and other inputs. By introducing such a relationship and the preferences of decision-makers (DMs), the models aid DMs in generating efficiency scores and finding proper benchmarking points. Finally, the Malmquist productivity index combining the proposed model is computed and illustrated by an empirical application to the evaluation of 17 branches of Bank of China in Anhui Province. The results show a slight decrease in productivity during the year 2007/2008, and the productivity change positively during 2008/2009 due largely to efficiency increase. \u00a9 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

We find that if product substitution is ignored returns policy may greatly harm the manufacturer in situations which we call returns policy trap. In such situations, when buy-back price exceeds certain threshold called trap price, the retailer's best order quantity of the considered product drops sharply to zero, which means that the manufacturer may lose all orders. We also find that in returns policy trap all orders shift to substitute's manufacturer. When the product is easier to be substituted for or target service level is lower, the trap price is lower and the manufacturer faces more danger when using returns policy.",

        "abstract": "Data envelopment analysis (DEA), a useful assessment tool, has been used to solve the problem of preference voting and aggregation which require the determination of the weights associated with different ranking places. Instead of applying the same externally imposed weighting scheme to all candidates, DEA models allow each candidate to choose his/her own weights in order to maximize his/her own overall ratings subject to certain conditions. It is evident that competition exists among the candidates in a preferential election, while there is no literature considering the factor of competition. This paper proposes an approach to rank candidates based on DEA game cross efficiency model, in which each candidate is viewed as a player who seeks to maximize its own efficiency, under the condition that the cross efficiencies of each of other DMU's does not deteriorate. The game cross efficiency score is obtained when the DMU's own maximized efficiencies are averaged. The obtained game cross efficiency scores constitute a Nash Equilibrium point. Therefore, the results and orders based upon game cross efficiency analysis are more reliable and will benefit the decision-maker.",

First, we have defined an efficiency change ratio (ECR) to calculate the marginal impact of each variable on the efficiency evaluation, which compares the efficiency scores of the two radial DEA models differing in whether the given variable is included. Based upon a simple data example, this paper finds that it is not suitable to use ECR to determine the importance of each variable, for the value of the variable's ECR is very sensitive to the selected input set and output set. Then, this paper has defined a characteristic function of each coalition (input or output variable set) based upon ECR. The characteristic function is super-additive. Thus, we use Shapley value index as the solution of the cooperative game to determine the importance of the variable under evaluation. Finally, the proposed approach has been applied to a data set from prior DEA literature.",

Rank- ing approach has been actively sought by the researchers to improve the potential capabilities and to fully rank efficient, as well as ineffi- cient, decision making units. Distinguishing from the other researches, this article proposes integrated DEA ranking methods considering the preference of decision makers and management practice. Since the performance and process of some DMUs are widely recognized and viewed as the best practice by the decision makers, we include the preferable DMUs in a special reference set called benchmarking set (BS). Our problem is to find common weights, putting the best practice and preferable information of decision makers into consideration, as well as concerning about the efficiencies of other DMUs, which is more convincible and feasible and can easily be accepted by all DMUs than that derived from traditional DEA models. We expect the common weights resulted from the proposed integrated DEA models could guarantee those DMUs in BS DEA efficient. A numerical example concerning the Chinese universities is provided to illustrate the feasibility and convincement of the models.",

        "abstract": "An appropriate performance measurement system is an important requirement for the effective management of a supply chain.\n Two hurdles are present in measuring the performance of a supply chain and its members. One is the existence of multiple measures\n that characterize the performance of chain members, and for which data must be acquired; the other is the existence of conflicts\n between the members of the chain with respect to specific measures. Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) cannot be\n employed directly to measure the performance of supply chain and its members, because of the existence of the intermediate\n measures connecting the supply chain members. In this paper it is shown that a supply chain can be deemed as efficient while\n its members may be inefficient in DEA-terms. The current study develops several DEA-based approaches for characterizing and\n measuring supply chain efficiency when intermediate measures are incorporated into the performance evaluation. The models\n are illustrated in a seller-buyer supply chain context, when the relationship between the seller and buyer is treated first\n as one of leader-follower, and second as one that is cooperative. In the leader-follower structure, the leader is first evaluated,\n and then the follower is evaluated using information related to the leader's efficiency. In the cooperative structure, the\n joint efficiency which is modelled as the average of the seller's and buyer's efficiency scores is maximized, and both supply\n chain members are evaluated simultaneously. Non-linear programming problems are developed to solve these new supply chain\n efficiency models. It is shown that these DEA-based non-linear programs can be treated as parametric linear programming problems,\n and best solutions can be obtained via a heuristic technique. The approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative advertising, which usually occurs in a vertical supply chain, is typically a cost sharing and promotion mechanism for the manufacturer to affect retail performance. Research in the literature, however, rarely considers the important phenomenon that advertising has a positive effect on the consumer's reference price. In fact, when a consumer makes a decision to buy a product or not, a reference price is usually in his mind and plays a determinant role. Taking into account the impact of advertising on the reference price, this paper proposes a dynamic cooperative advertising model for a manufacturer-retailer supply chain and analyzes how the reference price effect would influence the decisions of all the channel members. In our model, both the consumer's goodwill and reference price for the product are assumed to be influenced by the advertising and are modeled in differential dynamic equations. In addition, the advertising level, the consumer's goodwill and the reference price are all assumed to have positive effect on sales. Utilizing differential game theory, this paper formulates the optimal decisions of the manufacturer and the retailer in two different game scenarios: Stackelberg game and cooperative game. Also, this paper proposes a new mechanism to coordinate the supply chain in which both the manufacturer and the retailer share each other's advertising costs. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In order to achieve a higher degree of coordination and automation among the supply chain parties, the supply chain sometimes invests in reducing the ordering cost to streamline and speed up transactions via the application of information technology. In this paper, an integrated vendor-managed inventory (VMI) model is presented for a single vendor and multiple buyers, where the vendor purchases, and processes raw materials and then delivers finished items to multiple buyers. A joint relevant cost model is developed with constant production and demand rates under the assumption that the buyers' ordering cycles may be different and that each buyer can replenish more than once in one production cycle, in which the investment decision is also considered. A solution procedure of the optimal investment amount and replenishment decision for all the buyers and the vendor is proposed. Three numerical examples with an exponential ordering cost function are presented to provide insight. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In the process, one may encounter many problems, such as the selection tools, correlation analysis, and the classification of input versus output status. In this paper, we propose a new method for choosing DEA variables. Unlike previous research, it is based on the conception of cash value added (CVA), and can make a selection according to the statistic results. This new method has some advantages: first, it is more objective, avoiding the influence of subjective factors on the subsequent calculation; second and most important is that it provides managers and researchers with measurement variables and exact classifications of these factors; third, all variables under discussion come from financial statements which are easily available. This variable selection method has been applied to 14 Chinese commercial banks, and both regression and statistic test results are satisfactory.",

        "abstract": "To eliminate the possible multiple solutions in the cross efficiency method, researchers proposed two approaches including the aggressive strategy and the benevolent strategy in which all of the other decision-making units are simultaneously treated as adversaries (allies) to the unit under evaluation. However, none of the strategy may accord completely with the individual preference of a specific DMU. Therefore this paper proposed a DEA cross-efficiency method considering both competition and cooperation among DMUs. All decision making units are divided into several groups. For a given DMU, its optimal preferential weights can maximize the aggregated efficiency of its allies and also minimize the aggregated efficiency of its adversaries. The proposed strategy allows for a specific DMU's individual preference in differential treatment to other DMUs, which makes it more applicable. Finally a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed approach.",

The proposed model can uncover much more useful information through better exploration of observational data and manager's experience.It estimates the production potential and provides the accompanying probability, which serves as theoretical support for decision makers to allocate resource and set targets.Finally, simulated data are used to demonstrate the proposed model and the results are compared with those from BCC model.It is shown that the proposed model can discover production information to support for higher targets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In many real managerial applications, an issue of considerable importance is allocating a total fixed cost across a set of competing decision making units (DMUs). The fixed cost allocation problem has also become one of the most important applications of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology. In this paper, we will approach the fixed cost allocation problem by explicitly considering both competition and cooperation relationships among DMUs. To this end, we integrate cooperative game theory and the cross efficiency method to develop a DEA-game cross efficiency approach to generate a unique and fair allocation plan. With the proposed approach, each DMU is considered as a player and a super-additive characteristic function is defined for coalitions of DMUs. Then, the Shapley value is calculated for each DMU and accordingly associated common weights are optimized to determine the final allocation plan. Since the cross efficiency method considers peer appraisal and the cooperative game theory allows for equitable negotiations, all DMUs are supposed to reach a consensus on the equitable allocation scheme through our novel approach. From this perspective, our proposed approach is promising and attractive for allocating a fixed cost in large organizations. Finally, the DEA-game cross efficiency approach is demonstrated with a numerical example derived from previous literature and the results are compared to some existing methods. Additionally, we apply the proposed approach to an empirical application concerning city commercial bank activities in China.",

        "title": "A new data envelopment analysis based approach for fixed cost allocation.",
        "abstract": "In many real applications, there exist situations where some independent and decentralized entities will construct a common platform for production processes. A natural and essential problem for the common platform is to allocate the fixed cost or common revenue across these entities in an equitable way. Since there is no powerful central decision maker, each decision-making unit (DMU) might propose an allocation scheme that will favor itself, giving itself a minimal cost and/or a maximal revenue. It is clear that such allocations are egoistic and unacceptable to all DMUs except for the distributing DMU. In this paper, we will address the fixed cost allocation problem in this decentralized environment. For this purpose, we suggest a non-egoistic principle which states that each DMU should propose its allocation proposal in such a way that the maximal cost would be allocated to itself. Further, a preferred allocation scheme should assign each DMU at most its non-egoistic allocation and lead to efficiency scores at least as high as the efficiency scores based on non-egoistic allocations. To this end, we integrate a goal programming method with data envelopment analysis methodology to propose a new model under a set of common weights. The final allocation scheme is determined in such a way that the efficiency scores are maximized for all DMUs through minimizing the total deviation to goal efficiencies. Finally, both a numerical example from prior literature and an empirical study of nine truck fleets are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "High energy consumption by the industry of developing countries has led to the problems of increasing emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) (primarily CO2) and worsening energy shortages. To address these problems, many mitigation measures have been utilized. One major measure is to mandate fixed reductions of GHG emission and energy consumption. Therefore, it is important for each developing country to disaggregate their national reduction targets into targets for various geographical parts of the country. In this paper, we propose a DEA-based approach to allocate China\u2019s national CO2 emissions and energy intensity reduction targets over Chinese provincial industrial sectors. We firstly evaluate the energy and environmental efficiency of Chinese industry considering energy consumption and GHG emissions. Then, considering the necessity of mitigating GHG emission and energy consumption, we develop a context-dependent DEA technique which can better characterize the changeable production with reductions of CO2 emission and energy intensity, to help allocate the national reduction targets over provincial industrial sectors. Our empirical study of 30 Chinese regions for the period 2005\u20132010 shows that the industry of China had poor energy and environmental efficiency. Considering three major geographical areas, eastern China\u2019s industrial sector had the highest efficiency scores while in this aspect central and western China were similar to each other at a lower level. Our study shows that the most effective allocation of the national reduction target requires most of the 30 regional industrial to reduce CO2 emission and energy intensity, while a few can increase or maintain their 2010 levels.",

        "abstract": "Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been extended to cross-efficiency evaluation to provide better discrimination and ranking of decision-making units (DMUs). However, the non-uniqueness of optimal weights in the traditional DEA models (CCR and BCC models) has reduced the usefulness of the DEA cross-efficiency evaluation method. To solve this problem, we introduce the concept of the satisfaction degree of a DMU towards a set of optimal weights for another DMU. Then, a new DEA cross-efficiency evaluation approach, which contains a maxmin model and two algorithms, is proposed based on the satisfaction degrees of the DMUs. Our maxmin model and algorithm 1 can obtain for each DMU an optimal set of weights that maximises the least satisfaction degrees among all the other DMUs. Further, our algorithm 2 can then be used to guarantee the uniqueness of the optimal weights for each DMU. Finally, our approach is applied to a real-world case study of technology selection.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTMany studies have dealt with the problem of fixed cost allocation by using data envelopment analysis. However, existing models allocate the fixed cost by treating the decision-making units (DMUs) as black-boxes and ignore the internal production structures of DMUs. To our knowledge, only a few work has considered the fixed cost allocation problem for an elementary two-stage production structure without external inputs and outputs. This paper deals with the fixed cost allocation problem for a general two-stage network production structure, in which both external inputs and outputs exist. Specifically, additive two-stage models are first presented to evaluate the performance for each DMU when allocating the fixed cost. Then, by introducing the concepts of satisfaction degree and fairness degree, we propose an approach to obtain an optimal allocation plan under the control of the centralized authority. Finally, an application to 27 banks is utilized to illustrate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In a multi-product, flexible manufacturing environment, line capacity of printed wiring board (PWB) assembly systems may need to be adjusted at the beginning of each aggregate planning period because of demand fluctuation over multiple periods. A model of equipment changeover scheduling (ECSP) at the aggregate level was developed in [1]. In the described solution procedure, a recursive programming is applied to confine the decision searching space. This paper addresses the impacts of the recursive planning on solutions to ECSP. By analyzing and computing experiments, it is observed that impacts of the recursive planning are twofold: firstly it provides a feasible way to deal with the nonlinearity of average production cost; furthermore, it can improve capacity utilization of the redesign.",

Under the assumption that each machine line is dedicated to produce one product family, the model can be decomposed as a relatively small subproblem, and each subproblem has good properties by which the subproblems can be further simplified and decomposed over multiple planning periods. As the result, the original large-scale two-stage mixed integer programming problem can be approximately solved by solving a series of small scale mixed integer programming which can be implemented on work station or a PC. Computational studies show the efficiency and benefits of the developed solution approach.",

We propose SMAA-AD model and illustrate how SMAA-AD model is used in such stochastic MCDM problems. In SMAA-AD model, absolute dominant method is used to turn stochastic criterion values into deterministic absolute dominant values, and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) is used to rank the alternatives without foreknowing the decision maker\u2019 preference on criterion weights. SMAA-AD model provides three indices, i.e., rank acceptability index, holistic acceptability index and central weight vector, to support the decision in the stochastic MCDM problems. SMAA-AD model overcomes some shortcomings of traditional MCDM methods. For example, it needs not to predefine any parameters and functions. We use a case of technology competition for cleaning polluted soil in Helsinki to illustrate our method.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines a single-period supply chain system consisting of a manufacturer selling an option contract to a capital-constrained retailer who faces stochastic demand. Option contract can transfer partial risk from the retailer to the manufacturer. This paper extends the existing literature of game-theoretic and credit financing models by explicitly incorporating retaileru0027s default risk into the pure option ordering and pricing decision problems. Stackelberg equilibriums under different scenarios, i.e., capital sufficient, capital constraint without credit, bank credit (BC), and trade credit (TC), are derived. The analytic model demonstrates that, under TC, the retailer can behave with and without bankruptcy risk, which depends on the retaileru0027s initial capital. Both the mathematical model and computational experiments reveal that the decisions and profits under BC are independent of retaileru0027s default risk, whereas default risk has a significant impact on the decisions and profits under TC. It shows that TC contract can partially coordinate the supply chain.",

Considering that both innovation and advertising contribute to the product demand, we first investigate the optimal equilibriums of channel members under two different game structures: the non-cooperative and cooperative. In the non-cooperative structure, the manufacturer controls the innovation effort and wholesale price while the retailer controls the advertising rate and retail pricing. In the cooperative structure, the manufacturer agrees to share part of retailer\u2019s advertising expenditure. We find that both the optimal operation and marketing decisions are sensitive to effects of innovation and advertising on demand as well as the manufacturer\u2019s cost reduction coefficient due to innovation. Further, we find that the manufacturer always prefers cooperation. Meanwhile, only when the firms\u2019 investments significantly contribute to the market mechanism, does the retailer have incentive to implement a cooperative program. In addition, we further propose a new two-way subsidy policy to coordinate channel members\u2019 business functions.",

Each pair of debt relations is modeled with both forward debt chain and backward debt chain to simplify the whole debt network with a developed algorithm. A debt clearing strategy is derived and its benefits and managerial implications are shown in risk management. This paper further demonstrates the validation of the approach for sovereign debt analysis and risk analytics using real debt data from ten developed countries.",

Thus, establishing a society with resource conservation and environmental harmony, typically reusing the pollution and waste from the industrial production, has attracted attention from both the government and the public in recent years. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely used in measuring two-stage network structures that constituted with homogenous decision making units. However, previous works failed to take the undesirable intermediate products into account in the two-stage network structures including production system and disposal system. In this study, we build an additive DEA approach to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed new two-stage network structures, and propose a better efficiency decomposition to the individual system. Finally, our approach is applied to analyze the industrial production in 30 provincial level regions in mainland China and some implications are given.",

        "abstract": "Regarded as an effective method for treating the global warming problem, carbon emissions abatement (CEA) allocation has become a hot research topic and has drawn great attention recently. However, the traditional CEA allocation methods generally set efficient targets for the decision-making units (DMUs) using the farthest targets, which neglects the DMUs\u2019 unwillingness to maximize (minimize) some of their inputs (outputs). In addition, the total CEA level is usually subjectively determined without any consideration of the current carbon emission situations of the DMUs. To surmount these deficiencies, we incorporate data envelopment analysis and its closest target technique into the CEA allocation problem. Firstly, a two-stage approach is proposed for setting the optimal total CEA level for the DMUs. Then, another two-stage approach is given for allocating the identified optimal total CEA among the DMUs. Our approach provides more flexibility when setting new input and output targets for the DMUs in CEA allocation. Finally, the proposed approaches are applied for CEA target setting and allocation for 20 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies.",

        "abstract": "In a principal-agent relationship, although the principal (e.g., the investor) can control the inputs and decide the motivated payments to the agent (e.g., the top management team), she cannot have the ability to decide how many outputs she can be rewarded. Since the motivated payments the agent gains from the principal are closely related to the uncertain outputs, they also have the characteristic of uncertainty. Furthermore, the attitudes and behaviors of both parties, such as risk attitude of the principal/agent on the uncertainty of outputs/motivated payments, can have significant influence on the efficiencies of two parties and consequently affect the enthusiasm and effort of the agent. To address this issue, chance constrained data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is proposed. Based on this stochastic approach, the measures of the principal\u2019s efficiency, the agent\u2019s efficiency, and the agent\u2019s effort level are provided. A case study of 16 China listed real estate companies validates our models and shows that the uncertainties of outputs and payments have significant influences on the efficiencies of the principal and the agent and the effort of the agent as well.",

In this study, we develop a data envelopment analysis-based framework for energy saving and carbon emissions reduction in China. We first separate the related (hbox {CO}_{2}) emissions into various classifications and propose a framework for customized adjustment of energy saving strategy. Customized targets for the inefficient decision-making unites (DMUs) are introduced to improve the efficiencies based on energy conservation technology and energy structural adjustment. Step-by-step mechanisms of energy saving and carbon emissions reduction are provided for inefficient DMUs. To overcome the difficulties of energy consumption in China, the proposed approach provides a flexible way by making proper energy saving and carbon emissions reduction strategies. Detailed analysis of the regional energy saving and carbon emissions reduction targets in China is illustrated to better verify the proposed approach.",

Such a system is composed of an economic and environmental subsystem and a social subsystem. We first explore the performances of the subsystems and the system under an independently parallel setting and then establish an operational linkage to study the noncooperative and cooperative interactions between the subsystems in a linked parallel setting. A case study of 30 major Chinese cities is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the approach and the results show great discrimination of system performances among the cities. The major cities have distinct geographic characteristics which affect their economic and environmental efficiency as well as the social efficiency. It was found that in some of these sustainable development systems, the subsystems behave inharmoniously, which results in significant inefficiency.",

On account of unobservable and immeasurable characteristics of the TMT\u2019s effort, prior researches are of limited use in identifying its impact on the performances of the principal and TMT. This paper formulates novel models to overcome the limitations by incorporating DEA and bi-level programming into the principal\u2013agent framework. We begin with the basic models from the perspective of the principal and the TMT respectively, and propose integrated and bi-level models to illustrate the cooperative and leader\u2013follower collaboration between the two parties. We then develop an effort-based DEA model in which the effort of the TMT is viewed as a variable. By comparing optimal value of the variable with zero, we can identify whether the effort level is desired by the principal. A higher value larger (lower) than zero implies that the members of TMT exert higher (lower) effort. Further, we identify objectiv...",

        "abstract": "The application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as an alternative multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) tool has been gaining more attentions in the literatures. Doyle (Organ. Behav. Hum. Decis. Process. 62(1):87-100, 1995) presents a method of multi-attribute choice based on an application of DEA. In the first part of his method, the straightforward DEA is considered as an idealized process of self-evaluation in which each alternative weighs the attributes in order to maximize its own score (or desirability) relative to the other alternatives. Then, in the second step, each alternative applies its own DEA-derived best weights to each of the other alternatives (i. e., cross-evaluation), then the average of the cross-evaluations that get placed on an alternative is taken as an index of its overall score. In some cases of multiple criteria decision making, direct or indirect competitions exist among the alternatives, while the factor of competition is usually ignored in most of MCDM settings. This paper proposes an approach to evaluate and rank alternatives in MCDM via an extension of DEA method, namely DEA game cross-efficiency model in Liang, Wu, Cook and Zhu (Oper. Res. 56(5):1278-1288, 2008b), in which each alternative is viewed as a player who seeks to maximize its own score (or desirability), under the condition that the cross-evaluation scores of each of other alternatives does not deteriorate. The game cross-evaluation score is obtained when the alternative's own maximized scores are averaged. The obtained game cross-evaluation scores are unique and constitute a Nash equilibrium point. Therefore, the results and rankings based upon game cross-evaluation score analysis are more reliable and will benefit the decision makers. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the operational efficiency of three categories, and a total of 36 listed logistics firms in China. DEA-CCR, BCC, NIRS and SUP models, including two groups of financial and non-financial input and output measures, are used to discover the level and sources of efficiency and inefficiency of sample firms. The empirical results show that there are only one third of them with DEA efficiency value of 1, indicating that the overall efficiency of Chinese logistic industry is relatively low. And among three categories of service offerings, efficiency value of transporting firms is less than the average of logistic industry, with the lowest value for port firms, which can be attributed to scale inefficiency, mainly stemming from decreasing returns to scale (DRTS). Finally, the feasibility of DEA method of evaluating efficiency of logistic firms is demonstrated, and the related suggestions for efficiency improvement of Chinese logistic industry are also presented.

        "abstract": "The traditional data envelopment analysis model allows the decision-making units (DMUs) to evaluate their maximum efficiency values using their most favourable weights. This kind of evaluation with total weight flexibility may prevent the DMUs from being fully ranked and make the evaluation results unacceptable to the DMUs. To solve these problems, first, we introduce the concept of satisfaction degree of a DMU in relation to a common set of weights. Then a common-weight evaluation approach, which contains a max\u2013min model and two algorithms, is proposed based on the satisfaction degrees of the DMUs. The max\u2013min model accompanied by our Algorithm 1 can generate for the DMUs a set of common weights that maximizes the least satisfaction degrees among the DMUs. Furthermore, our Algorithm 2 can ensure that the generated common set of weights is unique and that the final satisfaction degrees of the DMUs constitute a Pareto-optimal solution. All of these factors make the evaluation results more satisfied and acceptable by all the DMUs. Finally, results from the proposed approach are contrasted with those of some previous methods for two published examples: efficiency evaluation of 17 forest districts in Taiwan and R&D project selection.",

The allocation of specific emission reduction tasks has become a significant issue and has drawn the attention of academia. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been extended to construct the allocation of emission reduction tasks model. These previous DEA-based approaches have strong assumptions about individual enterprise production.

With emission permits decreased, the enterprise can have new production strategy based on its own technology. Assuming emission permits can be freely bought and sold, we show how each enterprise can determine the optimal amount of emission allowance that should be used for production, which may leave some allowance to be sold for extra profit or may require the pur...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Environmental problems brought by industry are attracting extensive attention so a comprehensive analysis of industrial environmental performance is increasingly important. However, the comparison of industrial sector efficiencies is complicated by the fact that the natural resources consumed and/or the pollutants discharged by each sector may differ. In this paper, we extend the DEA model to consider two-sided non-homogeneous problems, handling DMU sets that have non-homogeneity in both inputs and outputs. This is different from the previous researches which generally focus on regional data to avoid non-homogeneity. Today environmental reform and energy conservation in various industrial sectors are both parts of the basic state policy of China. The empirical results show that: (1) Sectorsu0027 efficiencies are still low and unbalanced. The Recycling and Disposal of Waste department achieves the best energy saving and emission reduction efficiency. (2) 38 sectors can be clustered into four groups and set new benchmark in each group. (3) The overall efficiency of 38 industrial sectors in China maintained a rising trend in five years. With this more realistic analysis of environmental efficiency, the Chinese government can make more informed decisions to realize sustainable industrial development.",

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a non-parametric approach for efficiency evaluation of multi-input, multi-output systems has drawn a lot of attention. Recently, many two-stage DEA models were developed for studying the internal structures of two-stage systems. However, there was no work studying fair setting of the target intermediate products (or intermediate measures) although unreasonable setting will result in unfairness to the two stages because setting higher (fewer) intermediate measures means that the first (second) stage must make more efforts to achieve the overall production plan. In this paper, a new DEA model taking account of fairness in the setting of the intermediate products is proposed, where the fairness is interpreted based on Nash bargaining game model, in which the two stages negotiate their target efficiencies in the two-stage system based on their individual efficiencies. This approach is illustrated by an empirical application to insurance companies.",

To go inside the \u2018black box\u2019, in this paper, we propose a new DEA approach to allocate the resource in a bidirectional interactive parallel system. We consider not only the resource allocation of a certain DMU, but also the resource allocation of all DMUs for a centralized decision maker through centralized models.

        "abstract": "Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a methodology used to measure the relative efficiencies of peer decision-making units (DMUs). In the original model, it is assumed that in a multiple input, multiple output setting, all members of the input bundle affect the entire output bundle. There are many situations, however, where this assumption does not hold. In a manufacturing setting, for example, packaging resources (inputs) only influence the production of those products that require packaging. This is referred as partial input-to-output interactions where the DEA model is based on the view of a DMU as a business unit consisting of a set of independent subunits, such that efficiency of the DMU can be defined as a weighted average of the efficiencies of those subunits. The current paper presents an extension to that methodology to allow for efficiency measurement in situations where there exist multiple procedures or processes for generating given output bundles. The proposed model is then applied to the problem of evaluating the efficiencies of a set of steel fabrication plants.",

        "abstract": "The support vector machine (SVM) has been applied to the problem of bankruptcy prediction, and proved to be superior to competing methods such as the neural network, the linear multiple discriminant approaches and logistic regression. However, the conventional SVM employs the structural risk minimization principle, thus empirical risk of misclassification may be high, especially when a point to be classified is close to the hyperplane. This paper develops an integrated binary discriminant rule (IBDR) for corporate financial distress prediction. The described approach decreases the empirical risk of SVM outputs by interpreting and modifying the outputs of the SVM classifiers according to the result of logistic regression analysis. That is, depending on the vector's relative distance from the hyperplane, if result of logistic regression supports the output of the SVM classifier with a high probability, then IBDR will accept the output of the SVM classifier; otherwise, IBDR will modify the output of the SVM classifier. Our experimentation results demonstrate that IBDR outperforms the conventional SVM.",

The main characteristic of the ecological efficiency evaluation problem is that an undesirable output of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and a non-discretionary input (BOD emission quota) should be considered simultaneously. By analyzing the impacts of the non-discretionary input on decision-making units' (DMUs) desirable and undesirable outputs, a non-radial output-oriented DEA model is proposed. In the proposed model, we describe a new approach of defining reference set that requires reference units operate in a similar environment on average. We employ the model to provide efficient inputs/outputs targets for DMU managers to improve DMUs' efficiencies. Based on the developed model, impacts of the non-discretionary input on DMUs' returns are also analyzed. We illustrate the proposed model, using real data, for 32 paper mills along the Huai River in China. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology is a benchmarking tool where it is generally assumed that decision making units (DMUs) constitute a homogeneous set; specifically, it is assumed that all DMUs have a common (input, output) bundle. In earlier work by the authors the issue of non-homogeneity on the output side was investigated. There we examined a set of steel fabrication plants where not all plants produced the same set of products/outputs. In the current research we investigate non-homogeneity on the input side. Such can occur in manufacturing plants, for example, when the output bundle can be produced using different mixes of machines, robots and laborers. Thus, we can have an input configuration existing in a DMU that is different from the configuration in another DMU. As a practical application of this phenomenon, we examine the measurement of efficiencies of a set of provinces in China. There, all provinces have the same common set of outputs in the form of GDP, supported population, and an undesirable output, nitrogen dioxide. On the input side, however, this commonality is missing. While all provinces have water, capital investment and natural resources, the latter of these (natural resources) takes several different forms, namely coal, natural gas and petroleum. However, not all provinces have the same mix of these resources, nor are there clear exchange rates among these very different, albeit substitutable inputs. This means that that one cannot directly apply the conventional DEA methodology. This then raises the question as to how to fairly evaluate efficiency when the configuration or mix of inputs can differ from one DMU to another. To address this, we view the generation of outputs for a province as a set of processes created by the different configurations of natural resources available. We develop a DEA type of methodology to evaluate these processes. This evaluation provides important insights into not only the overall performance of each province, but as well provides measures of the efficiency of the various configurations of the three natural resources.",

        "abstract": "An important area of research involving the benchmarking methodology data envelopment analysis (DEA), concerns the modeling of multistage situations. In the usual multistage settings, it is generally assumed that all decision-making units (DMUs) have the same number and configuration of stages. However, in many real-world examples, this assumption does not hold. Consider, for example, a supply chain setting where for some DMUs, products are shipped directly from a supplier to a retailer (single-stage), while for other DMUs, products can be transshipped through distribution centers (two or more stages). In the current paper, we investigate an efficiency measurement situation where the DMUs exhibit a mix of single and two-stage setups. The particular case examined involves a set of high technology firms that can be thought of as falling into two groups; those firms where the output of interest is the annual revenue generated, and those that not only generate revenue, but as well invest a portion of that revenue in Ru0026D. Firms in the first group can be viewed as being single-stage DMUs while those in the other group are of the two-stage type. The modeling complication here is that the set of DMUs do not explicitly form a homogeneous set of units. We develop a DEA-style model aimed at measuring efficiency in the presence of such nonhomogeneous two-group structures.",

        "abstract": "In the usual data envelopment analysis (DEA) setting, as pioneered by Charnes et al. (1978) [1], it is assumed that a set of decision making units (DMUs) is to be evaluated in terms of their relative efficiencies in converting a bundle of inputs into a bundle of outputs. The usual assumption in DEA is that each output is impacted by each and every member of the input set. One particular area of recent research is that relating to partial input to output impacts where the main issue addressed is that in many settings not all inputs impact all outputs. In that situation the authors view the DMU as consisting of a set of mutually exclusive subunits, with each subunit having its own unique bundle of inputs and outputs. Examined as well in this area, is the presence of multiple processes for generating sets of outputs. Missing from that earlier work is consideration of the presence of outputs in the form of by-products, giving rise to a parent-offspring phenomenon. One of the modeling complications there is that the parent assumes two different roles; as an input affecting the offspring, while at the same time being the dominant output. This gives rise to a model that we refer to as conditional two-stage. Another complication is that in the presence of multiple processes, by-products often arise out of only a subset of those processes. In the current paper we develop a DEA-type of methodology to handle partial input to output impacts in the presence of by-products.",

This study proposes the application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for measuring the efficiencies of the ecological systems in various regions of that country. The proposed approach differs from most of the previous ecological systems models in that we view it in a two stage setting; the first stage models the ecological system itself, and from an economic perspective, while the second stage (decontamination system) models water recycling as a feedback process, and the treatment of other undesirable outputs coming from the first stage. There, we separate polluting gases and water into two parts; one part is treated, while the other is discharged. The model considers two major desirable outputs from the first stage, namely Population and Gross Region Product by expenditure (GRP), as well as undesirable variables in the form of consumed water, and certain pollutants, namely nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and soot. At the same time, these undesirable outputs from the first stage are inputs to the second decontamination stage. As well, recycled water is fed back into stage 1. Thus, intermediate variables such as consumed water and waste gas emission simultaneously play dual roles of both outputs and inputs in the ecological system.",

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been extended to cross-efficiency evaluation for ranking decision making units (DMUs) and eliminating unrealistic weighting schemes. Unfortunately, the non-unique optimal weights problem in DEA has reduced the usefulness of this extended method. Aiming at solving this problem, we first incorporate a target identification model to get reachable targets for all DMUs. Then, several secondary goal models are proposed for weights selection considering both desirable and undesirable cross-efficiency targets of all the DMUs. Compared with the traditional secondary goal models, the cross-efficiency targets are improved in that all targets are always reachable for the DMUs. In addition, the proposed models considered the DMUs' willingness to get close to their desirable cross-efficiency targets and to avoid their undesirable cross-efficiency targets simultaneously while the traditional secondary goal models considered only the ideal targets of the DMUs. Finally, the calculation results of our proposed models are compared with those of some other traditional methods for two published examples: an efficiency evaluation of six nursing homes and an R&D project selection.",

In this paper, we develop a new two-stage data envelopment analysis approach for measuring the slacks-based efficiency of Chinese commercial banks during years 2008\u20132012, where the banking operation process of each bank is divided into a deposit-generation stage (division) and a deposit-utilization stage (division). In the approach, the increase of desirable outputs and the decrease of undesirable outputs are simultaneously considered in order to identify the inefficiency of a bank. Three efficiency statuses are first defined for such a system to investigate its input-output performance and divisional performances, and a full efficiency status is then defined based on these statuses. The empirical results show that the improvement of the banks\u2019 performances during this period was mainly contributed by the improvement of deposit-utilization stage. Besides, the results also show that our approach can provide a benchmark for the intermediate measures of the two stages of an inefficient bank.",

        "abstract": "Abstract When the allocated fixed cost is treated as the complement of other costs, conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) researches have ignored the effect of the return to scale (RTS) in fixed cost allocation problems. This paper first demonstrates why the RTS should be considered in fixed cost allocation problems. Then treating the fixed cost as a complementary input, the authors investigate the relationship between the allocated cost and the variable return to scale (VRS) efficiency based on the super BCC DEA model. However, the infeasibility problem may exist in this situation. To deal with it, the authors propose an algorithm. The authors find that the super BCC efficiency is a monotone non-increasing function of the allocated cost. Based on the relationship, the authors finally propose a fixed cost allocation approach in terms of principles as: (i) The fixed cost proportion allocated to inelastic DMUs should be consistent with their consumed cost proportion, and (ii) the same efficiency satisfaction degree to the rest DMUs. The optimal allocation scheme is unique. A numerical example and a real example of allocating fixed costs among 13 subsidiaries are employed to illustrate the proposed approach.",

The equilibrium is derived to investigate the impact of the ingredient brand awareness and the production costs on the suppliers\u2019 pricing competition, the manufacturer\u2019s product mix and retail price(s), and profits. The result shows that the manufacturer may provide unique product or differentiated products, depending on the effectiveness of ingredient branding strategy.

        "abstract": "Since sampling entails incurring network costs for real-time packet sampling and packet examination hardware in the network-based intrusion detection system, we would like to develop a network packet sampling strategy to effectively detect network intrusions without exceeding the velocity of the packet examination.We consider this problem in a game theoretic framework and introduce sampling schemes that are optimal in this game theoretic setting by the Minimax theorem and the max-flow min-cut theorem.According to the limitation and scarcity of this single intrusion node method,we introduce a method of risk management and extend the solution to more complex cases to choose sampling strategy while facing more various environments.Finally,we provide an empirical study to exemplify our improved method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Because of China\u2019s rapid economic development, its transportation system has become one of China\u2019s high-energy-consumption and high-pollution-emission sectors. However, little research has been done which pays close attention to China\u2019s transportation system, especially in terms of energy and environmental efficiency evaluation. In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to measure the energy and environment performance of transportation systems in China with the goal of sustainable development. This paper treats transportation as a parallel system consisting of subsystems for passenger transportation and freight transportation, and extends a parallel DEA approach to evaluate the efficiency of each subsystem. An efficiency decomposition procedure is proposed to obtain the highest achievable subsystem efficiency. Our empirical study on 30 of mainland China\u2019s provincial-level regions shows that most of them have a low efficiency in their transportation system and the two parallel subsystems. There are large efficiency differences between the passenger and freight transportation subsystems. In addition, unbalanced development has occurred in the three large areas of China, with the east having the highest efficiency, followed by central China and then west. Therefore, more measures should be taken to balance and coordinate the development between the three large areas and between the two subsystems within them. Our analysis approach gives data for determining effective measures.",

This study examines a system with a two-stage structure, in which the outputs from the first stage are taken as the inputs for the second stage. Two-stage systems can exist in centralized, decentralized, or mixed organizational modes. In this paper, we propose two-stage DEA models considering a degree of centralization that makes it possible to measure internal resource waste in different system modes. Some managerial insights are tested and verified from the perspective of efficiency analysis. We find that: 1) when there is only one intermediate measure in a centralized two-stage system, internal resource waste can be eliminated completely, and 2) a higher degree of centralization in a two-stage system can lead to less internal resource waste and more expected outputs. Finally, we present a numerical example and two practical real-world examples that illustrate our approach and findings.",

From the perspective of operation research, the factors of this success have been addressed as quick response, pre-position and logistic expertise. However, the waste made by FEMA for stockpiling food and ice in anticipation of a busy hurricane season in 2006 and several other cases indicate otherwise. In this paper, we introduce the private enterprise into a relief supply chain and propose an outsourcing framework to uncover the reason of Wal-Mart\u2019s success and provide explanations to the counter-cases. Our study shows that the effective relief effort carried out by private enterprises in responding to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 attributes to the combination of proactive response method and logistic expertise. Our findings advocate adopting different strategies to deal with different types of relief supplies. Specifically, the proactive insourcing strategy is good enough for a relief supply chain involving only imperishable relief supplies. For perishable goods, the proactive outsourcing strategy can make a relief supply more efficient.",

        "abstract": "E-commerce is becoming an increasingly important marketing channel, because it offers ease, convenience, and customization of products and services to customers. However, small and medium-sized hotels in China seldom create and run their own Web sites due to the low volume of visits and high cost. In order to improve sales and marketing, hotels cooperate with third-party Web sites to establish an electronic channel. Thus, the hotel improves its revenue from an increased occupancy rate, and the Web site generates revenue from the difference between the wholesale room rate provided by the hotel and the discounted rate for customers. Through developing a Stackelberg game model for the cooperation, this article investigates the optimal pricing strategies of hotels and Web sites; analyzes the effects of some parameters, such as standard room rate, on hotel and Web site revenues; and designs a revenue sharing strategy to achieve full channel coordination. This article demonstrates the existence of the equilibrium condition of cooperation between a Web site and several hotels. Managerial implications are suggested for cooperation between a small or medium-sized hotel and a Web site. \u00a9 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "Studies in the supply chain literature have typically focused on profit or revenue maximization and assumed that agents within the supply chain are self-interested and only care about their own monetary payoffs. Research in these areas, however, rarely considers an important phenomenon called inequity aversion in which the object pursued by agents within the supply chain is not only their own profit maximization but also the equity of profit allocation. In fact, when agents within a supply chain collaborate with each other to serve a market, the scheme of profit allocation between them usually plays a determinate role in cooperation. Taking into account the impact of agents\u2019 behavior of inequity aversion on the coordination of the supply chain, this paper investigates the optimal contracts and the manufacturer\u2019s pricing strategies in a single-manufacturer and single-retailer supply chain. In this way, we obtain two interesting results: (1) the retailer\u2019s equity aversion largely affects the manufacturer\u2019s decision making, which is not always bad for the manufacturer; and (2) the retailer\u2019s inequity aversion as well as the consumer\u2019s price-sensitive coefficient plays a dominant role in the manufacturer\u2019s decision making.",

Considering the supply chains can be centralized or decentralized, we demonstrate that quality improvement can be realized when a new channel is introduced. Moreover, we employ two themes in terms of channel-adding Pareto zone to characterize the impacts of channel structures on supply-chain performance, including the whole systemu0027s profit (for the centralized system), each playeru0027s profit (for the decentralized system), and consumer surplus. When price and quality decisions are considered, we find the supply chain performance could be improved due to a new channel augmented. Moreover, we show the effects of the quality sensitivity parameters of different channels on price and product quality, as well as profits and consumer surplus.",

In this study, we develop a data envelopment analysis-based framework for energy saving and carbon emissions reduction in China. We first separate the related \\(\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\) emissions into various classifications and propose a framework for customized adjustment of energy saving strategy. Customized targets for the inefficient decision-making unites (DMUs) are introduced to improve the efficiencies based on energy conservation technology and energy structural adjustment. Step-by-step mechanisms of energy saving and carbon emissions reduction are provided for inefficient DMUs. To overcome the difficulties of energy consumption in China, the proposed approach provides a flexible way by making proper energy saving and carbon emissions reduction strategies. Detailed analysis of the regional energy saving and carbon emissions reduction targets in China is illustrated to better verify the proposed approach.",

In practice, the choice of proper cooperation modes is a common issue for decision makers of underdeveloped destinations. To provide some insights into this issue, the authors propose a tourism supply-chain model consisting of one tour operator and two tourism destinations, one underdeveloped and one more mature. Unlike previous studies, in this model the mature tourism destination instead of the tour operator takes central place. Under different cooperation modes, the authors first analyse the equilibrium solutions and profits of all members of the decentralized decisionmaking situation. Then the quantity discount contract is used to coordinate the tourism supply chain and achieve reasonable profit allocation. Based on one numerical example, a comparison of the different cooperation modes is presented and recommendations are provided for the development of underdeveloped tourism destinations.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, many new and interesting business models for Internetbased selling have emerged with the advent of electronic commerce, one of which is the Internet-based group-buying. Since group-buying can be quickly built and removed, and the consumers can pay a lower price for the product through it, the group-buying can be a new online promotion form. In this chapter we build up a two-period pricing model for a supply chain when a supply chain member utilizes group-buying program to promote its products. In detail, we consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer, where the supplier or retailer may launch a group-buying program to promote the products via a group-buying web site in the promotion period (i.e., the first period), as well as the supplier may sell its products through the retailer traditionally in both periods. Utilizing game theory, we derive the equilibrium decisions of the two supply chain members in three different scenarios, that is, (i) there is no group-buying program, (ii) the supplier launches a group-buying program, and (iii) the retailer launches a group-buying program. Analysis of the equilibrium decisions illustrates the following results: (i) both, the supplier and the retailer, will set low prices in the promotion period and high prices in the regular period; (ii) this trend will be enhanced when a group-buying program occurs, especially when such program is launched by the supplier; (iii) while the retailer can always benefit from a groupbuying program, the supplier's profit may be reduced under certain conditions; and (iv) in spite of the fact that the supplier's profit may be damaged by the group-buying program, when the two supply chain members decide to launch a group-buying program, the unique equilibrium is that the supplier will launch such a program.

        "abstract": "Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has gained much popularity in performance measurement of power industry. This paper presents a slack-based measure approach to investigating the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and the environmental regulation of China's thermal power generation. We first calculate the total-factor energy efficiency without considering environmental constraints. An environmental performance indicator is proposed through decomposing the total-factor energy efficiency. The proposed approach is then employed to examine whether environmental regulation affects the energy efficiency of China's thermal power generation. We find that the environmental efficiency plays a significant role in affecting energy performance of China's thermal generation sector. Decreasing the discharge of major pollutants can improve both energy performance and environmental efficiency. Besides, we also have three main findings: (1) The energy efficiency and environmental efficiency were relatively low. (2) The energy and environmental efficiency scores show great variations among provinces. (3) Both energy efficiency and environmental efficiency are of obvious geographical characteristics. According to our findings, we suggest some policy implications. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Effective supply chain management (SCM) depends on the reasonable performance evaluation to the entire supply chain. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely developed to measure the performance of supply chains. Although there are sufficient researches on performance evaluation to supply chains, all of these precursory surveys assume that the inputs and outputs involved in performance evaluation are crisp data. However, in most situations only fuzzy information on intermediate factor is available. The current chapter integrates fuzzy intermediate factors in supply chain efficiency evaluation and proposes a fuzzy supply chain data envelopment analysis (FSCDEA) model based on previous supply chain DEA models. A triangular fuzzy membership function is attached on the fuzzy intermediate factors. According to the operational rules on triangular fuzzy numbers, we turn the FSCDEA model into a linear programming. Finally we use the proposed FSCDEA model to assess the operational efficiency of a group of bank branches. Three theorems about the FSCDEA efficiency are proposed and validated. The advantages of the FSCDEA model are also discussed. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The selected data set may exist information redundancy. On that account, this study proposes an alternative approach to screen out proper input and output variables set for evaluation via Akaike\u2019s information criteria () rule. This method mainly focuses on assessing the importance of subset of original variables rather than testing the marginal role of variables one by one in many other methods. In terms of the proposed approach, the most optimized variable set contains the least redundant information, which provides decision support to the decision makers. Besides, we also define redundant/cross redundant variables with the form of theorems and give the proofs subsequently. In addition, the  approach is firstly extended to stochastic data set to select an appropriate set of stochastic variables as well. Finally, the proposed approach has been applied to some data sets from given data and prior DEA literatures.",

        "abstract": "Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has proven to be a useful technique for evaluating the relative performance of comparable and homogeneous decision-making units (DMUs). In recent years, DEA-based resource allocation and target setting approaches have gained more and more attention from both practitioners and academic researchers. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to simultaneously adopt the principles of common weights and efficiency invariance in allocating multiple resources and setting multiple targets among DMUs. To obtain the final plan, we minimize the deviation between the possible plan based on common weights and another feasible plan emphasizing efficiency invariance. If the minimum deviation equals zero, one optimal plan will be determined. In general situations, however, the proposed approach will present two plans that have a non-zero deviation. One is generated by using a common set of weights for all DMUs in such a way that the change of efficiencies are minimized, while the other is generated by strictly keeping efficiency scores unchanged yet having similar or even identical weights on input-output measures for each DMU to the utmost extent. The efficacy and usefulness of the proposed approach are demonstrated using a numerical example from previous literature and an empirical application to an urban bus company in China.",

Although it is regarded as an essential strategy for firms, its relationship with firm performance seems inconclusive in the literature. To fill this gap, our study uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to develop models that help diversified firms more accurately calculate productivity at both the firm and its business segment levels, and then reallocate resources among business segments in order to achieve better firm overall performance. We empirically test the models using a sample of U.S. public firms for a period of 2012\u20132016. The results show that in comparison with two conventional DEA models, our model provides more useful productivity expression for diversified firms, and that the model-suggested resource reallocation is linked to better firm performance.",

We present an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach for solving convex QKPs where variables may take any integer value and all coefficients are real numbers. We approximate the function value using (a) continuous quadratic programming relaxation (CQPR), and (b) the integral parts of the solutions to CQPR. We propose a new heuristic which adaptively fixes the variables according to the solution of CQPR. We report computational results for QKPs with up to 200 integer variables. Our numerical results illustrate that the new heuristic produces high-quality solutions to large-scale QKPs fast and robustly.",

        "abstract": "In group decision-making, because of limitations on individual knowledge and information bases, or because of the existing decision rule, an individual decision maker may not be capable of evaluating selected alternatives. Such circumstances can lead to inconsistencies across group decision matrices. These inconsistencies are difficult to remedy under existing approaches. Based on Rough Set Theory, we thus propose a new approach that integrates two types of learning techniques. It first applies a machine-learning procedure that extracts possible alternatives from other decision makers that are currently not included in a given decision maker's alternative set. It then applies a group knowledge-learning model to determine corresponding attribute values of those newly learned alternatives in meeting a group's consistency requirement. Efficacy of the approach is illustrated by its application to China's MBA recruiting interview. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Classical DEA models (such as CCR and BCC models) compute efficiencies of decision-making units (DMUs) based on a common efficient frontier but with no capability of differentiating efficient units. The super efficiency model was developed to rank efficient DMUs based a new efficient frontier comprised by all other DMUs. This may lead to a multi-platform problem that different efficient DMUs are evaluated based on different efficient frontiers and the resulted super efficiencies of efficient DMUs are not comparable. This paper addresses the multi-platform problem from the perspective of a cooperative game. Efficient DMUs are regarded as players and subsets of these efficient DMUs as coalitions. The effect of a coalition on a specific efficient DMU is defined as the DMUu0027s efficiency change proportion (ECP) based on the traditional DEA models when the coalition is removed from the reference set. Basing on the ECP, we define a characteristic function as the sum of all efficient DMUs\u2019 ECPs, and prove that this function is super-additive. Then, the Shapley value is introduced as a solution of this cooperative game and applied to rank efficient DMUs. The proposed approach is demonstrated by two numerical examples. Finally, we extend the proposed approach in this paper to the VRS assumption.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a novel two-stage cost efficiency model to estimate and decompose the potential gains from Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As). In this model, a hypothetical DMU is defined as a combination of two or more candidate DMUs. The hypothetical DMU would surpass the traditional Production Possibility Set (PPS). In order to solve the problem, a Merger Production Possibility Set (PPSM) is constructed. The model minimizes the total cost of the hypothetical DMU while maintaining its outputs at the current level, and estimates the overall merger efficiency by comparing its minimal total cost with its actual cost. Moreover, the overall merger efficiency could be decomposed into technical efficiency, harmony efficiency, and scale efficiency. We show that the model can be extended to a two-stage structure and these efficiencies can be decomposed to both sub-systems. To show the usefulness of the proposed approach, we applied it to a real dataset of top 20 most competitive Chinese City Commercial Banks (CCBs). We concluded that (1) there exist considerably potential gains for the proposed merged banks. (2) It is also shown that the main impact on potential merger gains are from technical and harmony efficiency. (3) As an interesting result we found that the scale effect works against the merger, indicating that it is not favorable for a full-scale merger.",

In addition, the proposed approach is of vital significance in two special cases where the aggregated projected inputs are not proportional to the pre-merger aggregated inputs and where the production sizes are very different for the original decision-making units.

        "abstract": "Traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models find the most desirable weights for each Decision Making Unit (DMU) in order to estimate the highest efficiency score as possible. Usually, decision makers are using these efficiency scores for ranking the DMUs. The main drawback in this process is that the ranking based on weights obtained from the standrad DEA models ignore other feasible weights, this is due to the fact that DEA may have multiple solutions for each DMU. To overcome this problem, Salo and Punkka (2011) deemed each DMU as a \u201cBlack box\u201d and developed a mix-integer model to obtain the ranking intervals for each DMU over sets of all its feasible weights. In many real world applications, there are DMUs that have a two-stage production system. In this paper, we extend the Salo and Punkka (2011)\u2019s model to more common and practical applications considering the two-stage production structure. The proposed approach calculates each DMU\u2019s ranking interval for the overall system as well as ranking interval for each subsystem/sub-stage. An example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach while an application for non-life insurance companies has been discussed to show the usefulness of this method. A real application in Chinese commercial banks shows how this approach can be used by policy makers.",

        "abstract": "Developing an efficient policy to determine the inventory a non-profit organization (NPO) should stockpile to respond to potential disasters plays a vital role in humanitarian relief. Incorporating social donation and emergency spot purchasing, this paper develops a (generalized) two-stage delivery process model to characterize relief materials\u2019 delivery after a disaster. We propose an analytical model that aims to minimize the total costs when all demands incurred by an unexpected disaster need to be fully satisfied. Moreover, we determine that the optimal solution uniquely exists and characterize the effects of key parameters. Last, this paper also develops a risk-sharing scheme, in which the NPO and the supplier jointly stockpile relief materials. Under some mild conditions, we show that implementing the scheme could increase the storage quantity and decrease the total costs simultaneously. Several numerical examples are employed to validate the model, as well as the value of the proposed risk-sharing scheme.",

        "title": "An analysis of intellectual property licensing strategy under duopoly competition: Component or product-based?",
        "abstract": "A component supplier holding patents can calculate the intellectual property licensing fees either as a percentage of sales prices of its customer manufacturersu0027 products (i.e., product-based strategy) or as a percentage of the wholesale price of its component (i.e., component-based strategy). Selecting which strategy to license the patent plays a vital role in supply-chain playersu0027 strategic interactions, especially when the downstream manufacturers compete. This paper investigates which strategy is favored more by players of a supply chain, which consists of a component supplier and two duopoly manufacturers. The manufacturers are assumed to be heterogeneous in production cost but produce and competitively sell homogenous goods. Employing a supplier Stackelberg game model, we demonstrate that the component supplier prefers to implement the product-based strategy; nevertheless, the manufacturersu0027 preferences are dependent on how effectively they produce products. Specifically, the product-based strategy could be favored by the manufacturer with a sufficiently high cost advantage over the rival. Furthermore, we find that the supply-chain playersu0027 preferences of licensing strategy could be dependent on factors such as the market size, the differences of the production costs, and unit royalty fees when the products are imperfect substitutes.",

This paper considers a NPO (a relief agent) that requires stockpiling multiple products for responding multiple potential disaster events. By employing the multi-product newsvendor (MPNV) approach, this paper establishes a multiple relief materials\u2019 storage model that aims to minimise the expected total cost of the NPO. Our model acknowledges that the occurrence of a disaster, the demand after a disaster and the donation after a disaster are uncertain.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Business practices have demonstrated that a contract manufacturer (CM) can introduce an own-label product and thus compete with its original equipment manufacturer (OEM), i.e., factory encroachment, which has not been obtained much attention in literature. Considering a three-level outsourced supply chain consisting of a CM, an OEM, and a retailer, this paper analyzes the impact of factory encroachment on playersu0027 gains. We show that factory encroachment could implement Pareto improvement, i.e., all supply-chain playersu0027 gains increase under encroachment. We also demonstrate that factory encroachment always offers more surplus to the entire supply chain and the consumer. In addition, the most preferred channel for the supply-chain players, the entire supply-chain system, and the consumer are investigated. We find that an encroachment strategy could be simultaneously favored by all involved parties, provided there is no integration between the OEM and the retailer. However, if the OEM and the retailer act as a single entity, only the no-encroachment strategy could be favored by all parties simultaneously.",

The existing carbon allocation approaches are primary based on efficiency maximized principle or efficiency invariance principle. Such two principles, however, are both extreme cases which are particularly difficult to realize in reality. In this study, we proposed an alternative approach based on gradually efficiency improvement planning and emission reduction planning principles. Based on them, the efficiency is planning to be steadily improved after allocating carbon emission year by year rather than achieve the maximized target (efficient) in a single step or maintain the original efficiency without any improvement. Meanwhile, the total carbon emission is also planning to be reduced by a certain percent according to the promise by China in Copenhagen climate conference. Finally, the proposed method is applied to allocate the carbon emission quotas among provinces in China, and some realistic conclusions are obtained to guide in reality.",

Previous data envelopment analysis (DEA) literature on environmental performance measurement often follow the concept of non-radial efficiency measure for calculating the performance on resources and economic-environmental factors respectively. This paper proposes a non-radial and multi-objective generalized DEA model for economic-environmental efficiency evaluation. The results illustrate that this model can not only analyze the relationship between DEA efficiency and Pareto optimality of the multi-objective programming problem defined on the production possibility set, but also obtain the performance improvement direction by using the projection of decision making units. Finally, a case on measuring the economic-environmental performance of Chinese provincial regions is employed to indicate that the proposed model can be helpful to promote the accuracy of economic-environmental efficiency evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Design iteration and time uncertainty are the two basic characteristics in the development process. That makes the development process optimization problem unlike the Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) and can not be solved directly by using the general ant colony algorithm.Through the analysis of the iterated development process,a new idea was proposed that the design activity firstly being visited in the development process would be treated as the city visited by ants in the traveling salesman problem.Then a hybrid ant colony algorithm which integrates the Markov process methods into the general ant colony algorithm was built for solving the development process optimization problem.Case studies demonstrate that the method successfully extended the general ant colony algorithm to the more complicated development process optimization problems.With consideration that the completed times of design activities follow arbitrary distribution and design iteration dose exist,an optimized model has been established which provides a new solution method for the development process optimization problems.",

        "abstract": "Doubly-fed induction generator is widely used in the wind power generation system due to its advantage of controlling active and reactive power independently, and only a percentage of the power produced by the generator has to pass through the AC excitation converter. However, the converter is quite sensitive to grid disturbance because of its limited partial capacity compared with the generator rating. Nowadays the grid code demands that the wind power generator possesses the ability of riding through the grid voltage dips, in order to prevent the more severe successive grid faults. To protect the converter and to support the grid, it is needed to limit the high inrush rotor current and provide a bypass for it via a crowbar, which is connected to the rotor windings. In this paper, a novel crowbar control strategy is proposed to limit the over current in the rotor, the over voltage of the DC bus. Experiment results prove that crowbar circuit is able to improve the LVRT of DFIG system.",

The key of the method is to limit the inrush current in the rotor in order to protect the converter and to provide a bypass for this current via a set of resistors that are connected to the rotor windings. In order to regulate network voltage, stabilize weak network, the DFIG using the proposed method can supply reactive power fast, hold system supply stability, reduce risk of voltage collapse and network splitting.

The electrocatalytic activity and durability measurements exhibit the superior catalytic performance of PtAu/C catalysts over that of Pt/C catalyst on formic acid electrooxidation. Moreover, the initial and final activity after 3600 s reaction of the heat-treated PtAu/C alloy catalyst is two and five times as high as that of the untreated PtAu/C catalyst. The performance enhancement of the PtAu/C catalysts is discussed in terms of the electronic effect and ensemble effect. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

It was discovered that the electrooxidation of formic acid could be promoted greatly by addition of trace amount of vanadium ions. A much greater enhancement in catalytic stability (3.19 times) was observed when compared to the improvement in catalytic activity (1.57 times), indicating the effective protection of Pd from deactivation by addition of vanadium ions into the electrolyte. The improvement in the catalytic performances may be attributed to the facilitating of formic acid elelctrooxidation due to the existence of VO 2+ /V 3+ redox pair and the ensemble effect induced by the adsorption of vanadium ions onto the surface of Pd.",

Here, using a phosphomolybdic acid (PMo 12)-assisted method, a Pd-PMo 12/C catalyst with uniform Pd nanoparticles is prepared. The TEM results show that the presence of PMo 12 facilitates the formation of uniform Pd particles with an average particle size of 3.2 nm. More importantly, the Pd-PMo 12/C catalyst displays an enhanced activity and stability for formic acid electro-oxidation and a better tolerance toward CO poisoning than Pd nanocatalysts prepared with sodium citrate as a stabilizer. A combination of the composition and structure analyses show that the reasons for the improved electro-catalytic activity of the Pd-PMo 12/C catalyst involve the metal-support interaction, the richer Pd oxide/hydrous oxide content and the inherent properties of PMo 12. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The variation in structure/surface composition of the Pt-Pd/C catalysts leaded to different reaction mechanism and varied the performance of formic acid electrooxidation, which were confirmed by the electrochemical tests. The Pd/C catalyst modified with Pt in the presence of Cl- possesses satisfactory comprehensive performance, i.e. both stability and activity, for formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO). The results are of significance for designing catalysts for practical application of direct formic acid fuel cell and understanding mechanism of FAEO on noble metals composite structures. ? 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "The methanol electro-oxidation behaviors on the Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts with various compositions were investigated and compared to those of Pt/C catalyst by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts were prepared by depositing Pt on the MoO x /C support obtained by precipitation-reduction method in advance. The physical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, EDX and TEM. From the results of XRD and TEM, it was shown that the MoO x /C support facilitated the dispersion of Pt particles. All the Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts showed relative lower Mo contents comparing to their nominal values. No PtMo alloy was formed in these catalysts, which were affirmed by XPS and XRD. It was found that all the Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts showed higher mass activity (normalized to the mass of Pt) but lower specific activity (normalized to the electrochemical active surface areas) for methanol oxidation than the Pt/C catalyst. With the increase of Mo contents in Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts, the activities of Pt\u2013MoO x /C catalysts decreased. Combined with the composition and structure analyses, the differences in methanol oxidation on these catalysts were attributed to the interaction between the Pt particles and the MoO x /C support. It was suggested that the Pt metal\u2013MoO x /C support interaction resulted in two effects. One was decreasing the Pt particle size; the other was decreasing the specific activities of these catalysts for methanol oxidation. Comprising these two contradictory effects, the mass activities of these catalysts for methanol oxidation increased.",

The UV-vis spectra indicated that the IL interacted with the Pd precursor to form a complex that plays an important role in the nucleation and growth process of Pd nanoparticles. The IL-mediated synthesis of the Pd/C catalyst (Pd/C-IL) was extensively characterised by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical CO ad stripping, linear scanning voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Physical characterisations revealed that the Pd/C-IL had an average size of 2.8 nm and a narrow size distribution. In addition, a very 'clean' surface was obtained for the Pd nanoparticles due to a weak interaction between the IL and the Pd nanoparticle surface resulting in the facile removal of the IL in the post-treatment process. More importantly, electrochemical studies demonstrated that, at an operating potential of 0.2 V, the catalytic activity of the Pd/C-IL was approximately 1.6 and 4.2-fold greater than the commercial Pd/C catalyst and the common Pd/C catalyst, respectively. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "The control for surface of catalysts is intrinsically required to improve catalytic efficiency. In current work, we demonstrate that the surface of Pt/C catalyst can be effectively reconstructed by ultrasonic mixing with Pb/C in an acidic environment and electorchemical activation process. As a result, the surface-reconstructed Pt/C catalyst exhibits a significant enhancement of activity of a ca. 10-fold improvement in mass activity and a ca. 38-fold improvement in specific activity as compared with a pure Pt/C catalyst for formic acid electroxidation (FAEO). The evidences show that some of Pb species are transferred from Pb/C to surface of Pt/C catalyst probably through the dissolution-adsorption pathway during ultrasonic mixing and electorchemical activation processes. The presence of Pb on surface of Pt not only isolates the continuous Pt sites through the third-body effect but also modifies electronic band structure of platinum via electronic effect, which leads to that the direct pathway is preferably occurred and the CO formation is effectively inhibited. These results provide useful information for further understanding the promotion mechanism of Pb ad-atom during FAEO and rationally controlling the catalytic surface to improve catalytic efficiency. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Abstract This study investigates an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid that serves as the liquid electrolyte (LE) in a passive direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The addition of an LE can reduce methanol crossover and increase the fuel utilization significantly. To improve the performance of an LE-DMFC, a mathematical model is developed to optimize the thicknesses of both the LE layer and the Nafion membrane. The maximum power density of the LE-DMFC is improved by approximately 30% compared with a conventional DMFC (C-DMFC) when each is fed by methanol solutions of the same concentration. Due to the low methanol crossover of the LE-DMFC, a highly concentrated methanol solution can be directly fed into the LE-DMFC. The discharge time and volume energy density of the LE-DMFC are two times longer and three times greater than those of the C-DMFC, respectively. In addition, fuel utilization increases by approximately 100%. Keywords Liquid electrolyte Passive direct methanol fuel cell Mathematical model Methanol crossover Highly concentrated methanol",

The fabrication of healable PEMs that exhibit satisfactory mechanical stability, enhanced proton conductivity, and suppressed methanol permeability via hydrogen-bonding complexation between Nafion and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) followed by postmodification with 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (CBA) molecules is presented. Compared with pure Nafion, the CBA/Nafion-PVA membranes exhibit enhanced mechanical properties with an ultimate tensile strength of \u224820.3 MPa and strain of \u2248380%. The CBA/Nafion-PVA membrane shows a proton conductivity of 0.11 S cm at 80 \u00b0C, which is 1.2-fold higher than that of a Nafion membrane. The incorporated PVA gives the CBA/Nafion-PVA membranes excellent proton conductivity and methanol resistance. The resulting CBA/Nafion-PVA membranes are capable of healing mechanical damage of several tens of micrometers in size and restoring their original proton conductivity and methanol resistance under the working conditions of DMFCs. The healing property originates from the reversibility of hydrogen-bonding interactions between Nafion and CBA-modified PVA and the high chain mobility of Nafion and CBA-modified PVA.",

The catalyst support not only determines the dispersion status of the catalysts particles, but also exerts great influence on the electronic structure of the catalysts, thereby altering its intrinsic activity. Herein, we demonstrated that nitrogen atoms, assisted by the pre-treatment of carbon matrix with oxidants, can be easily doped into carbon nanotubes at low temperature. The obtained nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes can effectively improve the dispersion of the supported platinum nanoparticles and facilitate the MOR by modifying the electronic structure of platinum atoms, through catalyst-support interaction.",

As a result, the significant negative shift of CO oxidation potential was confirmed by an electrochemical characterization. Further, the sensing performance of the as-prepared catalyst was investigated by means of the portable CO sensor device, which showed higher sensitivity, faster response time and good linearity within 50\u00a0ppm CO.",

        "abstract": "In flowering plants, sperm cells are delivered to the embryo sac by a pollen tube guided by female signals. Both the gametic and synergid cells contribute to pollen tube attraction. Synergids secrete peptide signals that lure the tube, while the role of the gametic cells is unknown. Previously, we showed that CENTRAL CELL GUIDANCE (CCG) is essential for pollen tube attraction in Arabidopsis thaliana, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we identified CCG BINDING PROTEIN1 (CBP1) and demonstrated that it interacts with CCG, Mediator subunits, RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and central cell-specific AGAMOUS-like transcription factors. In addition, CCG interacts with TATA-box Binding Protein 1 and Pol II as a TFIIB-like transcription factor. CBP1-knockdown ovules are defective in pollen tube attraction. Expression profiling revealed that cysteine-rich peptide (CRP) transcripts were downregulated in ccg ovules. CCG and CBP1 coregulate a subset of CRPs in the central cell and the synergids, including the attractant LURE1. CBP1 is extensively expressed in multiple vegetative tissues and specifically in the central cell in reproductive growth. We propose that CBP1, via interaction with CCG and the Mediator complex, connects transcription factors and the Pol II machinery to regulate pollen tube attraction.",

        "abstract": "Cells of multi-cellular organisms evolve toward uni-cellularity in the form of cancer and, if humans intervene, continue to evolve in cell culture. During this process, gene dosage relationships may evolve in novel ways to cope with the new environment and may regress back to the ancestral uni-cellular state. In this context, the evolution of sex chromosomes vis-a-vis autosomes is of particular interest. Here, we report the chromosomal evolution in ~ 600 cancer cell lines. Many of them jettisoned either Y or the inactive X; thus, free-living male and female cells converge by becoming 'de-sexualized'. Surprisingly, the active X often doubled, accompanied by the addition of one haploid complement of autosomes, leading to an X:A ratio of 2:3 from the extant ratio of 1:2. Theoretical modeling of the frequency distribution of X:A karyotypes suggests that the 2:3 ratio confers a higher fitness and may reflect aspects of sex chromosome evolution.",

        "abstract": "The t(8;21) chromosome translocation frequently occurs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), resulting in an in-frame fusion between the DNA-binding domain of  AML1  and almost the entire of  ETO  gene. The fusion AML1-ETO protein is thought to play a critical role in the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells, such as Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells. Glucocorticoids (GC) can induce apoptosis in these cells at low concentrations, whereas most other myeloid leukemia cell lines are resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. To experimentally address possible sensitive mechanisms in leukemia cells with AML1-ETO translocation, we generated aGC-resistant Kasumi-1 cell line by induction of 10 -6  M dexamethasone (Dex) for three weeks. The IC 50  of Dex to cells is increased from 2.5\u00d710 -8  M for original GC-sensitive Kasumi-1 cell line ( K-S cell line) to more than 1\u00d710 -5  M for induced GC-resistant Kasumi-1 cell line (K-R cell line). Since GC resistance often results from mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), all the exons of  GR  gene were sequenced and no mutation was found in K-R cells. Comparing to those in K-S cells, the GR protein level didn9t decrease in K-R cells after 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h and 24h exposure to dexamethasone. Given that the difference of direct GR downstream genes between K-S and K-R cells may play a key role in the GC sensitivity, we systematically analyzed the changes of gene expression induced by Dex versus ethanol vehicle for 8h in K-S and K-R cells by high throughput RNA sequencing. The time point of 8h was selected according to the expression peaks of several foregone GR target genes after Dex induction. There were found 32 genes conversely regulated in K-S and K-R cells, including 14 mRNAs and 18 long non-coding RNAs. Pathway analysis indicated that the upregulated genes in K-S cells might promote the AML1-ETO fusion protein degradation by proteasomes, while the component genes of this pathway were downregulated in K-R cells. Further validation and function studies of these mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs are ongoing. Our data suggested that the downstream targets of GR among GC-sensitive and -resistant Kasumi-1 cells were significant different and they may contribute to the GC sensitivity and resistance by degradation or reservation of AML-ETO fusion protein and the regulation of apoptosis in t(8;21) leukemia cell subtype.

Modified nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) was prepared and introduced into the SPAEK-COOH- x  as the \u201cperformance-enhancing\u201d filler and crosslinking agent. The nanocomposite proton exchange membranes were prepared via a solution-casting procedure. The composite membranes containing NCC presented the higher proton conductivity and better mechanical properties. After further crosslinking, the covalent crosslinked composite membranes showed even better mechanical properties while the proton conductivity and thermal stability were maintained. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains were observed from the TEM morphology investigation of COOH-10/NCC- y  and C/COOH-10/NCC- y  membranes. A balance of mechanical stabilities, proton conductivity, and thermal property could be designed by the incorporation of NCC and the crosslinking between NCC and SPAEK-COOH-10 to meet the requirements for the applications in the fuel cells.",

In the group of cases of blood transfusion in whom the infection was caused by one-time blood transfusion before and after 1995, there were 189 cases, of whom 105 cases on HAART were designated as observation group, and 84 cases who were not on HAART were designated as control group. The group of AIDS patients who were former commercial plasma donors (FCPDs) had 120 patients who were identified in the survey of 1995, of whom 63 cases on HAART were designated as observation group and 57 cases who were not on HAART were as control group. Onset dates were defined as the dates into the queue. Death due to AIDS was regarded as an outcome event. Subjects who were enrolled into the observation group and control group were epidemiologically followed up regularly. Observation was ended on December 31, 2010.Mortality of patients after HAART from groups of FCPDs and blood recipients were 4.42/100 person-years and 6.13/100 person-years, respectively. The survival rates of HAART groups were 80% in FCPDs for 110 months and 72% in blood recipients for 90 months, respectively. Meanwhile the mortality of no HAART groups were 182.05/100 person-years and 250.66/100 person-years, respectively. Mean survival of patients whose disease was caused by plasma donation and blood transfusion were 4 months and 3 months, respectively.Whether the HIV infection was caused by plasmapheresis or blood transfusion, the effects of HAART did not show difference. HAART cold reduce the death intensity and prolong survival.",

Sera specimens from 84 children born from 63 HIV-1 positive mothers were screened, using ELISA for HIV-1 antibody, and positive specimens were confirmed by Western-blot.The rate of MTCT was 32.1% (27/84) for children with all risk factors related to MTCT. Another 36.8% (7/19) were related to factors on intrauterine, intrapartum and breastfeeding, 35.7% (5/14) to intrapartum and breastfeeding factors, 14.3% (2/14) to intrauterine and intrapartum factors, 37.9% (11/29) to breastfeeding factor alone. By group combination analysis, the MTCT rate was 36.9% (24/65) with breastfeeding, 11.8% (2/17) with artificial feeding, and the former was significantly higher than the latter.HIV-1 MTCT rate among mothers caused by a single blood transfusion varied with different risk factors. Breastfeeding played an important role in MTCT, appeared in our study.",

The infector cohort by 142 cases was used to estimate incubation period. In the infector cohort, the time which infectors entered the cohort was their infection time, which was the middle value of the origin date, which was January 1, 1995. The onset of AIDS was defined as an outcome event. End point of observation was Dec 31, 2010. There were 192 months in all from beginning to end. The AIDS cohort by 57 cases was used to estimate the survival of the patients. In the patient cohort, the time of AIDS onset was defined as the time entering the cohort, and death of AIDS was defined as an outcome event. The cumulative incidence ratio, cumulative mortality, illness intensity and mortality intensity were analyzed through Kaplan-Meier.During the observation period, 123 cases of 142 infectors developed into AIDS, the cumulative incidence was 86.42% (123/142) and the intensity was 8.53/100 person-years and the median time of incubation period was 112.0 months (95%CI: 108.8 - 115.2). The death dates of 57 patients were from 1 to 24 months after onset. The cumulative mortality was 100%, and the intensity was 250.66/100 person-years and the median survival time was 3.0 months (95%CI: 1.8 - 4.2).

Among 136 patients whose CD4+T cell counts\u2264200/\u03bcl at early therapy,there were 82 cases of opportunistic infections,with the infection rate was 60.3%,while,after 6-month therapy there were only 3 cases of opportunistic infections in 79 patients whose CD4+T cell counts >200/\u03bcl,with infection rate was 3.8%.Conclusion The AIDS patients with CD4+ cell counts over 200/\u03bcl have litter probability to occur opportunistic infection,but the probability will increase obviously when their CD4+ cell counts are below 200/\u03bcl. The opportunistic infections are liable to occur for the AIDS patients with CD4+T cell counts <200/\u03bcl at initial therapy.",

        "abstract": "To study epidemiological features of HIV infection after blood transfusion and the situation of transmission among members of family.The persons infected with HIV through blood transfusion and their intrafamilial transmission in some city were analyzed and testing methods of ELISA, Western-blot, RT-PCR and subtype analyzing were used. The whole surveillance data came from residents investigation around problem medical centres and HIV monitoring network around Hebei province.173 people infected with HIV after blood transfusion in some city, including 89 cases found in hospital and 84 cases in CDC, accounted for 68.7% (173/252) of all of infected persons by blood transfusion in Hebei province. The rate of intrafamilial transmission, spousal transmission and mother-to-child transmission((MTCT) were 32.0% (49/153),17.0% (26/153) and 32.7% (32/98), respectively. Most of persons infected with HIV were youth among who the female were more than the male. Childbearing and women's ailments were the main cause of blood transfusion from 1990 to 1999, and traumatism surgery took second place. Infected persons by HIV blood, whose time to diagnostic were the year from 1999 to 2009, spread over Kangtai hospital and other hospital which accounted for 45.1% (78/173) and 42.2% (73/173), respectively. The genetype of all patients were B' subtype.The medical centers at the grass-roots level in some city resulted in outbreak of infected persons by HIV blood because of having no screening test antibody of HIV for liid blood donors.",

Among those objects being observed during the incubation period, 354 had HIV infections (including 142 cases infected via plasmapheresis and 212 cases caused by transfusion) but had not been treated by HAART before the onset of disease. Objects being observed during the survival period, 141 were AIDS patients (including 57 cases infected via plasmapheresis and 84 cases causes by transfusion) but had not been treated by HAART before and after the onset of disease. All infectors and AIDS patients were under follow-up on the progress of illness or death, respectively.By December 31, 2010, the cumulative incidence among HIV infections was 88.70% (314/354), with the incidence density as 9.14/100 person-years (314/3435.75) and the median incubation period was 113 months. Of 142 HIV infections in the blood donation group and 212 infections in the blood transfusion group, the incubation periods were 112 months and 115 months, respectively. All of the 141 patients died 34 months after the onset, with the death-strength as 204.70/100 person-years (141/68.88) and the period of survival was 4 months. Among those 57 FCPDs infections, they were all died 24 months after the onset, with the death-strength as 250.66/100 person-years (57/22.74) and the survival was 3 months. The other 84 infections who were blood recipients, all died 34 months after the onset, with the death-strength as 182.05/100 person-years (84/ 46.14) and the survival was 4 months.Through this study, we noticed that the natural history of all the AIDS patients was caused by blood transmission. It was important to evaluate the natural history of HIV epidemics among both FCPDs and blood recipients, occurred before and after 1995.",

        "abstract": "A model of doping confined in atomic layers is proposed for atomic-level insights into the effect of doping on photocatalysis. Co doping confined in three atomic layers of In2S3 was implemented with a lamellar hybrid intermediate strategy. Density functional calculations reveal that the introduction of Co ions brings about several new energy levels and increased density of states at the conduction band minimum, leading to sharply increased visible-light absorption and three times higher carrier concentration. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that the electron transfer time of about 1.6\u2005ps from the valence band to newly formed localized states is due to Co doping. The 25-fold increase in average recovery lifetime is believed to be responsible for the increased of electron-hole separation. The synthesized Co-doped In2S3 (three atomic layers) yield a photocurrent of 1.17\u2005mA\u2009cm(-2) at 1.5\u2005V vs. RHE, nearly 10 and 17 times higher than that of the perfect In2S3 (three atomic layers) and the bulk counterpart, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Regulating the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction is particularly challenging. Herein, we propose ideal models of atomic layers with/without element doping to investigate the effect of doping engineering to tune the selectivity of CO2 photoreduction. Prototypical ZnCo2O4 atomic layers with/without Ni-doping were first synthesized. Density functional theory calculations reveal that introducing Ni atoms creates several new energy levels and increases the density-of-states at the conduction band minimum. Synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy demonstrates that the band structures are suitable for CO2 photoreduction, while the surface photovoltage spectra demonstrate that Ni doping increases the carrier separation efficiency. In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectra disclose that the CO2\u00b7\u2212 radical is the main intermediate, while temperature-programed desorption curves reveal that the ZnCo2O4 atomic layers with/without Ni doping favor the respective CO and CH4 desorption. The Ni-doped ZnCo2O4 atomic layers exhibit a 3.5-time higher CO selectivity than the ZnCo2O4 atomic layers. This work establishes a clear correlation between elemental doping and selectivity regulation for CO2 photoreduction, opening new possibilities for tailoring solar-driven photocatalytic behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Summary  To date, infrared (IR) light constituting almost 50% of the solar energy has never been utilized, owing to an insurmountable contradiction between IR light utilization and CO 2  photoreduction. To break through this limitation, we designed an ultrathin intermediate-band semiconductor, and hence first realized IR-driven CO 2  overall splitting on a single material without using any sacrificial reductants. Taking the synthetic ultrathin cubic-WO 3  layers as an example, theoretical calculations disclose that the created oxygen vacancies reaching a critical density results in an intermediate band, verified by synchrotron-radiation valence-band spectra, photoluminescence spectra, UV-vis-NIR spectra, and synchrotron-radiation IR reflectance spectra. As a result, the oxygen-deficient WO 3  atomic layers display IR-driven CO 2  overall splitting to CO and O 2 , while their catalytic activity proceeds without deactivation even after 3\u00a0days. Also, the higher oxygen vacancy concentration favors CO 2  adsorption and activation into COOH* radical, affirmed by CO 2  temperature-programmed desorption spectra and  in situ  FTIR spectra, hence guaranteeing increased CO and O 2  formation rates.",

Herein, we employ defect engineering to fully optimize these crucial processes. As a prototype, we initially fabricate BiOBr atomic layers, and hence deliberately create abundant oxygen vacancies on their surfaces, affirmed by near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Theoretical calculations unveil the new defect level resulting from oxygen vacancy extends photo-response to visible-light region, while the charge delocalization around oxygen vacancies contributes to CO2 activation into COOH* intermediate, confirmed by in-situ FTIR spectra. Surface photovoltage spectra and time-resolved fluorescence emission decay spectra disclose the introduced oxygen vacancies ensure promoted carrier separation efficiency. As a result, the oxygen-deficient BiOBr atomic layers achieve visible-light-driven CO2 reduction with CO formation rate of 87.4 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1, which was not only 20 times and 24 times higher than that of the BiOBr atomic layers and bulk BiOBr, but also outperformed most previously reported single photocatalysts under comparable conditions.",

Here, we design an ultrathin conductor system, in which the special partially occupied band serves as the mediator to simultaneously guarantee IR light harvesting and satisfied band-edge positions, while the ultrathin configuration improves charge separation rates and surface redox kinetics. Taking the low cost and earth abundant CuS as an example, we first fabricate ultrathin CuS layers, where temperature-dependent resistivities, valence-band spectrum and theoretical calculation affirm their metallic nature. Synchrotron-radiation photoelectron and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectra unveil metallic CuS atomic layers could realize a new cooperative intraband-interband transition under IR light irradiation, where the generated electrons and holes could simultaneously involve the carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation reactions. As a result, CuS atomic layers exhibit nearly 100% selective CO production with an evolution rate of 14.5 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1 under IR light irradiation, while the catalytic performance shows no obvious decay after 96 h test. Briefly, benefiting from ultrahigh conductivity and unique partially occupied band, the abundant conductor materials such as conducting metal sulfides and metal nitrides hold great promise for applications as effective IR light responsive photocatalysts.",

        "abstract": "High electrical conductivity and large amount of active sites are the two prerequisites for an efficient electrocatalyst. Doping engineering is widely utilized to tailor the electrical property, while investigation on the dopant-induced modification of active sites remains elusive. To address this issue, we construct an ideal model of atomically-thin layers and hence deliberately create element doping on their surface. As an example, freestanding N-doped MoO3 single-layers are first synthesized by virtue of a lamellar intermediate. Positron annihilation spectrometry discloses that N-doping leads to increased Vo\u00b7\u00b7Vo\u00b7\u00b7 divacancies relative to intact MoO3 single-layers, while the similar electrochemical active area implies that the increased Vo\u00b7\u00b7Vo\u00b7\u00b7 divacancies accounts for the former's 6 times higher H2 evolution activity. In addition, density-functional calculations revealed that the presence of Vo\u00b7\u00b7Vo\u00b7\u00b7 divacancies results in increased states density near the valence band edge, which favors their improved electronic conductivity, verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work demonstrates that N-doping confined in MoO3 atomic-layers increase the concentration of Vo\u00b7\u00b7Vo\u00b7\u00b7 divacancies, which are first verified to be highly active sites for H2 evolution. Thus, doping engineering in atomic-layers opens new opportunities for achieving efficient catalytic performances through tailoring the catalytically active sites.",

        "abstract": "Photoreduction of CO2 into fuels over TiO2 helps to relieve the increasing energy crisis and the worsening global climate, while the low energetic efficiency impedes its large-scale applications. Herein, ultrathin TiO2 flakes are first put forward to fully optimize their crucial CO2 photoreduction processes through affording abundant catalytically active sites and increased two-dimensional conductivity. 1.66 nm thick TiO2 flakes are successfully fabricated by virtue of lamellar TiO\u22122 octylamine hybrid. The atomic thickness endows TiO2 with ultrahigh fraction of surface atoms, which ensures stronger UV light absorption compared with its bulk counterpart. Benefiting from the increased density of states near Fermi level and the vast majority of charge density concentrating on the surface, the ultrathin TiO2 flakes show increased conductivity confirmed by the temperature-dependent resistivities. The 3 times higher fluorescence lifetime, revealed by the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, accounts for the increased separate rate of photoexcited electron-hole pairs. As an outcome, the ultrathin TiO2 flakes achieve a formate formation rate of 1.9 \u03bcmol g\u22121 h\u22121, 450 times higher than that of bulk counterpart and also roughly 2 times higher than that of previously reported Ag-modified BaLa4Ti4O15. Briefly, our study will unlock many opportunities for designing efficient CO2 photoreduction performance.",

        "abstract": "The bottleneck in water electrolysis lies in the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, conceptually new metallic non-metal atomic layers are proposed to overcome this drawback. Metallic single-unit-cell CoSe2 sheets with an orthorhombic phase are synthesized by thermally exfoliating a lamellar CoSe2 -DETA hybrid. The metallic character of orthorhombic CoSe2 atomic layers, verified by DFT calculations and temperature-dependent resistivities, allows fast oxygen evolution kinetics with a lowered overpotential of 0.27\u2005V. The single-unit-cell thickness means 66.7\u2009% of the Co(2+) ions are exposed on the surface and serve as the catalytically active sites. The lowered Co(2+) coordination number down to 1.3 and 2.6, gives a lower Tafel slope of 64\u2005mV\u2009dec(-1) and higher turnover frequency of 745\u2005h(-1) . Thus, the single-unit-cell CoSe2 sheets have around 2 and 4.5 times higher catalytic activity compared with the lamellar CoSe2 -DETA hybrid and bulk CoSe2 . ",

However, studies on how mobile social network affects knowledge workersu0027 attention management are lagging. In this research-in-progress, we attempt to fill the research gap by developing a research model to understand the underlying mechanism. Based on the resource allocation theory, we propose that mobile social network engagement affects focused attention, and the effect varies upon the social network content. Extending the unconscious thought theory, we propose that focused attention affects task performance, and task types moderate this relationship. A laboratory experiment will be conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. This study has both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study is effective in understanding how mobile social network usage affects knowledge workersu0027 focused attention and task performance. Practically, this study sheds light upon how to manage the use of mobile social network in the workplace.",

This paper proposes a driver risk classification model to evaluate the risk level of drivers based on in-car sensor data. A Behavior-centric Vehicle Insurance Pricing model (BVIP) and a vehicle premium calculation prototype are developed in this paper. Based on empirical data, our research results show that BVIP achieves better accuracy in terms of risk-level classification and the prototype achieves good performance in terms of effectiveness and usability.",

This paper studies the optimal dynamic pricing strategy based on market segmentation for service products in the online distribution channel taking hotel rooms as an example. Firstly, the pricing model is built to maximize the hotel profit through a dynamic process. Then the solution methodologies based on Chebyshev's Sum Inequality and dynamic programming are provided for the linear demand case and non-linear demand case, respectively. The optimal number of segments and optimal boundaries can be obtained. The results suggest that an appropriate policy of market segmentation in using of online reservation systems is benefit for the service suppliers as well as the consumers. Finally, an illustration based on a 300-room hotel is provided for the more realistic non-linear case. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Changes in consumer behavior due to a personal carbon trading (PCT) scheme are theoretically attractive, yet untested in practice. In this paper, simulations on the basis of an equilibrium model are used to examine the effects of carbon allowance prices on energy use choice under a particular PCT scheme. It is shown that the equilibrium price of allowances would emerge under the PCT scheme considered here. Further analyses indicate that the quantity of energy consumption under PCT is a nonlinear function of the allowance price, with a sharp kink at the point of equilibrium. When the allowance price is below the equilibrium price, consumers would prefer higher-carbon energy. In contrast, when the allowance price is above the equilibrium price, consumers would choose lower-carbon energy. However, when the allowance price equals the equilibrium value, consumers would purchase lower-carbon energy and higher-carbon energy simultaneously. Furthermore, it is shown that the initial allowance allocation could also affect energy use choice. On the basis of these results, one of the main implications is that the allowance price should exceed the breakeven price to stimulate consumers to switch to green energy and progressively live a low-carbon lifestyle.",

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have been regarded as one of the most promising green technologies to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption from the transport sector. Understanding and exploring the factors that affect consumer\u2019s intention to adopt EVs is important. The main purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of consumer\u2019s knowledge about EVs, perceived risk, perceived usefulness and current financial incentive policies on consumer\u2019s intention to adopt EVs using an extended technology acceptance model. The model is empirically tested using questionnaire survey data collected from 320 consumers in China. The results shown that consumer\u2019s knowledge about EVs is positively and significantly related to perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to adopt EVs, but negatively and significantly related to perceived risk. Perceived risk negatively affects perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to adopt EVs. Meanwhile, perceived usefulness has a positive effect on adoption intention and attitude, and attitude is also positively related to the intention to adopt EVs. However, the results also indicate that the financial incentive policy has no significant effect on intention to adopt EVs. In addition, the results also find that consumers lacking of knowledge about EVs and perceiving high risk of EVs could be the psychological barriers to their acceptance of EVs. Based on the results, policy implications for increasing the adoption of EVs and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Aortic valve (AV) disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The preferred treatment modality for severe AV disease is surgical resection and replacement of the native valve with either a mechanical or tissue prosthetic. In order to develop effective and long-lasting treatment methods, computational analyses, e.g., structural finite element (FE) and computational fluid dynamic simulations, are very effective for studying valve biomechanics. These computational analyses are based on mesh models of the aortic valve, which are usually constructed from 3D CT images though many hours of manual annotation, and therefore an automatic valve shape reconstruction method is desired. In this paper, we present a method for estimating the aortic valve shape from 3D cardiac CT images, which is represented by triangle meshes. We propose a pipeline for aortic valve shape estimation which includes novel algorithms for building local shape dictionaries and for building landmark detectors and curve detectors using local shape dictionaries. The method is evaluated on real patient image dataset using a leave-one-out approach and achieves an average accuracy of 0.69 mm. The work will facilitate automatic patient-specific computational modeling of the aortic valve.",

        "abstract": "Geometric features of the aorta are linked to patient risk of rupture in the clinical decision to electively repair an ascending aortic aneurysm (AsAA). Previous approaches have focused on relationship between intuitive geometric features (e.g., diameter and curvature) and wall stress. This work investigates the feasibility of a machine learning approach to establish the linkages between shape features and FEA-predicted AsAA rupture risk, and it may serve as a faster surrogate for FEA associated with long simulation time and numerical convergence issues. This method consists of four main steps: (1) constructing a statistical shape model (SSM) from clinical 3D CT images of AsAA patients; (2) generating a dataset of representative aneurysm shapes and obtaining FEA-predicted risk scores defined as systolic pressure divided by rupture pressure (rupture is determined by a threshold criterion); (3) establishing relationship between shape features and risk by using classifiers and regressors; and (4) evaluating such relationship in cross-validation. The results show that SSM parameters can be used as strong shape features to make predictions of risk scores consistent with FEA, which lead to an average risk classification accuracy of 95.58% by using support vector machine and an average regression error of 0.0332 by using support vector regression, while intuitive geometric features have relatively weak performance. Compared to FEA, this machine learning approach is magnitudes faster. In our future studies, material properties and inhomogeneous thickness will be incorporated into the models and learning algorithms, which may lead to a practical system for clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "To conduct a patient-specific computational modeling of the aortic valve, 3-D aortic valve anatomic geometries of an individual patient need to be reconstructed from clinical 3-D cardiac images. Currently, most of computational studies involve manual heart valve geometry reconstruction and manual finite element (FE) model generation, which is both time-consuming and prone to human errors. A seamless computational modeling framework, which can automate this process based on machine learning algorithms, is desirable, as it can not only eliminate human errors and ensure the consistency of the modeling results but also allow fast feedback to clinicians and permits a future population-based probabilistic analysis of large patient cohorts. In this study, we developed a novel computational modeling method to automatically reconstruct the 3-D geometries of the aortic valve from computed tomographic images. The reconstructed valve geometries have built-in mesh correspondence, which bridges harmonically for the consequent FE modeling. The proposed method was evaluated by comparing the reconstructed geometries from 10 patients with those manually created by human experts, and a mean discrepancy of 0.69\u00a0mm was obtained. Based on these reconstructed geometries, FE models of valve leaflets were developed, and aortic valve closure from end systole to middiastole was simulated for 7 patients and validated by comparing the deformed geometries with those manually created by human experts, and a mean discrepancy of 1.57\u00a0mm was obtained. The proposed method offers great potential to streamline the computational modeling process and enables the development of a preoperative planning system for aortic valve disease diagnosis and treatment.",

Previous approaches largely relied on either computationally expensive finite element models or simplifications of the geometry or material models. In this study, we investigated a new inverse method based on aortic wall stress computation. This approach consists of the following two steps: (1) computing an \"almost true\" stress field from the in vivo geometries and loading conditions, (2) building an objective function based on the \"almost true\" stress fields, constitutive equations and deformation relations, and estimating the material parameters by minimizing the objective function. The method was validated through numerical experiments by using the in vivo data from four ascending aortic aneurysm (AsAA) patients. The results demonstrated that the method is computationally efficient. This novel approach may facilitate the personalized biomechanical analysis of aortic tissues in clinical applications, such as in the rupture risk analysis of ascending aortic aneurysms.",

In this study, by using machine learning (ML) techniques, we developed a ML-model to estimate the zero-pressure geometry of human thoracic aorta by given two pressurized geometries of the same patient at two different blood pressure levels. For the ML-model development, a FEA-based method was used to generate a dataset of aorta geometries of 3125 virtual patients. The ML-model, which was trained and tested on the dataset, is capable of recovering zero-pressure geometries consistent with those generated by the FEA-based method. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using ML techniques as a fast surrogate of FEA-based inverse methods to recover zero-pressure geometries of human organs.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that residual deformations/stresses alter the mechanical behavior of arteries, e.g., the pressure-diameter curves. In an effort to enable personalized analysis of the aortic wall stress, approaches have been developed to incorporate experimentally derived residual deformations into in vivo loaded geometries in finite element simulations using thick-walled models. Solid elements are typically used to account for \"bending-like\" residual deformations. Yet, the difficulty in obtaining patient-specific residual deformations and material properties has become one of the biggest challenges of these thick-walled models. In thin-walled models, fortunately, static determinacy offers an appealing prospect that allows for the calculation of the thin-walled membrane stress without patient-specific material properties. The membrane stress can be computed using forward analysis by enforcing an extremely stiff material property as penalty treatment, which is referred to as the forward penalty approach. However, thin-walled membrane elements, which have zero bending stiffness, are incompatible with the residual deformations, and therefore, it is often stated as a limitation of thin-walled models. In this paper, by comparing the predicted stresses from thin-walled models and thick-walled models, we demonstrate that the transmural mean stress is approximately the same for the two models and can be readily obtained from in vivo clinical images without knowing the patient-specific material properties and residual deformations. Computation of patient-specific mean stress can be greatly simplified by using the forward penalty approach, which may be clinically valuable.",

        "abstract": "SummaryTo conduct a patient-specific computational modeling of the aortic valve, 3D aortic valve anatomic geometries of an individual patient need to be reconstructed from clinical 3D cardiac images. Currently, most of computational studies involve manual heart valve geometry reconstruction and manual FE model generation, which is both time-consuming and prone to human errors. A seamless computational modeling framework, which can automate this process based on machine learning algorithms, is desirable, as it can not only eliminate human errors and ensure the consistency of the modeling results, but also allows fast feedback to clinicians and permits a future population-based probabilistic analysis of large patient cohorts. In this study, we developed a novel computational modeling method to automatically reconstruct the 3D geometries of the aortic valve from CT images. The reconstructed valve geometries have built-in mesh correspondence, which bridges harmonically for the consequent FE modeling. The proposed method was evaluated by comparing the reconstructed geometries from ten patients to those manually created by human experts, and a mean discrepancy of 0.69\u2009mm was obtained. Based on these reconstructed geometries, FE models of valve leaflets were developed, and aortic valve closure from end systole to mid-diastole was simulated for seven patients and validated by comparing the deformed geometries to those manually created by human experts, and a mean discrepancy of 1.57\u2009mm was obtained. The proposed method offers great potential to streamline the computational modeling process and enables the development of a pre-operative planning system for aortic valve disease diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Biological collagenous tissues comprised of networks of collagen fibers are suitable for a broad spectrum of medical applications owing to their attractive mechanical properties. In this study, we developed a noninvasive approach to estimate collagenous tissue elastic properties directly from microscopy images using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium (GLBP) tissue, widely used in the fabrication of bioprosthetic heart valves and vascular patches, was chosen to develop a representative application. A Deep Learning model was designed and trained to process second harmonic generation (SHG) images of collagen networks in GLBP tissue samples, and directly predict the tissue elastic mechanical properties. The trained model is capable of identifying the overall tissue stiffness with a classification accuracy of 84%, and predicting the nonlinear anisotropic stress-strain curves with average regression errors of 0.021 and 0.031. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the Deep Learning approach for fast and noninvasive assessment of collagenous tissue elastic properties from microstructural images.In this study, we developed, to our best knowledge, the first Deep Learning-based approach to estimate the elastic properties of collagenous tissues directly from noninvasive second harmonic generation images. The success of this study holds promise for the use ofMachine Learning techniques to noninvasively and efficiently estimate the mechanical properties of many structure-based biological materials, and italso enables many potential applications such as serving as a quality control tool to select tissue for the manufacturing of medical devices (e.g. bioprosthetic heart valves).",

        "abstract": "It is well known that residual deformations/stresses alter the mechanical behavior of arteries, e.g. the pressure-diameter curves. In an effort to enable personalized analysis of the aortic wall stress, approaches have been developed to incorporate experimentally-derived residual deformations into in vivo loaded geometries in finite element simulations using thick-walled models. Solid elements are typically used to account for 9bending-like9 residual deformations. Yet, the difficulty in obtaining patient-specific residual deformations and material properties has become one of the biggest challenges of these thick-walled models. In thin-walled models, fortunately, static determinacy offers an appealing prospect that allows for the calculation of the thin-walled membrane stress without patient-specific material properties. The membrane stress can be computed using forward analysis by enforcing an extremely stiff material property as penalty treatment, which is referred to as the forward penalty approach. However, thin-walled membrane elements, which have zero bending stiffness, are incompatible with the residual deformations, and therefore, it is often stated as a limitation of thin-walled models. In this paper, by comparing the predicted stresses from thin-walled models and thick-walled models, we demonstrate that the transmural mean hoop stress is the same for the two models and can be readily obtained from in vivo clinical images without knowing the patient-specific material properties and residual deformations. Computation of patient-specific mean hoop stress can be greatly simplified by using membrane model and the forward penalty approach, which may be clinically valuable.",

A generic TAV model is parametrized by mathematical equations describing its 2D shape and its 3D stent-leaflet assembly line. Material properties previously obtained for bovine (BP) and porcine pericardium (PP) via a combination of flexural and biaxial tensile testing were incorporated into the finite element (FE) model of TAV. A Bayesian optimization approach was employed to investigate about 1000 leaflet designs for each material under the nominal circular deployment and physiological loading conditions. The optimal parameter values of the TAV model were obtained, corresponding to leaflet shapes that can reduce the peak stress by 16.7% in BP and 18.0% in PP, compared with that from the initial generic TAV model. Furthermore, it was observed that while peak stresses tend to concentrate near the stent-leaflet attachment edge, optimized geometries benefit from more uniform stress distributions in the leaflet circumferential direction. Our analysis also showed that increasing leaflet contact area redistributes peak stresses to the belly region contributing to peak stress reduction. The results from this study may inspire new TAV designs that can have better durability.",

With the rising concerns of compulsive smartphone use, understanding how smartphone users develop compulsive behaviors is crucial. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of flow in the formation of compulsive smartphone use. Drawing upon the flow theory, we incorporate the psychological state of flow as a key factor in our research model. We identify its determinants based on the desirability\u2013feasibility perspective and reinforcement sensitivity theory. We empirically test our model by conducting an online survey with 384 valid responses. We expect that our findings can provide noteworthy insights on the formation of compulsive smartphone use.",

        "abstract": "Smartphones have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, it may be addiction-prone and result in negative outcomes. Given that relevant research remains limited, this study attempts to address two research gaps in the extant information systems literature. First, research on the determinants of smartphone addiction remains scarce. Second, the role of individual characteristics (i.e., gender) in the formation of smartphone addiction is far from clear. To fill these research gaps, this study develops a research model of smartphone addiction from the functionalist perspective and highlights the moderating role of gender with the insight of social orientation. We propose four categories of motives, including enhancement (i.e., perceived enjoyment), social (i.e., social relationship), coping (i.e., mood regulation and pastime), and conformity motives (i.e., conformity). Empirical results from our online survey illustrate that perceived enjoyment, mood regulation, pastime, and conformity positively affect smartphone addiction, whereas social relationship has no significant effect. Moreover, we find that gender moderates the effects of perceived enjoyment, pastime, and conformity on smartphone addiction. We expect that this study can enrich the theoretical understanding of how motives play different roles in the development of smartphone addiction. Implications are offered for both research and practice.",

        "abstract": "Laser-direct writing (LDW) and magneto-rheological drawing lithography (MRDL) have been proposed for the fabrication of a flexible microneedle array electrode (MAE) for wearable bio-signal monitoring. Conductive patterns were directly written onto the flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate by LDW. The microneedle array was rapidly drawn and formed from the droplets of curable magnetorheological fluid with the assistance of an external magnetic field by MRDL. A flexible MAE can maintain a stable contact interface with curved human skin due to the flexibility of the PET substrate. Compared with Ag/AgCl electrodes and flexible dry electrodes (FDE), the electrode-skin interface impedance of flexible MAE was the minimum even after a 50-cycle bending test. Flexible MAE can record electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG) and static electrocardiography (ECG) signals with good fidelity. The main features of the dynamic ECG signal recorded by flexible MAE are the most distinguishable with the least moving artifacts. Flexible MAE is an attractive candidate electrode for wearable bio-signal monitoring.",

In this Letter, a nanosecond pulsed laser is used to prepare the micro-scaled groove on WC-8Co cermet under different scanning speeds. It is observed that as the scanning speed increases, the ablated trace morphology in the first scanning pass transits from a succession of intermittent deep dimples to the consecutive overlapped shallow pits. The test result also indicates that ablated trace morphology with respect to the low scanning speed stems from a plume shielding effect. Moreover, the ablation regime considering the shielding effect in micro-groove formation process is clarified. The critical scanning speed that can circumvent the shielding effect is also summarized with respect to different laser powers.",

        "abstract": "With natural evolution, honeybee stinger with micro barbs can easily penetrate and trapped in the skin of hostile animals to inject venoum for self-defense. We proposed a novel 3D additive manufacturing method named magnetorheological drawing lithography (MRDL) to efficiently fabricate the bio-inspired microneedle imitating honeybee stinger. Under the assistance of external magnetic field, a parent microneedle was directly drawn on the pillar tip and tilted micro barbs were subsequently formed on the four sides of parent microneedle. Compared with barbless microneedle, the micro-structured barbs enable the bio-inspired microneedle easy skin insertion and difficult removal. The extraction-penetration force ratio of bio-inspired microneedle was triple of the barbless microneedle. The stress concentrations at the barbs helps to reduce the insertion force of bio-inspired microneedle by minimizing the frictional force while increase the adhesion force by interlocking barbs in the tissue during retraction. Such finds may provide an inspiration for the further design of barbed microtip-based microneedle for tissue adhesion, transdermal drug delivery, bio-signal recording, and so on.",

However, porous MA received relatively less attention due to their complex fabrication process and ease of fracturing. Here, we present a titanium porous microneedle array (TPMA) fabricated by modified metal injection molding (MIM) technology. The sintering process is simple and suitable for mass production. TPMA was sintered at a sintering temperature of 1250\u00b0C for 2 h. The porosity of TPMA was approximately 30.1% and its average pore diameter was about 1.3 \u03bcm. The elements distributed on the surface of TPMA were only Ti and O, which may guarantee the biocompatibility of TPMA. TPMA could easily penetrate the skin of a human forearm without fracture. TPMA could diffuse dry Rhodamine B stored in micropores into rabbit skin. The cumulative permeated flux of calcein across TPMA with punctured skin was 27 times greater than that across intact skin. Thus, TPMA can continually and efficiently deliver a liquid drug through open micropores in skin.",

A modified hot embossing approach is proposed to fabricate the GPMA from poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) powders within a cavity array mold under the coupling combination of gradient thermal and pressure multi-fields. The porosity of the microneedles is a gradient, and the pores are mainly distributed in the tip region. The liquid drug formulation can directly be loaded in the pores of the microneedle tips by dipping. GPMA could penetrate into the rabbit skin without breakage and the penetration force per microneedle is approximately 22\u202fmN. The GPMA can diffuse a dry model drug, namely Rhodamine B, in vitro in the rabbit skin dermis. The GPMA can also effectively deliver an insulin solution in vivo in diabetes rats, lowering the blood glucose levels. Above all, as a dry or liquid drug carrier and a minimally invasive injector, the GPMA offers an effective alternative for transdermal drug delivery.",

Micro-cracks form under the recast layer of glass due to the thermal expansion and contraction strain induced by the plasma during LIPAA. This \u201cdefect\u201d, micro-cracks, can be further developed into tree-like micro-textures as the recast layer is removed by chemical corrosion. The effects of chemical corrosion, including corrosive time and corrosive concentration, on the micromorphology of surface texture were investigated. Several representative textures on channel surface were obtained. In order to fabricate micro-channels with micro-texture surface, the effecting factors of LIPAA, including number of scanning cycles, scanning speed, pulse power density and gap distance between glass and sacrificial material, on the channel geometry and chemical corrosive rate were also investigated. The results show that the gap distance is the most significant influence factor on the channel width before chemical corrosion. The corrosive rate of channel width increases with power density and decreases with gap distance. The channel depth before corrosion and its corrosive rate increase with power density and decrease with scanning speed and gap distance. The corrosive rate of width and depth increases with number of scanning cycles till 150, and then reaches steady. The micro-channel with micro-texture surface fabricated by LIPAA and chemical corrosion can be potentially applied in some microfluidic devices.",

The micro-grooved texture was prepared on WC-10Ni 3 Al cermet by laser surface texturing, and its wear resistance in contact with Ti6Al4V was evaluated through the reciprocating sliding wear test. The textured WC-8Co cermet was utilized as a contrastive sample. The test results illustrated that the wear resistance of the micro-groove on WC-10Ni 3 Al was superior to that on WC-8Co, in terms of friction coefficient, wear loss of the counter-pair, and characteristics of the worn surface. The better wear resistance of the micro-groove on WC-10Ni 3 Al cermet is resulted from the synergistic effects of relatively slighter WC grain growth during laser machining and milder element diffusion in the sliding friction process.",

        "abstract": "Laser micromachining technology is a method of precision manufacturing that is experiencing growth with wide applications. Due to the increasingly tense energy situation, it is an appropriate time to consider the efficiency and economic issues of growth in precision manufacturing. The reutilization of a reflected laser beam (RRLB) for modifying metallic materials with low laser absorption is proposed in this article to reduce the energy and time consumption of the laser micromachining process. The novel laser machining approach, using an RRLB, which combined a nanosecond laser with an RRLB optical system of fiber laser, was applied on 6061 aluminum to validate its superior characteristics. The characteristics of the RRLB were clarified by the experiment on 6061 aluminum. Compared with normal laser machining (NLM), the processing efficiency of the RRLB can be greatly improved. Owing to the reutilization of the reflected laser beam energy without a thermal relaxation time, a higher-intensity laser-metal interaction can be realized for the RRLB; thus, the incoming energy can be utilized more effectively by ablating more material instead of diffusing it into the sample. Moreover, practical examples by using the RRLB, such as surface darkening on 6061 aluminum, surface polishing on additive manufactured Al alloy, and surface colorization on titanium and stainless steel, also demonstrated the excellent versatility and superiority of the RRLB approach.",

        "abstract": "It is important to accurately determine the response of spring and autumn phenology to climate change in forest ecosystems, as phenological variations affect carbon balance, forest productivity, and biodiversity. We observed phenology intensively throughout spring and autumn in a temperate deciduous woodlot at Milwaukee, WI, USA, during 2007-2012. Twenty-four phenophase levels in spring and eight in autumn were recorded for 106 trees, including white ash, basswood, white oak, boxelder, red oak, and hophornbeam. Our phenological progression models revealed that accumulated degree-days and day length explained 87.9-93.4 % of the variation in spring canopy development and 75.8-89.1 % of the variation in autumn senescence. In addition, the timing of community-level spring and autumn phenophases and the length of the growing season from 1871 to 2012 were reconstructed with the models developed. All simulated spring phenophases significantly advanced at a rate from 0.24 to 0.48\u00a0days/decade (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) during the 1871-2012 period and from 1.58 to 2.00\u00a0days/decade (p\u2009<\u20090.02) during the 1970-2012 period; two simulated autumn phenophases were significantly delayed at a rate of 0.37 (mid-leaf coloration) and 0.50 (full-leaf coloration) days/decade (p\u2009<\u20090.01) during the 1970-2012 period. Consequently, the simulated growing season lengthened at a rate of 0.45 and 2.50\u00a0days/decade (p\u2009<\u2009=0.001), respectively, during the two periods. Our results further showed the variability of responses to climate between early and late spring phenophases, as well as between leaf coloration and leaf fall, and suggested accelerating simulated ecosystem responses to climate warming over the last four decades in comparison to the past 142\u00a0years.

        "abstract": "Climate influences geographic differences of vegetation phenology through both contemporary and historical variability. The latter effect is embodied in vegetation heterogeneity underlain by spatially varied genotype and species compositions tied to climatic adaptation. Such long-term climatic effects are difficult to map and therefore often neglected in evaluating spatially explicit phenological responses to climate change. In this study we demonstrate a way to indirectly infer the portion of land surface phenology variation that is potentially contributed by underlying genotypic differences across space. The method undertaken normalized remotely sensed vegetation start-of-season (or greenup onset) with a cloned plants-based phenological model. As the geography of phenological model prediction (first leaf) represents the instantaneous effect of contemporary climate, the normalized land surface phenology potentially reveals vegetation heterogeneity that is related to climatic adaptation. The study was done at the continental scale for the conterminous U.S., with a focus on the eastern humid temperate domain. Our findings suggest that, in an analogous scenario, if a uniform contemporary climate existed everywhere, spring vegetation greenup would occur earlier in the north than in the south. This is in accordance with known species-level clinal variations\u2014for many temperate plant species, populations adapted to colder climates require less thermal forcing to initiate growth than those in warmer climates. This study, for the first time, shows that such geographic adaption relationships are supported at the ecosystem level. Mapping large-scale vegetation climate adaptation patterns contributes to our ability to better track geographically varied phenological responses to climate change.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Vegetation phenology is an important indicator of climate change impacts on the seasonal dynamics of the biosphere. However, little is known about the influence of elevation on spring phenological sensitivity to temperature in an alpine ecosystem. Based on remotely sensed land surface phenology and temperature data from 2001 to 2010, this study investigated the rate of spring phenological change of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) grasslands in response to interannual temperature variations at different elevations. Results suggest that spring phenology in the TP grasslands exhibits a stronger response to changes in temperature at higher elevations than at lower ones. In particular, spring phenology advanced by 1\u20132 days in response to a 1 \u00b0C increase in May average temperature at elevations from 3,000 to 3,500 m, while the rate was up to 8\u20139 days/\u00b0C at 5,000\u20135,500 m. Analysis using accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) from January 1 through May 31 showed the same general trend with increased elevation associated with increased sensitivity (as measured by phenological change per unit of AGDD change). Such temperature sensitivity gradients in the TP grasslands could be partly explained by the growth efficiency hypothesis which suggests that vegetation adapted to colder climates likely requires less heat energy for the onset of growing season and vice versa in warmer climates. Furthermore, accumulated growing degree days from January 1 to the greenup date were found to decrease with increasing elevations, which provided evidence to support the applicability of the growth efficiency hypothesis in an alpine grassland ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Climate change is likely to induce range divergence of invasive herbivore insects and native host trees given their different response rates to temperature increase. In this study we used the invasion of emerald ash borer (EAB,  Fairmaire), which is host-specific to ash ( spp.), to demonstrate the significant implications of this climate change induced insect-host divergence for management of invasive species. The least constrained climatic limits of EAB were derived from its native range in East Asia, then projected to North America under the current and future climate conditions, and finally compared with the assumedly static ash distribution. Results suggest that the divergence between the invasion range of EAB and the distribution of ash in North America is likely to enlarge as climate change proceeds. In this case, many original ash stands could remain intact in the southern range, possibly forming refugia of the host species. The realization of this prediction, however, requires that the spread of EAB be reduced by continued management effort to allow climate change to take effect in time. Our study highlights the important role climate change has in the course of biological invasion and herbivore-host dynamics, which provides key information for continental scale pest risk prediction and strategic planning.",

Spring leaf-out of trees with northern provenances occurred later in 2013, but slightly earlier in 2014, than those with southern provenances. This difference was potentially caused by the counterbalancing effect of chilling and forcing in response to interannual temperature fluctuations. In both years, leaf senescence of white ash occurred significantly earlier for trees with northern than southern provenances, reflecting strong adaptation to a photoperiod gradient. The growing season length for white ash, therefore, is constrained by spring and fall phenology through...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A wide range of intra- and interspecific variation occurs in spring leaf phenology as a result of biotic factors such as, life strategy, ecological niche and genetic adaptation, and abiotic factors such as environmental condition. Whereas knowing when the start of bud-burst occurs is necessary for determining the beginning of the growing season, and the subsequent start of carbon uptake, the duration of phenophases is equally important (to estimate the rate of carbon uptake, for example), but rarely reported. Here, we investigate variation in the timing and duration of 3 key phenophase categories (bud-open, leaf-out, full-leaf unfolded) from a range of 8 broadleaf and 2 conifer species in a mixed forest in northern Wisconsin, USA over a 5-year period. As expected, the start of each phenophase category varied across species and years and an earlier start to one phenophase did not necessarily result in an earlier start to subsequent phenophases nor did it mean a faster or slower progression. Ecological niche was not always a useful predictor of the timing or duration of the spring phenology season. The spring phenology season from bud-burst to full leaf open for the entire forest community took an average of 13\u00a0days ranging from 12 to 18\u00a0days across species. Bud-open and leaf-out lasted an average of 4\u00a0days whereas, full-leaf unfolding lasted 5 and again there were variations among species. Full leaf unfolded for  A. incana  lasted significantly (p",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The geographic applicability of most phenological models is limited because of a lack in accounting for plant genotypic variation over space. This limitation may be partly addressed by quantifying plant adaptation patterns as revealed by common garden/provenance trial research. This study delineated adaptive patterns of a widely distributed tree species in North America\u2014white ash ( Fraxinus americana ) using multi-year common garden observations of leaf out and leaf senescence phenology. Geographically varied phenology-climate (i.e., phenoclimatic) relationships of tree provenances were investigated both with the aid of interannual temperature variations and using process-based models. Interannual weather fluctuations likely led to varied gradients of spring phenological timing by tree origin latitude as influenced by interactions of chilling and forcing, while the latitudinal gradient of autumn phenology consistently followed a photoperiod-driven pattern. Fitted models revealed latitudinal gradients of chilling requirement (for dormancy release), forcing requirement (for bud break), and critical day length requirement (for leaf senescence) for the tree provenances. When these genotype-specific phenoclimatic relationships were accounted for in spring models, predictions closely matched the latitudinal gradient of USA-National Phenology Network (NPN) observations. On the other hand, average (non-spatial) model predictions of bud break tended to be biased in the species\u2019 northern and southern ranges. This finding shows that introducing genotypic differences to phenological models is necessary for accurate prediction of temperate tree phenology over broad geographic regions.",

        "abstract": "Mobile systems such as smartphones and tablets are re-adopting swapping -- a mature but by rarely used OS feature -- to extend memory capacity without adding more DRAM, especially low-end devices. This resurgence of swapping in mobile systems has inspired both traditional \"off-the-rack\" schemes and new approaches based on compression and new hardware. Their vastly different designs, however, make them difficult for system designers to measure, compare and revise. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework, SwapBench, to appraise swap schemes and focus on two important but overlooked metrics: application launch and switch. Cross-validation with microbenchmarks shows that SwapBench is accurate. Based on the findings from SwapBench, we further discuss the impacts of different approaches to swapping in mobile systems.",

        "abstract": "Mobile virtualization provides a secure and reliable mobile ecosystem in many aspects, such as personal privacy, corporate and public security. However, the limited memory resources of mobile systems and virtualization's memory demanding feature post challenges on main memory. Fortunately, non-volatile random access memory(NVRAM) provides opportunities to solve the problem with its attractive features, such as high density, low standby power and so on. However, the long write latency of NVRAM may slow down the performance of write-intensive tasks. Time-critical tasks may end up with unbearable performance. In this paper, we therefore focus on improving the performance of mobile virtualization with NVRAM/DRAM hybrid main memory. To achieve this, we propose NV-CFS, an user-centric virtual machine scheduler built for the ARM/KVM hypervisor. Experimental results based on various pseudo-randomly selected task sets show that NV-CFS can improve the performance more than 30%, and significantly reduce the task deadline miss ratio when compared to the traditional scheduling algorithm.",

In this paper, we utilize morphable resistive memories to design a high-performance mobile system with an extensible memory space. With morphable resistive memories, a simple and effective page management technique, Balloonfish, is proposed to convert the memory cell state between multilevel and single-level for achieving a balance between performance and memory space. First, an application-specific page allocation is proposed for managing morphable resistive memories in virtualized mobile systems. Besides, we use a balloon-style algorithm to balance memory allocation among multiple virtual machines. Our evaluation based on the Samsung Exynos 5250 system-on-chip with various real Android applications shows that our system achieves 28.63% performance improvement compared with the baseline scheme.",

        "abstract": "Checkpointing is a key enabler of hibernation, live migration and fault-tolerance for virtual machines (VMs) in mobile devices. However, checkpointing a VM is usually heavy-weight: the VMu0027s entire memory needs to be dumped to storage, which induces a significant amount of (slow) I/O operations, degrading system performance and user experience. In this paper, we propose FLIC, a fast and lightweight checkpointing machinery for virtualized mobile devices by taking advantages of recent byte-addressable, non-volatile memory (NVRAM). Instead of saving the VMu0027s entire memory to storage, we store its working set pages in NVRAM, avoiding accessing slow flash memory (compared to server-grade SSDs). To cope with the energy constraint of mobile systems, we further deduplicate VM snapshots, reducing the VMu0027s image size and saving storage space. Experimental results based on an Exynos 5250 SoC show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of checkpointing in mobile virutalization and save energy.",

To better understand the energy consumption of swapping, we build an energy model to analyze the energy consumption of different paging architectures. We evaluate DR.

This work ismotivated by the serious demands of a high-performance inmemoryfrequent-pattern mining strategy, with joint optimizationover the mining performance and system durability. While thewidely-used frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) serves as an efficientapproach for frequent-pattern mining, its construction procedureoften makes it unfriendly for nonvolatile memories (NVMs). Inparticular, the incremental construction of FP-tree could generatemany unnecessary writes to the NVM and greatly degrade theenergy efficiency, because NVM writes typically take more timeand energy than reads. To overcome the drawbacks of FP-treeon NVMs, this paper proposes evergreen FP-tree (EvFP-tree), which includes a lazy counter and a minimum-bit-altered (MBA) encoding scheme to make FP-tree friendly for NVMs. The basicidea of the lazy counter is to greatly eliminate the redundantwrites generated in FP-tree construction. On the other hand, theMBA encoding scheme is to complement existing wear-levelingtechniques to evenly write each memory cell to extend the NVMlifetime. As verified by experiments, EvFP-tree greatly enhancesthe mining performance and system lifetime by 28.01% and82.10% on average, respectively.",

A PCM cell can be dynamically programmed to be in either multiple-level cell(MLC) mode or single-level cell(SLC) mode. With this morphable feature, we can utilize the high-density of MLC and low-latency of SLC, to satisfy various memory requirements of specific applications in embedded systems. However, compared to its SLC counterpart, the lifetime of MLC is limited.To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple and effective wear-leveling technique, named Mixer, to enhance the lifetime of morphable PCM considering the program specific features. We first build an Integer Linear Programming(ILP) formulation to dynamically configure the optimal SLC/MLC partition in morphable PCM, and produce the best data allocation for each variable to achieve a balanced write distribution in morphable PCM with low memory access cost. The basic idea is to allocate low-latency SLC and high-density MLC cells for write intensive variables and other ordinary variables, respectively. We then propose a polynomial time algorithm to achieve near-optimal results. The evaluation results show that the proposed technique can effectively improve the lifetime of morphable PCM in embedded systems compared with previous work.",

However, most frequent-pattern mining algorithms are designed for DRAM, instead of the energy-economic nonvolatile memories (NVMs). Due to the huge differences between the characteristics of NVMs and those of DRAM, existing frequent-pattern mining algorithms suffer from serious overheads of write amplification or energy consumption as used on NVMs. The design complexity is exaggerated when parallel computing is used to speedup the mining process. This paper proposes PevFP-tree, a parallel frequent-pattern mining solution for NVMs, e.g., phase-change memory (PCM). By considering the NVM characteristics, PevFP-tree accelerates the mining process and enhance the energy efficiency. Moreover, PevFP-tree offers superior scalability in terms of the degree of parallelism of the mining algorithm and the branching factor of its tree structure. The efficacy of PevFP-tree is evaluated by experiments based on realistic datasets.",

This resurgence of swapping in mobile systems has inspired both traditional \u201coff-the-rack\u201d schemes and new approaches based on compression and new hardware. Their vastly different designs, however, make them difficult for system designers to measure, compare and revise. In this paper, we first propose an evaluation framework, SwapBench, to appraise swap schemes and focus on two important but overlooked metrics: application launch and switch. And cross-validation with microbenchmarks shows that SwapBench is accurate. Then, we present the first comprehensive evaluation from three dimensions: system architecture, application launch time and application switch delays, to understand and summarize the impacts of swapping in mobile systems. Finally, based on the findings from SwapBench, we give our conclusion and suggestions of different approaches to swapping in mobile systems.",

For example, finding the specific Apps becomes more inconvenient due to more Apps installed on smartphones, and App response time could become longer because of the gap between more, larger Apps and limited memory capacity. Recent work has proposed several methods of predicting next used Apps (here in after appprediction) to solve the issues, but faces the problems of the low prediction accuracy and high training costs. Especially, applying app-prediction to memory management (such as LMK) and App prelaunching has high requirements for the prediction accuracy and training costs. In this paper, we propose an app-prediction framework, named HiNextApp, to improve the app-prediction accuracy and reduce training costs in mobile systems. HiNextApp is based on contextual information, and can adjust the size of prediction periods adaptively. The framework mainly consists of two parts: non-uniform bayes model and an elastic algorithm. The experimental results show that HiNextApp can effectively improve the prediction accuracy and reduce training times. Besides, compared with traditional bayes model, the overhead of our framework is relatively low.",

        "abstract": "Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have essentially reached the state-of-the-art accuracies in image classification and recognition. CNNs are usually deployed in server side or cloud to handle tasks collected from mobile devices, such as smartphones, wearable devices, unmanned systems and so on. However, significant data transmission overhead and privacy issues have made it necessary to use CNNs directly in device side. Nevertheless, the statically trained model deployed on mobile devices cannot effectively handle the unknown data and objects in new environments, which could lead to low accuracy and unsatisfied user experience. Hence, it would be crucial to retrain a better model via future unknown data. However, with tremendous computing cost and memory usage, training a CNN on mobile devices with limited hardware resources is intolerable in practical. To solve this issue, by using the power of cloud is a promising solution to assist mobile devices to train a deep neural network. Therefore, this paper proposes a cloud-assisted lightweight CNN framework, named FitCNN, with incremental learning and low data transmission, to deploy CNNs on mobile devices and make them smarter. To reduce the data transmission during incremental learning, we propose a strategy to selectively upload the data with high learning value, and develop an extracting strategy to choose light weights of the new CNN model trained on the cloud to update the old one on devices. Experimental results show that the selectively uploading strategy can reduce 39.4% uploading transmission based on a certain dataset, and the extracting weights strategy reduces by more than 60% updating transmission with multiple CNNs and datasets.",

        "abstract": "It is a significant problem to efficiently identify the frequently occurring patterns in a given dataset, so as to unveil the trends hidden behind the dataset. This paper is motivated by the serious demands of a high-performance in-memory frequent-pattern mining strategy, with joint optimization over the mining performance and system durability. While the widely used frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) serves as an efficient approach for frequent-pattern mining, its construction procedure often makes it unfriendly for nonvolatile memories (NVMs). In particular, the incremental construction of FP-tree could generate many unnecessary writes to the NVM and greatly degrade the energy efficiency, because NVM writes typically take more time and energy than reads. To overcome the drawbacks of FP-tree on NVMs, this paper proposes evergreen FP-tree (EvFP-tree), which includes a  lazy counter  and a minimum-bit-altered (MBA)  encoding scheme  to make FP-tree friendly for NVMs. The basic idea of the lazy counter is to greatly eliminate the redundant writes generated in FP-tree construction. On the other hand, the MBA encoding scheme is to complement existing wear-leveling techniques to evenly write each memory cell to extend the NVM lifetime. As verified by experiments, EvFP-tree greatly enhances the mining performance and system lifetime by 40.28% and 87.20% on average, respectively. And EvFP-tree reduces the energy consumption by 50.30% on average.",

However, this success comes with the considerable computation and storage costs which make it difficult to deploy these networks directly on resource-constrained embedded systems. To address this problem, we propose TaiJiNet, a binary-network-based framework that combines binary convolutions and pointwise convolutions, to reduce the computation and storage overhead while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Furthermore, in order to provide TaiJiNet with more flexibility, we introduce a strategy called partial binarized convolution to efficiently balance network performance and accuracy. We evaluate TaiJiNet with the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The experimental results show that with the proposed TaiJiNet framework, the binary version of AlexNet can achieve 26x compression rate with a negligible 0.8% accuracy drop when compared with the full-precision AlexNet.",

        "abstract": "Solar powered sensor nodes have been adopted in many applications, but unstable energy source and high energy loss are hindrances to their wide spreading. Storage-less and converter-less solar powered non-volatile sensor nodes reduce the energy loss to a great extent. However, without energy buffers, sensor nodes become more sensitive to solar variations. Making full use of harvested energy to provide better quality of services (QoS) to guarantee stable operations under this circumstance is crucial. In this paper, we devise an energy efficient task mapping strategy for storage-less and converter-less solar powered non-volatile sensor nodes. The proposed strategy, Puppet uses a reinforcement learning to make nodes achieve higher energy utilization and finally enhance the QoS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy reduces the deadline miss ratio (DMR) in Puppet by 22% while increases energy utilization and effective energy utilization by 11% and 25%, on the average, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have essentially achieved the state-of-the-art accuracies in image classification and recognition tasks. CNNs are usually deployed in the cloud to handle data collected from IoT devices, such as smartphones and unmanned systems. However, significant data transmission overhead and privacy issues have made it necessary to use CNNs directly in device side. Nevertheless, the trained model deployed on mobile devices cannot effectively handle the unknown data and objects in new environments, which could lead to low accuracy and poor user experience. Hence, it would be crucial to re-train a better model via future unknown data. However, with tremendous computing cost and memory usage, training a CNN on IoT devices with limited hardware resources is intolerable in practice. To solve this issue, using the power of cloud to assist mobile devices to train a deep neural network becomes a promising solution .  Therefore, this paper proposes a cloud-assisted CNN framework, named FitCNN, with incremental learning and low data transmission, to reduce the overhead of updating CNNs deployed on devices. To reduce the data transmission during incremental learning, we propose a strategy, called Distiller, to selectively upload the data that is worth learning, and develop an extracting strategy, called Juicer, to choose light amount of weights from the new CNN model generated on the cloud to update the corresponding old ones on devices. Experimental results show that the Distiller strategy can reduce 39.4% data transmission of uploading based on a certain dataset, and the Juicer strategy reduces by more than 60% data transmission of updating with multiple CNNs and datasets.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, time-series data have emerged in a variety of application domains, such as wireless sensor networks and surveillance systems. To identify the similarity between time-series data, the Euclidean distance and its variations are common metrics that quantify the differences between time-series data. However, the Euclidean distance is limited by its inability to elastically shift with the time axis, which motivates the development of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithms. While DTW algorithms have been proven very useful in diversified applications like speech recognition, their efficacy might be seriously affected by the resolution of the time-series data. However, high-resolution time-series data might take up a gigantic amount of main memory and storage space, which will slow down the DTW analysis procedure. This makes the upscaling of DTW analysis more challenging, especially for in-memory data analytics platforms with limited nonvolatile memory space. In this paper, we propose a strategy to downsample time-series data to significantly reduce their size without seriously affecting the precision of the results obtained by DTW algorithms (downsizing without downgrading). In other words, this paper proposes a technique to remove the unimportant details that are largely ignored by DTW algorithms. The efficacy of the proposed technique is verified by a series of experimental studies, where the results are quite encouraging.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-dense networks (UDNs), which can provide extremely high throughput and data rates, have been considered as one of the key techniques for the fifth generation mobile networks. However, it may cause severe inter-cell interference and significant energy consumption due to numerous base stations (BSs) being randomly deployed. To mitigate the interference and boost energy efficiency (EE) of the UDN effectively, we propose a cluster-based energy-efficient resource allocation scheme in this paper. The proposed scheme has two stages: clustering stage and resource allocation stage. In clustering stage, we use a modified K-means algorithm in BS-clustering process to dynamically adjust the number of BS-clusters based on the density of BSs. Then, in each BS cluster, we divide user equipments (UEs) into multiple UE-groups with minimum intra-cluster interference. In this way, the complexity of resource allocation can be greatly reduced. While in resource allocation stage, we design a two-step resource blocks assignment algorithm and an iterative energy efficient power allocation algorithm based on a non-cooperative game. Furthermore, we implement simulations under the realistic broadband channel propagation conditions and the simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively mitigate the interference and improve the EE of UDN.",

        "abstract": "Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) applications transmit not only user-triggered messages (UTMs), but also keep-alive messages (KAMs) via radio access network, which induces heavy burden in control plane channel and wastes user equipment (UE) energy consumption. In this paper, we deduce the joint distribution of KAM period and UTM mean interval from the MIM application traffic characteristics. Correlating the joint distribution with radio resource control (RRC) state machine in LTE networks, we derive two analytical expressions for the control plane signaling load and UE energy consumption respectively. Then, the variation of signaling load and energy usage is demonstrated with different settings of RRC release timer, KAM period and UTM mean interval. The analysis indicates that KAM period is the upper bound of RRC release timer when reducing the signaling load. Besides, five times of UTM mean interval is the upper bound of KAM period when reducing the UE energy consumption and signaling load. These results can guide both network operators and MIM application developers to properly set control parameters for balancing the signaling load and UE energy consumption.",

This paper proposes Gini coefficient, which is a primary measure of the inequality of income in economics, can be developed to represent the system fairness in mobile networks.

        "abstract": "In future mobile networks, more and more machine-type communication (MTC) devices with different service requirements will be deployed. To meet the massive access needs of MTC, this paper develops a cluster-based congestion-mitigating access scheme (CCAS), with aim to mitigate the severe collision of MTC devices (MTCDs) that access to the base station (BS) concurrently. To this end, we first design a modified spectral clustering algorithm to group MTCDs into different clusters based on their locations and service requirements. Then, a device called MTC gateway (MTCG) is chosen by two steps to assist transmitting data for MTCDs in each cluster. In the data transmission process, MTCG is in charge of aggregating packets generated by MTCDs in a cluster and forwarding them to BS when the number of buffered packets reaches a certain threshold. To model the aggregation and forwarding process of each MTCG, we use queuing theory to analyze the access performance in terms of collision probability and access delay. In addition, we also implement simulations to further validate the accuracy of our analytical model and the effectiveness of CCAS. Numerical results, which are consistent with the theoretical values, show that the proposed CCAS can significantly decrease collision probability, and increase the number of successfully received packets of the system without increasing average access delay.",

Driven by the pursuit of green communication, this paper presents a space-reserved cooperative caching scheme for IIoT in the fifth generation mobile heterogeneous networks, where the cache space in a base station is divided into two parts, one is used to store the prefetched data from the servers ahead of the device request time and the other is reserved to store the temporarily buffering data in the wireless transmission queue at the device request time. With the constraint that the quality of service is guaranteed, we propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal proportion between the two parts of the cache space for the purpose of reducing the average energy consumption.

        "abstract": "The performance of wireless networks can be largely enhanced by coordinated multipoint (CoMP). To design an efficient CoMP in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output scenario, conventional transmission scheduling and power allocation are usually performed in a static and centralized manner. In this paper, we focus on dynamic and distributed transmission scheduling and power allocation. We first determine the coordinated base-station sets (defined as CBSs) candidates in each subband by the channel energy ( i.e., square Frobenius norm of channel matrix) of each user. Each CBS candidate contains a set of coordination base-stations and edge users. By chordal distance, we can measure the orthogonality between space spanned of users in the same CBS candidate. Then, we propose two heuristic user scheduling algorithms based on channel energy and chordal distance between users to determine the set of users served by each CBS candidate. The first algorithm is based on an open problem, which reveals the philosophy of user scheduling with orthogonalization threshold guarantee. The second one deals with user scheduling by selecting a set of edge users with the largest total channel energy and orthogonalization threshold guarantee. With the total channel energy per CBS candidate, the CBSs and their served edge users can be determined. Then, water-filling power allocation is further applied to CBSs with block diagonalization precoding. Algorithm performance is demonstrated by extensive simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this study, porous carbon aerogel (CA) was synthesized with D-glucose, ammonium persulfate and aniline by a hydrothermal carbonization method. It was reported for the first time as an excellent catalyst for activating persulfate (PS) to degrade rhodamine B (RhB). The morphology of CA was characterized, exhibiting microporous and mesoporous structures. The solution pH of 3, 5, 7 and 9 showed slight impact on the degradation of RhB; however, when the pH increased to 11, the removal of RhB decreased. The PS concentration and CA dosage played a key role in the RhB degradation, and the activation energy was calculated to be 22.11\u202fkJ/mol. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra suggested that neither sulfate radical (SO4) nor hydroxyl radical (OH) was generated from the PS activation. The radical quenching experiments also confirmed that CA activated PS in a non-radical pathway. It was indicated that PS bonded with CC in the sp hybridized system could directly degrade RhB. The defective edges at the boundary of CA also facilitated the RhB removal. This work presented a green material with both excellent catalytic performance and high regeneration possibility in the heterogeneous metal-free PS activation, providing a new strategy in water treatment.",

The modified cathode had a high H 2 O 2  production with low energy consumption, which was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption study and contact angle. The flow-through E-Fenton system was compared to the flow-by and regular one, and confirmed to be best on MB removal and TOC degradation. The operational parameters such as current density, pH, Fe 2+  concentration and flow rate were optimized. The MB and TOC removal efficiency of the effluents could keep above 90% and 50%, respectively, and the energy consumption was 23.0\u00a0kWh/kgTOC at the current density of 50\u00a0mA, pH 3, 0.3\u00a0mM Fe 2+ , and the flow rate of 7\u00a0mL/min.  OH was proved to be the main oxidizing species in this system. After 5 times operation, the system, especially cathode, still showed good stability. Five more organic pollutants including orange II (OG), tartrazine, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), tetracycline (TC) and 2,4-dichlorophen (2,4-DCP) were investigated and the electric energy consumption (EEC) was compared with literatures. All results demonstrated that this flow-through E-Fenton system was energy-efficient and potential for degradation of organic pollutants.",

The rolling-made GDE showed a good activity and stability for H 2 O 2  production, with a H 2 O 2  concentration of 595\u00a0mg/L at 120\u00a0min and variation within 3.36% even after 10 times reuses. The effect of five metals and their loading contents on MO degradation were investigated, and the Co/GDE showed the highest activity when the loading content of Co was 0.7\u00a0wt%. Particularly this activity showed good stability toward pH variation (3\u20139), demonstrating promising advantage of this heterogeneous EF-like for application. Further it was proved that hydroxyl radical played an important role on pollutants degradation, and a possible degradation scheme for heterogeneous EF-like on Co/GDE was proposed based on the results and characterizations such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).",

        "abstract": "The development of an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathode for hydrogen peroxide production represents an important challenge in the field of electrochemical processes and is highly demanded for chemical industries and environmental remediation applications. In this work, a novel graphite felt cathode modified with electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEGr) and carbon black was developed, and it presented a very high H2O2 generation rate of 7.7 mg h\u22121 cm\u22122 with a relatively low energy consumption (9.7 kW h kg\u22121). Characterized by SEM, TEM, AFM, Raman, XRD, and XPS, the synthesized EEGr was proven to be a 3\u20134 layers thin sheet with low defects. Important cathode manufacture parameters, including the ratio and loading of EEGr, were optimized, and the dependence of H2O2 generation with the pH and cathode potential as well as the performance stability were investigated. At an optimized cathode potential of \u22120.9 V and pH 7, the modified cathode kept a stable performance for H2O2 generation during 10 cycles, which was 2 times that of the cathode without EEGr. Further explored by CV, rotating disk electrode (RDE), and contact angles analysis, the presence of EEGr was found to accelerate the electron transfer rate and benefit the oxygen surface reaction, but not change the two-electrons ORR number, which contributed to the enhanced performance for H2O2 production, and a possible mechanism is suggested. Finally, such a graphene-modified cathode demonstrated effectiveness for the degradation of four kinds of representative pollutants (orange II, methylene blue, phenol, and sulfadiazine) by an electro-Fenton process, proving it has great potential practical application for organic wastewater treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Developing highly efficient carbon based catalyst for electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) application is significant for environmental remediation. Herein, for the first time, the in-situ metal-free EAOPs with graphite felt cathode modified by N-doped graphene (N-EEGr) was established and demonstrated a superior and reusable catalytic activity for activation of H 2 O 2  to    OH. N-EEGr-GF was systematically characterized, and its electrocatalytic behavior for oxygen reduction reaction as well as the degradation performance were investigated. N-doping was found not changing the electrochemical generation of H 2 O 2 , but increasing the catalytic decomposition with a doubled phenol degradation rate. ESR spectra, methanol and benzoquinone capture confirmed the existence of    OH and    O 2  in EAOPs, while the former played the dominant role. Compared with traditional electro-Fenton (EF), this in-situ metal-free EAOPs demonstrated 4-times higher efficiencies with a more broad suitability upon pH. In view of its competitive advantage in reusability and environmental friendliness without catalysts addition and second pollution, this process can be regarded as the competent substitution of traditional EF for wastewater treatment. This study illustrated insights into the versatile N-EEGr for sustainable activation of H 2 O 2  to    OH and may shed light on the development of remarkable catalyst for highly efficient metal-free EAOPs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To increase the performance of MFCs, nitrogen-doped activated carbon (AC) for rolling-pressed air-cathode was synthesized using inexpensive melamine as nitrogen source by pyrolysis. The ratio of melamine to activated carbon (N/C) and pyrolysis temperature were optimized to be 10 and 900\u202f\u00b0C. To clarify how the structure and active nitrogen content in different preparations influence the ORR performance, series of characterizations were carried out, and a good agreement between the content of pyridinic type N and high ORR activity was observed. As a dominant four electron cathode catalyst, AC-N10-900 exhibited the best performance both in electrochemical and MFCs tests in comparison with AC and Pt/C. The maximum power density was 1042\u202fmW\u202fm \u22122 , which was 65.4% and 116.2% higher than that of AC and Pt/C. Therefore, AC-N10-900, one of cost-effective and metal-free MFCs cathode catalysts towards ORR, is expected to alternate precious metal for high performance in MFCs.",

Herein, a template-free hydrothermal synthesis of monolithic nitrogen-doped carbon cryogels was developed, where glucose was used as the carbon precursor and polyaniline (PANI) as nitrogen source and a novel crosslinking agent. The monolithic hydrogels can be formed in only 2\u202fh\u202fat a low hydrothermal temperature (140\u202f\u00b0C), the shortest time and the lowest temperature for the hydrothermal synthesis of monolithic hydrogels up to now.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A highly energy-efficient peroxi-coagulation (PC) process was developed based on modified graphite felt, and the acrylonitrile removal efficiency was also comparatively studied by electro-Fenton (EF) and electrocoagulation (EC). The results showed that acrylonitrile was slowly and ineffectively removed by EC and EF, whereas by PC it was not only more rapid, but also effective at wide pH ranges of 3.0\u20139.0, which overcame the pH limitations for EC and EF. In addition, the electric energy consumption (EEC) of EF, EC and PC was 36.01, 14.43 and 3.08\u202fkWh/kg respectively, suggesting PC was more economical. The influence of important operating factors such as pH, applied current and initial concentration were investigated for these three processes. The production of    OH and transformation of iron ions were analyzed to explore the mechanisms of PC process. Compared to conventional treatment methods, PC was more cost-effective due to the combined action of    OH as well as the coagulation with the formed Fe(OH) 3  precipitate. Primary intermediates were identified by GC\u2013MS analysis, and a possible pathway was proposed by the action of    OH in EF and the hydrogenation in EC. This work demonstrated that PC is cost-effective and has potential for the degradation of acrylonitrile.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   N-doped carbon aerogel (CA) was prepared by one-pot template-free synthesis and chemically activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH). KOH activation highlighted the structural superiority with increased BET surface area and hierarchically porous structure (especially micropores), and also significantly influenced active nitrogen species and oxygen functional groups (C O C and COOH) content. With KOH increasing, pyridinic N content increased, while pyrrolic N content decreased. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity showed a positive linear correlation with pyridinic N content but decreased with pyrrolic N content increasing. C O C and COOH content increased after activation, and then decreased with KOH increasing. The reduced C O C and COOH content of CA-KOH guaranteed a lower H 2 O 2  yield for higher microbial fuel cell (MFC) efficiency. CA-10KOH (mass ratio of KOH to CA was 10) exhibited outstanding performance with the highest maximum power density (967\u202f\u00b1\u202f34\u202fmW\u202fm \u22122 ), which was 37.4%, 55.2% and 283.7% higher than platinum (Pt/C), activated carbon (BET surface area of 2276\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121 ) and CA. The outstanding performance of CA-10KOH was attributed to the conjunct effect of superior BET surface area (1827\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121 ), increased micropores, the highest pyridinic N (0.26\u202fat.%), the lowest pyrrolic N content and reduced C O C and COOH content. Overall, KOH activated CA is a promising metal-free cathode catalyst for high performance in MFCs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   It is attractive to develop multifunctional materials for practical applications. Herein, heteroatom-doped hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) are prepared through a simple pyrolysis of monolithic hydrogels derived from glucose, followed by chemical activation using KOH as an activator at 600\u20131000\u202f\u00b0C. With different activation temperature, the pore structure and surface chemistry of the resulting HPCs can be easily tuned and the corresponding performances in supercapacitors, CO 2  capture and dye adsorption are further investigated. HPC800 with the largest micropore volume (0.58\u202fcm 3 \u202fg \u22121 ) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 249\u202fF\u202fg \u22121 \u202fat 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121  and an excellent cycling stability with 94% of the capacitance retention after 1000 cycles as supercapacitors electrodes. Meanwhile, HPC800 shows the remarkable adsorption capacity of CO 2  (4.4\u202fmmol\u202fg \u22121 \u202fat 25\u202f\u00b0C, 1\u202fatm). For methylene blue (MB) adsorption, the maximum adsorption capacity of 720\u202fmg\u202fg \u22121  is obtained on HPC1000 with the highest specific surface area (2302\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121 ) and total pore volume (1.10\u202fcm 3 \u202fg \u22121 ). The CO 2  and MB adsorption capacities are both higher than most of the reported adsorbents. It is demonstrated that CO 2  and MB adsorption capacity are determined by the volume of pore with diameter",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nanocarbons are promising alternatives to metal-based catalysts in advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment. Herein, carbon cryogels were prepared through the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of glucose directed by polyaniline (PANI) and their catalytic performances towards persulfate (PS) activation for the degradation of organic pollutants were investigated. When the polymerization temperature of PANI was increased from 0 to 80\u202f\u00b0C, carbon cryogels exhibited increased total pore volume (0.23\u20130.33\u202fcm 3 \u202fg \u22121 ) and decreased average particle diameter (132\u201363\u202fnm), which further enhanced their adsorption and catalytic activity for PS activation. The excellent catalytic activity of carbon cryogels for PS activation was universal in the degradation of different organic pollutants, comparable to various metal catalysts and reported metal-free catalyst, applied to a wide pH range (pH 3\u20139), and easily regenerated through calcination, proving that it had potential practical application for organic wastewater treatment. Radical quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments demonstrated the nonradical pathway in catalytic oxidation of orange acid 7 (AO7) on carbon cryogels. It was found that the reaction rate of catalytic oxidation of AO7 was positively correlated with the meso-/macropore volume and negatively with particle diameter of carbon cryogels. Finally, the catalytic process for organic pollutants on carbon cryogels was suggested.",

It proved the coupling process achieved a higher removal efficiency (5\u201344%) than single flow-through EF system and kept stable performance in 600\u202fmin treatment, contributed to the dynamic regeneration of ACF by utilizing the remaining oxidants from EF. Some important parameters such as current, initial pH, flow rate and initial TC concentration were optimized. For the TC of initial concentration of 50\u202fmg/L, the TC removal efficiency reached above 90% with a low energy consumption of 48.6\u202fkWh/(kgTOC) at the current of 80\u202fmA and flow rate of 7\u202fmL/min. This coupling process was not only more cost-effective than single flow-through EF, but also advantaged over wider adaption of pH range till 7, providing a more promising approach for organic pollutants removal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology relies on electroactive bacteria to degrade organic molecules for bioelectricity production. MFC is a potentially useful approach for wastewater treatment with concomitant energy production. The main advantages of MFC for treating wastewater include energy saving, sludge volume reduction and bioenergy generation. In the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in improving MFC performances. However, MFCs still face significant hurdles for practical deployments due to their low power densities and high costs. Further improvements are becoming harder to achieve for standalone MFC devices. In recent years, MFCs have been integrated with physical, chemical and biological processes for wastewater treatment, bioelectricity production, chemical production and desalination. The hybrid systems are more promising compared with standalone MFCs. This comprehensive and state-of-the-art review discusses different systems coupled with MFCs using different working principles, reactor designs, operating parameters and their effects on system performances. These systems include bioelectro-Fenton-MFC, microbial desalination cell, MFC-electrosorption cell, microbial solar cell, microbial reverse-electrodialysis cell, plant-MFC and constructed wetland-MFC. Synergistic effects and mechanisms of process coupling as well as the challenges for practical applications of each hybrid system are assessed. Although MFC-hybrid systems are more promising than standalone MFCs, much more research is needed to overcome significant hurdles for practical deployment.",

        "abstract": "Although certain biomarkers that are directly associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) have been identified, the efficacy of a single factor is limited to predicting the prognosis. The aim of the present study was to identify a combination micro (mi)RNA signature that enhanced the prognostic prediction for PAAD. Following analysis of the data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 175 PAAD samples were selected for the present study, and the associations between 494 miRNAs and OS were investigated. The prognostic value of all miRNAs was analyzed by multivariate Cox regression, and the miRNAs were ranked according to the hazard ratio (HR) and P\u2011values. The top 5 miRNAs (miR\u20111301, miR\u2011125a, miR\u2011376c, miR\u2011328 and miR\u2011376b) were significantly associated with OS (HR=0.139; 95% confidence interval, 0.043\u20110.443; P<0.001), thus demonstrating that this panel was able to serve as an independent prognostic factor for PAAD. In addition, the present study also predicted the target genes of the top 10 miRNAs with the highest prognostic values using 12 different prediction software, and enrichment signaling pathway analyses elucidated that several pathways may be markedly associated with these miRNAs, including 'Pathways in cancer', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Glioma' and 'MicroRNAs in cancer'. Lastly, ubiquitin C, epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor 1, mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase 1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog\u00a04 and androgen receptor may be the hub genes revealed by STRING analysis. The present study identified several miRNAs, particularly a five\u2011miRNA\u2011pool, that may be reliable, independent factors for predicting survival in patients with PAAD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms require further investigation in the future.",

        "abstract": "Scholars are striving to apply molecular biology involving long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in the prognostication of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). However, the clinical role of lncRNAs in the prognostic setting of PTC is still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive inquiry was performed to screen lncRNA expression profiling with 507 PTC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-sequencing datasets. A total of 734 lncRNAs were detected to be aberrantly expressed, among which three novel lncRNAs including AC079630.2, CRNDE and CTD-2171N6.1 were markedly related to the progression and survival of PTC. Furthermore, the aberrant expression of these lncRNAs could be verified by other cohorts from gene expression omnibus (GEO) as detected by microarrays. Next, we established a three-lncRNA signature and divided the PTC patients into two subgroups of high- and low-risk. Interestingly, patients with high-risk tended to gain obviously poorer outcome. Most importantly, this three-lncRNA signature was an independent biomarker to predict the patient survival of PTC. The accurate molecular roles of these three lncRNAs remains unclarified and warrants further characterization, but our current data propose that they might play pivotal roles in PTC tumorigenesis and more importantly, these novel lncRNAs are closely related to patients' survival. These discoveries will have far-reaching consequences with respect to molecular prediction of PTC.",

        "abstract": "Lymph node metastasis commonly occurs in gastric cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of lymphatic microvessel density (LVD) is correlated with various malignancies. To evaluate the potential role of LVD in various malignancies, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to thoroughly investigate the association of LVD expression with tumor progression and survival in gastric cancer. We performed a comprehensive search of common databases and selected studies demonstrating the relationship between LVD expression and gastric cancer prognosis. Hazard ratios (HR) were used to determine the value of LVD for predicting gastric cancer metastasis and prognosis. The data were extracted from the included studies and pooled with the appropriate effects model using STATA 12.0. The results showed that high LVD expression obviously impacted the prognosis of gastric cancer, based on an overall survival (OS) HR of 2.58 (95% CI: 1.91-3.48,  < 0.001) and a disease-free survival (DFS) HR of 2.51 (95% CI: 1.35-4.68,  = 0.004) in the univariate analysis. In addition, the results of the multivariate analysis indicated a remarkable relationship between high LVD expression and gastric neoplasm prognosis. The pooled OS HR was 4.12 (95% CI: 3.45-4.91,  < 0.001). The current meta-analysis shows that high LVD is closely related to tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in gastric malignancy. LVD could be a key factor in tumor lymphatic metastasis. Moreover, LVD is likely a potential index and an effective biomarker for the prediction of patient prognosis.",

However, the molecular mechanism of miR-449a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly elucidated and is disputed. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to systematically review the current literature and to utilize the public Gene Expression Omnibus database to determine the role of miR-449a and its significance in HCC. A total of eight original papers and seven microarrays were included in the present study. Based on the evidence, miR-449a was reduced in HCC. miR-449a is likely involved in various signaling pathways and is targeted to multiple mRNA as part of its function in HCC. In addition, a preliminary bioinformatic analysis was conducted for miR-449a to investigate the novel potential pathways that miR-449a may participate in regarding HCC.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to explore the potential clinical significance of microRNA (miR)-124-3p expression in the hepatocarcinogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as the potential target genes of functional HCC pathways. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the expression of miR-124-3p in 101 HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. Additionally, the association between miR-124-3p expression and clinical parameters was also analyzed. Differentially expressed genes identified following miR-124-3p transfection, the prospective target genes predicted  and the key genes of HCC obtained from Natural Language Processing (NLP) were integrated to obtain potential target genes of miR-124-3p in HCC. Relevant signaling pathways were assessed with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Protein Annotation Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) pathway enrichment analysis. miR-124-3p expression was significantly reduced in HCC tissues compared with expression in adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues. In HCC, miR-124-3p was demonstrated to be associated with clinical stage. The mean survival time of the low miR-124-3p expression group was reduced compared with that of the high expression group. A total of 132 genes overlapped from differentially expressed genes, miR-124-3p predicted target genes and NLP identified genes. PPI network construction revealed a total of 109 nodes and 386 edges, and 20 key genes were identified. The major enriched terms of three GO categories included regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of cellular biosynthetic processes, cell leading edge, cytosol and cell projection, protein kinase activity, transcription activator activity and enzyme binding. KEGG analysis revealed pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer as the top three terms. Angiogenesis, the endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway and the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway were identified as the most significant terms in the PANTHER pathway analysis. The present study confirmed that miR-124-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC. miR-124-3p may target multiple genes, exerting its effect spatiotemporally, or in combination with a diverse range of processes in HCC. Functional characterization of miR-124-3p targets will offer novel insight into the molecular changes that occur in HCC progression.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression profile signature for survival assessment in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are largely inconsistent due to distinct detecting approaches and small sample size. Systematic and integrative investigation of RNA-Seq based data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) herein was performed to determine candidate lncRNAs for prognosis evaluation of LUSC. A total of 60483 genes, including 7589 lncRNAs were assessed in a cohort including 478 LUSC cases with follow-up data. Firstly, 4225 differentially expressed lncRNAs were obtained via R packages. Next, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that 41 lncRNAs were closely related to the survival of LUSC. Finally, lncRNA based prognosis index (PI) could predict overall survival of LUSC with high accuracy (AUC = 0.652, CI: 0.598, 0.705), PI = exp*\u03b2+exp*\u03b2+exp*\u03b2+exp*\u03b2+exp*\u03b2. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the five-lncRNA signature could act as an independent prognostic indicator for LUSC (HR = 2.068,  < 0.001 with univariate analysis, HR = 1.928,  = 0.038 with multivariate). Besides, we constructed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of key lncRNA RP11-54H7.4 according to the -value of related genes' weight. This study provides a RNA-Seq based prognostic signature with five lncRNAs for further clinical application to LUSC patients.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can serve as prospective markers for survival in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, most studies have explored a limited number of lncRNAs in a small number of cases. The objective of this study is to identify a panel of lncRNA signature that could evaluate the prognosis in colorectal adenocarcinoma based on the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Altogether, 371 colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients with complete clinical data were included in our study as the test cohort. A total of 578 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were observed, among which 20 lncRNAs closely related to overall survival (OS) in COAD patients were identified using a Cox proportional regression model. A risk score formula was developed to assess the prognostic value of the lncRNA signature in COAD with four lncRNAs (LINC01555, RP11-610P16.1, RP11-108K3.1 and LINC01207), which were identified to possess the most remarkable correlation with OS in COAD patients. COAD patients with a high-risk score had poorer OS than those with a low-risk score. The multivariate Cox regression analyses confirmed that the four-lncRNA signature could function as an independent prognostic indicator for COAD patients, which was largely mirrored in the validating cohort with rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) containing 158 cases. In addition, the correlative genes of LINC01555 and LINC01207 were enriched in the cAMP signaling and mucin type O-Glycan biosynthesis pathways. With further validation in the future, our study indicates that the four-lncRNA signature could serve as an independent biomarker for survival of colorectal adenocarcinoma.",

        "abstract": "FK506 binding protein 10 (FKBP10) has been reported to be dysregulated in numerous types of cancer; however, few reports have investigated FKBP10 in gastric cancer (GC). The aim of the present study was to investigate FKBP10 expression in GC and to analyze its association with the prognosis of patients with GC. FKBP10 mRNA expression was evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The standardized mean differences of the meta\u2011analysis were comprehensively evaluated for FKBP10 expression from a series of GEO datasets. Kaplan\u2011Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were applied to predict the prognostic value of FKBP10 in patients with GC. Additionally, the protein expression levels of FKBP10 were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 40\u00a0GC and adjacent tissues. FKBP10 co\u2011expression network and bioinformatics analyses were then used to explore the potential functional mechanisms of FKBP10. The results revealed that the mRNA expression levels of FKBP10 were significantly increased in GC within the TCGA and GEO databases. Survival analysis revealed that high FKBP10 expression results in poorer overall survival and disease\u2011free survival (P<0.05). Multivariate cox regression analysis indicate FKBP10 as a dependent prognostic factor. The results of IHC indicated that the protein expression levels of FKBP10 were higher in GC tissues than in adjacent non\u2011GC tissues (P<0.001). Co\u2011expression networks and functional enrichment analysis suggested that FKBP10 may be involved in the development of GC via cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix\u2011receptor interaction pathways. Therefore, the findings of the present study indicated that FKBP10 is upregulated in GC tissues, and suggests its potential prognostic value. Therefore FKBP10 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GC.",

The present study aimed to validate the diagnostic ability of miR\u2011338\u20115p and further explore the underlying molecular mechanism. Data from eligible studies, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) chips and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were gathered in the data mining and the integrated meta\u2011analysis, to evaluate the significance of miR\u2011338\u20115p in diagnosing HCC comprehensively. The potential target genes of miR\u2011338\u20115p were achieved from the intersection of the deregulated targets of miR\u2011338\u20115p from GEO and TCGA in addition to the predicted target genes from 12 online software. A protein\u2011protein\u2011interaction (PPI) network was drawn to illustrate the interaction between target genes and to define the hub genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the function of the target genes. From the results, miR\u2011338\u20115p exhibited favorable value in diagnosing HCC. Types of sample and experiment were defined as the possible sources of heterogeneity in meta\u2011analysis. A total of 423 genes were selected as the potential target genes of miR\u2011338\u20115p, and five genes were defined as the hub genes from the PPI network. The GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the target genes were significantly assembled in the pathways of metabolic process and cell cycle. miR\u2011338\u20115p may function as a novel diagnostic target for HCC through regulating certain target genes and signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) accounts for a significant proportion of lung cancer and there have been few therapeutic alternatives for recurrent LUSC due to the lack of specific driver molecules. To investigate the prospective role of lncRNAs in the tumorigenesis and progression of LUSC, the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were calculated based on The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-seq data. Of 7589 lncRNAs with 504 LUSC cases, 884 lncRNAs were identified as being aberrantly expressed (|log2 fold change| >2 and adjusted P<0.05) by DESeq R. The top 10 lncRNAs with the highest diagnostic value were SFTA1P,LINC00968, LINC00961, LINC01572,RP1-78O14.1, FENDRR, LINC01314,LINC01272, GATA6-AS1, and MIR3945HG. In addition to the significant roles in the carcinogenesis of LUSC, several lncRNAs also played vital parts in the survival and progression of LUSC. SFTA1P, LINC01272, GATA6-AS1 and MIR3945HG were closely related to the survival time of LUSC. Furthermore, LINC01572 and LINC01314 could distinguish the LUSC at early stage from that at advanced stage. The prospective molecular assessment of key lncRNAs showed that a certain series of genes could be involved in the regulation network. Furthermore, the OncoPrint from cBioPortal indicated that 14% (69/501) LUSC cases with genetic alterations could be obtained, including amplification, deep deletion and mRNA upregulation. More interestingly, the cases with genetic alterations had a poorer survival as compared to those without alterations. Overall, the study propounds a potentiality for interpreting the pathogenesis and development of LUSC with lncRNAs, and provides a novel platform for searching for more capable diagnostic biomarkers for LUSC.",

At the end of the 1-year follow-up, the frequency of ocular relapses decreased to 1.59 \u00b1 1.68 per year (ranging 0-6) (p < 0.001), as compared to 5.09 \u00b1 2.51 per year (ranging 3-15). Moreover, the frequency of oral ulcer relapses also decreased to 2.49 \u00b1 1.84 per year (ranging 0-6) (p < 0.001), as compared to 8.20 \u00b1 3.72 per year (ranging 2-10). Visual improvement or stability was observed in 32 patients (59%) in these 54 patients. During a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 3-33), the mean final VA (logMAR) had progressed from 1.0 logMAR to 0.8 logMAR in all treated patients.Long-term low dose of IFN\u03b1-2a is useful in treating Chinese BU patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs), key mediators of stress signals, are also potent wound healing inhibitors. To understand how stress signals inhibit wound healing, we investigated the role of membranous glucocorticoid receptor (mbGR) by using cell-impermeable BSA-conjugated dexamethasone. We found that mbGR inhibits keratinocyte migration and wound closure by activating a Wnt-like phospholipase (PLC)/ protein kinase C (PKC) signaling cascade. Rapid activation of mbGR/PLC/PKC further leads to activation of known biomarkers of nonhealing found in patients, \u03b2-catenin and c-myc. Conversely, a selective inhibitor of PKC, calphostin C, blocks mbGR/PKC pathway, and rescues GC-mediated inhibition of keratinocyte migration in\u00a0vitro and accelerates wound epithelialization of human wounds ex\u00a0vivo. This novel signaling mechanism may have a major impact on understanding how stress response via GC signaling regulates homeostasis and its role in development and treatments of skin diseases, including wound healing. To test tissue specificity of this nongenomic signaling mechanism, we tested retinal and bronchial human epithelial cells and fibroblasts. We found that mbGR/PLC/PKC signaling cascade exists in all cell types tested, suggesting a more general role. The discovery of this nongenomic signaling pathway, in which glucocorticoids activate Wnt pathway via mbGR, provides new insights into how stress-mediated signals may activate growth signals in various epithelial and mesenchymal tissues.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a major complication of diabetes, and there is a critical need to develop novel cell- and tissue-based therapies to treat these chronic wounds. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a replenishing source of allogeneic and autologous cell types that may be beneficial to improve DFU wound-healing outcomes. However, the biologic potential of iPSC-derived cells to treat DFUs has not, to our knowledge, been investigated. Toward that goal, we have performed detailed characterization of iPSC-derived fibroblasts from both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Significantly, gene array and functional analyses reveal that iPSC-derived fibroblasts from both patients with and those without diabetes are more similar to each other than were the primary cells from which they were derived. iPSC-derived fibroblasts showed improved migratory properties in 2-dimensional culture. iPSC-derived fibroblasts from DFUs displayed a unique biochemical composition and morphology when grown as 3-dimensional (3D), self-assembled extracellular matrix tissues, which were distinct from tissues fabricated using the parental DFU fibroblasts from which they were reprogrammed. In vivo transplantation of 3D tissues with iPSC-derived fibroblasts showed they persisted in the wound and facilitated diabetic wound closure compared with primary DFU fibroblasts. Taken together, our findings support the potential application of these iPSC-derived fibroblasts and 3D tissues to improve wound healing.-Kashpur, O., Smith, A., Gerami-Naini, B., Maione, A.

        "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex process regulated by various cell types and a plethora of mediators. While interactions between wounded skin and the hair follicles (HFs) could induce HF neogenesis or promote wound healing, it remains unknown whether the wound healing-associated signaling milieu can be manipulated to protect against alopecia, such as chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA). Utilizing a well-established neonatal rat model of CIA, we show here that skin wounding protects from alopecia caused by several clinically relevant chemotherapeutic regimens, and that protection is dependent on the time of wounding and hair cycle stage. Gene expression profiling unveiled a significant increase in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) mediated signaling by skin wounding. Subsequently, we showed that IL-1\u03b2 is sufficient and indispensable for mediating the CIA-protective effect. Administration of IL-1\u03b2 alone to unwounded rats exhibited local CIA protection while IL-1\u03b2 neutralization abrogated CIA protection by wounding. Mechanistically, IL-1\u03b2 retarded postnatal HF morphogenesis, making HFs at the wound sites or IL-1\u03b2 treated areas damage-resistant while the rats developed total alopecia elsewhere. We conclude that wound healing switches the cutaneous cytokine milieu to an IL-1\u03b2-dominated state thus retarding HF growth progression and rendering the HFs resistant to chemotherapy agents. In the future, manipulation of HF progression through interfering with the IL-1\u03b2 signaling milieu may provide therapeutic benefits to a variety of conditions, from prevention of CIA to inhibition of hair growth and treatment of hirsutism.",

        "title": "Integrative Analysis of miRNA and mRNA Paired Expression Profiling of Primary Fibroblast Derived from Diabetic Foot Ulcers Reveals Multiple Impaired Cellular Functions.",
        "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the major complications of diabetes. Its molecular pathology remains poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatments. Although it has been established that multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells, all contribute to inhibition of healing, less is known regarding contributions of individual cell type. Thus, we generated primary fibroblasts from non-healing DFUs and evaluated their cellular and molecular properties in comparison to non-diabetic foot fibroblasts (NFFs). Specifically, we analyzed both micro-RNA and mRNA expression profiles of primary DFU fibroblasts. Paired genomic analyses identified a total of 331 reciprocal miRNA-mRNA pairs including 21 miRNAs (FC>2.0) along with 239 predicted target genes (FC>1.5) that are significantly and differentially expressed. Of these, we focused on three miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-145-5p) that were induced in DFU fibroblasts as most differentially regulated. The involvement of these microRNAs in wound healing was investigated by testing the expression of their downstream targets as well as by quantifying cellular behaviors in prospectively collected and generated cell lines from 15 patients (7 DFUF and 8 NFF samples). We found large number of downstream targets of miR-21-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-145-5p to be coordinately regulated in mRNA profiles, which was confirmed by qPCR. Pathway analysis on paired miRNA-mRNA profiles predicted inhibition of cell movement and cell proliferation, as well as activation of cell differentiation and senescence in DFU fibroblasts, which was confirmed by cellular assays. We concluded that induction of miR-21-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-145-5p in DFU dermal fibroblasts plays an important role in impairing multiple cellular functions, thus contributing to overall inhibition of healing in DFUs.

        "abstract": "Extreme natural events have caused severe power system blackouts in recent years. It is important for power systems to survive after such events and recover the power supply, especially for critical loads (CLs), as soon as possible. In this paper, a control strategy is proposed for electric springs (ESs) to enhance resilience of microgrids with fluctuating renewable resources. First, the feasible operating region of the ES and the power\u2013voltage curve of the bus connected with the ES are derived analytically. Second, according to the derived feasible operating region, a novel control strategy of ES is proposed to regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrids with and without a communication system. The voltages on CLs are considered as a critical constraint for enhancing resilience during extreme natural events. Finally, the method to enhance resilience of microgrids with ES under both the frequency support mode and the voltage support mode are studied. Case studies demonstrate that ESs can enhance the resilience of microgrids with the proposed strategy with and without a communication system after extreme natural events.",

        "abstract": "An electric spring (ES) is effective in enhancing the operational flexibility and facilitating renewable energy integration. An ES can determine the operation status of the connected noncritical loads (NCLs) by adjusting its output voltage. It is possible to use NCLs as operation resources for renewable integration. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC)-based strategy is proposed to dispatch ESs with a water heating system (WHS) used as an NCL in an islanded microgrid to accommodate fluctuating renewables. Critical loads (CLs) in the microgrid can also benefit from ESs by obtaining a reliable supply voltage with smaller deviations than other loads. The CL is modeled using a ZIP static load model, which is commonly used to represent loads of a power system. The temperature constraint of the WHS and the ramping constraint of a diesel generator are considered and can be effectively managed by the proposed MPC strategy. Finally, the capabilities of NCLs with ESs to enhance operational flexibility are studied through sensitivity analyses with different ramping abilities of the microgrid.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the frequency regulation for a microgrid under islanded mode with variable renewables. Due to the structure and parameters of microgrids, the frequency of the system and the voltages on the buses are coupled. Furthermore, to smooth out the fast fluctuations of renewables, the controllability of components are quantified accurately. In this study, some critical and realistic considerations are identified and modelled, and the guidelines for battery energy storage system (BESS) sizing are thus obtained. First, the frequency and voltage regulation loops are coordinated by a non-linear model predictive control (MPC) controller, and the controllable resources are sequentially dispatched. Second, the dynamic model for evaluating the state of charge (SOC) of BESS under a fast response is introduced. Finally, general guidelines of the required energy capacity of BESS and the length of MPC control horizons are quantified by deriving the process of the responding disturbances. Ramping rates and response time delays of controllable resources are involved in the mathematical analysis. The simulation results show that the effectiveness of the proposed MPC controller and design guidelines can be generalised for microgrids in islanded mode with two kinds of controllable operating resources, which are represented by diesel generators and BESS.",

Then the individual channel analysis and design approach is employed to decompose such closed-loop multivariable system into components such as local subsystem and loop interactions. Subsequently, frequency-response behavior analyses of these components are individually conducted at various operating points to study their relative contribution to overall stability. Results indicate that local active power control loop will induce a right-half-plane zero (RHPZ) for certain high-power operating conditions, and the resulting inverse response leads system unstable. Meanwhile, the critical operating point at which the RHPZ arises is analytically derived, and demonstrated to be close to the actual dynamic stability boundary.",

        "abstract": "With the integration of more renewable energy, operational flexibility becomes a bottleneck for power system operation. Pumped storage units can enhance their operational flexibility by switching between different operation modes. They have limited capacity for adjustment when operated as generators and are non-adjustable when operated in the pump mode. However, the power ramps generated during the switching of operation modes are valuable for regulating the frequency and increasing the operational flexibility. In order to achieve sufficient performance, it is essential to have a method to determine the optimal switching time for the pumped storage units. However, there is no standard method to obtain the optimal switching time due to the complexities and non-linear characteristics of such a problem. In this paper, an enumeration based model predictive control (MPC) strategy is proposed to determine the optimal switching time of a pumped storage unit to enhance its operational flexibility and facilitate frequency regulation. Furthermore, a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated computing method is proposed to solve the problem effectively and to make the MPC controller suitable for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a novel approach of dramatically increasing the energy conversion efficiency of thermoelectric CaMnO ceramics through the combination of lattice dopants substitution and secondary phase segregation at the grain boundaries. The oxide ceramic samples are with the nominal composition of CaBiMnCuO (x=0, 0.02, 0.03; y=0.02, 0.04). When Cu is introduced into the CaBiMnCuO samples, the grain growth from Bi-doped CaMnO grains is accompanied by the limited solubility of Cu ions in the grain interior, while Cu mainly formed a CuO secondary phase at the grain boundaries. Cu non-stoichiometry addition subsequently resulted in the increase of the Seebeck coefficient and decreases of electrical resistivity simultaneously. The sample with designed chemistry of CaBiMnCuO exhibits the power factor of 2.4 mW mK at 337 K and Figure of Merit ZT of 0.67 at 773 K. This ZT of 0.67 is by far the highest ZT reported for various perovskites oxide ceramics. Such enhancements in electrical power factor and the overall ZT are attributed to the synergistic effect of decreasing the carrier concentration to increase the Seebeck coefficient and simultaneously increasing the carrier mobility through the existence of CuO phase at the grain boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The present work demonstrates the feasibility of increasing the values of Seebeck coefficient  S  and power factor of calcium cobaltite Ca 3 Co 4 O 9  ceramics through competing dopant grain boundary segregation. The nominal chemistry of the polycrystalline material system investigated is Ca 3\u2212x Bi x Ba y Co 4 O 9  with simultaneous stoichiometric substitution of Bi for Ca and non-stoichiometric addition of minute amounts of Ba. There is continuous increase of  S  due to Bi substitution and Ba addition. The electrical resistivity also changes upon doping. Overall, the power factor of best performing Bi and Ba co-doped sample is about 0.93\u00a0mW\u00a0m \u22121 \u00a0K \u22122 , which is one of the highest power factor values ever reported for Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 , and corresponds to a factor of 3 increase compared to that of the baseline composition Ca 3 Co 4 O 9.  Systematic nanostructure and chemistry characterization was performed on the samples with different nominal compositions. When Bi is the only dopant in Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 , it can be found at both the grain interior and the grain boundaries GBs as a result of segregation. When Bi and Ba are added simultaneously as dopants, competing processes lead to the segregation of Ba and depletion of Bi at the GBs, with Bi present only in the grain interior. Bi substitution in the lattice increases the  S  at both the low and high temperature regimes, while the segregation of Ba at the GBs dramatically increase the  S  at low temperature regime.",

        "abstract": "The impact of the non-stoichiometric addition of potassium (K) on the nanostructure and thermoelectric performance of misfit layered calcium cobaltite (Ca3Co4O9) ceramics is reported. The samples were prepared with the designed nominal composition of Ca3Co4O9Kx (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2). The K addition promoted the crystal growth and improved the crystal texture. The nanostructure and chemical analysis revealed the segregation of K at the Ca3Co4O9 grain boundaries, while the Ca3Co4O9 grain interior was free of K. At the optimal doping level, the dopant K grain boundary segregation reduced the electrical resistivity and simultaneously increased the Seebeck coefficient, resulting in a large increase in the power factor. At 320 K, the sample Ca3Co4O9K0.1 achieved the power factor of 930 \u03bcW K\u22122 m\u22121, which is 2.25 times higher than 412 \u03bcW K\u22122 m\u22121 from pristine Ca3Co4O9 and by far, the highest power factor at room temperature regime for the Ca3Co4O9 ceramics. The impact of the dopant segregation on the ionic diffusion along the grain boundaries and its resultant thermoelectric performance enhancement of Ca3Co4O9 ceramics are discussed.",

Upon the electrochemical operation, the ALD coated cell has dramatic reduction of the polarization resistance, and the power density exhibits continuous increase over the course of 172\u202fh operation at 750\u202f\u00b0C and reaches the cell performance enhancement by a factor of 1.6, in comparison with that from the baseline operated for 96\u202fh. Such performance enhancement was attributed to the combination of the newly added triple phase boundaries for promoting the oxygen reduction reaction, as well as the accelerated oxygen transport on the cathode surface.

        "abstract": "We report on the influence of sintering gas atmosphere on the thermoelectric (TE) performance of Ca3Co4O9 + \u03b4 ceramics made from precursor powders synthesized using chemical sol\u2013gel route. Two sets of polycrystalline pellets were sintered in air and oxygen atmosphere, respectively. Sintering gas atmosphere and sintering temperature were found to have great influence on the Ca3Co4O9 + \u03b4 crystal orientation and formation of the Co3O4 secondary phase. All samples, regardless of sintering atmosphere, had similar Seebeck coefficients S that increased with measurement temperature. By contrast, the electrical resistivity \u03c1 changed dramatically as the sintering temperature and atmosphere changed. For samples sintered in air, when the sintering temperature is above 1193 K, \u03c1 increased as the sintering temperature increased. For samples sintering in oxygen, \u03c1 decreased monotonically as the sintering temperature increased up to 1253 K. Benefited from the reduced \u03c1, the electrical power factor of the sample sintered in the oxygen at 1253 K is 0.539 mW m\u22121 K\u22122, and 40% greater than that from the sample sintered at 1193 K in air. Dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT of the sample sintered at 1253 K in oxygen is 0.28 at 1073 K, which is 20% greater than that of samples sintered in air at 1193 K. Overall, the highest TE performance was obtained for Ca3Co4O9 + \u03b4ceramics sintered in oxygen at 1253 K, which is significantly higher than the Ca3Co4O9 + \u03b4 decomposition temperature of 1199 K in air.",

        "title": "Effect of Fetal Growth on 1-Year Mortality in Neonates With Critical Congenital Heart Disease.",
        "abstract": "Background Infants with critical congenital heart disease ( CCHD ) are more likely to be small for gestational age (GA). It is unclear how this affects mortality. The authors investigated the effect of birth weight Z score on 1-year mortality separately in preterm (GA <37\u00a0weeks), early-term (GA 37-38\u00a0weeks), and full-term (GA 39-42\u00a0weeks) infants with CCHD . Methods and Results Live-born infants with CCHD and GA 22 to 42\u00a0weeks born in California 2007-2012 were included in the analysis. The primary predictor was Z score for birth weight and the primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ). The authors identified 6903 infants with CCHD . For preterm and full-term infants, only a Z score for birth weight <-2 was associated with increased mortality compared with the reference group ( Z score 0-0.5, adjusted odds ratio, 2.15 [95% CI , 1.1-4.21] and adjusted odds ratio, 3.93 [95% CI , 2.32-6.68], respectively). In contrast, in early-term infants, the adjusted odds ratios for Z scores <-2, -2 to -1, and -1 to -0.5 were 3.42 (95% CI , 1.93-6.04), 1.78 (95% CI , 1.12-2.83), and 2.03 (95% CI , 1.27-3.23), respectively, versus the reference group. Conclusions GA seems to modify the effect of birth weight Z score on mortality in infants with CCHD . In preterm and full-term infants, only the most severe small-for-GA infants ( Z score <-2) were at increased risk for mortality, while, in early-term infants, the risk extended to mild to moderate small-for-GA infants ( Z score <-0.5). This information helps to identify high-risk infants and is useful for surgical planning.",

This study investigates the association between maternal dyslipidemia and subsequent preterm birth among pregnant women in the state of California. Births were identified from California birth certificate and hospital discharge records from 2007-2012 (N = 2,865,987). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks completed gestation and dyslipidemia was defined by diagnostic codes. Subtypes of preterm birth were classified as preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), spontaneous labor, and medically indicated, according to birth certificate data and diagnostic codes. The association between dyslipidemia and preterm birth was tested with logistic regression. Models were adjusted for maternal age at delivery, race/ethnicity, hypertension, pre-pregnancy body mass index, insurance type, and education. Maternal dyslipidemia was significantly associated with increased odds of preterm birth (adjusted OR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.39, 1.59). This finding was consistent across all subtypes of preterm birth, including PPROM (adjusted OR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.34, 1.76), spontaneous (adjusted OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.39, 1.65), and medically indicated (adjusted OR: 1.454, 95%CI: 1.282, 1.649). This study suggests that maternal dyslipidemia is associated with increased risk for all types of preterm birth.",

To aid the development of better understanding of these phenotypes, we performed a controlled longitudinal weight perturbation study combining multiple omics strategies (genomics, transcriptomics, multiple proteomics assays, metabolomics, and microbiomics) during periods of weight gain and loss in humans. Results demonstrated that: (1) weight gain is associated with the activation of strong inflammatory and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy signatures in blood; (2) although weight loss reverses some changes, a number of signatures persist, indicative of long-term physiologic changes; (3) we observed omics signatures associated with insulin resistance that may serve as novel diagnostics; (4) specific biomolecules were highly individualized and stable in response to perturbations, potentially representing stable personalized markers. Most data are available open access and serve as a valuable resource for the community.",

        "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed considerable advancements in sequencing technologies, which have allowed comprehensive investigation of genetic variation of individuals at a moderate cost and within a reasonable time frame. Personalized disease risk and drug response predictions based on genomic sequences are a cornerstone of preventive precision medicine, and have also been successful at informing therapeutic decisions. However, genomics is limited in predicting the onset of most common diseases (i.e., cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders) because genetic information is mostly static and does not account for dynamic environmental (i.e., diet and lifestyle) or gut microbiota influences.Metabolomics, the study of a large collection of metabolites, offers the advantage to measure the functional readout of activity and phenotype encoded in the genome. Hence, combining genetic and metabolic information provides a unique opportunity to gain further insights on how the genetic program is translated into biological function through metabolites, and how alterations in the program associate with the onset of diseases. This approach has already proven very useful at diagnosing and understanding the pathogenesis of rare inherited metabolic disorders. Furthermore, metabolic profiles are influenced by the environment and the gut microbes; thus metabolomics has the potential to unravel the impact of nongenetic factors on disease onset as well as reveal early biomarkers that may improve risk assessment and diagnosis of complex diseases. Thanks to rapid improvements in technology, mass spectrometry\u2013based metabolomics can now robustly profile a broad spectrum of metabolites at a relatively low cost (1).The concept that genetic variations can be captured at the metabolite level in a population was first demonstrated in 2008 by Gieger et al. (2). That study gave a glimpse of the usefulness of combining genetic information with metabolic traits to understand the pathogenesis of common diseases and the influence of environment.

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a growing health problem, but little is known about its early disease stages, its effects on biological processes or the transition to clinical T2D. To understand the earliest stages of T2D\u00a0better, we obtained samples from 106 healthy individuals and individuals with prediabetes over approximately four years and performed deep profiling of transcriptomes, metabolomes, cytokines, and proteomes, as well as changes in the microbiome. This rich longitudinal data set revealed many insights: first, healthy profiles are distinct among individuals while displaying diverse patterns of intra- and/or inter-personal variability. Second, extensive host and microbial changes occur during respiratory viral infections and immunization, and immunization triggers potentially protective responses that are distinct from responses to respiratory viral infections. Moreover, during respiratory viral infections, insulin-resistant participants respond differently than insulin-sensitive participants. Third, global co-association analyses among the thousands of profiled molecules reveal specific host-microbe interactions that differ between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals. Last, we identified early personal molecular signatures in one individual that preceded the onset of T2D, including the inflammation markers interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL-1RA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) paired with xenobiotic-induced immune signalling. Our study reveals insights into pathways and responses that differ between glucose-dysregulated and healthy individuals during health and disease and provides an open-access data resource to enable further research into healthy, prediabetic and T2D states.",

        "abstract": "The lasing behaviours of semiconductor micro/nanostructures were studied in different gaseous surroundings, and the lasing threshold of the nanowire was reduced from 10.5 MW/cm<sup>2</sup> in air to 9.82 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 8.25 MW/cm<sup>2</sup> and 7.22 MW/cm<sup>2</sup> in Ar, N<sub>2</sub> and He environment, respectively. It is attributed to the transient polarization of molecular gas. Moreover, the narrow-bandwidth lasing from the junction of a comb-like microstructure is hard to realize compared to that in nanowire and nanobelt due to the absence of good resonance cavities, and the only amplified spontaneous emission was observed by the ICCD dynamic images of the photoluminescence. The PL spectra and ICCD dynamic images, as well as lifetime measurement, prove the occurrence of lasing in nanowires and nanobelts with the pumping power increase, which should originate from the exciton-electron scattering and the formation of EHP, respectively. The whispering-gallery-mode lasing in nanowire and Fabry-Perot-Mode lasing in nanobelt were intuitively demonstrated by the ICCD images. The results provide one route to reduce the lasing threshold by the gas protection.",

        "abstract": "Improvement in detection accuracy is an important and hot topic for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Discharged-pulse assisted (DPA) plasma has been investigated as an effective way to enhance analytical capabilities and accuracy of LIBS. Most of reported DPA experiments have been performed using high voltage and power to comprehend spectrum enhancement. For safety concerns and maneuverability of LIBS equipment; low power and small current discharge are viable for industrial application. In this paper, the enhanced spectra with many extra peaks and higher line intensities were also detected, realized by a low-power discharge assisted LIBS (Max. 2.8 kV and ~1 mA), which are much lower than reported in literature ~MW discharge. The number of atomic peaks of the sample increases, on the other hand, and gradual peaks become stronger with the increase of discharged HV from 1 kV to 1.5 kV, 1.75 kV, 2 kV, 2.5 kV and 2.8 kV. The discharge current increases from 0.2 mA to 1.5 mA, which is almost threshold discharge voltage. After processing, the original spectra, including the peak shift and peak correction by statistics and physics, resulted in achievement of better line stability in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD) of ash, carbon, and volatile coal samples with root mean square error prediction (RMSEP) of 0.4864, 0.3682, 0.3374 and the linear regression coefficient R = 0.99, 0.99,0.98, respectively. The result proposes a promising method to improve detection accuracy of LIBS with simple setup, high safety and low-cost.",

Different from the traditional hot embossing nanoimprint technique, in our imprint process, the external force applied to the soft stamp is provided just by using our hand. Since the stress can be well released, the stamp can be easily released after the hot stage cooling down. So the optical window (K9 glass) substrates with imprinted two-dimensional SiO2 cylindrical photonic nanostructures show good light diffraction property. Also, our experiment demonstrates that with the imprinted sample annealing at 200\u2218C, the density of SiO2 will be increased and the diffraction efficiency can be further enhanced. In addition, the light splitting characteristic can still keep good for a larger (6 inch) substrate, which has a certain radian. This illustrates that this nanoimprint method can be compa...",

        "abstract": "Drought is a type of natural disaster that has the most significant impacts on agriculture. Regional drought monitoring based on remote sensing has become popular due to the development of remote sensing technology. In this study, vegetation condition index (VCI) data recorded from 1982 to 2010 in agricultural areas of China were obtained from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data, and the temporal and spatial variations in each drought were analyzed. The relationships between drought and climate factors were also analyzed. The results showed that from 1982 to 2010, the agricultural areas that experienced frequent and severe droughts were mainly concentrated in the northwestern areas and Huang-Huai Plain. Moreover, the VCI increased in the majority of agricultural areas, indicating that the drought frequency decreased over time, and the decreasing trend in the southern region was more notable than that in the northern region. A correlation analysis showed that temperature and wind velocity were the main factors that influenced drought in the agricultural areas of China. From a regional perspective, excluding precipitation, the climate factors had various effects on drought in different regions. However, the correlation between the VCI and precipitation was low, possibly due to the widespread use of artificial irrigation technology, which reduces the reliance of agricultural areas on precipitation.",

        "abstract": "Drought is a complex natural phenomenon that can cause reduced water supplies and can consequently have substantial effects on agriculture and socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought and its relationship with meteorological factors in China. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) dataset calculated from NOAA/AVHRR images from 1982 to 2010 was used to analyse the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought in China. This study also examined the trends in meteorological factors and their influences on drought using monitoring data collected from 686 national ground meteorological stations. The results showed that the VCI appeared to slowly rise in China from 1982 to 2010. From 1982 to 1999, the VCI rose slowly. Then, around 2000, the VCI exhibited a severe fluctuation before it entered into a relatively stable stage. Drought frequencies in China were higher, showing a spatial distribution feature of \"higher in the north and lower in the south\". Based on the different levels of drought, the frequencies of mild and moderate drought in four geographical areas were higher, and the frequency of severe drought was higher only in ecologically vulnerable areas, such as the Tarim Basin and the Qaidam Basin. Drought was mainly influenced by meteorological factors, which differed regionally. In the northern region, the main influential factor was sunshine duration, while the other factors showed minimal effects. In the southern region and Tibetan Plateau, the main influential factors were sunshine duration and temperature. In the northwestern region, the main influential factors were wind velocity and station atmospheric pressure.",

In this study, the \u201c3S\u201d technology was used to obtain the ground survey data and ecological driving factors. Then the differences and correlations among the ecological driving factors were analyzed. The binary logistic regression model was used to study the habitat selection and spatial distribution prediction of rhinolophidae in Wuling mountain area. The results showed that the rhinolophidae preferred area far from the roads and resident land and near the rivers. The reason may be that the rivers could provide the water and food source for the activities of the rhinolophidae. While the human disturbance was serious near the roads and resident land, there was a certain restriction on the predatory behavior and commuting behavior of the rhinolophidae. This led to the phenomenon of plaque separation and seriously affected the survival and development of the rhinolophidae. So it is recommended to protect the surrounding water body and take full account of the human activities on the impact of the rhinolophidae habitat in the process of economic construction and resource development, to improve the habitat quality of rhinolophidae and protect the survival and reproduction of the population.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Separation and recovery of V(IV) from the synthetic sulfuric acid solutions containing Fe(III) and Al(III) were investigated using the bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA)-impregnated resin (DIR). It is confirmed that D2EHPA was incorporated to the support by comparing the characteristics of the support resin and DIR using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), respectively. Batch experiments proved that the adsorption capacity of Fe(III) on the DIR was by far higher than that of V(IV) and Al(III), and the separation factor of Fe(III) to V(IV) reached the plateau at the pH ranging from 1.0 to 1.2, which provided feasibility for the V(IV) separation from the solutions by column mode. During the preferential removal of Fe(III) by the DIR, it was shown that effective Fe(III) removal can be achieved at feed flow rate of 1.0\u00a0mL/min, column height of 18\u00a0cm and solutions pH 1.0. Subsequently, 1.5\u00a0mol/L H 2 SO 4  and 30\u00a0g/L H 2 C 2 O 4  was appropriate for the stepwise elution of partial loaded V(IV) and Fe(III), respectively. The iron-removed effluent was combined with the following eluted vanadium-bearing solutions and then was further processed by the DIR. Finally, the vanadium-rich solutions were obtained by stripping with 1.0\u00a0mol/L H 2 SO 4 . The total recovery of vanadium was 91.47% and it was concentrated almost 5 times. This study provides potential method for the separation and recovery of V(IV) from acid aqueous solutions by solvent impregnated resins.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effect of support properties on preparation process and adsorption performances of solvent impregnated resins (SIRs) has been studied. Five SIRs were prepared by impregnating di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) in five macroporous absorbent resins (MARs), respectively and used to extract V(IV) from aqueous solutions. The impregnation equilibrium can be fast achieved for the MARs with smaller pore size and bigger specific surface area, where D2EHPA is preferentially adsorbed in the micropores approximately as wall-spreading to form monolayer films, resulting in the relatively high utilization efficiency of extractant and stability of the SIRs. However, the extractant is more likely to accumulate in the macropores and/or mesopores than in the micropores, which leads to the higher mass ratio of extractant and pore-filling percentage in the SIRs with abundant macropores and/or mesopores. D2EHPA can be adsorbed on XAD-7HP fabricated with poly(methyl methacrylate) by virtue of relatively strong Hydrogen-bond, thus it can exist not only inside the pores but also on the surface of the resin, which causes the high mass ratio of extractant and extremely high pore-filling percentage although it contains the minimum pore volume. The relatively strong hydrogen-bond between XAD-7HP and D2EHPA is also believed to be responsible for its high adsorption capacity for V(IV) and utilization efficiency of the impregnated extractant.",

        "abstract": "Many methods have recently been proposed for efficient analysis of case-control studies of gene-environment interactions using a retrospective likelihood framework that exploits the natural assumption of gene-environment independence in the underlying population. However, for polygenic modelling of gene-environment interactions, which is a topic of increasing scientific interest, applications of retrospective methods have been limited due to a requirement in the literature for parametric modelling of the distribution of the genetic factors. We propose a general, computationally simple, semiparametric method for analysis of case-control studies that allows exploitation of the assumption of gene-environment independence without any further parametric modelling assumptions about the marginal distributions of any of the two sets of factors. The method relies on the key observation that an underlying efficient profile likelihood depends on the distribution of genetic factors only through certain expectation terms that can be evaluated empirically. We develop asymptotic inferential theory for the estimator and evaluate its numerical performance via simulation studies. An application of the method is presented.",

We examine the secondary analysis problem when multiple covariates are available, while only a regression mean model is specified. Despite the completely parametric modeling of the regression mean function, the case-control nature of the data requires special treatment and semi-parametric efficient estimation generates various nonparametric estimation problems with multivariate covariates. We devise a dimension reduction approach that fits with the specified primary and secondary models in the original problem setting, and use reweighting to adjust for the case-control nature of the data, even when the disease rate in the source population is unknown. The resulting estimator is both locally efficient and robust against the misspecification of the regression error distribution, which can be heteroscedastic as well as non-Gaussian. We demonstrate the advantage of our method over several existing methods, both analytically and numerically.",

        "abstract": "Analysing secondary outcomes is a common practice for case-control studies. Traditional secondary analysis employs either completely parametric models or conditional mean regression models to link the secondary outcome to covariates. In many situations, quantile regression models complement mean-based analyses and provide alternative new insights on the associations of interest. For example, biomedical outcomes are often highly asymmetric, and median regression is more useful in describing the 'central' behaviour than mean regressions. There are also cases where the research interest is to study the high or low quantiles of a population, as they are more likely to be at risk. We approach the secondary quantile regression problem from a semiparametric perspective, allowing the covariate distribution to be completely unspecified. We derive a class of consistent semiparametric estimators and identify the efficient member. The asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. Simulation results and a real data analysis are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach with a comparison with the only existing approach so far in the literature.",

We relax both assumptions. We construct a semiparametric estimator in case-control studies exploiting gene\u2013environment independence, while the distributions of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures are both unspecified and the disease rate is assumed unknown and is not required to be close to zero.

This study aims to quantitatively analyze the evolution of features and structure of international iron flow by combining the theory of Substance Flow Analysis and Complex Network. The network model was constructed based on the iron substance flow embodied in the trade among all the countries in the world. Trade density, concentration of trade activities, concentration of trade volumes, and hierarchy structure of the network were studied. Results show that the trade density of iron-contained commodities can act as the \u201cbarometer\u201d of world economy; the concentration of trade activities shows a reverse relationship with the world economic prosperity; the trade volumes are highly concentrated in a small number of countries; and the hierarchy structure of the network of international iron flow is becoming more obvious.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Embodied carbon emissions (ECE) of iron-containing commodities (ICC) in international trade are an important basis for effectively allocating both carbon emissions responsibility and emission quotas among countries. China is a major consumer of iron resources worldwide and the worldu0027s largest trader in ICC. Accurately calculating the ECE of ICC in Chinau0027s international trade is of great significance to objectively evaluate Chinau0027s carbon emissions responsibilities and to rationally allocate carbon emission quotas among countries. In this study, we verified the carbon emission factor for Chinau0027s import and export of ICC and analyzed the ECE of ICC between China and other countries worldwide from 2010 to 2015. The results are as follows. (1) The ECE of Chinau0027s export of ICC is higher than those of imported ICC. (2) In 2010\u20132015, the amount of iron materials in the import and export of China increased to 192 and 138 million tons, respectively. Most of the iron material imported by China is iron ore (about 90%), and more than 98% of Chinau0027s exported iron material is iron-containing end products (IEPs) and rolled steel. (3) The ECE of Chinau0027s imports of ICC decreased from 98 million tons in 2010 to 77 million tons in 2015 and consisted primarily of rolled steel and IEPs. The ECE of Chinau0027s exports of ICC increased from 249 million tons in 2010 to 482 million tons in 2015 and consisted primarily of IEPs and rolled steel. (4) The ECE of Chinau0027s exports of ICC are much larger than that the exports of ICC. The ECE of net exports of ICC, primarily to the United States, Vietnam, South Korea, and Indonesia, increased from 151 million tons in 2010 to 405 million tons in 2015. (5) The ECE of exports of ICC were approximately 4.7% of Chinau0027s domestic carbon emissions (calculated using the production-based principle) in 2015. The total amount of Chinau0027s domestic carbon emissions in the production-based principle is huge, but a large part is embodied in ICC exported to other countries worldwide. The shared responsibility principle (SRP) can better reflect the fairness and also contribute to the global participation of climate policy, which has the highest effectiveness. Therefore, calculation of carbon emissions using the SRP is a more objective assessment of Chinau0027s carbon emissions responsibility, thus making the allocation of carbon credits among countries more fair and reasonable.",

This study presents an iron material flow analysis that incorporates all iron-containing commodities, including IEPs (iron-containing end products). We analyzed material and value flows of iron-containing commodities between China and other countries worldwide. The results are as follows. (1) During the period from 2010 to 2016, the total amounts of iron materials imported to and exported from China increased by 224 million tons and 81 million tons, respectively. (2) 90% of the iron material imported by China consisted of iron ore and was imported from Australia and Brazil. More than 98% of the iron material exported from China consisted of rolled steel and IEPs (mainly engineering machinery and land vehicles), and were exported to Japan, South Korea, and the United States. In 2014, the export volume of rolled steel exceeded that of IEPs. (3) China had an international iron trade surplus, which increased from 31 billion USD in 2010 to 272 billion USD in 2016 at an average annual growth rate of 130%. According to this, some suggestions on how to optimize the resource allocation in the industrial chain of iron-containing products and the international trade policy of iron-containing products were put forward.",

Different with the 2D/1D method that utilizes 1D calculation to get the axial leakage, here introduces a 2D/3D coupling method employing the 3D S N  method to get the axial leakage. Compared with the 2D/1D method, because of the better axial leakage from the 3D S N  method, the 2D/3D could decrease the number of MOC layers while keeping the accuracy. In another word, it could improve the accuracy with the same axial mesh size. In the paper, the theory and leakage analysis of this 2D/3D coupling method is introduced. And a small test problem is given to show the leakage comparison of axial leakage between the 2D/1D method and 2D/3D method. Finally the results of the 3D C5G7 problems are given to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the 2D/3D method.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe deviations brought by the embedded self-shielding method with the pseudo-resonant isotope model is investigated. Numerical results show that error sources mainly come from the inconsistency in the heterogeneous resonance integral (RI) generated in the two-dimensional square pin\u2013cell case with reflective boundary conditions. The high-order resonance interference effect also contributes to the deviation. The black assumption on the macroscopic cross section of the fuel is proposed to enhance the consistency in the generation of the heterogeneous RI table. Numerical results show that the modification on the original embedded self-shielding method improves the accuracy of the cross-section prediction in the multifuel lattice systems.",

In the 2D/1D transport method, negative total source may occur for MOC calculation in iteration process, which will lead to iteration divergence. The negative total source in the MOC equation is studied and an improved leakage splitting method is proposed to improve stability for 2D/1D transport method in this paper. With the new method, the accuracy is preserved while the memory cost only increases slightly. Finally, high leakage cases, the C5G7 and VERA benchmark are tested to show the accuracy and performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The enhanced thermal conductivity oxide (ECO) nuclear fuel with BeO is analyzed from the aspect of neutronics. The Westinghouse 17\u202f\u00d7\u202f17 pressurized water reactor lattice model is selected as the reference and the influence on the neutronic features of different volume fractions of BeO is investigated by Monte Carlo depletion code Serpent. Results from criticality calculation of fresh fuel and depletion calculation show that increasing the fraction of BeO in the fuel will lead to more penalty on reactivity caused by extra neutron capture while the increasing moderating effect of BeO will increase the reactivity provided by the fuel. The two opposite effects compete with each other to decide the final impact the cycle length. As a result, different amount of enrichment of  235 U is needed to maintain the reactivity evaluated in different models. The moderating effect leads to the softening of the spectrum and less accumulation of  239 Pu when adding more BeO in the fuel. From the investigation of the radial profile, the spatially self-shielding effect decreased with the increasing of the volume fraction of BeO. Reactivity perturbation analysis show that adding BeO in the fuel causes the moderator coefficient to become less negative, which should be a concern for the reactor safety. In the analysis of the leading assembly with several standard UO 2  fuel replaced with UO 2 -BeO, the pin power distributions of leading assemblies show the power defect at the position of the UO 2 -BeO fuel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The method of characteristics (MOC) is one of the most common methods for solving the neutron transport equation in practical application. Researches have been focused on the acceleration techniques and the parallel algorithm for improving the efficiency of MOC. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) provides an alternative method of parallelizing the MOC neutron transport sweep. In this work, a GPU-paralleled 2D MOC code is implemented, which employs the diamond difference (DD) scheme and the step characteristics (SC) scheme. Different parallel schemes which are ray-level, energy-group-level, and polar-angle-level, are analyzed to choose the proper parallel scheme. The C5G7 2D benchmark is calculated to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the code in different schemes with single precision and double precision. The bottlenecks of the GPU code are identified and the code is classified into three categories, which are compute-bound, memory-bound, and latency-bound, according to the performance analysis model introduced in this paper. In addition, corresponding optimization strategies are applied to improve the performance according to the analysis. Moreover, the speed, power efficiency, and hardware cost are compared for CPU and GPU based on a fictitious quarter core PWR problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the energy group-level parallelization can obtain the optimal performance on GPU. Optimization strategies are effective to improve the efficiency of the calculation on GPU, which indicates that the performance analysis model is useful and effective to locate the limitation of the code. Moreover, the GPU-version code is about 30 times faster than the CPU-version code with double precision and about 100 times faster with single precision, while the desired accuracy is kept. And the GPU delivers superior performance in both speed, energy efficiency, and hardware cost.",

In most 2D/1D codes, a pin is chosen as a 1D calculation domain, which assumes that the axial leakage of the pin is flat on top/bottom surfaces. Similar to the axial leakage, the radial leakage of every 2D plane also introduces several approximations along axial direction for the 1D calculation. This paper studied the error introduced by both axial and radial leakages, and proposed a leakage reconstruction method according to the error analysis for the 2D/1D fusion method, in which MOC is applied to the radial 2D calculation and the Sn diamond difference method is used for the axial 1D calculation. Several cases are tested to show the performance of this leakage reconstruction method especially when the leakage term is significant.",

Lenalidomide has been proved to be effective for relapsed/refractory CLL as a single agent or in combination with various chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens. However, current clinical experience in its usage is still limited. Because of existing considerable variability in different studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to describe overall response rate (ORR) of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Pooled estimate of cumulative prevalence of total ORR was 42.23 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 32.49\u201352.61 %), while pooled ORR in regimen with lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAbs) and lenalidomide mono-therapy were 60.01 % (95 % CI, 53.86\u201365.86 %) and 24.38 % (95 % CI, 16.15\u201335.06 %), respectively. There was no significant difference between L + R (lenalidomide plus rituximab) group and L + O (lenalidomide plus ofatumumab) group, with pooled ORR of 66.38 % (95 % CI, 57.96\u201373.87 %) and 57.40 % (95 % CI, 46.46\u201367.65 %), respectively. When co-administrated with anti-CD20 mAbs, dosage of lenalidomide was not the key factor of ORR in combination therapy. Pooled ORR of patient with high-risk cytogenetic in L + anti-CD20 mAbs group was 56.74 % (95 % CI, 45.53\u201367.30 %). In comparison with patients without high-risk cytogenetic receiving the same treatment regimen, no significant difference was observed, with relative risk (RR) of 0.87 (95 % CI 0.68\u20131.11). Our finding demonstrated that lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 mAbs could be an efficient therapy regimen for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, especially for those with high-risk cytogenetic factor.",

However, the best therapeutic agent to treat VRE-BSI remains to be established. In order to provide evidence for an optimal treatment decision, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing the efficacy and safety of daptomycin and linezolid for the treatment of VRE-BSI. After thorough searching of relevant studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov and international meetings up to November 2015, 11 retrospective cohort studies were finally included with a sample size of 1339 patients. Among these 11 included studies, all patients in the daptomycin group received standard or high-dose daptomycin treatment (\u22656\u2009mg/kg/day). Data were extracted and pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. The meta-analysis indicated similar crude overall mortality between patients receiving daptomycin and those treated with linezolid (RR\u2009=\u20091.07, 95% CI 0.83\u20131.37). Moreover, no difference regarding clinical cure (RR\u2009=\u20091.11, 95% CI 0.88\u20131.42), microbiological cure (RR\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% CI 0.90\u20131.09) or relapse rate of VRE-BSI (RR\u2009=\u20091.08, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.52) was found between daptomycin and linezolid. Adverse event rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Currently available evidence indicates similar efficacy and safety of daptomycin and linezolid for the treatment of VRE-BSI. However, the findings in the meta-analysis are limited by heterogeneity between relatively small-scale retrospective studies and should be interpreted cautiously.",

Materials u0026 methods: To examine the role of common MTHFR variants in MTX toxicity prediction, we performed a meta-analysis via identifying relevant studies for quantitative data pooling. Results: Our results showed a significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and increased risk of MTX-induced all-grade (grade 1\u20134) and severe (grade 3\u20134) hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in Caucasian independent of MTX dosage. MTHFR 677T allele increased risk of severe mucositis and all-grade hematological toxicity. MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was not significantly associated with hepatic and hematological toxicity, whereas perhaps having a protective effect on mucositis and gastrointestinal toxicity. Conclusion: MTHFR C677T polymorphism may be a good predictor for MTX toxicity in adult hematological malignancies.",

The degradability after introducing spirulina extract (SP-E) to polycaprolactone (PCL) via particulate leaching to obtain SP-E/PCL scaffolds was characterized on the basis of their porosity, hydrophilicity, water absorption capacity, and degradability. Microscopy analysis showed that the pore sizes were in the range of 250\u2013300 \u03bcm including small interconnected pores within large pores because of some SP-E leaching out during the fabrication process. The hydrophilicity of the SP-E/PCL scaffold was considerably enhanced by introducing SP-E. The water contact angles of the SP-E/PCL scaffold decreased from 120\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 at 2 s followed by further decrease to 0\u00b0 at 7 s. The water absorption capacity increased from 2.5 to 8.5 times the original weight. SP-E/PCL scaffolds quickly degraded with increasing amounts of SP-E, and the percentage of weight loss increased from 2.2% (PCL scaffold) to 29.2% (20 wt% SP-E/PCL scaffold) after immersion in PBS for 25 d because of the co-degradation of SP-E and PCL. The molecular weight of SP-E/PCL-20 changed slightly after only 28 d degradation. The hydroxyl groups of the degraded SP-E/PCL-20 specimen were formed after 28 d. Moreover, the number of micropores formed on the surface of the scaffold after immersion in PBS for 25 d increased with increasing amounts of SP-E. Using SP-E as a secondary phase improved porosity, interconnectivity, hydrophilicity, and water absorption capacity and caused accelerated degradation between SP-E and PCL. These findings suggest that SP-E/PCL scaffolds have potential applications in tissue engineering.",

The integrity, color, solubility, microstructure, thermal properties, tensile strength, and compatibility of the SPG films are assessed. SPG films became smooth, homogeneous, and flexible after plasticizing with glycerol. The presence of PVA and hydrogen bonding of PVA with glycerol and spirulina protein improves the water resistance of SPG films by decreasing water absorption of spirulina protein and decreasing water diffusion through the films. The amount of carbonaceous residues decreases from 31% to 14% because of the co-pyrolysis of spirulina, PVA, and glycerol. TS increases from 2.5 to 26 Mpa and modulus from 53 to 610 Mpa with increasing PVA content. Glycerol enhances film flexibility and EAB up to 50%.

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is aberrantly expressed in a number of tumors. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the gene and protein levels of NNMT were significantly increased in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, upregulation of NNMT significantly increased the expression of mesenchymal markers, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin and fibronectin, but decreased the levels of epithelial cadherin. Since transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 may serve a key function in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the effects of NNMT on the expression of TGF-\u03b21 were investigated in BGC-823 cells. The results demonstrated that overexpression of NNMT significantly induced the expression of TGF-\u03b21. However, knockdown of NNMT inhibited the expression of TGF-\u03b21, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)2 and \u03b1-SMA. Additionally, pre-incubation with TGF-\u03b21 partially eliminated NNMT-mediated changes in EMT. Collectively, the results demonstrated that upregulation of NNMT in gastric cancer cells may increase the expression of TGF-\u03b21, therefore activating TGF-\u03b21/Smad signaling, which in turn promotes EMT.",

Using the cre-loxP system to selectively knock out AR in glyoxylate-induced calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal mouse models, we found that the mice lacking hepatic AR had less oxalate biosynthesis, which might lead to lower CaOx crystal formation, and that the mice lacking kidney proximal or distal epithelial AR also had lower CaOx crystal formation. We found that AR could directly up-regulate hepatic glycolate oxidase and kidney epithelial NADPH oxidase subunit p22-PHOX at the transcriptional level. This up-regulation might then increase oxalate biosynthesis and oxidative stress that resulted in induction of kidney tubular injury. Targeting AR with the AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9 led to suppression of CaOx crystal formation via modulation of oxalate biosynthesis and oxidative stress in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Taken together, these results established the roles of AR in CaOx crystal formation.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), an emerging new technology, had been reported to safely, effectively and en blot dissection method for gastrointestinal epithelial tumors treatment, which maybe a better en blot desection approach for NMIBC treatment. The present study is to compare the efficacy and safety of bladder tumor-endoscopic submucosal dissection (BT-ESD) and conventional transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURBT) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder tumor (NMIBC). METHODS: A prospective trial was carried out in Shaanxi Provincial People\u2019s Hospital (Shaanxi, China), 75 patients eligible suspicious NMIBC, between November 2013 and Oct 2014, were constructively enrolled in and randomized to use of either the BT-ESD (ESD Group, 38 cases) or the TURBT treatment (TURBT group, 37 cases). The operation time, blood loss, postoperative bladder irrigation time, catheter indwelling time, hospital stay, complications and 1-year tumor recurrence rate were compared between 2 groups. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with comparable characteristics between groups were included. The ESD group showed increased average operation time than TURBT group (30.2 9.2 min v.s 15.08 6.1 min, pu003c 0.05), respectively, no significant difference were found in the smaller tumor (0-2cm). The postoperative bladder irrigation time, catheter indwelling time and hospital stay in BT-ESD group were significantly shorter than TURBT group (8.3 2.8h, 2.3 0.9d and 3.0 1.3d for ESD group;16.7 3.6h, 4.8 1.3d and 6.5 1.8d for TURBT group). In addition, the BT-ESD group showed decreased overall incidence of complications (7.9% v.s 18.9%, pu003c0.05) and 1-year tumor recurrence rate (5.3% v.s 21.6%, p u003c 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that BT-ESD as a novel approach used for NMIBT appears to be a feasibly safe and applicable. Compared with conventional TURBT, BT-ESD applies an en bloc resection technique following the principles of oncologic surgery by using HybirdHnife to facilitate histopathologic assessment more accurate and reach a R0 resection. This is much critical for planning strategy of intravesical instillation, assessing prognosis and determining the protocol of follow-up, with respective potential advantages in decreasing rates of tumor recurrence and progression, and reducing socioeconomic costs. Clearly, BT-ESD appears to benefit the patients and is worth popularizing application in clinic.",

With increasing rolling reduction, smaller clusters that consisted of many finer spherical ZrB 2  nanoparticles were uniformly distributed along the rolling direction (RD). In addition, the uniform distribution and smaller ZrB 2  particle accelerated the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) process to further refine the dynamically recrystallized (DRXed) grains. During the hot rolling process, the tensile properties increased with increasing reduction ratio. Tensile tests showed that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and elongation (El) increased to 356\u202fMPa, 289\u202fMPa and 28.1%, respectively, due to the uniform distribution of the particle clusters, the smaller size of the nanoparticles, and the refinement of the DRXed grains upon increasing the rolling reduction to 80%, in combination with T4 heat treatment and artificial ageing. In addition, the mechanisms of particle dispersion, recrystallization grain refinement and strengthening are also discussed.",

The effects of the coupled magnetic and ultrasonic field on the nanoparticle distribution, morphology and tensile properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. The results indicated that with increase in the magnetic frequency and ultrasonic power to 10\u202fHz and 1.5\u202fkW, respectively, the large particle clusters were broken into smaller clusters that were uniformly distributed in the matrix, the distribution of the ZrB 2  nanoparticles was diffuse and homogeneous with a size decreased to 10\u201380\u202fnm, and the corners of the nanoparticles clearly became obtuse. The optimal ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS) and elongation (El) of the composite prepared under the coupled field were 363\u202fMPa, 240\u202fMPa and 24.1%, respectively, corresponding to increases of 36.6%, 55.5% and 64% over the respective properties of the AA6111 alloy. The synergistic functions of the ultrasonic and magnetic fields were also discussed. The effects of the magnetic field and ultrasonic field were different.",

The security-related data is varied. It is helpful to integrate the different types of data from multiple resources to support the further analysis such as abnormal detection or damage prediction. Considering the data complexity, this paper proposes a framework to automatically integrate security-related data in an electric system using ontology reasoning. In this paper, we try to determine the relationship between the ontology or between the local ontology and the global ontology through certain reasoning rules to help establish the data structure automatically.

In this paper, an abnormal detection framework for electric security data is proposed based on scenario modeling that supplies the descriptions of typical security issues. In this framework, the electric power system security-related data is first collected from different resources in real time. Then we create a scenario model based on the historical data for the typical security issues such as warning, system error or fatal error using the association rule mining algorithms. Then multiple scenario models are tagged with indicators that are observable from the sensors or monitors. Finally, the real-time data is analyzed to detect the defined indicators based on which the possible security scenarios are predicted and corresponding operation or protection will be activated automatically. The experiment results suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify and prevent the many of the common issues in the electric system.",

Copper concentration in the tissues of L. hexandra from CP increased markedly correlated with the concentration of metal in the culture solution, and this trend was stronger than that in NCP. Copper concentrations in roots and shoots were significantly higher in CP than NCP. As Cu stress levels in the culture solution rose, the transport coefficient of both populations decreased. Furthermore, the coefficient of CP was significantly higher than NCP. At a Cu concentration of 38.4 mg/L, the transfer factor value of CP is 40% higher than NCP. In summary, CP showed higher ...",

The results showed that L. hexandra had a high extraction capacity for copper (Cu), and Cu concentration was found maximum in shoots (755.4\u202fmg/kg), which is very close to the Cu-hyperaccumulators. Three successive harvests did not reduce the biomass and Cu level in shoots of L. hexandra (p\u202fu003e\u202f0.05), indicating that sequential harvest was feasible for the increase of total biomass and Cu extraction amount. Fertilization could obviously increase the tissue dry weight, resulting in the total amount of extracted-Cu up to 52.3%. 3-Indole acetic acid (IAA) also significantly increased biomass, causing the efficiency of Cu phytoextraction up to 204.6%. These suggested that fertilization and IAA were effective for enhancing Cu phytoextraction by L. hexandra.",

        "abstract": "Click-baits are headlines that exaggerate the facts or hide the partial facts to attract user clicks. Click-baits deter readers from effectively and efficiently obtaining information in the era of information explosion, and will obviously affect user experience in news aggregator sites like Google News and Yahoo News. Detecting and preventing click-baits become crucial. Previous work achieved remarkable performances on this task with hand-crafted lexical and syntactic features on limited platforms. However, this line of work heavily depend on expertise knowledge and can not be easily applied to languages that do not share such features. To address above issues, we propose a general end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network based approach, which utomatically induces useful features for the end task without relying on any external resources. Empirical experiments on English and Chinese corpus show that our method achieves consistent results, showing the effec- tiveness and robustness of our approach across languages. We will share our annotated corpus collected from Chinese news news sites on publication.",

        "abstract": "Sentence classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing. In this paper, clickbait detection is taken as an example to study the sentence classification with a transferring network. Clickbait are news headlines that exaggerate the facts or hide partial facts headlines. Statistics show that clickbaits are prevalent among all languages. However, previous research on clickbait detection mainly focus on English, exploiting lexical or syntactical features that are not shared by other languages. On the other hand, it would be both time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate a clickbait dataset by humans. Recently, neural language model that represent each word by a real-valued, dense vector show that words with similar meanings across languages are close to each other in the vector space. Inspired by this, transfer learning is proposed to be applied to transfer the model on clickbait detection from a source language to other languages with very few annotations. This paper trains the source model on English corpus and transfers it to corpus in Chinese. Experimental results show that transfer learning model in this paper can achieve similar performance on the target language using less annotation, showing the effectiveness and robustness of this model.",

Early approaches extract lexical and syntactic features, which are discrete and sparse and can hardly capture the semantic relatedness between words. Recent advances in deep learning, which represents text segments into dense and continuous vectors, has shed light on this problem. However, the main limitation is they are usually based on complex neural network structure, which are resource-consuming to train and make inference. To remedy this, we propose a novel text representation approach which considers word local and global importance via the BM25 weighing schema. We use word vectors pretrained from large text corpus to capture the latent semantic relatedness between words. Experimental results show that our approach is effective and efficient compared with existing feature-based, unsupervised and supervised baselines.",

Most existing trackers only consider short-term tracking, therefore are unable to cope with partial and complete occlusion, which finally leads to object drifting or loss. Our method still follows the tracking-by-detection framework. However, after choosing kernelized correlation filter as the tracker baseline, we introduce the confidence of candidate patches to measure tracking reliability, and trigger redetection process with random forest and learned object model when needed. We further improve object update strategy to make the object model with memory more robust against object drift. Extensive experiment results on UAV videos show that our algorithm performs better than widely used TLD, KCF, and LCT methods.",

Epidemiological investigation was carried out among HIV-infected individuals. Blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV were tracked for the date of transfusion, reason for transfusion, hospital where transfusion was received, source of blood, components of transfusion, number of transfusions, and transfusion volume. A total of 285 blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV-1 were detected in Hebei over the study period, with 42.81% (122/285) detected through clinical diagnostic testing. These cases showed a concentrated distribution in southern Hebei, with local outbreak characteristics. A census of the population in Shahe County, which had a high concentration of cases, revealed that recipients of blood transfusions had an HIV infection rate of 15.54% (92/592). Post-transfusion infection frequently occurred among blood transfusion recipients at township medical institutions, with a peak in 1995. Owing to late detection of HIV infection among blood transfusion recipients, the rates of spousal transmission and mother-to-child transmission reached 20.87% and 28.05%, respectively. Around 1995, community medical institutions did not screen for HIV antibodies among paid blood donors, which was an important cause of the outbreak of HIV-1 infection among blood transfusion recipients. Our findings indicate that cases of blood transfusion-related infection decreased rapidly with gradual improvement in the HIV screening system for blood donors that began in 1995, particularly after full implementation of HIV nucleic acid testing of volunteer blood donors was begun in 2015.",

A four-level dust stress (i.e. severe, moderate mild stress and normal status) experiment was conducted using the wheat in growing season as the study object. The spectra of wheat leave which treated with different stress intensity levels were collected by AvaSpec-2048\u00d714-USB2 Spectrometer, and 32 samples were obtained for each level. All of the samples were divided randomly into two groups, one group with 96 ones used as calibrated set, and another with 32 ones as prediction set. The spectra data were pretreated by the methods of S.Golay smoothing and baseline correction. Using vegetation indices (VIs) designed for dust pollution stress diagnosis (i.e. dust stress normalized index, DSNI) as the model input variables, and the values of stress level as the output variables, the hyperspectral diagnosis models of dust stress intensity were established by random forest classification algorithm. And then 32 unknown samples were predicted by the diagnosis model. The result showed that the prediction accuracy was 87.5%, indicating it was feasible to diagnose the dust stress intensity with the new designed VIs.",

With the development of remote sensing technology, regional drought monitoring based on remote sensing has become the mainstream. The temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) datasets recorded from 2001 to 2010 in Huang-huai-hai region were obtained by using MODIS data, and the temporal and spatial variations in drought were analyzed. The results showed that the drought condition inland Huang-huai-hai region was severer than that near coastal area from 2001 to 2010, and the severest drought regions were mainly distributed in the places like north of Henan and north of Anhui. Meanwhile, with the passage of time, the drought condition in Huanghuai-hai region was reducing year by year.",

        "abstract": "Habitat selection by the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) in the Wuling Mountains was studied in this paper. Global positioning system (GPS), remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies were used to obtain ground survey data and analyse the habitat factors driving the distribution of R. sinicus. Based on these basic data, a binary logistic regression method was used to establish habitat selection models of R. sinicus. Then, the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICC) was used to screen an optimal model, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that the optimal model has suitable goodness of fit. Finally, the optimal model was used to predict the spatial distribution of R. sinicus in the Wuling Mountains. Verification analysis showed that the overall accuracy of the model was 72.7% and that the area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.947, which indicated that the model was effective for predicting suitable habitat for R. sinicus. The model results also showed that the main factors that influenced habitat selection were slope, annual mean temperature and distances from roads, rivers and residential land. R. sinicus preferred areas far from roads and residential land and areas near rivers. Generally, higher values of slope and annual mean temperature were associated with a greater likelihood of R. sinicus presence. Therefore, the protection of the water bodies surrounding R. sinicus habitats and fully addressing the impacts of human activities on R. sinicus habitats are recommended to protect the survival and reproduction of the population.",

        "abstract": "Information concerning the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetative drought is essential for decision-making and for many environmental and agricultural applications. This study presents a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of vegetative drought conditions that used the vegetation condition index (VCI) data product obtained from NOAA/AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) to reveal the vegetative drought patterns across China from 1981 to 2015. Considering the characteristics of VCI as drought indicators, multiple methods were designed for these analyses, including drought frequency analysis, trend analysis, anomaly index analysis, and Mann-Kendall testing. The results show that China is a country with high vegetative drought frequency, but that most areas experienced only slight or moderate periods of drought. In addition, drought has obvious seasonal and geographical differences and occurs with greater frequencies in regions that are highly affected by monsoons such as the northern and southern regions\u2014particularly in the spring and autumn. In contrast, vegetative drought frequencies in regions less affected by monsoons such as the Tibetan Plateau and the northwestern regions were much lower except in northern Sinkiang, eastern Inner Mongolia, and southern Tibet. During 1981\u20132015, the VCI had an increasing trend in most areas of China (except in the southern region, where it decreased), indicating a reduced frequency of vegetative drought throughout the country. Moreover, the trend was wavelike rather than a one-way change and could be divided into four phases: (1) a slowly increasing phase from 1981 to 1990, (2) an intensively fluctuating phase from 1991 to 2000, (3) a steadily increasing phase from 2001 to 2010, and (4) a slowly decreasing phase after 2010. Mann-Kendall analysis further suggested that upward trends of the VCI were more evident in spring and autumn than in summer and that both trends mutated in 1997. Specifically, the trend reached the 0.05 level of significance in the spring.",

Fifty hyperspectral vegetation indices VIs, such as the photochemical reflectance index PRI and canopy chlorophyll index CCI, were compared to identify the appropriate VIs for crop LCC and CCC inversion. The hybrid inversion models were then generated from different modelling methods, including the curve-fitting and least squares support vector regression LS-SVR and random forest regression RFR algorithms, by using simulated Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer CHRIS datasets that were generated by a radiative transfer model. Finally, the remote-sensing mapping of a CHRIS image was completed to test the inversion accuracy. The results showed that the remote-sensing mapping of the CHRIS image yielded an accuracy of R2 = 0.77 and normalized root mean squared error NRMSE = 17.34% for the CCC inversion, and an accuracy of only R2 = 0.33 and NRMSE = 26.03% for LCC inversion, which indicates that the remote-sensing technique was more appropriate for obtaining chlorophyll content at the canopy scale CCC than at the leaf scale LCC. The estimated results of various VIs and algorithms suggested that the PRI and CCI were the optimal VIs for LCC and CCC inversion, respectively, and RFR was the optimal method for modelling.",

        "abstract": "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used for Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation. It is well documented that the NDVI is extremely subject to the saturation problem when LAI reaches a high value. A new multi-angular vegetation index, the Hotspot-darkspot Difference Vegetation Index (HDVI) is proposed to estimate the high density LAI. The HDVI, defined as the difference between the hot and dark spot NDVI, relative to the dark spot NDVI, was proposed based on the Analytical two-layer Canopy Reflectance Model (ACRM) model outputs. This index is validated using both in situ experimental data in wheat and data from the multi-angular optical Compact High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) satellite. Both indices, the Hotspot-Darkspot Index (HDS) and the NDVI were also selected to analyze the relationship with LAI, and were compared with new index HDVI. The results show that HDVI is an appropriate proxy of LAI with higher determination coefficients (R2) for both the data from the in situ experiment (R2=0.7342, RMSE=0.0205) and the CHRIS data (R2=0.7749, RMSE=0.1013). Our results demonstrate that HDVI can make better the occurrence of saturation limits with the information of multi-angular observation, and is more appropriate for estimating LAI than either HDS or NDVI at high LAI values. Although the new index needs further evaluation, it also has the potential under the condition of dense canopies. It provides the effective improvement to the NDVI and other vegetation indices that are based on the red and NIR spectral bands.",

        "abstract": "Spiral capsule robots can be applied to human gastrointestinal tracts and blood vessels. Because of significant variations in the sizes of the inner diameters of the intestines as well as blood vessels, this research has been unable to meet the requirements for medical applications. By applying the fluid dynamic equations, using the computational fluid dynamics method, to a robot axial length ranging from 10 to 10\u2009m, the operational performance indicators (axial driving force, load torque, and maximum fluid pressure on the pipe wall) of the spiral capsule robot and the fluid turbulent intensity around the robot spiral surfaces was numerically calculated in a straight rigid pipe filled with fluid. The reasonableness and validity of the calculation method adopted in this study were verified by the consistency of the calculated values by the computational fluid dynamics method and the experimental values from a relevant literature. The results show that the greater the fluid turbulent intensity, the greater the impact of the fluid turbulence on the driving performance of the spiral capsule robot and the higher the energy consumption of the robot. For the same level of size of the robot, the axial driving force, the load torque, and the maximum fluid pressure on the pipe wall of the outer spiral robot were larger than those of the inner spiral robot. For different requirements of the operating environment, we can choose a certain kind of spiral capsule robot. This study provides a theoretical foundation for spiral capsule robots.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have examined the performance of production systems with shared resources through the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA). The present models are based on the multiplier-type frameworks and resource allocation variables (RAVs) in simple yet edifying network settings, such as multi-component and two-stage structures. Two issues associated with RAVs, however, are relevant to both the theory and practice. First, the existing models with RAVs are nonlinear in general. Second, a potential conflict of interest between a central evaluator (CE) and the managers of decision-making units (DMUs), due to the unknown allocation parameters, has not been addressed. The current study contributes to the resolution of these issues by presenting conflict free models (CFMs). Two striking features of the proposed models include their convenient transformation into linear programs and that they are conflict free. Thus, the manager of a DMU has no basis to argue against the evaluation results by simply claiming that faulty information regarding the split of shared resources has been used, as no such information relating to the CE\u2019s preference or pertaining to RAVs is included in the model formulation. Furthermore, we investigate the relations between CFMs and the existing models, strengthening the interpretations of the existing models. Finally, the proposed models incorporate partial ordering preferences expressed as the cone ratio constraints, which are suitable for a wide range of real life applications. A dataset extracted from literature is used to illustrate the main concept that drives this research.",

Possible suggestions are also proposed for various industries and some salient enterprises.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIt has been suggested that organizations capable of pursuing exploration and exploitation simultaneously obtain superior performance. Ambidextrous organizations often have multiple and conflicting goals, which can pose considerable challenges for top managers. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the ambidextrous leadership of chief executive officers (CEOs) influences the ambidextrous behavior of top management team (TMT) members. The analysis of multisourcesurvey data reveals that CEO ambidextrous leadership predicts TMT-member ambidextrous behavior. The relationship is mediated by TMT behavioral integration (i.e. collaborative behavior, information exchange and joint decision-making). Moreover, the indirect relationship is moderated by TMT-member risk propensity. Theoretical contributions and research implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, performance evaluation of sustainable operations has attracted a significant amount of research. The current paper seeks to evaluate sustainable manufacturing performance when wastes are recycled and re-used. For example, a typical sustainable process in iron and steel making involves in the first stage forging iron and steel products and in the second stage disposing the wastes. The sustainable manufacturing process then re-uses the recycled waste water in the first stage production. It is important that performance metrics include the operations related to recycling and re-use of the wastes. In a simplified view, such a sustainable operation is a two-stage process. Due to the ability of incorporating multiple performance metrics, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to develop our evaluation approach. While traditional DEA treats such two-stage manufacturing process as a black box by ignoring the internal conflicts and cooperation among multiple manufacturing stages, this paper proposes a modified two-stage network DEA model that deals with good and undesirable outputs from the sustainable manufacturing process. A Nash bargaining game between efficiencies of two-stages is proposed to produce unique and fair efficiency decomposition for the two-stage sustainable manufacturing process. The modified two-stage network DEA model is applied to wastewater recycling and reusing in a set of iron and steel makers in China. The results show that the proposed model is more effective than the black box DEA model in calculating efficiency of both two-stages and in identifying the sources of the inefficiency of overall sustainable manufacturing processes.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the most vital urogenital malignant disease worldwide, bringing huge economic and social burden every year. Clinically, BCa is subdivided into superficial type and invasive type according to clinic-pathology, accompanied with different strategy of therapy. Number of reports indicate that 10-30% of superficial BCa will inevitable progress into invasive type, manifesting enhanced malignant behavior compared to original invasive type. Regardless of the original being an original invasive type or invasive type that progressed from superficial type of BCa, chemotherapy (including adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy) in line with radiotherapy is the final regimen for BCa patients. Previous reports pointed out the high efficiency of cisplatin-containing chemotherapeutic regimen for BCa patients, leading to wide use of this regimen in BCa therapeutics. However, cisplatin-resistance inevitably appear, resulting in the failure of the BCa chemotherapy, the mechanism of which is still unknown. In the present study, parental BCa cell lines T24/J82 were used to obtain stable-cisplatin-resistance cell lines T24R/J82R, which showed enhanced capacity of malignancy, tumorigenesis and drug resistance, accompanied by elevated expression of EMT markers. The further mechanism investigation suggested that prolonged time of cisplatin-treatment contributed to the activation of the NF-\u03baB signal, resulting in the upregulation of EMT markers, the maintenance of stem cell marker and the elevated expression of ABCB1. Thus, our study provides us a new view of the role of NF-\u03baB signaling in BCa therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the 9th most common malignant tumor and the 13th leading cause of death due to cancer. The development of surgery and target drugs bring new challenges for the traditional concept for BCa therapy, and chemotherapy is still the final option for many BCa patients, and cisplatin-containing regimen the most effective one. However, the ubiquitous application of cisplatin-containing regimen in BCa results in the cisplatin-resistance, in addition, the cisplatin\u2011resistant BCa manifests enhanced malignant behavior, the mechanism of which is unclear. In the present study, we used BCa cell lines to to clarify this point. BCa cell lines T24/J82 were pretreated with cisplatin >3 months to construct stable cisplatin-resistant cell lines (tagged T24Cis-R and J82Cis-R), which manifested as enhanced capacity of proliferation and malignant behavior in vivo and in vitro, accompanied by cisplatin, and even doxorubicin resistance. The following mechanism dissection revealed that prolonged treatment time of T24/J82 cells led to elevated expression of HIF-1\u03b1, which targeted the increased expression of MDR1 on the one hand, and contributed to BCa cell proliferation, migration/invasion on the other hand. Finally, IHC staining of human BCa tissue supported our conclusion that the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and MDR1 was higher in chemoresistant tissue vs. chemosensitive tissue. Our results provided a new view of HIF-1\u03b1 in chemotherapy.",

A partial elliptical contact is formed by contact bodies under a normal force and a transverse force that is insufficient to cause complete sliding. A computational model based on the semi-analytical method is established to calculate the von Mises stress distribution. Furthermore, a parametric study on factors influencing the location of the maximum von Mises stress point, such as the coefficient of friction and stick zone ratio, is conducted. Results show that the location of the maximum von Mises stress point depends on the coefficient of friction f and stick zone ratio c. The von Mises stress increases significantly with the increasing coefficient of friction f. Moreover, the maximum von Mises stress point tends to occur at a subsurface when the stick ratio c increases.",

The cushion characteristics of hydraulic cylinder directly affect its performance and reliability, especially the one utilized in hydraulic system with fast response, high flow rate, and instantaneous super power. In order to analyze the cushion characteristics, three different simulation models are established. Furthermore, experiments concerning the pressure characteristics of hydraulic cylinder are accomplished to verify the validation of simulation models. It was found that the integrated simulation model had the highest precision and CFD model showed better pattern of cushion process compared with other models. On the basis of the integrated simulation model, plunger structure and key structural parameters were studied in detail with optimal schemes given. The conical structure, proper design of the diameter of cushion hole, and length of plunger turned out to be effective in promoting the cushion performance. The proposed simulation models and research of cushion structure have scientific and engineering value to promote the innovative development of hydraulic cylinder.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of the melanocortin receptors is linked to the evolution of ACTH, the MSHs, and their common precursor POMC. The origin of the melanocortin receptors and POMC appears to be grounded in the early radiation of the ancestral protochordates. During the genome duplications that have occurred during the evolution of the chordates, the organization plan for POMC was established, and features that have been retained include, the high conservation of the amino acid sequences of \u03b1-MSH and ACTH, and the presence of the HFRW melanocortin receptor activation motif in all of the melanocortin peptides (i.e., ACTH, \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-MSH, \u03b3-MSH & \u03b4-MSH). For the melanocortin receptors, the chordate genome duplications resulted in the proliferation of paralagous receptor genes, and a divergence in ligand selectivity. While, most gnathostome melanocortin receptors can be activated by either ACTH or the MSHs, teleost and tetrapod MC2R orthologs can only be activated by ACTH. The appearance of the accessory protein, MRAP1, paralleled the emergence of teleost and tetrapods MC2R ligand selectivity, and the dependence of these orthologs on MRAP1 for trafficking to the plasma membrane. The accessory protein, MRAP2, does not affect MC2R ligand selectivity, but does influence the functionality of MC4R orthologs. In this regard, the roles that these accessory proteins may play in the physiology of the five melanocortin receptors (i.e., MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R & MC5R) are discussed.",

        "title": "60 YEARS OF POMC: Melanocortin receptors: evolution of ligand selectivity for melanocortin peptides",
        "abstract": "The evolution of the melanocortin receptors (MCRs) is linked to the evolution of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), the melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSHs), and their common precursor pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). The origin of the MCRs and POMC appears to be grounded in the early radiation of the ancestral protochordates. During the genome duplications that have occurred during the evolution of the chordates, the organization plan for POMC was established, and features that have been retained include, the high conservation of the amino acid sequences of \u03b1-MSH and ACTH, and the presence of the HFRW MCR activation motif in all of the melanocortin peptides (i.e. ACTH, \u03b1-MSH, \u03b2-MSH, \u03b3-MSH, and \u03b4-MSH). For the MCRs, the chordate genome duplication events resulted in the proliferation of paralogous receptor genes, and a divergence in ligand selectivity. While most gnathostome MCRs can be activated by either ACTH or the MSHs, teleost and tetrapod MC2R orthologs can only be activated by ACTH. The appearance of the accessory protein, MRAP1, paralleled the emergence of teleost and tetrapods MC2R ligand selectivity, and the dependence of these orthologs on MRAP1 for trafficking to the plasma membrane. The accessory protein, MRAP2, does not affect MC2R ligand selectivity, but does influence the functionality of MC4R orthologs. In this regard, the roles that these accessory proteins may play in the physiology of the five MCRs (i.e. MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R) are discussed.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of IL-37 in renal cell carcinoma (Rcc). Serum IL-37 levels in 120 Rcc patients and 50 healthy controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Rcc cell lines A498 and Caki-1 were cultured with 0\u2013100 ng/mL of recombinant human IL-37 protein (rhIL-37). Cancer cells were transfected with or without pcDNA3.1-IL-6 to alter IL-6 expression. Cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis were tested by wound-healing assay, MTT, and flow cytometry, respectively. Levels of IL-6, pSTAT3 Y705, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, and HIF-1\u03b1 were detected by qRT-PCR, ELISA, or western blot. Additionally, therapeutic effect of rhIL-37 was also confirmed in SCID mice. The expression of IL-37 was decreased in Rcc patients and was negatively correlated with tumor progression. In vitro, IL-37 markedly inhibited the migration and proliferation, and promoted apoptosis in Rcc cells. Furthermore, the expressions of IL-6, pSTAT3 Y705, HIF-1\u03b1, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1 were decreased by IL-37. However, these effects were reversed by the transfection of pcDNA3.1-IL-6. In vivo, tumor growth and gene expressions of IL-6 and HIF-1\u03b1 were suppressed by IL-37. In conclusion, IL-37 might serve as a novel tumor suppressor in Rcc and exert its antitumor activity through inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling.",

        "abstract": "Vascular dysfunction is a distinctive phenotype in diabetes mellitus. Current treatments mostly focus on the tight glycemic control and few of these treatments have been designed to directly recover the vascular dysfunction in diabetes. As a classical natural medicine, berberine has been explored as a possible therapy for DM. In addition, it is reported that berberine has an extra-protective effect in diabetic vascular dysfunction. However, little is known whether the berberine treatment could ameliorate the smooth muscle contractility independent of a functional endothelium under hyperglycemia. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether berberine affects the arterial contractility by regulating the intracellular Ca(2+) handling in vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) under hyperglycemia.Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the diabetic model with a high-fat diet plus injections of streptozotocin (STZ). Berberine (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) were intragastrically administered to control and diabetic rats for 8 weeks since the injection of STZ. The intracellular Ca(2+) handling of isolated cerebral VSMCs was investigated by recording the whole-cell L-type Ca(2+) channel (CaL) currents, assessing the protein expressions of CaL channel, and measuring the intracellular Ca(2+) in response to caffeine. Our results showed that chronic administration of 100 mg/kg/day berberine not only reduced glucose levels, but also inhibited the augmented contractile function of cerebral artery to KCl and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in diabetic rats. Furthermore, chronic administration of 100 mg/kg/day berberine significantly inhibited the CaL channel current densities, reduced the \u03b11C-subunit expressions of CaL channel, decreased the resting intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) level, and suppressed the Ca(2+) releases from RyRs in cerebral VSMCs isolated from diabetic rats. Correspondingly, acute application of 10 \u03bcM berberine could directly inhibit the hyperglycemia-induced CaL currents and suppress the hyperglycemia-induced Ca(2+) releases from RyRs in cerebral VSMCs isolated from normal control rats.Our study indicated that berberine alleviated the cerebral arterial contractility in the rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes via regulating the intracellular Ca(2+) handling of smooth muscle cells.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating tumor angiogenesis. MicroRNA-93-5p (miR-93-5p) has been identified as an oncogenic miRNA in a variety of human malignancies and involved in tumor angiogenesis in astrocytoma. However, the direct effect(s) of miR-93-5p on the biological behaviors of endothelial cells have not been investigated. Thus, in the present study we investigated the role(s) of miR-93-5p in regulating the functions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues with higher levels of miR-93-5p showed higher blood vessel density. Overexpression of miR-93-5p accelerated HUVECs proliferation and migration and promoted HUVECs lumen formation and sprouting in vitro, while blockade of miR-93-5p suppressed HUVECs migration and angiogenic capacity. The mechanistic studies revealed that miR-93-5p can promote angiogenic process through inhibiting epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) expression in HUVECs. In sum, our results have indicated that miR-93-5p promoted angiogenesis through down-regulating EPLIN and therefore represented a promising target for developing novel anti-angiogenic therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia and hypertension are considered to be the two leading risk factors for vascular disease in diabetic patients. However, few pharmacologic agents could provide a combinational therapy for controlling hyperglycemia and hypertension at the same time in diabetes. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether berberine treatment could directly reduce blood pressure and identify the molecular mechanism underlying the vascular protection of berberine in diabetic rats. Berberine was intragastrically administered with different dosages of 50, 100 and 200\u2009mg/kg/day to diabetic rats for 8 weeks since the injection of streptozotocin. The endothelium-dependent/-independent relaxation in middle cerebral arteries was investigated. The activity of large-conductance Ca-activated K channel (BK) was investigated by recording whole-cell currents, analyzing single-channel activities and assessing the expressions of \u03b1- and \u03b21-subunit at protein or mRNA levels. Results of the study suggest that chronic administration of 100\u2009mg/kg/day berberine not only lowered blood glucose but also reduced blood pressure and improved vasodilation in diabetic rats. Furthermore, berberine markedly increased the function and expression of BK \u03b21-subunit in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from diabetic rats or when exposed to hyperglycemia condition. The present study provided initial evidences that berberine reduced blood pressure and improved vasodilation in diabetic rats by activation of BK channel in VSMCs, which suggested that berberine might provide a combinational therapy for controlling hyperglycemia and blood pressure in diabetes. Furthermore, our work indicated that activation of BK channel might be the underlying mechanism responsible for the vascular protection of berberine in diabetes.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. We aimed to determine the potential binding proteins of p12CDK2-AP1 and to elucidate the role of p12CDK2-AP1 in the regulation of the proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and in\u00a0vivo growth of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. The protein-protein interaction was predicted using computational decision templates. The predicted p12CDK2\u2011AP1 interacting proteins were overexpressed in human oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC-15 cells, and the protein binding was examined using co-precipitation (Co-IP). Cell proliferation and invasion were determined via MTT assay and Transwell system, respectively. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin\u00a0V-FITC/PI double staining followed by flow cytometric analysis. The in\u00a0vivo growth of OSCC-15 cells was examined in nude mouse tumor xenografts. We found that overexpression of either p12CDK2-AP1 or CD82 significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion but promoted the apoptosis of OSCC-15 cells (P<0.05). Importantly, combined overexpression of p12CDK2-AP1 and CD82 showed synergistic antitumor activity compared with the overexpression of a single protein alone (P<0.05). Additionally, the simultaneous overexpression of p12CDK2-AP1 and CD82 significantly suppressed the in\u00a0vivo tumor growth of OSCC-15 cells in nude mice compared with the negative control (P<0.05). Our findings indicate that p12CDK2-AP1 interacts with CD82 to play a functional role in suppressing the in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo growth of OSCC-15 cells. ",

The present study aimed to examine the role of the overexpression of KAI1 in the progression of oral cancer. Human KAI1/CD82 cDNA was transfected into OSCC\u201115 and 293T cell lines, and its effects on OSCC\u201115 cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by performing a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Matrigel invasion and Annexin V\u2011FITC staining, respectively. In addition, a xenograft model was used to assess the effect of KAI1/CD82 on the in\u00a0vivo growth of tumors. The overexpression of KAI1/CD82 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of OSCC-15 cells. It also enhanced the apoptotic rate of the OSCC\u201115 cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of KAI1/CD82 inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of KAI1/CD82 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human oral cancer cells, and inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. Therefore, KAI1/CD82 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target in oral cancer.",

Therefore, in an effort to illustrate whether ADH1C 1/2 polymorphism is associated with AD risk in Turkish population, we used meta analysis to synthetically evaluate the effect of ADH1C 1/2 polymorphism on AD. Publications were identified by searching in PubMed and EMBASE databases. Four eligible studies involving 400 controls and 421 cases were included in this study. Overall, there is a significant association between ADH1C 1/2 polymorphism and AD risk in the allelic model (OR\u202f=\u202f1.66, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.05-2.62, P\u202f=\u202f0.03) and recessive model (OR\u202f=\u202f1.72, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.14-2.58, P\u202f=\u202f0.01), while no significance was discovered in the dominant genetic model, homozygote model and heterozygotemodel. No publication bias was indicated from Begg's and Egger's test. Our meta-analysis results suggested that a potential relationship between ADH1C 1/2 polymorphism and AD risk in Turkish population. Further studies are confirmed to resolve this question about the etiological mechanisms of the correlation.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have reported that MTHFR C677T (rs 1801133) polymorphism is associated with the risk of alcohol dependence(AD). However, there are conflicting results regarding this relationship. In this article, we performed a meta-analysis of case-control studies to assess synthetically the influence of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on the risk of AD. All relevant studies were searched from Cochrane Library, EmBase, PubMed, and Web of science. 7 studies were included to evaluate the strength of associations between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AD by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The present meta-analysis evaluated a total of 1066 AD patients and 1049 controls and showed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not significantly associated with AD susceptibility in all five genetic models (Allelic, T vs C: OR\u202f=\u202f1.04,95% CI: 0.83-1.31, P\u202f=\u202f0.73; Homozygous, TT vs CC: OR\u202f=\u202f0.98,95% CI: 0.57-1.68, P\u202f=\u202f0.94; Heterozygous, TT vs CT: OR\u202f=\u202f0.87,95% CI: 0.64-1.19, P\u202f=\u202f0.39; Dominant, TT\u202f+\u202fCT vs CC: OR\u202f=\u202f1.12,95% CI: 0.92-1.35, P\u202f=\u202f0.26; Recessive, TT vs CT\u202f+\u202fCC: OR\u202f=\u202f0.93,95% CI: 0.58-1.47, P\u202f=\u202f0.74). On subgroup analysis by ethnicity, there was still insignificant association was detected in the Caucasians and Asians under the five genetic models respectively. In conclusion, the present data revealed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism may not be associated with AD susceptibility. Further well designed studies in a larger population and biological functional analysis of MTHFR are needed to elucidate the role of MTHFR C677T Gene polymorphism in AD.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota disturbance significantly increases the risk of emotional disorders via the gut-brain axis, but the mechanism is unclear. Furthermore, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) deficits were reported to be implicated in the development of depression and amnesia, but the alterations in the GABA-A receptor subunits that are involved in the pathogenetic process have not been fully elucidated. This study used juvenile rats that were fed ampicillin-Na to establish degree III dysbiosis of the intestinal flora and examined emotional change via the tail suspension test, forced swim test and Morris water maze. Additionally, our study investigated the expression of GABA-A receptor \u03b15 and \u03b4 subunits in the hippocampus in adulthood via q-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We focused on the role of GABA-A receptor \u03b15 and \u03b4 subunit changes induced by juvenile gut microbiota disturbance in the pathogenesis of emotional disorders in adulthood. In addition, we investigated the protective effects of probiotics and benzodiazepine (clonazepam). Findings showed that juvenile gut microbiota disturbances induced chronic depression and memory loss and reduced the expression of GABA-A receptor \u03b15 and \u03b4 subunits in the hippocampus of the adult rat. Furthermore, moderate probiotic administration led to a significant improvement compared to short-term BZ treatment. However, we are aware that these results have been established with a single animal experiment and will require further confirmation with a larger group of individuals. Future directions for the exploration of the effects of gut microbiota disturbance on GABA-A receptor \u03b15 and \u03b4 subunits are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the capability of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a fully Lagrangian mesh-free method, to simulate the bulk blood flow dynamics in two realistic left ventricular (LV) models. Three dimensional geometries and motion of the LV, proximal left atrium and aortic root are extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and multi-slice computed tomography imaging data. SPH simulation results are analyzed and compared with those obtained using a traditional finite volume-based numerical method, and to in vivo phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography data, in terms of the large-scale blood flow phenomena usually clinically measured. A quantitative comparison of the velocity fields and global flow parameters between the in silico models and the in vivo data shows a reasonable agreement, given the inherent uncertainties and limitations in the modeling and imaging techniques. The results indicate the capability of SPH as a promising tool for predicting clinically relevant large-scale LV flow information.",

        "abstract": "The patient-specific biomechanical analysis of the aorta requires in vivo mechanical properties of individual patients. Existing approaches for estimating in vivo material properties often demand high computational cost and mesh correspondence of the aortic wall between different cardiac phases. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-resolution direct search (MRDS) approach for estimation of the nonlinear, anisotropic constitutive parameters of the aortic wall. Based on the finite element (FE) updating scheme, the MRDS approach consists of the following three steps: (1) representing constitutive parameters with multiple resolutions using principal component analysis (PCA), (2) building links between the discretized PCA spaces at different resolutions, and (3) searching the PCA spaces in a 'coarse to fine' fashion following the links. The estimation of material parameters is achieved by minimizing a node-to-surface error function, which does not need mesh correspondence. The method was validated through a numerical experiment by using the in vivo data from a patient with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA), the results show that the number of FE iterations was significantly reduced compared to previous methods. The approach was also applied to the in vivo CT data from an aged healthy human patient, and using the estimated material parameters, the FE-computed geometry was well matched with the image-derived geometry. This novel MRDS approach may facilitate the personalized biomechanical analysis of aortic tissues, such as the rupture risk analysis of ATAA, which requires fast feedback to clinicians.",
