        "abstract": "Electrochemical performance of silver-modified Ba0.5Sr 0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-\u03b4 (BSCF-Ag) as oxygen reduction electrodes for a protonic intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC-H+) with BaZr0.1Ce0.8Y 0.1O3 (BZCY) electrolyte was investigated. The BSCF-Ag electrodes were prepared by impregnating the porous BSCF electrode with AgNO3 solution followed by reducing with hydrazine and then firing at 850 \u00b0C for 1 h. The 3 wt.% silver-modified BSCF (BSCF-3Ag) electrode showed an area specific resistance of 0.25 \u03a9 cm2 at 650 \u00b0C in dry air, compared to around 0.55 \u03a9 cm2 for a pure BSCF electrode. The activation energy was also reduced from 119 kJ mol-1 for BSCF to only 84 kJ mol-1 for BSCF-3Ag. Anode-supported SOFC-H+ with a BZCY electrolyte and a BSCF-3Ag cathode was fabricated. Peak power density up to 595 mW cm-2 was achieved at 750 \u00b0C for a cell with 35 \u03bcm thick electrolyte operating on hydrogen fuel, higher than around 485 mW cm-2 for a similar cell with BSCF cathode. However, at reduced temperatures, water had a negative effect on the oxygen reduction over BSCF-Ag electrode, as a result, a worse cell performance was observed for the cell with BSCF-3Ag electrode than that with pure BSCF electrode at 600 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2010 Professor T.

        "title": "A mechanism study of synthesis of Li4Ti5O 12 from TiO2 anatase",
        "abstract": "The formation mechanism of a spinel-type lithium titanate Li 4Ti5O12 with TiO2 anatase as raw material, in both a conventional solid-state reaction (SSR) and a cellulose-assisted glycine-nitrate combustion (cellulose-GN) process are comparatively studied. XRD characterization demonstrates high-purity Li 4Ti5O12 forms at 750 \u00b0C by the cellulose-GN synthesis, which occurs at a temperature at least 100 \u00b0C lower than that via SSR. The solid-phase reaction between TiO2 and lithium compounds to form Li-Ti-O spinel and the phase transition of TiO2 from anatase to \"inert\" rutile phase occur competitively during both synthesis processes. SEM results suggest that the solid precursor from the cellulose-GN process has a smaller particle size and a more homogenous mixing of the reactants than that in the SSR. Temperature-programmed oxidation experiments demonstrate that cellulose thermal pyrolysis creates a reducing atmosphere, which may facilitate the oxygen-ion diffusion. Both factors facilitate the formation of Li-Ti-O spinel, while the TiO2 anatase transforms to TiO2 rutile during the SSR, which has slow lithium-insertion kinetics. As a result, a high calcination temperature is necessary to obtain a phase-pure Li4Ti5O12. Charge-discharge and EIS tests demonstrate the Li4Ti5O12 obtained by the cellulose-GN process shows much better low-temperature electrochemical performance than that obtained by standard SSR. This improvement attributes to the reduced particle size due to the lower synthesis temperature. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates dimethyl ether (DME) as a potential fuel for proton-conducting SOFCs with a conventional nickel cermet anode and a BaZr 0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-\u03b4 (BZCY4) electrolyte. A catalytic test demonstrates that the sintered Ni + BZCY4 anode has an acceptable catalytic activity for the decomposition and steam reforming of DME with CO, CH4 and CO2 as the only gaseous carbon-containing products. An O2-TPO analysis demonstrates the presence of a large amount of coke formation over the anode catalyst when operating on pure DME, which is effectively suppressed by introducing steam into the fuel gas. The selectivity towards CH4 is also obviously reduced. Peak power densities of 252, 280 and 374 mW cm-2 are achieved for the cells operating on pure DME, a DME + H2O gas mixture (1:3) and hydrogen at 700 \u00b0C, respectively. After the test, the cell operating on pure DME is seriously cracked whereas the cell operating on DME + H2O maintains its original integrity. A lower power output is obtained for the cell operating on DME + H2O than on H2 at low temperature, which is mainly due to the increased electrode polarization resistance. The selection of a better proton-conducting phase in the anode is critical to further increase the cell power output. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Synthesis and assessment of la0.8Sr0.2Sc yMn1-yO3-\u03b4 as cathodes for solid-oxide fuel cells on scandium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte",
        "abstract": "Perovskite-type La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc y Mn 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides (LSSM y , y = 0.0\u20130.2) were synthesized and investigated as cathodes for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) containing a stabilized zirconia electrolyte. The introduction of Sc 3+ into the B-site of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSM) led to a decrease in the oxides\u2019 thermal expansion coefficients and electrical conductivities. Among the various LSSM y oxides tested, LSSM0.05 possessed the smallest area-specific cathodic polarization resistance, as a result of the suppressive effect of Sc 3+ on surface SrO segregation and the optimization of the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. At 850 \u00b0C, it was only \u223c0.094 \u03a9 cm 2 after a current passage of 400 mA cm \u22122 for 30 min, significantly lower than that of LSM (\u223c0.25 \u03a9 cm 2 ). An anode-supported cell with a LSSM0.05 cathode demonstrated a peak power density of 1300 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C. The corresponding value for the cell with LSM cathode was 450 mW cm \u22122 under the same conditions. The LSSM0.05 oxide may potentially be a good cathode material for IT-SOFCs containing doped zirconia electrolytes. Keywords La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc y Mn 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Stabilized zirconia Solid-oxide fuel cell Cathode 1 Introduction Fuel cells are an attractive power generation technology characterized by high energy-conversion efficiency and low emissions. Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are all-solid-state devices and typically operate at high temperatures of 500\u20131000 \u00b0C [1\u20133] . Compared to low-temperature fuel cells, such as polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells, SOFCs have superior fuel flexibility and fast electrode reaction kinetics [4\u20136] . Currently, yttrium or scandium stabilized zirconia are still the most commonly used SOFC electrolytes due to their excellent mechanical properties, their favorable redox stabilities, and their acceptable ionic conductivities [7\u201311] . Although these materials\u2019 ionic conductivities are lower than those of doped ceria (i.e. samaria doped ceria) or lanthanum gallate (i.e., La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Ga 0.8 Mg 0.2 O 2.9 ), the resistance that these thin-film stabilized zirconia electrolytes contribute is still acceptable at intermediate temperatures [12,13] . If the electrolyte thickness can be reduced to 5\u201310 \u03bcm, SOFCs equipped with either yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) or scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolytes are capable of supplying applicable power densities at operating temperatures as low as 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. The reduction of oxygen has a high activation energy, so cathodic polarization resistance increases sharply with decreases in operating temperature. A high-performance cathode is therefore an essential component of intermediate-temperature (IT)-SOFCs. This study aims to develop novel cathode materials for IT-SOFCs containing stabilized zirconia electrolytes. An ideal cathode for IT-SOFCs should have high electrocatalytic oxygen-reduction activity, a thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) that is compatible with that of the electrolyte, high chemical and structural stability, and low reactivity towards the electrolyte under operating conditions. La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSM) is one of the most frequently used cathode materials in SOFCs containing YSZ/ScSZ electrolytes because the material possesses an appropriate TEC and favorable chemical compatibility. LSM, however, has negligible oxygen ionic conductivity, and oxygen reduction is strictly limited to the electrolyte\u2013electrode-gas triple-phase boundary (TPB) [14] . Decreasing the operating temperature drastically increases the cathodic polarization resistance to values so large that LSM does not act as a cathode at temperatures lower than 800 \u00b0C. Lanthanum cobaltite and related perovskite oxides have shown initial promise as cathodic materials for IT-SOFCs containing doped ceria electrolytes such as samaria doped ceria [15\u201317] . The anion and electron conductivities of such materials at reduced temperatures are sufficiently high that the active electrochemical reaction is not restricted solely to the TPB, but can exploit the entire cathode\u2013gas interface. Unfortunately, these materials do not perform as well with stabilized zirconia electrolytes [18,19] . At high temperatures, the lanthanum cobaltite cathode reacts with the stabilized zirconia electrolyte to form an electrically insulating layer of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 . This, of course, increases the electrode\u2013electrolyte interfacial polarization resistance. In addition, lanthanum cobaltite has a much higher TEC than stabilized zirconia [20] . The low chemical stability of these materials might also be a drawback [21] . Doping has been widely applied to modify the properties of LSM. We have demonstrated that Sc 3+ is an excellent dopant for cobalt-based perovskites [22,23] . In this study, we investigated the synthesis of new perovskite-type scandia-doped LSM oxides and investigated potential applications for these materials as the cathodes of IT-SOFCs containing a ScSZ electrolyte. The phase structure, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, cathodic polarization resistance, and single-cell SOFC performance of these oxides was systematically studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of LSSM y powders LSSM y composite oxides ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) were synthesized via an EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [24,25] . La(NO 3 ) 3 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O, and Sc 2 O 3 (all A.R. grade) were used as the raw materials. Sc 2 O 3 powder was first dissolved in nitric acid and heated, and Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , La(NO 3 ) 3 , and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O were then added. EDTA and citric acid were added to the mixture in sequence, and both acted as complexing agents. The pH of the solution was adjusted to \u223c6 via addition of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O. After evaporating the water from the mixture via heating, a transparent purple gel was obtained. The gel was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C forming a solid precursor, which was subsequently calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere to yield the final desired product. 2.2 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical characterization of these LSSM y cathode materials was conducted using a three-electrode electrochemical cell ( Fig. 1 ). Electrolyte disks were prepared from (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) powder by die-pressing. The disks were then sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. The thickness and diameter of a sintered disk was \u223c0.3 and 16 mm, respectively. A cathode slurry was sprayed onto each side of the electrolyte substrate such that application was as symmetric as possible. The substrate was then calcinated at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere to yield both the working and the counter electrodes. A reference electrode composed of silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai Research Institute of Synthetic Resins, Shanghai, China) was painted in a ring around the counter electrode. The gap between the counter and the reference electrodes was \u223c4 mm. The areas of the working, the counter, and the reference electrodes were 0.26, 0.26, and 0.3 cm 2 , respectively. Cathodic polarization resistance ( R p ) was measured via electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurement using a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat. The frequency range of EIS measurements was from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV. Data were collected using ZPlot 2.9c software. Measurements were conducted both with and without a current polarization treatment in which the electrodes were subjected to 400 mA cm \u22122 of current for 30 min. Cathodic overpotential was measured using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat, which was operated via Corrware 2.9c software. The polarization current density was varied from 0 to 400 mA cm \u22122 in 20 mA cm \u22122 intervals. Post-factum correction of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results was applied to correct for the IR drop corresponding to the electrolyte and lead resistances, thereby establishing resistance-free I / E characteristics. The series resistance data obtained from EIS measurements was used to make this correction. 2.3 Single-cell testing High-energy ball milling (FRITSCH, Pulverisette 6) was employed to prepare anodic powder composed of 60 wt% NiO and 40 wt% ScSZ. The electrolyte membrane was deposited onto the NiO + ScSZ substrate using a dual-dry-pressing technique and subsequent co-firing at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. This aimed in densifying the electrolyte layer and enhancing the adhesion between the two layers. A cathode slurry containing LSSM y ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) was sprayed onto the electrolyte surface and then calcinated at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. Silver paste was used as the current collector. A four-terminal configuration was used during the single cell tests. Fuel cell performance at temperatures between 650 and 850 \u00b0C was assessed via I \u2013 V characterization. Measurements were performed using a digital source meter (Keithley 2420) that was interfaced with a computer to facilitate data acquisition. 2.4 Other characterization The phase structures of the oxide materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer. Diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning angles (2 \u03b8 ) between 10\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. The morphological features of the prepared cells were examined with an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was measured using a Netsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer, which operated between room temperature and 1000 \u00b0C with an air purge flow rate of 50 ml min \u22121 (STP, standard temperature and pressure). The oxide's electrical conductivity was measured using a four-probe DC conductivity instrument. Prepared powders were ball-milled and subsequently pressed into green bars (5 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 25 mm) with stainless steel dies under a hydraulic load of 30 tons. The green bars were densified by sintering at 1300 \u00b0C for 5 h, silver paste electrodes were applied to each of the bars, and four wires were attached to the edges of the bar as current and voltage probes. Measurements were conducted at intervals of 10 \u00b0C from 300 to 900 \u00b0C using a Keithley 2420 source meter. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Basic characterization The room-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained for each of the LSSM y oxides prepared with varying Sc 3+ doping concentrations ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) ( Fig. 2 ). For all LSSM y samples, the diffraction peaks indexed well to perovskite structures with orthorhombic symmetry. This suggested that Sc 3+ was successfully incorporated into the B-site (manganese site) of the LSM lattice. In addition, each LSSM y oxide's set of lattice parameters was calculated ( Table 1 ). The lattice constant increased with increasing Sc 3+ doping concentration, and this result coincided with the larger ionic radius of Sc 3+ (0.745 \u00c5) compared to Mn 3+ (0.645 \u00c5) and Mn 4+ (0.53 \u00c5). The high-temperature phase reaction between LSSM y and ScSZ was examined by mixing them in a 50:50 weight ratio in the powder state, followed by calcinations at various temperatures for 5 h in air (XRD not shown). Only weak additional diffraction peaks indexed to the La 2 Zr 2 O 7 phase were observed at a calcination temperature of 1150 \u00b0C for LSSM y , while the reaction was negligible at a temperature of 1100 \u00b0C or lower. Considering the calcination at 1150 \u00b0C made better adhesion of the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface, it was selected for fabricating the electrode onto electrolyte surface. Detailed examination of the effect of the phase reaction on the electrode performance is not referenced in this study, but will be conducted in the future. Matching the thermal expansion coefficient of the electrode to that of the electrolyte is crucial to the fuel cell's long-term stability during thermal cycling. Between room temperature and 1000 \u00b0C, the various LSSM y oxides possessed TECs of 12.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 12.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 11.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , and 11.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 for y values of 0.0 (LSM), 0.05 (LSSM0.05), 0.1 (LSSM0.1), and 0.2 (LSSM0.2), respectively. The measured TEC of LSM matched the values published in the literature [26] . Both LSSM0.1 and LSSM0.2 possessed TECs smaller than LSM, implying that these materials were more compatible with the stabilized zirconia electrolyte than LSM [27] . The differences in TEC among the various LSSM y oxides were sufficiently small, so that any one of these materials was suitable in terms of its thermal expansion properties for application in cathodes adhering to stabilized zirconia electrolyte. Substitution of a lower oxidation state cation, such as Sr 2+ , for the La 3+ in the A-site of LaMnO 3 would create an electrical charge imbalance. Either an increase in the B-site metal ion's oxidation state (i.e. Mn 3+ \u2192 Mn 4+ ), or the formation of oxygen vacancies (V O \u2022\u2022 ) in the lattice structure must occur to compensate for this imbalance. In the case of LSM, the former phenomenon plays a larger role in restoring electrical charge balance. Electrical conduction occurs as electron hopping between the multivalent B-site metal ions. The total electrical conductivity of LSSM y was measured as a function of scandium doping concentration using the four-probe DC method ( Fig. 3 ). The increased electrical conductivity with increasing operating temperature verified the LSSM y oxides\u2019 putative semi-conductor properties. Increasing the Sc 3+ doping concentration decreased the total conductivity, especially at higher dopant concentrations. For example, LSM demonstrated an electrical conductivity of 166 S cm \u22121 at 850 \u00b0C, which was similar to the literature value [26] , but LSSM0.2 demonstrated an electrical conductivity only of \u223c46 S cm \u22121 at the same temperature. The temperature dependence of electrical conductivity was fitted to the equation \u03c3 = A 0 / T exp(\u2212 E a / kT ), where \u03c3 is the electrical conductivity (S cm \u22121 ), T is the temperature (K), E a is the activation energy (J), k is the Boltzmann constant (J K \u22121 ), and A 0 is the pre-exponential factor (S K cm \u22121 ). The activation energies of electron transport for the various LSSM y oxides were 12.69 \u00b1 0.02, 13.34 \u00b1 0.11, 18.48 \u00b1 0.03, and 19.48 \u00b1 0.06 kJ mol \u22121 for y values of 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The electrical conductivity measured by four-probe DC method is a sum of electronic and oxygen ionic conductivity. We have tried to obtain the oxygen ionic conductivity of LSSM y by the oxygen permeation measurement of LSSM y membrane. Within the experimental errors, the oxygen permeation flux through LSSM y membranes between 600 and 900 \u00b0C is negligible, suggesting the Sc 3+ doping did not introduce oxygen ionic conductivity into the oxide under zero current polarization. Therefore, the measured electrical conductivity represents the electronic conductivity. For the perovskite oxide, the electronic conductivity is closely related with its phase structure and the characteristics of the variable metal ion(s) at the B-site. Since the same phase structure was observed for all LSSM y oxides with varied Sc 3+ doping amounts, the effect of lattice structure on the electrical conductivity can be reasonably assumed to be negligible. The electron conduction in perovskite is created by B-site lattice cations through strongly overlapping B\u2013O\u2013B bonds with a mechanism like the Zerner double exchange process shown below: B n + \u2013O 2\u2212 \u2013B ( n +1)+ \u21d2 B ( n +1)+ \u2013O \u2212 \u2013B ( n +1)+ \u21d2 B ( n +1)+ \u2013O 2\u2212 \u2013B n + Due to the constant valence state of Sc 3+ , it is impossible for electron conduction through the overlapping of 2p of oxygen with the 3d orbital of Sc 3+ . Therefore, Sc 3+ acted as a block for electron conduction. This explains the decrease in electrical conductivity with the increase of Sc 3+ doping level and the increase of activation energy for electrical conduction. Interestingly, the activation energy increased greatly from y = 0.05 to 0.1, but only slightly from y = 0.0 to 0.05. Thus, the blocking effect was significant only for oxides with y \u2265 0.1. In fuel cell applications, over-doping with Sc 3+ may introduce current collecting problems stemming from low electrical conductivity. A smaller Sc 3+ doping concentration was preferred for this reason. 3.2 Electrochemical performance of LSSM y without DC polarization The EIS of freshly prepared LSSM y ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) electrodes that had not been activated with DC treatment were acquired ( Fig. 4 ). All measured values were too large for these materials to be appropriate cathode materials. This suggested that Sc 3+ doping did not facilitate ionic conduction into the bulk oxide in the absence of direct current polarization treatments, agreeing well with the oxygen permeation measurement of corresponding dense membranes. In other words, the oxygen reduction reaction occurred primarily at the TPB. A modest reduction in the area-specific polarization resistance relative to that of LSM was nevertheless observed for the LSSM0.05 oxide, and this suggested that Sc 3+ doping may promote surface oxygen reduction chemistry. Oxygen reduction over SOFC cathode proceeds via a complex mechanism, which involves the gaseous diffusion of molecular oxygen to the electrode, the adsorption of oxygen onto the electrode surface, the atomic dissociation of dioxygen, the migration of dissociated, adsorbed oxygen intermediates/ions to the reduction zone, charge transfer, and the incorporation of oxide ions into the electrolyte lattice at the TPB. The diffusion of oxygen species along the electrode surface to the electrode/electrolyte interface normally occurs at low frequency and is frequently the rate-limiting step. In addition, there is significant evidence of strontium enrichment on the La x Sr 1\u2212 x MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and La x Sr 1\u2212 x Co y Fe 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 electrode surfaces in air from XPS and neutron powder diffraction experiments [28\u201330] . Since SrO is an insulator, its presence blocks the oxygen diffusion pathway and inhibits surface diffusion. The effect of the Sc 3+ doping concentration on surface SrO enrichment was investigated with pH measurements. About 0.002 mol LSSM y ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) powder was boiled in 0.2 l de-ionized water for 2 h to dissolve the SrO before it was cooled to \u223c30 \u00b0C. The solution's pH was then measured with a digital pH meter. The oxide solutions\u2019 pH values were measured at 9.0, 8.7, 8.6, and 8.3 for y values of 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. Because SrO is basic, a higher pH value indicates a higher concentration of SrO in solution that, in turn, corresponds to a higher surface concentration on the LSSM y oxide. The observed decrease in solution pH with increasing Sc 3+ concentration implied that doping suppressed SrO generation, and this may have accounted for the superior electrochemical performance of LSSM0.05 relative to that of LSM. Oxygen reduction, however, was also closely related to the surface concentration of oxygen vacancies, and this value depended on the concentration of surface Mn 4+ . Previous research has demonstrated that the average oxidation state of manganese was higher on the oxide surface than in the bulk [29] . H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was applied to measure the Mn 4+ surface concentration of the LSSM y oxides ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) ( Fig. 5 ). The shoulder peak near 400 \u00b0C was attributed to the reduction of surface Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ , and the peaks at 500 and 800 \u00b0C were ascribed to the reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ and Mn 3+ to Mn 2+ , respectively, in the oxide bulk. The Sc 3+ dopant generally suppressed surface Mn 4+ . There was almost no reduction peak corresponding to surface Mn 4+ reduction in the spectrum of the y = 0.2 oxide. The decreased Mn 4+ surface concentration increased the surface oxygen vacancy concentration. An optimal concentration of vacancies should improve the material's electrochemical performance because these vacancies are essential to the oxygen reduction and migration processes. This may also explain the superior electrode performance of LSSM0.05 in the absence of DC polarization treatment. Because Sc 3+ ions are much larger than both Mn 4+ and Mn 3+ , excessive Sc 3+ dopant in oxide B-sites may create trapping centers for anion vacancies and thus may deteriorate the material's oxygen conductivity. Sc 3+ doping in excess of y = 0.05 therefore increased the polarization resistance of LSSM y oxides. 3.3 LSSM y electrode performance after current polarization It has been established that treatment of an LSM electrode with DC can minimize polarization losses [31\u201333] . The cathodic overpotential (IR corrected) of LSSM y electrodes was measured as a function of time at a polarization current density of 400 mA cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 ). The initial overpotentials were 0.430, 0.209, 0.205, and 0.225 V for LSSM y oxides with y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. LSM had a much larger initial overpotential than all LSSM y oxides ( y > 0.0). This result agreed well with the high SrO and Mn 4+ surface concentrations of LSM that were observed in our previous experiments. The larger initial overpotential of LSSM0.2 compared to LSSM0.05 or LSSM0.1 was attributed to the Sc 3+ trapping effect, which immobilized the surface oxygen vacancies. All samples experienced a sharp decrease in overpotential after the first several minutes of polarization, and this corresponded to the successful creation of oxygen vacancies and the dissolution of surface SrO into the electrode bulk. The elimination of SrO via DC treatment was previously demonstrated [32,33] . The SrO-free surface allowed faster surface exchange kinetics, which contributed in part to the enhanced electrode performance. The formation of oxygen vacancies in the bulk allowed the reduction of oxygen to occur at the electrode-gas dual-phase boundary (DPB) and allowed charge transfer to occur over the whole electrolyte\u2013electrode dual-phase interface. This also had the effect of enhancing electrode performance. The oxides\u2019 steady-state overpotentials during treatment with 400 mA cm \u22122 polarization current were ranked as follows: LSM (0.185 V) > LSM0.2 (0.151 V) > LSM0.1 (0.132 V) > LSM0.05 (0.120 V). Under current polarization conditions, LSSM0.05 showed the best performance, and the overall trend among the oxides was the same as that without current polarization ( Fig. 4 ). The drop in overpotential from initial value to steady-state was 0.244, 0.089, 0.073, and 0.074 V for LSSM y with y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. The decrease in voltage drop observed for increasing Sc 3+ doping concentration was attributed to the effect of Sc 3+ on suppressing variations in the bulk (i.e., oxygen vacancies) and surface properties (i.e. SrO accumulation). The EIS of all LSSM y oxides ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) were obtained at 800 and 850 \u00b0C with current polarization (400 mA cm \u22122 ) measured 30 min after the onset of DC application ( Fig. 7 ). For all samples, the electrode polarization resistance decreased considerably under current polarization conditions, and LSSM0.05 showed the lowest area-specific polarization resistance (\u223c0.094 \u03a9 cm 2 ) at 850 \u00b0C. At the same temperature, the corresponding value for LSM was \u223c0.25 \u03a9 cm 2 . Increasing Sc 3+ doping concentration such that y \u2265 0.05, however, resulted in a rebound of polarization resistance. This reversal was attributed to defect association between Sc 3+ and the oxygen vacancies in the LSSM y bulk because higher doping concentrations should have increased the significance of these defect associations. The LSSM0.2 oxide demonstrated both higher and lower area-specific polarization resistance values than LSM at 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. The dependence of overpotential on polarization current density varied with Sc 3+ doping concentration ( Fig. 8 ). At 850 \u00b0C, the LSSM y overpotentials were ranked as follows: LSSM0.05 < LSSM0.1 < LSSM0.2 < LSM. At 800 \u00b0C, the ranking was the same, except the overpotential of LSSM0.2 was larger than that of LSM. These observations coincided with the previous impedance measurements. We noticed during the overpotential measurements that the cathodes\u2019 polarization resistances were somewhat larger than those obtained during impedance measurements. This suggested that there was interfacial resistance between the current collector and the cathode layer, because current collection efficiency was insufficient. Similar phenomena were also observed by Jiang et al. [34] . Regardless, it was evident that cathode performance was significantly improved by slight Sc 3+ doping. 3.4 Single-cell performance Anode-supported fuel cells containing ScSZ thin-film electrolyte were fabricated to test the performance of LSSM y oxides as cathode materials under typical SOFC operating conditions. Fuel cell performance is closely related not only to electrode composition, but also to electrode microstructure. To ensure a reasonable comparison of the different materials, our fabrication techniques were rigorously optimized to minimize any variations in the microstructures of both the electrodes and the electrolyte. Dual dry-pressing, which is an elegant, reproducible, and simple technique, was used to fabricate anode-supported thin-film SOFCs. A typical cell's cross-section was imaged via SEM revealing an ScSZ + Ni supported thin-film ScSZ electrolyte roughly 30 \u03bcm thick and an LSSM y cathode 30\u201340 \u03bcm thick ( Fig. 9 ). In addition, the fuel cell cathodes all adhered nicely to their respective electrolyte layers, thereby lowering the polarization resistance of their interfaces. Fuel cell performance was assessed via the I \u2013 V polarization method. The cathode atmosphere was ambient air, and H 2 fuel was flowed over the anode at a rate of 80 ml min \u22121 (STP). The cells\u2019 current\u2013voltage characteristics and power densities were measured at different temperatures ( Fig. 10 ). The open-circuit voltages (OCVs) for wet H 2 were close to the values predicted by the Nernst equation, suggesting efficient cell sealing. The maximum power densities of the fuel cell equipped with an LSM cathode were \u223c450, \u223c200, and \u223c80 mW cm \u22122 at 850, 750, and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. The respective values for the cell equipped with an LSSM0.05 cathode were \u223c1300, \u223c650, and \u223c200 mW cm \u22122 . Because fabrication techniques were rigorously controlled to minimize confounding variables, it was assumed that the observed differences in fuel cell performance were attributable solely to the activity of the cathode. Thus, it was concluded that doping a small concentration of Sc 3+ into LSM increased overall fuel cell performance. The various fuel cells\u2019 area-specific electrode polarization resistances were measured under OCV conditions ( Fig. 11 ). The reported electrochemical impedance was a combination of anode and cathode polarization resistances. Total polarization resistance decreased significantly for the y = 0.05 oxide. Assuming the anode polarization resistance was identical among all cells, Sc 3+ doping ( y = 0.05, 0.1) improved cathode performance. The best performance was achieved at a concentration between y = 0.05 to 0.1, which agreed with our previous three-electrode electrochemical polarization tests. 4 Conclusions Doping Sc 3+ into the B-site of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 formed new perovskites with the empirical formula La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc y Mn 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 . The oxides in which y = 0.0\u20130.2 had the same orthorhombic symmetry as the parent oxide. Introduction of Sc 2 O 3 into the oxides led to decreased thermal expansion and electrical conductivity, but La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.05 Mn 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides still maintained acceptable electrical conductivity. Doping with Sc 3+ also suppressed surface SrO accumulation, and this suppression facilitated oxygen surface diffusion. Among the various La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc y Mn 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides with different Sc 3+ doping concentration examined, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.05 Mn 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 demonstrated the smallest area-specific polarization resistance and the lowest overpotential both with and without DC polarization treatment. Over-doping with Sc 3+ , however, increased polarization resistance because the mismatch in ionic radius size between Sc 3+ and Mn 3+/4+ induced defect association between Sc 3+ and oxygen vacancies. The optimal Sc 3+ doping concentration was found to be y = 0.05. At 750 \u00b0C, the fuel cell equipped with a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.05 Mn 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode delivered a peak power density of \u223c650 mW cm \u22122 , which was more than twice that of its counterpart cell equipped with a LSM cathode (\u223c200 mW cm \u22122 ). These results suggested that La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.05 Mn 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 has great potential for application as a cathode material in IT-SOFCs containing stabilized zirconia electrolyte. A composite cathode formed by mixing La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.05 Mn 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 with electrolytic materials, such as YSZ or ScSZ, may increase the cathode even performance.

The methane conversion and the hydrogen content in the effluent gas reached 71 and 83%, respectively, at an operating temperature of 700 \u00b0C under ambient pressure. I \u2013 V tests demonstrated that the methane is inert to the electro-catalyst and acts mainly as a diluting gas. A porous Al 2 O 3 -supported thin-film Pd membrane was integrated with the catalytic methane decomposition process. Due to the high initial hydrogen content, even an imperfect Pd membrane, effectively increased the hydrogen content to >98%, which resulted in only a slight performance loss of \u223c10% compared to the application of pure hydrogen as the fuel. The advantages, such as continuous hydrogen separation, simple process, high reliability and value-added by-product, all make this process highly attractive for future PEMFC application.

        "abstract": "Different concentrations of copper are added to LiLaNi-Al 2O 3 to improve the electronic conductivity property for application as the materials of the anode catalyst layer for solid oxide fuel cells operating on methane. Their catalytic activity for the methane partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming reactions at 600-850 \u00b0C is systematically investigated. Among the three catalysts, the LiLaNi-Al 2O 3/Cu (50:50, by weight) catalyst presents the best catalytic activity. Thus, the catalytic stability, carbon deposition and surface conductivity of the LiLaNi-Al 2O 3/Cu catalyst are further studied in detail. O 2-TPO results indicate that the coking resistance of LiLaNi-Al 2O 3/Cu is satisfactory and comparable to that of LiLaNi-Al 2O 3. The surface conductivity tests demonstrate it is extremely improved for LiLaNi-Al 2O 3 catalyst due to the addition of 50 wt.% copper. A cell with LiLaNi-Al 2O 3/Cu (50:50) catalyst layer is operated on mixtures of methane-O 2, methane-H 2O and methane-CO 2, and peak power densities of 1081, 1036 and 988 mW cm -2 are obtained at 850 \u00b0C, respectively, comparable to the cell with LiLaNi-Al 2O 3 catalyst layer. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that LiLaNi-Al 2O 3/Cu (50:50) catalysts are highly coking resistant and conductive catalyst layers for solid oxide fuel cells. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "title": "Electrochemical performance of silver-modified Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-\u03b4 cathodes prepared via electroless deposition",
        "abstract": "Silver-modified Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) were prepared by an electroless deposition process using N 2 H 4 as the reducing agent at room temperature. This fabrication technique together with tailored electrode porosity, modified the BSCF electrodes with silver content that varied from 0.3 to 30 wt.% without damaging the electrode microstructure. Both the Ag loading and firing temperatures were found to have a significant impact on the electrode performance, which could facilitate or block the electrochemical processes of the BSCF-based cathodes, processes that include charge-transfer, oxygen adsorption and oxygen electrochemical reduction. At an optimal Ag loading of 3.0 wt.% and firing temperature of 850 \u00b0C, an area specific resistance of only 0.042 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C was achieved for a modified BSCF cathode. Keywords Perovskite Cathode ac impedance Oxygen reduction reaction Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) 1 Introduction The development of high performance cathodes is critical for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), which have received considerable attention recently due to their many advantages over their high-temperature counterparts. These advantages include decreased cell degradation, more flexible fuel cell materials, reduced materials and fabrication cost and increased system reliability [1\u20135] . One method to improve the cathode performance at reduced-temperatures is to modify the oxide electrode with noble metals [6\u201315] . It was reported that Pd-promoted La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF) demonstrated 3\u20135 times lower cathode impedance than the pure LSCF under the similar operating conditions between 400 and 750 \u00b0C [9] . Considering the high price of noble metals such as Ru, Rh, Pt and Pd, silver has gained notable attention. Several researchers have reported improved cathode performance through the introduction of silver as a functional component in SOFC cathodes [13\u201315] . An area specific resistance (ASR) as low as 1.25 \u03a9 cm 2 was reported at 500 \u00b0C for a Ag + Zr(Sc)O 2 cermet cathode [13] . Wang and Barnett [14] observed that the introduction of silver to the La 0.7 Sr 0.3 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathodes resulted in significant improvement not only in electronic conductivity but also in electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction. Similar improvement was also observed for the LSCF + SDC composite cathode by Zhang et al. [15] . These results claimed that the peak power density increased from 173.8 to 605.3 mW cm \u22122 at 750 \u00b0C by the addition of 30 wt.% Ag into the LSCF + SDC cathode based on anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cells. Akimune et al. [16] demonstrated that nano-Ag had higher electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction than Pt-based catalyst in a yttria-doped BaCeO 3 protonic conductor. More recently, Wang et al. [17] illustrated via computer simulation that the rapid oxygen adsorption and desorption occurred at the silver surface and at the three-phase boundaries of the SOFC cathode of Ag + CeO 2 . Another method for decreasing cathode polarization resistance at intermediate temperatures is to apply mixed conducting oxides as electrode materials since they can significantly extend the length of the three-phase boundary where the oxygen reduction reactions take place [18\u201322] . Shao et al. are the first to report the application of mixed conducting Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) oxide as a potential cathode for IT-SOFCs operating at \u2264600 \u00b0C [18,19] . BSCF has relatively poor electronic conductivity. It is expected that modifying the BSCF cathode with silver would result in an increase in electronic conductivity of the electrode. On the other hand, the high activity of silver for oxygen reduction may be additional benefit as an additive to oxide cathode. Therefore, silver modification may be a practical way to improve the electrode performance of BSCF. On the other hand, the preparation technique and the silver content both could have significant effect on the cathode performance [23,24] . The two most applied methods for the preparation of noble metal promoted oxide cathodes include mixing cathode oxide powders with noble metal powders prior to cathode sintering (method A), and secondly the impregnation of sintered oxide cathode with precursor solutions (method B). Due to the low melting point of silver (961 \u00b0C), a sintering temperature of <920 \u00b0C is usually applied [13,23\u201325] . Such a low sintering temperature, however, could result in poor connection between cathode particles and bad adhesion of the cathode to the electrolyte surface. Consequently, high interfacial resistances may be observed for the electrode prepared by method A. On the other hand, the loading capacity of Ag by the typical impregnation-thermal reduction process was found to be \u22643.0 wt.% [24] . Another drawback of method B is that the thermal decomposition of the Ag-contained precursor at elevated temperatures could damage the cathode's functional layer through severe pore formation [26] . This paper reports the application of a novel impregnation-N 2 H 4 reduction process for incorporating silver into the porous BSCF. This technique together with tailored cathode porosity, allows for the preparation of modified BSCF electrodes with silver content varying from 0.3 to 30 wt.% without damage to the electrode microstructure. It was observed that the firing temperature and the amount of silver added significantly affected cathode performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of powders BSCF powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. The detailed procedure for this process may be seen in a prior publication Ref. [27] . Required amounts of metal nitrates were prepared into a mixed solution followed by the addition of EDTA and citric acid at pH value of \u223c6 with the help of NH 4 OH. The mole ratio of total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid was set at 1:1:2. The evaporation of water at 90 \u00b0C resulted in transparent gels, which were first pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and then further calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to produce the final products. 2.2 Symmetric cell fabrications The as-prepared BSCF powders were dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension through the use of a high-energy ball miller (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6) at the rotational speed of 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The suspension was symmetrically painted on both surfaces of a dense SDC pellet with a diameter of \u223c13 mm and a thickness of \u223c0.8 mm. The whole cell was then calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. 2.3 Impregnation of silver For modifying the BSCF cathode with silver, an electroless technique was applied. AgNO 3 solution (0.01 mol L \u22121 for the preparation of BSCF-3Ag and BSCF-30Ag; 0.001 mol L \u22121 for the preparation of BSCF-0.3Ag) was dropped (by a suction pipette with an accuracy of \u00b10.01 mL) and soaked into the porous BSCF cathode layer, and then heated to evaporate the water. Silver loading was controlled through the volume of the drops. When the desired silver loading was reached, necessary amount of N 2 H 4 solution (0.01 or 0.001 mol L \u22121 ) was introduced as the reducing agent to initiate the Ag reduction reaction. Once the reaction was completed, the cells were heated at 80 \u00b0C over a hotplate to evaporate the water from the electrode layer. Finally, the cells were calcined at high temperatures to stabilize the silver within the porous electrode. Three kinds of electrodes were prepared, in which the weight percentage of Ag to BSCF oxide was 0.3, 3.0 and 30 wt.%, and they were noted as BSCF-0.3Ag, BSCF-3Ag and BSCF-30Ag, respectively. 2.4 Characterization A symmetrical cell with the configuration of electrode|SDC|electrode was characterized in a mixture of N 2 (99.999%) and O 2 (99.99%) with a total flow rate of 100 mL min \u22121 for the impedance studies. In the tests, the surfaces of the electrodes were coated with a thin layer of silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai Research Institute of Synthetic Resins) as the current collector. ac impedance measurements were carried out under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions using an electrochemical workstation based on a 1260A frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency range applied was from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with signal amplitude of 10 mV. The overall impedance data were fitted by a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program in ZView 2.9 software. In order to minimize the systematic error, the same symmetrical cell was applied for testing the effect of firing temperatures on the cathode performance. For the investigation of firing temperature on the cathode performance (700\u2013850 \u00b0C), the as-prepared cell painted with Ag paste was first fired at 700 \u00b0C for 30 min and then tested from 700 to 550 \u00b0C at an interval of 50 \u00b0C; the same cell was then fast heated from 550 to 800 \u00b0C within 20 min and then dwelled for 30 min for the next tests ranging from 700 to 550 \u00b0C. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) was used to analyze the phase structure of cathode. The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). Meanwhile, the composition of the cathode material was also analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). 3 Results 3.1 Preparation and characterization of silver-modified BSCF cathodes Since the firing temperature of the oxide electrode layer could also have significant effect on the electrode performance, a fixed temperature of 1000 \u00b0C was applied for firing the BSCF onto the SDC surface throughout this investigation. The morphologies of the as-obtained BSCF-SDC dual layer are shown in Fig. 1 a and b . The BSCF layer has a thickness of 18\u201325 \u03bcm and a porosity of \u223c35% as measured by the Archimedes method. After the impregnation of the electrodes with AgNO 3 , N 2 H 4 solution was applied to reduce Ag + to Ag at room temperature via the reaction 2AgNO 3 + 3N 2 H 4 \u2192 2Ag + 6H 2 O + 4N 2 . Table 1 shows the Ag loading and the porosity of the electrodes after silver modification. The silver content reached as high as 30 wt.% of BSCF while the porosity was reduced to \u223c22.0%. Fig. 1 c and d shows the morphologies of the cross-section and surface of the as-prepared 30 wt.% silver-modified BSCF (BSCF-30Ag) cathode, respectively. The leaf-like particles, verified as Ag by EDX, dispersed uniformly over the BSCF surface. As shown in Fig. 1 a and b, the BSCF particles connected with each other and adhered to the electrolyte surface as firmly in the sliver-modified BSCF as in the fresh BSCF cathode before the impregnation. Haanappel et al. found that the thermal decomposition of AgNO 3 during the sintering of Ag impregnated cathode, resulted in damage to the cathode's functional layer by severe pore formation [26] . The reduction rate of AgNO 3 can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of N 2 H 4 in the current technique and also allows for the minimized destruction of the BSCF network during the deposition of silver. For cathode performance evaluation, Ag paste was painted over the cathode layer and fired at high temperatures to eliminate the organic substances and to function as the current collector. Before examining the performance of silver-modified BSCF cathode, the effect of the silver collector on the BSCF cathode performance needs to be evaluated. Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependences of R P for the BSCF cathode with Ag current collector fired at various temperatures, where R P is the overall polarization resistance of the electrode. The activity of the electrodes was very similar at firing temperatures lower than 900 \u00b0C. For example, the polarization resistances of the electrodes were 0.099, 0.097 and 0.097 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C for electrodes at a firing temperature of 700, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Almost the same activation energies (116 \u00b1 1 kJ mol \u22121 ) for the oxygen reduction reaction were also observed. These results indicate that the utilizing silver as a current collector did not change the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanism of the BSCF cathode at a firing temperature lower than 900 \u00b0C. However, the polarization resistance and the activation energy at 600 \u00b0C decreased to 0.072 \u03a9 cm 2 and 104 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively, at the firing temperature of 900 \u00b0C. Considering the BSCF cathode layer was fired to an electrolyte surface at temperature of 1000 \u00b0C, the additional firing temperature of 900 \u00b0C should have negligible effect on the microstructure of the electrode. The enhanced cathode performance at the firing temperature of 900 \u00b0C was then attributed to the silver. Silver was known to improve the electro-catalytic properties for the ORR [8] , and thus both the resistance and activation energy may be reduced significantly by the introduction of Ag [13] . It is believed that the silver potentially migrates from the current collector layer to the BSCF surface during the high-temperature firing. Therefore, firing temperatures of 700\u2013850 \u00b0C were applied for the fabrication of the silver-modified BSCF to avoid the contribution of the silver current collector in the enhancement of the cathode performance. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the BSCF-3Ag cathode fired at various temperatures together with the as-prepared one for comparison. The crystalline size of silver is also calculated based on the Scherrer equation and the results are also shown in Fig. 3 . All of the diffraction peaks in the as-prepared BSCF-3Ag cathode can be indexed well based on the cubic perovskite phase of BSCF. No Ag or AgO phases were detected. This suggests that the Ag was very fine in nature and was also dispersed uniformly over the surfaces of the BSCF grains. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Ag started to appear when the firing temperature was elevated to 700 \u00b0C or higher. The relative intensity of the diffraction peaks for silver to BSCF decreased with the firing temperatures, while the crystalline size of silver increased with the firing temperatures, suggesting that the fine Ag grains were sintered to coarse particles and that the BSCF surface that was covered by Ag was re-exposed to air. Fig. 4 (a)\u2013(c) shows the SEM images of silver-modified BSCF cathodes with various Ag loadings after being fired at 800 \u00b0C. No Ag grains could be observed when the Ag loading was 0.3 wt.%. However, EDX did detect the silver phase. While the leaf-like Ag particles grew into round particles with a uniform dispersion on the BSCF surface for BSCF-30Ag cathode after being fired at 800 \u00b0C, a reduced porosity was also visible when compared with the BSCF-0.3Ag and BSCF-3Ag cathodes from SEM. The firing temperature was also found to have a significant effect on the Ag dispersion morphologies over the BSCF surface. Fig. 4 (d)\u2013(f) shows the SEM photos of the BSCF-30Ag cathodes fired at different temperatures. Very fine Ag particles dispersed uniformly on and covered the BSCF surface completely after firing at 700 \u00b0C. When the firing temperature increased to 800 \u00b0C, some coarse particles with round shape appeared which proved to be the sintered silvers. However, the majority of the BSCF surface was still covered by fine Ag particles. When the firing temperature was elevated to 850 \u00b0C, the Ag particles became coarser and some of the BSCF surfaces were re-exposed to air. Since the silver coverage of the BSCF is closely related with the oxygen adsorption and also the electronic conduction of the cathode, a significant impact by the firing temperature on the cathode performance may be expected. Additionally, it is worthy of noting that the silver is unlikely incorporate into the BSCF lattice or vaporize to the atmosphere due to the relatively low firing temperature (<850 \u00b0C) as well as the short firing time (30 min). Furthermore, Simner et al. [7] found that the silver-modified Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 cathode was tested over almost 2000 h at 650 \u00b0C with no degradation was detected. The continued migration of the silver could be observed only at an operating temperature >700 \u00b0C. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the silver itself in BSCF-Ag cathode is very stable at the operating temperature <650 \u00b0C. In this study, the symmetrical cell was tested in highly pure N 2 (99.999%)\u2013O 2 (99.99%) mixture to eliminate the negative influence from CO 2 or vapor. The cell worked for about 1200 min with no obvious degradation. The further study about the long-term stability of BSCF-Ag cathode in the atmosphere is on-going in our laboratory. 3.2 Impedance analyses for sliver-modified BSCF electrode 3.2.1 Influence of Ag loading Fig. 5 shows the ac impedance spectra at 650 \u00b0C in air of the pure BSCF and the silver-modified BSCF cathodes with various Ag loadings fired from 700, 800 and 850 \u00b0C. The difference between the real axes intercepts of the impedance plot is considered to be the electrode polarization resistance ( R p ). For the three silver-modified BSCF cathodes, BSCF-3Ag showed the lowest polarization resistances at all corresponding firing temperatures. The R p of BSCF-3Ag fired at 700 \u00b0C was 0.047 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 \u00b0C which was higher than that of BSCF (\u223c0.040 \u03a9 cm 2 ), but much lower than those of BSCF-0.3Ag (\u223c0.068 \u03a9 cm 2 ) and BSCF-30Ag (\u223c0.073 \u03a9 cm 2 ). The differences in R p values between the three silver-modified cathodes were reduced when the firing temperature increased to 850 \u00b0C. For example, the polarization resistances at 650 \u00b0C for BSCF-0.3Ag, BSCF-3Ag and BSCF-30Ag were 0.027, 0.023 and 0.029 \u03a9 cm 2 , respectively, which are only about 60\u201370% of the R p of the pure BSCF (0.039 \u03a9 cm 2 ) at the identical conditions. For all the cathodes with varied silver content, the impedance spectra could be separated into two arcs. This suggests that the oxygen reduction reaction over the electrodes could be composed of at least two different processes. The impedance spectra were evaluated by fitting the impedance spectra to an equivalent circuit with a configuration of LR ohm ( R E1 \u2212 CPE 1 )( R E2 \u2212 CPE 2 ), where R ohm is the overall ohmic resistance including the electrolyte resistance, the electrode ohmic resistance and the lead resistance; L is the inductance which could be due to the Ag current/voltage probes or the high frequency phase shift of the electrochemical equipment; CPE is a constant phase element. The resistance at the high frequency is probably associated with charge-transfer processes ( R E1 ), which include the electron-transfer and ion-transfer processes occurring at the current collector/electrode and the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, respectively. The low frequency arc can be attributed to the diffusion processes ( R E2 ), which include adsorption\u2013desorption of oxygen, oxygen diffusion at the gas-cathode surface interface and surface diffusion of intermediate oxygen species [28\u201331] . R E1 of the BSCF and silver-modified BSCF cathodes fired from 850 \u00b0C as a function of oxygen partial pressure at 600 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 A . It was observed that R E1 had a p O 2 dependent slope of 1/4 for BSCF and BSCF-0.3Ag cathodes at 600 \u00b0C. The process with a p O 2 dependency of 1/4 could be related to the oxygen reduction reaction accompanying with the electron-transfer process [32\u201334] . This indicates that the charge-transfer processes ( R E1 ) could be controlled mainly by the electron-transfer processes. The slope decreased to 0.17 at Ag loading of 3.0 wt.% and re-increased to 0.21 at 30 wt.%. The decrease of the slope suggests that the rate-limiting for oxygen reduction by the electron-transfer process was weakened by introducing 3.0 wt.% Ag into the cathode. However, further increase of Ag content to 30 wt.% increased the charge-transfer resistance. The R E2 of BSCF and 850 \u00b0C fired silver-modified BSCF cathodes as a function of oxygen partial pressure at 600 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 B. The process with a p O 2 dependency of 1/2 could be related to the surface diffusion of oxygen atoms [32,35] or the adsorption of molecular oxygen [32,34] , while the process with a p O 2 dependency of 1 could be related to the gas diffusion of molecular oxygen [36] . As can be seen, with increasing the Ag loading, the slope increased slightly. However, the slope reached only 0.54 even at the high Ag loading of 30 wt.%. This indicates that the introduction of silver indeed had a negligible effect on the gas diffusion process in this study. The temperature dependences of R E1 and R E2 of pure BSCF and silver-modified BSCF cathode fired from 850 \u00b0C as a function of Ag loading are shown in Fig. 7 , respectively. The R E2 of the silver-modified BSCF cathodes were much lower than that of the pure BSCF, which suggested that the diffusion process was significantly improved by the modification of silver. For the reactions over BSCF-0.3Ag cathode, R E1 was much larger than R E2 , which indicates that the dominant electrode process was associated with the charge-transfer processes. When the silver loading increased to 3.0 wt.%, R E1 began to be lower than R E2 . This suggested that the dominant electrode process had been shifted from the charge-transfer processes to the diffusion processes. With increasing the Ag loading further, R E2 decreased. However, the charge-transfer resistances ( R E1 ) increased with the Ag loading and reached even higher values than that of the BSCF-0.3Ag or the pure BSCF. This suggests that the excessive Ag loading can promote the diffusion process but hinder the charge-transfer process. 3.2.2 Influence of firing temperature Fig. 8 shows the ac impedance spectra of silver-modified BSCF cathodes at 600 \u00b0C in air fired from various temperatures. It was observed that the firing temperature had a very pronounced impact on the cathode performance. For example, the polarization resistance ( R p ) for the BSCF-3Ag cathode fired from 700 \u00b0C was 0.102 \u03a9 cm 2 , while it was only 0.042 \u03a9 cm 2 for the one fired from 850 \u00b0C. The more evident decrease was observed for the BSCF-30Ag cathode. The corresponding R p was 0.198 and 0.066 \u03a9 cm 2 , with a decreasing proportion of 66.7%. For silver-modified BSCF cathodes fired from 700 and 800 \u00b0C, the low frequency arc was larger than the high frequency arc. This indicates that the diffusion processes limited the electrode reaction at lower firing temperatures. With increasing the firing temperature, the sizes of the low frequency arc reduced dramatically. The effect of firing temperature on R E1 and R E2 of the BSCF-3Ag cathode is shown in Fig. 9 . Both the charge-transfer and oxygen diffusion resistances decreased with increasing the firing temperature. In all cases, R E2 was higher than R E1 . For example, an R E1 value of 0.018 \u03a9 cm 2 was noted for cathode fired from 850 \u00b0C which was about 55% lower than 0.041 \u03a9 cm 2 , which resulted from firing at 700 \u00b0C. The R E2 was reduced from 0.065 to 0.024 \u03a9 cm 2 with a reducing proportion of about 63%. This suggests that the diffusion processes were more sensitive to the firing temperature. 3.3 ORR activation energies for silver-modified BSCF cathodes The Arrhenius plots were drawn for the R P , R E1 and R E2 as a function of Ag loading and firing temperatures. The apparent activation energies ( E a s) of the ORR obtained from the slope of the plot are listed in Table 2 . In this study, three nominally identical prepared samples were measured to check the reproducibility of the electrode performance and the relative standard deviation was below 10%. Among the sliver-modified BSCF cathode with varied silver contents, BSCF-3Ag cathode showed the lowest activation energies for R P , R E1 and R E2 at the same firing temperature. It was only 80 kJ mol \u22121 for the BSCF-3Ag cathode (850 \u00b0C fired) while 116 kJ mol \u22121 for a pure BSCF cathode. Since the cathode with small activation energy for oxygen reduction is desirable for reduced-temperature SOFCs [12] , BSCF-3Ag is a highly promising cathode for IT-SOFCs. The 30 wt.% Ag might be over-loaded, resulting in not enough exposed BSCF surface being present for the charge-transfer process. Thus higher activation energy ( R E1 ) was observed for BSCF-30Ag cathode than for BSCF-0.3Ag and BSCF-3Ag cathodes. The diffusion resistance ( R E2 ) may contribute from the adsorption of O 2 and the electrochemical reduction and transfer of oxygen species at the gas-cathode surface interface [37] . The increase of Ag loading can extend the surface area for oxygen adsorption; however, it may also cover the active sites of BSCF, which are needed for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen. 30 wt.% Ag loading excessively reduced the active sites of BSCF, which led to a higher activation energy for its diffusion process. Different silver loading resulted in significant different kinetic properties of ORR over silver-modified BSCF cathodes as a function of firing temperatures. For a Ag loading of 0.3 wt.%, the activation energies for R E2 were very similar for cathodes fired at various temperatures. The decrease of the activation energies for R P was attributed to the decrease of activation energies for R E1 . This indicates that low Ag loading can only improve the charge-transfer process. However, when Ag loading increased to 3.0\u201330 wt.%, the activation energies for R P , R E1 and R E2 decreased as the firing temperatures increased. The higher activation energy for R P (124 kJ mol \u22121 ) was observed at the firing temperature of 700 \u00b0C, due to the occupation of the active sites for oxygen reduction reaction by the uniformly dispersed fine Ag particles as shown in Fig. 4 d. With increasing the firing temperature, the fine Ag particles melted and grew into the coarse Ag particles, and the active sites were re-exposed to air as shown in Fig. 4 f. Therefore, both the R E1 and R E2 decreased with increasing the firing temperatures. 4 Discussion Based on above results, the following reaction mechanism for oxygen reduction over the silver-modified BSCF cathodes was proposed: (a) Diffusion of O 2 (gas) in gas phase through porous layer (1) (b) Dissociative adsorption of O 2 to form O ad on the silver-modified BSCF cathode: (2)O 2 (gas) \u2192 2O ad (BSCF) (2\u2032)O 2 (gas) \u2192 2O ad (Ag) (2\u2033)O 2 (gas) \u2192 2O ad (BSCF/Ag) (c) Surface diffusion of O ad to the effective reaction zone (ERZ): (3)O ad (BSCF) \u2192 O ad (ERZ) (3\u2032)O ad (Ag) \u2192 O ad (ERZ) (3\u2033)O ad (BSCF/Ag) \u2192 O ad (ERZ) (d) Charge-transfer at ERZ: (4)O ad (ERZ) + V o (BSCF) + 2e \u2212 \u2192 O 2\u2212 (BSCF) (e) Ionic transfer of O 2\u2212 from BSCF into SDC: (5)O 2\u2212 (BSCF) \u2192 O 2\u2212 (SDC) where O ad stands for the adsorbed oxygen atom; V o is the oxygen vacancies in BSCF. Since the porosity is sufficiently high, the activation polarization resistance of step 1 can be reasonably ignored. ORR processes over silver-modified BSCF cathode are schematically shown in Fig. 10 . BSCF oxide has both a high oxygen ion bulk diffusion rate and a high oxygen surface exchange coefficient, which is related to its high oxygen vacancy concentration [38,39] . The oxygen surface exchange is the main rate-determining step for oxygen reduction reaction since the oxygen surface exchange on the BSCF cathode is relatively slow as compared with its high oxygen bulk diffusion rate [40,41] . For the pure BSCF cathode, the oxygen exchange was controlled by the adsorption of O 2 (step 2) and surface diffusion of O ad (step 3). In order to improve the cathode performance, these processes should be promoted. In this study, the silver was introduced to modify the BSCF as an effective way to improve the oxygen surface exchange on the BSCF. Based on the aforementioned results, we can see that the adsorption of O 2 is improved by using silver as a promoter because the effective zone for O 2 adsorption is extended from the pure BSCF surface (step 2) to Ag particles (step 2\u2032) or BSCF/Ag boundary (step 2\u2033) [42] . The optimal activation energy for the diffusion process (including step 2 and step 3) of BSCF-3Ag is only 86 kJ mol \u22121 , while it increases to 112 kJ mol \u22121 as the Ag loading increases to 30 wt.%. Meanwhile, the R E2 of BSCF-3Ag is the lowest compared to that of BSCF-0.3Ag and BSCF-30Ag. These suggest that the surface diffusion of O ad on Ag particles (step 3\u2032) may be slower than on pure BSCF (step 3), so the excessive Ag loading allows for the diffusion process to be controlled by the surface diffusion. In addition to higher oxygen vacancies concentration (V o ), higher electronic conduction can also lead to the faster oxygen surface exchange [43] . Oxygen chemical reduction reaction involves a charge-transfer process (step 4). Considering the relatively low electronic conductivity of BSCF oxide, the charge-transfer process of the BSCF electrode can be promoted by using silver as an additive due to the increase of electron conduction. However, some of the surface oxygen vacancies could also be covered by the Ag particles, which would reduce active sites for oxygen reduction reaction [36] . Therefore, the initial improvement in the electrochemical performance with Ag incorporation (up to \u223c3.0 wt.%) is due to the increase in the electronic conductivity and catalytic activity while adequate amount of reaction sites are maintained. However, when the silver content reached 30 wt.% of BSCF, a considerable amount of the reaction sites for the oxygen reduction process were occupied by the Ag particles which blocked the oxide ion conduction [44] consequently resulting in a decrease of electrochemical performance. The aforementioned explanation can also be supported by the fact that the performance of the silver-modified BSCF cathode increases with increasing the cathode firing temperatures. Based on XRD and SEM results, the Ag particles obtained from the reduction by N 2 H 4 can uniformly disperse on the surface of BSCF, which possess quite a number of the active sites. Ag particles can be sintered at higher temperatures, so the fine Ag grains grow to coarse ones and the active sites covered by the Ag were re-exposed to air as expected. 5 Conclusions Silver-modified BSCF cathodes for reduced-temperature SOFCs are prepared by the electroless deposition process using N 2 H 4 as the reducing agent. Via this novel technique together with tailored cathode porosity, the cathode with silver to BSCF ratio varied from 0.3 to 30 wt.% was prepared without damaging the microstructure of the cathode. Adsorption of O 2 and the charge-transfer process can be improved by using silver as a promoter because of the extended effective zone for O 2 adsorption and improved electronic conductivity. The activation energy of ORR on BSCF-3Ag is only 80 kJ mol \u22121 and the polarization resistance is as small as 0.042 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C. However, excessive Ag loading leads to the slower diffusion process and while reducing the active sites for ORR. The activation energy increases to 92 kJ mol \u22121 as the Ag loading increases to 30 wt.%. On the other hand, cathode-firing temperatures also significantly affected the performance of the silver-modified BSCF cathode complying with the same ORR mechanism. The activation energy of ORR for BSCF-30Ag fired at 700 \u00b0C is as large as 127 kJ mol \u22121 , but it decreases to 96 or 92 kJ mol \u22121 at the firing temperatures of 800 or 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Based on XRD and SEM results, the Ag particles can uniformly dispersed on the surface of BSCF, so they possess quite a number of active sites. Silver particles can be sintered at the higher temperatures, so that the fine Ag grains grow to coarse ones and the active sites of BSCF covered by the Ag were re-exposed to air as the temperature increased. These exciting results make this technique very promising for the application in reduced-temperature SOFCs.

Lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs from \u223c1000 to 400\u2013800 \u00b0C can significantly improve materials\u2019 compatibility, reduce capital costs both for materials and operation, and prolong the operational lifetime. Typical SOFCs are based on oxygen-ion-conducting electrolyte (SOFC-O 2\u2212 ) [1\u20133] . Recently, the proton-conducting SOFCs have also received considerable attention (SOFC-H + ) for reduced-temperature application [4\u201323] . Selected protonic conductors show even higher ionic conductivity than stabilized zirconia and doped ceria at <600 \u00b0C [20,24] . Furthermore, SOFC-H + have higher theoretical electromotive force (EMF) and electrical efficiency than SOFC-O 2\u2212 [25] . Although several oxides with high protonic conductivity at reduced temperature have been developed, the progress of SOFC-H + is much retarded as compared to SOFC-O 2\u2212 . Table 1 is a summary of the recent advances in the SOFC performance based on proton-conducting electrolyte in literature. Nowadays, peak power density of >1.0 W cm \u22122 at intermediate temperatures of 600\u2013800 \u00b0C is frequently reported in literature for SOFC-O 2\u2212 with thin-film electrolytes [26\u201330] , while the power density of SOFC-H + seldom exceeds 500 mW cm \u22122 [4\u201323] . In order to achieve high power density of SOFC-H + at reduced temperatures, besides the development of new electrolyte material with high protonic conductivity, the reduction of electrolyte thickness, the development of cathode with low over-potential is also of great importance. As compared to the great efforts in searching for new protonic oxides, the research on cathode for SOFC-H + is much less up to now. Uchida et al. have demonstrated that the cathodic overpotential of Pt in SOFC-H + could not be neglected below 800 \u00b0C [31] . Several authors have also exploited conducting oxides such as La 1\u2212 x Sr x MO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (M = Co, Fe, Mn) as the cathode materials for SOFC-H + [32] . Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) is a mixed conductor with ultra-high oxygen ionic conductivity, which has demonstrated to be a high-performance cathode for SOFC based on oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte [26,27,33\u201336] . In this study the application of BSCF as a cathode for proton-conducting BaCe 0.9 Y 0.1 O 2.95 (BCY) electrolyte fuel cell was reported. The fuel cell performance was found to be closely related with the phase reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte layers. By optimizing the firing temperature, the fuel cells demonstrated high power density of >500 mW cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C and high OCV of \u223c1.06 V at 500 \u00b0C. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of oxide power Both BCY and BSCF powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [37,38] . The synthesis of BCY, as an example, is described as follows. Required amounts of analytic reagents of Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , and Y(NO 3 ) 2 , according to the cation stoichiometry of the composite oxide BCY, were prepared into a mixed solution under stirring. EDTA and citric acid were added to the solution at the mole ratio of total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid of 1:1:2. NH 4 OH was applied to adjust the pH value of the solution to be around 6 during the water evaporation. Under stirring and heating, a clear viscous gel was obtained, which was solidified by pre-heating at 250 \u00b0C for several hours and finally calcined at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C for 5 h to obtain a pure-phase composite oxide with the nominated composition of BCY. 2.2 Cell fabrication Symmetrical cells with the configuration of electrode|BCY|electrode were used for the impedance studies. Dense BCY pellets of 12 mm in diameter and 0.55 mm in thickness were prepared by die pressing and sintered in air at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h. To prepare the electrode, the BSCF oxide powder was first prepared into a colloidal suspension by dispersing it into a mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol by high-energy ball milling (Fritsch Pulverisettle 6) at the rotation rate of 400 rpm for 0.5 h. It was then spray-deposited symmetrically on both surfaces of the BCY pellets, followed by calcined at 950\u20131100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. Silver paste was adopted as the current collectors. Anode-supported cells with BCY electrolyte were prepared using a co-pressing technique. Anode powders were prepared by well mixing of NiO and BCY in weight ratio of 60 to 40 by a high-energy ball miller. To fabricate the single cell, the NiO + BCY powder was first pressed as a substrate, onto which the fine BCY powder was added and pressed again to form a bi-layer pellet. The electrolyte thickness was controlled by the amount of BCY applied during the fabrication. A final anode thickness of 0.56 mm was adopted. The green pellets were then sintered in air at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h for the densification of the electrolyte layer, the diameter of the anode-supported cells is 13 mm. BSCF slurry was spray-deposited onto the central surface of the electrolyte and fired at various temperatures between 900 and 1100 \u00b0C in air for 2 h; the cathode effect area is \u223c0.26 cm \u22122 and its layer thickness is around 20 \u03bcm. 2.3 Electrochemical impedance test The electrode performance was investigated with the symmetrical or complete cell configuration by the ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation based on a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency applied was ranged from 0.01 Hz to 1000 kHz with a signal amplitude of 30 mV under open cell voltage (OCV). 2.4 Single-cell test The fuel cell reactor was put into a vertical split tube furnace, a thermocouple was inserted near the cathode surface both for the temperature controlling and monitoring. Three percent H 2 O humidified H 2 at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP: standard temperature and pressure] was fed into the anode chamber as fuel while ambient air was applied as the cathode atmosphere. I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-probe configuration. 2.5 Other characterization The phase structure of the oxides was examined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes or single cell were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The powders were also conducted oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) experiment. About 150 mg of sample was loaded in a quartz tube, which was then placed in a single-zone furnace equipped with a temperature controller. Argon was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The temperature was increased from 50 to 950 \u00b0C at the rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 and the effluent gases were monitored by the mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden, QIC-20). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase reaction between BSCF and BCY Interfacial phase reaction between fuel-cell components during the fuel-cell fabrication sometimes may become a practical problem. For example, it was found that the reaction between La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (cathode) and yttria-doped zirconia (electrolyte) was happened when the firing temperature for attaching the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface is 1100 \u00b0C or higher [39] . It led to the formation of non-conductive phases of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 and SrZrO 3 at the cathode\u2013electrolyte interface, which significantly increased the interfacial polarization resistance of the cell and substantially deteriorated the fuel cell performance. BSCF is an active material, which has turned out to be reactive with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte at high temperatures [40] . To get the information about the possible phase formation at the cathode\u2013electrolyte interface during the high-temperature firing, the solid-state reaction between BSCF and BCY was investigated by mixed powders. These two samples in powder state were mixed thoroughly at 1:1 weight ratio by high-energy ball milling for half hour and then calcined at various temperatures between 900 and 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. The resulted products were then submitted to phase composition examination. Fig. 1 A shows the room-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns of BSCF, BCY and the BSCF + BCY mixture after the calcinations at various temperatures. No other phase appeared even after the calcination at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h. A more detailed observation of the diffraction patterns reveals that the diffraction peak of BSCF at mirror index of (1 1 0) shifted steadily to the lower 2 \u03b8 direction with the increase of calcination temperature, while the diffraction peak of BCY perovskite at mirror index of (2 1 1) kept almost unmoved ( Fig. 1 B). Above phenomena strongly suggested that certain type of phase reaction between BSCF and BCY was actually happened during the high-temperature calcination, with the newly formed phases taking the same phase structure and similar lattice parameters to that of the reactants. In a recent study, Tolchard and Grande reported the physiochemical compatibility of SrCeO 3 with LaMO 3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co) oxides, and they observed that the diffusion of Sr 2+ in ceria is surprisingly fast with the primary reaction being the dissolution of SrO from SrCeO 3 into the LaMO 3 , and corresponding formation of La-doped CeO 2 [41] . Similar phase reaction by cation exchange is likely happened between BSCF and BCY in our case. Four possibilities are available, (1) the exchange of Sr 2+ in BSCF with Ba 2+ in BCY with the formation of Ba 2+ -enriched BSCF and Sr 2+ -substituted BCY; (2) the exchange of B-site cation; (3) the diffusion of Ba 2+ and Sr 2+ from BSCF to BCY with the formation of A-site cation-deficient BSCF and Ba 2+ -enriched BCY; and (4) the diffusion of Ba 2+ from BCY to BSCF with the formation of A-site cation-enriched BSCF perovskite and Ba 2+ -deficient BCY. Because Ba 2+ (12-coordinated with oxygen, 1.61 \u00c5) has larger ionic size than Sr 2+ at the A-site (12-coordinated with oxygen, 1.44 \u00c5) of perovskite, the cation exchange between Ba 2+ in BCY with Sr 2+ in BSCF would result in the lattice expansion of BSCF and the lattice shrinkage of BCY [42] . Since the lattice constant of BCY actually kept almost unchanged with respect to the firing temperature, the route (1) turns out to be unlikely, the route (2) is also less possible since the large difference in ionic radius between Ce 4+ /Y 3+ with Co 3+ /Fe 3+ in the B-site of perovskite. In our former studies [43,44] , we have demonstrated that BSCF can still sustain its perovskite lattice structure over a large deviation of its A / B cation ratio from unit (0.83 < A / B < 1.15) while the lattice parameter increased and decreased, respectively, for the A-site cation enrichment and deficiency. On the other hand, Ma and Iwahara et al. have demonstrated that BCY can also tolerate a large deviation of its A / B ratio away from unit (0.9 < A / B < 1.2) [45] , however its lattice constant kept almost unchanged no matter of either A-site cation deficiency or enrichment. Based on the results of Fig. 1 , it is likely that the Ba 2+ in BCY diffused to BSCF and resulted in the formation of Ba 2+ -deficient BCY and A-site Ba 2+ -enriched BSCF during the high temperature firing of BSCF + BCY mixture. In a previous paper, we have demonstrated that O 2 -TPD is an efficient and sensitive technique to characterize the local structural variation in BSCF [43] . Fig. 2 shows the O 2 -TPD curves of BCY, BSCF and BSCF + BCY mixture after calcined at various temperatures in air for 2 h. BCY demonstrated no any oxygen desorption peak, it agrees well with no any multivalent metal ion available in its structure. BSCF demonstrated a big desorption peak at the intermediate-temperature range of 300\u2013600 \u00b0C (\u03b1-peak) and a smaller desorption peak at 700\u2013900 \u00b0C (\u03b2-peak), ascribed to the reduction of Co 4+ /Fe 4+ to Co 3+ /Fe 4+ and Co 3+ to Co 2+ , respectively [42] . It was observed that the \u03b2-peak disappeared after the high-temperature firing. Shao and coauthors have demonstrated that the cation enrichment at the A-site of BSCF resulted in the disappearance of high-temperature oxygen desorption peak [44] , while the A-site cation deficiency resulted in increased intensity of the \u03b2-peak [43] . In another paper, Shao et al. have demonstrated that the \u03b2-peak could not be eliminated by varying the Ba 2+ to Sr 2+ ratio in the cation stoichiometric BSCF [42] . It then strongly supports that the reaction between BSCF and BCY is likely towards the formation A-site cation-enriched BSCF during the high-temperature firing. 3.2 Effect of interfacial reaction on the electrochemical performance To evaluate the interfacial phase reaction between BSCF cathode and BCY electrolyte on their electrochemical performance, cells with thick BCY electrolyte and symmetrical BSCF electrodes were prepared. In order to create different degree of reaction at the interface between BSCF and BCY, various firing temperatures to fix the electrode layers onto the electrolyte surfaces were tried. Fig. 3 shows the Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the various cells at 600 \u00b0C, with BSCF calcined between 900 and 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h. The high-frequency intercept of the impedance spectrum gives the ohmic resistance of the cell ( R ohm ), which includes the resistive contributions of the electrolyte, the two electrodes, the current collectors and the lead wires, and also the interfacial layer of the reaction products (A-site cation-enriched BSCF and A-site cation-deficient BCY). In this study, the ohmic resistance of the two electrodes, the current collectors and the lead wires was reasonably considered to be negligible or the same for all samples. The low-frequency intercept gives the total resistance ( R ohm + R p ) of the cell, which includes the ohmic resistance of the cell, concentration polarization (mass-transfer or gas-diffusion polarization) resistance, and the polarization resistance associated with the electrochemical reactions at the electrode surface. As shown in Fig. 3 , the ohmic resistance of the cell increased steadily with the temperature for firing the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface, while the polarization resistance did not change significantly. Fig. 4 A and B shows the temperature dependence of R ohm and R p , respectively. The ohmic resistance increased steadily with the firing temperature, and the increment in R ohm is obvious at a firing temperature of 1050 \u00b0C or higher. Ma and Iwahara et al. have demonstrated that the A-site Ba 2+ -enriched or A-site Ba 2+ -deficient BCY could show significant lower protonic conductivity as compared to the cation stoichiometric BCY [45] . Based on the phase-reaction results of this study, the increase in the ohmic resistance with the firing temperature is attributed to the increase of A-site cation deficiency for the interfacial phase formed between BSCF and BCY. The conductivity of the electrolyte calculated based on the ohmic resistance in Fig. 4 A is around 0.01 S cm \u22121 at 600 \u00b0C for the cell with cathode fired at 900 \u00b0C, which is comparable to the value (0.009 S cm \u22121 ) reported by Ma and Iwahara et al. for a cation stoichiometric BCY [45] . It suggests that the impact of interfacial phase formation on the conductivity of thick BCY is not serious at a firing temperature of 900 \u00b0C. In order to improve the cell performance, a decrease of the firing temperature for attaching the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface is then crucial. As compared to the ohmic resistance, the electrode polarization resistance was much less influenced by the firing temperature. The cells fired from 900 to 1000 \u00b0C show the lowest and highest area specific polarization resistances, respectively, at the operation temperature of 750 \u00b0C, while the 1050 \u00b0C calcined one shows the lowest and the 950 \u00b0C calcined one shows the highest at an operation temperature of 500 \u00b0C. As demonstrated in the previous section, the high-temperature firing resulted in the formation of an A-site Ba 2+ -enriched BSCF. Zhou et al. have demonstrated that at small degree of cation enrichment, the A-site cation-enriched BSCF oxide shows even better electrode performance than the cation stoichiometric one [44] . On the other hand, the increase of firing temperature also resulted in the decrease of effective electrode surface area due to the cathode sintering. As a whole, no clear tendency of the cathodic polarization resistance with respect to the firing temperature was observed. 3.3 Anode-supported single cell fabrication and test To evaluate the impact of the interfacial reaction between BSCF and BCY on the cathode performance of BSCF in a real fuel cell, or single cell with the configuration of (anode) BCY + NiO|thin-film BCY|BSCF (cathode) were constructed. Preparation of dense electrolyte membranes on porous anodes is an important step in the fabrication of high-performance SOFCs. Dual-dry pressing has tested to be a simple, reproducible and effective process for the preparation of anode-supported thin electrolyte dual-layer cell [46\u201348] . Several authors have also successfully reported the fabrication of supported thin-film protonic electrolyte by dual-dry pressing process [18\u201320] . In this study, the BCY + NiO anode-supported BCY dual-layer cells were also prepared by this technique. The thickness of the electrolyte was controlled by the amount of the electrolyte powder applied during the fabrication. The electrolyte layer is well densified and shows a main grain size of 1\u20132 \u03bcm ( Fig. 5 A ). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the electrolyte layer adhered to the anode surface pretty well, which ensures a low contacting resistance between anode and electrolyte layer. The corresponding SEM images of the BSCF/BCY interface is shown in Fig. 5 C, as we can see that there is no clear third layer appeared between BSCF and BCY layers. It suggests that the interface phase may be formed in a compositionally graded structure. We have tried the compositional analysis on the interface area by EDX method. However, due to the porous structure of the substrate the error is too large to get reasonable results. Definitively, it is worthwhile to find other method in our future work to clarify this issue. Fig. 5 D shows the cross-section image of a post-examined single cell, the anode is highly porous and the fuel cell anode and cathode still adheres with the electrolyte layer pretty well. Although a firing temperature of 900 \u00b0C has testified to result in the lowest degree of phase reaction between BSCF and BCY, as demonstrated by the symmetric cell test, the connection between cathode particles was relatively poor; therefore a firing temperature of 950 \u00b0C was applied for the single cell fabrication. For comparison, a firing temperature of 1100 \u00b0C was also conducted for the cathode layer. As shown in Fig. 6 are the SEM images of the cathodes fired at 950 and 1100 \u00b0C, respectively, the cathode fired at 1100 \u00b0C is much more sintered than that fired at 950 \u00b0C. Single cells with anode thickness of \u223c600 \u03bcm, electrolyte of \u223c50 \u03bcm and cathode of \u223c20 \u03bcm were applied for the I \u2013 V polarization test. Fig. 7 shows the I \u2013 V curves of the single cells operated on pure hydrogen as the anode fuel and ambient air as the cathode oxidant. The linear response of cell voltage with respect to applied current, even at high current density, suggests that the concentration polarization did not occur for both cells. An attractive peak power density of \u223c550 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at an operation temperature of 700 \u00b0C for the cell with its cathode layer fired at 950 \u00b0C. It represents one of the highest power densities achieved for SOFC based on the proton-conducting oxide electrolyte, up to now. Even at an operation temperature of 400 \u00b0C, a peak power density of \u223c100 mW cm \u22122 was also reached. Furthermore, a high OCV of \u223c1.06 V was observed at 400 \u00b0C, suggesting that the electrolyte is sufficiently dense to prevent the gas leakage. As compared to the reduced-temperature SOFC-O 2\u2212 , the decrease in performance with respect to the reduction of temperature is much slower for the current proton-conducting SOFC [26] . It implies that SOFC-H + may be more suitable than SOFC-O 2\u2212 for low-temperature operation. As compared to the cell with the cathode fired from 950 \u00b0C, the cell with 1100 \u00b0C fired cathode shows much worse performance, as shown in Fig. 7 B. A peak power density of only \u223c225 and \u223c60 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at an operation temperature of 700 and 400 \u00b0C, respectively, which is only about one half that of the cell with the cathode fired from 950 \u00b0C. Since this fuel cell also demonstrates high OCVs, the difference in their power densities is unlikely due to gas leakage. As shown in Fig. 8 is the EIS of the single cells under OCV condition. The polarization resistances presented here are a sum of the cathode and anode polarization resistances. Very low area-specific polarization resistance of \u223c0.36 \u03a9 cm 2 was observed at an operation temperature of 500 \u00b0C for the cell with cathode fired from 950 \u00b0C. It suggests that BSCF cathode performs pretty well with BCY electrolyte when the cathode was fired from 950 \u00b0C. Fig. 9 shows the total cell resistance ( R total ), electrode polarization resistance ( R p ), cell ohmic resistance ( R ohm ), and the ratio of ohmic resistance to cell resistance obtained from the impedance spectra at different temperatures. The ohmic resistance of the cell is still overwhelming at 500 \u00b0C. A reduction of the electrolyte thickness could then result in the increase of the cell performance significantly. As compared to the ohmic resistance, the polarization resistance of the cell increased only slightly with the firing temperature. For example, it is about 0.36 and 0.52 \u03a9 cm 2 at 500 \u00b0C, respectively, for the cell with its cathode fired at 950 and 1100 \u00b0C. To ensure a reasonable comparison of the different cathodes via the single-cell test, the microstructure of the electrodes and the electrolyte were fabricated as identical as possible for different cells by strictly optimizing the fabrication technique, therefore, it is reasonable to assume the difference in area-specific polarization resistance of the cells was mainly contributed from the variation in cathode activity. Based on Fig. 6 , such deterioration might be associated with the reduction of effective electrode surface area. However, the ohmic resistance of the cell increased more significantly from \u223c0.77 to \u223c1.39 \u03a9 cm 2 . Fig. 10 shows the conductivities of the electrolyte layer (including the interfacial layer) of the cells with its cathode fired at 950 and 1100 \u00b0C, calculated based on the impedance data of the single cell under OCV condition, for comparison, the conductivities of the symmetric cells measured in dry air and with the electrode layer fired at 950 and 1100 \u00b0C, are also presented. For the asymmetric cell, a conductivity of \u223c0.0125, 0.0088, and 0.0065 S cm \u22121 was achieved, respectively, at 700, 600 and 500 \u00b0C for the electrolyte (including the interfacial layer) with the cathode layer fired at 950 \u00b0C, while the conductivities decreased almost 50% for the electrolyte with the cathode fired at 1100 \u00b0C. It demonstrated that the formation of interfacial phase significantly blocked the protonic transportation from the electrolyte layer to the cathode layer, agreeing well with the results of the symmetric cell tests. It is reported that the protonic conductor usually shows smaller activation energy for proton conduction under hydrogen atmosphere than under air atmosphere [45] . Therefore, higher proton conductivity in air than in hydrogen is observed, respectively, at high temperature and low temperature zone. Higher conductivity of the electrolyte in the symmetric cell configuration (air/air) was observed at >600 \u00b0C than that in the asymmetric single cell configuration (air/H 2 ), agreeing with the literature results. The only available data about BSCF cathode for proton-conducting electrolyte fuel cell is reported by Peng et al. [18] . They applied a BSCF + BaCe 0.9 Sm 0.1 O 2.95 (BCS) composite oxide as the cathode for a proton-conducting BCS electrolyte and a firing temperature of \u223c1100 \u00b0C for fixing the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface. An area-specific polarization resistance of \u223c2.25 \u03a9 cm 2 was observed at 600 \u00b0C, which is significantly larger than our results. The electrode polarization resistance started to overwhelm the ohmic resistance at a temperature of 650 \u00b0C or lower. Their poor performance might be related with the high firing temperature (1100 \u00b0C) and the composite cathode applied. In the composite cathode, the A-site cation-deficient BCS was formed throughout the electrode layer, which could cover the BSCF surface and blocked the oxygen reduction over the cathode seriously. In our study, a pure BSCF was applied as the cathode layer, the phase reaction occurred only at the interface between BSCF cathode and BCY electrolyte. Therefore, the oxygen reduction properties of the cathode layer are not seriously affected. 4 Conclusions The ohmic resistance of the cells (symmetric/asymmetric) based on BCY electrolyte and BSCF cathode seriously depends on the phase reaction between them, while the cathodic polarization resistance is not obviously impacted. The phase reaction involves the diffusion of Ba 2+ from BCY electrolyte to the cathode and leads to the formation of Ba 2+ -enriched BSCF and Ba 2+ -deficient BCY interfacial phases, which have the same phase structure and similar lattice parameters to that of the reactants. Such impurity phases have small influence on the oxygen reduction kinetics over the cathode, however, they input a significant blocking effect on the proton transferring from electrolyte to the electrode. Therefore, an obvious increase of ohmic resistance of the cell was observed. The higher the firing temperature, the larger deviation of A / B ratio for the perovskites and the worse the cell performance, was observed. The optimal firing temperature is \u223c950 \u00b0C for the BSCF cathode layer. Anode-supported cell with electrolyte thickness of \u223c50 \u03bcm was successfully fabricated by a dual-dry pressing process. High performance of >500 mW cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C was reached for an anode-supported cell with the cathode layer fired from 950 \u00b0C, nearly twice that of the cell with cathode fired from 1100 \u00b0C. The results were attractive compared to the literature results. It suggests the potential application of BSCF as a cathode for SOFCs based on proton-conducting electrolytes. In order to further improve the cell performance, the reduction of electrolyte thickness and the prevention of the formation of Ba 2+ -deficient BCY at the cathode\u2013electrolyte interface is then of great importance, it will be our future research work on SOFC-H + . On the other hand, composite cathode by mixing BSCF with electrolyte material may be not a good choice.

        "abstract": "Layer-structured mixed conducting oxides with the composition Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.4) were synthesized and their performance as oxygen separating membranes was explored. The crystal structure, phase stability, oxygen absorption/desorption properties, and electrical conductivity of the oxides, as well as oxygen permeation fluxes of the corresponding membranes, were systematically investigated. The properties of YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 -based oxides were greatly improved by Ca incorporation into the lattice structure at an optimal concentration. In the series Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 , the Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membrane exhibited the highest oxygen permeation flux, reaching a value of 0.75 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C under the conditions of air/helium oxygen gradient and a membrane thickness of 1.0 mm. Studies of the effect of membrane thickness on the oxygen fluxes implied that at membrane thicknesses larger than 0.7 mm, the permeation process was mainly controlled by bulk diffusion, indicating the potential to further improve the oxygen fluxes via thinner membranes of asymmetric structure. Keywords Oxygen permeation Perovskite Mixed conductor Ceramic membrane 1 Introduction Mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite oxides are attracting much research interest for their potential applications as ceramic membranes for oxygen separation from air, membrane reactors for partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to value-added products, catalysts for combustion of environmental pollutants, and solid-oxide fuel cell cathodes for electric power generation [1\u201310] . Nowadays, environmental problems resulting from rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are challenging all industrialized countries. The production of electricity with zero carbon emissions to the atmosphere will become an essential element of future power infrastructure transformation. In this context, oxygen production by air separation is of particular importance, as most large-scale clean combustion technologies require oxygen as the feed gas. For example, if pure oxygen instead of air is used in power plants, the major constituent of the waste gas produced during the combustion process would be CO 2 , which can be readily and economically captured. Current tonnage O 2 production technology is based on expensive cryogenic distillation, which is impractical to integrate with coal gasifier or oxyfuel power plants because of its lower production efficiencies. Dense MIEC ceramic membranes can continuously deliver 100% pure O 2 under O 2 concentration gradients without the requirement of external electrical loadings, offering the potential to lower the oxygen production cost and improve the viability of CO 2 zero emission technology [11\u201316] . Recently, a group of cobalt-rich oxides with formula RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 (R = rare earth or yttrium) has captured the interest of many researchers due to their unique magnetic and electrochemical properties [17\u201323] . RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 has a crystal structure similar to that of hexagonal LuBaAlZnO 7 with more details shown in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, this layered structure is composed of Kagome sheets of CoO 4 tetrahedra linked by triangular layers of CoO 4 tetrahedra. Two different cobalt sites, i.e., Co1 and Co2, are tetrahedrally coordinated with the ratio of 3:1 between Co1 in Kagome and Co2 in the triangular lattice. The crystal structure of RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 is hexagonal with space group P 6 3 m [17,18] . Recently, Karppinen et al. reported that YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 has good oxygen desorption/adsorption capability at relatively low temperatures (200\u2013400 \u00b0C) because its unique structure provides wide spaces for easy oxygen incorporation [19] . So far, most previous studies related to these layered RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 materials were focused on the magnetic and thermoelectric properties at intermediate temperatures. However, studies of their application as dense ceramic membranes for oxygen separation are still scarce. The oxygen permeation through these MIEC membranes involves many steps, such as bulk diffusion and surface oxygen exchange reactions. When the membrane thickness is much less than the critical value, the surface reaction kinetics will largely control the oxygen permeation rate. The surface exchange reactions consist of many substeps such as oxygen absorption, dissociation, as well as reactions among absorbed oxygen, oxygen vacancies, lattice oxygen, and electron holes. One effective way to facilitate the surface reaction rates is to prepare the MIEC membranes from materials with inherently good oxygen desorption/adsorption capability and YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 seems to be a good choice for a new membrane material. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using these new layered YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 perovskite oxides as MIEC membranes and their performance in air separation. In order to introduce more oxygen vacancies inside the YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 lattice to speed up the oxygen permeation rate, Y 3+ was partially substituted by another metal ion with lower valence state but larger ionic radius (i.e., Ca 2+ ) via a doping strategy. A series of Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxides were prepared by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing method. The effects of Ca 2+ doping on the structural stability, oxygen desorption properties, electrical conductivity, and oxygen permeation behavior were carefully examined. 2 Experimental Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.025, 0.3, 0.4) composite oxides were synthesized through a sol-gel process based on the EDTA-citrate complexing method [24,25] . Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , Ba(NO 3 ) 2 Co(NO 3 ) 2 , and Y(NO 3 ) 3 (all in A.R. grade) were used as the raw materials for the metal-ion sources. The raw materials were first prepared into aqueous solutions with concentration around 1 M. The precision concentrations were determined by the EDTA titration technique. EDTA powder was added into aqueous ammonium hydroxide to form a water-soluble ammonium salt. Stoichiometric amounts of metal nitrates and citric acid were dissolved in distilled water. The required amount of EDTA was introduced into the nitrate solution under stirring. The mole ratio of EDTA and citric acid to the total metal ions in the final solution was 1:2:1. The pH value of the solution was adjusted at 6 by the addition of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O. The solution was heated to \u223c90 \u00b0C over a hot plate under magnetic stirring until a gel was formed. This gel was heated in a preheated oven at 250 \u00b0C to obtain a black solid mass called the precursor powder. The precursor powder was calcined at 950\u20131000 \u00b0C in air for 5 h to form the oxide powders with desired structures. Lattice parameters of Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7 powders were calculated with the help of the software named Accelrys MS Modeling 3.0, and the related computation program was TREOR 90. The as-obtained oxide powders were then pressed into disk-shaped membranes in a stainless steel die (15.0 mm in diameter) under a hydraulic pressure of approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 Pa. These green disks (\u223c1.0 mm in thickness) were further sintered at 1100\u20131200 \u00b0C for 2\u20135 h. The relative density of the sintered membranes was measured by the Archimedes liquid displacement technique ( Table 1 ). Their microstructure was examined by environmental scanning electronic microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The crystal structure of the synthesized powders or sintered membranes was characterized with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The room-temperature oxygen nonstoichiometry was measured by the iodometry titration technique and details can be found elsewhere [26] . The oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) analysis was carried out by mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC-20). One hundred milligram oxide powder was placed inside a U-type quartz reactor with the inner diameter of 3 mm. A K-type thermocouple was used for temperature monitoring. A constant helium (purity >99.999%) or air flow at the rate of 20 ml min \u22121 under the conditions of standard temperature and pressure (STP) was introduced to the reactor. After flowing with air gas for around 30 min at 300 \u00b0C to guarantee that the samples sufficiently absorbed oxygen, the reactor was heated at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 to 950 \u00b0C. Oxygen was released from the oxide lattice during the heating process and carried out by the flowing helium to mass spectrometer for in-situ concentration analysis. The electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe dc method based on sintered bars with the dimensions of 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 12 mm 3 . The measurement techniques were performed in air upon cooling from 900 to 300 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C per step. A constant current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage responses were recorded using a Keithley 2420 Sourcemeter. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to a maximum value of 2 A. Details of the conductivity measurement techniques are described elsewhere [26] . Oxygen permeation properties of the membranes were investigated by the gas chromatography (GC) technique. A silver paste was used as the sealant to fix the membrane disk onto a dense quartz tube and expose an effective membrane area of \u223c0.45 cm 2 at the sweep side for the permeation study. The sidewall of the membrane was also covered with the silver paste to avoid radial contribution to the oxygen flux. Air was supplied from a gas cylinder to the oxygen-rich side at a flow rate of 400 ml min \u22121 [STP], while helium was applied as the sweep gas at a flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 [STP] to collect the permeated oxygen to a Varian GC equipped with a 5 \u00c5 capillary molecule column for analysis. For checking whether the membrane is gas tight at room temperature, we use the bubble flow meter to confirm that there is no gas leakage. At high temperature in oxygen permeation experiment, oxygen concentration in outlet gases from sweep side could be nearly up to 1.1%, and nitrogen was also observed in these outlet gases with concentration nearly up to 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 %. Details of the oxygen permeation measurements can also be found elsewhere [26] . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure and stability Fig. 2 shows the room-temperature XRD patterns of Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.4) oxides prepared by calcination of the precursor powders at 1000 \u00b0C in air for 5 h. The parent oxide YCaBaCo 4 O 7 , or the doped Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxides with lower Ca doping concentrations ( x \u2264 0.2), displayed a single-phase layered perovskite structure with hexagonal symmetry and space group of P 6 3 mc [17,18] . However, a careful examination of the calculated lattice parameters listed in Table 2 shows the doping effects on the unit cell parameters. The increase of Ca content in Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 slightly increases the lattice parameters. For instance, the cell parameters of the parent oxide and the oxides with 10% and 20% Ca incorporation are as follows: a : 6.30 \u00c5; c : 10.24 \u00c5; V : 352.9 \u00c5 3 (YCaBaCo 4 O 7 ); a : 6.32 \u00c5; c : 10.28 \u00c5; V : 357.1 \u00c5 3 (Y 0.9 Ca 0.1 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ); a : 6.33 \u00c5; c : 10.29 \u00c5; V : 359.2 \u00c5 3 (Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ). This observation can be explained by the fact that calcium has a much larger ionic radius (1.12 \u00c5) than yttrium (1.01 \u00c5). With the further increase of Ca concentration up to 25% or above, some additional peaks appeared. It is possible that A site coordination in layered perovskite Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 cannot tolerate high concentrations of elements with larger ionic radius due to strict requirements of the crystal field stabilization. However, at this stage, these impurity phases cannot be identified. To test the structural stability of Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxides, the samples were annealed in nitrogen or air flow at 850 \u00b0C for 6 h and cooled to room temperature for XRD examination. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . Under nitrogen atmosphere, the layered perovskite phase structure of Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 was stable with no impurity phases detected. However, under air atmosphere, some phase transitions can be noticed for samples with lower Ca content ( x = 0.0\u20130.025). Similar observations have been made by other researchers during investigation of the oxygen adsorptive behavior of RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 at high temperatures [19] . The phase transition was caused by decomposition of the YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 phase to BaCoO 3 with oxygen adsorption at high temperatures. In the Y\u2013Ba\u2013Co\u2013O\u2013air system, the YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 phase is thermodynamically stable only at temperatures higher than 900 \u00b0C [19] . Walldor and Andersson found that Kagome Co1 triangles were possibly in a position where oxygen from the adsorption process might be incorporated [17,18] . In this absorption process, some CoO 4 tetrahedra would convert to pyramids or octahedra, resulting in sublattice distortion or disorder. A high-level Ca doping ( x = 0.5\u20130.2) improved the material stability of Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 in air atmosphere at high temperatures. This is demonstrated by the XRD patterns of three samples of higher Ca content shown in Fig. 3 a. The larger lattice parameters of the samples with higher Ca content may provide more space, reducing the adverse effects of distortion of the Co1\u2013O sublattice by oxygen adsorption. 3.2 Oxygen desorption properties Based on TGA technology, the oxygen absorption properties of RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 have been investigated by several groups [20\u201323] . In this work, we used the O 2 -TPD technique to further investigate the oxygen desorption properties of such oxides. With rising temperature, the reduction of metal ions from high to low oxidation state takes place together with the creation of oxygen vacancies in the oxide and the release of oxygen from the lattice. For cobalt-based perovskite-related oxides, the oxygen desorption at 200\u2013600 \u00b0C (\u03b1-peak) is typically associated with the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ while the \u03b2-peak is related to the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ and usually appears at a temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C. Fig. 4 shows the O 2 -TPD profiles of the Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxides. It can be observed that all samples have typical desorption with the \u03b1-peak in the lower temperature zone (300\u2013500 \u00b0C), consistent with the observations of other researchers [19] . At first glance, the difference in the oxygen desorption behavior before and after the Ca doping is not obvious. However, a careful examination of all \u03b1-peaks illustrates the temperature at which the oxygen desorption moves to a lower value after Ca incorporation and with the increase in Ca concentration. By virtue of the larger crystal volume caused by Ca incorporation, the Columbic attraction between cations and oxygen ions would be decreased, facilitating oxygen ion diffusion and molecular oxygen desorption. Further comparison of the oxygen desorption at temperatures higher than 750 \u00b0C shows that the intensity of \u03b2-peaks is gradually decreased with the increase in Ca concentration, particularly for the sample Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 . This suggests that the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ is suppressed by the introduction of Ca in the lattice structure. At elevated temperatures, the change in cobalt valence state usually accounts for the thermal instability of the compounds due to the mismatch of the different cobalt ion radii (Co 3+ to Co 2+ ) in the sublattices between Co1\u2013O and Ba/Y\u2013O. More importantly, this may result in the collapse of the layered perovskite structure. Therefore, it is clear that Ca doping at the appropriate concentration improves the structural stability by suppressing the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2 at high temperatures. 3.3 Electrical conductivity The oxygen permeability of MIEC membranes is closely related to their oxygen ionic and electronic conductivities. An excellent oxygen-permeable membrane should possess high electronic and oxygen ionic conductivities over the operational conditions. The effect of Ca doping on the conductivities of the Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxide under air or inert gas atmosphere was investigated. Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity from 300 to 900 \u00b0C in air or nitrogen atmosphere. The conductivity decreased with the drop of oxygen partial pressure, implying a p-type electronic conductivity mechanism. Pure YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 without Ca incorporation has the highest conductivity value of 270 S cm \u22121 in air, while increasing the Ca content steadily reduces the electronic conductivity. The phase transition of YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 -based oxides at lower temperatures in air changes the crystal structure, reducing hole mobility, which may result in poorer electrical conductivity at lower temperatures. Electronic conduction within perovskite-related oxides is believed to occur via a process similar to the Zerner double exchange process [27] . The conductivity can be affected by the degree of overlap between the electron clouds of oxygen and cobalt ions. Ca incorporation stretches the Co\u2013O bond, which makes the electron hopping more difficult and thus lowers the electronic conductivity. It is also observed that the electronic conductivity in nitrogen decreases sharply after 600 \u00b0C, and then levels off at 800 \u00b0C, especially for YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 . This may indicate the unique oxygen adsorption/desorption capability of RBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxide at high temperatures. According to the p-type electronic conducting mechanism, oxygen adsorption/desorption from the crystal lattice may influence electronic conduction. The oxygen adsorption can decrease the concentration of electron carriers such as electronic holes. As can be seen, when Ca content increases, the magnitude of conductivity decreases at high temperatures. This phenomenon is associated with weaker oxygen adsorption in Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxides, suggesting a relatively stable phase structure in these Ca-doped oxides. In addition, the electronic conductivity of all samples in nitrogen atmosphere is quite high, with the maximum value of \u223c70 S cm \u22121 at a temperature of \u223c600 \u00b0C. The observed higher conductivity of all samples in nitrogen atmosphere is attributed to the easy electron hopping along a continuous two-dimension network of Co\u2013O bonds in the Co1\u2013O layer. 3.4 Oxygen permeation properties The Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membranes used for the oxygen permeation test were sintered at 1100\u20131200 \u00b0C and the microstructure of the ceramic membranes was observed via SEM. All membranes displayed similar morphology under these sintering conditions, with a grain size up to 10 \u03bcm; a typical Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membrane is shown in Fig. 6 . Gas leakage tests at room temperature confirmed that there were no through pinholes inside the ceramic disks. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of oxygen permeation fluxes through Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3) membranes with helium flow rate fixed at 100 ml min \u22121 [STP]. All membranes were of 1.0 mm thickness and their surfaces were polished to ensure relatively similar surface morphology. For YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 and Y 0.975 Ca 0.025 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membranes, cracks were observed. The crack formation resulted from the internal stress created by the phase structure transition. The oxygen flux through Y 0.9 Ca 0.1 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 rose from 0.12 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 0.33 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 as the temperature increased from 750 to 850 \u00b0C. Further inspection of the Ca doping effect on the fluxes at similar temperatures gives more important information. Over the entire range of the temperature investigated, the parent YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 or Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.025) membranes demonstrated the lowest permeation fluxes ranging from 0.06 \u00d7 10 \u22126 (750 \u00b0C) to 0.14 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 (900 \u00b0C). As discussed previously, both samples of YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 and Y 0.975 Ca 0.025 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 experienced a phase transition in oxygen-containing atmosphere at high temperatures and their perovskite structure was totally replaced by other phases (as shown in Fig. 3 ). Such phase transitions are detrimental to oxygen ion diffusion and thus result in poor oxygen permeation behavior. A higher Ca doping concentration (0.05 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2) inside the structure of YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 stabilizes the perovskite phase and therefore gives a significant increase in the oxygen permeation fluxes of the resultant membranes. When the doping concentration x is increased from 0.05 to 0.2, the oxygen absorption/desorption of the Co1\u2013O sublattice in Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 is suppressed at high temperatures, which further improves the stability of the layered perovskite phase and thus contributes to higher oxygen fluxes. On the other hand, when more Y 3+ ions are substituted by Ca 2+ , a higher oxygen vacancy concentration will be formed to maintain the charge neutrality as evidenced by the data in Table 2 . The most preferable positions for oxygen vacancies in YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 -based oxides may be under the Kagome Co1 triangles ( Fig. 1 ). Higher concentrations of oxygen vacancies also contribute to larger oxygen fluxes. Oxygen permeation fluxes therefore gradually improve as Ca doping increases from x = 0.05 to 0.2. With an increase in Ca content above 0.2, the oxygen permeation flux begins to drop due to deterioration of the layered perovskite structure at high Ca content. It is clear from the Ca doping concentration analysis that Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 is the best composition for layered Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 oxides to be used as a membrane material. Meanwhile, a careful examination of the improving trend of the oxygen fluxes with the temperature increment in Fig. 7 illustrates that such increasing trend has been enlarged when the temperature is over 850 \u00b0C indicating that the change of the activation energy makes the oxygen permeation process easier after 850 \u00b0C. This activation energy change may be related to the phase transition. As discussed before, in the Y\u2013Ba\u2013Co\u2013O\u2013air system, the YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 phase is thermodynamically stable only at higher temperatures (>850 \u00b0C). However, with the increase in Ca 2+ content, such transition was obviously inhibited. Therefore, the oxygen permeation value of the corresponding membranes with higher Ca 2+ content ( x > 0.2) seemed to keep the same increasing trend when membrane operation was from the lower temperature zone (700\u2013850 \u00b0C) to the higher temperature zone (>850 \u00b0C). At 900 \u00b0C, the oxygen permeation flux across Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membrane reaches 0.75 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 for the 1 mm thick membrane. As shown in Fig. 8 , the value is much higher than those for other layered oxides, such as LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = lanthanide) [28] . The significant improvement of the oxygen permeation flux for the Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membrane is mainly due to its unique structure, which possesses wide spaces for easy oxygen incorporation and good oxygen desorption/adsorption capability at relatively low temperatures. Fig. 9 shows the effects of membrane thickness on the permeation fluxes at various temperatures with a He sweep rate of 100 ml min \u22121 [STP] and membrane material composition of Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 . As can be seen, decreasing membrane thickness is very effective for increasing the flux. As an example, the fluxes through the membranes at 800 \u00b0C for thicknesses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 mm are 0.59 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 0.41 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 0.26 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 , respectively. Oxygen permeation through the MIEC membranes is controlled by the oxygen ion bulk diffusion rate as well as the surface exchange kinetics on either side of the membrane. In order to clarify the controlling steps, the proportionality ( K d 1 / d 2 ) between the oxygen flux and the membrane thickness was calculated via the following equation: (1) K d 1 / d 2 = J O 2 ( d 1 ) J O 2 ( d 2 ) d 1 d 2 In Eq. (1) , J O 2 ( d ) stands for flux at membrane thickness d at a specific temperature. When the oxygen permeation is totally controlled by the slow oxygen bulk diffusion, K should be equal to or close to 1, which can be derived by the application of Wagner theory [29] . While K d 1 / d 2 is equal to the value d 1 / d 2 , the permeation process should be governed by surface exchange kinetics. As shown in Fig. 10 , K d 1 / d 2 is close to 1 within the investigated membrane thickness range of 0.7\u20131.5 mm. This suggests that oxygen transport was mainly rate determined by the slow oxygen bulk diffusion process. To further speed up the oxygen permeation fluxes of Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membranes, membrane thicknesses should be further reduced, which can be achieved using a composite membrane of asymmetric structure. 4 Conclusions Layered perovskite Y 1\u2212 x Ca x BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.4) oxides were synthesized by an EDTA-citrate complexing method and explored as potential materials for ceramic membranes for air separation. The calcium doping concentration ( x ) in the lattice structure had significant effects on the phase structure stability, oxygen absorption/desorption properties, electrical conductivity, and oxygen permeation flux of the oxides. To maintain the layered perovskite structure, the calcium doping in YBaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 should be controlled at less than x = 0.2. The calcium incorporation led to a decrease of electronic conductivity but an increase of oxygen nonstoichiometry in the oxides at room temperature. At 900 \u00b0C, the permeation flux through a 1 mm thick Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membrane reached \u223c0.75 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 under an oxygen gradient created by air and helium. The oxygen permeation through thick Y 0.8 Ca 0.2 BaCo 4 O 7+ \u03b4 membranes was rate limited mainly by the relatively slow oxygen bulk diffusion. Decreasing membrane thickness would be an effective way to further improve the oxygen permeation fluxes.

        "abstract": "The formation mechanism of a spinel-type lithium titanate Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with TiO 2 anatase as raw material, in both a conventional solid-state reaction (SSR) and a cellulose-assisted glycine-nitrate combustion (cellulose-GN) process are comparatively studied. XRD characterization demonstrates high-purity Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 forms at 750 \u00b0C by the cellulose-GN synthesis, which occurs at a temperature at least 100 \u00b0C lower than that via SSR. The solid-phase reaction between TiO 2 and lithium compounds to form Li\u2013Ti\u2013O spinel and the phase transition of TiO 2 from anatase to \u201cinert\u201d rutile phase occur competitively during both synthesis processes. SEM results suggest that the solid precursor from the cellulose-GN process has a smaller particle size and a more homogenous mixing of the reactants than that in the SSR. Temperature-programmed oxidation experiments demonstrate that cellulose thermal pyrolysis creates a reducing atmosphere, which may facilitate the oxygen-ion diffusion. Both factors facilitate the formation of Li\u2013Ti\u2013O spinel, while the TiO 2 anatase transforms to TiO 2 rutile during the SSR, which has slow lithium-insertion kinetics. As a result, a high calcination temperature is necessary to obtain a phase-pure Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . Charge\u2013discharge and EIS tests demonstrate the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 obtained by the cellulose-GN process shows much better low-temperature electrochemical performance than that obtained by standard SSR. This improvement attributes to the reduced particle size due to the lower synthesis temperature. Keywords Lithium titanate Combustion synthesis Solid-state reaction Titanium dioxide",

        "title": "Influence of high-energy ball milling of precursor on the morphology and electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12\u2013ball-milling time",
        "abstract": "High-energy ball milling (HEBM) was applied for the synthesis of spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 and the influence of milling time was investigated systematically. With the increase of ball-milling time, the average particle size of the as-synthesized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powder decreased from ~ 900\u00a0nm to ~ 150\u00a0nm, while the particle morphology changed little. At the same time, the main particle size distribution peak split up into two parts, which were narrowed and moved to a smaller range. Electrochemical testing results showed that the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with precursor milled for 60\u00a0min at 500\u00a0rpm rotational speed showed a favorable discharge capacity of ~ 146.9\u00a0mAh/g with corresponding coulombic efficiency of 99.9% at 1\u00a0C rate. The rate performance was improved with the increase of milling time because of the smaller particle size of the resulted Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The voltage change between oxidation peak and reduction peak of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 also became wider with milling time increasing. Keywords High-energy ball milling Precursor Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 Electrochemical performance 1 Introduction Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is one of the most promising anode materials for high-power batteries or hybrid capacitors because of its unique properties. It is also called a \u201czero-strain\u201d material because of its small structure changes during Li + intercalation/de-intercalation processes [1\u20133] . In comparison with natural graphite, it shows better thermal stability [4] and sharper voltage wave that can be served as an over charge/discharge indicator. Furthermore, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 can be combined with many other electrode materials to obtain new power sources [5] . On the other hand, the electrochemical performance of the electrode is closely related with its specific morphology. Some particle morphologies have been demonstrated to be beneficial for improving the electrode performance [6,7] . HEBM is a promising way to synthesize micro- or nano-structured high-performance materials for a wide range of applications. It mainly utilizes the mechanical energy originating from the constant collisions between particles and balls or bowl to meliorate the performance of materials or promote a solid-state reaction [8\u201314] . In a HEBM process, the reactants are subjected to a thorough pulverization and intimate powder mixing [8] . As compared to other ball-milling processes, HEBM is more efficient in enhancing the reaction rate or modifying the particle morphology of materials [9] . Ball-milling time and rotational speed are two key factors that may affect the performance of the resulted materials. According to the literature there is no related work available. In this study, the influence of milling time on the morphology and consequently the electrochemical performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 synthesized by HEBM was specifically investigated in detail. 2 Experimental A series of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders were synthesized by a HEBM-assisted solid-state reaction. The raw materials, anatase TiO 2 (~ 20\u00a0nm), LiOH\u00b7H 2 O (AR), activated carbon (~ 1993\u00a0m 2 /g) and glycol, at the weight ratio of 1.2:1:6.8:28.5, were well mixed by high-energy ball milling using ZrO 2 balls and bowl at a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 47:1. The milling was performed in air at 500\u00a0rpm rotational speed for different times. The as-obtained black slurry was dried and further calcined at 800\u00a0\u00b0C in air for 12\u00a0h to result in the final white products [15] . The as-synthesized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders were grounded and then mixed well with 10\u00a0wt.% SuperP conductive additive (Shanghai Hersbit Chemical Co., Ltd, China) and 5\u00a0wt.% LA-132 binder (Chengdu Indigo Power Sources Co., Ltd, China), which were mechanically homogenized in an agate mortar to form slurry for coating on a cleaned copper foil. After drying at 100\u00a0\u00b0C under vacuum for several hours, it was laminated and cut into 0.76\u00a0cm 2 wafer for use as working electrode. Metal lithium was used as counter and reference electrode. Electrochemical cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box by sandwiching a Celgard 2400 microporous separator between two electrodes using an electrolyte of 1.0\u00a0M LiPF 6 /ethylene carbonate\u2013dimethyl carbonate (1:1 in vol.) (Zhangjiagang Guotai-Huarong New Chemical Co., Ltd, China). Above cells were cycled galvanostatically between 1.0 and 3.0\u00a0V vs . Li/Li + at 298\u00a0K on a Neware battery-testing instrument (Shenzhen Neware Technology Ltd, China). Voltammetric technique was performed on an electrochemical workstation combined with a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 SEM analysis XRD results showed that the obtained products were spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . From the SEM images shown in Fig. 1 , the as-synthesized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powder with its precursor milled at 500\u00a0rpm had a smaller particle size than the others. Much less degree of aggregation was observed for the HEBM-derived samples as compared to that synthesized by a normal high-temperature solid-state reaction. The quasi-spherical particle morphology of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , however, did not change a lot, when the average particle size decreased from ~ 900\u00a0nm to ~ 150\u00a0nm with the milling time increased from 0\u00a0min to 120\u00a0min. It indicates that HEBM is an effective tool to reduce the particle size of the resulted product [10] , while the particle morphology is less impacted. 3.2 Effects of milling on particle size From the results obtained by Laser Particle Analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer 300, UK) in Fig. 2 , the main particle size distribution peak of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 split up into two when the milling time increased from 0\u00a0min to 120\u00a0min. Such a phenomenon was also observed in the preparation of Li 2 Ti 3 O 7 by ball milling [16] . It was originated from the unequal chances of the precursor milled between balls and bowl, because the moving particles and centrifugal moving balls are synchronous and the effective collision is various. The particle size of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 without precursor treated by HEBM was big and concentrated on a wide range of 400\u20131000\u00a0nm, while the particle size of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with its precursor milled by HEBM became smaller and concentrated on two ranges. It implies that the HEBM may affect greatly the particle size distribution. The particle size distributions of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with its precursor milled for 60\u00a0min concentrated on two ranges of 160\u2013260\u00a0nm and 600\u2013900\u00a0nm, while for 120\u00a0min concentrated on 90\u2013180\u00a0nm and 500\u2013600\u00a0nm. The longer ball-milling time of precursor resulted in a decline of particle size of the resulted powder after further calcination, agreeing with above SEM results. 3.3 Electrochemical performance Fig. 3 shows the typical galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 at 1\u00a0C rate. They demonstrated a charge and discharge voltage of ~ 1.6\u00a0V and ~ 1.5\u00a0V, respectively, consisting well with other results [1\u20137,15] . On the other hand, between the milling time of 0\u00a0min and 60\u00a0min, the charge/discharge voltage plateau of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 became wider with the increase of ball-mill time of the precursor. It suggests that the utilizable capacity increased with balling time prolonging. After 60\u00a0min, the charge/discharge profiles changed little with the further increase of milling time. According to Fig. 4 , the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with precursor milled for 60\u00a0min showed the best electrochemical performance at 1\u00a0C rate with a discharge capacity of 146.9\u00a0mAh/g and a corresponding coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. However, the rate performance increased monotonously with the ball-milling time, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The improved rate performance of the powder at increased ball-milling time was attributed to the smaller particle size, which ensures a smaller diffusion resistance and larger surface reaction sites during the charge and discharge processes [17,18] . With discharge rate increasing from 1\u00a0C to 10\u00a0C, the capacity fading of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 reached 47.4%, 32.9% and 23.4 % as corresponding milling time was 0\u00a0min, 60\u00a0min and 120\u00a0min, respectively. Therefore, the milling time of HEBM should be optimized to match the electrochemical performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . Fig. 5 is the voltammetric curves of the prepared Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 at 2\u00a0mV/s scan rate. They all showed good cathodic and anodic peaks, corresponding to the Li + insertion and Li + deinsertion, respectively. The peak position is not exactly at ~ 1.6\u00a0V or ~ 1.5\u00a0V, because it is a function of the applied scan rate [19] . Since the open circuit voltage was near 3.0\u00a0V, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was inserted with Li + at first step and then de-inserted Li + in cycle. The overall reaction in the cell is given as follows (1) Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 + 3Li + + 3 \u0113 \u21ccLi 7 Ti 5 O 12 Increasing milling time from 0\u00a0min to 120\u00a0min, the position of the oxidation peak moved from 1.75 to 1.85\u00a0V, while the position of corresponding reduction peak moved from 1.45 to 1.35\u00a0V, suggesting the voltage change between oxidation peak and reduction peak increased. 4 Summary HEBM utilized the mechanical energy originating from fast collisions to change effectively the particle size and electrochemical performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The longer milling time led to a smaller particle size and the split of the main particle size distribution peak from one to two. The average particle size decreased from ~ 900\u00a0nm to ~ 150\u00a0nm when milling time increased from 0\u00a0min to 120\u00a0min. However, milling time had little effect on the quasi-spherical morphology. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests showed that a milling time of 60\u00a0min was beneficial to improve the capacity and efficiency of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 at 1\u00a0C rate. The discharge capacity and corresponding coulombic efficiency could reach 146.9\u00a0mAh/g and 99.9%, respectively. However, the rate capability increased with milling time prolonging, which was attributed to the smaller particle size. With discharge rate increasing from 1\u00a0C to 10\u00a0C, the capacity fading of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 reached 47.4%, 32.9% and 23.4 % as corresponding milling time was 0\u00a0min, 60\u00a0min and 120\u00a0min, respectively. Voltammetric curves indicated that the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 had good cathodic and anodic peaks, and the voltage change between oxidation peak and reduction peak became wider with milling time increasing.

        "abstract": "Single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs), which apply fuel-oxidant (air) gas mixture as the atmosphere for both anode and cathode, are receiving many interests recently. This study aims to clarify the mechanism of oxygen reduction and methane oxidization over La0.8Sr0.2MnO 3 (LSM) cathode in SC-SOFCs by an electrochemical method in combination with mass spectrometry (MS). Before cathodic polarization, a large polarization resistance (Rp) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was observed and methane did not cause obvious effect on ORR because of the weak adsorption of methane over LSM surface. Cathodic polarization could decrease the Rp obviously due to the in-situ creation of oxygen vacancies; methane likely adsorbed on those oxygen vacancy sites to enhance its effect on ORR. Both the anodic and cathodic polarizations significantly increased the rate of methane oxidation over LSM electrode; in particular, the pumped oxygen anion was highly active for methane oxidation.

        "title": "Functional nano-composite oxides synthesized by environmental-friendly auto-combustion within a micro-bioreactor",
        "abstract": "Nano-crystalline Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC), Gd 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (GDC), La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF) and NiO (65 wt.%)\u2013GDC powders for applications in solid-oxide fuel cells were synthesized by employing cotton fibers as the micro-bioreactor. As compared with the conventional glycine-nitrate (GN) combustion method, this novel process allows the preparation process to be more environmental-friendly. Furthermore, the particle size of obtained powders could be smaller, attributing to the blocking effect of cellulose on suppressing the particle contact during synthesis. By this innovative method, SDC powder with a particle size as small as \u223c10 nm, was obtained, which can be easily sintered to dense electrolytes at 1350 \u00b0C. The process is also capable for large-scale synthesis. Keywords A. Ceramics A. Nanostructures B. Chemical synthesis 1 Introduction Some multi-metal-component composite oxides with oxygen ionic/electronic or mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity at high temperatures have promising applications in the field of oxidative catalysis, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), gas sensors, metal\u2013air batteries and ceramic oxygen separation membranes [1\u201310] . For ceramic oxides, as the size of the particles becomes smaller, the ratio of the total surface area to volume increases steadily, which can affect many physical, chemical, mechanical, electrical, optical and magnetic properties of these materials. Nano-structured ceramic oxides have been reported to exhibit dramatic increase in strength, hardness, and super-plasticity. The nano-sized powders can also result in a significant reduction of the temperature needed to densify the pellet made of the ceramic oxides through calcination. It is beneficial for applications in ceramic oxygen separation membranes and electrolytes in SOFCs [11,12] . In addition, for some conducting oxides, such as yttria-stabilized zirconia and doped ceria, the specific grain boundary dc ionic conductivities of their nano-crystalline were shown to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of micro-size counterparts [13,14] , which is beneficial as a solid electrolyte in SOFCs and gas sensors. The nano-structured materials can also effectively increase the surface area for catalytic oxidation and electrode reaction, resulting in an increase in the catalytic activity and electrode performance [3,15,16] . Comparing single-metal oxides, multi-metal composite oxides are much more difficult to synthesize. For the formation of the composite oxides, in order to create the corresponding metal\u2013oxygen bond according to the defined crystal structure, the various metal ions in the raw materials should be reorganized on the atom scale via solid-state diffusion with the help of an external energy source. This process typically requires high activation energy. A composite oxide with bi- or multi-metal components would require an excessive calcination temperature and a potentially prolonged dwell time. Such a process, however, frequently leads to serious sintering of the powders, especially for the type of composite oxides with oxygen ionic/electronic conductivity, which have a high surface energy due to the high mobility of surface oxygen. The synthesis of nano-structured conducting oxides, especially in large scale, is therefore a practical challenge. Combustion synthesis has attracted considerable attention recently due to its fast heating rate, high synthesis temperature and short reaction time. It has the advantages of low processing cost, high energy efficiency, and high production rate [17] . However, for the traditional combustion synthesis process, the resulted powder could have a large crystalline size due to the ultra-high synthesis temperature. On the other hand, the large amount of gas products developed during the combustion can limit the contact between particles and hence suppressing the coarsening and agglomeration of the powders to some extent, which leads to the creation of a large amount of smog and ash by blowing away the combustion products. It results in not only the loss of the products, but also serious impact on the environment. In this study, we proposed a constricted-space environmental-friendly auto-combustion process for the synthesis of nano-crystalline conducting oxides by applying a micro-bioreactor. As the most abundant renewable polysaccharide in nature with a yield of 9.5 million tonnes per year, cotton cellulose, was investigated as the bioreactor. Cellulose has been widely applied in the chemical synthesis process recently. Various products ranging from metal to oxides with a hierarchical structure were prepared by using cellulose as the template due to its distinct fiber morphology [18\u201324] . Fig. 1 shows the typical structures of cellulose from macroscopic to microscopic. It has the hierarchical wall. The morphological hierarchy is defined by elementary fibrils (between 1.5 and 3.5 nm), micro-fibrils (between 10 and 30 nm), and microfibrillar bands (in the order of 100 nm) [25] , which are connected with each other three-dimensionally. The cell walls, composed of these interlaced hierarachical fibrils, are full of the hierarachical holes or apertures. These walls are enclosed to form the lumens, which are one side open with the diameter on the micrometer level. The reported specific area of cotton fibers is in the range of 30\u201355 m 2 g \u22121 [26] . The pores of cellulose have been used as the nano-reactor for the synthesis of nano-noble metal\u2013cellulose composite by anchoring the metal salts into the pores of the cellulose fiber's structure followed by the reduction with aqueous BaBH 4 [27] . In this study, we took advantage of the porous sturcture of cotton as the micro-bioreactor to integrate with a fast combustion (glycine-nitrate, GN) reaction for the synthesis of nano-crystalline composite oxides. The fast combustion reaction was conducted inside the pores and lumens of the cellulose fibers. The cellulose fiber was then gently burned out after the GN auto-combustion, with the help of the heat released by the GN combustion process. The constricted-space reaction not only effectively suppressed the aggregation of the composite oxides, but also provided a channel for the gas emission; therefore no products sprayed out from the reaction vessel during the synthesis. 2 Experimental details 2.1 Synthesis The de-waxed cotton fiber was applied as the micro-bioreactor. It was immersed in 67 wt.% concentrated nitric acid for a certain time, and then washed with deionized water to remove the HNO 3 and dried at \u223c100 \u00b0C to form the activated cellulose fiber. The synthesis of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF), Sm 2 O 3 -doped CeO 2 (SDC), Gd 2 O 3 -doped CeO 2 (GDC) and NiO (65 wt.%)\u2013GDC, the widely applied electrode or electrolyte materials in intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), were investigated in this study. The synthesis of LSCF is described as an example as follows. Stoichiometric amounts of La(NO 3 ) 3 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 were first mixed in the same solution, followed by the introduction of glycine (mole ratio of glycine:total metal ions = 2:1) as the fuel. The mixed solution was then heated at 80 \u00b0C to form a sol, into which the activated cellulose was then carefully dropped and slowly soaked. After the drying process at 80 \u00b0C for several hours, the precursor was then heated at 250 \u00b0C in an oven to trigger the auto combustion. Fluffy SDC, GDC, or LSCF was finally obtained which had the morphological shape of the initial cellulose fiber and could easily be ground to fine powders. The synthesized powders were un-axially pressed into green disks under a hydraulic pressure of 400 MPa with a 15 mm-diameter stainless steel mold. A sintering temperature of 1350 \u00b0C with a dwell time of 300 min was applied for the densification of SDC at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . 2.2 Characterization The crystal structures of the synthesized powders were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning in the range of 10\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 90\u00b0. The crystalline size was calculated based on the Scherrer equation from the study of the Bragg angle and half bandwidth at the index peak of (1 1 1) or (1 1 0) plane for SDC/GDC or LSCF, respectively. The particle size of the derived powder was also examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-200CX). Thermogravimetry\u2013differential thermal analysis (TG\u2013DTA) was performed using a NETZSCH STA 409 PC in the range of 25\u20131100 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 in flowing air. Morphologies of the cellulose and cellulose\u2013GN precursors were observed using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). Morphologies of the sintered disks were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, LEO1530). The specific surface area of the samples was characterized by N 2 adsorption using a BELSORP II instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were put in vacuum at 200 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 h to remove the surface adsorbed species. 3 Results and discussion After the evaporation of water, the glycine-nitrate (GN) solution converted to a sticky sol-type precursor, while it was in the solid state when cellulose was applied. The above phenomena suggest that certain types of interaction between cellulose and GN might exist. Based on the literature results, it is likely that the hydroxyl groups ( OH) in cellulose's structure successfully anchored the GN complex to the cellulose surface via the formation of a certain type of metal\u2013oxygen bonds [28\u201331] . After the impregantion of GN, the cellulose\u2013GN precursor still took the geometric morphology of cotton fiber as observed by bare eyes. Fig. 2 shows the SEM morphologies of the pure cellulose and the GN-impregnated celluloses at various GN-to-cellulose ratios. The dry activated cotton fiber was in a twisted flat tubular shape, while the cotton fiber became round and robust after the impregnation by GN. It suggests that the GN successfully soaked into the pores and lumens of the cotton fiber. However, GN was also observed between the gaps of the cotton fibers when 0.5\u20131.5 g cellulose was applied during the synthesis of 0.005 mol LSCF (0.01 mol GN). It suggested that the amount of GN applied was beyond the adsorption capability of the pores and lumens of the cellulose. The higher the GN-to-cellulose ratio, the more GN was observed between the gaps of cotton fibers. No GN was observed between the cotton fibers\u2019 gap when the amount of cellulose was increased to 2.0 g. Therefore the saturated adsorption capability for the pores and lumens of the cellulose was around 0.005 mol GN per gram of cellulose. The as-prepared solid precursors with various GN-to-cellulose ratios were then put into a heated oven at 250 \u00b0C for the initiation of the combustion reaction. The combustion processes of the conventional GN and cellulose\u2013GN in the synthesis of LSCF were examined with a digital camera. As shown in Fig. 3 A , the GN combustion reaction was very vagarious and fast, lasting for only \u223c1 s. The sudden combustion reaction formed a huge amount of gaseous products, which blew the oxides formed in situ in the reaction vessel (beaker) away to the environment, while the combustion process of the cellulose\u2013GN was much milder ( Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, as compared with the yellow flame in the GN process, the wine color of the cellulose\u2013GN flame indicated that the combustion temperature was lower than that of the GN process. The cellulose\u2013GN combustion lasted \u223c0.5\u20133 min depending on the amount of cellulose applied. The more cellulose was applied, the longer the combustion time lasted. The derived products took the morphology of the initial cellulose fiber without products spraying out when sufficient amount of cellulose was applied, while the spray could also happen when the excessive amount of GN was not able to soak into the cellulose structure due to the insufficient amount of cellulose applied. It suggests the importance of the reaction within the pores in preventing the formation of smog and ash. The combustion behavior of the GN and the cellulose\u2013GN precursor was further investigated in more detail by the TG\u2013DTA analysis in air. As shown in Fig. 4 a , the combustion process of activated cellulose was relatively gentle with the weight loss starting at a temperature of \u223c200 \u00b0C and completing at a temperature of \u223c500 \u00b0C. The combustion process was mainly composed of three successive steps, including a weight loss of about 30% accompanied by a small exothermal peak in DTA profile within the temperature range of 200\u2013300 \u00b0C, a weight loss of about 50% between 300 and 350 \u00b0C accompanied by a large exothermal peak at around 330 \u00b0C, and a gentle weight loss process between 350 and 500 \u00b0C accompanied by a large broad exothermal peaks in DTA profile at 459 \u00b0C. On the contrary, the reaction of the conventional GN combustion was really vigorous. After the sudden triggering of the reaction at a temperature of \u223c180 \u00b0C, a huge amount of gases was produced. The gases blew the powder out of the crucible and resulted in the failure of the TG experiment and loss of data. By comparison, although the products of the cellulose\u2013GN precursor could also spill from the TG crucible sometimes, especially at higher GN-to-cellulose ratios, the reaction process was much milder comparing with GN process. Fig. 4 b shows the typical TG\u2013DTA profile of a cellulose\u2013GN precursor. The reaction started at a temperature of \u223c185 \u00b0C accompanied by a large exothermal peak. Based on the TG\u2013DTA profile, the combustion process lasted \u223c2.5 min, which agreed well with the previous experimental observation for the cellulose\u2013GN combustion. A more detailed study of the DTA profile of the cellulose\u2013GN combustion process revealed that the exothermal peak was actually a combination of two successive exothermal peaks, one around 195 \u00b0C and the other around 203 \u00b0C. Based on our TG experiment and literature results [32] , the exothermal peak around 195 \u00b0C was ascribed to the GN combustion reaction. The huge amount of heat produced from the GN reaction triggered the combustion of cellulose. Since cellulose was suddenly heated to a high temperature by the GN reaction, the combustion behavior of cellulose was thus different from that observed in the TG\u2013DTA experiment shown in Fig. 4 a, in which the cellulose was slowly heated up from room temperature to the high temperature. Therefore, the combustion of cellulose just displayed a single exothermal peak in the DTA of the cellulose\u2013GN precursor. Theoretically, CO 2 , H 2 O and N 2 are the most stable products during the combustion. The synthesis of composite oxides, for example SDC by the cellulose\u2013GN process, can be expressed by the following equation: (a) (C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n + 20C 2 H 5 NO 2 + 8Ce(NO 3 ) 3 + 2Sm(NO 3 ) 3 + (12 n + 19)/2O 2 \u2192 8CeO 2 + Sm 2 O 3 + 25N 2 + (5 n + 50)H 2 O + (6 n + 40)CO 2 + Q The highly exothermal nature of the above reaction creates a high temperature and ensures the SDC phase formation. The maximum temperature reached during the auto-combustion process can be calculated based on the adiabatic combustion model. The available thermodynamic data in literature for various reactants and products, as presented in Table 1 , was used in the calculation. The thermodynamic data of SDC is not available in literature; therefore as an approximation, we substituted it by Sm 2 O 3 and CeO 2 with a proportion of 1:8. The molecular formula used for cellulose was (C 6 H 10 O 5 ) n . In the calculation, we assumed n = 0, 5, 10, 20 or 50. The reaction accounts to the normal GN combustion at the condition of n = 0. The adiabatic temperatures can be calculated by (1) \u0394 H + \u222b T 1 T 2 \u2211 n C p \u2009 d T = 0 where T 1 (298 K) and T 2 are, respectively, the initial and terminal temperatures of the reaction, n the stoichiometric ratio of corresponding phase in reaction, \u0394 H is the enthalpy increment of system over the interval of temperature from T 1 to T 2 under the constraint of constant pressure and expressed by (2) \u0394 H = H 2 \u2212 H 1 where H 2 and H 1 are the enthalpies summation of productions and reagents at 298 K. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of gases is complicated; however, if the temperature range is restricted, the heat capacity ( C p ) of any phase may be represented adequately by the experimental expression as: (3) C p = a + b T + c T 2 The heat capacity of solid-state metal oxides is not greatly influenced by temperature and therefore it is considered as a constant in the temperature range in current study. The units for a , b and c are J mol \u22121 K \u22121 , J mol \u22121 K \u22122 and J mol \u22121 K \u22123 , respectively. The calculated adiabatic temperatures at various conditions are shown in Fig. 5 , which indicate that the adiabatic temperature decreases with increasing the GN-to-cellulose ratio. The increase in the cellulose percentage can result in a reduction of the combustion temperature, which would be beneficial for suppressing the grain growth of the products. Since the cellulose was combusted after the GDC formation (GN reaction), as demonstrated by the TG\u2013DTA results, its fiber structure effectively prevented the contact of the oxide particles, hence successfully suppressing their grain growth. Since the relatively long combustion time, the temperature reached by the cellulose combustion process was much lower than the GN combustion; therefore, the grain growth of the oxides during the combustive removal of cellulose was not significant. The gas emission in the combustion would contribute to limiting the inter-particle connects [33] . According to the above analysis, a fine particle size of the composite oxides would result based on the current cellulose\u2013GN process. Since the GN reaction is considerably vigorous, constraining this process to such a micro-bioreactor would very likely lead to an explosion. Interestingly, however, such a vagarious reaction did not lead to the spill of the resulted powders from the reactor throughout the synthesis. This can be attributed to two possible reasons. First of all, the multilevel pores and the crown ether effect of oxygen-rich natural carbohydrate in cellulose can not only immobilize the cations over the cellulose surface via anchoring, but also constrict the resulted oxides powders in the small pores [27] ; secondly, bigger pores can serve as the channels for the migration of gaseous products. On the other hand, the combustion characteristics of cellulose\u2013GN precursor also played a critical role. Obviously, if the cellulose had burnt off before the GN reaction, the porous structure of cellulose would not have worked. The above conclusions are supported by the TEM observations. As shown in Fig. 6 A , the as-prepared SDC kept the cellulose-like porous structure, which indicated that the cellulose held the in situ formed SDC powders firmly and the gaseous products could not break up the cellulose network during the GN combustion process. As shown in Fig. 6 B, SDC particles with a grain size of only \u223c10 nm and a narrow particle size distribution were obtained after the combustion. The small particle size can be attributed to the blocking between particles by the cellulose, and the reduced temperature. The properties of the derived powders were further investigated by XRD, BET, etc. The XRD patterns of SDC, GDC and LSCF are shown in Fig. 7 and the crystalline sizes calculated by the Scherrer equation are listed in Table 2 . The SDC and GDC powders were obtained without any other phases observed based on the XRD results ( Fig. 7 A and B). As compared with the GN method this novel micro-bioreactor allows the crystalline sizes of SDC and GDC to decrease as the cellulose addition amount increases. The crystalline size is 9.0 nm for the SDC sample with 2.0 g of cellulose applied in the synthesis of 0.01 mol SDC, which was consistent with the result from TEM, and the calculated value of 15 nm was based on the BET area assuming a spherical shape of the particles. In the case of LSCF, a small amount of SrCO 3 appeared in the sample obtained by the conventional GN process ( Fig. 7 C). When 0.5 or 1.0 g of cellulose was applied as the bioreactor, this phase could still be observed. It demonstrated that the introduction of cellulose as the micro-reactor did not improve the homogeneity of the reactants. A further increase in the cellulose amount, however, resulted in the appearance of a new phase, K 2 NiF 4 -structure La x Sr 2\u2212 x CoO 4 (JCPDS card 34-1296). The new phase might be caused by the reduction characteristic of carbon derived from the cellulose in situ. It is worth noting that the crystallite sizes of LSCF first increased with the cellulose addition amount up to 1.0 g, and then decreased to 15 or 17 nm at the cellulose addition amount of 1.5 or 2.0 g, respectively. The disordered change of the crystallite sizes was probably caused by the in situ formed impurities during the synthesis process, such as SrCO 3 and La x Sr 2\u2212 x CoO 4 , which might block or enhance the growth of the crystallite. The specific surface area for SDC powders derived from the precursor using 2.0 g of cellulose is 59 m 2 g \u22121 , which is comparable to the results from the complicated sol\u2013gel process, while it is about 157% higher than that prepared by a conventional GN process (23 m 2 g \u22121 ). The higher specific area also leads to a higher surface energy, which is beneficial to sintering. The SDC green disks were fired at 1350 \u00b0C for 300 min to obtain the sintered pellets (shown in Fig. 8 ), while in the case of SDC derived from the conventional GN process the temperature must be 1450 \u00b0C or higher for its densification. A dense sintered body with no observable penetrating holes was obtained with the grain sizes in the range of 1.0\u20132.5 \u03bcm and a mean grain size of around 2.0 \u03bcm. To investigate the capability of the cellulose\u2013GN process for large-scale synthesis, the process was also tested on the synthesis of 20 g NiO (65 wt.%)\u2013GDC, a typical anode material for IT-SOFCs. The reaction was also gentle without any products spilling from the reaction vessel during the combustion process. The phases composition for the resulted powders as shown in Fig. 9 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction to be the right mixture of GDC and NiO. This implies that we can escalate the scale for powder preparation by simply increasing the amount of reagents and the content of vessel. Additionally, the yield of 9.5 million tonnes per year makes cotton a sustainable source for this application. 4 Conclusions Cellulose was applied as a micro-bioreactor and integrated with a fast combustion reaction, i.e., GN process, to synthesize various types of nano-structured composite oxides. As compared with the conventional GN combustion method, this novel process allows the preparation process to be more environmental-friendly. Furthermore, the particle size of the powders obtained could be smaller, attributing to the blocking effect of cellulose in suppressing the particle contact during the synthesis. By this innovative method, an SDC powder with a particle size as small as \u223c10 nm was obtained, which can be easily sintered to dense electrolyte at 1350 \u00b0C. The process is also capable for large-scale synthesis.

        "abstract": "In this work, the effects of sintering temperature on the phase structure, oxygen nonstoichiometry, microstructure, electrical conductivity, and oxygen permeation behavior of perovskite La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-\u03b4 membranes were systematically studied. The sintering temperature has negligible effect on the bulk properties of the phase structure and the oxygen nonstoichiometry, but has significant influence on the microstructure and electrical conductivity of the membranes, and therefore imposes large impact on its oxygen permeability. With an increase in the sintering temperature, the grain size increased steadily from 0.3 \u03bcm at 1000 \u00b0C to 3.5 \u03bcm at 1300 \u00b0C, accompanied with the substantial enhancement of electrical conductivity but the decrease of activation energy for the electrical conduction. Results indicate that the grain boundary had a much lower electrical conductivity than that of the bulk. The oxygen permeation process was mainly rate-determined by the slow oxygen diffusion over the grain boundary. Higher sintering temperature lowers the activation energy for oxygen permeation and accordingly gives rise to higher oxygen permeation flux. The oxygen permeation flux could be improved more than 10 times if the sintering temperature increased from 1000 to 1300 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) perovskite was investigated as a cathode material for low temperature solid-oxide fuel cell. The material showed an almost linear thermal expansion from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C in air with the average thermal expansion coefficient of only 16.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 . The Sc-doping made the absence of Co 4+ in SSC, which resulted in not only dramatically reduced thermal expansion coefficient but also extremely high oxygen vacancies concentrations in the lattice at low temperature. The area specific polarization resistance was 0.206 \u03a9 cm 2 for SSC at 550 \u00b0C, which is about 52% lower than the value of a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 -based cathode. A peak power density as high as 564 mW cm \u22122 was obtained at 500 \u00b0C based on a 20 \u03bcm thick Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 electrolyte by adopting SSC cathode. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Cathode Perovskite Thermal expansion SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 1 Introduction Recent solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development has focused on low temperature operation (400\u2013600 \u00b0C) primarily to facilitate the use of low-cost metallic interconnects, to decrease materials demands for seals and balance-of-plant components, and to improve long-term cell stability [1] . A major concern with reduced operating temperatures is the deterioration of electrochemical activity of the cathode for oxygen reduction, and hence reduced cell performance. It is generally accepted that an ideal SOFC cathode should possess high electronic and ionic conductivity in addition to high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction at the desired operating temperatures. Several perovskite compounds with cobalt as the predominant B-site cation satisfy these requirements [2\u20134] . However, cobalt-rich compositions have high thermal expansion coefficients (TECs), and there is concern with respect to delamination of the cathode from the electrolyte on thermal cycling [5] . Some cobalt-free alternatives have been developed as the cathodes, such as (La,Sr)FeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and La(Ni,Fe)O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , which have closer TEC to the electrolyte, but they suffer from unfavorable electrocatalysis on oxygen reduction reaction at the reduced operating temperatures [6,7] . Some researches showed that the partial substitution of cobalt could reduce the TECs of the cobalt-containing materials to some extent by depressing the oxidation of cobalt ion from Co 3+ to Co 4+ [8,9] . However, further reducing the TECs of the materials by decreasing the cobalt content led to a steady increase in cathodic resistance to oxygen reduction reaction. Therefore, a key issue is to exploit a cobalt-containing material with low TEC but maintaining high electrocatalysis at low operating temperatures. Among the cobalt-containing materials, the family of Sr\u2013Co\u2013O system oxides has both the high oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity when they are in cubic crystal structure. Zeng et al. reported that Sc-doping in cobalt position in SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides stabilized the cubic structure in a wide range of temperatures [10] . In addition, it was reported that the introduction of small amount of Sc 3+ likely led to the stabilization the cobalt ion at the lower valence state and/or the high spin state. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the TEC of the materials can be reduced by the Sc-doping. In this preliminary work, the thermal expansion and electrochemical properties of SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) cathode are studied based on a Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) electrolyte. Excellent cathode performance at reduced temperatures was reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis and cell fabrication SSC and SDC powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process according to Ref. [10] . The SSC cathode powder was dispersed in a premixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol, and a colloidal suspension was formed via high-energy ball milling (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6) at 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The resulting slurry was painted onto both surfaces of the SDC pellet in symmetric configuration and subsequently calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The porosity of the cathode was \u223c35%. The performance of SSC cathode was also evaluated in an anode-supported fuel cell. Ni + SDC mixture was used as the anode and SDC was used as the electrolyte with a thickness of 20 \u03bcm. A three-electrode system was used to get the cathodic overpotential-current density curves. The SSC slurry was painted on one side of the SDC electrolyte to form an electrode area of 0.26 cm 2 to act as working electrode (WE). Silver paste was painted on the other side of the SDC pellet in symmetry to WE as the counter electrode (CE). The reference electrode was painted as a ring surrounding the CE. 2.2 Electrochemical characterization The I \u2013 V polarization of the cells was measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter. H 2 fuel was fed into the anode chamber at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP], and ambient air was served as the oxidant gas. The electrochemical impedance spectra of the cathode were investigated via an ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The applied frequency range was from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and the signal amplitude was 10 mV under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions. Cathodic overpotential was measured using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat. The IR drop, originating from the electrolyte and lead/contact resistances, was compensated for by using the series resistance obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, to establish the IR-free I / E characteristics. 2.3 Other characterization A bar with the dimensions of 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm was sintered at 1100 \u00b0C in air for TECs test. TECs were measured using a Netsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C with an air-purge flow rate of 50 ml min \u22121 . Thermogravimetry (TG) analyses were performed (Model STA 409, NETZSCH) in the range of 25\u2013950 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 , carried out in flowing air. Oxygen nonstoichiometry (d) and a mean valence of B-site cations (n) in the samples were evaluated by iodometry as described in Ref. [11] . 3 Results and discussion It was reported that, when Fe and/or Ni were used to substitute the cobalt in B-site, only at the cobalt content lower than \u223c34%, the TECs of the materials could be reduced to <17.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 [5] . However, the low cobalt concentration is not beneficial to get a favorable electrochemical performance at low operating temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermal expansion behavior of SSC. The sample exhibited almost linear thermal expansion from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C and the average TEC is about 16.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 . This suggests that the Sc-doping is more efficient to reduce the material\u2019s TEC as compared with Fe and Ni. According to the d\u0394 L / L 0 vs. temperature curve, we can confirm that only a mild inflection occurred at \u223c625 \u00b0C. Some researches showed that the cobalt-containing perovskite oxides have two inflections at the temperatures of around 400 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C, which can be ascribed to the changes of valence state of the cobalt ions from Co 4+ to Co 3+ and Co 3+ to Co 2+ , respectively [12] . The low temperature inflection can not be observed in SSC, which suggests the absence of Co 4+ in SSC. The room temperature average valence state of the cobalt in SSC was determined by the iodometry method and its value is 2.88. It is believed that the low valence state of cobalt lowered the TEC of SSC. Fig. 2 shows the thermal analysis for SSC carried out in air. The TG curve of SSC began to show an obvious weight loss at \u223c610 \u00b0C. The oxygen release originating from the reduction of cobalt ions resulted in this weight loss. The dependence of oxygen nonstoichiometry, \u03b4 , on the temperature is also shown in Fig. 2 . The oxygen nonstoichiometry reached as high as 0.548 at room temperature and kept almost constant at a temperature lower than 610 \u00b0C, and then it increased steadily with further increasing the temperature. The high amount of oxygen vacancies existing in SSC at room temperature is beneficial for the oxygen reduction reaction. All these results also reflect the fact that the Co 4+ was absent in SSC. Fig. 3 shows the area specific polarization resistances (ASRs) of SSC at various temperatures. The ASR is 0.044 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 \u00b0C. The value is slightly higher than that of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) (0.040 \u03a9 cm 2 ) tested in our previous study also shown in Fig. 3 for comparison. As the temperature decreases, however, the ASRs of SSC increased slower than those of BSCF. The ASR is only 0.206 \u03a9 cm 2 for SSC at 550 \u00b0C, which is about 52% lower than that for BSCF [11] . The activation energy for oxygen reduction on SSC cathode is 100 kJ mol \u22121 , which is also lower than 116 kJ mol \u22121 for BSCF [2] . This means that the SSC is a more suitable cathode for SOFC operated at low temperature rather than the BSCF. Cathode overpotential is an important factor representing the electrode performance. Typical overpotential curves for SSC cathode as a function of current density are shown in Fig. 4 . As expected, the cathode overpotential decreased with temperature, indicating that the catalysis property was improved with the increase of temperature. The polarization overpotential was only \u2212110 mV for SSC cathode at the current densities of \u22121070, \u2212557, \u2212185 and \u221253 mA cm \u22122 at 600, 550, 500 and 450 \u00b0C in air, respectively. The high current densities imply that the good fuel cell performances would be obtained at lower temperatures. A complete cell with a 20 \u03bcm thick SDC electrolyte and a SDC\u2013Ni (50/50 vol.%) anode was subjected for I \u2013 V characterization. Fig. 5 shows the cell voltages and power densities at various temperatures. The maximum power density ( P max ) reached 902 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C, which is comparable to those obtained from the cells based on advanced cathodes operated on the same conditions [2,13] . When the cell worked at the operating temperatures lower than 600 \u00b0C, the values were significantly higher than those reported for SDC electrolyte fuel cells. For example, the P max was 564 mW cm \u22122 at 500 \u00b0C, which is even \u223c40% higher than that based on BSCF cathode [2] . It should be mentioned that the OCVs were lower than the theoretical values, which should result from the reduction of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ in the electrolyte. Fortunately, it was reported that both the OCVs and electrochemical performances can be improved by using a thin BaCe 1\u2212 x Sm x O 3\u2212 d interlayer between the cathode and electrolyte [14] . 4 Conclusions The novel SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) perovskite shows an average TEC of only 16.9 \u00d7 10 \u22121 K \u22121 in air. The Sc-doping resulted in not only dramatically reduced thermal expansion behavior, but also extremely high oxygen vacancy concentrations in lattice at low temperatures. The ASR of SSC cathode is about 52% lower than the value of a BSCF-based cathode at 550 \u00b0C. A peak power density reaches as high as 564 mW cm \u22122 at 500 \u00b0C based on a 20 \u03bcm thick SDC electrolyte.

        "abstract": "The initialization of an anode-supported single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell, with NiO + Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 anode and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 + Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 cathode, was investigated. The initialization process had significant impact on the observed performance of the fuel cell. The in situ reduction of the anode by a methane\u2013air mixture failed. Although pure methane did reduce the nickel oxide, it also resulted in severe carbon coking over the anode and serious distortion of the fuel cell. In situ initialization by hydrogen led to simultaneous reduction of both the anode and cathode; however, the cell still delivered a maximum power density of \u223c350 mW cm \u22122 , attributed to the re-formation of the BSCF phase under the methane\u2013air atmosphere at high temperatures. The ex situ reduction method appeared to be the most promising. The activated fuel cell showed a peak power density of \u223c570 mW cm \u22122 at a furnace temperature of 600 \u00b0C, with the main polarization resistance contributed from the electrolyte. Keywords Single chamber Solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Methane 1 Introduction Fuel cell technology is reputed for its high-energy efficiency, favorable power density and extremely low emissions [1,2] . In association with the hydrogen economy, it has been strongly promoted during the past decades by the governments of most of the world's leading industrialized nations. Amongst the many types of fuel cells, the Solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is of particular interest for its high fuel flexibility. In addition to hydrogen, other more stable chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and propane) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol) can also serve as potential fuels [3\u20135] . A typical SOFC is composed of a porous anode and cathode that are sandwiched by a dense electrolyte. In a normal configuration, sealants are applied in order to separate the fuel cell into the fuel and oxidant chambers. The function of the dense solid-oxide electrolyte and sealant is to avoid the direct mixing of the fuel and oxidant, otherwise resulting in a decrease in fuel efficiency due to the non-electrochemical gas-phase combustion of the fuel. Currently, a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) configuration has been proposed, in which the anode and cathode are exposed to a gas mixture of combined fuel and oxidant (air) [6\u201310] . This configuration, characterized by eliminating sealing, greatly improves the fuel cell integrity. This is due to the fact that the thermal cycling stress, which is due to the mismatch of thermal expansion between components in the fuel cell, is significantly reduced. Therefore, the SC-SOFC allows for rapid start up and shut down, which is of particular importance for small-scale power generation [11,12] . Furthermore, the anode and cathode can be deposited onto the same electrolyte surface, which allows for a versatile cell design [13,14] . The basic operating principle of a SC-SOFC surrounds the different catalytic selectivity of the electrodes towards the fuel\u2013oxidant mixture [15,16] . Ideally, the cathode is active only for the electro-catalytic reduction of oxygen, while the anode has high activity for partial oxidation of fuel to syngas (CO + H 2 ) and also for the electro-catalytic oxidation of syngas to water and carbon dioxide. The non-ideal performance of the electrodes would create a mixed potential, which decreases both open circuit voltage (OCV) and fuel efficiency. Recently, methane-fueled SC-SOFCs have received a lot of attention [17\u201325] . Shao and co-workers reported Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 + Sm 0.15 Ce 0.85 O 1.925 (BSCF + SDC) to be an efficient cathode material for methane or propane-fueled SC-SOFCs [26,27] . In addition, the typical SOFC anode component, nickel, was found to be a good catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane to syngas at intermediate temperatures. Under optimized conditions, a peak power density as high as 760 mW cm \u22122 was reported for a thin-film electrolyte fuel cell with a Ni + SDC anode and a BSCF + SDC (70:30 wt.%) cathode operated on a methane\u2013oxygen\u2013helium stream [28] . The actual electro-catalyst in the SOFC anode is metal nickel; however, there are two obvious advantages of applying NiO instead of metal nickel as the raw material for the fuel cell fabrication. First, such fabrication can be performed in air, which greatly reduces the processing cost; secondly, the reduction of nickel oxide to nickel can introduce pores into the anode layer, which facilitates the gas diffusion. The SOFC initialization, which mainly involves the reduction of nickel oxide to nickel in the anode, then becomes an important step of the fuel cell application. In situ reduction is usually adopted for dual-chamber SOFCs since the cathode environment is independent from the anode if the sealing is perfect. The situation for the SC-SOFC is much more complicated due to the fact that the anode and cathode are exposed to the same atmosphere. Especially for the cobalt-based cathode, the proper initialization procedure is critical in order to ensure high fuel cell performance. In this paper, the initialization of a methane-fueled SC-SOFC with a NiO + SDC anode and a BSCF + SDC cathode will be systematically investigated. The different initialization processes were found to have significant impact on the SC-SOFC performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Fuel cell fabrication The fuel cell employed in this study was in an anode-supported thin-film electrolyte configuration with a NiO + SDC anode (\u223c600 \u03bcm), SDC electrolyte (20\u201330 \u03bcm) and a BSCF + SDC (70:30 wt.%) cathode (10\u201320 \u03bcm). All of the fuel cell materials, except for the NiO (Chengdu Shudu Nanomaterials Technology Development Co. Ltd.), were synthesized using the standard combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process, with metal nitrates (analytical reagents) applied as the raw materials for the metal sources. Please refer to previous publications for information regarding the detailed procedure of the preparation process [29,30] . A dry-pressing/sintering method was adopted in order to fabricate the anode-supported SDC bi-layer pellets. These green dual-layer pellets resulting from dry pressing were fired at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air, in order to achieve the densification of the electrolyte layer and the firm connection between the dual layers. The cathode powders (BSCF + SDC) were first dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension through high-energy ball milling (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6), at the rotational speed of 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The resulting slurry was painted on the electrolyte surface of the fresh or pre-reduced dual-layer membranes, then calcined at 950 \u00b0C for 2 h in air (or under flowing nitrogen atmosphere for the cells with pre-reduced anode) to obtain three-layered single cells. The resulting coin-shaped cathode had an effective geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 . 2.2 Fuel cell performance test Four types of operational modes were exploited: (1) in situ reduction of the anode by methane\u2013air mixed gas; (2) in situ activation by pure methane; (3) in situ initialization by hydrogen; (4) pre-reduction of the anode before the deposition of the cathode layer. The single-chamber reactor, applied for the fuel cell performance test, is schematically shown in Fig. 1 . It is comprised of two quartz tubes. The outer tube has an inner diameter of \u223c18 mm, while the inner tube has an outer diameter of \u223c10 mm. The top of the inner tube was enlarged to a size of \u223c14 mm (inner diameter) for holding the fuel cell. An electrical furnace was utilized for heating the fuel cell. Methane and air were controlled through using mass flow controllers. The methane or methane\u2013air mixture was then introduced to the reactor through the small tube. The effluent gas escaped from the reactor through the gap between the inner and outer tube. Once the fuel cell was initialized, the methane\u2013air gas mixture was turned on. I\u2013V polarization curves were then collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-terminal configuration. Ag paste, instead of platinum paste, was adopted as the current collector since Pt is catalytically active for methane partial oxidation. 2.3 Catalytic activity test The catalytic activity of the anode or cathode materials for the methane\u2013air conversion was evaluated in a flow-through fixed bed reactor, which is composed of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of \u223c8 mm. About 0.1 g of catalyst (anode or cathode powder with \u223c80 mesh grain size) was put in the center of the reactor, and a K-type thermocouple was immersed into the catalyst bed with the protection of a small quartz tube to avoid catalytic contribution to the methane conversion. A tube furnace was applied to sustain the temperature required for the reaction. Methane\u2013air mixed gas was introduced from the top of the reactor. The effluent gas from the bottom of the reactor was introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, which was equipped with a Poraplot Q and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve capillary columns for the separation of H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 . Before introduction into the reactor, water was adsorbed by a cooling trap. The methane and oxygen conversions were calculated based on % \u2009 conversio n C H 4 = [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] outlet 100 \u2003 \u2003 % \u2009 conversio n O 2 = ( 1 / 2 ) [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + ( 1 / 2 ) [ H 2 O ] ( 1 / 2 ) [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + ( 1 / 2 ) [ H 2 O ] + [ O 2 ] outlet 100 And the CO and CO 2 selectivity was calculated based on % \u2009 selectivit y C O 2 = [ C O 2 ] [ CO + C O 2 ] 100 \u2003 \u2003 % \u2009 selectivit y CO = [ CO ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] 100 2.4 Characterization X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) was used to analyze chemical compatibilities against high temperature and stability against reducing atmosphere. The microscopic features and element compositions of the electrodes were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) attachment. The electrode performance was investigated with complete cell configuration by the ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation based on the Solartron 1287 potentiostat in combination with a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer. The frequency range applied was from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with signal amplitude of 10 mV under OCV conditions. The overall impedance data were fitted by a complex nonlinear least squares (CNLSs) fitting program in Z-View 2.9b software. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Initialization by methane and air mixed gas Because the SC-SOFC in this study operates on a methane\u2013air mixture, the most practical approach to fuel cell initialization is the through the application of the same mixed gas or through using pure methane as the reduction gas. Shao et al. have demonstrated that the highest performance for a SC-SOFC with similar cell components to those in this study was achieved at the methane to oxygen ratio of \u223c1:1 [28] . Therefore a methane\u2013air mixture with the same methane to oxygen ratio was investigated in this study for the initialization of the fuel cell at 800 \u00b0C (methane to air ratio of 90:380). During the initialization process the OCV of the fuel cell was in situ monitored. Once the anode was successfully reduced, the resulting nickel metal would catalyze the partial oxidation of methane to syngas and then create a significant decrease in the oxygen partial pressure over the anode surface. Consequently, a large OCV should be observed due to the large oxygen potential difference between the anode and cathode surfaces. As shown in Fig. 2 , a steady increase of the OCV was observed over time. However, the cell voltage increased very slowly from an initial value of \u22120.006\u20130.007 V after about 6.5 h on stream. This suggests that the initialization was actually unsuccessful. After the treatment, the fuel cell maintained perfect geometric integrity with no carbon deposition detected over both the cathode and anode surfaces. The room-temperature conductivity was so low that it was out of the range of the multimeter. XRD patterns of the anode, before and after the treatment of the fuel cell by CH 4 + air mixed gas, are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the nickel in the anode still took the oxidation state of NiO after the treatment. Whether or not the anode can be successfully activated by the methane\u2013air mixed gas during the in situ initialization process is closely related to the catalytic activity of the NiO + SDC anode towards the gas mixture. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of methane/oxygen conversions and CO/CO 2 selectivity over the unreduced NiO + SDC anode catalyst between 550 and 850 \u00b0C. It was observed that NiO + SDC had medium catalytic activity for methane deep oxidation to CO 2 and H 2 O. At 800 \u00b0C, the oxygen and methane conversions reached \u223c99.8 and \u223c50%, respectively. The chemical stability of NiO and Ni depends on both the temperature and the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere. The equilibrium oxygen partial pressure for the reaction NiO \u2194 Ni + 1/2O 2 (g) is around 9.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 atm at 800 \u00b0C [31] . This means that thermodynamically nickel oxide can be reduced to Ni metal only at P O 2 < 9.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 atm at 800 \u00b0C. The actual oxygen partial pressure over the NiO + SDC surface, which was calculated based on the unreacted oxygen, reached \u223c10 \u22125 atm. Such high oxygen partial pressure, which was previously related to the poor activity of NiO + SDC for oxygen conversion, accounts for the unsuccessful activation of the anode, i.e., the reduction of NiO to Ni, by applying the methane\u2013air mixture as the reduction gas. 3.2 In situ reduction of anode by pure methane Considering the high oxygen partial pressure of the anode atmosphere by applying methane\u2013air mixture as the initialization gas, pure methane, a more reducing gas, was investigated for in situ reduction of SC-SOFC anode. After the fuel cell was treated with methane at 800 \u00b0C for \u223c400 min, the methane\u2013air mixed gas was turned on and the time dependence of OCV was recorded. Near zero OCV was also observed. This suggests that the initialization of the fuel cell by pure methane also failed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements demonstrate that the fuel cell had an area specific bulk resistance of less than 0.6 \u03a9 cm 2 at 800 \u00b0. Therefore, the anode was actually successfully reduced after the methane treatment. However, the fuel cell was badly distorted and swelled significantly with a cell diameter increase of more than 40%. Shown in Fig. 5 are the XRD patterns of the anode after the in situ reduction by methane. Only metal nickel and SDC phases were detected, which further supports that the successful reduction of the anode was achieved. The surface morphologies of the anode and cathode before and after the methane treatment were examined by SEM. When compared to the fresh anode ( Fig. 6 A ), it could be seen that the porosity of the anode after the treatment was significantly increased ( Fig. 6 B). On the other hand, large amounts of carbon fibers were observed inside the anode layer. Their formation was closely related to the high catalytic activity of nickel for methane cracking [32,33] . Significant carbon formation was supported by the EDX detection as shown in Fig. 6 C. Although the EDX is not a perfect tool for the detection of carbon contents due to the easy carbon contamination during the sample preparation process, especially for quantitatively determination of the carbon content. However, through careful management, it can still be applicable to determine carbon qualitatively. During the sample preparation, we take care to avoid the carbon contamination to the maximum degree. Furthermore we conducted the EDX examination for the hydrogen reduced sample in parallel. The EDX result of the hydrogen-reduced sample showed only weak carbon peak ( Fig. 6 D). It suggests that the carbon contamination during the sample preparation is small. As compared to the hydrogen reduced anode, the carbon peak of the methane reduced anode is in much higher intensity (more than 200 times in peak height). Since they were prepared in parallel for the EDX examination, the carbon from the source of contamination should be comparable for the two samples. Therefore, the carbon peak in the EDX profile of the methane reduced anode is mainly contributed from the formed carbon, instead of contamination. The carbon coking resulted in severe cell distortion and expansion as well as the detachment of the cathode from electrolyte surface. Fig. 7 A and B is the SEM photos of the cathode before and after the methane treatment. No carbon coking was observed over the cathode layer after the methane treatment. However, its grain size reduced significantly when compared to the new cathode. The significant distortion of the fuel cell and the detachment of the cathode from the electrolyte then accounts for the failure of the fuel cell's initialization with methane as the reducing agent. 3.3 In situ reduction with hydrogen In order to prevent carbon coking over the anode by applying methane as the reduction gas for the fuel cell initialization, the in situ reduction of the anode by hydrogen was then tried. Once the fuel cell temperature reached 600 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere, the atmosphere was switched to hydrogen with its flow direction parallel to the electrode surfaces. After the fuel cell temperature was dwelled at 600 \u00b0C under the hydrogen atmosphere for 30 min, the methane\u2013air mixture was the turned on and an instant response of the OCV was recorded. As shown in Fig. 8 , the fuel cell envisaged a sharp increase of the OCV to around 0.6 V within the first 15 min, and then slowly increased to \u223c0.7 V after an equilibrium time of about 50 min. This suggests that the in situ reduction of the anode in a single-chamber configuration might be practically feasible. Fig. 9 shows the steady state I\u2013V curves of the fuel cell at a furnace temperature of 575\u2013700 \u00b0C after initialized by in situ hydrogen reduction. Within the investigated furnace temperature range of 575\u2013700 \u00b0C, it was observed that higher operation temperatures resulted in lower OCV. The fuel cell delivered a promising power density of \u223c325 mW cm \u22122 at a furnace temperature of 575 \u00b0C and \u223c350 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. The typical EIS is shown in Fig. 10 . The fuel cell shows a relatively low electrode polarization resistance of \u223c0.21 \u03a9 cm 2 , which is about the same as the electrolyte ohmic drop. No substantial difference in the EIS was observed between different furnace temperatures. The in situ reduction of the anode by hydrogen fuel is the most frequently applied technique for the initialization of a dual-chamber SOFC. Since the anode atmosphere does not reach the cathode in a dual-chamber configuration, the anode reaction typically has no impact on the cathode stability. In the single-chamber configuration, the spontaneous reduction of the cathode by hydrogen could also occur during the anode reduction, since the hydrogen stream sweeps not only the anode but also the cathode. BSCF is intrinsically unstable under hydrogen atmosphere, which was reduced to Co, Fe and BaO/Ba(OH) 2\u00b7 x H 2 O, SrO/(Sr(OH) 2\u00b7 x H 2 O [34] . Fig. 11 shows the XRD diffraction of both anode and cathode after treatment in the hydrogen atmosphere at 600 \u00b0C for 30 min. This demonstrated that the anode was successfully reduced to metal nickel, while the BSCF perovskite phase in the cathode was totally destroyed. The reduction and decomposition products of BSCF formed an amorphous phase. Since cobalt is typically a good catalyst for methane partial oxidation [35,36] , the acquirement of high OCV and power density was somewhat surprising. Fig. 12 shows the catalytic activity of fresh and reduced BSCF towards methane conversion. It is very interesting that the reduced BSCF also showed very poor activity, similar to the fresh BSCF, for the methane deep oxidation and partial oxidation. It is suspected that the iron and BaO/SrO, Ba(OH) 2\u00b7 x H 2 O/Sr(OH) 2\u00b7 x H 2 O phases may reduce the catalytic activity of cobalt for methane partial oxidation. The poor activity resulted in high oxygen partial pressure over the cathode, while the partial oxidation of methane created a highly reducing atmosphere over the reduced anode surface, and consequently a high OCV was observed. It was reported that BSCF has very good phase reversibility capacity. Once the oxidant atmosphere (such as oxygen) can be restored in time, the reduced BSCF could restore its perovskite phase structure under an air atmosphere at high temperatures. Such a unique property was believed to be the cause for the stable operation of the BSCF reactor for the partial oxidation of methane to syngas, in which a highly reducing environment is usually expected at the reaction side [34] . It is likely that the high cathode performance of the in situ activated fuel cell with hydrogen is also closely related with the high phase reversibility of the BSCF oxide. To support this assumption, a pre-reduction/re-oxidation under air + CH 4 atmosphere experiment was conducted. Fig. 13 shows the XRD patterns of the reduced-BSCF oxide after being treated at 800 \u00b0C for various times under a methane\u2013air atmosphere. Thus, the reduced BSCF restored its main peorvskite structure after re-treatment in methane\u2013air atmosphere for 80 min. 3.4 Pre-reduction of the anode by hydrogen before cathode deposition The most ideal initialization process should result in the complete reduction of the anode while not influencing the cathode. Since the anode and cathode are exposed in the same gas chamber, the reduction of the cathode would be unavoidable during the in situ initialization of the fuel cell by hydrogen. An ex situ reduction of the anode was then tried. The anode-supported thin-film electrolyte dual layer was pre-reduced by hydrogen, after the deposition of the cathode layer; the complete cell was fired at 1000 \u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the re-oxidation of the anode. Through the above process, the reduced state of the nickel in the anode and the perovskite structure of the BSCF in the cathode were ensured. The fuel cell was first heated in nitrogen. Once it reached 600 \u00b0C, the mixed methane\u2013air gas was turned on. A quick response of the OCV was observed, suggesting that the partial oxidation over the anode was initialized and stabilized very fast due to being catalyzed by the reduced anode. The fuel cell quickly reached an OCV of \u223c0.75 V, then decreased slightly with time on stream, and finally remained at a steady value of \u223c0.73 V after about 5 min of equilibrium time. The fuel cell performance also improved slightly with time on stream, from an initial peak power density of \u223c500 mW cm \u22122 to a steady value of 570 mW cm \u22122 . Both the increment in fuel cell performance and the decline in OCV were attributed to the elevation of the actual fuel cell temperature due to the partial oxidation/combustion over the anode surface. The oxidation of methane over the fuel cell anode is exothermal in nature, which could result in a fuel cell temperature ten to hundreds degrees higher than the furnace temperature [37,38] . Such an increase not only decreased the electrolyte ohmic resistance but also accelerated the electrode kinetics, which is beneficial for improving the fuel cell performance. However, the elevated temperature also enhanced the non-electrochemical oxidation of methane over the cathode and resulted in a decrease of the OCV. The gas-phase combustion also accounts in part to the decrease of OCV with temperature. Fig. 14 shows I \u2013 V curves of the fuel cells operated at various furnace temperatures. The maximum peak power density of 570 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at a furnace temperature between 575 and 700 \u00b0C. It was much higher than that observed for the fuel cell with the in situ reduced anode by hydrogen at similar operational conditions (350 mW cm \u22122 ). The impedance spectroscopes of the fuel cell were also examined under an OCV condition with the typical EIS shown in Fig. 15 . The fuel cell demonstrates an overwhelming polarization resistance from the electrolyte, which is about three times that of the electrode polarization resistance, including both the anode and cathode. As compared to the OCV of a dual-chamber fuel cell using YSZ electrolyte and syngas as fuel (\u223c1.15 V), the OCV in this study is relatively low, which is mainly contributed from two aspects. Firstly, SDC will not perform as a pure oxygen ionic conductor at the fuel cell operation condition of this study. Since the fuel cell temperature in single-chamber configuration could be several tens to hundreds degree higher than the furnace temperature, the real fuel cell temperature is around 700\u2013800 \u00b0C in this study. At such high temperature, the electronic conductivity of SDC electrolyte is not negligible, which caused internal current short and resulted in lowering OCV. Secondly, the non-ideal performance of anode and cathode towards methane\u2013air mixture caused mixed potential over the electrodes, which then led to additional decrease of the open circuit voltage. 4 Conclusions The performance of the anode-supported SC-SOFC based on a NiO + SDC anode and BSCF + SDC cathode are strongly related to the initialization process. Methane\u2013air mixed gas failed to reduce NiO due to the poor activity of NiO towards methane oxidation. Although successful reduction of NiO was achieved by applying pure methane as the initialization gas, the anode experienced severe carbon deposition, which resulted in the severe distortion of the fuel cell, and consequently zero power was generated from this fuel cell. The initialization of the NiO anode SC-SOFC by in situ reduction with hydrogen was somewhat successful. A peak power density of \u223c325 and 350 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at a furnace temperature of 575 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively, which was closely related to the high phase reversibility of BSCF. The pre-reduction of the anode by hydrogen before cathode deposition was found to be a more suitable method of initialization. With this method, the BSCF can maintain perfect perovskite structure during the anode reduction, which then ensures the high performance of the fuel cell. Under optimized conditions, a peak power density as high as 550\u2013570 mW cm \u22122 was observed at a furnace temperature of 575\u2013600 \u00b0C with a methane\u2013air stream for both the anode and cathode. EIS examination suggests that the electrolyte ohmic drop was the overwhelming resistance for the fuel cell. A decrease of electrolyte thickness would further increase the fuel cell performance. Based on above analysis, it is clear that the reduction of the anode before the cathode deposition is the most suitable method for the initialization of the fuel cell with a Ni + SDC anode and BSCF + SDC cathode operated in a single-chamber configuration with methane\u2013air mixture.

        "abstract": "Composite electrodes composed of a perovskite-type La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSSM) and a fluorite-type scandium-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) were prepared and evaluated as potential cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. Characterization was made by phase reaction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, step current polarization and I \u2013 V tests. The phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ occurred at 1150 \u00b0C or higher; however, it had a minor effect on the electrode performance. The formation of a composite electrode led to an obvious improvement in both charge transfer and surface-related processes. With the increase of ScSZ content, the rate-limiting step of oxygen reduction reaction steadily changed from mainly a surface diffusion process to an electron transfer process. The optimal ScSZ content and sintering temperature of the electrode layer were found to be 20 wt.% and 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C, respectively. Under optimal conditions, an anode-supported single cell with LSSM + ScSZ composite cathode showed high power densities of \u223c1211 and 386 mW cm \u22122 at 800 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. Keywords Intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Composite cathodes Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Oxygen reduction 1 Introduction The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an all-solid electrochemical device which converts chemical energy to electrical power at elevated temperature with very high efficiency and low emissions. A single SOFC is composed of a porous anode and a porous cathode, separated by a dense electrolyte. The single cells are stacked in series or/and parallel to meet the potential and power requirements for practical application. A typical SOFC is composed of an yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and lanthanum strontium manganese (LSM) cathode operated at around 1000 \u00b0C. Nowadays, it has been well recognized that multiple benefits can be derived by reducing the operating temperature of a SOFC to the intermediate temperature range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C, including reduced fabrication cost, prolonged life time, versatile cell materials, and elegant sealing [1\u20137] . Cathode is the location at which oxygen reduction reaction takes place. Since oxygen activation is normally much more difficult than that of hydrogen, with the drop of operating temperature, the polarization resistance for a SOFC with thin-film electrolyte originates primarily from the cathode [8\u201310] . The development of a cathode with high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction is thereby critical for the production of intermediate-temperature (IT)-SOFCs. It is well known that cathode performance is determined by many factors, such as electrical conductivity, the thermal expansion coefficient, phase reactions between the electrolyte and electrode, and oxygen surface exchange and bulk diffusion properties of the cathode material [2,8] . A synergetic effect between electrolyte and electrode may also be observed. For example, a mixed conducting perovskite-type Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide that performs well on a doped ceria electrolyte did not perform as well on stabilized zirconia electrolytes [5,11\u201313] . Thus, the electrode material and microstructure should be specially tailored for the individual electrolyte. Stabilized zirconia is still the most commonly used electrolyte in SOFC due to its excellent mechanical properties, favorable redox stability, and negligible electronic conductivity. Scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) shows the highest ionic conductivity among the lanthanide-stabilized zirconias and has received considerable attention recently [14\u201317] . Today, the typical cathode material matching the ScSZ electrolyte is still the LSM oxide, although it shows poor activity for oxygen reduction at reduced temperatures. Many strategies have been exploited to improve its cathodic performance at reduced temperature, such as optimizing the microstructure of the cathode and electrolyte interface [18\u201320] , surface modification of the LSM with precious metals such as Ag or Pt [21\u201324] or samaria or gadolinia doped ceria [25,26] , or polarizing under direct cathodic current for a limited period of time to create oxygen vacancies on the surface or inside the bulk of the LSM [27\u201329] . The simplest and most widely applied technique still involves introducing an ionic conducting phase such as YSZ and ScSZ into the LSM to form a composite electrode [30\u201339] . It is believed that the improvement in cathode performance by the formation of composite electrode is due to the extension of active sites from the typical electrolyte\u2013electrode\u2013air triple-phase boundary (TPB) into the electrode bulk. Furthermore, the thermal expansion compatibility and adhesion of the electrode to electrolyte is also improved. Recently, we demonstrated that doping a proper amount of Sc 3+ into the B-site of LSM perovskite with the formation of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc y Mn 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( y = 0.0\u20130.2) solid solution resulted in an improved cathode performance for the facilitation of the creation of oxygen vacancies inside the oxide bulk under current polarization [40] . In this study, to further improve the cathode performance of the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSSM) oxide at intermediate temperatures, composite electrodes were synthesized and evaluated as cathodes on a ScSZ electrolyte, adopting ScSZ as a second phase. The optimal LSSM to ScSZ ratio and the fabrication parameters were determined. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis and characterization Both LSSM and ScSZ oxide powders were synthesized via an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [41] with La(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 x H 2 O, Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O, Zr(NO 3 ) 4 \u00b75H 2 O and Sc 2 O 3 (all in A.R. grade) as the raw materials for the cation sources. Sc 2 O 3 powder was prepared in an aqueous solution by dissolving it in diluted nitric acid with heating and magnetic stirring before applying the sol\u2013gel synthesis. The preparation of LSSM, for example, is described as follows. The required amounts of metal nitrates and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 \u00b74H 2 O, according to the nominal molecular composition of the target product, were prepared in an aqueous solution. EDTA and citric acid, both acted as complexing agents, were added to the solution in sequence. The pH of the solution was adjusted to \u223c6 via the addition of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O. After evaporating the water from the mixture via heating, a transparent gel was obtained. It was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C forming a solid precursor, which was subsequently calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere to yield the desired product. The phase structures of the oxide materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractormeter. Diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning angles (2 \u03b8 ) between 20\u00b0 and 80\u00b0. 2.2 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical characterization of the composite electrodes with ScSZ content varying from 0 to 50 wt.% was conducted using a three-electrode electrochemical cell [40] . Electrolyte disks were prepared from (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) powder by die pressing and were sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. The thickness and diameter of a sintered disk were 0.3 and 16 mm, respectively. Isopropyl alcohol-based slurry containing LSSM and the proper amount of ScSZ was sprayed on one side of the electrolyte substrate and then calcinated at 1000\u20131200 \u00b0C in air for 2 h to form the working electrode. Ethanol-based silver slurry was applied to the other side of the electrolyte as symmetrically as possible with the working electrode acting as the counter electrode. Silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai, China) was used as the reference electrode and was painted in a ring surrounding the counter electrode. The gap between the counter electrode and reference electrode was \u223c4 mm, and the area of the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode was 0.26, 0.26 and 0.3 cm 2 , respectively. The cathodic polarization resistance was measured using a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvonostat. The frequency range of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was from 0.1 Hz to 1000 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV. Data were collected using Zplot 2.9c software. The polarization current was varied from 0 to 1000 mA cm \u22122 in 10 mA intervals. The results were applied to correct for the IR drop corresponding to the electrolyte and lead resistances, thereby establishing resistance-free I / E characteristics. Series resistance data obtained from EIS measurements were used to make this correction. The overall impedance data were fit by a complex non-linear least square (CNLS) fitting program by Z-View 2.9c software. 2.3 Single-cell test Anode-supported cells were adopted for a performance evaluation of the composite electrodes under actual fuel cell conditions. The anode was made from NiO and ScSZ mixture with a weight ratio of 60 to 40. An electrolyte membrane was fabricated onto NiO + ScSZ substrate using a dual-dry pressing followed by co-firing at 1500 \u00b0C in air for 5 h. A slurry, prepared by dispersing composite cathode powder into an isopropyl alcohol liquid medium, was sprayed on the electrolyte surface, which was subsequently calcinated at 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. Silver paste was adopted as a current collector. Fuel cell performance was assessed via I \u2013 V characterization at temperatures between 650 and 800 \u00b0C. Measurements were performed using a digital sourcemeter (Keithely 2420) which was interfaced with a computer to facilitate data acquisition. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Reactivity between LSSM and ScSZ When LSSM and ScSZ composite oxides are applied as the electrodes for a ScSZ-electrolyte SOFC, the phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ may happen both inside the composite electrodes and also at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces. Such a reaction is likely at high operating temperature or during the firing of the electrode layer onto the electrolyte surface. It has been demonstrated that the phase reaction between a LSM electrode and YSZ electrolyte has happened at high temperatures and led to the formation of a La 2 Zr 2 O 7 insulating phase, which could block the ionic diffusion and led to a substantial increase of interfacial polarization resistance [42] . To systematically investigate the phase reaction, LSSM and ScSZ powders in a 50:50 weight ratio were well mixed by grinding with an agate mortar and pestle. The resultant mixed powders were then calcinated at various temperatures under an air atmosphere for 2 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the powders underwent a phase composition analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 , all the diffraction patterns of the powders can be indexed based on the physical mixture of LSSM and ScSZ oxides when the calcination temperature was 1000, 1050 or 1100 \u00b0C. This suggests that the solid-phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ was negligible under such circumstances. With the further increase of calcination temperature to 1150 \u00b0C, the characteristic diffraction peak of a pyrochlore-type La 2 Zr 2 O 7 at 2 \u03b8 = 28.3\u00b0 started to appear, although weak in intensity, and the peak intensity was strengthened with the further increase of firing temperature. The reaction can be described by the following equation: (1) La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3 + (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 \u2192 La 0.8\u2212 x Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3\u22123 x /2 + ( x /2)La 2 Zr 2 O 7 + (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9\u2212 x Since La 2 Zr 2 O 7 is an insulating phase, the phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ may have an impact on the electrode performance, which will be discussed in detail later. 3.2 Effect of ScSZ to LSSM ratio on the electrode performance A composite electrode has been widely applied to improve the performance of LSM-based material for oxygen reduction at intermediate temperatures. It was reported that the best activity for oxygen reduction of a LSM + YSZ composite electrode was achieved at a YSZ content of 20\u201340 wt.% [32,36,38] . The effect of ScSZ on the performance of a LSSM + ScSZ composite electrode for oxygen reduction, and the optimal ScSZ weight content was investigated by EIS and step current polarization (SCP) based on a three-electrode configuration. To avoid the impact of phase reaction on the electrode performance, a sintering temperature of 1100 \u00b0C was adopted for this study. The EIS of LSSM + ScSZ composite electrodes with various ScSZ contents at an operating temperature of 800 \u00b0C, measured under an air atmosphere and zero direct current passage are shown in Fig. 2 . For the pure LSSM electrode, the area specific polarization resistance (ASR) reached 2.1 \u03a9 cm 2 , which is only slightly improved as compared to the typical value for a LSM electrode [8\u201310,30,32,38] . We have demonstrated previously that partial substitution of Mn 4+ in LSM by Sc 3+ did not introduce ionic conductivity into the oxide under zero direct current passage, i.e., the oxygen reduction over the LSSM electrode was still strictly limited to the TPB region. However, introducing ScSZ as a second phase with a content as low as 10 wt.% substantially reduced the ASR to a value of \u223c0.75 \u03a9 cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C. With the further increase of ScSZ content, the ASR decreased steadily. It reached \u223c0.39 \u03a9 cm 2 at a ScSZ content of 50 wt.%. It is clear that the introduction of the ScSZ phase effectively increased the electrode activity for oxygen reduction. The overall electrochemical reaction for oxygen reduction over the cathode of an SOFC can be described as follows: (2) O 2 (g) + 4e \u2212 = 2O 2\u2212 In reality, it may involve many sub-steps, such as oxygen gas diffusion, oxygen surface adsorption, oxygen dissociation, electron transfer, oxygen-ion transfer, etc. To determine the role of the ScSZ phase in the composite electrode on oxygen reduction, the EIS data were fit to an equivalent circuit composed of two R/CPE units in series with an electrolytic resistor ( R 0 ) and an inductor ( L 0 ). A constant phase element (CPE) represents a non-ideal capacitor of the double layer at a non-planar TPB. The high-frequency arc is typically associated with the transport/transfer of oxygen intermediates/oxide ions between electrode and electrolyte and through the composite electrode. The intermediate-frequency arc is related with the surface diffusion process, which may include the oxygen surface adsorption, oxygen dissociation, oxygen (oxygen-ion) surface diffusion, and electron transfer [8,30\u201332,43\u201345] . A typical fitting result is shown in Fig. 3 a with the equivalent circuit presented as an insert. The effect of the ScSZ content in the composite electrode on the size of the high-frequency arc and intermediate-frequency arc are presented in Fig. 3 b. The size of both arcs decreased significantly and monotonically with the increase of ScSZ content, implying both processes were improved after the introduction of the ScSZ phase. The improvement in the oxygen-ion charge transfer process (high-frequency arc) with the increase of ScSZ content can be explained by the increased nominal ionic conductivity, while the increase in surface diffusion activity was attributed to the improved oxygen surface diffusion and oxygen dissociation processes. Both are facilitated by the increase of surface oxygen vacancy. Since oxygen surface reaction (dissociation and incorporation) on stabilized zirconia is known to be slow, only the diffusion process is likely to be significant; therefore the sizes of intermediate-frequency arcs decreased more significantly than high-frequency ones, as shown in Fig. 3 b. It is well known that LSM can be partially reduced under a cathodic polarization, which leads to a substantial increase of its activity for oxygen reduction due to the formation of a large number of re-generated oxygen vacancies [27\u201329,39,46] . Thus, we here investigated the behavior of LSSM + ScSZ composite electrodes under a cathodic polarization. Fig. 4 shows the impedance spectroscopes of the corresponding LSSM + ScSZ electrodes in Fig. 2 after a cathodic polarization at \u22120.5 V for 40 min. An additional depressed semicircle appeared at the low-frequency range (several Hz). A similar appearance of a low-frequency arc was also observed in the literature for a typical LSM electrode after its polarization [30,38] , where this was attributed to the non-charge-related gas phase oxygen diffusion process. Since gas phase diffusion is not an intrinsic property of an electrode, only the semicircle at the high to intermediate-frequency range was considered for further analysis. Overall, the increase in ScSZ content first resulted in a decrease in overall polarization resistance. It reached a minimum value of \u223c0.22 \u03a9 cm 2 at a ScSZ content of 20 wt.% at 800 \u00b0C (the gas phase diffusion polarization resistance was not included), and then increased with the further increase of ScSZ content. Such a trend is different from that before the polarization, which showed a steady decrease in polarization resistance with the increase of ScSZ content. If we compare the corresponding ASRs for the composite electrodes before and after the polarization, it was found that all the samples showed an improvement in polarization resistance for oxygen reduction after the cathodic polarization, however, the higher the ScSZ content the less the improvement in overall polarization resistance was observed. Under polarization, the Mn 4+ in LSSM lattice was partially reduced and led to the formation of oxygen vacancy both over the surface and inside the oxide bulk, which then effectively improved the surface exchange kinetics due to the increased number of active sites for oxygen reduction. The EIS in Fig. 4 was also fit to an equivalent circuit by modifying the existing one as shown in Fig. 3 a by adding a new R/CPE (R 3 /CPE 3 ) unit in series to simulate the gas phase diffusion process of the low-frequency arc. Fig. 5 a shows a typical result with the equivalent circuit presented as an insert. The derived high-frequency arc was associated with the ion transport process, while the intermediate-frequency arc was related to the surface diffusion, oxygen dissociation, and electron transport processes. As compared to that before polarization ( Fig. 3 b), the ASR of the ion transport process after the polarization was reduced for all the samples with various ScSZ contents ( Fig. 5 b), agreed well with the increased nominal ionic conductivity contributed from the LSSM phase because of the partial reduction. Similar to that before polarization, the polarization resistance of the ion transport process decreased monotonically with the increase of ScSZ content. As to the intermediate-frequency arc, the size first decreased with ScSZ content, reached a minimum value at a ScSZ content of 20 wt.%, then remained almost constant with an increase of ScSZ content to 30 wt.%, and then increased sharply with the further increase of ScSZ content to 40 wt.% and higher ( Fig. 5 b). Such a phenomenon can be explained as follows. Under polarization, the LSSM is partially reduced, increasing the surface oxygen vacancy concentration on the one hand, which is beneficial for improving the oxygen dissociation and oxygen surface diffusion; on the other hand, the creation of oxygen vacancy results in a decrease in electrical conductivity, detrimental to the electron charge transfer process. The increase of the polarization resistance for the surface diffusion process at a ScSZ content of >20 wt.% suggests the electronic charge transfer became predominant in the rate determination in the surface diffusion processes. To further demonstrate the effect of ScSZ on the oxygen reduction process in the composite electrode, the dependence of 1/ R versus the inverse oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere 1 / P O 2 was conducted, where the polarization resistance R was a sum of R E1 and R E2 in Fig. 5 a. The slope ( n ) has significant information on the oxygen reduction process [32,43\u201345] . Fig. 6 shows the dependence of n on ScSZ content in the LSSM + ScSZ composite electrode at 800 \u00b0C within the oxygen partial pressure range from 0.002\u20131.0 atm. It decreased steadily with the increase of ScSZ content, from an initial value of \u223c0.56 at 0 wt.% ScSZ (pure LSSM) to a value of \u223c0.30 with 50 wt.% ScSZ. Typically, a value of 0.5 for n is an indication of the rate-limiting by oxygen surface diffusion or oxygen dissociation while 1/4 should be observed for an electron charge transfer process. It then suggests that the rate-limiting step for the oxygen reduction process changes steadily from mainly a surface diffusion process to an electron transfer process ( n = 0.25). Table 1 shows the activation energy ( E a ) of the impedance polarization with respect to the temperature at various ScSZ contents before and after the polarization. All the E a are between 110 and 150 kJ mol \u22121 , similar to the literature results for a LSM cathode [8\u201310,30,32,38] . The lowest E a was also achieved at a ScSZ content of 20 wt.%. The performance of LSSM + ScSZ composite electrodes was further investigated by the step current polarization experiment. Fig. 7 shows the overpotential\u2013current curves of LSSM + ScSZ electrodes with various ScSZ contents at 800 \u00b0C. At low current density, for example \u22120.1 A cm \u22121 , the overpotential has the sequence of LSSM > LSSM\u201310% ScSZ > LSSM\u201340% ScSZ \u223c LSSM\u201350% ScSZ > LSSM\u201330% ScSZ \u223c LSSM\u201320% ScSZ. At a higher current density of \u22121 A cm \u22121 , the sequence changed to LSSM > LSSM\u201310% ScSZ > LSSM\u201350% ScSZ > LSSM\u201340% ScSZ > LSSM\u201330% ScSZ > LSSM\u201320% ScSZ. This further supports the idea that the optimal ScSZ content for a LSSM + ScSZ composite electrode is around 20 wt.%. 3.3 Effect of sintering temperature on the electrode performance For practical application, the electrode should be fabricated onto the electrolyte surface. To determine the best sintering temperature for the electrode layer, the LSSM + ScSZ composite electrode with the ScSZ content of 20 wt.% was fabricated onto the ScSZ electrolyte surface at various firing temperatures. Fig. 8 a and b shows the ASRs of the corresponding electrodes before and after polarization at \u22120.5 V at 800 \u00b0C for 40 min, respectively. The increase of sintering temperature first resulted in a decrease in polarization resistance up to 1100 \u00b0C, both before and after the polarization. A slight increase of the ASR was observed when the temperature increased to 1150 \u00b0C. The further increase in sintering temperature, however, resulted in a sharp increase in the polarization resistance. Therefore, the optimal sintering temperature for the electrode layer should be between 1000 and 1150 \u00b0C. As demonstrated previously, sintering is required for adhesion of electrode and electrolyte, but high-temperature calcination could result in a phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ both inside the electrode and between the electrode and electrolyte layer with the formation of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 . Since La 2 Zr 2 O 7 is an insulating phase with negligible ionic and electronic conductivity, it will block the oxygen-ion transfer through the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, resulting in an increase of interfacial polarization resistance when located between the LSSM and electrolyte interface. On the other hand, a certain degree of solid-phase reaction between the electrode and electrolyte layers is helpful for reducing the contact resistance by increasing the connection between the electrode particles and between the electrode and the electrolyte layer. Furthermore, a slight A-site deficiency in perovskite created via reaction (1) at high calcination temperature is also beneficial for oxygen reduction since it may introduce oxygen vacancies into the oxide bulk [46\u201348] . Fig. 9 a and b is ASRs of the high frequency and intermediate arcs before and after the cathodic polarization. A steady increase in the size of high-frequency arc supported the fact that the solid-phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ became more serious with the increase of firing temperature. The size of the high-frequency arc was, however, still much smaller than the intermediate-frequency arc, suggesting the polarization resistance of the oxygen ionic charge transfer was relatively small as compared to that of surface diffusion/electron charge transfer processes. This implies that the solid-phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ at high temperature did not have significant effect on the oxygen reduction over a LSSM + ScSZ composite electrode. The polarization resistance for the intermediate-frequency arc first envisaged a decrease with sintering temperature, reached a minimum at a sintering temperature between 1100 and 1150 \u00b0C, and then increased obviously with the further increase of temperature. Such a phenomenon could be explained as follows. The increase in firing temperature resulted in a better contact between LSSM and ScSZ, which was beneficial for reducing the interfacial diffusion resistance. On the other hand, it also resulted in a decrease of the absolute electrode surface area, which was detrimental to the oxygen surface reduction. Calcination at 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C resulted in a sound connection between LSSM and ScSZ in the electrode and also a favorable electrode surface area. Table 2 contains the activation energies calculated based on the temperature dependence of the polarization resistance before and after the polarization. The measured values were also within the range of 110\u2013150 kJ mol \u22121 , similar to the literature results for typical LSM + YSZ electrodes. The electrode fired at 1100 \u00b0C showed the lowest activation energy both before and after the polarization, followed by the 1150 \u00b0C fired one. This further implies that the best sintering temperature for the cathode layer is 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C. The optimal sintering temperature was further determined by the step current polarization of an 80 wt.% LSSM + 20 wt.% ScSZ composite electrode. Fig. 10 shows the overpotential\u2013current curves of the LSSM + ScSZ electrodes fired at various temperatures for 2 h. The electrode fired at 1100 \u00b0C showed the lowest overpotential, followed by the one fired at 1150, 1050, 1200 and 1000 \u00b0C. 3.4 Single-cell performance To demonstrate the performance of LSSM + ScSZ composite electrodes in complete cells under real fuel cell conditions, ScSZ + Ni supported thin-film (\u223c25 \u03bcm) ScSZ electrolyte fuel cells with LSSM + ScSZ cathodes were fabricated. The cathode layers were put onto the electrolyte surfaces at the optimal firing temperature of 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C. The ScSZ content of 0\u201340 wt.% in the composite electrodes was investigated. Fig. 11 shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the cells sintered at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 h in air by applying 3% water humidified hydrogen as the fuel and ambient air as the cathode atmosphere. It shows that the fuel cell with 80 wt.% LSSM + 20 wt.% ScSZ composite electrodes displayed the best cell performance, in accordance with the results from the three-electrode EIS and step current polarization experiments. For a pure LSSM electrode, a peak power density of 526 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 800 \u00b0C, while it increased to \u223c1200 mW cm \u22122 when an 80 wt.% LSSM + 20 wt.% ScSZ composite was adopted as the cathode, with greater than 100% improvement. Fig. 12 shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of a cell with 80 wt.% LSSM + 20 wt.% ScSZ cathode at various temperatures. A peak power density as high as 386 mW cm \u22122 was still achieved at 650 \u00b0C. All the above results support the idea of an 80 wt.% LSSM + 20 wt.% ScSZ composite as a potential cathode for SOFC on ScSZ electrolyte operating at intermediate temperatures. 4 Conclusions The ionic conductor ScSZ was introduced as a second phase to LSSM perovskite forming a composite electrode for ScSZ-electrolyte solid-oxide fuel cell, which effectively improved the cathodic performance at intermediate temperature. The optimal ScSZ amount is around 20 wt.%; it shows a polarization resistance of \u223c0.57 \u03a9 cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C as compared to a value of \u223c2.1 \u03a9 cm 2 for a pure LSSM electrode before polarization. The rate-determining step of the oxygen reduction reaction on the composite cathode changed steadily from mainly a surface diffusion process to an electron transfer process with the increase of ScSZ content. A solid-phase reaction between LSSM and ScSZ occurred at 1150 \u00b0C or higher, with the formation of a La 2 Zr 2 O 7 insulating phase; however, it did not have a significant impact on the electrode performance. The optimal sintering temperature of the composite cathode with 20 wt.% ScSZ was found to be 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C. Under such sintering temperatures, a favorable connection between LSSM and ScSZ in the electrode was achieved and a high electrode surface area could also be sustained. An anode-supported single cell with a LSSM-20 wt.% ScSZ composite cathode shows promising power densities of \u223c1211 and 386 mW cm \u22122 at 800 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. Together these results suggest that the LSSM + ScSZ composite electrode is very promising for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell application.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the SScC cathode was studied by two-electrode impedance, three-electrode-polarization test, and four-probe dc conductivity measurement at various temperatures, oxygen partial pressures, and polarization values. The oxygen nonstoichiometry of SScC is 0.552 at 500\u00b0C. An extremely high oxygen vacancy concentration in the SScC lattice decreased the resistances from oxygen adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion processes at low temperatures. This subsequently improved the electrochemical performance of the cathode. The polarization overpotential is only -110 mV for the SScC cathode at the current density of -1070 mA cm-2 at 600\u00b0C in air. The kinetics of ORR on the SScC cathode was studied by ac impedance, which revealed that the charge-transfer process was the rate-determining step due to the extremely low electrical conductivity of SScC. \u00a9 2009 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "title": "A new carbon fuel cell with high power output by integrating with in situ catalytic reverse Boudouard reaction",
        "abstract": "Solid carbon was investigated as the fuel for an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC). An innovative, indirect operating method involving internal catalytic gasification of carbon to gaseous carbon monoxide via the reverse Boudouard reaction (C(s) + CO 2 (g) \u2192 2CO(g)) was proposed. The carbon gasification reaction rate was greatly enhanced by adopting Fe m O n \u2013M x O (M = Li, K, Ca) as a catalyst. A peak power density of \u223c297 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 850 \u00b0C for an anode-supported SOFC with scandium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode by applying a catalyst-loaded, activated carbon as fuel. This peak power density was only modestly lower than that obtained using gaseous hydrogen as the fuel. Keywords Solid oxide fuel cell Carbon Electrochemical performance Gasification 1 Introduction Today, the world is over-reliant on oil and natural gas. Solid fuels, including carbon, provide promising alternative choices because of their wide availability and ultra-high volumetric energy density [1] . In addition, developing new processes with improved energy conversion efficiency with the aim of reducing CO 2 emissions is important to alleviate global warming. Consequently, carbon fuel cells have been receiving increasing attention recently [2\u20139] . Electrooxidation of fuel typically occurs over the triple phase boundary (TPB). When carbon is applied as the fuel in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), even if created via the in situ carbon deposition method, it usually contacts the outermost part of the anode, far from the electroactive zone [3] . Because of this difficulty, most research to date has focused on high-temperature liquid electrolytes, employing hydroxide [5] or carbonate electrolytes [4,6] . The most serious problems associated with such cells are corrosion of materials and degradation of the electrolyte. An alternative technique uses a solid electrolyte with a fuel electrode/electrolyte based on a slurry of liquid electrolyte and solid electrode [7,8] . The molten carbonate electrolyte effectively extends the anode/electrolyte region and removes solid/solid contact problems. However, it requires a conductive carbon for efficient current collecting, and the corrosion problems of liquid electrolytes are not eliminated. Herein, we report significantly improved power output from a carbon-fueled SOFC by integrating it with an in situ, catalytic, reverse \u201cBoudouard reaction\u201d. Using an Fe m O n \u2013alkaline metal oxide catalyst, the solid carbon was internally gasified by reacting it with CO 2 . A peak power density as high as 297 mW cm \u22122 could be achieved via this process, which is only modestly lower than that achieved with gaseous hydrogen as the fuel, making this system highly promising for practical applications. 2 Experimental The fuel cell adopted in this study was a NiO (60 wt%) + ScSZ (40 wt%) anode-supported thin-film (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 \u2013(ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) electrolyte cell with a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathode. The active area of the cell was 0.48 cm 2 (cathode). Fe m O n \u2013M x O, was adopted as the catalyst for the reverse Boudouard reaction, where M x O was a mixture of Li 2 O, K 2 O and CaO. The catalyst-loaded carbon was prepared via the impregnation/calcination method. For a typical synthesis, 24.24 g Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O, 1.379 g LiNO 3 , 2.022 g KNO 3 , and 4.723 g Ca(NO 3 ) 2 were dissolved into 100 ml de-ionized water. Then, 50 g activated carbon or graphite was added to the solution under vigorous stirring for 24 h. The colloid was dried at 110 \u00b0C for 12 h and then calcined at 700 \u00b0C in nitrogen for 2 h. The schematic design for the reverse Boudouard reaction test experiment is shown in Fig. 1 a. The catalytic, reverse Boudouard reaction was tested in a flow-through quartz-tube reactor. Approximately 0.2 g catalyst-modified or pure carbon was dropped into a quartz-tube reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. CO 2 was introduced into the reactor from the top of the reactor at a flow rate ( \u03bd CO 2 ) of 30 ml/min (standard temperature and pressure, STP). The effluent gas from the reactor was introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatography, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Poraplot Q column for the separation of CO and CO 2 . The test was performed from 700 to 900 \u00b0C at 50 \u00b0C intervals. The CO formation rate ( R CO ) was calculated using the following equation: (1) R CO = \u03bd CO 2 m carbon V m 2 [ CO ] [ CO ] + 2 [ CO 2 ] The fuel cell performance was tested in a reactor with the configuration schematically shown in Fig. 1 b. For the fuel cell test, the cell was sealed onto a quartz tube by means of silver paste, and the carbon fuel was put into intimate contact with the anode surface using an asbestos and quartz sand support. Another quartz tube was positioned beneath the carbon layer to allow introducing of CO 2 or release of the reaction product from the fuel cell (CO + CO 2 ). Ambient air was used as the cathode atmosphere. Current\u2013voltage ( I\u2013V) values were collected based on the four-terminal configuration. The cell performance was also investigated with alternating current (AC) methods under the open circuit voltage using a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer connected to a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. 3 Results and discussion Since it is much easier for gaseous CO to reach the TPB region due to its high diffusivity, carbon gasification to CO may result in improved cell performance when using solid carbon fuel. It is well known that carbon can be gasified via the reverse Boudouard reaction of C(s) + CO 2 (g) \u2192 2CO(g) at high temperatures. Thinking of CO 2 as the complete electrochemical oxidation product of carbon, the internal gasification of carbon by CO 2 is highly attractive. Indeed, several researchers have observed the significant effect of the Boudouard reaction in the operation of direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs) at high temperatures [9\u201311] . However, in some other investigations, a different mechanism of direct electrochemical oxidation of carbon to CO 2 has been proposed [7] . The reverse Boudouard reaction was experimentally examined. As presented in Table 1 , the CO formation rate was highly dependent on the type and surface area of the solid carbon. Only the activated carbon with an ultra-high surface area (1214.2 m 2 g \u22121 , carbon 1) delivered a favorable CO formation rate. However, the reaction rate dropped sharply with reduced carbon surface area and reduced operating temperatures. For the activated carbon with a lower surface area (227.4 m 2 g \u22121 , carbon 2) the CO formation rate dropped to only 0.317 mmol (min g) \u22121 , even at 900 \u00b0C. The above results help explain the conflicting observations made by different researchers about the carbon electrochemical oxidation mechanism in the DCFC [7,10] . To carry out carbon gasification at intermediate temperatures with sufficiently high rates, a catalyst was necessary. Alkali metal salts and iron catalysts are known to be highly active catalysts for coal gasification [12\u201314] . After the introduction of Fe m O n \u2013M x O (M = Li, K, Ca) as a catalyst, the CO formation rate increased noticeably. Such improvements were even more apparent for the forms of carbon with lower surface areas. The CO formation rate was only 0.317 mmol (min g) \u22121 for carbon 2 (227.4 m 2 g \u22121 ) at 900 \u00b0C without a catalyst, while it increased to 14.0 mmol (min g) \u22121 with the catalyst. Even with the highly stable graphite (4.2 m 2 g \u22121 , carbon 1), a catalytic CO formation rate of 1.55 mmol (min g) \u22121 was achieved at 900 \u00b0C, as compared to only 0.082 mmol (min g) \u22121 when there was no catalyst. Such apparent increases in the carbon conversion rate can be explained by the following mechanisms [12\u201314] : Fe m O n + CO 2 \u2192 Fe m O n +1 + CO Fe m O n +1 + C \u2192 Fe m O n + CO (Li 2 , Ca)CO 3 + C \u2192 (Li 2 , Ca)O + 2CO (Li 2 , Ca)O + CO 2 \u2192 (Li 2 , Ca)CO 3 The potential indirect operation of carbon-fueled SOFC through internally catalytic CO 2 gasification of carbon was first investigated by introducing CO 2 externally. Approximately 1.0 g of catalyst-loaded, activated carbon was applied as the fuel while the CO 2 flow rate was set at 30 ml/min. As listed in Table 2 , peak power densities of 98.3 and 297 mW cm \u22122 were achieved at 775 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively, with an external CO 2 feeding. As a comparison, a similar cell with hydrogen fuel was also measured. Peak power densities of 189 and 472 mW cm \u22122 were achieved at 775 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. These results are in good agreement with our previous reports for an anode-supported thin-film ScSZ electrolyte fuel cell with a LSM cathode [15] . The results suggest that cell performance is only modestly reduced when operating with carbon generated via the in situ carbon gasification process compared to operating with pure hydrogen. Since CO 2 is the complete electrochemical oxidation product of carbon and CO, the most attractive carbon gasification process is reforming with in situ-created CO 2 over the anode. As shown in Table 2 , peak power densities of 157 and 286 mW cm \u22122 were achieved without external CO 2 feeding at 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively, which were only slightly lower than that those achieved when an external CO 2 flow was introduced as the reactant. The corresponding impedance spectroscopy at various temperatures for the cell with and without the external CO 2 feeding are shown in Fig. 2 . As expected, both operation modes resulted in similar cell impedance at corresponding temperatures. Carbon deposition over the nickel anode is a serious problem when operating with carbon-containing fuel. When CO is used as the fuel, carbon deposition can be predicted using the Boudouard reaction: 2CO(g) \u2192 C(s) + CO 2 (g). Fig. 3 shows the SEM photos of the fuel cells after operation with carbon fuels without CO 2 feeding, with pure CO as the fuel, and with hydrogen as the fuel. No apparent carbon formation was observed over the anode for the cell operating on carbon fuel without CO 2 feeding while observable carbon was detected over the anode after operating on pure CO fuel under open circuit conditions for 2 h. In the current study, by applying solid carbon as the fuel via the internal gasification process without external CO 2 feeding, CO 2 was formed and diffused from the anode. This particular operation mode ensured a high CO 2 concentration around the anode surface, demonstrated by a lower open circuit voltage (OCV) for the cell with in situ-created CO 2 as the reactant gas, as compared to the cell with externally introduced CO 2 , as shown in Table 2 . This effectively suppressed the carbon formation. It is well known that carbon formation is more likely to occur under OCV conditions when using CO or a hydrocarbon as the fuel, as supported by our observations, which are shown in Fig. 3 c. By applying carbon as the fuel via internal reforming without CO 2 feeding, the formation of CO was stopped under OCV conditions because no CO 2 was produced over the anode. Since carbon has a negligible vapor pressure at intermediate temperatures, carbon deposition over the anode surface was also greatly suppressed. This may be an additional benefit to operating with carbon fuel via internal gasification without CO 2 feeding. 4 Conclusions By adopting Fe m O n \u2013M x O (M = Li, K, Ca) as a catalyst, the carbon gasification rate was significantly improved at intermediate temperatures. This then makes the indirect conversion of solid carbon in an IT-SOFC via internal gasification viable. Because of the much higher diffusivity of gaseous CO as compared to solid carbon, a very promising power output with a peak power density around 300 mW cm \u22122 was successfully obtained, even without external CO 2 feeding. This is only modestly lower than that obtained when using pure hydrogen as the fuel. The optimization of the fuel cell cathode for oxygen reduction and the anode for CO oxidation may result in further increases in cell performance. The catalytic, reverse Boudouard reaction is highly promising as an effective way to operate with carbon-fuel in a SOFC.

        "abstract": "Spinel-type Al3+-doped Li4Ti5O12 oxide with the nominal composition of Li4Ti4.85Al0.15O12 was synthesized by a cellulose-assisted glycine-nitrate combustion process at reduced temperatures. X-ray diffraction characterization demonstrated that all Al3+ was successfully incorporated into the spinel lattice structure after calcination at 700\u00b0C. The Al3+ doping did not have obvious effect on the phase formation and phase structure while it led to an increase in surface area and a decrease in crystallite size of the oxide. The discharge capacity, the rate performance and the cycling stability were all slightly improved after the Al3+ doping. First discharge capacity ~221 mAh g-1 was achieved for the as-synthesized Li4Ti4.85Al0.15O12 from calcination at 700\u00b0C, higher than 189 mAh g-1 for the pristine Li4Ti5O12 prepared by the same way. Al3+ was likely incorporated into both Li+ tetrahedral site and Ti4+ octahedral site with the majority into the Ti4+ site. Al3+ doping into the Li+ tetrahedral site increased the reducibility of Ti4+; consequently comparable electronic conductivity was observed for Li4Ti5O12 and Li4Ti4.85Al0.15O12 after the reduction. However, it also induced a decrease of lithium-ion diffusion coefficient and a transition of rate-limiting step of the electrode reaction from electron charge transfer for Li4Ti5O12 to Li+ diffusion for Li4Ti4.85Al0.15O12. The improved performance from the Al3+ doping was mainly attributed to the increased surface area of the oxide. \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Three modification methods are pursued, including the physical mixing of BZCY4 with a ZnO solid (method 1), introducing zinc during the solution stage of the sol-gel synthesis (method 2) and doping zinc into a perovskite lattice by synthesis of a new compound with a nominal composition of BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y 0.16Zn0.04O3-\u03b4 (method 3). Method 1 turned out to be the most effective at reducing the sintering temperature, which can mainly be attributed to a reactive sintering although ZnO doping into the BZCY4 lattice also facilitates the sintering.

        "abstract": "As a lithium-intercalation material, high crystallinity is important for Li4Ti5O12 to achieve good capacity and cycling stability, while a large surface area and a short lithium diffusion distance are critical to increase rate capacity. In this study, well-crystallized Li 4Ti5O12 nanoplates with outstanding electrochemical performance were facially prepared through a two-step hydrothermal preparation with benzyl alcohol-NH3\u00b7H 2O (BN) as the solvent and a subsequent intermediate-temperature calcination at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. To support the superiority of benzyl alcohol-NH3\u00b7H2O (BN) for hydrothermal synthesis, ethanol-NH3\u00b7H2O (EN) was also comparatively studied as solvent. In addition, different hydrothermal reaction times were tried to locate the optimal reaction time. The nature of as-prepared Li 4Ti5O12-BN (LTO-BN) and Li4Ti 5O12-EN (LTO-EN) was characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption/desorption tests, SEM, TEM and TGA-DSC. Compared with EN, the BN hydrothermal solvent facilitated the formation of nanosheet-Li 4Ti5O12 with wall thicknesses of 8-15 nm and better crystallization. After a 6 h hydrothermal reaction at 180 \u00b0C and subsequent calcination, well-crystallized Li4Ti5O 12-BN nanoplates were produced, which demonstrate a superior discharge capacity of 160 mA h g-1, even at 40 C, maintaining a capacity of 88.8% compared with that at 1 C. The nanoplates also exhibited excellent cycling stability, retaining a discharge capacity of 153 mA h g -1 after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 C. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "A perovskite-type Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCN) oxide is investigated as the cathode material of oxygen-ionic solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SDC) electrolyte. Powder X-ray diffraction and SEM characterization demonstrate that solid phase reactions between BSCN and SDC are negligible at temperatures up to 1100 \u00b0C. The results of thermal-expansion and electrical conductivity measurements indicate the introduction of Ba 2+ into the A-site of SrCo 0.9 N 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SCN) led to a decrease in the thermal-expansion coefficient (TEC) and electrical conductivity of the compound. A TEC of 14.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 is observed for BSCN within a temperature range of 200\u2013500 \u00b0C. The chemical diffusion coefficient ( D chem ) and surface exchange constant ( k ex ) of BSCN and SCN are obtained using an electrical conductivity relaxation technique and BSCN prove to have higher D chem and k ex than SCN. An area-specific resistance of 0.1 \u03a9 cm \u22122 is achieved for BSCN cathodes at 600 \u00b0C based on symmetric cells test. Peak power density of \u223c1150 mW cm \u22122 is reached for a thin-film electrolyte cell with BSCN cathode at 600 \u00b0C, which is higher than a similar cell with SCN cathode (\u223c1008 mW cm \u22122 ). BSCN is a promising cathode material for oxygen-ionic IT-SOFCs. Keywords Perovskite Cathode Solid-oxide fuel cells Mixed conductors 1 Introduction Ceramic oxides with mixed oxygen-ionic and electronic conductivity are a type of functional material that can conduct oxide ions and electrons simultaneously at elevated temperatures. These materials have potential applications such as dense ceramic membranes for oxygen separation from air or as membrane reactors for coupling the oxidation of light hydrocarbons to value-added products [1\u20134] . Many mixed conducting composite oxides have been developed for ceramic oxygen separation membranes with high oxygen permeability at elevated temperatures [5\u201310] . However, during the past decade, mixed conducting oxides have also received considerable attention as cathode materials of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) [11\u201316] . In SOFCs, with electrodes composed of pure electronic conductors such as La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM), oxygen reduction is limited to the electrode\u2013electrolyte\u2013air triple phase boundary (TPB) region. However, the active site is effectively extended to the entire exposed cathode surface if a mixed conductor is used as the cathode material. Consequently, the electrode activity for oxygen reduction may be improved over the LSM electrode, especially at reduced temperatures. Over the past several years, we have demonstrated that mixed conductors that show high oxygen permeability at elevated temperatures perform well as cathodes of SOFCs at intermediate temperatures [17\u201321] . For example, Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) composite oxide was initially developed as a material for high-temperature oxygen separation membranes [17] . However, BSCF was later demonstrated to be a highly promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs), with high activity for oxygen reduction at temperatures of 500\u2013600 \u00b0C [18] . Fig. 1 shows schematically the reduction of oxygen over a mixed conducting electrode and oxygen permeation through a dense mixed conducting ceramic membrane. Both processes involve the surface exchange and bulk diffusion of oxygen. However, for oxygen separation applications, the ceramic membranes are typically dense membranes with a thickness at the millimeter level. The mixed conductors are prepared as a porous structure with an effective thickness of only about 20 \u03bcm when used as cathodes of SOFCs for oxygen reduction. This implies the importance of surface exchange and bulk diffusion in mixed conductors, which may play a different role in ceramic oxygen separation membranes and in cathodes of IT-SOFCs. Knowledge about the bulk diffusion and surface exchange properties of mixed conductors would be useful for practical applications. To perform well as a cathode, in addition to a high electrochemical activity for the reduction of oxygen, the material should have a comparable thermal-expansion coefficient (TEC) to the electrolyte, high resistance to reacting with the electrolyte and good electronic conductivity for efficient current collection. Recently, strontium niobium cobaltite composite oxides have received much attention as materials in oxygen separation membranes. In particular, SrCo 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SCN) was found to possess high chemical stability and oxygen permeability at elevated temperatures [22\u201324] . Recently, we found that SCN is also a good cathode material for IT-SOFCs. By operating on hydrogen fuel, a peak power density (PPD) of 1008 mW cm \u22122 was achieved for a cell with a thin-film SDC electrolyte (\u223c20 \u03bcm), a Ni + SDC anode and a SCN cathode at 600 \u00b0C [25] . Very recently, we demonstrated that the oxygen permeability of the membrane was further improved through partial substitution of Sr 2+ in SCN by Ba 2+ to yield Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCN), a novel perovskite-type oxide [26] . In this study, the potential application of BSCN as a cathode material in IT-SOFCs with a doped ceria electrolyte was systematically investigated. The chemical diffusion coefficient and surface exchange constant of BSCN and SCN were studied, as well as the reactivity with the SDC electrolyte at high temperatures, the TEC, the conductivity under various atmospheres and the performance of the electrode. The results indicate that BSCN is a highly promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs with SDC electrolyte. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis SDC oxide powder was synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. Metal nitrates of Sm(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O and Ce(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O were prepared from a mixed solution of Sm 2+ and Ce 4+ with a molar ratio of 1:4. EDTA and citric acid were added to the solution to serve as complexing agents with a molar ratio of total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid set at 1:1:2. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6 with NH 4 OH and the water was evaporated slowly from the solution by heating at 90 \u00b0C until a transparent gel was obtained, which was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and further calcined at 800 \u00b0C in air for 5 h to yield the final products with the desired lattice structure. BSCN and SCN composite oxides were synthesized by a mechano-chemical activation-enhanced solid phase reaction with BaCO 3 , SrCO 3 , Nb 2 O 5 and Co 2 O 3 as raw materials and cation sources. The chemicals were weighed and mixed thoroughly using a high-energy ball miller (Fritsch, Pulverisette 6) at a rotational speed of 400 rpm for 3 h in liquid acetone. The slurry was dried in an electrical oven to obtain a solid precursor, which was calcined in air in a two-step procedure, first at 950 \u00b0C for 10 h and then at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h, to yield the final products with the desired lattice structure. 2.2 Symmetric cell and fuel cell fabrication To prepare the symmetric cells for impedance spectroscopy measurements, the BSCN powder was dispersed in a premixed solution of glycol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol and a colloidal suspension was formed through the use of a high-energy ball miller at a rotational speed of 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The suspension was then symmetrically painted on both surfaces of dense SDC pellets with a diameter of \u223c13 mm and a thickness of \u223c0.8 mm and the whole cells were calcined at 950\u20131100 \u00b0C. Anode-supported single cells for I \u2013 V polarization tests were fabricated by dry pressing/sintering of the anode\u2013electrolyte dual-layer cells and spray deposition/firing of the cathode layer. Anode powder, composed of 60 wt.% NiO and 40 wt.% SDC, was pressed into a substrate disk using a stainless steel die under a hydraulic pressure of 120 MPa. Next, SDC powder calcined at 800 \u00b0C was distributed over the anode surface homogenously and pressed at 240 MPa to form a green dual-layer cell. The cell was sintered at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h to achieve densification of the electrolyte layer and a firm connection between the anode and the electrolyte layers. The cathode layer was deposited over the electrolyte surface by air-driven spray deposition of a cathode colloidal suspension. Next calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h was conducted to form a well-connected cathode network and good adhesion of the cathode layer to the electrolyte layer. The resulting coin-shaped cathode had an effective geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 . 2.3 Basic characterization XRD patterns of the powders were analyzed by a diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). Diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning angles (2 \u03b8 ) between 20 and 80\u00b0. The microscopic features of the sintered electrodes were characterized by an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). Electrical conductivity was measured using a four-probe DC technique under various atmospheres, using Ag paste as a current collector. Prepared powders were ball-milled and subsequently pressed into green bars (8 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm) with a stainless steel die under a hydraulic pressure of 200 MPa. The green bar was densified by sintering at 1120 \u00b0C for 5 h. Silver paste was applied to each bar and four wires were attached to the edge of the bar as a current and voltage probe. Measurements were conducted by a Keithley 2420 meter with a temperature interval of 10 \u00b0C, from 300 to 900 \u00b0C. The TEC of the sintered sample was measured by a dilatometer (Netsch DLL 402C/3/G) from room temperature to 900 \u00b0C, with an air-purge flow rate of 50 ml min \u22121 [standard temperature and pressure, STP]. To conduct the oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) experiment, 0.15 g of oxide powder was placed inside a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of approximately 3 mm. A K-type thermocouple was placed near the oxide powders for temperature control and monitoring. High purity helium (>99.99%) was introduced to the reactor at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP]. After flushing the system with helium for 30 min at room temperature to eliminate weakly absorbed species on the surface, the reactor was heated to 930 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . During the heating process, oxygen was released from the oxide lattice and collected by the helium and sent to the mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC-20) for in-situ analysis. 2.4 Electrical conductivity relaxation The D chem and k ex were obtained by the electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) method. A bar with dimensions of 8 mm \u00d7 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm was mechanically polished and ultrasonically cleaned prior to the ECR test. The bar was heated in an electrical furnace at a certain temperature under a controlled atmosphere. After stabilization, a sudden change in the oxygen partial pressure, from 0.05 to 0.21 atm, was achieved by switching to another gas. The time dependence of conductivity was measured using a four-probe DC technique. The change in the oxygen partial pressure was achieved by mixing the proper amount of argon and oxygen with mass flow controllers at a flow rate of 300 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The test was conducted between 600 and 450 \u00b0C, at an interval of 50 \u00b0C. After each change in temperature, the bar was stabilized for at least 1 h. 2.5 Electrochemical characterization The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the cells were characterized by an electrochemical workstation Solatron 1287 potentiostat and a 1260A frequency analyzer in a frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz, with single amplitude of 10 mV under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions. The oxygen partial pressure was varied between 0.04 and 1 atm. by mixing O 2 (99.99%) and N 2 (99.999%) with mass flow controllers at a flow rate of 200 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The sample was heated to 650 \u00b0C and tested between 650 and 450 \u00b0C, at an interval of 50 \u00b0C. The impedance data were collected using Z-View 2.9c software and analyzed by a complex nonlinear least-square (CNLS) fitting program via Z-Plot 2.9c software. 2.6 I \u2013 V polarization test An in-house constructed fuel cell test station was applied for electrochemical performance evaluation of the fabricated cells. The cell was sealed onto a quartz reactor with humidified (3% H 2 O) hydrogen at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP], while ambient air was applied to the cathode atmosphere. I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected at an interval of 50 \u00b0C over a temperature range of 600\u2013450 \u00b0C using a digital source meter (Model 2420, Keithley, USA) based on the four-probe configuration. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural compatibility with SDC electrolyte To prepare the membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs), the cathode material was deposited onto an electrolyte surface by various physical or chemical techniques. The cells that contain the cathode layer were further fired at an elevated temperature to allow for the firm adhesion of the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface and a tight connection between the electrode particles to minimize contact resistance. However, an interfacial reaction between the electrolyte and cathode layers may occur during the high-temperature firing process. The interfacial layer may cause a diffusion barrier for oxygen ions or protons and lead to a serious deterioration in the performance of the electrode. The potential phase reaction between BSCN and SDC was investigated by powder reaction, where equal weights of BSCN and SDC in powder form were mixed thoroughly and calcined in air at various temperatures between 950 and 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. The resultant products were later subjected to XRD characterization. As shown in Fig. 2 , all samples calcined at different temperatures yielded diffraction peaks that indicated a physical mixture of a perovskite-type BSCN-related phase and a fluorite-type SDC-related phase. Furthermore, there is no obvious peak shift of the BSCN-related phase and the SDC-related phase when compared to single-phase BSCN and SDC respectively. This implies that the phase reaction between BSCN and SDC is not significant at all firing temperatures. As mentioned, the phase reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte may result in the formation of an interfacial layer [27] . To further exploit the potential phase reaction between BSCN and SDC, a porous layer of BSCN was deposited onto the electrolyte surface. The dual-layer cell was then calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h and subjected to SEM for observation. Shown in Fig. 3 are the micrographs of the dual-layer cell from a cross-sectional view. The BSCN layer is attached to the electrolyte surface, suggesting good thermo-mechanical compatibility. There is also no evidence of an obvious interfacial layer between the BSCN cathode and the SDC electrolyte. The results support the absence of a significant phase reaction between BSCN and SDC during the high-temperature fabrication. 3.2 TEC For practical applications, the cell components should have comparable TEC values. Large differences in TECs may lead a large internal stress induced during the heating and cooling processes, which may negatively affect the cell operational stability. Doped ceria electrolytes typically have a TEC of 11\u201312 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 [28] . Cobalt-based perovskite oxides usually have a high TEC [29\u201332] . For example, BSCF has a reported TEC of >21 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 between 30 and 1000 \u00b0C [31] . Previously, we have demonstrated that the TEC of cobalt-contained perovskite oxides is strongly affected by the dopant and cation stoichiometry [22,33] . Dilatometric measurements up to 900 \u00b0C were conducted in air to investigate the thermal-expansion behavior of the BSCN oxide. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding thermal-expansion curve of BSCN and the SCN thermal-expansion curve for comparison. The average TEC values for SCN and BSCN in temperature ranges of 200\u2013500, 200\u2013600, 500\u2013900 and 200\u2013900 \u00b0C are presented in Table 1 . For both BSCN and SCN samples, the thermal-expansion curve can be separated into two regions with different slopes, with a transition at 500 \u00b0C. For cobalt perovskite oxides such as BSCN, the thermal-expansion could be due to several aspects, including thermal activation of the compositional cations, the electronic spin-state transition associated with the transition from low spin-state ( t 2 g 6 e g 0 ) to high spin-state ( t 2 g 4 e g 2 ) Co 3+ ions and chemical expansion due to the thermal reduction of cobalt ions to a lower valence state. It is well known that cobalt can be thermally reduced to a lower valence state at intermediate temperatures and lead to the simultaneous production of oxygen vacancies and an increase in the ionic size of cobalt. To interpret the transition of thermal-expansion behavior at 500 \u00b0C, O 2 -TPD analysis of BSCN powder was conducted. As shown in Fig. 5 , at 500 \u00b0C, a large desorption peak was observed for BSCN, indicating the loss of oxygen in the lattice. The release of oxygen from the oxide was accompanied by the reduction of cobalt to a lower valence state, to maintain electrical charge neutrality. This implies that the change in thermal-expansion behavior at 500 \u00b0C was due to the thermal reduction of cobalt in the composite oxide. Within the temperature range of 200\u2013500, 500\u2013900 and 200\u2013900 \u00b0C, a calculated TEC of 14.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 21.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 18.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 was obtained for BSCN, respectively. As a comparison, the corresponding TEC values were 18.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 22.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 20.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 for SCN. The TEC of BSCN was lower than SCN and this is attributed to a smaller loss of oxygen during the heating process, as demonstrated by our previous temperature-programmed oxygen desorption analysis [26] . The thermal-expansion behavior of BSCN and SCN is highly dependent on the investigated temperature range. A sharp increase in TEC was observed at temperatures higher than 500 \u00b0C due to an increase in the chemically induced expansion as previously demonstrated. The small TEC of BSCN between 200 and 500 \u00b0C suggests that BSCN is a highly promising cathode for SOFC at operating temperatures less than 500 \u00b0C. 3.3 Electrical conductivity Sufficient electronic conductivity under real operating conditions is of significant importance for the practical application of fuel cell electrodes. Although the fuel cell cathode is typically exposed to an air atmosphere, consumption of oxygen is large at high polarization current densities. Under these conditions, the oxygen potential at the cathode surface could be much lower than the surrounding atmosphere (air). For example, at cathode overpotential of 0.2 V, the apparent oxygen partial pressure over the cathode surface is as low as 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 atm. when the cathode is exposed to an air atmosphere at 600 \u00b0C. Because the cathode overpotential increases with an increase in polarization current density, a high electronic conductivity at reduced oxygen concentration is of critical importance to minimize contact resistance. As shown in Fig. 6 , the electrical conductivity of BSCN varies under different oxygen partial pressures and as a function of temperature. Since the electronic conductivity overwhelms the oxygen-ionic conductivity, the reported electrical conductivity reflects the electronic conductivity. For the perovskite oxide, the electronic conduction is created by polaron hopping between the B-site cations and the oxygen ions via a mechanism similar to the Zerner double exchange process [19] . A conductivity of 23\u201340 S cm \u22121 was measured for BSCN in air between 300 and 900 \u00b0C, which is smaller than the conductivity of SCN, which is 120\u201380 S cm \u22121 [26] . For Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 composite oxides, we have demonstrated that the increase in Ba 2+ content in the composite leads to a decrease in the electrical conductivity. This is due to an increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies within the oxide lattice, which causes a barrier for electron hopping between the B-site cations and oxygen ions [9] . A similar explanation can be applied to BSCN. An increase in electrical conductivity with temperature was observed for BSCN in air and other atmospheres with different oxygen partial pressures, demonstrating semiconductor-like behavior. Previously, we observed that SCN displayed metallic conduction behavior in air, which is characterized by a decrease in conductivity with temperature [24] . This suggests that the partial substitution of Sr 2+ in SCN by Ba 2+ altered the mechanism of electrical conduction in the composite oxide. A decrease in electrical conductivity was observed with reduced oxygen partial pressure for BSCN, suggesting P-type electronic conducting behavior. At an oxygen partial pressure of 10 \u22122 atm, which is equal to an over potential of 0.057 V for the cathode in air, an electrical conductivity of 13\u201334 S cm \u22121 was maintained. This is only slightly lower than in an air atmosphere. 3.4 D chem and k ex The electrode performance is closely related to the intrinsic properties of the electrode material, such as surface exchange kinetics and bulk diffusion properties. The chemical diffusion coefficient ( D chem ) and surface exchange coefficient ( k ex ) of BSCN and SCN were comparatively studied by an electrical conductivity relaxation technique. Fig. 7 shows the electrical conductivity relaxation curves of SCN and BSCN oxides at 600 \u00b0C by a sudden change in the oxygen partial pressure from 0.05 to 0.21 atm.

At each temperature, k ex is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the D chem for BSCN and SCN. This suggests excellent surface exchange properties. Both the D chem and k ex for BSCN are larger than SCN, which suggests that BSCN may have higher electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction than SCN. 3.5 Symmetric cell performance To demonstrate the electrochemical activity of BSCN for oxygen reduction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of a symmetric cell with BSCN electrodes was measured in air under OCV conditions. Fig. 8 a presents a typical impedance spectrum at 600 \u00b0C in the Nyquist plot. The spectrum contains a tail at high-frequency, which is attributed to the inductance of the cell and at least two depressed semicircle. The high-frequency intercept of the impedance spectrum with the real axis gives the ohmic resistance of electrodes and the electrolyte, while the low-frequency intercept gives the total resistance of the cell ( R ohm + R P ). The difference between the intercept of the impedance spectrum with the real axis at high-frequency and the intercept at low-frequency represents the polarization resistance ( R P ) of the two symmetric electrodes. Here the reported values have been obtained dividing by two the experimentally measured values in order to obtain the resistances of the single electrodes layer. Fig. 8 b shows the temperature dependence of R P for various BSCN electrodes fired at different temperatures in an Arrhenius plot. The firing temperature was found to have little influence on the ohmic resistance of the cell for a calcination temperature between 950 and 1050 \u00b0C. This implies the phase reaction between BSCN and SDC is not significant, which is in agreement with the powder reaction results, as shown in Fig. 2 . Because there is no obvious phase reaction between BSCN and SDC, the increase in R P at a calcination temperature of 1100 \u00b0C may be due to electrode sintering. After the firing at 1000 \u00b0C, a polarization resistance of around 0.1 \u03a9 cm \u22122 was achieved for BSCN at 600 \u00b0C, which is comparable to the BSCF (0.055\u20130.071 \u03a9 cm \u22122 ) [18] and SCN (0.094 \u03a9 cm \u22122 ) [25] values reported in the literature and measured under similar conditions. The cathodic polarization resistance may be due to charge transfer across the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface and/or the air\u2013electrode interface. The resistance may also be due to surface processes including oxygen surface adsorption, dissociation and surface diffusion. Based on results in the literature, the high-frequency arc is likely associated with an ion charge transfer process at the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface. The high-to-intermediate frequency arc is associated with the charge transfer process at the air\u2013electrode interface and the intermediate-to-low-frequency arc is caused by oxygen surface adsorption, dissociation and surface diffusion [35\u201338] . It was found that the EIS of BSCN contains two separable depressed arcs, which can be fitted into an equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 9 a . The corresponding polarization resistances associated with these two arcs are designated R E1 and R E2 , respectively. The temperature dependence of R E1 and R E2 at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 9 b. From the figure, it is observed that R E2 overwhelms R E1 , which indicates that the rate-limiting step is related to the process that occurs at the intermediate-to-low-frequency range. To obtain more insight into the oxygen reduction reaction over the electrode, the characteristic frequency f (which is a very useful tool for identifying oxygen reduction reaction processes), was calculated based on the equation f = ( R T 1 / p ) \u2212 1 / p / 2 \u03c0 [35,37] . Table 3 summarizes the fitted and calculated parameters as a function of the oxygen partial pressure under zero DC bias conditions at 600 \u00b0C. It was observed that the values of f for the high-frequency arc are similar to the reported values for oxide-ion transfer through the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface [35,37] . The angular relaxation frequency of the intermediate frequency arc is between 9 and 42 Hz, which is in the typical range for a charge transfer process that occurs over the air\u2013electrode interface [36] . Therefore, the first arc at the high-frequency range is likely associated with oxygen ion charge transfer across the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface, while the second arc is likely related to charge transfer at the air\u2013electrode interface. To further clarify the oxygen reduction processes over the BSCN electrode, the electrode polarization resistance of BSCN was investigated under various oxygen partial pressures. In Fig. 10 , the typical EIS in Nyquist plots (a) and the Ln \u2061 P O 2 dependence of Ln(1/ R P ) is shown in Fig. 10 (b\u2013d). For different processes, there is a unique dependence of Ln(1/ R P ) with respect to Ln \u2061 P O 2 . A value of 0.5, 0.25 or 0 is associated with the following reactions respectively [36] . O 2 , ads \u21d4 2 O 0,ads \u2003 ( Oxygen surface adsorption, dissociation and surface diffusion ) O ads + V 0 , electrode \u2022 \u2022 + 2 e \u2032 \u21d4 O 0 , electrode \u00d7 \u2003 ( Surface diffusion and charge transfer ) O 0 , electrode \u00d7 + V 0 , electrolyte \u2022 \u2022 \u21d4 O 0 , electrode \u00d7 + V 0 , electrode \u2022 \u2022 \u2003 ( Ion charge transfer ) Between 450 and 650 \u00b0C, a value of 0 for R E1 indicates a process involving ion charge transfer from electrode to electrolyte [36] . A slope of approximately 0.31 for R E2 was obtained for the BSCN electrode. This implies that the contribution of polarization resistances, R E2 , is mainly due to the charge transfer process. It further suggests that oxygen reduction over the BSCN electrode is rate-limited by the relatively slow charge transfer process due to its low electrical conductivity. 3.6 Single cell performance To test the cathodic performance of BSCN under real fuel cell conditions, an anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cell with an Ni + SDC anode (\u223c600 \u03bcm), SDC electrolyte (\u223c20 \u03bcm) and BSCN cathode (\u223c40 \u03bcm) was fabricated. Shown in Fig. 11 a are the typical I \u2013 V polarization curves of the fuel cells at various temperatures. The corresponding EIS of the cell under OCV conditions are shown in Fig. 11 b. A peak power density of \u223c1150 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C, which is higher than reported similar cells with common cathode materials for oxygen-ionic SOFCs, for example, a peak power density of 422 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C by Leng et al. with a composite cathode of LSCF and GDC [39] . However, at high polarization current density (>3 A cm \u22122 ), a significant concentration polarization occurred due to insufficient cathode porosity. At temperatures below 550 \u00b0C, a linear response of the cell voltage to the polarization current density suggests that the concentration polarization disappeared. At 450 \u00b0C, a peak power density of 300 mW cm \u22122 was achieved. Compared to the results for similar fuel cells with SCN as the cathode [25] , the fuel cell with the BSCN cathode delivered a slightly higher performance. As shown in Fig. 11 b, under OCV conditions, the cell resistance at 600 and 550 \u00b0C is mainly due to the ohmic resistance. This implies that a reduction in the thickness of the electrolyte may further increase the cell power output. At 450 \u00b0C, the electrode polarization resistance (0.33 \u03a9 cm \u22122 ) is comparable to the electrolyte ohmic resistance (\u223c0.32 \u03a9 cm \u22122 ). Fig. 12 shows the SEM photo of the cell after the I \u2013 V polarization test from a cross-sectional view. The cathode layer is denser than the anode layer, which explains the appearance of concentration polarization at high current density at 600 \u00b0C. After the fuel cell test, the cathode still adhered to the electrolyte surface without evidence of delamination. This suggests that the BSCN cathode matched the SDC electrolyte. This is likely due to the small difference in TEC for BSCN and SCN ( Fig. 4 ) between 200 and 600 \u00b0C. 4 Conclusions BSCN was successfully used as a cathode for a SOFC operated at temperatures between 450 and 600 \u00b0C. The phase reaction between BSCN and SDC is not significant at temperatures up to 1100 \u00b0C based on the powder reaction test. There is also no evidence of an interfacial layer between the BSCN cathode and the SDC electrolyte according to SEM results. The relatively small TEC (14.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 , 200\u2013500 \u00b0C) of BSCN ensured the attachment of the BSCN cathode layer to the SDC electrolyte surface, even after fuel cell operations. Through the electricity conductivity relaxation test, BSCN proved to have a higher D chem and k ex than SCN. Although oxygen reduction over the BSCN electrode is rate-limited by the relatively slow charge transfer process due to its low electrical conductivity (which is 23\u201340 S cm \u22121 in air between 300 and 900 \u00b0C), a small electrode polarization resistance of around 0.1 \u03a9 cm \u22122 was achieved for the BSCN cathode at 600 \u00b0C, which is comparable to BSCF and SCN cathodes. At 600 \u00b0C, a thin-film electrolyte SOFC with a BSCN cathode delivered a peak power density of \u223c1150 mW cm \u22122 . At 450 \u00b0C, a peak power density of 300 mW cm \u22122 was also achieved. These results suggest that BSCN is a highly promising cathode for IT-SOFCs with a SDC electrolyte.

        "abstract": "Sm0.5Sr0.5MO3-\u03b4 (M = Co and Mn) materials are synthesized, and their properties and performance as cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) on Sm0.2Ce0.8O 1.9 (SDC) and Y0.16Zr0.92O2.08 (YSZ) electrolytes are comparatively studied. The phase structure, thermal expansion behavior, oxygen mobility, oxygen vacancy concentration and electrical conductivity of the oxides are systematically investigated. Sm 0.5Sr0.5CoO3-\u03b4 (SSC) has a much larger oxygen vacancy concentration, electrical conductivity and TEC than Sm 0.5Sr0.5MnO3-\u03b4 (SSM). A powder reaction demonstrates that SSM is more chemically compatible with the YSZ electrolyte than SSC, while both are compatible with the SDC electrolyte. EIS results indicate that the performances of SSC and SSM electrodes depend on the electrolyte that they are deposited on. SSC is suitable for the SDC electrolyte, while SSM is preferred for the YSZ electrolyte. A peak power density as high as 690 mW cm-2 at 600\u00b0C is observed for a thin-film SDC electrolyte with SSC cathode, while a similar cell with YSZ electrolyte performs poorly. However, SSM performs well on YSZ electrolyte at an operation temperature of higher than 700\u00b0C, and a fuel cell with SSM cathode and a thin-film YSZ electrolyte delivers a peak power density of \u223c590 mW cm-2 at 800\u00b0C. The poor performances of SSM cathode on both YSZ and SDC electrolytes are obtained at a temperature of lower than 650\u00b0C. Copyright \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 is a material with multiple phase structures. The influence of Sc 3+ doping in the B-site of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 on its lattice structure/phase stability, electrical conductivity, and cathode performance for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) was investigated by X-ray diffraction, four-probe dc conductivity and impedance spectroscopy measurements, respectively. The introduction of large-size Sc 3+ (0.745 \u00c5) cation together with the sol\u2013gel synthesis technique, led to a substantial stabilization of the cubic phase of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 \u2014even at a Sc 3+ doping amount as low as 5 mol%. Such stabilization resulted in a sharp increase in the electrical conductivity of the material, which was found to be p-type in nature. A maximum electrical conductivity and favourable cubic phase stability of the material was reached at the Sc 3+ doping concentration of 5\u201310 mol%. A further increase of Sc 3+ doping, however, lowered the electrical conductivity due to the blocking effect of Sc 3+ for the electron conduction. An area specific resistance (ASR) as low as 0.25 \u03a9cm 2 was reached at 600 \u00b0C for SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 as a cathode material based on Sm 0.15 Ce 0.85 O 1.925 electrolyte. Keywords Oxygen permeation membrane Scandium Perovskite Cathode SOFC 1 Introduction SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 composite is an important parent compound for the development of a series of functional materials. Depending on the doping component and level, the material can display mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) [1] , ferromaganetic [2] , or thermo-electrical properties [3] . MIEC oxides are important functional materials for many applications, such as oxygen separation membranes [4\u20136] , cathode/anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells [7,8] , and combustion catalysts [9] . Depending on the operation temperature, oxygen partial pressure of the environment, thermal history, and synthesis methods, strontium cobaltite may display 2-H type hexagonal perovskite, oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite, rhombohedral perovskite, or cubic perovskite structure [10\u201314] . Further studies turned out that the phase structure and electrical conductivity of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide was closely related with the oxygen content in the composite, which could take a wide range of variation [15] . Among the various phase structures of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , the oxide with the cubic phase shows the highest electronic and oxygen ionic conductivity with a maximum reported total electrical conductivity of \u223c160 S cm \u22121 at \u223c950 \u00b0C [10] . A 1.5 mm thick membrane made from SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide with the cubic lattice structure demonstrated an ultrahigh oxygen permeation flux of 2.0 ml/cm 2 min [STP] under an air/helium oxygen partial pressure gradient at 950 \u00b0C, which is higher than the permeation fluxes of SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [16] and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [17] membranes under similar conditions, the two materials with the highest reported oxygen permeability. The derived oxygen ionic conductivity of the cubic phase SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 based on the permeation flux reached as high as 2.5 S cm \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C [10] , which is several orders of magnitude higher than the typical high oxygen ionic conducting electrolyte of yttrium stabilized zirconia [18] . For the other phases of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , the conductivity was substantially lower. The strategy of substitution, either via the A or B-site, has therefore been extensively applied in order to stabilize the cubic lattice structure of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 [19,20] . The B-site doping is more favourable for preserving the high oxygen vacancy concentration of the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 parent, and therefore ensuring the higher ionic conductivity [20] . In this paper we report the efficient stabilization of the cubic phase of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 by low concentration of Sc 3+ doping in the B-site of perovskite combined with sol\u2013gel synthesis. A minor amount of Sc 3+ substitution, as low as \u223c5 mol%, for cobalt ion together with the homogeneous sol\u2013gel synthesis process, effectively preserved the cubic perovskite structure of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 to room temperature. The new derived materials displayed high electrical conductivity and reduced oxygen vacancy variations as compared with the undoped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and other doped compounds such as SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 . The primary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the symmetric cell with Sc 3+ doped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 as the electrode, demonstrated their potential application as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.2) composite oxides were synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 x H 2 O, and Sc 2 O 3 (all in A.R. grade) were applied as the raw materials for the metal-ion sources. For the preparation of SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.2), the necessary amount of Sc 2 O 3 was weighed and dissolved in HNO 3 aqueous solution under heating; Sr(NO 3 ) 2 solid and Co(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution was added at the required stoichiometry followed by the introduction of EDTA and citric acid as complexing agents. The pH value of the system was controlled at \u223c6 with the help of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O. After the evaporation of the water under heating, a transparent purple gel was obtained, which was then pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C to result in a solid precursor and followed by calcined at various temperatures under air for 5 h to get the final products. 2.2 Phase structure and stability test The phase structure of the samples was investigated using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. For the phase stability tests, the samples were put into a U-type quartz tube and treated at high temperatures (800\u20131100 \u00b0C) under controlled atmosphere (O 2 , air or Ar) for a certain period (5\u2013100 h). After the treatment, the sample was cooled down to room temperature under the same atmosphere for phase structure examination. 2.3 Electrical conductivity measurement The electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe dc method on sintered bars of approximate dimensions 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm. The measurements were performed under controlled atmosphere upon cooling from 900 to 300 \u00b0C, 5 \u00b0C/step. At each temperature step, 2 min was allowed for the conductivity stabilization. Silver paste was painted on the square cross-sectional edges of the sample or along the rectangular edges (separated by a distance L ) to form current and voltage electrodes. Two silver wires acted as current contacts and the other two sliver wires as the voltage contacts, were attached to the electrodes using silver paste. The sample was placed in a vertical split tube furnace. A constant current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage response on the two voltage wires was recorded using a Keithley 2420 Sourcemeter. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to a maximum value of 2 A. The conductivity was calculated based on the following equation: (1) \u03c3 = L A \u00d7 K where A is the cross-sectional area, L is the distance between probes, and K is the slope of the curve of current versus voltage. 2.4 Impedance spectroscopy of symmetric cells Symmetric cell configuration was used for the investigation of cathode performance of SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 for IT-SOFCs. The electrolyte substrate Sm 0.15 Ce 0.85 O 1.925 with a diameter of 12.93 mm and thickness of 1.0 mm was produced by dry pressing and sintered at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h. Two nominally identical cathodes (1.21 cm 2 ) were deposited on each side of the electrolyte pellet by painting method and calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h under static air atmosphere. Impedance measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation based on Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer together with 1287 Potentiostat/Galvanostat. The two-electrode cells were tested at open circuit voltage. In general, the electrochemical tests were performed from 800 to 500 \u00b0C in 25 \u00b0C intervals under stagnant air atmosphere with a frequency range of 0.01\u201310 5 Hz and applied ac voltage amplitude of 10 mV. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure and stability Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides calcined at various temperature for 5 h under air, and the samples with further treatment of the 850 \u00b0C calcined sample in O 2 or argon ( P O 2 = 10 \u2212 5 \u2009 atm ) at 800 \u00b0C for 5 h. We found that all the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 samples displayed the typical 2-H type hexagonal perovskite structure, regardless of the calcination temperature and atmosphere during calcination. The further treatment of the sample under oxidized (oxygen, P O 2 = 1 \u2009 atm ) or reduced atmospheres (argon, P O 2 \u223c 10 \u2212 5 \u2009 atm ) still did not lead to the occurrence of the cubic perovskite. Because the 2-H structure has a low electrical conductivity, it has less practical importance. Sc 3+ was then introduced for the partial substitution of the cobalt ion in SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 to stabilize its more important cubic phase. Fig. 2 shows the room-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns of the sol\u2013gel derived SrSc 0.02 Co 0.98 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 precursor calcined at various temperatures for 5 h. For the 850 \u00b0C calcined sample, the similar 2-H type hexagonal perovskite structure as SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 was observed, while a mixture of oxygen vacancies-ordered brownmillerite and cubic perovskite was observed at a calcination temperature of 1100 \u00b0C or higher. Unfortunately, the cubic structure was converted to the 2-H type hexagonal structure when the sample was further calcined at a lower temperature in air. It suggests that a 2 mol% doping amount of Sc 3+ was insufficient to stabilize the cubic phase structure. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 with Sc 3+ doping concentration varied from 0 to 20 mol% (the highest Sc 3+ doping concentration investigated in this study). When the Sc 3+ doping concentration was increased to 5 mol% or higher, a pure cubic perovskite phase was achieved by calcination of the sol\u2013gel precursor at a temperature as low as 850 \u00b0C. It is well known that the lattice structure of perovskite is closely related with the tolerance factor, defined as t = ( R A + R O ) / 2 ( R B + R O ) , where R A , R B and R O represent the ionic radius of the A-site metal ion (12-coordination), the B-site cation (6-coordination), and the oxygen ion (1.4 \u00c5), respectively. The perovskite structure can be maintained typically at 0.75 \u2264 t \u2264 1.0. At other situations, the internal stress introduced due to the mismatch of the A and B-site ions was so large that the perovskite structure could not survive. For SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , Sr 2+ and Sc 3+ have a fixed ionic radius of 1.44 \u00c5 (A-site, 12-coordination), and 0.745 \u00c5 (B-site, 6-coordination), respectively, while the ionic radius of cobalt was variable since cobalt ion could take multiple valence states (2+, 3+, 4+) and different spin types (high and low). Therefore, the average ionic radius of the B-site ions in SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite would be determined by the relative concentration of the respective types of cobalt ions. At the minor Sc 3+ doping concentration of 2\u20135 mol%, the effect of Sc 3+ itself on the B-site ionic radius was negligible; the influence of Sc 3+ doping on the phase structure was embodied through its impact on the valence state and spin type of B-site cobalt ions. Based on the results in Figs. 2 and 3 , the introduction of minor amount of Sc 3+ could likely lead to the stabilization of the lower valence state and/or the high spin type of cobalt ion(s), since the tolerance factor of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 is larger than 1. Table 1 shows the lattice constant of SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 at various Sc 3+ doping concentrations. The increase of the Sc 3+ doping concentration led to the slightly increase of the lattice constant. The mean B-site ionic radius for the samples with varied Sc 3+ doping concentration were then calculated based on the measured lattice constants, while the average cobalt ionic radius at the B-site of the perovskite was calculated based on the average B-site ionic radius and the Sc 3+ concentration. The increase of the Sc 3+ doping concentration resulted in the decrease of the average radius size of cobalt ion. Therefore, an increase in the average valence state of cobalt or an increase in the percentage of the low spin type cobalt occurred with the increase of Sc 3+ doping concentration. It suggests that the stabilization effect of Sc 3+ doping on the lower valence state and/or the high spin type of cobalt was weakened with the increase of Sc 3+ doping concentration. To determine whether the observed phases of SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.05\u20130.2) represent the stable equilibrium phases, the samples were treated at 800 \u00b0C under air for a sufficient long time (100 h) and then examined by the room-temperature X-ray diffraction measurement. As shown in Fig. 4 , the cubic phases survived for the Sc 3+ doping concentration of 5\u201320 mol% ( x = 0.05\u20130.2), whereas it reverted to the 2-H perovskite structure for the sample with Sc 3+ doping concentration of 2 mol% ( x = 0.02). Therefore, a Sc 3+ doping amount of \u22655 mol% is critical to stabilize the cubic phase of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 . Maignan et al. reported the synthesis of SrCo 1\u2212 x Sc x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (0 < x \u2264 0.5) by the solid-state reaction at 1100 \u00b0C. However, they were not able to get a pure cubic perovskite phase at Sc 3+ doping concentration of \u226425 mol% ( x \u2264 0.25). The SrCo 0.9 Sc 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 sample prepared in their research displayed an orthorhombic structure in the 2 a p 1 \u00d7 2 a p 2 \u00d7 4 a p supercell [21] . It suggests that the preparation method could have significant effect on the phase structure of the doped composite oxide. For the current sol\u2013gel process, it takes the advantage of the raw material homogeneously mixed at the molecule level; therefore Sc 3+ could be evenly distributed inside the lattice structure of the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide. While for the solid-state reaction, due to the in-homogeneity in micro-domains and the low concentration of the Sc 3+ dopant, Sc 3+ could be in-homogeneously distributed inside the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 lattice, and resulted in the appearance of the different phase structures. 3.2 Electrical conductivity An electrical conductivity of 3\u201330 S cm \u22121 was observed for SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 under air atmosphere between 300 and 900 \u00b0C. The conductivity slightly improved with the increase of the operation temperature. It is interesting to note that the oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere (i.e., O 2 , air or Ar) did not have much effect on the electrical conductivity of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 . . Table 2 shows the maximum and minimum electrical conductivities of SrSc x Co 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.2) under oxygen, air and argon atmospheres. It demonstrates that a minor amount of Sc 3+ doping resulted in the sharp increase of the conductivity of the compound. For example, the composite reached the maximum conductivity of \u223c301 S cm \u22121 at 300 \u00b0C under air at the Sc 3+ doping concentration of 5 mol%. However, with the further increase in doping concentration, a decrease of conductivity was observed. Different from the undoped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , the Sc 3+ doped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 samples displayed the metal-like conductivity mechanism, i.e., a decrease in conductivity with the increase of the operation temperature. For the Sc 3+ doped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , the conductivity under argon ( P O 2 = \u223c 10 \u2212 5 \u2009 atm ) was much lower than that under oxygen or air atmosphere. For the perovskite oxide, the conductivity is closely related with its phase structure and the characteristics of the variable metal ion(s) at the B-site. The electron conduction was created by B-site lattice cations through strongly overlapping B\u2013O\u2013B bonds with a mechanism like the Zerner double exchange process as shown below: B n + \u2013O 2\u2212 \u2013B ( n +1)+ \u21d2 B ( n +1)+ \u2013O \u2212 \u2013B ( n +1)+ \u21d2 B ( n +1)+ \u2013O 2\u2212 \u2013B n + The overlap of the oxygen 2p orbital with the transition metal 3d orbital results in electron conduction. Due to the constant valence state of Sc 3+ , it is impossible for electronic conduction through the overlapping of 2p orbital of cobalt ion (2+, 3+, 4+) with the 3d orbital of Sc 3+ . Therefore, Sc 3+ would act as a block for electron conduction in perovskite. This explains the decrease in the electrical conductivity with the increase of Sc 3+ doping level at >5 mol% ( x \u2265 0.05, SrCo 1\u2212 x Sc x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ). However, the electrical conductivity was also closely related with the phase structure of the material. The increase of the electrical conductivity with the increase of Sc 3+ doping concentration at \u22645 mol% ( x \u2264 0.05) could be explained by the effective stabilization of the high electrical conductive cubic phase. The cubic phase, having 180\u00b0 of overlapping, maximizes the electronic conduction. 3.3 Cathode performance Based on above XRD and electrical conductivity results, the optimized Sc 3+ doping level should be around 5\u201310 mol%. At such a doping level, a balance between high electrical conductivity and phase stability should be reached. The performance of the SrCo 1\u2212 x Sc x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 with x = 0.05 and 0.1 as cathode materials for IT-SOFCs was then investigated by the symmetric cell method with SDC as the electrolyte. Fig. 5 is the typical impedance spectra for SrSc 0.05 Co 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 electrodes tested under air at various temperatures. An area specific resistance (ASR) of only \u223c0.25, 0.105 and 0.053 \u03a9cm 2 for SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 was observed at 600, 650 and 700 \u00b0C, respectively. Pure Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) is one of the most promising and well investigated cathode materials IT-SOFCs. The electrode area specific resistance around 2.5 \u03a9cm 2 was reached with the similar doped ceria electrolyte. As compared to the reported value of SSC, SrSc 1\u2212 x Co x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 composite oxides displayed a better cathode performance. It strongly suggests the promising application of SrSc 1\u2212 x Co x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 composite oxides in IT-SOFCs. Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the temperature dependence of area specific resistance for doped ( x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1) and un-doped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 . For both cases, the calcination temperature of 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h and an electrode thickness of \u223c20 \u03bcm was applied. As compared to the undoped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , the cathode performance improved several times of the samples with x = 0.05 and 0.1. The derived activation energy for undoped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , SrSc 0.05 Co 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 is 154, 126 and 106 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the Sc 3+ doping led to a decrease not only in cathode area specific resistance, but also in the activation energy for oxygen activation. Although SrSc 0.05 Co 0.95 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 displayed a slightly better performance than SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 at high temperatures, a lower ASR was observed for SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 at temperatures lower than 700 \u00b0C due to its lower activation energy. Compared to BSCF, it has the advantages of higher electrical conductivity (160 S cm \u22121 versus 50 S cm \u22121 , at 600 \u00b0C) and lower thermal expansion coefficient. The measured thermal expansion coefficient for BSCF and SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 was 25 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 20 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 , respectively. The lowering in thermal expansion makes it more compatible with the SDC electrolyte. Fig. 7 illustrates the TGA data of SCF, BSCF and SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 under air atmosphere. SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 demonstrates a smaller lattice oxygen release than BSCF or SCF. For the mixed conducting oxides, the thermal expansion coefficient was contributed from two aspects, the thermal excited expansion and the chemical induced expansion due to the oxygen release [22] . The reduced thermal expansion for SrSc 0.1 Co 0.9 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 than SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 was then attributed to the decrease in the chemical induced thermal expansion. 4 Conclusions A minor concentration of Sc 3+ doping into the B-site of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , i.e., the formation of SrSc 1\u2212 x Co x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 composite, can effectively stabilize the cubic phase structure of the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide. The optimized doping level was found to be within 5\u201310 mol% ( x = 0.05\u20130.1), which resulted in not only the considerable stabilization of the cubic phase, but also the substantial increase of the electrical conductivity. The derived SrSc 1\u2212 x Co x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 was found to be a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells because of its lower area specific resistance.

        "abstract": "This study characterizes BaCo 0.7Fe 0.2Nb 0.1O 3-\u03b4 (BCFN) perovskite oxide and evaluates it as a potential cathode material for proton-conducting SOFCs with a BaZr 0.1Ce 0.7Y 0.2O 3-\u03b4 (BZCY) electrolyte. A four-probe DC conductivity measurement demonstrated that BCFN has a modest electrical conductivity of 2-15 S cm -1 in air with p-type semiconducting behavior. An electrical conductivity relaxation test showed that BCFN has higher D chem and K chem than the well-known Ba 0.5Sr 0.5Co 0.8Fe 0.2O 3-\u03b4 oxide. In addition, it has relatively low thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) with values of 18.2 \u00d7 10 -6 K -1 and 14.4 \u00d7 10 -6 K -1 at temperature ranges of 30-900 \u00b0C and 30-500 \u00b0C, respectively. The phase reaction between BCFN and BZCY was investigated using powder and pellet reactions. EDX and XRD characterizations demonstrated that BCFN had lower reactivity with the BZCY electrolyte than strontium-containing perovskite oxides such as SrCo 0.9Nb 0.1O 3-\u03b4 and Ba 0.6Sr 0.4Co 0.9Nb 0.1O 3-\u03b4. The impedance of BCFN was oxygen partial pressure dependent. Introducing water into the cathode atmosphere reduced the size of both the high-frequency and low-frequency arcs of the impedance spectra due to facilitated proton hopping. The cathode polarization resistance and overpotential at a current density of 100 mA cm -2 were 0.85 \u03a9 cm -2 and 110 mV in dry air, which decreased to 0.43 \u03a9 cm -2 and 52 mV, respectively, in wet air (\u223c3% H 2O) at 650 \u00b0C. A decrease in impedance was also observed with polarization time; this was possibly caused by polarization-induced microstructure optimization. A promising peak power density of \u223c585 mW cm -2 was demonstrated by an anode-supported cell with a BCFN cathode at 700 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "To develop high-power and fast energy storage devices, electrode materials with superior ionic and electronic transport properties should be developed. Herein, a novel composite electrode with TiO2 nanotubes connected onto a conductive carbon nanofiber network is designed and realized through a general route. The carbon matrix is first synthesized using an electrospinning technique and heat-treatment, and the embedded rutile TiO2 nanoparticles are formed in situ as the starting materials for the hydrothermal reaction. After hydrothermal treatment, a three-dimensional (3D) porous architecture is developed. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the raw embedded rutile TiO2 nanoparticles react with NaOH solution and go out around the carbon nanofiber matrix to form a well-connected 3D porous nanotube/nanofiber architecture. By using the as-prepared films as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) without the application of any additional conductive agent or binder, high initial capacity and excellent rate performance (214 mA h g-1 at 5 C rate, 180 mA h g-1 at 10 C rate, 138 mA h g-1 at 20 C rate and 112 mA h g-1 at 30 C rate) are achieved. Moreover, the electrode shows stable cycling performance, especially at a high rate of 30 C, without undergoing decay after 1000 cycles. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "Increasing energy demands have stimulated intense research activities on reversible electrochemical conversion and storage systems with high efficiency, low cost, and environmental benignity. It is highly challenging but desirable to develop efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A universal and facile method for the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding electrocatalytic activity for both the ORR and OER in alkaline medium is reported. A mixture of Pt/C catalyst with superior ORR activity and a perovskite oxide based catalyst with outstanding OER activity was employed in appropriate ratios, and prepared by simple ultrasonic mixing. Nanosized platinum particles with a wide range of platinum to oxide mass ratios was realized easily in this way. The as-formed Pt/C-oxide composites showed better ORR activity than a single Pt/C catalyst and better OER activity than a single oxide to bring about much improved bifunctionality (\u0394E is only \u22480.8\u2005V for Pt/C-BSCF; BSCF=Ba0.5 Sr0.5 Co0.8 Fe0.2 O3-\u03b4 ), due to the synergistic effect. The electronic transfer mechanism and the rate-determining step and spillover mechanism were two possible origins of such a synergistic effect. Additionally, the phenomenon was found to be universal, although the best performance could be reached at different platinum to oxide mass ratios for different oxide catalysts. This work thus provides an innovative strategy for the development of new bifunctional electrocatalysts with wide application potentials in high-energy and efficient electrochemical energy storage and conversion.",

Stable YSZ and SDC inks with solids contents as high as 20 and 10 wt.%, respectively, were first prepared. One single printing typically resulted in an YSZ membrane with thickness of approximately 1.5 \u03bcm, and membranes with thicknesses varied from 1.5 to 7.5 \u03bcm were fabricated with multiple sequential printing. An as-fabricated cell with a La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) cathode delivered a peak power density (PPD) of 860 mW cm-2 at 800 C. The SDC layer prepared using the inkjet printing method exhibited enclosed pores and a rough surface, which was, however, ideal for its application as a buffering layer. A cell with a dense 7.5-\u03bcm-thick YSZ layer, a 2-\u03bcm-thick SDC buffering layer and a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O 3-\u03b4 (BSCF) cathode was fabricated; this cell delivered a PPD of 1040 mW cm-2 at 750 C and a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of approximately 1.10 V.

        "abstract": "Perovskite Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) is a promising mixed conducting ceramic membrane material for air separation. In this work, BSCF powder was synthesized by a modified Pechini sol\u2013gel technique at relatively lower temperature. The O 2 permeation through a series of BSCF membranes has been tested at different temperatures and various O 2 partial pressure gradients. Theoretical investigation indicated that bulk diffusion and the O 2 exchange reactions on membrane surfaces jointly controlled the O 2 permeation through BSCF membranes with thickness of between 1.1 and 0.75 mm. To further improve the O 2 fluxes, effective efforts are made on membrane thickness reduction and surface modification by spraying porous BSCF layers on both surfaces. When the membrane thickness was reduced from 0.75 to 0.40 mm, the O 2 fluxes were increased by 20\u201360% depending on the operating conditions. The surface modification further improved the O 2 flux by another 20\u201340%. The high O 2 fluxes achieved in this work are quite encouraging with a maximum value reaching 6.0 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 at 900 \u00b0C. Keywords D. Perovskites Oxygen permeation Mixed conduction Surface modification 1 Introduction Global climate change is connected with the rising atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide from fossil energy use. The production of electricity with no carbon emissions to the atmosphere will become the essential elements of the future power infrastructure transformation. Oxygen production by air separation is of great importance, as most large scale clean coal energy technologies require oxygen as feed gas [1] . For example, if pure oxygen instead of air is used in power plants, the major constituent of the waste gas produced during the combustion process would be CO 2 , which can be readily and economically captured for geological storage. Current tonnage O 2 production is based on cryogenic distillation, a 100-year-old technology, which is expensive and energy intensive because it operates at very low temperature and at elevated pressures. Coupling a cryogenic air separation unit at the front end of a coal gasifier or oxyfuel power plant is unpractical because of its lower power generation efficiencies. Dense mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramic membranes can continuously deliver 100% pure O 2 under O 2 concentration gradient without the requirement of external electrical loadings, offering the potential to tackle these energy penalties and improve the viability of CO 2 zero emission technology [2\u20136] . In addition, these MIEC membranes are also of interest as membrane reactors for these high temperature oxidative processes (i.e., gas partial oxidation) to improve the product yield/selectivity beyond what the reaction equilibrium allows [7\u20139] . From an application point of view, membranes must possess sufficiently high oxygen permeability and good structural stability to withstand real process conditions (i.e., low O 2 concentration, light hydrocarbon reducing environment, presence of CO 2 and H 2 O vapor). To address these problems, Teraoka et al. developed high oxygen permeation flux membranes from SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 perovskite [10] . The high permeation flux was attributed to the high concentration of oxygen vacancy in the lattice due to the total substitution of La 3+ metal ion by Sr 2+ in the A-site of perovskite. Although this material lacks of sufficient chemical and structural stability in practical operation conditions, their breakthrough work inspired the research community to explore new perovskite membranes with improved phase stability and oxygen permeability by optimizing the metal oxide composition in ABO 3 perovskite structure [4,11\u201320] . One example is the composition of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF), developed from SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 by partial substitution of Sr with Ba which possesses a larger ionic radius [4] . It has been found that the BSCF perovskits exhibit not only the highest oxygen permeation flux among these mixed conducting ceramics, but also enhance the phase stability at high temperatures. Most of previous studies in this area were focused on material synthesis, composition optimization, characterization, stability test and the exploration of oxygen permeation mechanism. In this work, we investigated the oxygen permeation behavior through thicker BSCF plate membranes and provided the proof of concept of the effective ways to further improve the oxygen fluxes by reducing membrane thickness and surface modification. We used the modified Pechini sol\u2013gel technique to prepare the BSCF powder with pure perovskite phase as the starting membrane material. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid were used jointly as chelating ligands to bind the metal ions and form a stable complexing solution. 2 Experimental 2.1 BSCF membrane synthesis Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 powders investigated in this study were synthesized through a sol\u2013gel process based on an EDTA-citrate complexing method. Appropriate amounts of Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (analytical grades) were used as the raw materials for metal sources. Details of the synthesis procedure have been described elsewhere [21] . The disk-shaped membranes to be used in the oxygen permeation tests were prepared by uni-axial pressing method. Weighed amount of BSCF powder was pressed using a 15 mm stainless steel die under a pressure of 280 MPa. Then the green disks were sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h in air at a heating/cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The sintered membranes have a diameter of 14 mm and were polished to the different thickness ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 mm. The relative density of membranes was measured by the Archimedes method. For surface modification, the porous BSCF layer was spray-deposited on the sintered membrane surface. The BSCF slurry used for spraying was prepared by mixing 5 g BSCF powder, 47 mL isopropanol, 10 mL glycol and 3 mL glycerol. After ball-milling for 1 h in a High Energy Ball Miller, the slurry was spay-deposited on both sides of the membrane surfaces. Then the surface modified membranes were dried at 150 \u00b0C for 1 h and then calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air with a heating/cooling rate of 2 \u00b0C min \u22121 to burn out the organic materials and generate the porous BSCF layer on both sides of the membrane surfaces. 2.2 Membrane characterization and oxygen permeation test The crystal structure of the synthesized powders was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The morphological and compositional features of the prepared membranes were examined using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The oxygen permeation fluxes of the membranes were measured with a gas chromatography method. Membranes were sealed with a silver paste onto the quartz support tubes. The sidewall of the membrane disks was also covered with the sealant to avoid leakage and radial contribution to the oxygen flux. Ambient air was used as the feed gas (oxygen rich-side atmosphere) and helium with various flow rates as the sweep gas (oxygen lean side atmosphere). A gas chromatograph (CP 3800, Varian) equipped with a 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve capillary column was used to in-situ analyze the composition of the outlet gas. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 BSCF membrane synthesis With the condensing process by water evaporation, a deep-purple transparent gel was obtained. Because no precipitation occurred over the entire condensation process, the compositional homogeneity of metal ion distribution on the atomic level in the aqueous solution could be well maintained in the resulting gels. This gel was transformed into the BSCF precursor powder by heating the gel at 250 \u00b0C for 24 h. BSCF perovskite with desired structure was obtained by heating the precursor powder at high temperatures. The crystalline phase development as a function of calcining temperature is depicted by the XRD patterns plotted in Fig. 1 . The sample calcined at the temperature of 500 \u00b0C is the mixture of metal oxides, carbonates and other unidentified intermediate phases. At 800 \u00b0C or above, the XRD spectra exhibit the patterns having seven strong diffraction peaks with respective 2 \u03b8 angles and lattice planes of 22.28 {1 0 0}, 31.72 {1 1 0}, 39.24 {1 1 1}, 45.52 {2 0 0}, 56.60 {2 1 1}, 66.36 {2 2 0}, and 75.72 {3 1 0}, which have previously been related to the cubic perovskite phase of BSCF as shown in Fig. 1 (b\u2013d) [4] . In this work, the BSCF powder used as the starting membrane material was prepared at 900 \u00b0C. By contrast, a sintering temperature of 1150 \u00b0C and a processing time of 10 h are required by the conventional solid-state reaction method for the same purpose. The present research shows a substantial decrease of the processing time and temperature required for the formation of the desired single-phase perovskite structure. Using the prepared perovskite powder as the starting membrane material, most of the sintered membranes are gas tight and have the relative density larger than 95% tested by the Archimedes method. 3.2 O 2 permeation through BSCF plate membranes with thickness of 1.1 and 0.75 mm O 2 permeation through two BSCF membranes with thickness of 1.1 (Membr-I) and 0.75 mm (Membr-II) was tested by introducing air flow as feed gas and He as sweep gas separately in the two sides of the membranes. At high temperatures, oxygen will permeate from the air side to the permeate side having sweep gas because of the oxygen concentration gradient across the membrane. At the He sweep gas flow rate of 100 mL min \u22121 , the effect of temperature on O 2 permeation flux was investigated from 550 to 900 \u00b0C. At temperatures below 600 \u00b0C, the O 2 fluxes were very small and appreciable high oxygen permeation can only occur at temperatures above 700 \u00b0C. Fig. 2 a shows that the operating temperature dependency on O 2 fluxes through two samples is in almost linear trend. The improvement of O 2 fluxes with temperature is due to the enhancement of oxygen diffusion and surface reaction rate at high temperatures. For example, the oxygen fluxes through Membrane-I was increased by 1.41 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 from 1.65 (750 \u00b0C) to 3.06 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 (900 \u00b0C) and through Membrane-II by 1.54 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 from 1.93 (750 \u00b0C) to 3.47 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 (900 \u00b0C). Fig. 2 b shows Arrhenius plots of oxygen permeation through the two membranes. Activation energies for oxygen transport through Membranes-I and -II under the conditions of Fig. 2 a are 43.5 and 41.2 kJ/mol, respectively. O 2 flux through dense mixed ionic and electronic perovskite membranes are essentially controlled by two factors: the rate of oxygen diffusion through the bulk of membrane and the two surface reactions for oxygen exchange. Under the bulk diffusion controlling step, the oxygen permeation flux through a membrane exposed to a chemical potential gradient can be generally described by Wagner's equation, (1) J O 2 = \u2212 R T 4 2 F 2 L \u222b ln P \u2032 O 2 ln P \u2033 O 2 \u03c3 ion \u03c3 el \u03c3 ion + \u03c3 el d [ ln P O 2 ] where \u03c3 ion , \u03c3 el , F, L, P \u2032 O 2 and P \u2033 O 2 stand for the oxygen ionic conductivity, electronic conductivity, the Faraday constant, the membrane thickness, the oxygen rich-side and oxygen lean-side partial pressure, respectively. Eq. (1) illustrates that the permeation flux is also influenced by the material property (oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity). In our previous work, the maximum electronic conductivities of BSCF under air atmosphere can reach around 40 S cm \u22121 , while the oxygen ionic conductivity of BSCF is only about 1.4 S cm \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C [22,23] . With the overwhelming electronic conductivity over oxygen ionic one in BSCF, Eq. (1) can be simplified as (2) J o 2 = \u2212 R T 4 2 F 2 L \u222b ln P \u2032 O 2 ln P \u2033 O 2 \u03c3 ion d [ ln \u2009 P o 2 ] The relationship of \u03c3 ion and oxygen partial pressure can be expressed by the empirical equation of (3) \u03c3 ion = \u03c3 ion O P O 2 n Combining (2) and (3) gives (4) J O 2 = \u03b2 L [ P \u2033 O 2 n \u2212 P \u2032 O 2 n ] = a [ P \u2033 O 2 n \u2212 P \u2032 O 2 n ] Where \u03b2 = \u2212 \u03c3 ion O R T 4 2 F 2 n On the other hand, according to the theoretical work by Xu and Thomson [24] , when the membrane thickness is far less than the critical thickness, the O 2 permeation is mainly determined by the surface-exchange kinetics. The following equation can be derived for O 2 permeation fluxes: (5) J O 2 = k r ( P \u2032 O 2 0.5 \u2212 P \u2033 O 2 0.5 ) ( P \u2032 O 2 0.5 + P \u2033 O 2 0.5 ) Where k r is the surface exchange rate constant. From the value of n in Eq. (4) , the rate limiting step of the O 2 permeation can be roughly identified. For n < 0, bulk diffusion of the oxygen ion is the rate-limiting step, while for n \u2265 0.5, the reaction of molecular oxygen with the membrane surfaces is the rate-controlling step. For 0 < n < 0.5, the oxygen permeation is jointly controlled by both surface reactions and bulk diffusion. Fig. 3 displays the effects of oxygen partial pressure in the permeate side on O 2 permeation at 900 \u00b0C. As can be seen, decrease in O 2 partial pressure by increasing sweep gas rates resulted in higher oxygen fluxes. For instance, increasing the He flow rate from 20 to 260 mL min \u22121 lowered the O 2 partial pressure from 0.031 to 0.0058 atm and improved the O 2 fluxes through Membr-I from 2.33 to 3.52 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 . Eq. (4) can be used to describe the oxygen permeation behavior through two thicker BSCF membranes at the investigated temperature range. For comparison purpose, two typical theoretical results from Eq. (4) by regression analysis based on the Least Squares were also presented as the solid lines in Fig. 3 . The modeling results fit very well with the experimental data for two membrane samples examined. The observation of positive values of 0.33 and 0.12 indicates that both processes of bulk diffusion and surface reactions jointly influenced the O 2 permeation process. In this case, to further improve the O 2 fluxes through the BSCF membranes, efforts should be placed on the membrane thickness reduction and surface modification. 3.3 Oxygen permeation through BSCF membrane with reduced thickness (0.4 mm) and surface modification Membr-III with thickness of 0.4 mm was prepared with similar surface morphologies as these of Membr-I and II. Membr-III exhibited much improved performance in terms of permeation rate. Fig. 4 shows the P \u2033 O 2 dependence of oxygen permeation fluxes. Compared to Membr-II, Membr-III further improved the oxygen flux by 20 to 60% depending on the operating temperatures. For example, at 800 \u00b0C and He gas rate of 100 mL min \u22121 , the oxygen fluxes through Membr-II with thickness of 0.75 mm was 2.43 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 ; at similar conditions, the O 2 flux through Membr-III were improved by 38% and reached 3.35 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 . To give another example as shown in Fig. 4 b, at 900 \u00b0C and similar O 2 partial pressure in the permeate side ( P \u2033 O 2 ) of 0.02 atm, Membr-III gave O 2 flux of 5.1 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 in contrast to the lower value of 3.2 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 by Membr-II. The better performance of Membr-III is closely related to its thinner thickness which provides less mass transport resistance for oxygen ion diffusion. The thickness of plate membrane is often much larger than the critical thickness at which the oxygen permeation is equally determined by the surface-exchange kinetics and bulk-diffusion. In this case, to maximize the oxygen flux, BSCF membranes should be prepared as thin as possible. However, under our laboratory conditions, BSCF plate with 0.4 mm thickness was the thinnest membrane which can be prepared by pressing method. For the fabrication of ultra-thin BSCF plate membranes, coating technology has to be employed. As discussed above, when the BSCF membrane thickness is less than 1.1 mm, the surface reactions between molecular oxygen, lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies and electron-holes already play an import role in the determination of oxygen permeation rate. Therefore, membrane surface modification to promote the reaction kinetics will also be effective to increase the oxygen permeation rate. Surface modification can be achieved by coating a more porous layer with higher surface area or by deposition of catalyst of superior O 2 exchanging properties. In this work, Membr-III was further coated with porous layer of the same BSCF material. This avoids the unfavorable reaction between the two different materials employed or the peeling off of the porous layer due to the mismatch of different thermal expansion. Fig. 5 shows the SEM pictures of Membr-III and its modified BSCF membrane (Sample IV) surface and cross-sectional views. Fig. 5 a shows the polished surface of Membr-III is quite smooth and the grain boundary of BSCF particles cannot be distinguished. It should be noted that the membranes are not 100% densified and there are still many isolated pores along the cross section area; however, there is no connected porosity across the membranes. After spray coating, the porous BSCF layer with thickness of 15 \u03bcm, consisting of agglomerated 3 \u03bcm-sized particles, integrates well to the original membrane surface as shown in Fig. 5 b (marked with blue rectangles). The effect of surface modification on oxygen permeation was further investigated as depicted in Fig. 6 . Compared to the original membrane (Membr-III) with similar densified thickness of 0.4 mm, the performance of the membrane after the deposition of porous layer (Membr-IV) in oxygen permeation was improved by 20 to 40% with relatively larger improvement at lower temperatures. For instance, at 700 and 900 \u00b0C, the O 2 permeation fluxes were increased from 1.68 to 2.35 and 5.0 to 6.0 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 , respectively. Such significant improvement on oxygen permeation flux of BSCF is due to the surface modification with porous layer which enlarges the surface area for oxygen exchange reaction. So far, a series of perovskite oxides with a general stoichiometric formula of A y A \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 y ) B x B \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 x ) O ( 3 \u2212 \u03b1 ) have been reported to possess appreciably high oxygen permeation rate [4,10\u201320] . The A , A \u2032, B and B \u2032 elements can be selected from La, Sr, Ba, Ca, Zr, Mg, Al, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ga, Zr, or Z and x / y is ranged from 0\u20131. Among the mixed conducting plate membranes tested in the literature, the O 2 fluxes achieved in the present work are the highest. For BSCF hollow fibre membranes with a thickness of 0.25 mm, Liu and Gavalas reported a maximum oxygen flux of 2.8 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 at 900 \u00b0C [25] . The fluxes measured in the current study was up to 6.0 ml min \u22121 cm \u22122 with membrane thickness of 0.4 mm and surface modification. The contamination by sulfur during the preparation is one of possible reasons for the lower permeation rates of these BSCF hollow fibres [25] . It has been suggested that when the permeation flux through a mixed conducting ceramic membrane is larger than 10 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 [STP] (7.44 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 ) [26,27] , the membrane can be considered for large-scale application to replace the traditional cryogenic method which is energy-intensive and cannot be economically applied for clean energy deliveries. According to the theoretical prediction in Fig. 3 b, when the O 2 pressure in the permeate side is less than 10 \u22125 atm (i.e., by applying vacuum), the O 2 flux through Membr-III with 0.4 mm-thickness will reach 9.0 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 . Based on the result of surface modification, the O 2 flux through Membr-IV operated at this condition can be up to 11 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 approaching the target of commercial interest. 4 Conclusion High quality BSCF powder to be used as membrane material with pure perovskite phase was prepared via a modified Pechini sol\u2013gel technique. O 2 permeation was experimentally and theoretically investigated based on a series of BSCF plate membranes. Theoretical analysis implied that oxygen permeation was jointly controlled by surface modification and bulk diffusion when the BSCF membrane thickness was less than or equal to 1.1 mm. Reducing membrane thickness to 0.45 mm improved the fluxes by 20\u201360% compared to the membrane of 0.75 mm thickness. Membrane modification was achieved by spraying a porous BSCF layer on both surfaces with thickness of 15 \u03bc. O 2 fluxes through the surface modified membrane were further improved by 20\u201340% depending on the operating conditions. The maximum flux achieved in this work reached 6.0 mL min \u22121 cm \u22122 at 900 \u00b0C, which is the highest value among all the plate membrane reported in the literature. The encouraging permeation value together with the good operational stability reported in previous work makes the Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 material interesting as a mixed conducting ceramic membrane for large-scale applications.

        "title": "Fabrication and evolution of catalyst-coated membranes by direct spray deposition of catalyst ink onto Nafion membrane at high temperature",
        "abstract": "An improved fabrication technique for catalyst-coated membrane (CCM), characterized by high-temperature spray deposition and immobilization of the membrane with a pyrex glass via Van der Walt force, was developed. The high heating temperature minimized the adsorption of liquid ethanol by the Nafion membrane and also resulted in the firm adhesion of the membrane to the pyrex glass, both processes suppressed the dimensional change of the membrane during the fabrication. The as-fabricated CCMs were analyzed by I\u2013V polarization, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A comparative study was also made with the conventional hot-pressed membrane-electrode assembly with identical Pt catalyst loading of 0.4 mg cm \u22122 . Higher catalyst utilization and better cell performance were observed for the cell based on the CCM configuration. A peak power density of \u223c715 mW cm \u22122 was achieved when oxygen was the cathode atmosphere and hydrogen was the fuel at ambient pressure. Keywords Catalyst-coated membranes Polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell Spray deposition 1 Introduction Polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have received considerable attention recently as a potential power source for portable, mobile, and stationary applications because of their numerous inherent advantages [1,2] . Membrane\u2013electrode assemblies (MEAs) are the key component of PEMFCs. Nowadays, many techniques have been exploited to fabricate MEAs, in which, the electro-catalyst could be coated either onto a gas diffusion layer (GDL-based MEAs), or directly onto an electrolyte membrane (CCM-based MEAs) [3,4] . The CCM method makes a good contact between the catalyst layer and the electrolyte membrane, which can effectively reduce the catalyst loading without sacrificing the cell performance [5] . Among the numerous fabrication techniques of CCMs, the direct wet-spray deposition of catalyst ink onto electrolyte membrane is simple and easy to scale-up. However, one technical challenge is that Nafion membrane has the high tendency to swell or wrinkle when contacting with many solvents [6] . To minimize such dimensional change during the catalyst deposition, researchers have tried to pre-saturate the membrane with a liquid of high boiling point, such as glycerol [7] . We also have tried glycerol as the adsorbent with some success [8] . However, such high boiling-point solvents are not easily to be evaporated. It could remain in the MEAs by covering the active sites and function as a poison to the electro-catalyst [9] . In this work, CCMs have been prepared by an improved direct spray method by deposition of catalyst suspension on an immobilized Nafion membrane at high temperature. Electrochemical characterizations of the cells have been conducted. A comparative study with a cell composed of a traditional GDL-based MEA was also presented. 2 Experimental The catalyst ink was prepared by ball milling commercial 40 wt.% Pt supported on carbon black with 5 wt.% Nafion solution in H + form at the weight ratio of 7:3 [8] in ethanol media for about 10 min. The catalyst was first wetted with a small amount of de-ionized water to prevent any catalyst burning. CCM-based MEAs were fabricated by direct spray deposition of the catalyst ink onto Nafion 212 membrane, which were firstly bonded on a flat pyrex glass by adhesive tape. The deposition was conducted at 110\u2013150 \u00b0C with the help of a hot-plate. The spray velocity was controlled about 0.3 ml min \u22121 with the spray angle of about 45\u00b0. The spray was made in zig-zag type. It typically took 10 min to finish the deposition of one surface of a 4 \u00d7 4 cm 2 membrane. For GDL-based MEA, the prepared catalyst ink was spray deposited onto a telfon-impregnated carbon paper to form GDL-supported electrodes, which were then placed at both sides of a Nafion 212 membrane and hot pressed. The hot pressing was conducted at 140 \u00b0C and under a load of 200 kg cm \u22122 for 90 s. Single cells were assembled from the prepared MEAs, teflon gaskets and graphite blocks with a serpentine flow field. I\u2013V characterization of the fuel cell was conducted with the help of an electrical loading at potentiostat mode, conducted at a cell temperature of 70 \u00b0C. The hydrogen was humidified by passing through a water bottom at 75 \u00b0C before introducing into the fuel cell anode chamber. The surface morphologies of the CCM were characterized by an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM, QUATA-2000). Cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted using an advanced electrochemical system model PARSTAT 2273 from Princeton Applied Research. During the CV test, hydrogen at 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was fed to the anode chamber while the cathode was swept with pure nitrogen at 100 ml min \u22121 [STP].The scanning was made between 0.0 and 1.4 V at 50 mV s \u22121 scan rate. For the EIS characterization, hydrogen at the flow rate of 200 ml min \u22121 [STP] was introduced to the anode chamber and pure oxygen to the cathode at 200 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The test was made at a cell voltage of 0.85 V. The impedance spectra were recorded in the 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz frequency range with a sinusoidal amplitude of 10 mV. 3 Results and discussion Ethanol is frequently applied as the liquid vehicle for spray deposition However, it was found that Nafion membrane swelled seriously when contacting with liquid ethanol. The area expansion of the membrane reached 22.5, 30, 44.4, and 100% after saturated with liquid ethanol, respectively, at a temperature of 25, 30, 40, and 78 \u00b0C, suggesting a lower temperature is beneficial for a smaller dimensional change of the membrane when the ethanol is in liquid state. The CCM fabrication was first conducted at room temperature. As shown in Fig.\u00a01 a is the surface morphology of the as-fabricated CCM by applying ethanol as the liquid media. Cracks were observed throughout the electro-catalyst layers. Similar observations were also reported over the electro-catalyst surface of CCM or catalyst-coated GDL prepared by traditional low-temperature fabrication methods [10,11] . With the presence of cracks, the cell performance and durability may be affected greatly. Firstly, cracks provide suitable areas to hold pools of water, and thus increase the swelling of electrode. Secondly, the gradual loss of catalyst becomes a serious concern since the mechanical strength between catalyst and electrode is usually weak around the crack areas. In order to increase the integrity of the CCM, it is crucial to reduce the swelling/wrinkling of the Nafion membrane during the spray deposition process. Since dimensional change of the membrane was caused mainly by liquid ethanol, one effective way to suppress such dimensional change may make the ethanol gasified before being adsorbed by the Nafion membrane. A higher temperature than boiling point of ethanol was then exploited during spray deposition of the catalyst. The membrane was first heated up to a temperature of 110, 130 or 150 \u00b0C by a hot plate at a constant power output. As shown in Fig.\u00a02 , the surface temperature of the Nafion membrane was measured by an IR thermometer during the spray deposition process. Since the gasification of ethanol is endothermic in nature, the surface temperature of Nafion membrane dropped to \u223c60, \u223c78 and 80 \u00b0C during the spray deposition at the heating temperature of 110, 130 and 150 \u00b0C (the hot plate), respectively. It suggests large amount of ethanol in the sprayed catalyst ink might still be in liquid state when it reached the Nafion membrane at the heating temperature of 110 \u00b0C. However, most of the ethanol was evaporated before reaching the Nafion membrane at a heating temperature of 150 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig.\u00a01 b is surface morphologies of a CCM fabricated at 150 \u00b0C. As a whole, it is flat in shape without any surface crack. However, some local distortion was observed, which might be related with the local swelling/wrinkling of the membrane during the spray deposition. To minimize such local distortion, the Nafion membrane was attached to a pyrex glass by applying liquid ethanol as a paste with four edges of the membrane fixed with a high-temperature adhesive tape. After the evaporation of ethanol by slow heating, the membrane adhered to the pyrex glass firmly due to the Van der Walt force. During the spray deposition, the Nafion membrane was still adhered to the pyrex glass firmly, suggesting no liquid ethanol reached the interface between the Nafion membrane and the pyrex glass. The interaction between Nafion membrane and the pyrex glass then effectively suppressed the local dimensional change of the membrane during the spray deposition. As shown in Fig.\u00a01 c, the catalyst layer connected with the electrolyte membrane surface pretty well without any delimitation even after the water boiling. Fig.\u00a03 shows the current density\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) and current density\u2013power density curves (I\u2013P) of the single cells with the CCMs prepared by the direct high-temperature deposition technique at room temperature or elevated temperature of 110, 130 and 150 \u00b0C. The pyrex glass was applied for fixing the Nafion membrane during the high-temperature spray deposition. For all CCMs, the catalyst loadings were fixed at 0.4 mg cm \u22122 (0.2 mg cm \u22122 for each electrode) and the hydrogen and oxygen flows were controlled at 200 ml min \u22121 . It clearly shows that the cell performance increased with the increase of heating temperature during the cell fabrication. For example, the peak power density is 550, 650 and 715 mW cm \u22122 , respectively, for the CCM prepared at room temperature, 110, 130 and 150 \u00b0C. The result shows it is importance to spray catalyst ink onto Nafion membrane at a high temperature. The performance for the cell prepared at 150 \u00b0C was comparable to the literature results for a similar CCM prepared by a decal transfer method [12] . For which, to avoid the dimensional change of the membrane during the wet spray, the catalyst ink was first sprayed onto a PTFE thin film, and then the catalyst was transferred onto the membrane by hot-pressed together with the Nafion membrane. However, decal transfer method increases the complexity of the preparation process and becomes more difficult for scale-up. As comparison, the direct spray process is inherently much simplifier. It is believed that the direct deposition of catalyst onto membrane has better catalyst utilization than that via the GDL-based way. For comparison, GDL-based MEA was also fabricated by spray deposition of the catalyst to GDLs. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 is a comparison of the I\u2013V polarization of the cells prepared based on the CCM method and the GDL method with the identical catalyst ladings of 0.4 mg cm \u22122 . The CCM-based MEA delivered a peak power density of 715 mW cm \u22122 at the cell voltage of 0.45 V. While, the peak power density is \u223c650 mW cm \u22122 for GDL-based MEA. The better performance of the cell with CCM-based MEA was further supported by the impedance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig.\u00a05 a is the cell impedance measured at a cell voltage of 0.85 V responses to the single cells prepared by the two different methods under H 2 /O 2 atmospheres. The lowest sector of the frequency range relates to the impedance of mass diffusion. The polarization resistance of hot-pressed MEA was 8 \u03a9 cm 2 , while it was 6 \u03a9 cm 2 for the hot-sprayed CCM. The reduction in electrode polarization resistance is about 25%. Due to the much faster reaction kinetics of the H 2 oxidation reaction on the Pt/C electrocatalysts as compared to that of the oxygen reduction reaction, the cell impedance reported here is mainly contributed from the cathode oxygen reduction. Therefore, the anode was used as the reference and also as the counter electrode for the AC measurements and the cathode was used as the working electrode. It suggests that the CCM method resulted in an improved cathode performance. The oxygen reduction over the cathode is closely related with the electrolyte\u2013electrode\u2013oxygen triple phase boundary (TPB). It suggests the TPB length was increased via the CCM way. In other words, the catalyst utilization was improved. The catalyst utilization or electrochemical active surface area can be estimated from the peak area of hydrogen oxidation process observed on cyclic voltammograms. A shown in Fig.\u00a05 b is the corresponding CVs of the cell made from CCM and GDL-based MEAs. During the measurement of CV, argon was fed to the working electrode (cathode) and hydrogen was fed to the counter and reference electrode (anode). The electrochemical active surface area estimated from CV could be mainly associated with the cathode catalyst layer. The cyclic voltammetric studies from 0.05 to 0.4 V provides information on the hydrogen adsorption and desorption which occurs over the platinum surface. The region from 0.4 to 0.5 V is regarded as the double-layer region. The peak area under the hydrogen desorption process at 0.2 V versus standard hydrogen electrode is proportional to the electrochemical surface area. As can be seen from Fig.\u00a05 b, the cell made from CCM has larger peak area for the hydrogen desorption process than that of the hot-pressed MEA, suggesting the CCM has higher catalyst utilization than MEA prepared by the conventional hot-pressed method. 4 Conclusions In present work, CCMs were successfully fabricated by direct spray deposition of catalyst ink onto Nafion membranes at high temperature. To suppress the wrinkle and crack of Nafion membrane, it was immobilized on pyrex glass via Van der Valt force. The effect of heating temperature on the cell integrity and performance was studied. By optimizing the fabrication parameters, the catalyst layer adhered to Nafion membrane homogeneously and firmly without any crack formation. The as-fabricated cell with a Pt loading of 0.4 mg cm \u22122 delivered a maximum power density of 715 mW cm \u22122 . We found it was an easy method to fabricate CCM by direct spraying catalyst ink onto Nafion membrane at the temperature of 150 \u00b0C. The CCM exhibited a good performance than the GDL-based MEA due to a good interaction between catalyst layer and electrolyte membrane.

Two different methods of dry milling and wet milling in a liquid alcohol medium were investigated along with three ball milling times (1, 2 and 3h), two different types of starting powders, and three different sintering temperatures (1000, 1050 and 1100\u00b0C). XRD, SEM and oxygen permeation measurements were performed on as-prepared membranes. The experimental results showed that HEBM is an effective way to improve the sintering, microstructure and oxygen permeability of BSCF membranes. By optimizing the HEBM process, the relative density of BSCF membranes improved significantly; as a result, the oxygen permeation flux of BSCF membranes improved by about 20% in comparison to BSCF membranes whose starting powders were not ball milled. Thus, HEBM is a promising way to increase the performance of BSCF membranes for oxygen separation. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Niobium doping effect on phase structure, phase stability and electrical conductivity of SrCoO x oxides and oxygen permeability of the corresponding membranes were systematically investigated. Niobium was successfully incorporated into A-site, B-site or simultaneously A and B double sites of SrCoO x oxide and stabilized the perovskite structure with a cubic symmetry in air down to room temperature at a proper doping amount. However, the A-site doping could not stabilize the cubic structure under a more reducing atmosphere of nitrogen, as to SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , y \u2265 0.1 is necessary to sustain the cubic perovskite structure. Simultaneous doping of Nb at A and B sites is the most effective way to stabilize the perovskite structure under nitrogen atmosphere. Irrespective of doping site, the electrical conductivity decreased monotonously with Nb-doping amount. Both Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 envisaged a decrease in oxygen permeation flux with Nb-doping amount while SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 reached the maximum flux at y = 0.1. Among all the membranes, SrCo 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Nb 0.05 Sr 0.95 Co 0.95 Nb 0.05 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 show the highest oxygen fluxes of 3.5 and 2.7 ml cm \u22122 min \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C under an air/helium gradient, respectively. Keywords Perovskite SrCoO x Niobium Ceramic membrane Oxygen permeation Conductivity 1 Introduction Some oxides such as perovskite-structured SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 showing mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity (MIEC) at elevated temperatures are currently attracting much research interest due to their potential use in air separation and membrane reactors for gas partial oxidations [1\u20139] . These perovskite-type oxides possess electronic conductivity higher than 1000 S cm \u22121 and oxygen ionic conductivity as high as 1 S cm \u22121 [10,11] at elevated temperatures. Such materials are also promising cathode candidates for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells [12\u201314] . Compared to the traditional electrodes with pure electronic conductivity such as lanthanum strontium manganate, MIEC cathode effectively extends reaction sites for oxygen reduction from traditional electrolyte\u2013electrode\u2013air triple phase boundary to the entire cathode surface; therefore, a significant reduction in electrode polarization resistance is resulted [12\u201317] . Up to now, MIEC material development is still focused on these cobalt-based perovskites due to their high oxygen permeation fluxes, high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and good ion diffusion properties [18,19] . Over the last several years, considerable efforts have been put on the further improvement of phase stability and oxygen permeability of cobalt-based oxides (SrCoO x ) via the doping strategy. It is well known that perovskite oxides are highly flexible in material composition and over 90% of atomic elements in the periodic table of elements can be incorporated inside the perovskite structure. Previously we demonstrated that SrCoO x can be stabilized into a cubic perovskite structure (ABO 3 ) when both A and B sites were simultaneously doped with a certain amount of yttrium [20] . The resultant membranes showed higher oxygen permeation fluxes and structural stability. Recently, niobium has been reported to be one of the best B-site dopants for improving the phase structure and oxygen permeability [19,21] . In previous paper, we have systematic investigation of the Nb-doping into A-site of SrCoO x on its phase structure, phase stability, electrical conductivity and the oxygen permeation flux of the corresponding membranes [21] . In this paper, we showed further optimization of the material composition and the development of new SrCoO x based membranes doped by Nb at A-site or double A/B sites. The effects of doping site (A or A and B double sites) and Nb-doping concentration on the phase structure and oxygen permeability of the resulted MIEC membranes were systematically investigated and compared with the previous work of the B-site doped membrane [21] . 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication Nb-doped SrCoO x oxides were synthesized by a solid-phase reaction with SrCO 3 , Nb 2 O 5 and Co 2 O 3 (all in analytical grades) applied as the raw materials for the metal sources. Stoichiometric quantities of SrCO 3 , Nb 2 O 5 and Co 2 O 3 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, purity > 99.9%) had been mixed for 30 min using a FRITSCH Pullerisette 6 high-energy ball miller under acetone liquid media at a rotation speed of 500 RPM. After drying, the mixture was calcined at 1100\u20131200 \u00b0C in air for 10\u201320 h to form the oxides with desired structure. The as-synthesized oxide powders were milled again by high-energy ball to get the qualified uniform powders, which was pressed into a disk-shaped membrane in a stainless steel mold (15 mm in diameter) under a hydraulic pressure of approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 Pa. These green pellets were sintered in an electrical box furnace at 1100\u20131250 \u00b0C for 2\u20135 h in air at a heating/cooling rate of 1\u20132 \u00b0C min \u22121 . 2.2 Basic characterization The crystal structure of the synthesized powders or sintered membranes was characterized by an X-ray diffractormeter (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. To examine the phase stability in a nitrogen atmosphere, the samples were put into a U-type quartz tube and treated at 850 \u00b0C in N 2 for 6 h. After the heat-treatment, the sample was cooled down to room temperature for phase examination. The electrical conductivity was measured by four-probe dc method based on sintered bars of approximate dimensions 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm. The measurements were performed in air upon cooling from 900 to 300 \u00b0C with 5 \u00b0C/step. A constant current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage response on the two voltage wires was recorded using a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to 2 A with the step of 1000 \u03bcm, only the data following the ohmic law were applied for the calculation of the conductivity. 2.3 Oxygen permeation measurement Permeation properties of the membranes were investigated via a gas chromatography (GC) method using a high-temperature oxygen permeation apparatus [20] . A silver paste was used as the sealant to fix the membrane disk onto a dense quartz tube. The effective area for permeation study was around 0.45 cm 2 . The ambient air was used as the feed gas and helium as the sweeping gas to carry the permeated oxygen to a Varian 3800 gas chromatography (GC) equipped with a 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve capillary column for in situ gas composition analysis. The temperatures for oxygen permeation measurement were arranged from 700 to 900 \u00b0C. Depending on the temperature, the measured oxygen concentration in outlet gases from the sweeping gas side was up to 2.6%. However, due to the leakage from the sealing area at high temperatures, nitrogen was also detected with a concentration up to 0.11%. Therefore, the oxygen flux value by mixed conduction was calculated by subtracting the amount of air leakage from the total flux values according to the method reported earlier [2] . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure Shown in Fig. 1 are the X-ray diffraction patterns of A-site (Nb x SrCo 1\u2212 x O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ) and double-site (A and B) Nb-doped SrCoO x oxides with composition of (Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z )(Co 1\u2212 z Nb z )O 3\u2212 \u03b4 where x , and z varies from 0.025 to 0.4. Niobium oxide phase (Nb 2 O 5 ) was not observed in the diffraction patterns suggesting that niobium was successfully incorporated inside the perovskite structure of SrCoO x oxides. It is well known that the pristine parent material SrCoO x demonstrates a 2H hexagonal BaNiO 3 -type structure, a distorted perovskite structure with oxygen vacancy ordered in its lattice resulting from the ionic size mismatch of A- and B-site cations [22] . Because of the immobilized oxygen in SrCoO x lattice, SrCoO x membrane exhibited a very small oxygen permeation flux near zero at temperatures lower than 900 \u00b0C [19,21,22] . A small amount of Nb-doping into one or both of A and B sites ( x , y and z = 0.025) can effectively stabilize the lattice structure of the oxygen vacancy-disordered perovskite with cubic symmetry. Such cubic perovskite structure can be well sustained at Nb-doping concentration up to 0.2 for single site doping (Sr 1\u2212 x Nb x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 or SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ) on A or B and 0.1 for double-site doping (Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ), respectively. At doping concentration higher than these values, one additional diffraction peak with 2 \u03b8 angle around 33\u00b0 started to appear, indicating a phase transition from cubic perovskite to an oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite-related phase structure at room temperature. For joint doping on both cites, when z value is over 0.2 (e.g., 0.4), three crystal phases of brownmillerite structure, cubic perovskite and Co 0.66 Nb 1.33 O 4 [JCPDS 75-2340] co-existed as shown in Fig. 1 b. By the use of yttrium as the dopant, previously we found that SrCoO x cubic perovskite structure can only tolerate single A-cite doping or joint doping on both cites up to concentrations of 10% and 5%, respectively [20] . Doping concentration directly affects the formed oxygen vacancy concentration of the resulted oxides, which further influences the material performance in oxygen separation. Compared to yttrium as the dopant, SrCoO x cubic perovskite can accept niobium dopant with a higher concentration. It was noted that the ionic radii of the dopants have effects on the structural stability of the doped compounds and also on the maximum level that the parent compounds can accept. For doping the ceria electrolyte, the dopant having ionic radius close to size of the ceria could give rise to a lower association enthalpy values with a more stable doping structure [23] . Nb 5+ , Y 3+ and Co 3+ (HS) in six coordination with oxygen ions have an ionic radius of 0.64, 0.9 and 0.61 \u00c5, respectively [24] . Thus, Nb 5+ will have a better match than Y 3+ with Co 3+ because of their relative similar ionic radius in size. This may partially explain the wider doping range limit for Nb 5+ than Y 3+ as a dopant to stabilize the oxygen vacancy-disordered cubic perovskite structure. Fig. 2 shows the magnified parts of the diffraction peaks of Nb-doped SrCoO x on three different circumstances. These peaks with 2 \u03b8 around 33\u00b0 can be indexed as the lattice plane peak of {1 1 0} of the cubic perovskite structure. As can be seen, the peaks were shifted to the lower angles with increasing Nb concentration for the doped samples with the lattice parameters showing in Table 1 . The lattice parameter change implies that unit cell volumes of the resulted perovskite crystal phases are expanding with the increase of Nb concentration at A- or B-site. The cell expansion with Nb-doping amount at the B-site can be explained by the replacement of smaller ionic sized-cobalt ions (Co 3+ and Co 4+ ) with larger sized-Nb 5+ . The increase in unit cell volume of the A-site Nb-doped samples could be attributed to the increased average ionic radius of cobalt ions, regardless the fact that Nb 5+ has a smaller ionic size than Sr 2+ . The entrance of Nb 5+ with a higher valence state than Sr 2+ to the A-site facilitates the cobalt in the B-site to take a lower valence state, thus contributing the unit cell volume increase. For the same Nb-doping level, it is interesting to observe that the unit cell gets the biggest expansion when the Nb is distributed on two sites rather a single site. For example, for the same doping concentration with 5%, the unit cell volumes of Nb 0.05 Sr 0.95 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , SrCo 0.95 Nb 0.05 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Nb 0.025 Sr 0.975 Co 0.975 Nb 0.025 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 are 57.12, 57.42 and 58.12 \u01fa 3 , respectively. This phenomenon is attributable to the joint effects from A and B double-site doping. To be used as a MIEC membrane for oxygen separation, the perovskite membrane must be exposed to asymmetric gas atmosphere conditions with different oxygen partial pressures on both sides. To ensure a stable oxygen permeation flux, the doped membranes have to possess sufficiently high phase stability under very low oxygen partial pressure or reducing atmosphere. It should be noted that these perovskite oxides are generally stable in air or other atmosphere containing a higher oxygen concentration. To examine their structural stability, the crystal phases of the doped SrCoO x samples under nitrogen atmosphere were investigated with results showing in Fig. 3 . For single A-site doping, Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 samples with x values ranged from 0.025 to 0.20 having stable cubic perovskite phases in air exhibit the phase transition to an oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite structure indicating the instability in nitrogen atmosphere. By contrast, the samples of Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 with doping on both A/B cites display better structural stability as no any other phases were observed from their XRD patterns. This also demonstrates that the double-site doping is more effective to improve the stability of the cubic perovskite structure in reducing atmosphere. Similar results were observed from other research work by using Y 3+ as the dopant [20] . 3.2 Electrical conductivity Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity of cubic perovskite-structured Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.025\u20130.2) and Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( z = 0.025\u20130.1) oxides in air. The corresponding data of SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( y = 0.025\u20130.2) can be seen elsewhere [21] . For the three series of materials, a decrease in electrical conductivity with increasing Nb-doping amount was observed. As a whole, all the samples show metal-like conducting behavior at temperature higher than 500 \u00b0C, i.e., a decrease in electrical conductivity with increasing temperature. It is well known that electrical conductivity is closely related to the phase structure and also the compositions and oxidation states of the compositional cations. The electron conduction in perovskite oxide proceeds via electron hopping along B-site cations through strong overlapping B\u2013O\u2013B bonds with a mechanism like the Zerner double exchange process as shown below [25] : B n + O 2 \u2212 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + O \u2212 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + O 2 \u2212 B n + The overlapping of the 2p orbital of the oxygen ion with outer orbital of the transition cations (cobalt ions) results in the electron conduction. The higher degree of overlapping between the outer orbit of B-site ions and 2p orbit of oxygen ion and the easier redox of the B-site metal ions, the easier for the electron hopping, the higher electrical conductivity is expected. As demonstrated previously, the lattice constant increased with Nb-doping content in the A-site of SrCoO x [21] . It suggests the average oxidation state of cobalt ions was decreased with increasing Nb-doping concentration; it then led to a decrease of the electron density of the 3d orbit of cobalt. On the other hand, the increase in lattice constant also decreases the overlapping of cobalt 3d orbital and oxygen 2p orbital. Both factors lead to a decrease of electronic conductivity with increasing Nb-doping concentration at the A-site. Since the oxidation state variation between Nb 4+ and Nb 5+ is much more difficult than that between Co 3+ and Co 4+ , Nb 5+ perhaps acts as a block for electron hopping when it is doped into B-site of SrCoO x . Consequently, the higher Nb 5+ doping concentration the more difficult it is for the electrons to hop. Therefore, this could well explain the decreasing electrical conductivity with increasing Nb 5+ doping concentration at the B-site. As to Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , both effects may have contributed to the decrease in electrical conductivity with Nb-doping content. 3.3 Oxygen permeability The oxides were fabricated into dense ceramic disks by dry pressing using a stainless steel die and sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The sintering density was measured by Archimedes method using water as the liquid media. All the sintered membranes were found to have a density higher than 93%. Microstructure of the ceramic membranes was also observed via SEM. All these membrane displays similar morphology with a typical one showing in Fig. 5 from A and B double-site Nb-doped Nb 0.025 Sr 0.975 Co 0.975 Nb 0.025 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 membranes. As can be seen, at this sintering condition, the grain size can be up to 10 \u03bcm. Gas leakage test at room temperature confirmed that there are no through pinholes inside the ceramic disks. Both faces of the membranes polished by 1000 mesh SiC sand paper down to a uniform membrane thickness of 1.0 mm. The oxygen permeation fluxes of the membranes were measured at various temperatures by applying ambient air as the oxygen rich side atmosphere and a helium flow at 100 ml min \u22121 [STP]. Then it was introduced to another chamber to allow the sweep gas to create a medium level of oxygen gradient across the membrane. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of oxygen permeation fluxes through the various membranes from A-site doping and A and B double-site doping. The permeation information of the membranes from B-site doping can be found in our previous work [21] . For the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 membrane without Nb-doping, a zero permeation flux was observed between 700 and 900 \u00b0C. As can be seen from Fig. 6 , for both series of Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 membranes, the permeation flux increases drastically with minor Nb-doping concentration up to 5%, and then decreases with the further increase of Nb-doping larger than 5%. While for B-site doped SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 membranes, the best Nb-doping concentration for achieving a maximum flux is 10% much larger than that of A-site or A and B double-site doped samples. Under bulk diffusion controlling steps in the cases of most thick disk-shaped membranes, the oxygen permeation flux can be expressed by J O 2 = \u2212 1 4 L V m \u222b ln \u2009 P \u2032 O 2 ln \u2009 P \u2033 O 2 C v D v \u2009 d \u2009 ln [ p O 2 ] At a fixed membrane thickness, temperature and oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane, the oxygen permeation flux is determined by oxygen vacancy concentration ( C v ) and oxygen bulk diffusion coefficient ( D v ) of the membrane, which are closely related with the phase structure of the materials. Cubic perovskite structure is an oxygen vacancy-disordered structure which ensures a high oxygen bulk diffusion rate. This is the reason for Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3 membranes to get a sharply improved oxygen fluxes with the initial lower Nb-doping concentration less than 5% which can stabilize the cubic perovskite structure. On the other hand, 2H hexagonal structure and oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite structure have poor oxygen mobility. As discussed previously, A-site doped samples of Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskites envisaged a decrease in phase stability of the oxygen vacancy-disordered cubic perovskite structure under lower oxygen containing atmosphere. Therefore, the oxygen diffusion in the membrane bulk near the helium sweep side membrane surface was likely suppressed with the introduction of Nb content. On the other hand, the increase of Nb content also reduced the oxygen vacancy concentration inside the oxide lattice since Nb 5+ has higher valence state than Sr 2+ . Both factors contributed to the decrease of the permeation flux with increasing Nb-doping content in the A-sited doped Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 membranes. Regarding the A and B double-site doping, the D v can be reasonably considered to be a constant with varying Nb-doping concentration due to their similar composition and no phase transition. In this case, the oxygen permeation flux was then mainly determined by the oxygen vacancy concentration. Since Nb took 5+ valence state at the B-site, the increase in Nb-doping content led to a decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration, it then well explains the decrease in permeation flux with increase Nb content. For B-site Nb-doped SrCoO x (SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ), its phase stability under nitrogen atmosphere increased steadily with Nb concentration until a pure perovskite phase was sustained at y \u2265 0.1. At y \u2264 0.1, the oxygen permeation flux was mainly determined by the phase structure of the oxide, the increase in oxygen permeation flux with Nb-doping amount was attributed to the increase of the phase stability under a nitrogen atmosphere. At y \u2265 0.1, the perovskite structure was sustained and the permeation flux was mainly determined by the oxygen vacancy concentration. The increase in Nb-doping content resulted in a decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration due to its higher valence state (5+) when compared to cobalt (3+/4+). This explains the decrease in permeation flux with the further increase of Nb-doping content at y \u2265 0.1. The optimal B-site Nb-doping concentration is y = 0.1. It should be noted that Fig. 6 a also reveals some unusual permeation behavior of membranes with x = 0.025 and 0.05. At temperatures lower than 800 \u00b0C, the permeation flux through the membrane with x = 0.05 is higher than for x = 0.025, whilst for temperatures above 800 \u00b0C, an opposite situation is observed. At this stage, this unusual phenomenon cannot be explained. Among all the Nb-doped SrCoO x oxides, SrCo 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 shows the highest permeation flux and favorable phase stability under oxygen separation conditions. It delivered a permeation flux as high as \u223c3.5 m cm \u22122 min \u22121 [STP] at 900 \u00b0C under air/helium gradient, which is one of the best values in the oxygen permeation fluxes for various oxygen semi-permeable ceramic membranes under similar operation conditions ever reported up to now. Double-site Nb-doped SrCoO x with the composition of Nb 0.025 Sr 0.975 Co 0.975 Nb 0.025 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 showed the second highest permeation flux of 2.7 ml cm \u22122 min \u22121 [STP] at 900 \u00b0C. Both Nb 0.025 Sr 0.975 Co 0.975 Nb 0.025 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and SrCo 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 also demonstrated favorable phase stability under oxygen permeation conditions. Therefore they are highly promising as materials of ceramic membrane for oxygen separation from air. 4 Conclusions Niobium was successfully doped into the A-site, B-site, or simultaneously A and B double sites of the parent SrCoO x oxide. A cubic perovskite structure was obtained in air when the niobium doping range was x = 0.025\u20130.2, y = 0.025\u20130.2 and z = 0.025\u20130.1 for A-site doping (Nb x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 ), B-site doping (SrCo 1\u2212 y Nb y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ) and double-site doping (Nb z Sr 1\u2212 z Co 1\u2212 z Nb z O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ), respectively. The A-site doping, however, was not able to stabilize the cubic structure in a lower oxygen containing or reducing atmosphere like nitrogen. As to B-site doping, the cubic perovskite was sustained in nitrogen only at y \u2265 0.1. Double-site doping is the most effective way to stabilize the cubic structure in nitrogen where no phase transition occurs at z = 0.025\u20130.1. The stabilization of cubic perovskite structure resulted in a sharp increase of electrical conductivity and oxygen permeation fluxes. A maximum conductivity of \u223c450 S cm \u22121 was achieved for SrCo 0.975 Nb 0.025 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 at 300 \u00b0C in air. However, niobium acted as a hopping block for electrons in cubic perovskite structure, consequently, a decrease in electrical conductivity with continually increasing Nb-doping content was observed. Ceramic membranes of Nb 0.025 Sr 0.975 Co 0.975 Nb 0.025 and SrCo 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 show the highest permeation fluxes among the Nb-doped series of SrCoO x oxide with values of 3.5 and 2.7 ml cm \u22122 min \u22121 , respectively. They are promising candidates as materials for air-separation membranes.

A peak power density of approximately 1150 and 573 mW cm \u22122 is reached at 650 and 550 \u00b0C, respectively, for an anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte cell with the optimal composite electrode. The improved performance of a composite electrode containing 70 wt% PrBC and 30 wt% SDC is attributed to a reduction in the diffusion path of oxygen-ions within the electrode, which is a result of a three-dimensional oxygen-ion diffusion path in SDC and a one-dimensional diffusion path in PrBC. Keywords Solid oxide fuel cells Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Composite cathode Praseodymium barium cobalt oxide Layered perovskite 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are high-temperature electrochemical devices that can convert chemical energy to electrical power with high efficiency and low emissions. SOFC single cells are typically composed of a cathode, an anode and an electrolyte, where oxygen reduction reactions occur at the cathode. La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) is a state-of-the-art cathode material for high-temperature SOFCs [1,2] , which performs well at temperatures between 750 and 1000 \u00b0C; the higher temperatures represent the cathode- and electrolyte-supported cells, the lower the anode-supported ones. It is well accepted that the reduction in operating temperatures to the low-to-intermediate temperature range (500\u2013750 \u00b0C) would greatly accelerate the wide application of this attractive new technology [3\u20136] . However, a reduced operating temperature introduces new challenges for the electrodes, electrolytes and fuels. Below 650 \u00b0C the SOFC can be operated only either with hydrogen or with another gas but not the typical ones such as natural gas due to carbon deposition. The active sites for oxygen reduction reaction over a pure electronic conducting electrode are typically located around the triple phase boundary (TPB) regions, where the electrolyte, electrode and gas phase meet [7] . Introduction of an ionic conducting path into the electrode is an effective way to increase TPB length and improve cathode performance. An ionic conducting path can be created by introducing a second phase with high ionic conductivity to form a composite electrode [8\u201311] . Alternatively, an ionic conducting path can be produced by tailoring the composition of single-phase electrodes to introduce oxygen vacancies into the lattice [12,13] . Many mixed oxygen-ionic and electronic conducting oxides have been developed and investigated as potential cathode materials of intermediate temperature (IT) SOFCs [14\u201318] . Over the past several years, LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 has become one of the most desirable types of single-phase cathode materials for intermediate temperature (IT) SOFCs [19\u201325] . These oxides possess a lattice structure related to perovskite, where ordered A-site cations (Ln 3+ and Ba 2+ ) and oxygen vacancies are localized into layers. The ideal structure of these compounds can be represented by the stacking sequence |LnO \u03b4 |CoO 2 |BaO|CoO 2 , which is based on the structure of cubic perovskite. The transformation of a simple cubic perovskite with randomly occupied A sites into a layered crystallite with alternating lanthanide and alkaline-earth planes reduces the strength of oxygen bonding and provides disordered free channels for ionic motion. Therefore, the oxygen in LnO \u03b4 and BaO layers displays high diffusivity, and electron transport in CoO 2 layers is facile. As a result, selected materials display both high ionic and electronic conductivity. Furthermore, these materials may also show high surface exchange kinetics at a reduced temperature [26,27] . Recent investigations from different groups have demonstrated that LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathodes perform well in IT-SOFCs [19\u201325] . Among the various LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides, PrBC has received a considerable amount of attention due to its high surface exchange kinetics and bulk diffusion rate [26,28\u201334] . Recently, we applied a PrBC cathode in reduced temperature SOFCs with an oxygen-ion-conducting samaria-doped ceria electrolyte or a proton-conducting electrolyte [28\u201331] . A peak power density (PPD) as high as 620 mW cm \u22122 with an anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cell and a PrBC cathode and an interfacial polarization resistance as low as 0.4 \u03a9 cm 2 based on symmetric two-electrode cells were achieved at 600 \u00b0C [28] . The high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of PrBC is a significant limitation and is common in cobalt-based perovskite oxides. A second ion-conducting phase composed of the same material as the electrolyte has been added to electrode materials such as LSM, La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3- \u03b4 (LSCF) and Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) to produce a composite electrode that is thermo-mechanically compatible with the electrolyte. Typically, the introduction of a proper amount of a highly conductive second phase to an electrode with poor ionic conductivity significantly increases electrode performance. However, the effect of composite formation on the electrode performance of PrBC cathodes is controversial. For example, Zhu et al. reported a significant improvement in electrode performance by introducing a proper amount of SDC as second phase [33] , while Zhou et al. reported a slight increase in cathodic ASR based on a symmetrical cell test [34] . Thus, further investigation of the performance of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes is necessary. In this study, PrBC was synthesized and investigated as a cathode in IT-SOFCs containing an SDC electrolyte. SDC was introduced as the second phase to form a composite electrode with PrBC by a conventional mechanical mixing technique. The effect of weight ratio of SDC on the thermal expansion behavior and electrode performance was systematically investigated and an explanation for improved electrode performance was proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication PrBC and SDC oxide powders were prepared by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. A detailed procedure for the preparation of PrBC and SDC was reported in a previous publication [35] . Composite oxides of PrBC + SDC were prepared by high energy ball milling (Pulverisette 6) of PrBC (calcined at 950 \u00b0C) and SDC powder (calcined at 850 \u00b0C) in ethanol liquid media for half an hour. SDC electrolytes for symmetric cell and three-electrode cell fabrication were prepared by dry pressing and high-temperature sintering (1450 \u00b0C). To prepare two-electrode symmetric cells, cathode materials were dispersed into a solution of EG, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. The resultant slurry was symmetrically deposited onto both surfaces of the electrolyte by an air-drive spray technique and was fired at 1000 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. To prepare three-electrode cells, a slurry of the composite cathode was deposited on one side of a SDC electrolyte with an area of 0.26 cm 2 and was fired at 1000 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. The resultant electrode was used as a working electrode (WE) in a three-electrode cell. To obtain the counter electrode (CE), a Pt electrode with the same shape as the WE was deposited on the other side of the SDC electrolyte and was fired at 900 \u00b0C in air for 30 min. To obtain the reference electrode (RE), a silver electrode was encircled around the CE, maintaining a 4 mm gap. Anode-supported dual-layer cells with a thin-film SDC electrolyte were fabricated via dual dry pressing [28] . A green anode pellet was obtained by pressing pre-mixed NiO and SDC powder at a 60:40 weight ratio with a 15-mm stainless steel die. To form a dual-layer pellet, a specific amount of SDC powder was dispersed homogeneously over the open surface of the green anode pellet and was pressed with the aforementioned die. The resultant dual-layer pellets were sintered at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. A suspension of cathode material was spray-deposited over the electrolyte surface and was fired at 1000 \u00b0C in air for 2 h to form complete cells with an effective cathode geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 . 2.2 Basic characterization Rectangular-shaped bars with dimensions of 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm were sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h in air and were used for TEC and electrical conductivity measurements. TECs of sintered samples were measured using a Netzsch DIL 402C dilatometer at temperatures between 30 and 900 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 in air. Electrical conductivity was measured according to a four-probe DC method. Two silver wires were used as current leads, while a second set of silver wires were attached to the electrodes and used as voltage probes. A constant current was created between the two current wires, and the voltage was recorded by a Keithley 2420 source meter. The data acquisition and instrument control were performed by Labview (National instrument) software. Measurements were performed between 900 and 300 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C decrements, where a cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 was employed. At each temperature, sufficient time was allowed for the conductivity stabilization. Conductivity was calculated by the following relationship: (1) \u03c3 = 1 R \u00d7 l S where l , S and R represent the length, cross-sectional area and DC resistance, respectively. In oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) experiments, 0.15 g of powdered sample with a mesh size of 40\u201360 was placed into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 3 mm. High-purity helium (>99.999%) was fed into the reactor at a rate of 15 ml min \u22121 (STP). After circulating helium gas at room temperature for half an hour to remove any weakly adsorbed species, the reactor was heated to a final temperature of 930 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . During the heating process, helium transported oxygen molecules, which released from the oxide lattice, to a mass spectrometer (Hiden, QIC-20) for on-line oxygen concentration analysis. 2.3 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. Impedance measurements were conducted between 10 \u22121 and 10 5 Hz, where an ac signal amplitude of 10 mV and zero dc bias were applied. The area specific resistance of the electrode was determined from EIS. The oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere during EIS measurements was controlled at 0.04\u20131 atm by mixing O 2 and N 2 with mass flow controllers. The overall impedance data were collected with ZPlot 2.9c software program and fitted by a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program within ZView 2.9. Cathodic overpotential was measured using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat and Corrware 2.9 c software. The IR drop, originating from the electrolyte and lead/contact resistances, was combined with EIS data to establish IR-free I / E data. 2.4 I \u2013 V polarization test The performance of composite cathodes was evaluated in complete cells at an in-lab SOFC test station. To obtain a fuel cell reactor, the cell was attached to one end of a quartz tube with the anode inside by using silver for sealing. Humidified hydrogen was fed into the anode at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 , while oxygen in ambient air was fed to the cathode. A thermocouple was positioned near the surface of the cathode to monitor and control the temperature. I \u2013 V polarization tests were based on a four lead configuration and were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley 2420). 3 Results 3.1 Thermal expansion coefficient Fig. 1 shows the thermal expansion curves of SDC, pure PrBC, 80 wt% PrBC + 20 wt% SDC and 50 wt% PrBC + 50 wt% SDC composites at 30\u2013900 \u00b0C in air atmosphere and a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . All thermal expansion curves showed a gradual increase in d L / L 0 with an increase in temperature. In a single-phase SDC pellet, linear thermal expansion curves were observed over the entire temperature range (30\u2013900 \u00b0C). However, the thermal expansion curves of PrBC revealed an obvious change in slope around 300 \u00b0C. Similar results were also observed for 80 wt% PrBC + 20 wt% SDC composites, while a change in slope was less obvious in curves derived from 50 wt% PrBC + 50 wt% SDC composites. The average TEC of each sample was derived from thermal expansion data. Results indicated that the TEC of SDC was 12.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 between 30 and 900 \u00b0C, which is similar to the TEC reported by Pikalova et al. (12.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 ) [36] . Pure PrBC possessed a TEC of 23.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 between 30 and 900 \u00b0C, which is similar to the results of Zhou et al., who reported a TEC of 21.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 [34] . A high TEC is frequently observed for cobalt-rich perovskite oxides such as Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) [37] and SSC [38] . Compared to pure PrBC, the introduction of SDC into PrBC led to a decrease in TEC. Specifically, higher amounts of SDC caused a decrease in the TEC, while a TEC of 21.3 and 17.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 was observed for 80 wt% PrBC + 20 wt% SDC and 50 wt% PrBC + 50 wt% SDC composites, respectively. Furthermore, the TEC of composite electrodes were fitted to the following equation: (2) TE C Composite \u2009\u200a\u200a ( y % A + ( 1 \u2212 y % ) B ) = y % TE C A + ( 1 \u2212 y % ) TE C B where y , A and B denote the volume fraction, PrBC and SDC, respectively. 3.2 DC conductivity For practical applications, the electrode materials should possess sufficient electrical conductivity to ensure efficient current collection and to minimize contact resistance, especially under a high polarization current density. Fig. 2 a shows the DC conductivity of PrBC and various PrBC + SDC composites with various amounts of SDC between 300 and 900 \u00b0C. The total conductivity of pure PrBC was between 1065 S cm \u22121 (900 \u00b0C) and 320 S cm \u22121 (300 \u00b0C), which is comparable to the results reported in the literature [34] . A linear decrease in conductivity with a decrease in temperature was also observed, suggesting that PrBC displays conduction behavior similar to metals. By introducing SDC as a second phase, a drop in electrical conductivity was observed, where higher amounts of SDC resulted in a decrease in conductivity. For example, the total conductivity at 600 \u00b0C was 590, 454, 377, 312, 248 and 152 S cm \u22121 for PrBC and PrBC + SDC composites containing 90, 80, 70, 60 and 50 wt% SDC, respectively. However, even 50 wt% PrBC + 50 wt% PrBC composites displayed high conductivity, which reached approximately 200 S cm \u22121 at 300 \u00b0C and 90 S cm \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 2 a. Moreover, the effect of temperature on electrical conductivity was less prominent with an increase in SDC content. In Fig. 2 b, electrical conductivity data are presented as a plot of log ( \u03c3 T ) vs. 1000/ T . The results clearly indicate a change in the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity with an increase in SDC content. 3.3 O 2 -TPD O 2 -TPD is a facile and effective technique for the analysis of bulk oxygen mobility and surface oxygen activity of the oxide. In a typical O 2 -TPD experiment, the sample is programmatically heated in a flowing inert atmosphere, resulting in the thermal reduction of cobalt in the oxide lattice and a subsequent release of oxygen. The release of oxygen from the oxide involves both bulk diffusion and surface reactions. The shape of the O 2 -TPD profile is closely related to the bulk and surface properties of the oxide. Fig. 3 shows the O 2 -TPD profiles of PrBC and PrBC + SDC composites with various amounts of SDC, calcined at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. All peaks were normalized based on the amount of PrBC in the composite. For comparison, the O 2 -TPD profile of SDC is also presented, where the dissociation of oxygen from SDC was not observed because cobalt oxides are not present in SDC. In pure PrBC oxide, oxygen was released in two temperature zones, where the first dissociation began at 300 \u00b0C and ended at approximately 500 \u00b0C, while the second release began at 800 \u00b0C. These two peaks were identified as the \u03b1 peak and \u03b2 peak, respectively. A progressive change in the shape of the \u03b1 peak and \u03b2 peak was observed with an increase in SDC content. 3.4 Symmetric two-electrode measurement Fig. 4 shows EIS data of PrBC and PrBC + SDC composites at 600 \u00b0C in air under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. For a more clear comparison, the ohmic resistance of cells was eliminated in the EIS. The difference between the axis intercepts of the EIS plot can be considered the electrode polarization resistance ( R p ). EIS plots clearly indicate that the SDC content had a significant effect on the electrode polarization resistance of the electrodes, where the calculated values are shown in Fig. 4 . The R p decreased with an increase in SDC content, reached a minimum at a SDC content of 30% and increased sharply with a further increase in SDC. The polarization resistances were 0.386, 0.362, 0.271, 0.252, 0.365 and 0.561 \u03a9 cm 2 for PrBC and PrBC + SDC composites containing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt% SDC, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the EIS of various PrBC + SDC composite electrodes at 600 \u00b0C under selected atmospheres, where the p O 2 varied from 0.04 to 1 atm. As shown in Fig. 5 f, the equivalent circuit L\u2013 R ohm \u2013( R E1 \u2013CPE1)\u2013( R E2 \u2013CPE2) was adopted to fit EIS data. L corresponded to the high-frequency induction tail caused by the device and leads, R ohm was the ohmic resistance of the cell and ( R E1 \u2013CPE1) and ( R E2 \u2013CPE2) corresponded to the high and low arcs, respectively. The solid lines in Fig. 5 are the fitted curves by using the aforementioned equivalent circuit, while the points indicate experimental data. The impedance data and fitted curves were in good agreement, which suggests that the equivalent circuit is an appropriate approximation for both single-phase and composite cathodes. Fig. 6 presents the R E1 and R E2 of PrBC and the various PrBC + SDC composite electrodes, derived from Fig. 5 , as a function of the oxygen partial pressure at 600 \u00b0C in Arrhenius plots. The results indicate that the slope of ln(1/ R E1 ) vs. ln( p O 2 ) was between 0.18 and 0.20, while the slope of ln(1/ R E2 ) and ln( p O 2 ) was between 0.33 and 0.40 for PrBC and PrBC + SDC electrodes. In general, each elemental process displays a unique dependence on the p O 2 , where a value of 0.25 usually corresponds to a charge transfer process and a value of 0.5 corresponds to surface diffusion [39] . Based on the aforementioned results and previous observations of PrBC electrodes [28] , the high-frequency arc was likely associated with charge transfer processes, while the low frequency arc was associated with surface diffusion. As shown in Fig. 2 , PrBC is highly conductive; thus, R E1 was less likely due to electron charge transfer process while R E1 may be a result of oxygen-ion charge transfer process. The results shown in Fig. 7 analyzed to determine the effect of SDC content on the R E1 and R E2 of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes. In general, R E1 decreased monotonously with an increase in SDC content. As to R E2 , it decreased slightly with an increase in SDC amount at low SDC content until it reached 20\u201330 wt%, then the R E2 increased sharply with the further increase in SDC content. A similar trend was observed at all investigated oxygen partial pressures. Clearly, the best performance achieved for the PrBC + SDC composite electrode containing 30 wt% SDC is due to both small R E1 and R E2 , while the large R p at high SDC content is mainly due to the sharp increase in R E2 . 3.5 Three-electrode measurement Cathodic overpotential is an important component of electrode performance. To further investigate the effect of SDC content on electrode performance, three-electrode cells were constructed and cathodic polarization analysis was performed on PrBC + SDC composite electrodes. Fig. 8 presents the IR-corrected Tafel plots of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes with various amounts of SDC at 600 \u00b0C in air. The cathodic overpotential decreased with an increase in SDC and reached a minimum at 30 wt% SDC. A further increase in SDC content caused an increase in the cathodic overpotential. A similar trend was observed in the symmetric cell test. At an overpotential of \u22120.15 V, the current density was approximately 198, 344, 430, 174 and 110 mA cm \u22122 for PrBC + SDC composite electrodes with a SDC content of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%, respectively. The exchange current density, i 0 , is a direct reflection of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and was calculated according to the Bulter\u2013Volmer equation: (3) i = i 0 exp \u03b1 a F \u03b7 R T \u2212 exp \u2212 \u03b1 c F \u03b7 R T In high field overpotential, the anodic reaction can be ignored and i 0 can be obtained from the y -intercept of a plot of log i vs. \u03b7. Thus, i 0 was calculated according to the following equation: (4) Log \u2009 i = Log \u2009 i 0 \u2212 \u03b1 c n F 2.303 R T \u03b7 where \u03b7 is the cathodic overpotential and \u03b1 c is the cathodic coefficient, n is the total number of transferred electrons, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The cathodic coefficient can be calculated by: \u03b1 c = \u03b3 \u03bd + r \u03b2 where \u03b3, r and \u03b2 are the number of electrons transferred before the rate limiting step, the number of electrons transferred during the rate limiting step, and the symmetry coefficient (typically assumed to be 0.5), respectively. The i 0 of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes with a SDC content of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt% was approximately 65, 114, 200, 55 and 35 mA cm \u22122 , respectively. Again, the composite electrode containing 30 wt% SDC showed the highest exchange current density. 3.6 Single cell performance The electrochemical performance of the various electrodes was further investigated in a complete cell. Anode-supported cells with a Ni + SDC anode, a thin-film SDC electrolyte (approximately 25 \u03bcm) and PrBC + SDC cathodes were fabricated. Fig. 9 shows the peak power densities (PPD), power densities at 0.7 V (0.7PD) and shorted current densities (SCD) of cells with different cathodes at 600 \u00b0C. A PPD and 0.7PD of 620 and 400 mW cm \u22122 was achieved with a pure PrBC cathode. The PPD and 0.7PD increased progressively with an increase in SDC content until the concentration of SDC reached 30 wt%. The cell containing a composite cathode composed of 70 wt% PrBC + 30 wt% SDC delivered a PPD of 875 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C, which is comparable to a similar cell with a BSCF electrode [5] . However, a composite electrode with a greater SDC content led to decreased cell performance. For example, the PPD and 0.7PD of a fuel cell with a 50 wt% PrBC + 50 wt% SDC composite cathode was only 425 and 197 mW cm \u22122 , which is even lower than a cell with a pure PrBC cathode. Except for the composition of the cathode, all cell materials and fabrication processes were identical in each cell; thus, significant differences in cell performance were due to the performance of the cathode. The observed trend in single cell performance matched the electrochemical performance of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes in a symmetric cell test and three-electrode overpotential test. Fig. 10 shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the cell containing a 70 wt% PrBC + 30 wt% SDC cathode at various temperatures. A PPD of 1150 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 650 \u00b0C. The corresponding cell impedance of the single cell at OCV conditions is shown in Fig. 10 b. At 650 \u00b0C, the ohmic resistance of the cell was approximately 0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 , while the electrode polarization resistance of the cell was 0.05 \u03a9 cm 2 . At 550 \u00b0C, the electrode polarization resistance (0.16 \u03a9 cm 2 ) was still lower than the ohmic resistance of the cell (0.215 \u03a9 cm 2 ). The electrode polarization resistance began to play a dominant role in total cell resistance at 450 \u00b0C. 4 Discussion 4.1 Thermal expansion behavior The thermal expansion of oxygen deficient perovskites can be contributed to two phenomena; actual thermal expansion created by atomic vibration of the lattice or chemical expansion associated with a change in valence and spin state of the cations. In connection with O 2 -TPD results in Fig. 3 , thermal expansion at temperatures less than 300 \u00b0C (before the change in slope) was caused by atomic vibrations of the lattice. The dramatic increase in thermal expansion after the change in slope was a result of chemical expansion due to the generation of oxygen vacancies and changes in the spin or/and oxidation state of B-site cations (cobalt). It has been reported that a physical mixture of two compounds with different TECs results in a composite TEC that is a volumetric average of the constituent materials [40] . However, phase reactions between components may alter thermal expansion behavior [41] . Previously, we demonstrated that a phase reaction between PrBC and SDC does not occur at temperatures up to 1100 \u00b0C [28] . Furthermore, the TEC of composites was equal to the volumetric average of PrBC and SDC, which further supported a lack of phase reactions between PrBC and SDC in the composites. Thus, an increase in SDC content results in a reduced TEC and produces an electrode that is thermo-mechanically compatible with a SDC electrolyte. 4.2 Electrode performance The introduction of a highly ionic conductive second phase and subsequent formation of a composite electrode is frequently conducted to improve electrode performance at reduced temperatures. For example, the introduction of YSZ or GDC to LSM to obtain LSM + YSZ/GDC composites can significantly increase electrode performance between 650 and 850 \u00b0C as compared to pure LSM [8,42] . It is believed that the creation of ionic diffusion paths within the bulk of the electrode is the main cause for such obvious improvement in electrode performance. The creation of ionic conduction paths within the interior of the electrode extends the active sites of oxygen reduction from the traditional TPB region to the entire exposed surface of the cathode. This theory also explains the improved performance of LSCF + SDC and SSC + SDC composite cathodes compared to pure LSCF or SSC electrodes at reduced temperatures. It is well known that LSCF and SSC are mixed conductors and possess considerable ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures. However, at temperatures lower than 650 \u00b0C, the ionic conductivity of LSCF and SSC is negligible. The introduction of a second phase containing SDC, which has a reported ionic conductivity of approximately 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 at 600 \u00b0C, can effectively increase the apparent conductivity of the electrode and improve cell performance. GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (GdBC) has an ionic conductivity of 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 at 500 \u00b0C [27] , which is comparable to SDC at 600 \u00b0C. Moreover, greater bulk diffusion is observed in PrBC than GdBC [26] , which indicates that PrBC has a higher ionic conductivity than SDC at intermediate-to-low temperatures. The enhanced performance of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes cannot be fully explained by the creation formation of ionic conduction paths. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that the performance of BSCF + SDC composite electrodes was not significantly improved compared to pure BSCF electrodes because pure BSCF is a good ionic conductor at reduced temperatures [43] . LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 double perovskite oxides are one-dimensional materials with respect to oxygen diffusion, where fast oxygen diffusion channels exist only in the LnO \u03b4 planes. Alternatively, the oxygen diffusion rate perpendicular to LnO \u03b4 planes is negligible [27,44,45] . Under the experimental conditions, LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 was polycrystalline and was composed of many small crystals in a random orientation. The polycrystalline structure and one-dimensional oxygen diffusion characteristics of PrBC could result in a tortuous path for oxygen diffusion. Therefore, the apparent ionic conductivity of polycrystalline LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathodes may be significantly lower than the conductivity of the single crystal. Indeed, we demonstrated that a ceramic membrane composed of polycrystalline PrBC displayed a lower oxygen permeation flux than a BSCF membrane, which possesses a cubic perovskite structure and three-dimensional oxygen diffusion paths [31] . As shown in Fig. 5 , the large R E1 of polycrystalline PrBC electrodes clearly supported a relatively low apparent ionic conductivity. Based on the above analysis, the improved performance of PrBC + SDC composites can be explained by the mechanism shown in Fig. 11 . In a pure PrBC electrode, due to its polycrystalline structure, the oxygen diffusion path is very tortuous ( Fig. 11 a). As a result, porous polycrystalline PrBC electrodes possess relatively low oxygen conductivity, and the effective thickness of the active PrBC layer for oxygen reduction is relatively thin. Due to the relatively low ionic conductivity and high surface exchange kinetics of PrBC, the electrode polarization resistance of polycrystalline PrBC electrodes was contributed to oxygen-ion charge transfer processes and resulted in a R E1 that was greater than R E2 . As shown in Fig. 11 b, the introduction of an ionic conducting phase allowed SDC particles to connect PrBC grains, which shortened the path for ionic diffusion and extended the effective thickness of the active layer of the electrode for oxygen reduction. Thus, the introduction of a small amount of SDC (10\u201330 wt%) reduced R E1 and R E2 ; however, the reduction in R E1 was greater than the reduction in R E2 . Clearly, an increase in SDC decreased the tortuosity of the oxygen diffusion path and caused a monotonous decrease in the R E1 associated with the charge transfer process, as shown in Fig. 7 . The sharp increase in R E2 at SDC concentrations greater than 30 wt% may be explained by surface exchange kinetics. Although the introduction of SDC increased the apparent conductivity of the electrode, it also decreased the surface activity, as PrBC has much higher surface exchange kinetics than SDC. At high concentrations of SDC, a large area of the PrBC surface was likely covered by SDC, blocking oxygen diffusion, which can also be directly observed in O 2 -TPD curves in Fig. 3 . As a result, the polarization resistance associated with surface diffusion ( R E2 ) increased sharply with an increase in SDC concentration greater than 30 wt%. 5 Conclusions The amount of SDC in PrBC + SDC composites has a significant effect on the thermal expansion coefficient, total conductivity, oxygen release rate, oxygen-ion conduction in the electrode and oxygen diffusion at the surface of PrBC. The introduction of SDC into PrBC reduced the TEC and electrical conductivity of the electrodes. However, even at SDC concentrations as high as 50 wt%, the total conductivity of the composite remained high, and the composite electrodes could be successfully used as cathodes in SOFCs. By adopting a 70 wt% PrBC + 30 wt% SDC composite electrode, a low area specific resistance of only 0.25 \u03a9 cm 2 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C, which is smaller than the resistance of pure PrBC electrodes. The improved performance of PrBC + SDC composite electrodes is due to an increase in the apparent oxygen-ionic conductivity. With an anode-supported thin-film electrolyte cell containing a 70 wt% PrBC + 30 wt% SDC composite electrode, a peak power density of 1150 and 573 mW cm \u22122 was successfully achieved at 650 and 550 \u00b0C, respectively. These exciting results indicate that PrBC-based composite electrodes can be applied to reduced-temperature SOFCs.

        "title": "Evaluation of A-site cation-deficient (Ba0.5Sr0.5)1-xCo0.8Fe0.2O3-\u03b4 (x > 0) perovskite as a solid-oxide fuel cell cathode",
        "abstract": "A-site cation-deficient (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 1\u2212 x Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ((BS) 1\u2212 x CF) oxides were synthesized and evaluated as cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs). The material's thermal expansion coefficient, electrical conductivity, oxygen desorption property, and electrocatalytic activity were measured. A decrease in both the electronic conductivity and the thermal expansion coefficient was observed for increasing values of the stoichiometric coefficient, x . This effect was attributed to the creation of additional oxygen vacancies, the suppression of variation in the oxidation states of cobalt and iron, and the suppression of the spin-state transitions of cobalt ions. The increase in A-site cation deficiency resulted in a steady increase in cathode polarization resistance, because impurities formed at the cathode/electrolyte interface, reducing the electronic conductivity. A single SOFC equipped with a BS 0.97 CF cathode exhibited peak power densities of 694 and 893 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively, and these results were comparable with those obtained with a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode. Slightly A-site cation-deficient (BS) 1\u2212 x CF oxides were still highly promising cathodes for reduced temperature SOFCs. Keywords (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 1\u2212 x Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cathode Intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 1 Introduction Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are electrochemical power generation devices characterized by high-energy conversion efficiency, low emission, and excellent fuel flexibility. Typical SOFCs operate at \u223c1000 \u00b0C, and elevated temperatures introduce a series of problems such as the sintering of electrodes, high reactivity between cell components, and strict requirements on interconnected materials. Consequently, there is increasing interest in intermediate-temperature (IT)-SOFCs, which are operated in the range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C [1\u20135] . The decrease in operating temperature, however, increases the cells\u2019 overpotential, and the main contributor to this increase is the cathode [6,7] . The development of new cathode materials with low polarization resistance is therefore of great importance to achieving high power densities at reduced temperatures. SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 -based, mixed ionic and electronic conducting materials, such as La 1\u2212 x Sr x Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [8\u201311] , Sm 1\u2212 x Sr x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 [12\u201315] , and Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [16\u201320] , are promising candidates for cathode material for use in reduced temperature SOFCs. In the Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 family, Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction because of its high oxygen surface-exchange kinetics and high oxygen bulk diffusion rate at intermediate temperatures [21] . On the other hand, some studies have demonstrated that introducing A-site cation deficiencies into the lattice structure of perovskite oxides significantly alters the material's physical and chemical properties [22\u201326] . For example, Kostogloudis and Ftikos observed that the A-site cation-deficient compound, (La 0.6 Sr 0.4 ) 1\u2212 x Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , had both a lower thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and a lower electronic conductivity than the corresponding cation-stoichiometric material (La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ) [22] . Mineshige et al. suggested that the reduced electronic conductivity could be attributed to the creation of additional oxygen vacancies [23] . Very recently, it was confirmed that additional oxygen vacancies are indeed beneficial to the oxygen reduction reaction [24] . The superior performance of A-site cation-deficient LSCF cathodes was also reported by Doshi et al., who found that the initial cathode resistance was as low as 0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 at 500 \u00b0C [25] . In our recent investigation of mixed oxygen-conducting membranes, we observed that introducing the proper amount of A-site cation deficiency into BSCF (i.e., the formation of a (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 1\u2212 x Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ((BS) 1\u2212 x CF) oxide) significantly improved the membrane's oxygen permeability [27] . It was also demonstrated that creating additional oxygen vacancies from the A-site deficiencies facilitated oxygen ion diffusion within the oxide bulk, and that this effect was responsible for the improved oxygen permeability of the related membranes. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effect of A-site cation deficiency on the performance of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF ( x = 0.03\u20130.20) perovskite cathodes in ITSOFCs fabricated with a samaria-doped ceria electrolyte. The thermal expansion properties, electrical conductivities, electrochemical properties, and phase reactions between the cathode and the electrolyte of these materials were investigated. Taking all these factors into account, an optimal concentration of A-site cation-deficiencies was proposed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis and cell fabrication The (BS) 1\u2212 x CF oxide powders were synthesized via a standard combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. The procedure is described in detail in our previous publications [28,29] . Metal nitrates Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 , and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 were used as the raw materials. Each metal nitrate was prepared as a separate aqueous solution, and a standard EDTA titration method was used to determine the precise concentrations of these solutions. In accordance with the composition of the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF material, the required amounts of metal nitrate solutions were mixed, and EDTA and citric acid were added to serve as complexing agents. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to \u223c6 with NH 4 OH. The molar ratio of total metal ions/EDTA/citric acid was set at 1:1:2. The water was evaporated at 90 \u00b0C yielding transparent gels. The gels were pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and then calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere, and the resulting products possessed the desired final phase structure. Symmetrical cells with electrode|SDC|electrode configurations were fabricated for the impedance studies. Dense SDC pellets, which were 12.0 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm thick, were prepared through dry pressing. The pellets were then sintered at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h. The (BS) 1\u2212 x CF cathode powder was first dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol, and a colloidal suspension was formed via high-energy ball milling (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6) at 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The resulting slurry was painted onto both surfaces of the SDC pellet in symmetric fashion and subsequently calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The performance of the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF cathode was also evaluated in a complete electrochemical cell. Anode-supported thin-film electrolyte dual-layer cells were prepared via dual dry-pressing and subsequent high-temperature sintering [30] . Anode powders consisting of 60 wt% NiO and 40 wt% SDC were prepared through the mechanical mixing of NiO and SDC in an agate mortar. The electrolyte of the green bi-layer pellets was densified through firing at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. The cathode slurry was then painted onto the central surface of the densified electrolyte and fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The resulting coin-shaped cathode was 10\u201320 \u03bcm thick and had an effective area of 0.42 cm 2 . 2.2 Basic characterizations The chemical compatibility between the cathode and the electrolyte materials was assessed. Powders consisting of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF ( x = 0.03\u20130.20) (70 wt%) and SDC (30 wt%) were well mixed and calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The phase composition of the mixture after firing was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) at room temperature. The oxygen desorption properties of the materials were studied using an oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 \u2013TPD) technique. About 150 mg of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF powders were loaded into a quartz tube, which was then placed into a single-zone temperature programmable tube furnace. Argon carrier gas flowed through the tube at a rate of 20 ml min \u22121 (STP: standard temperature and pressure). The temperature was increased from 50 to 950 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 , and the effluent gases were monitored with a mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden, QIC-20). The calcined powder was palletized in the form of rectangular bars of dimensions of 6 mm \u00d7 6 mm \u00d7 20 mm under a uniaxial pressure of 200 MPa, and then fired at 1200 \u00b0C for 5 h for both the measurements of electrical conductivities and thermal expansion coefficients. All the samples used for the measurements had densities of >93% of the theoretical values. The electrical conductivities were measured via four-terminal DC technique using Ag paste electrodes. The current and voltage were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter at intervals of 5 \u00b0C over a temperature range of 300\u2013900 \u00b0C under an air atmosphere. TECs were measured using a Netsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer from room temperature to 750 \u00b0C with an air-purge flow rate of 50 ml min \u22121 . 2.3 Electrochemical performance test An electrochemical cell with a four-terminal configuration was constructed, and the I \u2013 V polarization was measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter. Humidified (3% H 2 O) H 2 fuel was fed into the anode chamber at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 (STP), and ambient air served as the oxidant gas. Gas flow rates were controlled with mass flow controllers, and silver paste was used as the current collector. The electrode performance was investigated via an ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The applied frequency range was from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions. The overall impedance data were fitted using the complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program from the Z-View 2.9b software. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure The X-ray diffraction patterns of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF ( x = 0.00\u20130.30), acquired at room temperature are presented in Fig. 1 . The oxides with x = 0.0\u20130.15 possess a perovskite phase structure with cubic symmetry, while oxides with x = 0.20 possess a (Fe,Co) 3 O 4 impurity phase. This suggests that the A-site cation deficiency fraction ( x ) was limited to approximately 0.15 for (BS) 1\u2212 x CF. As the A-site cation deficiency increases up to values of x = 0.20, the main diffraction peaks of the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF perovskite gradually shift to higher values of 2 \u03b8 , which indicates shrinkage of the perovskite lattice. In our previous study, we found that charge-balance of A-site deficient BSCF was compensated by creation of additional oxygen vacancies in BSCF lattice [27] . The increase of oxygen vacancies may promote the electrochemical catalytic activity for oxygen reduction. 3.2 Thermal expansion TECs of both the electrolyte and electrode layers must be well matched to ensure long-term SOFC operational stability. One distinguishing feature of cobalt-based cathode materials is their high TECs [31] . This property is attributed to crystal expansion from anharmonic atomic vibrations, which depend on the electrostatic attraction forces within the lattice [31] , and to chemical expansion, which is induced by both the cobalt ion spin transition and the thermal/chemical reduction of cobalt ions to lower oxidation states [32] . The thermal expansion curves for the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF ( x = 0\u20130.20) materials are presented in Fig. 2 , and the calculated TEC values for different temperature ranges are listed in Table 1 . The TEC is highly dependent upon both the A-site cation deficiency fraction ( x ) and the selected temperature range. The TECs decrease with increasing the A-site cation deficiency, especially in the 450\u2013750 \u00b0C temperature range. Both Kostogloudis and Ftikos [22] and Hansen and Vels Hansen [24] reported similar trends for (La 0.6 Sr 0.4 ) 1\u2212 x Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.00\u20130.15) oxides. Increased electrostatic attraction resulting from decreases in the lattice parameter may be responsible for this phenomenon. The TEC of the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF perovskites is also closely correlated with the chemical expansion effects resulting from changes in the point defect concentration and the spin state of cobalt ions [24] . At elevated temperatures, the release of molecular oxygen, which can be detected in situ using a mass spectrometer, follows the thermal reduction of the cobalt and iron ions in (BS) 1\u2212 x CF. Temperature-programmed oxygen desorption curves (O 2 \u2013TPD), measured for (BS) 1\u2212 x CF oxides with varying A-site cation deficiency, are depicted in Fig. 3 . Oxygen desorption is observed for two separate onset temperatures, approximately 300 and 800 \u00b0C, and for the sake of convenience these desorption processes are labeled \u03b1- and \u03b2-oxygen [33] . The lower-temperature oxygen desorption process (\u03b1-oxygen) is associated with the reduction of Co 4+ and/or Fe 4+ to Co 3+ and/or Fe 3+ , respectively, and the \u03b2-oxygen desorption process is associated with the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . The total amount of desorbed \u03b1-oxygen decreases with increasing A-site deficiency, but the total amount of desorbed \u03b2-oxygen increases ( Table 2 ). In combination with previous results ( Table 1 ), it is likely that the thermal reduction of Co 4+ /Fe 4+ to Co 3+ /Fe 3+ within the 400\u2013700 \u00b0C temperature range is more responsible than within the 50\u2013400 \u00b0C temperature range for the higher TEC. Increasing the A-site cation deficiency suppresses thermal reduction, and within the narrow temperature range of 700\u2013750 \u00b0C, a sharp increase in TEC is observed ( Fig. 2 ). No obvious thermal reduction occurs within this temperature range ( Fig. 3 ). Such an abnormal increase in TEC is therefore attributed to the low to high transition of the Co 2+ /Co 3+ spin-state, because large variations in ionic size are observed to accompany this spin-state transition ( Table 3 ). These results suggest that A-site cation deficiency successfully suppresses the thermally induced spin-state transition. The abnormal thermal expansion behavior of (BS) 0.80 CF in the 450\u2013700 \u00b0C temperature range may be related to the formation of impurities. 3.3 Electrical conductivity A cathode material should possess sufficient electrical conductivity to ensure efficient current collection; thus, the effect of A-site cation deficiency on the electrical conductivity of the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF oxide was investigated, and is presented in Fig. 4 . The electrical conductivity of all oxide samples initially increases linearly with temperature up to a transition temperature ( T s ) between 450 and 550 \u00b0C, but after this point the conductivity reaches a plateau for temperatures exceeding T s ( Fig. 4 ). The thermal reduction of Co 4+ /Fe 4+ to Co 3+ /Fe 3+ creates additional oxygen vacancies and thus disrupts the O\u2013(Fe,Co)\u2013O periodic potential. This, in turn, decreases the concentration of charge carriers and the covalent interaction, and may cause the observed changes in conductivity [34\u201336] . Across all values of x examined, the conductivity decreases as the A-site cation deficiency increases. For example, the maximum conductivity of BSCF is 42 S cm \u22121 , but that of (BS) 0.8 CF is only 25 S cm \u22121 . This trend differs from that observed for A-site cation-deficient (La 0.6 Sr 0.4 ) 1\u2212 x Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.00\u20130.15) perovskite oxides, which show an initial increase in electrical conductivity with increasing A-site cation deficiency for values of x up to 0.05 [24] . Such behavior is closely related to the concurrent transition of the perovskite phase structure from rhombohedral to cubic symmetry. The increased cell symmetry improves overlap between the transition metal 3d orbitals and the oxygen 2p orbitals [24] . Introducing A-site cation deficiency does not, however, improve the cell symmetry of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF, and so the conductivity decreases monotonically from the creation of additional oxygen vacancies. Nevertheless, contrary to expectations, further increases in A-site cation deficiency up to x = 0.20 increase conductivity, and this effect may be related to the formation of impurities ( Fig. 1 ). 3.4 Chemical compatibility The (BS) 1\u2212 x CF and SDC mixture, which was calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere, was analyzed with XRD, and results are presented in Fig. 5 . In addition to the characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to (BS) 1\u2212 x CF perovskite and SDC fluorite, peaks are also observed at 2 \u03b8 = 32.3\u00b0 and 36.3\u00b0. This indicates that a solid-state reaction between (BS) 1\u2212 x CF and SDC occurred. The impurities, identified as perovskite with the composition (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , were formed when the Sm 3+ and Ce 3+ from the SDC were incorporated into the A-sites of the (BS) 1\u2212 x CF. Wang et al. found that (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite oxides have lower catalytic activity for oxygen reduction [37] . Li et al. found that the substitution of the A-site of BSCF by the rare earth elements could reduce the TEC of BSCF slightly [38,39] . Therefore, the formation of impurities may be not detrimental to the long-term stability of the cathode. 3.5 Impedance analysis The performance of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF ( x = 0.00, 0.03, 0.09, and 0.20, fired at 1000 \u00b0C) as the cathode in a symmetrical cell configuration was investigated via ac impedance spectroscopy under an air atmosphere. The Nyquist plots of the cells were obtained at 600 \u00b0C under open-circuit conditions, and are given in Fig. 6 . All impedance spectra contain two separable depressed arcs, suggesting that at least two different electrode processes limit the oxygen reduction reaction. In order to separate these two processes, the impedance spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit with a standardized configuration ( Fig. 6 e). The inductances of the circuits, L , may be the result of the Ag current/voltage probes or the high frequency phase shift of the electrochemical equipment. The overall ohmic resistance, R ohm , includes the electrolyte resistance, the electrode ohmic resistance, and the lead resistance. The high-frequency resistance is probably associated with charge-transfer processes ( R E1 ). The low-frequency arc is ascribed to diffusion processes ( R E2 ), including the adsorption\u2013desorption of oxygen, oxygen diffusion at the gas\u2013cathode interface, and the surface diffusion of intermediate oxygen species [40\u201347] . Parameters Q 1 and Q 2 are constant phase elements and their impedances are expressed as follows [47] : (1) Q = 1 B ( j \u03c9 ) \u03b1 where B is a frequency-independent constant, \u03c9 is the angular frequency ( \u03c9 = 2 \u03c0f ), j is the square root of \u22121, and \u03b1 is an exponential constant. For \u03b1 = 1, 0.5, 0, and \u22121, Q represents an ideal capacitance, a Warburg impedance, an ideal resistance, and an inductance, respectively. The fitted impedance parameters are given in Table 4 . For the cathode composed of BSCF, which is not cation deficient ( x = 0), the high-frequency arc is smaller than the low-frequency arc. This implies that surface diffusion processes are the rate-determining step in the oxygen reduction reaction at 600 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 a). When the A-site cation deficiency increases, the rate-determining step changes from oxygen surface diffusion to charge-transfer processes. It is likely that the additional oxygen vacancies, which are the result of A-site cation deficiency, promote oxygen surface-exchange processes. The reduction in diffusion polarization resistance, however, is smaller than the increase in charge-transfer resistance, and overall cathode performance deteriorates with increased A-site cation deficiency. For example, the diffusion resistance of (BS) 0.80 CF is reduced by a factor of about 2.5 relative to that of BSCF, but the charge-transfer resistance increases to more than 5.4 times its original value. Consequently, the change in charge-transfer polarization resistance dominates the net change in the polarization resistance of the (BS) 0.80 CF electrode. Charge-transfer processes include the ion-transfer processes occurring at electrode/electrolyte interfaces and the electron-transfer processes accompanying oxygen reduction. In order to obtain a better understanding of the relevant charge-transfer processes, the capacitance ( C ) and relaxation frequency ( f ) of the simulated circuits were calculated using Eqs. (2) and (3) [48] , respectively. (2) C = ( R Q ) 1 / n R , (3) f = \u03c9 2 \u03c0 . In Eq. (3) , \u03c9 is the relaxation frequency, given as follows [49] : (4) \u03c9 = ( R Q ) \u2212 1 / n As shown in Table 5 , The capacitance and relaxation frequency of the charge-transfer processes occurring with (BS) 1\u2212 x CF ( x = 0.00, 0.03, 0.09, and 0.20) are in the ranges of 10\u2013100 mF cm \u22122 and 10\u20131000 Hz, respectively. Both ranges are typical for the chemical reduction of oxygen accompanied by electron-transfer processes [47,50] , while the reported capacitance and relaxation frequency values for the ion-transfer processes of cation-stoichiometric BSCF are 42 \u03bcF cm \u22122 and 160 kHz, respectively [51] . In our previous study, we observed that the reciprocal resistance values of the high-frequency arc from BSCF have roughly a 1/4 dependence oxygen partial pressure [52] , and this is strong evidence that the electron-transfer steps of oxygen reduction are limited in the BSCF cathode [47] . It also suggested that the high-frequency arc measured in this study can be attributed solely to electron-transfer processes. The increased electron-transfer resistance associated with increased A-site cation deficiency is likely the result of impurities formed at the triple-phase boundary (3PB). Interestingly, the impurity phases formed at the cathode/electrolyte interface do not have observable effects on ion-transfer processes. This is very different from the case of Ba- and Sr-enriched barium strontium cobalt ferrites, i.e., (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 1.20 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ((BS) 1.2 CF). For these materials, it was found that the solid-state reaction between BS 1.2 CF and SDC results in the formation of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Ba(Sr)CeO 3 perovskites [53] . Such impurities not only deteriorate electron transfer at the 3PB but also decrease ion transfer at the cathode/electrolyte two-phase boundary (2PB). This difference in behavior is explained schematically in Fig. 7 . Although the (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides have lower electrocatalytic activity and ionic conductivity than BSCF, their cathodic performances are still superior in IT-SOFCs [37,54] . The BaCeO 3 phase, however, has much lower electrocatalytic activity and ionic conductivity than those of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides. The formation of BaCeO 3 between the (BS) 1.20 CF and SDC interface significantly inhibits oxide ion transfer across this interface ( Fig. 7 b). On the other hand, the oxygen ionic conductivity of the cathode material also affects the charge-transfer processes. For the BSCF cathode, which is not cation-deficient, oxygen surface exchange is the rate-determining step in oxygen reduction, because oxygen has a high bulk diffusion rate. This effectively extends the BSCF cathode's active zone of oxygen reduction across the entire cathode surface. Under these conditions, charge transfer occurs at both the gas\u2013cathode\u2013electrolyte 3PB and the gas\u2013cathode two-phase boundary. Since (BS) 0.97 CF demonstrates higher oxygen permeability than non-cation-deficient BSCF [27] , optimizing A-site cation deficiency by setting x = 0.03 should enhance the ionic conductivity of the oxide. Although further increasing the A-site cation-deficiency slightly reduces oxygen permeability, the corresponding value is still comparable to that of BSCF [27] . This strongly suggests that the ionic conductivity of (BS) 0.80 CF is still sufficient to engage the entire cathodic surface in oxygen reduction. The oxygen permeation flux of (BS) 1.20 CF is 21.8% lower than that of BSCF at 700 \u00b0C under the identical operating conditions [55] , and this is attributed to the dramatic reduction in ionic conductivity from defect associations. Fleig [56] noted that if oxygen-ion diffusion in the cathode bulk is the rate-determining step, then the active zone is restricted to the 3PB, and the entire ionic current density is concentrated within a distance of only a few nanometers across the 2PB, between the MIEC and the electrolyte (as shown in Fig. 7 b). Oxygen reduction on the (BS) 1.20 CF cathode is likely constricted to the 3PB, and this increases the polarization resistance for the ion-transfer processes. Finally, the exchange current density, I 0 , which is a direct reflection of the electrocatalytic activity, is calculated from the charge-transfer resistance ( R E1 ) according to the Bulter\u2013Volmer equation as follows [57] : (5) I 0 = R T n F R E1 where n is the number of electrons that contribute to charge transfer reaction, R is the gas constant (8.3145 J mol \u22121 K \u22121 ), F is the Faraday constant (96485.3 C mol \u22121 ), and T is the absolute temperature (K). For oxygen reduction, n is assumed to be 4. The value of I 0 for (BS) 0.80 CF at 600 \u00b0C is 78.7(7) mA cm \u22122 , which is only about 18.2% of that for BSCF ( Table 5 ). These results indicate that impurities between the cathode and the electrolyte interface diminish the electrocatalytic activity and the electrical conductivity of A-site cation-deficient (BS) 1\u2212 x CF. The temperature dependence of the cathode polarization resistances ( R p ) for (BS) 1\u2212 x CF is shown in Fig. 8 . As expected, increasing the A-site cation deficiency increases both the area specific resistances (ASR) and the activation energies ( E a ) of the cathode. 3.6 Fuel cell performance The (BS) 0.97 CF material displays the most promise for application in SOFCs, because it demonstrated high electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity and low TEC relative to BSCF. We built whole SOFCs constructed with BSCF and (BS) 0.97 CF cathodes and thin-film SDC electrolyte. The performances of these cells were then measured in terms of their respective power and current densities using humidified H 2 (3 mol% H 2 O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant at temperatures between 550 and 650 \u00b0C; these results are presented in Fig. 9 . The cell equipped with the (BS) 0.97 CF cathode achieves peak power densities of 694 and 893 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. These values are slightly lower than those of the cell equipped with the BSCF cathode (728 and 989 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively). The total electrode polarization resistance, which is the sum of the anode and cathode values, was measured under OCV conditions. The electrode area-specific resistance is only 0.138 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C in the cell equipped with the (BS) 0.97 CF cathode, which is lower than the target value of 0.15 \u03a9 cm 2 proposed by Steele for solid-oxide fuel cells operating at reduced temperatures [58] . Unfortunately, the value is still somewhat higher than that of the cell equipped with the BSCF cathode (\u223c0.091 \u03a9 cm 2 ). Nevertheless, the introduction of A-site cation deficiency dramatically minimizes the TEC, and this is beneficial for the long-term stability of the fuel cell. The optimized A-site cation-deficient material, (BS) 0.97 CF, is a promising new cathode material for application in intermediate-temperature SOFCs. 4 Conclusions The extent of A-site cation deficiency has significant effects on both the physical-chemical properties and the electrochemical characteristics of (BS) 1\u2212 x CF oxides. Pure-phase perovskite with cubic symmetry is obtained for stoichiometric coefficients ( x ) of values less than 0.15. Increasing A-site cation deficiency decreases electrical conductivity due to the creation of additional oxygen vacancies. The increasing the A-site cation deficiency also causes impurities to form at the cathode/electrolyte interface, and these impurities steadily increase the cathode polarization resistance. The most significant advantage afforded by introducing A-site cation deficiency, however, is the reduction in the thermal expansion coefficient of the material. This effect presumably results from the temperature-induced reduction of the material's cobalt and iron ions from their +4 to their +3 oxidation states and from the suppression of cobalt ion spin-state transitions. The reduction in TEC renders the oxide more compatible with the electrolyte layer, and this is presumably beneficial for long-term stability of any fuel cells incorporating these materials. The SOFC constructed with a BS 0.97 CF cathode generates peak power densities of 694 and 893 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. These values are comparable to those obtained with a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode. In conclusion, slightly A-site cation-deficient (BS) 1\u2212 x CF is a promising cathode material for application in reduced temperature SOFCs.

The diffraction patterns of the composites were well indexed based on the physical mixture of the BSCF phase and the Co3O4 phase. A surprising increase in the total conductivity of the composites was observed even though Co3O4 is a p-type semiconductor with a low conductivity. Electrochemical impedance spectra of symmetric cells indicated that both the area specific resistance and the activation energy were reduced in samples with Co3O4 contents of 5-20 wt.% with minimum values reaching 10 wt.%. A synergistic effect likely occurred between BSCF and Co3O4 that led to the better performance.

BNF exists as a multiphase structure composed of a monoclinic phase and a cubic phase at room temperature, and then undergoes a phase transformation to a cubic structure starting at \u223c400\u00b0C, which is maintained at temperatures up to 900\u00b0C during a thermal cycle between room temperature and 900\u00b0C; while it retains the cubic perovskite lattice structure on cooling from 900\u00b0C to room temperature. Oxygen temperature-programmed desorption, combined thermal expansion and thermo-gravimetric analysis are used to clarify the thermal reducibility of BNF. A relatively good stability of BNF is demonstrated by electrical conductivity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The activity of BNF for oxygen reduction reaction is probed by symmetrical cell and single fuel cell tests.

        "abstract": "Inexpensive 20 wt.% Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts are synthesized by a glycine nitrate process (GNP) and an impregnation process (IMP). The catalytic activity for ethanol steam reforming (ESR) at 400\u2013650 \u00b0C, catalytic stability and carbon deposition properties are investigated. Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) shows a higher catalytic performance than Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), especially at lower temperatures. It also presents a better coking resistance and a lower graphitization degree of the deposited carbon. The superior catalytic activity and coke resistance of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) is attributed to the small particle size of the active metallic nickel phase and the strong interaction between the nickel and the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 support, as evidenced by the XRD and H 2 -TPR. The Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) is further applied as an anode functional layer in solid oxide fuel cells operating on ethanol steam. The cell yields a peak power density of 536 mW cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C when operating on EtOH\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures, which is only slightly lower than that of hydrogen fuel, whereas the cell without the functional layer failed for short-term operations.

Keywords Solid oxide fuel cells Nickel/ceria\u2013zirconia Ethanol steam reforming Carbon deposition Hydrogen production Catalyst layer 1 Introduction The expanding energy demands and shortage of petroleum reserves necessitate the development of alternative energy materials and technologies for a sustainable future. Fuel cells, electrochemical energy conversion devices that directly convert chemical energy into electric power with high efficiency and low emissions, have been proposed as a major energy source that may decrease the global reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse emissions. Ethanol is a good alternative renewable fuel, which can be obtained from biomass fermentation. Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) provides an environmentally friendly way to produce hydrogen for fuel cells [1,2] , which is a cleaner process than methane steam reforming that contributes little to the green house effect because CO 2 can be consumed during the biomass growth which was so-called \u201cCO 2 -free\u201d cycle. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are high-temperature fuel cells with fuel flexibility [3\u20137] . Recently, ethanol has attracted attention as a fuel for SOFCs. However, the direct operation of conventional SOFCs on ethanol could result in the quick degradation of cell performance due to the quick carbon build-up over the nickel cermet anode. The pre-reforming of ethanol to hydrogen is a method for SOFCs to operate on ethanol fuel without the need for cell improvement. However, the external reforming process increases the system complexity on the one hand and decreases the overall efficiency on the other hand. The internal reforming of ethanol is a more preferable way for operating on ethanol fuel. Unfortunately, the highly sintered nickel cermet anode shows poor catalytic activity for the ethanol reforming reaction and displays easy coke formation. Recently, it has been demonstrated by several authors that SOFCs can be operated on hydrocarbon fuels directly or through internal reforming by simply modifying the conventional anode with a thin layer of catalyst that has high activity towards the hydrocarbon reforming reactions. For example, Zhan and Barnett were the first to demonstrate Ru\u2013CeO 2 as such a catalyst [8] . The power output and anode coke resistance of fuel cells with a Ru\u2013CeO 2 functional layer were much improved, as compared to the conventional cells without a catalyst layer when operating on methane, propane or octane fuels [8\u201310] . Some supported group VIII metals, including Ni, Cu, Co, Rh, Ru, Pd and Pt, are known to be good catalysts for ESR [11\u201315] ; in particular, the supported noble metal catalysts have excellent catalytic activity. However, the high cost of those noble metals limits their large-scale application. The development of a less expensive catalytic system with high activity and stability will be an important aspect in making this technique economically competitive. As a low-cost and non-noble alternative, nickel-based catalysts have been widely used in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Nickel-based catalysts have superior ESR activity because of their high performance for C\u2013C rupture. Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , as the most effective catalysts, have been applied for reforming methane with carbon dioxide, but they suffer from carbon deposition, nickel sintering and phase transformation [16\u201318] . Coke deposition is the main cause for the deactivation of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts during ESR. The routes for carbon formation include the Boudouard reaction, methane decomposition and polymerization of ethene; the latter originated from ethanol dehydration over Al 2 O 3 acidic sites. The high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of CeO 2 improves catalytic performance by storing oxygen under an oxidative atmosphere and releasing it under a reductive atmosphere [19,20] . The superiority in its promotion for the water\u2013gas shift (WGS) reaction, thermal stability and oxygen storage capacity makes it a good additive in three-way catalyst (TWC) formulations [21] . According to the literature [22] , doping CeO 2 with suitable cations, such as Zr 4+ , Al 3+ and Si 4+ , can enhance the microstructural stability. Moreover, the characteristic feature of the valence shift between Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ allows it to easily obtain, release and transport oxygen in the CeO 2 -based materials and, consequently, induces a high OSC. It has also been reported that the addition of ZrO 2 to CeO 2 leads to an improvement in the OSC, redox properties, and thermal resistance of CeO 2 . In addition, this modification also increases the metal dispersion [20,23,24] . CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 was superior to Al 2 O 3 for the ESR reaction because it can restrict ethylene formation, and the optimum CeO 2 -to-ZrO 2 molar ratio in the Ce x Zr 1\u2212 x O 2 series was found to be approximately 4:1 for hydrogen production [25,26] . In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the glycine nitrate process is a facile way to develop nanosized Ce x Zr 1\u2212 x O 2 ( x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 or 0.8). The Pt\u2013Ce x Zr 1\u2212 x O 2 catalysts, prepared via incipient-to-wetness impregnation, showed high activity for ethanol steam reforming [27] . In this work, a less expensive Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalyst was synthesized for the application as an anode functional layer of SOFCs operating on ethanol fuel through internal reforming at intermediate temperatures. The effect of the synthesis method on the catalytic activity and carbon deposition properties of the catalyst for ESR was emphasized. The combustion synthesis proved to be highly promising. The combustion-synthesized Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalyst was finally applied as an anode functional layer in a real SOFC operating on ethanol steam fuel, and promising results were demonstrated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication Two different methods were used for the synthesis of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (20 wt.% Ni) catalyst powders. The first method was a solution combustion based on the glycine nitrite process (GNP) [28,29] . The second method was a conventional wet impregnation process (IMP); for a typical synthesis, approximately 2.0 g of the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 powder (prepared by the combustion synthesis) was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing a proper amount of nickel nitrate. The suspension was aged for 6 h at room temperature to guarantee the sufficient soaking of the solution into the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 powder. Then, it was dried at 100 \u00b0C and calcined at 700 \u00b0C in air for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the samples were ground by hand with the help of an agate mortar and pestle, pressed into disks and fragmented into pellets in 40\u201360 mesh for later catalytic tests. The fuel cell materials include a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) cathode, a (Y 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (YSZ) electrolyte, a Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 2 (SDC) interlayer and a NiO + YSZ anode (NiO:YSZ = 60:40, by weight). The BSCF was synthesized using an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process with metal nitrates (analytical reagents) applied as the raw materials [30] , while the NiO and YSZ used for the anode were commercial products (Chengdu Shudu Nano-science Co., Ltd. for NiO and Tosoh for YSZ). The disk-shaped anode substrates were first prepared using a tape-casting technique. The green anode pellets were fired at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to release the organic solvents and to create the proper mechanical strength for the substrate. The YSZ colloidal suspension was prepared by dispersing a fine YSZ powder into a solution of ethylene glycol (5 wt.% solid content) through high-energy ball milling (Fritsch, Pulverisette 6), which was then spray-deposited onto the anode substrates. The obtained green anode-electrolyte dual-layer half-cells were sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The SDC colloidal suspension was then spray-deposited onto the YSZ electrolyte, which was sintered at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The BSCF\u2013SDC composite cathode (70:30, by weight) was deposited on the SDC interlayer surface and fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. To prepare the catalyst layer, a slurry of the catalyst powder was prepared, which was screen-painted onto the outer surface of the anode layer and sintered at 700 \u00b0C for 1 h. 2.2 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic activity of the various catalysts was tested in a flow-through-type fixed-bed quartz-tube reactor with an inner diameter of approximately 8 mm. Approximately 0.2 g of catalyst particles in the size range of 40\u201360 mesh were placed in the middle of the reactor, and a K-type thermocouple was inserted into the center of the catalyst bed to detect the temperature of the reaction. The gas flow during the ethanol steam reforming reaction was controlled by an AFC 80MD digital mass flow controller (Qualiflow). Ethanol and water were metered and delivered to an evaporator at 180 \u00b0C to achieve complete gasification through the HPLC pumps. Then, ethanol, steam and the dilution gas were delivered to the reactor. The products were analyzed online by a Varian CP-3800 GC, which was equipped with a Hayesep Q, a Poraplot Q, a 5 \u00c5 sieve molecular capillary columns, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the separation and detection of H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 , and a flame ionization detector (FID) for the detection of the combustible substance. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were reduced in hydrogen at 650 \u00b0C for 1 h. The catalytic reaction was performed at 400\u2013650 \u00b0C. During the measurement, the liquid flow rate of ethanol and water was 0.05 ml min \u22121 (EtOH:H 2 O = 1:8, molar ratio), and helium was applied as a carrier gas at a fixed flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The conversion of ethanol ( X (%)) during the steam reforming was calculated according to Eq. (1) . The selectivity of H 2 ( S 1 (%)), CO ( S 2 (%)), CO 2 ( S 3 (%)) and CH 4 ( S 4 (%)) was calculated according to Eqs. (2)\u2013(5) , respectively: (1) X \u2009 ( % ) = F ethanol,in \u2212 F ethanol,out F ethanol,in \u00d7 100 (2) S 1 \u2009 ( % ) = [ H 2 ] [ H 2 ] + 2 [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 (3) S 2 \u2009 ( % ) = [ CO ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 (4) S 3 ( % ) = [ C O 2 ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 (5) S 4 ( % ) = [ C H 4 ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 2.3 Characterization The hydrogen-temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was used to identify the chemical interaction between NiO and the support. Approximately 0.03 g of catalyst particles were put in a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of approximately 3 mm. The sample was pretreated in argon at a flow rate of 30 ml min \u22121 [STP] at 400 \u00b0C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature in argon, the atmosphere was changed to 10 vol.% H 2 /Ar, and the reactor was programmed to heat to 930 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The hydrogen consumption was monitored by a BELCAT-A apparatus equipped with an in situ TCD detector. To evaluate the coke resistance of the various catalysts, approximately 0.2 g of the reduced catalyst particles were placed in a flow-through-type fixed-bed quartz-tube reactor and treated under EtOH:H 2 O = 1:8 with a liquid flow rate of 0.05 ml min \u22121 for 6 h at 500 \u00b0C and then cooled to room temperature in a helium atmosphere. After the treatment, approximately 0.05 g of powder was placed into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of approximately 3 mm. Pure oxygen (for the oxygen-temperature-programmed oxidization, O 2 -TPO) at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was then introduced to the top of the reactor. After flowing with the gas at room temperature for approximately 30 min to stabilize the baseline, the reactor was heated to 900 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The deposited carbon on the catalyst surface was gradually oxidized to CO 2 . The effluent gas from the reactor was connected to a mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden QIC-20) for in situ monitoring of CO 2 . In the NH 3 -TPD experiments, the samples were first treated in 10 vol.% H 2 \u2013Ar at 650 \u00b0C for 2 h, cooled to 100 \u00b0C, and exposed to 20 vol.% NH 3 (30 ml min \u22121 , He in balance) for 30 min. The sample was then purged with Ar at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h and heated at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 to 650 \u00b0C. The NH 3 concentration in the effluent gas was online monitored by a BELCAT-A apparatus equipped with an in situ TCD detector. The CO 2 -TPD process was performed to test the surface basicity of the catalysts. The samples were first reduced in hydrogen at 650 \u00b0C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature under the same atmosphere, and exposed to CO 2 (20 ml min \u22121 , STP) for 2 h. The treated samples were purged with Ar at room temperature for 1 h and heated at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 to 800 \u00b0C in Ar at 20 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The CO 2 signal was monitored and recorded continuously as a function of the temperature by MS. The phase structures of the various samples were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) equipped with a Cu K( radiation ( \u03bb = 0.1541 nm). The BET specific surface area of the catalysts was characterized by the N 2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using a surface area analyzer (BELSORP II, Japan). Prior to the nitrogen adsorption, the sample was degassed at 250 \u00b0C for 2.0 h to remove any physically adsorbed species. The surface area was determined from the linear portion of the BET equation. The SEM morphology of the calcined powder of the different catalysts was examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). The laser Raman spectra of the various catalysts after the treatment in EtOH:H 2 O = 1:8 atmosphere for 6 h at 500 \u00b0C was obtained in an HR800 UV Raman microspectrometer (JOBIN YVON, France) using the green line of an argon laser ( \u03bb = 514.53 nm) as the excitation source. The I \u2013 V polarization curves of the fuel cells measured at 550\u2013700 \u00b0C were obtained using a Keithley 2420 source meter in the 4-probe mode. During the measurements, hydrogen or EtOH\u2013H 2 O (2.3:1 molar ratio) gas mixtures were fed into the anode chamber and ambient air was used as the cathode atmosphere. The liquid ethanol\u2013water fuel was vaporized by a water bath (70 \u00b0C) and introduced into the anode chamber by nitrogen. The flow rate of hydrogen and nitrogen was kept at 60 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The electrode polarization resistance was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency of the EIS measurement ranged from 0.1 to 1000 kHz and the signal amplitude was 10 mV. The cross-sectional morphology of the fuel cell was examined by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-200). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Basic properties Fig. 1 shows the room-temperature XRD patterns of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts before and after the hydrogen reduction at 650 \u00b0C for 1 h. For comparison, the XRD pattern of the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 support is also presented. As shown in Fig. 1 , all the diffraction peaks of Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 can be indexed as a cubic fluorite structure, suggesting Zr 4+ was totally incorporated into the fluorite structure of CeO 2 with the formation of a solid solution, which agrees well with the literature results [31,32] . As shown in Fig. 1 a, very weak NiO peaks were detected in the XRD patterns of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst, suggesting the majority of the NiO in the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst most likely interacted strongly with the support. However, an appreciable amount of the NiO crystalline phase was observed in the IMP-prepared catalyst. The XRD patterns of the reduced Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts are depicted in Fig. 1 b. Diffraction peaks attributed to the Ni phase (44.5\u00b0 and 51.8\u00b0) were observed; however, compared to the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) showed much weaker and broader diffraction peaks of the metallic nickel phase, suggesting much smaller Ni particle sizes. The specific surface area was 32.8, 18.2 and 25.4 m 2 g \u22121 for Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 , NiO\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and NiO\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), respectively. The nickel oxide likely acted as a catalyst for the combustion reaction and resulted in the more sintered NiO\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP). The SEM morphology of the catalysts and the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 support are shown in Fig. 2 . Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 and NiO\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) exhibited porous, sponge-like structures. During the glycine combustion reaction, the emission of large volumes of gas products (N 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O) resulted in the fragile and porous structure of the solid product. However, for the NiO\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) catalyst, NiO was impregnated into the pores of the support, and consequently, the porosity was much reduced. The minor difference in the surface area of NiO\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) and the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 support implies the nickel oxide mainly occupied the macropores in the support. In addition to the surface area, the activity of nickel-based catalysts is also closely related to the interaction of the nickel with the support [33] . The chemical interaction between the nickel and the support was characterized by H 2 -TPR, and the profiles are shown in Fig. 3 . The peak temperature of free NiO during the H 2 -TPR process was reported to be around 330 \u00b0C [34] . With the increase in the chemical interaction between NiO and the support, a shift in the reduction peak to higher temperatures is expected. As can be seen, Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) demonstrated a weaker chemical interaction than Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) because the temperature of the main reduction peak was 367 \u00b0C, which was lower than 498 \u00b0C for Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP). There was a considerable amount of free NiO present in Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), while most of the NiO in the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst interacted with the Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 support, which agrees well with the XRD results. According to the H 2 -TPR results, the larger the particle sizes led to the easier reduction of the nickel oxide [35] . The interaction between NiO and the support strongly affected the Ni particle size, consequently, the catalytic activity. This interaction would prevent the mobility of the Ni 2+ on the support surface at higher temperatures. Thus, the metals that have strong interactions with the support typically should have a high resistance to be sintered and a higher dispersion. Another important factor in determining the catalytic activity of nickel is its crystalline size. The crystalline size of the metallic nickel in Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), as calculated from the XRD diffraction peak at 2 \u03b8 = 51.8\u00b0 using the Scherrer equation, was 8.7 nm and 26.5 nm, respectively. The difference in the crystalline size of the metallic nickel should be attributed to the different preparation methods. The strong interaction of the NiO species with the support phase, as evidenced by the H 2 -TPR and powder XRD, and higher metallic dispersion contributed greatly to the fine crystalline size of the nickel in the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst. The small Ni particle size would be beneficial for the suppression of carbon deposition over the catalyst during the ESR. 3.2 Catalytic performance The effect of the reaction temperature on the catalytic performance was investigated at a steam-to-carbon feed ratio (mol mol \u22121 ) of 4.0, atmospheric pressure and temperatures in the range of 400\u2013650 \u00b0C, the results of which are shown in Fig. 4 . Both catalysts showed good catalytic activity for the ESR; the complete ethanol conversion was achieved at a temperature as low as 400 \u00b0C. For the catalysts, the main products were H 2 , CO, CH 4 and CO 2 , while only minor amounts of byproducts, such as CH 3 CHO and CH 3 COCH 3 , were detected by applying the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) catalyst. Previous investigations of the reaction mechanism of the partial oxidation of ethanol or of ethanol steam reforming over M\u2013CeO 2 catalysts suggested that the ethoxy species probably acted as the reaction intermediate. In addition, the rate for the decomposition of the intermediate may be faster than that for the ethanol decomposition into acetaldehyde, as reported by Morgenstern and Fornango [36] . Increasing the reaction temperature led to a higher H 2 yield and selectivity but a lower methane selectivity. This result suggested that the steam reforming of methane, which is thermodynamically feasible, occurred as the major reaction. However, the CO selectivity decreased due to the intrinsically unfavorable effect of temperature on the WGS reaction. For instance, increasing the reaction temperature from 400 to 600 \u00b0C enhanced the hydrogen selectivity from 70.0% to 97.5% over Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and the CO selectivity from 4.7 to 30.0%. Both catalysts presented a high and comparable H 2 selectivity above 600 \u00b0C. However, a decrease in the operational temperature led to different activities. The H 2 selectivity of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) at 550 \u00b0C was 93.4% and 91.8%, respectively. There was an obvious diversity in the H 2 selectivity of the catalysts when the reaction temperature was reduced to below 450 \u00b0C. The H 2 selectivity of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) at 400 \u00b0C was 70.0% and 60.2%, respectively. The CH 4 selectivity over Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was lower than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). These results indicated that Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was more active than the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) catalyst for the methane steam reforming reaction at 400\u2013650 \u00b0C. 3.3 Catalytic stability and carbon deposition The stability of both catalysts for ESR was investigated at 500 \u00b0C using a liquid flow rate of ethanol\u2013water mixtures of 0.05 ml min \u22121 (EtOH:H 2 O = 1:8, molar ratio) and a flow rate of the diluting helium gas of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP], and the results are shown in Fig. 5 . During the test period of approximately 6 h, the ethanol conversion was maintained at 100% for both catalysts; however, the selectivity of the products showed substantially different changes. The Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was superior to Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) in hydrogen selectivity, agreeing well with our previous catalytic activity results. The methane selectivity of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was relatively lower than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). The Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst showed good stability for the selectivity of the products, while the product selectivity fluctuated with increasing the operation time of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) catalyst. The catalytic stability for ESR is closely related to coke formation over the catalyst. After the stability test, the catalyst was cooled down to room temperature in a helium flux and characterized by O 2 -TPO to analyze the carbon deposition properties. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding O 2 -TPO profiles of the catalysts after treatment in EtOH:H 2 O = 1:8 for 6 h. The CO 2 peak areas were calculated as 4.47 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 1.19 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), respectively. The CO 2 peak area reflects the amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts. These results suggested that the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) showed a much better coke resistance towards the ethanol steam reforming, which was in good agreement with the results of the Ni particle sizes evidenced by XRD and the methane selectivity in the catalytic activity test. To investigate the structures of the deposited carbon, laser Raman spectra of the two carbon-deposited catalysts were measured. As shown in Fig. 7 , the Raman spectra showed two intense bands: at 1350 cm \u22121 (usually called the D-band), which is associated with the disordered structure of carbon and one at 1580 cm \u22121 (usually called the G-band), which is assigned to the in-plane vibrations of the carbon atoms in hexagonal sheets [37] . The graphitization degree of the deposited carbon was related to the integrated intensity ratio in the form of R ( I D / I G ) [38] . According to the literature, the R -values should decrease with the increasing carbon graphitization degree [39] . The R -values of the deposited carbon over the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) were 1.59 and 1.36, respectively. This result implies the graphitization degree of the carbon deposited over Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) is much lower than that over Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). That is, the carbon deposited over the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) should be much easier to eliminate as compared to that deposited over the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). An acidic catalyst surface favors carbon deposition, whereas a basic one suppresses carbon deposition [40] . The NH 3 -TPD patterns of the various Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 8 . For both samples, the acidic sites are distributed in three desorption regions at 150\u2013250, 250\u2013400 and 400\u2013500 \u00b0C, which are labeled as \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 peaks and associated with weak, medium and strong acid sites, respectively. The \u03b1 peak was assigned to the physical adsorption of NH 3 or the interaction between NH 3 and the surface oxides or hydroxyl groups [41] . The \u03b2 peak should be attributed to the acidic hydroxyl group with weak acid sites [42] . The \u03b3 peak corresponded to the strong Lewis and/or Br\u00f6nsted acid sites [41] . All the tested samples showed similar acid site distributions, but different concentrations were observed. As can be seen, the intensity of the \u03b1 peak of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was relatively higher than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). The results suggested that Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) had more weak acid sites on the catalyst surface, which is helpful for the adsorption and activation of methane. The intensity of the \u03b2 peak of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was relatively lower than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), suggesting the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) presented more strong acid sites than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP). As can be seen, the intensity of the \u03b3 peak was almost the same for both catalysts. This result indicated that the number of strong Lewis and/or Br\u00f6nsted acid sites was comparable for both catalysts. The temperatures of the different peaks of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) were relatively lower than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). This suggested that the strength of the acidic sites of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was lower than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), which explained the better coke resistance of the GNP-prepared catalyst. To test the surface basicity of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalysts, the CO 2 -TPD analysis was performed. Fig. 9 shows the corresponding CO 2 -TPD profiles of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) catalysts. No absorption peak appeared above 700 \u00b0C, implying that no carbonate was formed in the CO 2 -TPD process. There were two peaks in the CO 2 -TPD profiles of both catalysts. The Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP) showed desorption peaks at 100 and 198 \u00b0C. Similar to Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) had one desorption peak near 100 \u00b0C with high peak intensity. The other peak with weak intensity appeared near 360 \u00b0C. However, the intensity of the two peaks of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) was higher than that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), suggesting that there are more weak and medium basic sites present in the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst. The CO 2 peak areas were 1.07 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 5.58 \u00d7 10 \u22128 for the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) and Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP), respectively. Thus, the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst had a higher surface basicity than the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). This result showed that the good coke resistance of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) should be attributable to the smaller crystalline size of nickel, the strong chemical interaction and the large surface basicity of the catalyst. 3.4 Performance in a single cell The Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst was also exploited as the anode functional layer in a real fuel cell. The catalyst layer was fabricated over the anode at 700 \u00b0C. Shown in Fig. 10 a and b are the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the fuel cells with the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst layer operating on hydrogen and EtOH\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures at different temperatures. When operating on the EtOH\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures, the peak power densities were 536, 334, 162 and 74 mW cm \u22122 at 700, 650, 600 and 550 \u00b0C, respectively, and they were 755, 488, 262 and 125 mW cm \u22122 when operating on hydrogen fuel. These results indicated that the power outputs of the cell operating on EtOH\u2013H 2 O are only slightly lower than that of hydrogen fuel. To properly determine the difference of the cell performances with hydrogen and EtOH\u2013H 2 O fuels, the cell impedance operated on the two fuels under OCV conditions was also measured, the results of which are shown in Fig. 10 c and d. At the same furnace temperature, the electrolyte resistance of the cell operating on EtOH-H 2 O seemed be higher than that of hydrogen. For example, it was 0.23 \u03a9 cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C when applying the hydrogen fuel and it was 0.26 \u03a9 cm \u22122 for EtOH\u2013H 2 O. This result suggested that the real cell temperature when applying the EtOH\u2013H 2 O fuel might be slightly lower than the furnace temperature. The ESR is endothermic in nature. Thus, the fuel cell temperature could be slightly lower than the set temperature; consequently, lower peak power densities were achieved. For comparison, the carbon deposition and cell performance of a cell with a conventional Ni\u2013YSZ anode was also investigated. After the treatment in the EtOH:H 2 O = 1:8 atmosphere for 6 h at 500 \u00b0C, the carbon-deposited catalyst was then conducted to the O 2 -TPO analysis. The CO 2 peak area was calculated as 3.32 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which was more than 75 times that of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP). Shown in Fig. 11 are the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the fuel cells without a catalyst layer operating on hydrogen and EtOH\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures at different temperatures. When operating on H 2 fuel, the PPDs were 735, 490, 275 and 140 mW cm \u22122 at 700, 650, 600 and 550 \u00b0C, respectively. The PPDs of the cell without a catalyst layer were similar to that of the cell with a catalyst layer. When operating on the EtOH\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures, the PPDs were 626 and 386 mW cm \u22122 at 700 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. When the furnace temperature decreased to 600 \u00b0C, the OCV and PPD were 0.837 V and 20 mW cm \u22122 , respectively. After the test, the cell was protected in hydrogen and cooled to room temperature. It was found that the cell was significantly destroyed by the deposited carbon that covered the entire anode surface. Those results suggested that the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst layer successfully protected the anode from serious carbon deposition under the operation on ethanol steam fuel [43] . The SEM image of the fresh fuel cell is shown in Fig. 12 . The catalyst layer adhered to the anode surface fairly well. The above results indicated that the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst can be ideally used as the catalyst layer of SOFCs operating on ethanol steam fuel. 4 Conclusions The combustion-synthesized Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 catalyst had good catalytic activity for ESR between 400 and 650 \u00b0C, and it was superior to a similar catalyst prepared by IMP. The strong interaction between NiO and the support accounted for the high activity of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) catalyst. Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) also had a better initial stability at 500 \u00b0C and a much better coking resistance than Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). The strong interaction between NiO and Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 , the smaller nickel particle size and the relatively lower methane selectivity in the products should account for the better coking resistance of the Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) over Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) also showed a lower graphitization degree of the deposited carbon than Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (IMP). The excellent catalytic activity of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP) for ethanol conversion to hydrogen resulted in the high cell performance of the fuel cell with this catalyst as the anode catalyst layer operating on EtOH\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures. The low price of Ni\u2013Ce 0.8 Zr 0.2 O 2 (GNP), its good catalytic activity and stability and high coking resistance demonstrate high promise for its application as the catalyst layer in solid oxide fuel cells operating on ethanol steam fuel.

        "abstract": "An inexpensive 7 wt.% Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 composite is synthesized by a glycine\u2013nitrate process and systematically investigated as anode catalyst layer of solid-oxide fuel cells operating on methane fuel by examining its catalytic activity towards methane partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming at 600\u2013850 \u00b0C, cell performance, mechanical performance, and carbon deposition properties. Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 shows comparable catalytic activities to Ru\u2013CeO 2 for the above three reactions. The cell with a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer delivers maximum peak power densities of 494 and 532 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C, operating on methane\u2013H 2 O and methane\u2013CO 2 mixture gases, respectively, which are comparable to those operating on hydrogen. Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 is found to have better mechanical performance than Ru\u2013CeO 2 . O 2 -TPO demonstrates that Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 does not inhibit the carbon formation under pure methane atmosphere, while the introduction of steam or CO 2 can effectively suppress coke formation. However, due to the low nickel content in the catalyst layer, the coke formation over the catalyst layer is actually not serious under real cell operation conditions. More importantly, Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 effectively protects the anode layer by greatly suppressing carbon formation over the anode layer, especially near the anode\u2013electrolyte interface. Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 is highly promising as an anode functional layer for solid-oxide fuel cells. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Nickel\u2013alumina Catalyst layer Methane Carbon deposition 1 Introduction Recently, there has been tremendous interest in fuel cells as electrical power generators because of their high energy-conversion efficiency, low emissions, and size flexibility, with capacities ranging from several milliwatts to the megawatts level [1\u20133] . Among the many types of fuel cells, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have attracted particular attention because of their fuel flexibility [4,5] . Besides hydrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ammonia, alcohols, and solid carbon can all be used as potential fuels [6\u201312] . This feature is very attractive for near-future applications since the public infrastructure for hydrogen production, storage and transportation is still far from mature, while hydrocarbons are currently widely available. Actually, hydrogen is presently produced mainly by steam reforming of hydrocarbons. When hydrocarbons are adopted as the fuels for SOFCs, they are typically first externally reformed to CO + H 2 before being introduced into the fuel cell reactor [13,14] . The external reforming process, however, not only reduces the overall energy-conversion efficiency, but also produces additional greenhouse gases. Because of this, direct hydrocarbon-fueled SOFCs have been gaining more and more attention recently [15\u201318] . As the simplest hydrocarbon, methane is the main component in the huge reserves of natural gas and coal-bed gas, and also the renewable resource of biogas. In principle, the simplest way to operate an SOFC on methane fuel is direct electro-catalytic oxidation of methane over the anode. However, the state-of-the-art sintered nickel-cermet anode catalyzes the CH 4 decomposition reaction that easily causes coke formation over the nickel catalyst surface and consequently, fast deterioration of the cell performance [19,20] . The development of novel anode materials with high coking-resistant capabilities has been extensively explored. Among them, CeO 2 \u2013Cu cermet anodes and perovskite-type La 1\u2212 x Sr x Cr 1\u2212 y Mn y O 3 oxide anodes have shown high resistance towards coke formation [21\u201324] . However, such anodes always show poor electrochemical activity for methane oxidation and consequently, poor cell performance was obtained [21\u201324] . Development of new anode materials with high electro-catalytic activity for methane oxidation but not for the methane cracking reaction is the key to realizing direct-methane SOFCs. An alternative way to operate on methane fuel is to integrate the catalytic conversion of methane to syngas reaction (i.e., partial oxidation, steam reforming or CO 2 reforming) with SOFCs internally [25\u201329] . Since CO and H 2 have much higher electrochemical activity than methane, such an operating mode can effectively improve the cell performance when using methane fuel. Furthermore, it can also effectively suppress carbon deposition over the anode surface. However, the traditional Ni-cermet anodes usually show poor catalytic activity towards the above reactions, especially at reduced temperatures. Very recently, the deposition of a highly active catalyst layer over the anode surface was found to be an effective way of increasing the cell performance when operating on hydrocarbon fuels [30\u201333] . It not only increases the cell power output, but also obviously suppresses the coke formation over the anode surface. In particular, Ru\u2013CeO 2 has been found to be an efficient catalyst for operating on methane, propane and butane fuels, in both single-chamber and dual-chamber cell configurations [30,32\u201336] . However, the high price of Ru\u2013CeO 2 is the main obstacle towards its large-scale application. The development of cheap and highly active materials for the functional layer is then critical. In our previous communication, we demonstrated that an inexpensive Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst also had very high catalytic activity towards methane partial oxidation, methane steam reforming and methane CO 2 reforming reactions at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C [31] . The cell with the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer showed significant improvement in cell performance, operating on both pure methane and methane\u2013oxygen mixtures of gases. Furthermore, the cell performance deterioration rate was also greatly reduced even when operating on pure methane fuel. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 as the catalyst layer of SOFC anode operating on methane\u2013oxygen, methane\u2013H 2 O, and methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures. The following characterizations were investigated: catalytic activity for syngas production from methane\u2013oxygen, methane\u2013CO 2 and methane\u2013H 2 O mixture gases, cell performance, mechanical performance of the catalyst layer under repeated thermal and redox cycling, and coke deposition properties. A comparative study with Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst was also conducted. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst powder synthesis and cell fabrication Both 7 wt.% Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 and 7 wt.% Ru\u2013CeO 2 powders, investigated as the materials for the catalyst layer, were synthesized by a glycine nitrite process (GNP) [37] . Taking the synthesis of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 as an example, stoichiometric amounts of nickel nitrate and alumina nitrate were first dissolved in de-ionized water, glycine was then added at a molar ratio of 2.0 between the glycine and total metallic cations. The water in the solution was then evaporated by heating over a hot plate under stirring to create a liquid precursor, which was then moved to an electrical oven at 240 \u00b0C to induce auto-combustion. The primary powder was further calcined at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h in static air. The fuel cell materials, including the cathode La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) and the electrolyte (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ), were prepared by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process [38,39] . The fuel cell adopted in this study was a 60 wt.% NiO + 40 wt.% ScSZ anode-supported thin-film ScSZ electrolyte fuel cell (\u223c20 \u03bcm), fabricated by a dual dry-pressing/sintering process [39] . Ni\u2013ScSZ anode powder was first pressed into a substrate disk using a stainless steel die under a pressure of 120 MPa. ScSZ powder was distributed over the anode surface homogenously and followed by a second press under a pressure of 240 MPa to form the green dual layer cell, which was then sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h to densify the electrolyte layer. The sintered cells had a diameter of \u223c13 mm and a thickness of \u223c0.3 mm. 2.2 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic activity of the catalysts and anode material was studied in a flow-through type fixed-bed quartz-tube reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c8 mm. About 0.2 g of catalyst particles in the size range of 60\u201380 mesh was dropped into the middle of the reactor. The gas flow for partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming reactions were precisely controlled by AFC 80MD digital mass flow controllers (Qualiflow). The gas mixtures were introduced from the top of the reactor, and the effluent gases from the bottom of the reactor were introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with Hayesep Q, Poraplot Q and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve capillary columns for the separation of H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 . Helium was used as the carrier gas. Typically, the methane flow rate was kept at 10 ml min \u22121 [STP] and the diluting helium gas at 80 ml min \u22121 [STP]. 2.3 Characterization techniques The phase structure of synthesized powders was characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, ARL X\u2019 TRA) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.1541 nm). The cross-sectional morphologies of the fuel cells were examined using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000) equipped with an EDX detector (QUANTA-200,132-10). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was performed to identify the interaction between NiO and the support. Approximately 0.03 g of oxide powder was placed in a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm. The sample was pretreated under a pure argon atmosphere at the flow rate of 30 ml min \u22121 for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the atmosphere was switched to 10 vol.% H 2 /Ar, and the reactor was programmatically heated to 930 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The consumption of hydrogen was monitored by an in situ thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector using a BELCAT-A apparatus. For the carbon deposition tests, about 0.2 g samples were first placed in a flow-through type quartz-tube reactor and treated at high temperature (typically 850 \u00b0C) under a methane-containing atmosphere at the flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 for 5 min. The catalysts were then cooled to room temperature under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon). After the treatment, approximately 0.05 g of powder was placed into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm. Pure oxygen (for oxygen temperature-programmed oxidization, O 2 -TPO) at the flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was then introduced from the top of the reactor. After flowing with the gas at room temperature for \u223c30 min, the reactor was programmatically heated to 800 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The deposited solid carbon over the catalyst surface was progressively oxidized into gaseous CO 2 . The effluent gas from the reactor was connected with a Hiden QIC-20 Mass spectroscope (MS) for in situ monitoring of concentration variation of the CO 2 . The I \u2013 V polarization of the cells was measured at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C using a Keithley 2420 source meter in 4-probe mode. During the measurement, methane fuel or a mixture of CH 4 \u2013O 2 , CH 4 \u2013CO 2 or CH 4 \u2013H 2 O was fed into the anode chamber at a flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP] while ambient air was provided as the oxidant gas at in the cathode chamber. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic activity Presently, there is considerable interest in reducing the traditional 1000 \u00b0C operating temperature of SOFCs to the intermediate-temperature range of 600\u2013850 \u00b0C because of the many benefits associated with such a reduction [40] . When the fuel cell is integrated with the methane internal reforming or partial oxidation reactions, it places much stricter requirement on the catalyst layer. Our primary investigations demonstrated that Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst possessed very high activity for methane partial oxidation (Eq. (1) ), methane steam reforming (Eq. (2) ), and methane CO 2 reforming (Eq. (3) ) between 750 and 850 \u00b0C [31] . (1) CH 4 + 1/2O 2 = CO + 2H 2 (2) CH 4 + H 2 O = CO + 3H 2 (3) CH 4 + CO 2 = 2CO + 2H 2 The catalytic activity of the combustion-synthesized Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 for the above three reactions was further comparatively studied with combustion-synthesized 7 wt.% Ru\u2013CeO 2 and Ni\u2013ScSZ anode material over the intermediate-temperature range 600\u2013850 \u00b0C. During the fuel cell fabrication, the catalyst layer was fired onto the anode surface at 850 \u00b0C while the Ni\u2013ScSZ anode was sintered at 1500 \u00b0C, together with the electrolyte layer. The Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , Ru\u2013CeO 2 and Ni\u2013ScSZ catalysts were calcined at 850, 850 and 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the oxygen conversion, methane conversion and CO selectivity over Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , Ru\u2013CeO 2 and Ni\u2013ScSZ catalysts for the above three reactions at the methane to oxygen/H 2 O/CO 2 ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:1, respectively. Over the whole investigated temperature range from 600 to 850 \u00b0C, Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 showed similar catalytic activity to Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst, but was considerably higher than that of Ni\u2013ScSZ, for all three above reactions. When operating on methane\u2013oxygen gas mixtures, 100% oxygen conversion was achieved for both Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalysts over the entire temperature range under investigation, while oxygen conversion was only 48.6% for the Ni\u2013ScSZ catalyst ( Fig. 1 a), even at 700 \u00b0C. At 600 \u00b0C, the CH 4 conversion reached 73.1, 80.0, and 71.3% for reactions (1)\u2013(3) , respectively, when using the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst. They were 0.0, 3.9, and 5.4% for the Ni\u2013ScSZ catalyst. The above results further suggest Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 as the catalyst layer of choice for IT-SOFCs from the aspect of catalytic activity for methane conversion to syngas. It is well known that the activity of nickel-based catalysts for methane partial oxidation is closely related with the interaction of the nickel with the support [41] . Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , Ni\u2013ScSZ and Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalysts before and after the hydrogen reduction. Before the reduction, both Ni\u2013ScSZ and Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalysts displayed a physical mixture of their respective components (NiO and ScSZ for NiO\u2013ScSZ, and RuO 2 and CeO 2 for RuO 2 \u2013CeO 2 ), while the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was composed of a spinel-type phase and \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 with no NiO detected. This suggests NiO and \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 reacted to form a new NiAl 2 O 4 spinel in the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Fig. 3 shows the H 2 -TPR of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013ScSZ catalysts. It has been reported that the reduction temperature of NiO in H 2 was about 330 \u00b0C for free NiO or NiO species with very weak interactions with the support phase [42] . Only one reduction peak at around 830 \u00b0C was observed for the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which was attributed to the reduction of NiAl 2 O 4 spinel to metallic nickel and Al 2 O 3 . It is interesting that strong and complicated interactions also existed between NiO and ScSZ based on the H 2 -TPR results. The H 2 -TPR profile of NiO\u2013ScSZ can be divided into six overlapped reduction peaks with peak temperatures of 510, 563, 663, 710, 770 and 841 \u00b0C. Therefore, at least six different types of interactions, with different strengths, existed between the NiO and ScSZ phases. Such interactions are unlikely from the formation of new solid solutions, since the XRD patterns of the composite just displayed a physical mixture of NiO and ScSZ phases. Another important factor in determining the catalytic activity of nickel is its crystalline size. The crystalline size of the metallic nickel in Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013ScSZ was 6.7 and 25.7 nm, respectively, calculated from the XRD diffraction peak at 2 \u03b8 = 51.8\u00b0 using the Scherrer equation. The strong interaction of NiO species with the support phase, as evidenced by the H 2 -TPR and powder XRD, and relatively low calcination temperature contributed much to the fine crystalline size of the nickel in Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, while the large grain size of the nickel in Ni\u2013ScSZ was due to the ultra-high sintering temperature (1500 \u00b0C). The relatively poor activity of Ni\u2013ScSZ for methane conversion was likely associated with the large crystalline size from the ultra-high temperature sintering. It has been reported that metallic nickel also has a certain type of interaction with Al 2 O 3 support, which can suppress the crystalline growth and ensure long-term operational stability [43] . The operational stability of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was selectively investigated for methane partial oxidation at a methane to oxygen ratio of 4:1, which has turned out to be the optimal ratio to achieve the maximum power output for the SOFC when operating on methane\u2013oxygen mixture gases [31] . As shown in Fig. 4 , during the 90 h of operation, the methane conversion and CO selectivity was fairly stable, suggesting the catalyst indeed has good resistance to sintering. 3.2 Cell performance Previously, we reported that the cell performance was obviously improved by adopting Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 as an anode functional layer when operating both on pure methane and methane\u2013oxygen gas mixtures [31] . The improved cell performance is due to the increased catalytic activity of the anode towards methane partial oxidation, which results in an increased hydrogen concentration in the anode atmosphere. The much higher catalytic activity of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 for methane steam reforming and CO 2 reforming than the Ni\u2013ScSZ anode suggests the cell performance should also be improved when operating on methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures by adopting a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 anode catalyst layer. In other words, Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 should also be an ideal catalyst for internal reforming of methane fuel too. The cell performance while operating on methane\u2013steam gas mixtures and methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures gases with CH 4 to H 2 O and CH 4 to CO 2 ratios of 2:1 were then tested. Shown in Fig. 5 are the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the fuel cells without and with the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer at different temperatures. When no catalyst layer was deposited over the anode, the cell delivered peak power densities of 324, 254, 207, 116 and 103 mW cm \u22122 at 850, 825, 800, 775 and 750 \u00b0C, operating on methane-steam gas mixtures respectively, while they increased to 494, 427, 365, 320, and 282 mW cm \u22122 when a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was applied. Similarly, they were 175 mW cm \u22122 (850 \u00b0C), 139 mW cm \u22122 (825 \u00b0C), 115 mW cm \u22122 (800 \u00b0C), 82 mW cm \u22122 (775 \u00b0C) and 60 mW cm \u22122 (750 \u00b0C) when operating on methane\u2013CO 2 mixture, and they increased to 532, 406, 370, 318 and 259 mW cm \u22122 for the cell with the catalyst layer. Table 1 lists the peak power densities (PPDs) at 850 \u00b0C of the fuel cells with and without the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 anode catalyst layer operating on methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures at various methane to steam/CO 2 ratios. For completeness, the cell performance operating on methane\u2013oxygen gas mixtures is also presented [31] . It was found that the PPDs of the cells operating on all three gas mixtures first increased with the increase of methane to oxygen/steam/CO 2 ratios, and then decreased. At all ratios, the cell with the catalyst layer had higher PPDs than those of the cells with a bare Ni\u2013ScSZ anode. The maximum PPDs for the cell with the catalyst layer were 456, 494 and 532 mW cm \u22122 , when operating on methane\u2013oxygen, methane\u2013H 2 O and methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures, respectively, which were reached at methane to oxygen/H 2 O/CO 2 ratios of 4:1, 2:1 and 2:1, respectively. For the cell without the anode catalyst layer, the maximum PPDs were 242, 324 and 262 mW cm \u22122 for methane\u2013oxygen, methane\u2013H 2 O and methane\u2013CO 2 , respectively, which were reached at methane to oxygen/H 2 O/CO 2 ratios of 8:1, 2:1 and 4:1, respectively. In a previous study, Jiang and Virkar demonstrated that the performance of SOFC operating on H 2 and CO gas mixtures was very high [44] . For a fuel gas containing greater than 50% H 2 (and balanced by CO), it was argued that H 2 O produced by the electrochemical oxidation of H 2 was more than sufficient to react with CO present to form H 2 and CO 2 . In such a case, there should be little difference in performance when compared to pure H 2 as fuel. The above observations can well explain the small differences in maximum PPD obtained for the fuel cell with the catalyst layer when operating on methane\u2013oxygen, methane\u2013H 2 O and methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures in this study, as demonstrated in Table 1 . Since methane has a much slower electrochemical oxidation rate than H 2 over nickel anodes, the maximum PPDs should be reached at the condition where methane was totally converted by the catalytic reaction to form H 2 and CO. Assuming free gas diffusion inside the anode layer, the maximum PPDs should be reached at the condition of 100% methane conversion, i.e., it should be reached at methane to oxygen, methane to H 2 O and methane to CO 2 ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:1, respectively, when operating on methane and oxygen/steam/CO 2 gas mixtures. The higher-than-expected experimental ratios needed to obtain the maximum PPDs could be explained by the diffusion blocking effect of the catalyst layer [31] , which resulted in the actual methane concentration within the anode layer being lower than that in the feed gas and made the gas ratio needed to shift to the higher ratio to obtain the maximum PPDs. For a cell without the catalyst layer, a too-low methane to O 2 /H 2 O/CO 2 ratio would result in high concentrations of unconverted O 2 , H 2 O, CO 2 and methane due to the poor catalytic activity of the anode, which then diluted the H 2 /CO fuels and resulted in a lowered H 2 /CO concentration. A too-high methane to O 2 /H 2 O/CO 2 ratio would also result in lowered H 2 and CO concentrations due to insufficient H 2 /CO production. The maximum PPD was reached at the highest H 2 and CO concentration in the reforming gas, which was achieved at methane to O 2 /H 2 O/CO 2 ratios of 8:1, 2:1 and 4:1 when operating on methane\u2013O 2 , methane\u2013H 2 O and methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures, respectively, for the cell with a bare Ni\u2013ScSZ anode, in this study. 3.3 Mechanical properties In practical applications, fuel cells may experience repeated thermal and redox cycling, especially in portable application. The firm adhesion of the catalyst layer to the anode surface is critical for stable cell performance. The mechanical performance of the catalyst layer over the anode surface during the repeated redox cycling was investigated by H 2 reduction and O 2 oxidation at 850 \u00b0C for 20 cycles, while the thermal cycling stability of the catalyst layer was examined by repeated fast heating to 850 \u00b0C and then quenching to room temperature in air for 20 cycles. For comparison, the typical Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst was also investigated in a similar way. Shown in Fig. 6 are the SEM images of the cells after the thermal cycling and redox cycling in cross-sectional view. When the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 was adopted as the catalyst layer, it still adhered to the anode surface very well after both the fast thermal cycling test and the redox cycling test. No delamination of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer from the anode surface was observed by SEM over the entire cell. However, when Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst was adopted as the catalyst layer, as shown in Fig. 6 b and d, some cracks were formed between the catalyst and anode interface after both the thermal and redox cycling. The separation of the catalyst layer from the anode surface would eventually make the catalyst layer lose its functionality. This result suggests that Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 is superior to Ru\u2013CeO 2 in applications where repeated thermal cycling and redox cycling could be occurring, such as portable applications and single-chamber fuel cells application. 3.4 Carbon deposition Rapid deterioration of the fuel cell performance was frequently observed with the nickel anode when operating on methane fuel, due to the coke formation over the anode surface that limits free gas adsorption and electrochemical oxidation of the fuel. Previously, we demonstrated that the cell stability was greatly improved by adopting a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer over the anode surface. It is well known that nickel-based catalysts catalyze carbon deposition. Acidic support also promotes such carbon formation [45] . The carbon deposition behavior of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was investigated by first treating it in pure methane at various temperatures at the flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 for 5 min, then protecting it with an inert gas at the flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 to room temperature, and finally conducting the temperature-programmed oxidation reaction. For comparison, the carbon deposition behavior of Ru\u2013CeO 2 and Ni\u2013ScSZ anode were also investigated. Shown in Fig. 7 are the corresponding O 2 -TPO profiles of the catalysts during the O 2 -TPO process after treatment in pure methane for 5 min between 750 and 850 \u00b0C. The amount of active metal was \u223c3.5 mg for all three catalysts. It clearly shows that the Ru\u2013CeO 2 had much superior coke resistance than the other two catalysts at all investigated temperatures. This is in good agreement with the literature results showing that Ru does not catalyze the methane cracking reaction. After treatment at 850 \u00b0C for 5 min, the absolute amount of coke formed over the Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst was only about 6.34% of that over the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, or 4.17% of that over the Ni\u2013ScSZ catalyst. These results suggest that Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 did not show an improvement in resistance towards coke formation as compared to Ni\u2013ScSZ. Shown in Fig. 8 are the O 2 -TPO profiles of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst after treatment in methane\u2013CO 2 and methane\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures at various ratios at 850 \u00b0C for a fixed time of 5 min. Methane was kept at 40 ml min \u22121 . It clearly demonstrates that the coke formation was greatly suppressed by introducing CO 2 or H 2 O into the methane fuel. The higher the CO 2 /H 2 O to methane ratio, the less coke was formed. At a CH 4 to H 2 O/CO 2 ratio of 2:1, negligible amounts of coke were formed over the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, as evidenced by CO 2 -TPD. It is interesting that the methane to CO 2 /H 2 O ratio of 2:1 also resulted in the maximum cell performance when operating on methane\u2013CO 2 and methane\u2013H 2 O gas mixtures. The suppression of coke formation by introducing CO 2 and H 2 O can be explained by the following carbon elimination reactions: (4) C + CO 2 = 2CO (5) C + H 2 O = CO + H 2 , The above results suggest that Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 is more promising as an internal reforming catalyst for operating on methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures than on pure methane fuel. In our previous study we demonstrated that the cell operational stability was obviously improved by adopting the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer, even with pure methane as the fuel [31] . For example, the performance deterioration was about 43% after 90 min of operation with pure methane fuel at 850 \u00b0C for the cell with a bare Ni\u2013ScSZ anode, while it was only 4% after 150 min of operation for a similar cell with a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer. To interpret such an improvement, a cell with the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer and a cell with a bare Ni\u2013ScSZ anode were exposed to pure methane under open circuit voltage (OCV) condition at 850 \u00b0C for 10 min and then protected by an inert gas while cooling to room temperature in order to detect any morphological changes. It was observed by the unaided eye that the cell with the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer still retained perfect cell integrity. As for the cell with the bare nickel\u2013ScSZ anode, it was distorted in some local regions and serious cracks had formed over the electrolyte surface, as shown in Fig. 9 . Carbon deposition over the anode was investigated by EDX at selected regions as shown in Fig. 10 , i.e., within the ScSZ electrolyte (region 1), within the anode layer near the anode\u2013electrolyte interface (region 2, about 20 \u03bcm from the anode\u2013electrolyte interface), within the anode layer near the catalyst layer (region 3, about 20 \u03bcm from the catalyst\u2013anode interface), and within the catalyst layer (region 4). For comparison, similar regions for a cell without the catalyst layer were also observed, named 1\u2032, 2\u2032, and 3\u2032, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10 e, f and g, a carbon peak of high intensity was detected at anode region 3\u2032 for the cell without the catalyst layer. Even for region 2\u2032 near the electrolyte\u2013anode interface, a high carbon peak height was detected. For the cell with the catalyst layer, shown in Fig. 10 a\u2013d, the intensity of the carbon peak near the anode\u2013electrolyte interface (region 2) was much smaller as compared to the similar region (2\u2032) for the cell without the catalyst layer. The samples for EDX examination were typically easily contaminated with carbon. In order to quantitatively analyze the carbon deposition from methane decomposition, carbon information over the freshly crashed ScSZ electrolyte was also obtained by EDX. Because of the dense electrolyte layer, there should be no carbon deposited over the cross-sectional region of the electrolyte from the methane decomposition. All the carbon detected by EDX over the electrolyte layer would then be contributed by contamination during the sample preparation for EDX measurement. Assuming the homogeneous distribution of the contaminated carbon over the whole sample prepared for EDX measurement, the amount of carbon deposited over the anode that was contributed by the methane thermal decomposition can be obtained by subtracting the contaminated carbon. At regions 2 and 3 for the cell with the catalyst layer, the actual carbon deposited was found to be 13.1 \u00b1 0.2 and 22.4 \u00b1 0.2 wt.%, respectively. Correspondingly, it was 24.9 \u00b1 0.1 and 30.2 \u00b1 0.1 wt.%, for the regions 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 for the cell without the catalyst layer. This clearly suggests that the catalyst layer protected the anode from carbon deposition, especially for the anode region near the anode\u2013electrolyte interface. It is well known that the electro-active zone of the anode is less than 20 \u03bcm nearest to the electrolyte layer at the anode\u2013electrolyte interface [46] . Carbon deposition over this layer would result in reduced active sites for electrochemical oxidation of the fuel, and then serious deterioration of the cell performance, which may explain the quick deterioration of cell performance for the cell without the catalyst layer when operating on pure methane fuel, as observed in our previous study [31] . The carbon deposition over the anode region near the anode\u2013electrolyte interface would also introduce large internal stress, which may explain the crack formation over the thin-film electrolyte. It is interesting that only a small amount of carbon was deposited inside the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer, which can be explained by the fact that the absolute amount of nickel catalyst in the catalyst layer was very small; the nickel weight percentage in the catalyst layer was only 7 wt.%, while it was about 54 wt.% nickel in the anode. 4 Conclusions The 7 wt.% Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst had excellent catalytic activity, comparable to that of Ru\u2013CeO 2 for methane partial oxidation, methane steam reforming and methane CO 2 reforming reactions between 600 and 850 \u00b0C. The strong interaction between nickel oxide and the Al 2 O 3 support and the small crystalline size of the nickel accounted for the high activity of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst for such reactions. The excellent catalytic activity of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 towards methane steam reforming and methane CO 2 reforming resulted in high cell performance when a fuel cell anode with a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 functional layer was operated on methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures. Because of its much better mechanical performance, Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 was superior to Ru\u2013CeO 2 from the aspect of cell integrity for the applications where repeated thermal cycling or redox cycling are needed, for example, in single-chamber operation mode. As compared to Ru\u2013CeO 2 , Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 did not suppress coke formation, however, the introduction of CO 2 and H 2 O in methane reduced the coke formation rate considerably. In a real fuel cell, the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer effectively protected the anode from coke formation, especially for the region near to the anode\u2013electrolyte interface, where the electrochemically active sites are mainly located. This is the reason for the improved cell performance when operating on methane fuel when a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 anode catalyst was adopted, as demonstrated in our previous study [31] . The much cheaper price of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 over Ru\u2013CeO 2 , its excellent catalytic properties and mechanical performance, and its effectiveness in preventing coke formation over the anode layer are promising for its adoption as the anode catalyst layer in solid-oxide fuel cells operating on methane fuel.

        "abstract": "High-temperature proton conductors are promising electrolytes for protonic solid oxide fuel cells (H + -SOFCs). In this study, the relationship between the Zr doping content and structure, chemical stability, carbon dioxide resistivity, sinterability and electrochemical properties of BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BZCY y ), 0.0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.8, are studied systemically using XRD, CO 2 -TPD, SEM, EIS and I \u2013 V polarization characterizations. Zr doping suppresses carbonate formation, CO 2 -TPD demonstrates that the formative rate of carbonate over BZCY y are 7.50 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 8.70 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 at y = 0.0 and 0.4, respectively. Investigation of sinterability shows that the anode-supported configuration helps the sintering of the thin-film electrolyte. Peak power densities of 220 and 84 mW cm \u22122 are obtained at 750 and 450 \u00b0C, respectively, with BZCY0.4 electrolyte. Due to the favorable chemical stability against CO 2 and good sintering in the thin-film configuration, BZCY0.4 is a potential electrolyte material for H + -SOFCs. Keywords Proton BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 CO 2 -TPD Solid oxide fuel cells 1 Introduction During the past decades, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have gained considerable attention as advanced power generation devices because of their high-energy conversion efficiency, low environmental impact and good fuel flexibility [1\u20133] . Traditional SOFCs are composed of yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolytes and operate at approximately 1000 \u00b0C. Although such a high operating temperature is beneficial for promoting the electrode reactions and ensures sufficient ionic mobility inside the electrolyte, it also introduces a series of problems such as fast sintering of electrodes, high reactivity between cell components and expensive interconnecting materials. Consequently, there is increasing interest in reducing the operating temperature of SOFCs to the intermediate-temperature range, i.e. 400\u2013800 \u00b0C [4\u20137] , thereby allowing a more flexible choice of cell materials and prolonging the lifetime of the device. Up to now, the most applied SOFC electrolytes have been oxygen-ionic conducting oxides including yttria or scandia stabilized zirconia, or gadolinia or samaria doped ceria. Due to the large size of the ion, the activation energy ( E a ) for oxygen ion diffusion reaches approximately 0.8 eV [8,9] . Consequently, a quick drop in ionic conductivity with reducing operating temperature is normally observed for many O 2\u2212 conductors. Iwahara et al. first demonstrated that some perovskite-type oxides exhibited proton conduction at elevated temperatures under a humidified atmosphere [10,11] . A proton moves much more easily than an oxygen ion because of its much smaller ionic size, consequently a lower E a of 0.3\u20130.6 eV is typically observed [9,12] . Thereby, proton-conducting oxides are superior to oxygen-ion conducting oxides for reduced temperature operation. Today, there is a tremendous interest in the research and application of proton-conducting oxides for use as electrolytes for fuel cells and electrolyzers [13\u201315] . At present, high-temperature proton conductors are reported for several perovskite-structure oxides, such as doped BaCeO 3 , SrCeO 3 , BaZrO 3 and SrZrO 3 [16] . Although some discrepancies still existed in the literatures, yttrium-doped BaCeO 3 ceramics are generally believed to possess the highest protonic conductance when compared to the others and may even exceed that of the well-known high oxygen-ionic conducting oxides of doped ceria at temperatures lower than 600 \u00b0C [17] , making them highly promising as electrolytes of IT-SOFCs. However, such materials were found to be unstable under water vapor and carbon dioxide atmospheres [18,19] . They can react with acidic gases, such as CO 2 , and moisture resulting in destruction of the perovskite structure [20\u201322] . Therefore, developing new proton-conducting materials with adequate protonic conductivity as well as good chemical stability over the range of IT-SOFCs, operating conditions has become a practical challenge. Considerable research efforts have focused on tailoring the phase stability and conductivity of proton conductors via doping [12,18\u201320,23\u201328] . BaZrO 3 has a similar lattice structure to BaCeO 3 , and possesses sufficiently high stability to water and carbon dioxide but poor protonic conductivity and poor sinterability [29\u201331] . The formation of a BaCeO 3 and BaZrO 3 solid solution may result in a balance between the chemical stability, sinterability and protonic conductivity. Zhong studied the stability and conductivity of the BaCe 0.9\u2212 x Zr x Y 0.1 O 2.95 series and found that the chemical stability increased while the electric conductivities of sintered samples decreased with the Zr content [23] . The optimal zirconium content was found to be around y = 0.4. The electrical conductivity and the chemical stability of BaCe 0.9\u2212 x Zr x Y 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 systems have also been investigated by Katahira et al. [20] , who came to similar conclusions. The phase stability and protonic conductivity of BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , a specific composition among the BaCe 0.8\u2212 y Zr y Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 series, was investigated by Zuo et al. An air|H 2 fuel cell with a 65 \u03bcm thick BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 electrolyte was fabricated and delivered attractive open circuit voltages of 1.01 and 1.05 V and peak power densities of 148 and 56 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively [19] . However, later experiments showed that BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 may still have insufficient stability under a reforming gas atmosphere. Fabbri et al. investigated the effect of the Zr doping amount on the sintering, CO 2 resistivity and fuel cell performance of BaCe 0.8\u2212 y Zr y Y 0.2 O 2.95 [12] . The optimal Zr doping content was found to around y = 0.5. A thick BaZr 0.5 Ce 0.3 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 electrolyte-supported cell sintered at 1550 \u00b0C for 8 h with Pt electrodes delivered a peak power density of only 18 mW cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C. It was found there was a synergetic effect between the electrode and electrolyte. In this work, we reported a systemic study of the relationship between the Zr doping content and the structure, chemical stability, carbon dioxide resistivity, sinterability and electrochemical properties of BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BZCY y ), 0.0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.8, by X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO 2 -temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and I \u2013 V polarization characterizations. An anode-supported thin-film electrolyte configuration was specifically adopted in this study. Effects of the electrolyte configuration on the sintering behavior were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) perovskite oxide was adopted as the cathode. Both BSCF and BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BZCY y , 0.0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.8) oxide powders were prepared by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process that uses analytic grade metal nitrates Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Zr(NO 3 ) 4 \u00b75H 2 O, Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O and Y(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O as raw materials. Taking the preparation of BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BZCY0.1) as an example, the required amounts of metal nitrates were mixed in solution state, and EDTA and citric acid were then added to serve as the complexing agents with the molar ratio of total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid set at 1:1:2. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to around 6 using NH 4 OH and the water was evaporated at 90 \u00b0C until transparent gels, were formed. These were pre-treated at 240 \u00b0C to remove most of the organics and then calcined at 900\u20131000 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere to obtain the products with the desired lattice structure. For sintering investigation, the powders with varied zirconium doping content calcined from 1000 \u00b0C were uniaxially pressed into cylindrical shape pellets (15 mm in diameter) at about 300 MPa and then sintered in air at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h. For fuel cell performance investigation, anode-supported cells with BZCY y ( y = 0.0, 0.4 and 0.8) electrolytes were prepared using a co-pressing technique. Anode powders consisting of 60 wt.% NiO and 40 wt.% BZCY y were prepared by mixing NiO and BZCY y with an agate mortar. To fabricate the single cell, the well-mixed NiO + BZCY y powders were dropped into a stainless steel die with a diameter of 15 mm and pressed as a substrate. BZCY y powder (about 0.03 g) was then distributed over the top of the substrate and pressed again to form a bilayer pellet, which was fired under stagnant air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h to make the densification of the electrolyte layer. The BSCF slurry was prepared by dispersing BSCF powder into a mixed solution of glycerol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol using high-energy ball milling (Fritsch Pulverisettle 6) at the rotation rate of 400 rpm for 40 min. This slurry was then painted on the central surface of the electrolyte. The triple-layered cell was fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. The resulted coin-shape cathode had an effective area of 0.48 cm 2 . 2.2 Single-cell test The cell performance was tested over a home-built fuel cell test station. The cell was sealed onto a quartz tube using silver paste as the sealing material. Three percent H 2 O humidified H 2 at a flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 and controlled by a mass flow controller (standard temperature pressure, STP) was fed into the anode chamber as fuel, and ambient air was adopted as the cathode atmosphere. I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected using a digital electrometer (Model 2420, Keithley, USA) based on the four-probe configuration. The impedance spectroscopy of the cells were measured under an open circuit voltage (OCV) condition with a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat that was interfaced with a computer using the Z -plot software. 2.3 Other characterizations The crystal structures of the synthesized powders and the pre-treated samples under a CO 2 atmosphere were determined using X-ray diffraction (Model D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning within the range of 20\u00b0 \u2264 2 \u03b8 \u2264 90\u00b0. The specific surface area of the synthesized powders was characterized by N 2 adsorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen using a BELSORP II instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were treated at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h in vacuum to remove the weakly adsorbed species on the surface. The microscopic features of the prepared electrolyte pellets and single cells were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; Model QUANTA-2000). A carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) study of the samples pretreated with CO 2 atmosphere at 650 \u00b0C for 2 h was conducted in a home-constructed multipurpose temperature-programmed apparatus. The test was performed from 200 to 930 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . Argon was used as the purge gas at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 and the effluent gas was monitored by a mass spectrometer (MS; Model QIC-20, Hiden, UK). The amount of sample was approximately 150 mg. The amount of carbonate formed in the samples after the treatment in a CO 2 atmosphere were calculated from the areas of desorption peaks using SrCO 3 as the standard substance. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure The oxide powders with the nominal composition of BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3 ( y = 0.0\u20130.8, 0.1 in step), calcined from 1000 \u00b0C in air and cooled down to room temperature naturally, were submitted for phase examination. As shown in Fig. 1 a , all of the oxides show the phase-pure perovskite-type structure. The lattice symmetry of the oxides can be indexed as mainly monoclinic for y = 0.0 (BaCe 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3 ), orthorhombic for y = 0.1\u20130.5, and cubic for y = 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8. The results agree well with those reported by Fabbri et al. [12] . To further demonstrate the formation of the solid solution over the whole range of Zr 4+ doping content ( y = 0.0\u20130.8), the lattice constants were determined from XRD analysis assuming quasi-cubic lattice symmetry and the results as shown in Fig. 1 b. A progressive decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Zr concentration was observed. Such a phenomenon can be well explained by the fact that Zr 4+ (0.72 \u00c5) has a smaller ionic radius than Ce 4+ (0.87 \u00c5) at the B-site of perovskite in six coordination with oxygen ion. There were no superlattice diffractions indicating an ordering of Ce 4+ and Zr 4+ at the Ce 4+ -site. From these results, we conclude that the Ce 4+ and Zr 4+ in BZCY y are likely randomly distributed in the lattice. 3.2 Chemical stability against CO 2 atmosphere One obvious feature of SOFC is its capability to operate on carbon-containing fuel. This is a great advantage over low temperature polymer-electrolyte fuel cell since hydrocarbons fuel has a much better matured infrastructure than hydrogen fuel. Although SOFCs with proton-conducting electrolyte cannot directly convert hydrocarbon fuel into electrical power, the hydrocarbon can be reformed to CO 2 and H 2 in-situ under the catalyst of the anode. Because of the high concentration of CO 2 in the reforming gas, the electrolyte should possess sufficient chemical stability against CO 2 . However, BaCeO 3 -based proton conductors were found to have poor chemical stability under CO 2 and H 2 O atmospheres [31] . Barium cerate can react with CO 2 and H 2 O according to reaction (1) and (2) , respectively, (1) BaCeO 3 + CO 2 \u2192 BaCO 3 + CeO 2 (2) BaCeO 3 + H 2 O \u2192 Ba(OH) 2 + CeO 2 It was reported that the increase of Zr concentration in BaZr y Ce 0.9\u2212 y Y 0.1 O 3 resulted in increase in the chemical stability of the oxide against CO 2 [25] . In order to verify the chemical stability of BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3 in CO 2 atmosphere, the BZCY y powders with various Zr contents in the lattice were exposed to pure CO 2 in a tube furnace at 650 \u00b0C for 2 h and the phase composition of the specimens was investigated by room-temperature X-ray diffraction. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding XRD patterns of the powders after the CO 2 exposure. It was observed that the perovskite structure of BZCY y oxides was destroyed when the carbonate formed at y \u2264 0.3. This suggests that reaction (1) happened during the treatment of BZCY y ( y = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) oxides in the CO 2 atmosphere. Thus, BZCY y with a low zirconium doping concentration ( y \u2264 0.3) may not be applicable as an electrolyte for SOFC operating on a reforming gas. When the zirconium doping amount ( y ) reached 0.4, the main perovskite structure was survived although some diffraction peaks of carbonate were still observed. With the further increase of Zr doping concentration ( y \u2265 0.4), the relative intensity of perovskite increased while the peak intensity of carbonate decreased sharply. At y = 0.8, no carbonate diffraction peak was detected in the XRD diffraction pattern of the oxide after the CO 2 treatment. Similar phenomena were also observed by Fabbri et al. [12] , who observed that the perovskite structure survived at y = 0.5 or higher after the BZCY y samples were treated in pure CO 2 at 900 \u00b0C for 3 h. Our results are also consistent with some reports under similar experimental conditions [12,19,20,23] . However, X-ray diffraction is not a sufficiently precise tool for this analysis because of carbonate may exist in the amorphous state which is not detectable by XRD, the CO 2 -TPD technique was applied to further determine the effect of Zr doping on the chemical stability against carbon dioxide. The oxide powders after the treatment in the CO 2 atmosphere were put into a U-type quartz tube reactor. After blowing away the weakly adsorbed impurities on the surface by an argon purge for about half an hour, the temperature of oxide powder was increased at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 with the help of a temperature controller. Any carbonate formed over the oxide surface or in the bulk was thermally decomposed into gaseous carbon dioxide, which was carried out by the sweep gas argon to the on-line mass spectrometer (MS) for analysis of the CO 2 concentration. Fig. 3 shows the CO 2 -TPD profiles of the BZCY y ( y = 0.0\u20130.8) oxides at various Zr content. Two kinds of CO 2 desorption peaks were observed for all samples with one peak around 600 \u00b0C (named as \u03b1 desorption), and the other located between 800 and 930 \u00b0C (named as \u03b2 desorption). They can be ascribed to the desorption of the surface-absorbed CO 2 and the decomposition of the bulk carbonate, respectively. It was observed that the BZCY y oxides had a very large \u03b2 desorption peak at high temperature at y = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. BZCY0.1 had an even bigger \u03b2 desorption peak area than that of undoped BCY. When the zirconium content y reached 0.4, the desorption peak intensity decreased significantly, and the peak intensity decreased with a further increase of Zr content. With the increase of the zirconium content, the \u03b2 desorption peak moved towards the lower temperature range. This suggests that the formation of carbonate becomes more difficult when there is more zirconium. In other words, the chemical stability of the oxide against CO 2 was improved as the Zr content increased, agreeing well with observations in the literature [21,23] . Since the solid\u2013gas reaction occurred over the solid surface, the amount of carbonate is also closely related to the surface area of the oxide. The specific surface areas of the oxides with varying zirconium content were measured, and the results are listed in Table 1 . They show that the surface area increased with increasing zirconium content, which is in agreement with the general observation of the suppressing effect of zirconium on the sintering of the oxide [32] . The area of the desorption peak reflects the amount of carbonate in BZCY y , which was quantitatively determined by applying pure SrCO 3 as an external standard substance. The area-specific carbonate formative rates over BZCY y at various Zr contents are also listed in Table 1 . They clearly show that small amount of Zr doping efficiently suppressed the carbonate formation. When only 1/8 of the Ce site was substituted by Zr with the formation of BZCY0.1, the carbonate formative rate decreased more than three-fold. With the further increase of the zirconium doping amount the carbonation formative rate reduced monotonically. The formative rate of carbonate is 7.50 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 at y = 0.0 while it is only 7.00 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 at y = 0.8. Furthermore, there was almost no bulk carbonate formed at y = 0.8. The above results are in full agreement with the XRD results. 3.3 Sinterability It was generally believed that the BaZrO 3 -based oxides are much more difficult to sinter than the BaCeO 3 -based perovskite oxides. Thus, the increase of zirconium content in BZCY y is believed to result in worse sinterability of the oxide. The increase of specific surface area with zirconium doping concentration as shown in Table 1 strongly supports this assumption. Typical SOFCs employ a nickel-based anode since nickel possesses high electronic conductivity, excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen electro catalytic oxidation, and also favorable activity for reforming of hydrocarbons to hydrogen. However, nickel oxide is also easily sintered at high temperature. The fuel cell electrode should have sufficient porosity to allow the free diffusion of gaseous reactants and products to minimize the concentration polarization. Thus, a sintering temperature of 1350\u20131450 \u00b0C is usually applied for the nickel-based anode. Such a sintering temperature ensures good connection between the anode particles and also maintains sufficient anode surface area and porosity for electrode reactions. In a previous study, high sintering temperatures above 1550 \u00b0C were applied for the densification of BZCY y electrolytes, especially for those with high zirconium doping contents [32] . Such high sintering temperatures may still be applicable for electrolyte-supported SOFCs since the electrolyte layer can be fabricated separately from the anode and cathode layers, although higher sintering temperature means higher fabrication costs. To reduce the electrolyte ohmic drop, a thin-film electrolyte configuration was applied in this study. To maintain sufficient mechanical strength, the thin electrolyte layer must be supported on a substrate. Nowadays, an anode-supported thin-film electrolyte configuration is usually applied, and this configuration was also adopted in this study. A co-firing of the anode\u2013electrolyte dual-layer cell to densify the electrolyte layer is necessary in the fabrication of the anode-supported thin-film electrolyte SOFC. To avoid the sintering of the anode, the cell should be sintered at a temperature lower than 1500 \u00b0C. Therefore, a sintering temperature of 1500 \u00b0C was first adopted for the BZCY y electrolytes. The BZCY y powders were pressed into thick disk-shape pellets using a stainless steel die and sintered at 1500 \u00b0C in air for 5 h. Fig. 4 shows the surface morphologies of the BZCY y ( y = 0.0, 0.1 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 0.8) electrolyte after sintering at 1500 \u00b0C. The BCY electrolyte was well densified, and very few enclosed pores were observed. With an increase in the Zr doping content, an increasing number of enclosed pores were observed. At y = 0.3, the electrolyte was still well densified. However, a considerable number of pores were observed inside the pellet at y = 0.4. At y = 0.7 and 0.8, the pellets were in highly porous state which was similar to the initial powder with a very fine grain size. Table 2 lists the linear shrinkage of the disk after the sintering and the relative density of the resulting pellets, calculated based on the volume of the pellet found by measuring the diameter, thickness and the weight, and using the theoretical density of the oxides. Table 2 clearly shows a monotonic decrease in sintering density with increasing Zr doping content. At y = 0.8, the relative density is only 65.67%. A similar suppressing effect of zirconium doping on the sintering of the electrolyte was reported in literature [33] . In the anode-supported thin-film electrolyte configuration, the anode and the electrolyte layers are co-fired at a high temperature, so the sintering behavior of the electrolyte layer may be affected by the anode. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the sintering behavior of the dual layer cells. The NiO + BZCY y anode-supported thin-film BZCY y dual-layer cells were fabricated by a dual drying pressing. The green dual-layer pellets were then co-fired at a high temperature. To ensure sufficient porosity of the anode layer, the co-firing temperature was reduced to 1450 \u00b0C. Shown in Fig. 5 are the cross sectional photos of the as-fabricated single cells with BZCY y electrolytes ( y = 0.0, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.8) and the BSCF cathode (1000 \u00b0C fired). The electrolyte has a thickness of 25\u201340 \u03bcm. As compared to the self-supported thick BZCY y electrolytes, the thin-film electrolytes were much more densified at a high zirconium doping amount. Even with the BZCY0.8 electrolyte, no penetrated pores were observed although a large number of enclosed pores were still observed inside the electrolyte layer. This implies that the anode-supported configuration helped the sintering of the thin-film electrolyte. The sintering of the thin-film electrolyte on the anode substrate is actually a constraint sintering process. Since the anode is about 0.6 mm which is more than 10 times that of the electrolyte thickness (25\u201340 \u03bcm), the anode has a greater impact on the sintering behavior of the thin-film electrolyte than the electrolyte has on the sintering of the anode. As shown in Table 2 , the shrinkages of the anode after the sintering were 15.45%, 15.12%, 14.85%, 13.73%, 12.97% and 11.99% for y = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, for the anode-supported dual-layer cells. As compared to the self-supported BZCYy, at lower zirconium doping content, i.e., y = 0.0 or 0.1, the electrolyte shrinkage is slightly bigger than for the self-supported thick BZCY y electrolyte. At high zirconium doping content, i.e., y = 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8, the shrinkage of the thin-film electrolyte was much larger than that of the self-supported thick BZCY y electrolyte. This then explained the relatively worse sintering of the thin-film BZCY electrolyte at low zirconium doping content than the sintering of the thin-film BZCY electrolyte at high zirconium doping content. At a high zirconium doping content, the large anode shrinkage allowed for better contact of the electrolyte BZCY y particles and accelerated the sintering of the thin-film electrolyte. This may be one of the important causes for the improved sintering of the thin-film electrolyte at high zirconium doping concentrations. The inter-diffusion of metal ions between the anode and electrolyte layers during the high temperature sintering may also facilitate the sintering of the electrolyte layer. It has been reported that nickel oxide is a sintering aid for the BaZr 0.85 Y 0.15 O 3 proton-conducting electrolyte by Babilo and Haile [34] . 3.4 Fuel cell performance The fuel cell performance of the above mentioned anode-supported fuel cells was investigated by applying 3% H 2 O humidified hydrogen as the fuel and ambient air as the cathode atmosphere. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependences of the open circuit voltages (OCV) of the cells with different zirconium contents in the BZCY y electrolyte. High OCVs of around 1.10 V, near the theoretical values, were observed for the fuel cells with BZCY y electrolytes. This suggests that there was no serious leakage of the electrolyte membranes. This further supports the fact that the electrolyte layers were well densified and that the possible diffusion of nickel oxide into the electrolyte during the high temperature sintering did not have obvious effect on the transportation properties of the electrolyte on the other hand. The high OCVs of the fuel cell with the BZCY0.8 electrolyte imply that the electrolyte membrane was also well densified, although the sintering was low at 1450 \u00b0C. This agrees well with the SEM observations. Although BSCF has been applied to many oxygen ion conducting electrolytes such as SDC, the application of BSCF on proton conductors is still rarely reported. Our primary results have shown the potential application of BSCF also for BCY electrolyte [3] . Fig. 7 shows the I \u2013 V curves of the cells that have the same cathode of BSCF but different BZCY y electrolytes. The linear response of the cell voltage to the applied polarization current density indicates that the concentration polarization did not occur for all fuel cells. It suggests that the electrodes are sufficient porous for the free diffusion of the gaseous reactants and reaction products, which is due to the low sintering temperature of the cells. For the fuel cell with the BCY electrolyte, a peak power density of \u223c550 mW cm \u22122 at 750 \u00b0C was achieved, which is among the best results reported in the previous works about H + -SOFCs [3,12] . At 500 \u00b0C, a peak power density of 81 mW cm \u22122 was still obtained. With the increase of the zirconium content in the electrolyte, the cell performance decreased progressively. At y = 0.8, a peak power density of about 45 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 700 \u00b0C, which was higher than that for the thick BZCY0.8 electrolyte-supported cell with Pt electrodes as reported previously [12] . A favorable power density of 220 mW cm \u22122 was obtained at 750 \u00b0C and 84 mW cm \u22122 at 450 \u00b0C for the cell with the BZCY0.4 electrolyte. In connection with the favorable chemical stability against the CO 2 atmosphere and the good sintering in the thin-film configuration, BZCY0.4 is a potential electrolyte material for intermediate-temperature SOFCs. Fig. 8 is the impedance spectroscopy of the cells with BZCY0.4 electrolytes. The spectroscopy indicates that both the ohmic resistance and the electrode polarization resistance increased with the decrease of temperature, which accounts for the reduced cell performance. But the omhic resistance is still much larger than the electrode polarization resistance at high temperatures. Even at 450 \u00b0C, the ohmic resistance is more than twice that of the electrode. This suggests that a further reduction in the electrolyte membrane thickness could result in an obvious increase in the cell performance. Based on the BaCe 0.4 Zr 0.4 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 protonic conductivity at 700 \u00b0C [12,20] , the ohmic resistance of the 35 \u03bcm thick film are estimated to be \u223c0.38 \u03a9 cm 2 . The large difference in ohmic resistance (\u223c1.02 \u03a9 cm 2 ) of the single cell is probably due to the additional contact resistance from the BSCF/BZCY0.4 interface and the Ni-BZCY0.4/BZCY0.4 interface as well as the wires. This may be the main reason for the poor cell performance even when the thin-film BZCY y electrolyte at high Zr content was adopted. It has been demonstrated that BSCF is not a good cathode for zirconium-based cells due to the serious interfacial reaction [35] . We have also demonstrated previously that the phase reaction between BSCF and BCY could form an interfacial layer with much lower conductivity than BCY, resulting in a significant decrease of the apparent electrolyte conductivity. The development of new cathode materials with high activity for oxygen reduction but negligible reactivity with BZCY electrolyte is then of significant importance for improving the cell performance of a fuel cell with heavily zirconium-doped BZCY y electrolyte. 4 Conclusions The lattice constant and the sinterability of BZCY y decreased with increasing the Zr content while chemical stability against the CO 2 atmosphere increased. The perovskite structure of the BZCY y oxides was seriously destroyed as carbonate was formed at y \u2264 0.3, but the main perovskite structure was survived at y = 0.4 and higher. The formative rate of carbonate was 8.70 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 at y = 0.4 while the formative rate of carbonate were 7.50 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 and only 7.00 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 at y = 0.0 and 0.8, respectively. The anode-supported configuration helped the sintering of the thin-film electrolyte. For a fuel cell with the BCY electrolyte, peak power density of about 550 and 81 mW cm \u22122 were obtained at 750 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively. With the increase of the zirconium content in the electrolyte, the cell performance decreased progressively. At y = 0.8, a peak power densities of approximately 45 and 8 mW cm \u22122 were achieved at 700 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively. However, a favorable power density of 220 mW cm \u22122 was obtained at 750 \u00b0C and 84 mW cm \u22122 was obtained at 450 \u00b0C for the cell with the BZCY0.4 electrolyte. In order to further improve the H + -SOFCs performance, increasing the relative density of BaZr y Ce 0.8\u2212 y Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (0.0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.8) (BZCY y ) with higher Zr doping content and increasing the sinterability by applying metal oxide as a sintering additives at lower temperature may be investigated. The development of new cathode materials with high activity for oxygen reduction but negligible reactivity with BZCY y electrolyte is also a significant future step.

        "abstract": "The wet powder spraying (WPS) technique was used for the deposition of dense and thin (Y 2 O 3 ) 0.08 (ZrO 2 ) 0.92 (YSZ-8) films on an anode substrate being used for fuel cell applications. Both agglomeration of the powder and the presence of organics in the substrate have a significant effect on the quality and densification of the thin electrolyte layer. High-energy ball milling effectively broke up the agglomerates and enhanced the packing density of the green layer. Pre-calcination of the substrate at \u223c1000 \u00b0C enhanced the match of sintering shrinkage between the electrolyte layer and the substrate and improved the quality of the YSZ-8 thin film significantly. Crack-free dual-layer assembly with a highly densified YSZ-8 film as thin as 10 \u03bcm was successfully fabricated by optimizing the fabrication parameters. The cells with a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode showed a high open circuit voltage of 1.071 V and a peak power density of 894 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C operated with hydrogen fuel. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) Thin electrolyte film Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) Wet powder spraying (WPS) 1 Introduction Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) membranes are the most widely applied solid-state electrolytes of high-temperature oxygen sensors, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), and electrolyzers, because of their high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures, good thermal/chemical stability, and favorable mechanical strength. For SOFCs based on a thick YSZ electrolyte, an operating temperature as high as 1000 \u00b0C is necessary to achieve high power density, which, however, puts stringent requirement on the sealing and also induces a rapid degradation of cell performance due to the high solid-state reaction rate between cell components. In order to solve or avoid the above problems, extensive research has been conducted to reduce the operating temperature of SOFCs to an intermediate range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C. However, since the ionic conductivity of YSZ decreases obviously with the drop in temperature, the development of new electrolyte materials with improved ionic conductivities at reduced temperature has been proposed to ensure a high power density at intermediate temperature [1\u20133] . A reduction of the electrolytic thickness has also been proposed [4] . A number of coating techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD), and ceramic powder processes have been exploited to fabricate dense YSZ electrolyte on porous substrates for SOFC applications [5\u201320] . Among these techniques, ceramic powder processes [11\u201314] such as tape casting [15,16] , slurry coating [17,18] , and screen-printing [19,20] are economical and efficient techniques for ceramic coating; however, they are only appropriate for flat cells. Furthermore, the large shrinkage associated with the removal of polymeric binders and plasticizers in subsequent sintering steps may reduce the quality of large area cells. Wet powder spraying (WPS) has been successfully used as a processing technique for forming porous gas electrodes [21\u201324] . This process does not require as much binder as the ceramic powder processes. More importantly, WPS is a non-contact technique that is highly suitable for engineering structures, for example, functionally graded electrodes. Furthermore, it is also applicable to a variety of surfaces, corrugated sheets, and tubes. Compared to most of the above-mentioned deposition techniques, the deposition rates of WPS are high and the fabrication costs are low. Moreover, it has a high potential for up-scaling from laboratory to industrial fabrication. Sch\u00fcller et al. [25] demonstrated that the WPS process is a practicable method to produce a thin gas-tight electrolyte layer by optimizing the suspensions in solid content and viscosity. Recently, this method has been successfully applied to prepare thin electrolyte film for SOFCs [26,27] . However, there are few studies concerning the preparation process of this technique. In this paper, we present detailed investigation of the WPS process for the fabrication of an anode-supported YSZ thin film for SOFC application. Attention was paid to the effects of powder agglomeration and the properties of the anode substrate on thin film formation and densification. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of powder and anode-support All the raw materials applied in this study were provided from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China in analytical grade. (Y 2 O 3 ) 0.08 (ZrO 2 ) 0.92 (YSZ-8) powders were synthesized using a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process with the detailed procedure referred to our previous publication [28] . Y(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O and Zr(NO 3 ) 4 \u00b75H 2 O were prepared in a mixed solution followed by the addition of EDTA and citric acid in sequence at a pH value of \u223c6 with the help of NH 4 OH with a mole ratio of total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid of 1:1:2. Evaporating the water at 90 \u00b0C resulted in the transparent gels, which were then pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and further calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to give the final products. The anode substrate was prepared by a dry-pressing method. A mixture consisting of well-mixed 57 wt.% NiO, 38 wt.% YSZ, and 5 wt.% PVB was dropped into a stainless steel die with a diameter of 15 mm and then pressed under 200 MPa for 1 min. The green pellets were directly applied as the substrates for spray deposition of the thin electrolyte film, or they were pre-calcined before deposition at 900\u20131400 \u00b0C for 5 h to get rid of the organics within the substrates and to modify their shrinkage. 2.2 Preparation of suspension The suspension for spray deposition was prepared as follows. About 2 g of the YSZ-8 powder and 20 g of ethylene glycol (EG) were mixed with 60 g of zirconia grinding media in an 80 mL zirconia container and agitated on a high-energy miller (Model Pulverisette 6, Fritsch, Germany) with a rotational speed of 500 rpm for 30 min. After the milling, additional ethylene glycol was added to the YSZ suspension to reach a total ethylene glycol amount of 80 g. No further additives such as binders, plasticizers, or dispersants were used. The powder content in the diluted suspension was around 2.4 wt.%. For a comparative study, an YSZ-8 powder suspension was also prepared by mixing 1 g of the YSZ-8 powders and 40 g of the ethylene glycol in an agate mortar for 30 min with the help of manual grinding. 2.3 WPS process and fabrication of single cell The suspension was sprayed onto the anode substrate using a modified spraying gun (BD-128, Fenghua Bida Machinery Manufacture Co. Ltd., Fenghua, China) with a nozzle size of 0.35 mm (diameter). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a working pressure of 1 atm. The spraying gun was aligned vertically to the anode substrate leaving a 10 mm distance between them. The spray speed was controlled at about 0.005 g (YSZ-8) s \u22121 . The spray process was carried out at a substrate temperature of \u223c200 \u00b0C with the help of a hot plate. After the spray deposition, the green dual-layer pellets were fired at 1400 \u00b0C in air for 5 h at a heating rate of 3 \u00b0C min \u22121 . La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) slurry was then painted on the central surface of the electrolyte by brush and fired at 1150 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to function as the cathode layer. The resulting coin-shape cathode had a thickness of \u223c20 \u03bcm and an effective area of 0.5 cm 2 . 2.4 Characterization Crystal structures of the synthesized powders were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Model D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The crystallite domain sizes ( D ) were examined from XRD peaks based on the Scherrer equation, D = 0.9 \u03bb /( B cos \u03b8 ), where \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength, \u03b8 is the Bragg diffraction angle, and B is the calibrated half-peak width of the XRD lines. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning in the range of 20\u00b0 \u2264 2 \u03b8 \u2264 80\u00b0. The particle size distribution of the milled powders was measured with a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer 3000, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The particle size and the morphology of the derived YSZ-8 powders were also examined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM; Tecnai G20, FEI. Co. Ltd., Eindhoven, Netherlands) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Sirion 200, FEI. Co. Ltd., Philips, Netherlands). The morphology of the YSZ-8 film was observed using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; Model QUANTA-2000, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). Packing density of the green YSZ-8 thin film on the anode-substrate was estimated by assuming it was identical to the green density of the corresponding electrolyte powders. In some cases, it was also estimated from the volume change of the thin film before and after sintering by measuring the diameter of the anode substrate with a vernier caliper and the thin-film thickness using SEM and assuming that the relative density of the thin-film layer is 100% after the sintering. An in-house constructed fuel cell test station was applied for electrochemical performance evaluation of the fabricated cells. Humidified (3% H 2 O) H 2 at a flow rate of 80 mL min \u22121 [STP] was fed into the anode as fuel and air 400 mL min \u22121 [STP] was used as the cathode atmosphere. I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected at intervals of 50 \u00b0C over a temperature range of 850\u2013700 \u00b0C using a digital electrometer (Model 2420, Keithley, Cleveland, OH) based on a four-probe configuration. Mass flow controllers were used to control flow rates. Silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai Institute of Synthesized Risen) was painted on the outer surface of the cathode and then fired at 250 \u00b0C to get rid of organics as a current collector. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the single cells were measured by Solartron-1260 frequency responding analyzer combined with Solartron-1287 electrochemical interface. The EIS were recorded in a frequency range of 10 kHz to 1 Hz with signal amplitude of 30 mV under open circuit voltage (OCV). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared YSZ-8 powders after they were calcined at various temperatures in air for 5 h. At a temperature of >500 \u00b0C, a crystallized phase was formed. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to a cubic fluorite lattice structure, implying the successful formation of pure phase fluorite oxide. The crystallite size calculated based on the Scherrer equation for the powder calcined at 900 \u00b0C is about 22.1 nm. The particle distribution of the YSZ suspension after the manual grinding is shown in Fig. 2 . It shows two distribution zones with an average particle sizes of 210 (36.1 vol%) and 1170 nm (63.9 vol%), respectively. Both particle sizes are much larger than the crystallite size, suggesting that the agglomeration formed in the YSZ-8 powders prepared from the EDTA\u2013citrate combined complexing process even after the manual grinding. The powder was further investigated by FESEM and TEM observations with the results shown in Fig. 3 . It clearly shows that the powder was mainly composed of small primary particles with a grain size of \u223c200 nm, which was highly densified and free of pores or voids ( Fig. 3 a), suggesting the sintering of the primary particles. Such particles agglomerated seriously to form larger particles containing many voids and pores, as shown in Fig. 3 b and c. The surface morphology of the sintered YSZ-8 electrolyte with the 900 \u00b0C calcined powder ground manually is shown in Fig. 4 a . Many cracks were observed over the membrane surface after the sintering at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h. For the dual-layer membrane, the shrinking and densification behaviors of each layer were affected by the other layer during the sintering. Considering that the anode-substrate (500\u20131000 \u03bcm) is much thicker than the electrolyte (10\u201350 \u03bcm), the sintering behavior of the thin electrolyte film was influenced more significantly by the anode than the anode by the thin film. In order to get a crack-free and fully densified YSZ-8 thin film, the shrinkage of the anode-substrate and the thin electrolyte film should be tailored. Under the most ideal situation, the shrinkage of the anode-substrate ( S A ) should be equal to that of the thin electrolyte film ( S E ) required for a fully densified electrolyte (1) S A = S E . Assuming that the shrinkage of the YSZ thin film is identical in all three dimensions, it can be expressed by (2) S E = D 0 \u2212 D 1 D 0 = d 0 \u2212 d 1 d 0 = 1 \u2212 D 1 D 0 = 1 \u2212 d 1 d 0 , or (3) S A = 1 \u2212 ( \u03c0 D 1 2 d 1 ) / 4 3 ( \u03c0 D 0 2 d 0 ) / 4 3 = 1 \u2212 V 1 3 V 0 3 = 1 \u2212 m / \u03c1 1 3 m / \u03c1 0 3 = 1 \u2212 \u03c1 0 3 \u03c1 1 3 , where D 0 and d 0 are the diameter and the thickness of the green YSZ-8 thin film, and D 1 and d 1 are the diameter and the thickness of the sintered YSZ-8 thin film, respectively; V 0 and \u03c1 0 are the volume and the packing density of the green YSZ-8 thin film, and V 1 and \u03c1 1 are the volume and the density of the sintered YSZ-8 thin film, respectively. This equation indicates that the required shrinkage of the anode-substrate is determined by the packing density of the green YSZ-8 thin film. The higher the packing density of the green thin film, the less shrinkage of the anode-substrate is needed to achieve a fully densified thin electrolyte film. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , there was still serious agglomeration in the powder prepared by the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process even after manual grinding. Such agglomerates resulted in a low green density of the powder due to the presence of many pores and voids inside the agglomerates. A green density of as small as 3% has been reported for the powder prepared by the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process [29] . Such a low green density is actually beneficial for the fabrication of a thin electrolyte film on a substrate by a co-pressing technique [29,30] . Since the mechanical press can break the soft agglomerates easily, a high packing density of \u223c60% can be achieved for the green electrolyte layer prepared by the co-pressing technique. As to the green YSZ-8 thin film prepared by the WPS process, the particles were packed under the drive of liquid vehicles (EG). The relatively weak driving force of the liquid vehicle inputted on the powder could not break up the agglomerates during the spraying process. Such loosely packed agglomerates resulted in a low packing density of the green YSZ-8 thin film. The green density of the powder that had been subjected to manual grinding, reached only \u223c0.96 g cm \u22123 with a relative density of \u223c16.7%, in comparison to \u223c4.5% for the freshly synthesized YSZ-8 powder. Assuming the identical shrinkage for the thin film in three dimensions during sintering, the shrinkage of the anode-substrate should reach as large as 44.9% in order to achieve a relative density of 100% for a gas-tight dense electrolyte. However, the sintering shrinkage of the current anode-substrate reached only \u223c15.7%. Although the z -direction perpendicular to the membrane surface is free of constraint during the sintering and may shrink more significantly than the x , y directions, such a large difference between the shrinkage of the anode and the required shrinkage of the thin-film layer implies that the YSZ-8 thin film is under a large tension during the sintering, which likely causes the formation of large cracks in the electrolyte during the sintering. The cross-sectional morphologies of the green and sintered YSZ-8 thin films are shown in Fig. 4 b and c. There are considerable voids with a size of about 2\u20135 \u03bcm observed for the green YSZ-8 thin film. After the sintering, there are many enclosed pores including cracks formed in the bulk of the electrolyte. Such pores are detrimental to the ionic conduction in the electrolyte by blocking the oxygen diffusion paths. Kingery and Francois [31] suggested that, for a given packing form, whether a pore shrinks or not during sintering is dependent on the pore coordination number P . If P < P C (critical pore coordination number, denoted P C ), the surface of the pore will move toward its center of curvature and the decrease in the pore surface energy is greater than the increase in the grain-boundary energy, so the pore will shrink. On the contrary, if P > P C , the pore will grow. For the manually ground YSZ-8 suspension, the agglomerates have a large number of voids, which led to not only the low packing density but also to a high pore coordination number. The formation of the enclosed holes and cracks is then closely related to the agglomerates inside the green layer. The mechanism for the formation of such holes and cracks is schematically shown in Fig. 5 . Improving the packing density of the green YSZ thin film is critical to obtain a crack-free dense thin electrolyte film by WPS process. It was reported that the agglomerates can be effectively broken by mechanical milling [32,33] . In order to improve the packing density of the thin electrolyte film by WPS with the electrolyte powder prepared from the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process, the powder was then subjected to high-energy ball milling before deposition. Fig. 6 shows the particle size distribution of the YSZ-8 suspension after high-energy ball milling at 500 rpm for 30 min. Only one sharp distribution peak was observed with a main particle size of \u223c220 nm, while the distribution peak at around 1 \u03bcm that was in the manually ground samples had totally disappeared after the ball milling. It implies that the agglomerates in the original powder were successfully broken up after the high-energy ball milling. The green density of the high-energy ball milled YSZ-8 powder now reached 1.92 g cm \u22123 , amounting to a relative density of \u223c32.2%. To obtain a relative density of 100% for the sintered YSZ-8 thin film, the shrinkage of the anode-substrate should reach 30.7% assuming the uniform constriction in all three dimensions. The packing density of the YSZ-8 thin film was also estimated from the volume change of the thin film after sintering. A 1000 \u00b0C pre-calcined anode-substrate was used as the substrate. The thicknesses of the thin film are 16.7 and 6.3 \u03bcm (measured by SEM shown in Fig. 7 ), and the diameters of the thin film are 14.6 and 12.5 mm (measured with a vernier caliper), before and after sintering, respectively. By assuming the density of the sintered electrolyte is 100% after sintering, the packing density of the thin electrolyte film reaches \u223c27.7%, which is slightly smaller than the green density of the starting powder. This suggests that the organics in the suspension may result in looser packing of the YSZ-8 powders in the green thin film. The shrinkage of the electrolyte in the unconstrained z -direction is as high as 62.3%, which is much higher than that in x , y directions (14.3%). Such a large shrinkage in the z -direction is beneficial because the required shrinkage of the anode-substrate is lowered significantly. The typical SEM morphologies of the green dual-layer cell and the sintered one prepared using a ball-milled YSZ-8 powder are shown in Fig. 8 . Compared to the one prepared from the manually ground YSZ-8 powder, the green thin film prepared from the ball-milled powder is obviously more compact with no observable large voids. After the high-temperature sintering, most part of the thin film was well densified and had adhered to the anode substrate fairly well. However, in some areas, serious cracks are still observed with a length of \u223c100 \u03bcm. In order to obtain a defect-free anode-substrate, some organic additives were introduced into the anode powder purposefully, as described in Section 2 . The organics in the anode-substrate, however, were oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O during the sintering. During the oxidation, it produced \u223c110 mL of gases (standard temperature pressure, and STP) per gram of green anode-substrate. Once there were not enough channels for the gas to vent, the gas could be trapped inside the anode. With increasing the temperature, the gas pressure increased steadily. After the pressure reached a critical value, the tension became so great that it finally cracked the electrolyte layer to release the pressure. The mechanism for the crack-formation over the YSZ-8 thin film deposited on organics-containing anode is schematically shown in Fig. 9 . In order to avoid the detrimental effect of gas formation on the quality of the YSZ-8 thin film, a pre-calcination of the anode-substrate was adopted to eliminate the organics in the substrate before the thin-film layer deposition. However, the pre-calcination would result in a decrease of anode shrinkage and a deterioration of the mechanical strength of the anode-substrate. Therefore, the heating of the anode-substrate should be controlled elaborately. Fig. 10 shows the effect of pre-calcination temperature on the second shrinkage of the anode-substrate. The second shrinkage reached only 13.7% and 14.8%, respectively, when the pre-calcination temperatures were 1100 and 1000 \u00b0C. On the other hand, the anode-substrate had very poor mechanical strength when it was pre-calcined at 900 \u00b0C due to the weak adhesion between particles. As previously demonstrated, the anode-substrate shrank about 14.6% after sintering for the dual-layer green cells; the second shrinkage of the anode-substrate is nearest to this shrinkage after it was pre-calcined at 1000 \u00b0C. Therefore, the anode-substrate was subjected to pre-calcination at 1000 \u00b0C before thin-film layer deposition. Fig. 11 shows the surface and the cross-sectional morphologies of the electrolyte after sintering at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h by adopting the 1000 \u00b0C pre-calcined anode as the substrate. The electrolyte layer was well densified, and it adhered to the anode-substrate fairly well. By examination of the whole electrolyte surface by SEM, no crack was observable. It suggests that a pre-calcination of the anode-substrate at the proper temperature is critical to obtain a crack-free dense thin electrolyte film. Single cells were then constructed from the dual-layer cells by applying LSM perovskite as the cathode. The fuel cell performance was then examined by I \u2013 V characterization. Fig. 12 shows the measured OCVs of the fabricated cell as a function of temperature with air as cathode atmosphere and hydrogen as the anode fuel. For comparison, the theoretical values are also presented. The OCV is closely related to the densification of the electrolyte as well as the operating conditions. Cracks and penetrated pinholes in the electrolyte layer would result in mixed potentials over the anode and cathode, and lead to substantially lower OCVs than the theoretical values. The observed OCVs are close to the theoretical values, suggesting that the thin electrolyte film is well densified, agreeing well with the SEM observations. The slight difference between the e.m.f. and the OCVs of the single cell may come from the hydrogen permeating the sealant, which may yield the mixed potential resulting from the following reactions: (4) H 2 \u2192 2H + + 2e \u2212 (5) 1 2 O 2 + 2 H + + 2 e \u2212 \u2192 H 2 O Some studies indicated that this H 2 loss should be responsible for the disagreement between the OCVs and e.m.f. values [34\u201337] . Fig. 13 shows the cell voltages and power densities for a single cell with a 20 \u03bcm thick YSZ-8 thin film sintered at 1400 \u00b0C. The peak power densities of the single cell are 206, 276, 401, and 567 mW cm \u22122 at 700, 750, 800, and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Fig. 14 further shows the cell voltages and power densities for a single cell tested at 850 \u00b0C as a function of electrolytic thickness. The peak power densities are 894, 567, and 307 mW cm \u22122 and the OCVs are 1.068, 1.071, and 1.092 V for the single cells with the electrolytic thicknesses of 10, 20, and 50 \u03bcm, respectively. The corresponding EIS measured under the OCV conditions are shown in Fig. 15 . Here, the intercept with the real axis at high frequencies represents the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and lead wires. As expected, the ohmic resistances increase steadily with increasing the electrolytic thicknesses, i.e. 0.127, 0.239, and 0.564 \u03a9 cm 2 for the single cells with the electrolytic thicknesses of 10, 20, and 50 \u03bcm, respectively. The resistance between the two intercepts with the real axis corresponds to the impedance of the two interfaces, i.e. the cathode\u2013electrolyte interface and the anode\u2013electrolyte interface. Since the anodes and cathodes are nominally identical, the area specific resistances of electrodes are very similar. It should be noted that the power density is not in reverse proportion to the electrolytic thickness. For example, the peak power density of the cell with a 10-\u03bcm thick electrolyte is only about three times that of the cell with a 50-\u03bcm thick electrolyte. It suggests that the resistance from the electrodes plays a significant role in the fuel cell performance in this study. This is reasonable because LSM is not a good performance cathode at intermediate temperatures. It is expected that even higher power densities can be achieved by optimizing the electrode composition. 4 Conclusions A WPS process is successfully applied to fabricate a dense YSZ-8 thin film on an anode-substrate for a solid-oxide fuel cell application. Agglomerates in as-prepared YSZ-8 powders result in a low packing density of YSZ-8 green thin film, and which induce the formation of cracks and enclosed holes inside the thin electrolyte film during the sintering. High-energy ball milling is an efficient method to break up such agglomerates and substantially increases the packing density of the green thin film. On the other hand, the anode-substrate also has a significant influence on the sintering process of the electrolyte. Gases that are produced from the pyrolysis of organics in the anode added during the substrate fabrication would break the electrolyte during the sintering. Pre-calcination of the substrate at \u223c1000 \u00b0C can effectively eliminate its effect on the quality of the thin film, also the second shrinkage of the anode matches well with the YSZ-8 thin film. Accordingly, the crack-free dense YSZ-8 thin film was fabricated with a thickness as low as 10 \u03bcm. The corresponding open circuit voltage of the single cell based on a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode is 1.071 V, and the peak power density is as high as 894 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C.

        "abstract": "In this study, we report a novel approach for suppressing coke formation in direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a conventional nickel cermet anode by simply adding ammonia to the fuel gas. Because ammonia preferentially occupies the acidic sites of the anode catalyst materials, a significant decrease in the coke formation rate is realized by introducing ammonia into the methane gas. In addition, hydrogen, a decomposition product of ammonia, also acts as an additional fuel for the SOFCs, resulting in high cell performance. At 700 C, the coke formation rate over the Ni-YSZ anode is suppressed by 71% after the addition of 33.3% NH3 into CH4. Suppressed coke formation is also observed for other Ni catalysts such as Ni/Al 2O3, a common catalyst for methane reforming that has been successfully used as the anode catalyst layer for SOFCs operating on methane, which suggests that introducing NH3 as an additive gas is a general method for suppressing the coke formation. The addition of ammonia can also effectively improve the power output and operational stability and offers a novel means for developing new coke-resistant SOFCs operating on widely available hydrocarbons for clean power generation to realize a sustainable future. \u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3-\u03b4 (BZCY4) has been widely considered to be a promising electrolyte material for H+-SOFC, but it is restricted to commercial applications due to its poor densification behavior. A dense BZCY4 pellet was obtained by sintering at 1250\u00b0C after impregnating the material with a zinc nitrate solution. The dilatometer curves and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated that the sinterability of the BZCY4 material is effectively improved by impregnating the green membrane with 4wt% Zn. Moreover, EDX mapping indicated that the Ba, Zr and Ce elements were homogeneously distributed in the BZCY4+4wt% Zn sample sintered at 1250\u00b0C. In addition, an integrated SOFC employing a BZCY4+4wt% Zn electrolyte was successfully fabricated without any cracks and delamination by impregnating the BZCY4 electrolyte membrane with zinc nitrate as a sintering aid. This single cell with a 25mm thick BZCY4+4wt% Zn electrolyte membrane exhibited power densities as high as 360 and 276mWcm-2 at 700 and 600\u00b0C, respectively.

Pure phase LiFePO 4 was obtained at an optimal glycine to LiFePO 4 ratio of 4:1. To further increase the electrode performance, sucrose is applied as an organic carbon source. The introduction of sucrose after the auto-combustion is found to be the most effective way in improving electrode performance. The as-synthesized LiFePO 4/C sample contained about 2.86 wt.% carbon shows an attractive discharge capacity of about 160 mA h g -1 at a 0.1 C rate and retains a capacity of 110 mA h g -1 at a 5 C rate. In addition, the electrodes show excellent cycling performance during the 90 cycles at various rates. The rate limiting step for the electrode reaction is explored with the chronoamperometry technique and it demonstrates the surface kinetics is effectively improved for the LiFePO 4 electrode modified with a proper amount of carbon. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the electrical conductivity of the SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SrScCo) electrode, a composite of 70 wt% SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and 30 wt% Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SrScCo + SmSrCo) was prepared and investigated for electrochemical oxygen reduction at intermediate temperatures. The phase reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo and its effect on the electrical conductivity, oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen mobility were examined by XRD, 4-probe DC conductivity measurement, iodometry titration and O 2 -TPD experiment, respectively. The results showed that the composite reached a maximum conductivity around 123 S cm \u22121 at 600 \u00b0C, nearly five times that of SrScCo. AC impedance results showed that the electron charge-transfer process was greatly improved by forming the composite electrode, while the oxygen-ion charge-transfer process was somewhat deteriorated. By firing at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h, a SOFC with the SrScCo + SmSrCo cathode and thin-film SDC electrolyte delivered peak power densities of 1100 and 366 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively, which were only modestly lower than those of a similar cell with a pure SrScCo cathode. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cell Composite electrode Oxygen non-stoichiometry Oxygen mobility SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 1 Introduction It is generally believed that the widespread commercialization of solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology can be greatly accelerated if its operation temperature is successfully reduced from traditionally around 1000 \u00b0C to the range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C without severe impact on the cell power output. This is because the intermediate-temperature operation allows cheaper stainless steel as interconnecting materials, more elegant sealing and better thermal management, and prolongs lifetime by significantly reducing the rate of interfacial reactions between cell components [1,2] . The main obstacle in the development of an intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) is the poor activity of traditional cathodes for oxygen reduction, which leads to poor cell performance at reduced temperatures [3\u20135] . The development of new cathode materials with high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen-reduction reaction at intermediate temperatures is then of great importance and it has received considerable attention during the past decade [6,7] . The cathodic reaction involves the reduction of molecular oxygen to oxygen ion via a series of intermediate steps, including gas diffusion, surface adsorption, dissociation, charge transfer and so on [8,9] . High activation energy of 80\u2013350 kJ mol \u22121 is typically observed for such a reduction process [10\u201315] . As a result, a sharp increase in cathodic polarization resistance with reducing operating temperature was frequently observed. One typical example is oxygen reduction over the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) electrode, in which the charge-transfer reaction is limited to the triple phase boundary (TPB) where the electrode, the electrolyte and the gas phase (air) meet [16,17] . If the electrode possesses mixed-conducting capability, the oxygen-reduction reaction sites extend to the entire cathode surface because the oxygen ions can diffuse through the electrode bulk towards the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface in addition to the surface diffusion paths [18\u201321] . Consequently, electrocatalytic activity of the cathode towards oxygen reduction at reduced temperatures can be significantly improved [20,13] . The ionic conducting channels can be created by introducing a second phase to form a composite electrode, or the electrode intrinsically possesses ionic conducting capability [4,6\u20138,22\u201325] . Recently we reported a new mixed-conducting perovskite-type oxide SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3-\u03b4 (SrScCo) as a potential cathode material of IT-SOFC. An area specific resistance (ASR) as low as 0.206 \u03a9 cm 2 was obtained at 550 \u00b0C based on a symmetric cell test [13] . However, one serious drawback of the SrScCo electrode may be its poor electrical conductivity. Under ambient atmosphere, a maximum electrical conductivity of 40 S cm \u22121 was observed [26] . Under polarization, the electrical conductivity could even be much lower. As a cathode of SOFC, for efficient current collection, the electrical conductivity is preferred to be higher than 100 S cm \u22121 [27] . The poor electrical conductivity may introduce large contact resistance, especially if it is applied in a large cell stack. In order to increase the electrical conductivity, we can incorporate an electrical conducting phase into the SrScCo matrix to form a composite electrode. Previously, we have adopted LaCoO 3 as the electrical conducting phase in trying to increase the electrical conductivity of a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF)-based electrode [14] . Because LaCoO 3 is a purely an electron conductor, a reduction in the apparent ionic conductivity of the electrode is expected. In order to increase the electrical conductivity of SrScCo electrode without severe impair on the ionic conductivity, the formation of a composite electrode by introducing a mixed-conducting oxide Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SmSrCo) with high electrical conductivity was tried in this study [28] . The phase reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo and its impact on the electrical conductivity, oxygen vacancy concentration, oxygen mobility and activity of the composite electrode for oxygen reduction were investigated in detail. The performances of a single cell with various electrode materials were studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication All the composite oxides, including Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC), SrScCo, SmSrCo and Sm 0.13 Sr 0.87 Sc 0.15 Co 0.85 O 3-\u03b4 (SSSC) were synthesized by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. Analytic reagents of Sc 2 O 3 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 and Sm(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O were applied as the raw materials. For a typical synthesis, the required amounts of metal ions were first mixed into a solution, EDTA and citric acid were then added to serve as the complexing agents with the molar ratio of total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid set at 1:1:2, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to around 6 by using NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O. After the evaporation of water under heating, a transparent purple gel was obtained, which was then pre-treated at 240 \u00b0C to form a solid precursor and calcined at 900 \u00b0C in air for 5 h to obtain the targeted composite oxide. Symmetric cell configuration was used for evaluating the electrode performance for oxygen-reduction. SDC electrolyte pellets were fabricated by die pressing, followed by sintering at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. Electrode slurry was prepared by ball milling the electrode material with a liquid composed of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol at 400 rpm for 30 min. It was then painted onto each side of the SDC electrolyte pellets and calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. Silver paste covered the entire surfaces of the electrode to act as the current collector. Silver wires were fixed to the electrode by silver paste to perform as the leads. Anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cells were adopted for the single-cell test. Anode powders consisting of 60 wt% NiO and 40 wt% SDC were prepared through the mechanical mixing of NiO and SDC in an agate mortar. To fabricate the single cell, the well-mixed anode powder was firstly pressed as a substrate with the pressure of 150 MPa, Subsequently about 0.02 g SDC powder was added onto the substrate and pressed again to form a bi-layer pellet at 300 MPa. The bi-layer pellets were then fired under stagnant air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h. The cathode layer was fabricated onto the SDC electrolyte surface by spray-deposition followed by calcinations at various temperatures for 2 h in air. The thicknesses of the anode and cathode are \u223c300 \u03bcm and \u223c20 \u03bcm, respectively. Silver paste and silver wires were also adopted as the current collector and current lead, respectively. For oxygen permeation or electrical conductivity measurement purposes, disk-shape ceramic membranes or bar-shape pellets made of selected electrode materials were fabricated by die pressing followed by sintering at high temperatures. About 0.68 g oxide powder prepared from the calcination at 900 \u00b0C was pressed into disk-shape or bar-shape pellets in a stainless steel die at a pressure of 300 MPa. The SmSrCo, SrScCo and SSSC pellets were then sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. The relative density of the pellets was always higher than 95% as measured by Archimedes liquid displacement method. For electrical conductivity measurement, the pellet of SrScCo + SmSrCo composite was also prepared and sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h. 2.2 Oxygen permeation test Oxygen permeation through SrScCo, SmSrCo and SSSC membranes was measured by the gas chromatograph method. The as-sintered membranes with a diameter of 12\u201313 mm were polished to a thickness of \u223c0.85 mm by attrition paper and then sealed onto a dense quartz tube. The effective surface area of the membrane at the sweep side for permeation study was around 0.45 cm 2 . Helium was used as the sweep gas at a flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The permeated oxygen was conducted to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph for composition analysis. The amount of permeated oxygen can be calculated based on the helium flow rate and the oxygen concentration in the effluent gas. 2.3 Iodometry titration The iodometric titration was used to determine the average cobalt valency and the oxygen vacancy concentration (\u03b4) in SmSrCo, SrScCo and SrScCo + SmSrCo. Initially, about 0.1 g of the sample was accurately weighed and placed in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask, which was filled with flowing nitrogen gas to prevent the oxidation of I \u2212 ions by air. Then 3 g of KI and 5 ml of 1 M HCl aqueous solution were added in sequence. The following reaction (Eq. (1) ) occurred. (1) Co ( 2 + x ) + + x I \u2212 = Co 2 + + x 2 I 2 where 2 + x expresses the effective oxidation level of cobalt by the theorem of charge neutrality, also called the cobalt average valency for simplicity. A buffer solution consisting of NH 4 Ac and HAc was applied to adjust the final pH value of the solution to around 3.5. The liberated I 2 was then titrated with the standard thiosulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 3 ) solution of 0.02 mol L \u22121 with starch as the indicator. The following reaction happened during the titration. The average cobalt valency can be calculated based on the amount of S 2 O 3 2\u2212 consumed and the amount of oxide powder applied. (2) I 2 + 2 S 2 O 3 2 \u2212 = 2 I \u2212 + S 2 O 6 2 2.4 Electrochemical characterization The single-cell test was conducted over an in-lab constructed fuel cell test station 3% H 2 O humidified H 2 and ambient air were supplied as the fuel and the cathode atmosphere, respectively. I\u2013V polarization curves were collected by a digital electrometer (Model 2420, Keithley, USA). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the single cells or symmetric cells was measured under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. Impedance measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation based on a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer together with a Solartron 1287 Potentionstat/Galvanostat. The applied frequency was in the range of 0.1 mHz to 1 MHz, and the voltage amplitude was 10 mV. 2.5 Other characterizations The crystal structures of the synthesized composite oxides, or the reaction products of SmSrCo and SrScCo, were analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). O 2 -TPD experiments were conducted on the home-constructed multipurpose temperature- programmed apparatus. About 0.15 g sample in the size of 40\u201360 mesh was dropped into a U-type quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. Argon was introduced from one end of the tube at the flow rate of 15 ml min \u22121 [STP], and the temperature was programmatically increased from room temperature to 930 \u00b0C. The oxygen in the oxide lattice was progressively released, which was carried out by the flowing argon to a mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC-20, UK) for on-line oxygen concentration analysis. Occasionally, the temperature remained at 930 \u00b0C for sufficient time to allow the completion of the oxygen desorption process. The electrical conductivity was measured by the 4-probe DC conductivity technique. Silver paste was painted on the endpoints of the rectangle and along the rectangular edges of the bar-shape pellets to form current and voltage electrodes. Two silver wires acted as current contacts and the other two silver wires acted as the voltage contacts and were attached to the electrodes after pre-treatment at 180 \u00b0C for 1 h. The current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage was detected by a digital source meter (Keithley 2420, USA) at intervals of 10 \u00b0C over the temperature range of 900\u2013300 \u00b0C in air with a cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . At each temperature step, sufficient time was allowed for conductivity stabilization. The conductivity was calculated by the following relationship: (3) \u03c3 = 1 R \u00d7 l S where l , S and R represent the length, the cross-section area and DC resistance, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase reaction Regarding the composite electrode, phase reaction between the electrode components is a big concern for practical application. It may be beneficial or detrimental to the electrode performance, depending on the type and degree of the reaction [29,30] . In order to make the electrode layer firmly adhered to the electrolyte surface and the well connection between the electrode particles to minimize the contacting resistance during the fuel cell fabrication, the cell with the electrode layer should be fired at a temperature usually above 900 \u00b0C. However, it is well known that many cobalt-containing perovskite oxides have high reactivity with other cell components at such high temperatures. For example, we have previously demonstrated that BSCF can react with SDC and LaCoO 3 at temperatures above 900 \u00b0C [10,14] . To investigate the possible phase reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo oxides at high temperatures, they were mixed in powder form at a weight ratio of 7\u20133 and then calcined at various temperatures between 950 and 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. Shown in Fig.\u00a01 are the X-ray diffraction patterns of the mixed powder after the various high-temperature calcinations. For comparison, the X-ray diffraction patterns of pure SmSrCo and SrScCo are also presented. Both SmSrCo and SrScCo oxides demonstrated a phase-pure perovskite structure, and their diffraction peaks can be indexed well based on orthorhombic and cubic lattice symmetry, respectively. For the mixed powder after the calcination at 950 \u00b0C, its diffraction peaks can be roughly indexed based on a mixture of two perovskite oxides with different lattice parameters. All of the diffraction peaks of the perovskite with the larger lattice parameter matched well with those of the SrScCo phase, thus becoming assigned to the SrScCo-related phase, while the other peaks are assigned to the SmSrCo-related phase. With increasing calcination temperature, the intensity of the SmSrCo-related phase steadily decreased and almost disappeared after the calcination at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. All of the diffraction peaks of the composite oxide can be indexed well based on a single-phase perovskite with cubic lattice symmetry and the unit cell constant similar to that of SrScCo. Thus suggests that the solid-state reaction between SmSrCo and SrScCo was likely completed with the formation of a new perovskite with a similar lattice parameter to that of SrScCo after the calcination at 1100 \u00b0C. To support this assumption, a new oxide with the nominal composition of Sm 0.13 Sr 0.87 Sc 0.15 Co 0.85 O 3-\u03b4 (SSSC), which had the same cation ratio as the SrScCo + SmSrCo mixture of this study, was synthesized. The new oxide demonstrated a pure phase perovskite structure with cubic lattice symmetry. Shown in Fig.\u00a01 , the diffraction peaks of SSSC matched fairly well with those of the SrScCo + SmSrCo oxide calcined at 1100 \u00b0C. 3.2 Oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen mobility For the mixed-conducting electrode, its performance for oxygen reduction is closely related to the ionic conductivity. If oxygen vacancy is the charge carrier for the oxygen ion, which is the case for SrScCo and SmSrCo, the oxygen ionic conductivity is determined by the oxygen vacancy concentration and the oxygen mobility inside the oxide lattice according to the famous Nernst\u2013Einstein equation [31] , (4) \u03c3 o = D o C o q o 2 k T where D o represents the self-diffusivity of the oxide ion, C o is the concentration of oxide ion and q o is the charge of the oxygen ion. The oxygen vacancy concentration of the oxides is dependent on the average oxidation state of the cobalt ion. The average oxidation state of cobalt ion in SrScCo, SmSrCo and SrScCo + SmSrCo composite after calcinations at various temperatures for 5 h is then titrated by iodometry method with the results listed in Table 1 . For SrScCo oxide, the measured average oxidation state of Co is +2.91, in good agreement with our previous report [13] . It is 3.21 for cobalt in SmSrCo, suggesting that the cobalt in SmSrCo prefers to remain at a higher oxidation state. This could be explained by the smaller ionic size of Sm 3+ (0.124 \u00c5) than that of Sr 2+ (0.158 \u00c5). In order to maintain the perovskite lattice structure, the cobalt ion should remain at a smaller cation size to meet the requirement of the A-site cations. Assuming no phase reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo, the cobalt in SrScCo + SmSrCo composite should have an average oxidation state of 3.007. According to the results in Table 1 , the phase reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo did not result in an obvious change of the average oxidation state of cobalt in SrScCo + SmSrCo composites. For all the samples calcined at various temperatures the average cobalt ion oxidation state was located within the narrow range of 3.00\u20133.04. This suggests that the oxygen vacancy concentrations in SrScCo + SmSrCo composite calcined at different temperatures are similar to each other. O 2 -TPD is a facile technique to qualitatively analyze the oxygen mobility within the lattice and the reducibility of the cobalt ions. It is well known that the cobalt ion can occupy multiple oxidation states in a perovskite structure. With the programmatic increase of the temperature under an inert atmosphere, the reduction of the cobalt ions to a lower oxidation state could be thermally induced. To maintain electrical neutrality, the oxidation of O 2\u2212 to molecular oxygen should occur simultaneously with the creation of additional oxygen vacancies. The successful reduction of cobalt ions to a lower oxidation state should satisfy two basic requirements. Firstly, the reduction of cobalt ions to a lower oxidation state should be thermodynamically favorable; secondly, the oxide should have a certain level of oxygen ionic conductivity. Higher oxygen-ion mobility leads to lower expected initial oxygen release temperature. On the other hand, easier reduction of cobalt ion indicates that a larger amount of oxygen should be released. Shown in Fig.\u00a02 are the O 2 -TPD profiles of SrScCo + SmSrCo mixture powder calcined at various temperatures for 5 h. For comparison, the profiles of the pure phase SmSrCo and SrScCo are also presented. SmSrCo has the lowest initial temperature for the oxygen release among the tested materials. It suggests that the oxygen ion in SmSrCo has the highest mobility. However, it also has the smallest oxygen desorption peak area, suggesting that the Co 4+ in SmSrCo has the highest stability. In connection with the low initial oxygen non-stoichiometry of the oxide, the relatively low oxygen vacancy concentration may be the decisive factor in determining the electrochemical activity of SmSrCo electrode for oxygen reduction. For the SrScCo + SmSrCo composite oxide, the oxygen desorption peak areas are comparable after the calcination at various temperatures, suggesting that the phase reaction did not induce any obvious variation in oxygen vacancy concentration inside the oxide lattice, agreeing well with the iodometry results. However, the increase of the calcination temperature resulted in the shift of the oxygen desorption peak to a higher temperature, indicating the lowering of oxygen mobility with the increase of calcination temperature. Reduced electrode performance should then be expected with the phase reaction. To further evaluate the overall effect of the phase reaction on the ionic conductivity of the composite electrode, the oxygen permeation through membranes made from SrScCo, SmSrCo and SSSC (the final reaction product between SmSrCo and SrScCo) were measured. The oxygen permeation flux of the dense membranes is determined by the oxygen bulk diffusion rate and the surface exchange kinetics. For a reasonable comparison, the oxides were fabricated into membranes with the same membrane thickness of 0.85 mm, and all membranes were polished with a SiC attrition paper to create the similar surface morphology. During the measurement, ambient air was applied as the oxygen-rich side atmosphere while helium at a sweep rate of 100 ml min \u22121 [STP] was adopted as the oxygen-lean side atmosphere. As shown in Fig.\u00a03 a , SrScCo membrane had the highest oxygen permeation fluxes, followed by SSSC and then SmSrCo. If one assumes that the oxygen bulk diffusion is the rate-limiting step for oxygen permeation through the membranes, the average ionic conductivity can be calculated based on the oxygen permeation flux and the oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere. Fig.\u00a03 b clearly shows that the ionic conductivity of SSSC is higher than that of SmSrCo but lower than that of SrScCo. 3.3 Electrical conductivity Shown in Fig.\u00a04 are the electrical conductivity of SmSrCo, SrScCo and SSSC calcined at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h, as well as that of SrScCo + SmSrCo composite (7:3 in weight ratio) after calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h. The conductivity of the composite was corrected by the porosity because it remains porous in nature after the calcination at 1000 \u00b0C. It reached 25 S cm \u22121 at 600 \u00b0C for SrScCo. The increase of the electrical conductivity with temperature suggests the semiconductor conduction behavior for electron transport through SrScCo perovskite. As mentioned, the low electrical conductivity is the main drawback of a SrScCo electrode. SmSrCo demonstrated very high conductivity in air. It reached a value of 1630 S cm \u22121 at 400 \u00b0C. A steady decrease of the conductivity with increasing temperature was also observed, demonstrating the metallic conduction behavior of the electrical conduction in SmSrCo, in good agreement with the literature results [32] . As mentioned previously, the complete reaction between SmSrCo and SrScCo formed a new perovskite SSSC. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 , the electrical conductivity of SrScCo + SmSrCo composite oxide calcined at 1000 \u00b0C matched well with the SSSC oxide. A value of 123 S cm \u22121 was reached at 600 \u00b0C for SrScCo + SmSrCo composite, which is about five times that of SrScCo (25 S cm \u22121 ). It suggests that the introduction of a mixed-conducting phase is an effective way of improving the electrical conductivity of the SrScCo electrode. The much higher conductivity of SSSC than SrScCo can be explained by the fact that the average oxidation state of cobalt ion in the composite (+3.05) is higher than that in SrScCo (+2.91). The electron conduction in oxides usually takes place by the \u201csmall polaron mechanism\u201d through electron hopping along the B \u2013 O \u2013 B channel via a mechanism named the Zerner double exchange, as listed below. (5) B n + \u2212 O 2 \u2212 \u2212 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + \u2212 O \u2212 \u2212 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + \u2212 O 2 \u2212 \u2212 B n + The electron conduction is highly influenced by the overlapping between the O 2p and the transition metal 3-d orbitals. The extent of the overlap strongly depends on the B \u2013 O distance and the B \u2013 O \u2013 B angle. Due to the similar cubic lattice symmetry, there is no large difference in the B \u2013 O \u2013 B angle between SSSC and SrScCo oxides. The higher oxidation state of cobalt in SSSC than that in SrScCo ensures a higher extent of the overlap between the O 2p and the cobalt 3-d orbitals, thereby ensuring an easier Zerner double exchange. It in part accounts for the higher conductivity of SSSC than SrScCo. Because Sc 3+ has a fixed oxidation state, the presence of Sc 3+ at the B-site of perovskite would inhibit the Zenner double exchange. It is one of the main reasons for the relatively low conductivity of SrScCo oxide. Because phase reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo resulted in the decreased Sc concentration in the B-site of the perovskite, it then additionally contributed to the conductivity of SSSC being higher than that of SrScCo. 3.4 Electrode performance As demonstrated previously, the formation of SrScCo + SmSrCo composite electrode resulted in the substantial increase of electrical conductivity as compared to SrScCo however, the oxygen ionic conductivity is decreased due to the reduced oxygen mobility. To exploit the effect of SmSrCo incorporation and the phase reaction on the electrochemical performance of the SrScCo electrode for oxygen-reduction reaction, the electrode performance of the SrScCo + SmSrCo composite for oxygen reduction was first investigated by EIS based on a symmetric cell test with SDC as the electrolyte. Shown in Fig.\u00a05 a are the Nyquist plots of the EIS of SrScCo + SmSrCo composite at 600 \u00b0C. For comparison, the EIS data of SrScCo and SmSrCo are also presented. All of the electrodes were fabricated onto the electrolyte at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h. The difference between the real axis intercepts of the impedance plot is considered to be the electrode polarization resistance ( R p ). SrScCo showed the lowest electrode polarization resistance among the others, followed by SrScCo + SmSrCo composite electrode and then SmSrCo electrode. The sequence coincides with the ionic conductivity of the oxides fairly well. It suggests that the oxygen ionic conductivity play a significant role in the oxygen reduction over the SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 -based electrodes, as investigated in this study. To further exploit the effect of SmSrCo incorporation on the electrode performance, all of the spectra were well separated into two semi cycles based on an equivalent circuit with a configuration of LR ohm ( R E1 \u2212 CPE 1 )( R E2 \u2212 CPE 2 ), as shown in Fig.\u00a05 b, where R ohm is the overall ohmic resistance; L is the inductance; CPE is a constant phase element. This suggests that the oxygen-reduction reaction over the electrodes could be composed of at least two different processes. It is generally believed in literature that the resistance at the high frequency is associated with the charge-transfer processes ( R E1 ), including the electron-transfer and ion-transfer processes occurring at the current collector/electrode and the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, respectively, while the low frequency arc is attributed to the diffusion processes ( R E2 ), including adsorption\u2013desorption of oxygen, oxygen diffusion at the gas-cathode surface interface and surface diffusion of intermediate oxygen species [33,34] . The fitted values of R E1 and R E2 for SmSrCo, SrScCo and SrScCo + SmSrCo electrodes are shown in Fig.\u00a06 a&b. It was found that R E1 is much larger than R E2 for the SrScCo electrode. In connection with our previous results, the electron charge-transfer process is the primary step in controlling the oxygen reduction over SrScCo electrode [26] . For SmSrCo electrode, R E1 is slightly smaller than R E2 . It suggests that the surface process contributed more to the polarization resistance for oxygen reduction over the SmSrCo electrode. Because of the ultra-high electrical conductivity of SmSrCo, the electron charge-transfer kinetics should be sufficiently high in SmSrCo electrode; therefore the main value of R E1 is contributed from the oxygen ionic charge-transfer process. The only slightly lower R E1 than R E2 suggests that the ionic charge-transfer process also induced a noticeable polarization resistance for oxygen reduction over SmSrCo electrode. This may be related to its relatively poor oxygen ionic conductivity, as demonstrated by the oxygen permeation study. Similarly, Fukunaga et\u00a0al. demonstrated that the rate-limiting step for oxygen reduction over SmSrCo is the adsorption\u2013desorption process at the surface of the electrode by adopting dense SmSrCo on SDC electrolyte [35] . Regarding the SrScCo + SmSrCo composite electrode, R E1 was found to be much smaller than R E2 , suggesting great improvement of the charge-transfer process by incorporating SmSrCo into the SrScCo matrix. This can be explained by the increased electrical conductivity of the electrode as demonstrated previously. However, the absolute value of the R E1 for SrScCo + SmSrCo composite is comparable to that of SrScCo. This can be explained by the simultaneous increase in ionic charge-transfer resistance alongside with the improvement in electron charge-transfer process by introducing the SmSrCo phase. 3.5 Single-cell performance To demonstrate the potential application of SrScCo + SmSrCo composite as an electrode in a real fuel cell, Ni + SDC anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cell was fabricated by dual dry pressing followed by sintering at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h. SrScCo + SmSrCo was adopted as the cathode. For comparison, SrScCo and SmSrCo were also evaluated as the cathode materials. Shown in Fig.\u00a07 are the I\u2013V polarization curves of the cells with SrScCo + SmSrCo electrode. Very high cell performance was achieved, with a peak power density of 1100 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. It also reached about 366 mW cm \u22122 at 500 \u00b0C ( Fig.\u00a07 a). Such results are only modestly lower than these of a fuel cell with SrScCo electrode ( Fig.\u00a07 b) but much higher than these of a fuel cell with SmSrCo electrode ( Fig.\u00a07 c). Although the fuel cell performance is modestly lower for the cell with the SrScCo + SmSrCo electrode as compared to that of the cell with pure SrScCo electrode, the much higher electrical conductivity of SrScCo + SmSrCo than SrScCo suggests that it is preferable for practical application. Previously we have found that for the electrode with poor electrical conductivity, the current collecting method has a significant influence on the electrode performance. For example, with BSCF electrode, the peak power density can vary by a factor of 40 depending on the current collection method [36] . Because of its greatly improved electrical conductivity, the SrScCo + SmSrCo may be more suitable for larger cell application. Shown in Fig.\u00a08 is the EIS of the cell with SrScCo + SmSrCo electrode under OCV conditions. Here, the electrode polarization resistance is a sum of the anode and the cathode. A low value of 0.053 \u03a9 cm 2 was obtained at 600 \u00b0C, and 0.27 \u03a9 cm 2 at 500 \u00b0C. The results are even lower than those of the SrScCo + SmSrCo electrode measured under symmetric cell test ( Fig.\u00a05 a), suggesting that the electrode performance was improved by the asymmetric cell conditions. 4 Conclusions SmSrCo is a mixed-conducting oxide with ultra-high electrical conductivity. Its incorporation into the SrScCo electrode to form composite electrode effectively increased the electrical conductivity of the electrode and solved the problem of low electrical conductivity of SrScCo. The composite electrode showed an electrical conductivity of around 123 S cm \u22121 at 600 \u00b0C, which is nearly five times that of SrScCo. Solid-state reaction between SrScCo and SmSrCo occurred at temperatures above 900 \u00b0C. This reaction did not induce an obvious change of the oxygen vacancy concentration of the electrode, Instead it resulted in reduced oxygen mobility within electrode. Even so, the newly formed compound still had higher oxygen mobility than SmSrCo. The incorporation of SmSrCo significantly improved the electron charge-transfer process. However, the ion charge-transfer process was somewhat impaired. By adopting 70 wt% SrScCo + 30 wt% SmSrCo composite as the oxygen-reduction electrode of a thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cell, peak power densities of 1100 and 366 mW cm \u22122 were achieved at 600 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively, which are only modestly lower than of a similar cell with pure SrScCo electrode. However, due to the significantly improved electrical conductivity, 70 wt% SrScCo + 30 wt% SmSrCo composite electrode are more promising than SrScCo as the cathode material of reduced temperature solid-oxide fuel cell with SDC electrolyte.

Ag paste and LaCoO 3 (LC) oxide are studied as current collection materials, and five different current collecting techniques are attempted. Cell performances are evaluated using a current-voltage test and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) based on two types of anode-supported fuel cells, i.e., NiO + SDC|SDC|BSCF and NiO + YSZ|YSZ|SDC|BSCF. The cell with diluted Ag paste as the current collector exhibits the highest peak power density, nearly 16 times that of a similar cell without current collector. The electrochemical characteristics of the BSCF cathode with different current collectors are further determined by EIS at 600 \u00b0C using symmetrical cells. The cell with diluted Ag paste as the current collector displays the lowest ohmic resistance (1.4 \u03a9 cm 2 ) and polarization resistance (0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 ). Meanwhile, the surface conductivities of various current collectors are measured by a four-probe DC conductivity technique. The surface conductivity of diluted Ag paste is 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than that of LC or BSCF. The outstanding surface conductivity of silver may reduce the contact resistance at the current collector/electrode interface and, thus, contributes to better electrode performance. Keywords Current collector Barium strontium cobalt ferrite Surface conductivity Solid oxide fuel cells Electrode performance 1 Introduction In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the development of alternative energy sources because petroleum reserves are believed to be exhausted in the next few decades. As high-temperature electrochemical energy conversion devices with advantageous features of high efficiency, low emissions and fuel flexibility, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have attracted particular attention from both the public and research community to create a more sustainable future [1\u20133] . The reduction of the operation temperature from the convention of approximately 1000 \u00b0C to the intermediate temperature range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C is critical to accelerating the commercialization of this fascinating technology because many drawbacks associated with high-temperature operation can be eliminated. However, a quick increase in polarization resistance with the drop in operation temperature is often observed for the conventional La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathode. This transition occurs due to the large activation energy associated with the oxygen reduction process (typically greater than 120 kJ mol \u22121 ) and the small amount of active sites for oxygen reduction limited to the narrow region of electrolyte\u2013electrode\u2013air triple phase boundary (TPB) [4,5] . Currently, the cathode has become the major obstacle in realizing the lower temperature operation of SOFCs. The cathode performance is closely related to its material composition. By applying mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conducting oxides as the electrodes, the active sites for oxygen reduction can potentially extend from the typical TPB region to the entire exposed cathode surface; this adjustment could lead to an enhanced activity for oxygen reduction at reduced temperatures. At present, considerable research efforts aim to develop innovative materials possessing both high surface activity and bulk oxygen ionic conductivity as cathodes of SOFCs [6\u201310] . Meanwhile, the electrode performance is intimately related to the electrode microstructure, which can influence both the gas diffusion and charge transfer processes. In 2004, Shao et al. first reported the application of a perovskite-type Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) mixed conducting oxide as a cathode of intermediate-temperature (IT)-SOFCs on a thin-film samarium doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte [11] . BSCF shows an extraordinarily high oxygen vacancy concentration, which results in a high oxygen bulk diffusion rate and surface exchange kinetics, both of which are beneficial for the oxygen reduction reaction. The reports describe very low electrode area specific resistance (ASR) from symmetric cell tests and high cell power output for an anode-supported fuel cell with a thin-film SDC electrolyte (20 \u03bcm) and BSCF cathode. Inspired by the outstanding performance, many researchers have studied the properties and performance of BSCF, including its phase structure, oxygen nonstoichiometry, phase stability, and performance in a single cell [12\u201317] . However, as listed in Table 1 [11,15,18\u201327] , large deviations in the values of cell power outputs and/or ASRs were demonstrated in literature, though their cell configuration and fabrication processes are similar. For example, Shao et al. reported a maximum peak power density of 1010 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C for an anode-supported cell with a 20-\u03bcm thick SDC electrolyte and BSCF cathode, while Yan et al. obtained a value of only 840 mW cm \u22122 at the same temperature for similar cells [11,15] . Meanwhile, ASR values of 0.072 \u03a9 cm 2 and 0.51 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C were reported by Zhou et al. and Deng et al., respectively, though both were based on a two-electrode configuration [22,23] . Such discrepancies are hardly explainable by the difference in electrode microstructures. Understanding the origin of such large differences is significant for further optimization of electrode performance and for practical application. Because oxygen reduction processes involve electron transportation, the electrode is required to be electronically conductive. BSCF has relatively low electrical conductivity. A dense-type BSCF has a maximum conductivity value of only 40\u201350 S cm \u22121 in the intermediate temperature range (500\u2013800 \u00b0C) in air, and this value is further reduced to only approximately 10 S cm \u22121 under a nitrogen atmosphere ( P O 2 \u223c 10 \u2212 5 \u2009 atm ) [28] . As a practical electrode of SOFCs, BSCF possesses a porosity of 20\u201350%, which may substantially reduce the apparent conductivity when compared to dense pellets. The electrical conductivity of a porous electrode could be at least one order of magnitude less than that of a dense pellet [29] . Although the current collector does not directly participate in the electrochemical process, inefficient current collection may introduce non-negligible contacting resistance and/or increase the charge transfer resistance noticeably, in particular under a large polarization current. In this study, the effect of the current collection material and method on the performance of BSCF electrodes was systematically investigated. Ag paste and LaCoO 3 (LC) oxide were specifically selected as the current collectors, and five different current-collecting techniques were studied. Significantly different electrode performances were demonstrated by both symmetric cell and single cell tests, suggesting that the discrepancies in the electrode performance of BSCF in the literature are likely related to the current collection problem. Adopting the proper current collection material and method is crucial to achieve the high performance of BSCF cathodes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis BSCF, LC and Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) were all synthesized by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process. The preparation of BSCF is given as an example. Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 y H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 y H 2 O were used as the raw materials for metal sources. Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 y H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 y H 2 O were first dissolved in de-ionized water to prepare aqueous solutions, and their precise concentrations were determined by an EDTA titration method. The detailed procedure can refer to our published paper [10,22] . The final calcination temperatures of BSCF, LC and SDC were 900, 950 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively. 2.2 Fabrication of symmetric and anode-supported cells The as-synthesized SDC powder was ball milled to reduce the amount of soft aggregates and fabricated into disk-shape pellets by dry pressing. Those green SDC pellets were sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The sintered SDC pellets with a diameter of approximately 13 mm were polished by an attrition paper to a thickness of 0.9 mm. A BSCF slurry, prepared by ball milling BSCF powder in a premixed solution of glycerol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol, was then deposited onto both surfaces of the SDC pellets by a spray deposition technique. The resulting cells were fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to obtain symmetrical cells with the configuration of BSCF|SDC|BSCF for impedance measurement. The fuel cells applied in this study were in the anode-supported, thin-film electrolyte configuration. Two types of fuel cells were fabricated: (1) NiO + SDC anode-supported fuel cell with SDC electrolyte and (2) NiO + YSZ|YSZ|SDC anode-supported fuel cell with YSZ and SDC dual-layer electrolyte. The NiO + SDC|SDC dual layer pellets were fabricated by a dry pressing and co-sintering technique. The detailed fabrication process was described previously [30] . The NiO + YSZ anode substrates were prepared by tape casting and punched into disk-shaped anode substrates with diameters of 16 mm, and then they were sintered at 1150 \u00b0C in air to remove organic materials. The YSZ electrolyte layer was prepared via wet powder spraying and sintering. The spraying process was carried out at 200 \u00b0C by heating the anode substrates over a hot paste. The obtained NiO + YSZ|YSZ green disks were sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. After sintering, the disks have a diameter of approximately 13 mm. Then the SDC thin-film electrolyte layer was prepared by the same wet powder spraying technique and sintered at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h, resulting in anode-supported, YSZ|SDC dual-layer electrolyte pellets. Finally, the BSCF slurry was deposited on the central surface of the two types of anode-supported SDC electrolytes by spray deposition, and the device was fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h. The cathode has a geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 . 2.3 Current collection Ag paste and LC oxide were studied as current collectors. All together, five different current collection techniques were investigated, including two different current collection methods for the Ag paste and two different techniques for LC oxide, as shown in Fig. 1 . In some studies, a silver wire was directly fixed to the central surface of the BSCF electrode by Ag paste; as the area of the Ag paste is very small (approximately 0.02 cm 2 ) compared to the geometric surface area of BSCF (0.48 cm 2 ), the resulting devices can be viewed as having no current collector applied (technique 1). To use Ag as a current collector, a dense Ag paste was applied to the material, which contained >80 wt.% silver powder that is balanced by organic additives. Two methods of the current collection were studied; the undiluted Ag paste was directly applied to the entire surface of BSCF electrode by painting (technique 2), or it was first diluted with ethanol with polyvinyl butyral (PVB) before applying it to the BSCF surface (technique 3). To apply LC as the current collector, it was deposited onto the BSCF electrode surface by painting and fired at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h to allow firm adhesion between LC and the BSCF layer while effectively suppressing the phase reaction between LC and BSCF [22] (technique 4). Also, the LC current collector surface was further modified with a layer of diluted Ag paste (technique 5). For techniques 2 through 5, silver wires were attached to the central electrode surface by Ag paste with a dot. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization The single cell test was conducted over an in-lab constructed fuel cell test station. During the measurement, H 2 was fed into the anode side as fuel at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP], while ambient air was the cathode atmosphere. I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected by a digital electrometer (Model 2420, Keithley, USA) in four-probe mode. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the single cells or symmetric cells were measured using an electrochemical workstation based on a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 Potentionstat/Galvanostat under open air circuit (OCV) conditions. The frequency range was 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV. 2.5 Other characterizations The electrical conductivity of BSCF and LC was measured by a four-probe DC conductivity technique. Approximately 1 g BSCF and LC powders were pressed into bars and sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. Undiluted Ag paste was painted on the square cross-sectional edges and two circumferential surfaces of the bar to form the current and voltage electrodes. Two silver wires acting as current contacts and two silver wires acting as voltage contacts were attached to the electrodes. The current was applied to the two current wires, and the voltage was detected by the digital electrometer (Model 2420, Keithley, USA) from 900 to 300 \u00b0C at intervals of 10 \u00b0C in air. The surface conductivity of the porous BSCF cathode, LC current collector and Ag paste collector was also tested using the same four-probe DC conductivity technique, as described above. Details can be found in literatures [31,32] . In this experiment, the BSCF or LC slurries were sprayed onto SDC electrolytes and fired at 1000 and 950 \u00b0C for 2 h, respectively. The diluted Ag paste was applied onto the SDC electrolyte with a brush, and the device was fired at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h. The electrical contact for the current and voltage probes was made with very small amounts of undiluted Ag paste. Measurements were carried out in air in the temperature range of 450 and 700 \u00b0C. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the symmetric cells were observed by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-200). 3 Results 3.1 Single cell performance The current collector is an important component of the fuel cell system that collects the current from the anode or distributes the current homogenously over the cathode. A potential material for current collectors should satisfy a number of different criteria, including good electrical conductivity, high thermal/chemical stability under operational conditions and low fabrication costs [33] . Silver, which has been often applied as the current collector for IT-SOFCs in lab investigation, has very high electrical conductivity (6.2 \u00d7 10 5 S cm \u22121 at room temperature); however, the long-term stability of silver may be still questionable. At the same time, some composite oxides with high electrical conductivities, such as LaNi 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3 and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 , are also applied as current collectors [34,35] . Zhou et al. have demonstrated that LaCoO 3 perovskite oxide has high electrical conductivity (approximately 700 S cm \u22121 ) at elevated temperatures in air [22] . Thus, Ag paste and LC were tried as the current collectors in this study. The effect of current collection methods on the single cell performance was first investigated. Two types of fuel cells are investigated: the NiO + SDC anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cell and the NiO + YSZ anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cell with a YSZ and SDC dual-layer electrolyte fuel cell. Fig. 2 presents I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the various anode-supported dual-layer electrolyte fuel cells with the same BSCF cathode and different current collection methods between 550 and 750 \u00b0C. All of the cells showed high open circuit voltages (OCVs), which are close to the predicted values from the Nernst equation, suggesting that the YSZ|SDC dual-layer electrolyte is dense and gas-tight. A significant impact of the current collection methods on the cell performance was clearly demonstrated from the results in Fig. 2 . For the cell without a current collector (technique 1), the peak power densities were only 77, 63, 48 and 31 mW cm \u22122 at 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. By applying LC as the current collector (technique 4), the cell performance significantly improved, and the peak power densities reached 211, 156, 106 and 69 mW cm \u22122 at 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. A further improvement in cell performance was demonstrated by adopting an LC-Ag current collector (technique 5), and the cell delivered peak power densities of 608, 363, 242 and 137 mW cm \u22122 at 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. The maximum power densities of 1240, 873, 517 and 299 mW cm \u22122 were obtained at 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively, for the cell with diluted Ag paste as the current collector (technique 3). By applying undiluted Ag paste as the current collector (technique 2), the peak power densities are 698, 546, 431 and 283 at 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. The noticeable difference in peak power densities of the cells with Ag paste as the current collectors (techniques 2 and 3) indicate that the cell performance is also influenced by the method of current collection. In this study, the maximum difference of peak power density among the cells with different current collection method is as large as factors of 16 and 10 at 750 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. The significant effects of the current collection material and technique on the cell performance were also demonstrated for the cell with a single layer SDC electrolyte. Table 2 lists the peak power densities of the various anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cells with the same BSCF cathode and different current collection methods at 600 \u00b0C. At 600 \u00b0C, the cell with diluted Ag paste, undiluted Ag paste, LC-Ag, LC and no current collector have peak power densities of 960, 697, 546, 227 and 30 mW cm \u22122 , respectively. Because the cells were fabricated and tested under the same conditions, the large variations in performance are mainly related to their different current collection materials or methods. The cell performance is influenced by the cell ohmic resistance and the electrode polarization resistance [36] . Fig. 3 shows the EIS in Nyquist plots of the NiO + YSZ|YSZ|SDC|BSCF cells with different types of current collectors under open circuit conditions at 600 \u00b0C. The cell resistance was significantly affected by the current collection material and also by the current collection technique. The cell with the diluted Ag paste shows the lowest ohmic and polarization resistances when compared to the other cells; the cell without a current collector shows the highest ohmic and polarization resistances. The cell with the LC-Ag paste has a lower ohmic and polarization resistance relative to the cells with LC or nothing as the current collector; however, its ohmic resistance and electrode polarization resistance are higher than those of the cells with diluted or undiluted Ag paste. The cell ohmic resistance contains the electrical resistances of the electrodes and the electrolyte, the contact resistance between the lead wire and the electrode, and the resistance of the lead wire [37] . Clearly, the difference in ohmic resistance for the different cells is mainly attributed to the contact resistance because there is no difference in the electrolyte, electrode or lead wires of the various cells. The electrode polarization resistance in the single cell is the sum of the anodic and cathodic polarization resistances. The fact that the anode is identical for the various cells suggests that the current collectors have strong effects on the BSCF cathode performance. 3.2 EIS To further illustrate the effects of different current collectors (method and material) on the electrochemical performance of the BSCF cathode, symmetrical cells with a BSCF cathode and various current collectors were fabricated and tested. Fig. 4 presents the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells with different types of cathode current collectors at an operating temperature of 600 \u00b0C. The measured results of total resistance ( R total ), ohmic resistance ( R ohmic ) and electrode polarization resistance ( R p ) are listed in Table 3 . Large differences are present in both R ohmic and R total by applying the different current collection materials and current collection techniques. R total , R ohmic and R p decreased in the sequence of silver dot, LC, LC-Ag, undiluted Ag paste and diluted Ag paste. The ohmic resistance of the cell with only the silver dot to fix the silver wire, which reaches as high as 23.3 \u03a9 cm 2 , is the highest. The cell with the LC current collector has an ohmic resistance of 12.7 \u03a9 cm 2 , which is only half of that of the cell with the silver dot. The ohmic resistance of the cell decreases to 2.3 \u03a9 cm 2 when the LC-Ag is applied as the current collector. Notably, the ohmic resistance of the cell with diluted Ag paste is reduced to only 1.4 \u03a9 cm 2 , while this value is 1.7 \u03a9 cm 2 when applying undiluted Ag paste as the current collector. As no differences in the electrolyte thickness are present, the ohmic resistance depends greatly on the contact resistance between the current collector and the cathode. These results indicate that using a proper current collector can lower the ohmic resistance of the cell, particularly the contact resistance between the cathode and the current collector. The cell with a silver dot shows the highest electrode polarization resistance (0.7 \u03a9 cm 2 ), and the cell with LC, LC-Ag and diluted Ag paste current collectors have electrode polarization resistances of 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 , respectively. The distinct behaviors of R ohmic and R p can be related to the different current collectors, suggesting that the current collectors not only affect the ohmic resistance of the cells but also the BSCF cathode polarization resistance. 3.3 Electrode morphology From EIS, the current collectors clearly have significant effects on the contact resistance and the electrode polarization resistance. To exploit the origin of such effects, the morphologies of the current collectors and the electrode were observed by SEM. Fig. 5 shows the surface and cross-sectional micrographs of the symmetrical cells with different current collectors. As shown in Fig. 5 a and b, the BSCF electrodes have similar highly porous structures, and the thicknesses of all of the cells are approximately 20 \u03bcm. The porous BSCF cathode shows good adhesion to the dense SDC pellet and has a homogeneous microstructure with well-contacted particles. This observation suggests that the differences in electrode and cell performance with different current collectors, as demonstrated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 , are not likely due to the microstructure and thickness of BSCF cathode. The LC current collector was more porous with a thickness of 17 \u03bcm, and the particle size of LC is smaller than that of BSCF. As shown in Fig. 5 c and d, the Ag current collector prepared with undiluted Ag paste is much less porous than that prepared by the diluted Ag paste. 3.4 Surface conductivity High electrical conductivity is important for the efficient current collection and the decrease of contact resistance between the current collector and electrode [33,38] . Therefore, in this study, we first measured the electrical conductivity of LC, which will be used as a current collector for the BSCF cathode. The values of the dense LC sample for the temperature from 300 to 900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 ; for comparison, the electrical conductivity of BSCF and the reported value of LC are also given. The electrical conductivity of LC oxide increases with temperature up to a maximum and then decreases with increasing temperature; these results agree well with our previous study by Zhou et al. [22] . For the BSCF sample, the electrical conductivity first increases linearly with temperature until 510 \u00b0C; above this temperature, this value remains almost constant with respect to further increases in temperature. The conductivities of BSCF are much lower than those of LC in the temperature range of 300\u2013900 \u00b0C. At 800 \u00b0C, for example, the conductivities of BSCF and LC are 31.6 and 679.5 S cm \u22121 , respectively; the electrical conductivity of LC is more than twenty times greater than that of BSCF at 800 \u00b0C. The results showed that LC has enough electrical conductivity to be applied as a current collector of a BSCF cathode. Although LC has very high electrical conductivity in a dense pellet, the electrode performance of the BSCF cathode with LC was worse than that of cells with diluted or undiluted Ag paste. As we know, the current collector layer should have enough porosity for gas diffusion; the electrical conductivity of LC will decrease with increasing porosity. To collect the current of the BSCF cathode effectively, the current collector should also have enough surface conductivity. Here we further investigated the surface conductivity of BSCF, LC, and diluted and undiluted Ag paste in the range of 450\u2013700 \u00b0C, and the values are shown in Fig. 7 . The surface conductivities of BSCF and LC increase with temperature, and the values are 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 at 700 \u00b0C, respectively. The surface conductivity of LC is only two times greater than that of BSCF, although the electrical conductivity of LC is twenty times than that of BSCF at 700 \u00b0C (shown in Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 7 c and d, the surface conductivity of Ag paste (diluted and undiluted) generally decreases with temperature, and the values of undiluted Ag paste are greater than that of diluted Ag paste at corresponding temperatures. The surface conductivity of undiluted and diluted Ag paste can reach 25.4 and 23.5 S cm \u22121 at 700 \u00b0C, respectively, which indicates that the surface conductivity is also affected by the porosity of material. Meanwhile, the value of Ag paste is two thousand times greater than that of LC or BSCF. 4 Discussion The choice of a proper current collector in an electrode has been identified as an important component, especially for the practical application of SOFCs due to the fact that an inadequate current collector will lead to large voltage losses in the SOFCs stack. In connection with the results in Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 and Table 2 , current collection material and method could significantly affect the ohmic and polarization resistances of the cells, thus, the outputs of single cells. Since the cells with different current collectors have the same anode, electrolyte and cathode, the difference in resistances may be affected by the current collectors. Therefore, symmetrical cells with BSCF cathodes and different current collectors were used to identify the origins of the effect of the current collection material and technique on the cell performance. As expected, shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3 , the R total , R ohmic and R p decreased, in the sequence, by applying LC, LC-Ag, undiluted Ag paste and diluted Ag paste as the current collector, and the decrease of R ohmic is dominant in R total . This observation indicated that the current collector affected not only the BSCF cathode polarization resistance but also the ohmic resistance of the cell. Usually, the oxygen-reduction reaction over the electrodes is regarded as a combination of charge-transfer processes and diffusion processes. The diffusion processes involve the adsorption and desorption of oxygen, oxygen diffusion at the gas\u2013cathode interface and the surface diffusion of intermediate oxygen species. The charge-transfer processes include both electron transfer and ion transfer processes, which occur at the current collector/electrode and electrode/electrolyte interfaces [39] . Because all of the symmetrical cells with different current collectors have the same BSCF electrode material and similar electrode microstructures and thicknesses (shown in Fig. 5 ), the variation in R p is less likely to originate in the diffusion processes. Different current collection materials and methods likely result in different electron transfer processes occurring at the current collector/electrode interface and, thus, different R p values. At the same time, the R p of the cell with undiluted Ag paste as current collector is still much higher than that of the cell with diluted Ag paste as current collector. The gas diffusion polarization resistance is likely non-negligible for the insufficient porosity of the diluted Ag paste current collector. This hypothesis may explain the differences in cell performances reported by different researchers [11,15] , though they applied similar cells with BSCF cathodes and Ag pastes as the current collectors. The ohmic resistance primarily includes the electrolyte resistance, electrode ohmic resistance and contact resistances at the cathode/electrolyte and cathode/current collector interfaces. As shown in Fig. 5 , the difference in ohmic resistance is less affected by the electrolyte resistance, electrode ohmic resistance, microstructure and thickness. Thus, assumedly, the decrease of ohmic resistance of the cell with diluted Ag paste is mainly due to the improved BSCF cathode/current collector interface. As can be seen from Fig. 6 , the electrical conductivity of dense LC is quite high, and the value at 800 \u00b0C can reach 679.5 S cm \u22121 , which is more than twenty times greater than that of BSCF. However, as shown in Fig. 7 , the surface conductivities of BSCF and LC were still low, and the values are only 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 , respectively, at 700 \u00b0C. The poor surface conductivity of the LC current collector may be ascribed to poor sintering that resulted from the relatively low firing temperature in this study. The surface conductivity of diluted Ag paste is 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than that of LC or BSCF, for example, the surface conductivity of diluted Ag paste can reach 23.5 S cm \u22121 at 700 \u00b0C. As mentioned, the increased surface conductivity of the current collector can lower the ohmic resistances of the current collector and at the BSCF/current collector interface. 5 Conclusions From this study, the electrochemical performance of anode-supported SOFCs with BSCF cathodes was highly sensitive to the current collection material and method. We believed the large differences in the literature results about BSCF electrodes are, at least in part, due to the different current collection materials and/or techniques. The current collector affected not only the polarization resistance of BSCF but also the ohmic resistance of the cells. Although LC is a good electronic conductor in a dense form, its surface conductivity is still low in a porous state fired at 950 \u00b0C; thus, LC is not an ideal current collector for BSCF. The surface conductivity of undiluted or diluted Ag paste is more than 2000 times greater than that of LC or BSCF, which enhanced the contact at the cathode/current collector interface. However, the improper fabrication of Ag current collectors could create insufficient porosity, which increases the electrode polarization resistance. To achieve high cell performance, the choice of a proper current material and method is highly crucial because these properties help to lower the ohmic resistance of the cell, particularly the contact resistance between the cathode and the current collector.

        "abstract": "A novel perovskite-type mixed-conducting oxide of SrSc 0.05Co0.95O3-\u03b4 (SSC) was synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing method. The 5 mol % of Sc3+ doping into the B-site of SrCoO3-\u03b4 (SC) through the sol-gel synthesis effectively stabilized the oxygen vacancy disordered cubic perovskite structure of the oxide, and simultaneously resulted in a substantial increase of the electrical conductivity. The oxide was fabricated into dense ceramic membrane for oxygen separation by pressing/sintering process. The oxygen permeation flux of the SSC membrdne and the rate-determination step of the permeation process were investigated between 750 and 900\u00b0C. The experimental results demonstrated that SSC is a promising membrane for oxygen separation with ultrahigh permeation fluxes, compared favorably with reported high oxygen semipermeable Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe 0.2O3-\u03b4 and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O 0.\u03b4 membrdnes under air/helium gradient. At the condition of reduced temperature and low oxygen partial pressure at the sweep side atmosphere, the permeation process was found to be rate-determined mainly by the slow oxygen surface exchange kinetics at the air (feed) side membrane surface based on the single cell oxygen permeation study. The activation energy for the oxygen surface exchange and oxygen bulk diffusion was found to be around 126 kJ mol-1 and \u226462.1 kJ mol-1, respectively. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.",

        "title": "Combustion synthesis of high-performance Li4Ti5O12 for secondary Li-ion battery",
        "abstract": "Spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was synthesized by a simple glycine-nitrate auto-combustion by applying aqueous medium and constricting the reactions in the pores of cellulose fibers. The products from the auto-combustion and further calcination at various temperatures were characterized by XRD, SEM, BET surface area and TEM examinations. Pure phase and well-crystallized nano-Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxides were obtained at a calcination temperature of 700 \u00b0C or higher. The 700 \u00b0C calcined one shows the best and high electrochemical performance, which reached a capacity of \u223c125 mAh/g at 10 C discharge rate with fairly stable cycling performance even at 40 \u00b0C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests demonstrated that the surface reaction kinetics of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was improved significantly with the increase of its electronic conductivity. Keywords Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 Combustion synthesis Cellulose Rate capacity 1 Introduction Nowadays, there are great interests in rechargeable batteries for application in hybrid electric vehicles and as renewable or dispersed energy storage systems, which typically require higher charge/discharge rates and bigger battery sizes, and emphasize more on the price, rate capacity and safety of the batteries. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are promising candidates due to its high energy and power densities [1\u20133] . State-of-the-art lithium secondary batteries compose of a graphite/carbon-related anode [4\u20136] , which has serious safety concerns for large-size applications. On the other hand, due to the low lithium intercalating voltage of approximately 100 mV (vs. Li/Li + ), highly reactive metallic lithium forms easily under fast charge rate, which will deposit on the surface of electrode particles and has the high risk to react with the electrolyte or highly charged cathodes. Furthermore, graphite/carbon-based anodes also suffer from a lack of a clear end-of-charge indicator in their voltage profiles [1] . Recently, spinel-related Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide, or written as Li[Li 1/3 Ti 5/3 ]O 4 , has been studied as an alternative candidate of anode in solid, liquid and gel Li-ion batteries [7\u201312] . It is cheap, and more importantly, features a unique lithium insertion/extraction mechanism that involves two phases (spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 and rocksalt-type Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 ) having the same symmetry with near zero change in the unit cell volume during the charge/discharge processes [13\u201318] . Such characteristics ensure an excellent cycling performance with a long cycling life. Moreover, it offers a discharge platform around 1.55 V versus Li + /Li, above the reduction potential of most organic electrolytes, consequently passive films with high resistances from the reduction of electrolytes (SEI) can be avoided on the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 surface [19,20] . This voltage is also sufficiently high for avoiding the formation of metallic lithium. The main obstacle of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is, however, its poor rate capacity. One effective way for the rate-performance enhancement is to reduce its particle size. Smaller particle size means shorter diffusion length and higher surface reaction sites, which would lead to improved lithium intercalation kinetics [21\u201333] . On the other hand, the surface modification is also effective for enhancing the surface reaction kinetics. Various kinds of surface coatings, such as oxides, carbon materials, polymers and conductive agents, have been exploited [34\u201338] . The low electronic conductivity of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 accounts in part for its poor rate performance. The doping strategy, on the purpose of improving the bulk electronic conductivity, and therefore, the performance of the anode at high charge/discharge rate, has also been extensively exploited [39\u201344] . So far, the spinel-type Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was mainly prepared by solid-state reactions of mechanically mixed anatase-type TiO 2 and Li 2 CO 3 or LiOH [7,13,15,16,45] . The reaction is usually conducted at 800\u20131000 \u00b0C for prolonged time. However, the long-distance diffusion during the solid-state reaction of the reactants results in low homogeneity, irregular morphology, big particle sizes, and poor control of stoichiometry of the product. Compared with the solid-state reaction, the methods of wet chemical synthesis such as sol\u2013gel, emulsion\u2013gel and hydrothermal can obviously reduce the temperature of the reaction. Thus, the particle size was decreased significantly and the electrochemical properties of their productions was improved accordingly [21\u201333] . It is noticeable that such wet chemical synthesis methods always require a non-aqueous medium, which, however, increases the cost. Furthermore, the crystallographic structure usually grows poorly at low calcination temperature. Recently, Raja et al. introduced a novel aqueous combustion technique using an amino acid alanine as fuel to synthesize nano-crystalline Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . However, a pure phase of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 cannot be obtained even after calcined at 800 \u00b0C for 10 h [46] . In this study, we report the synthesis of nano-sized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders via a facile glycine-nitrate combustion process by applying an aqueous medium and constricting the reactions within the pores of cellulose fibers (cellulose\u2013GN process). Pure phase and well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxides were obtained at calcination temperature as low as 700 \u00b0C. The as-derived anodes show excellent performance, especially, at high charge/discharge rate. Such nano-Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode will applied to high power lithium ion battery. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials synthesis The synthesis procedure of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powder is shown schematically in Fig. 1 . The de-waxed cotton was applied as the cellulose fiber [47\u201349] . It was immersed in 67 wt.% concentrated nitric acid for a certain time, and then washed with de-ionized water to remove the free HNO 3 and dried at \u223c100 \u00b0C to form the activated cellulose fiber. The synthesis of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is described as follows. Tetrbutyl titanate [Ti(C 4 H 9 O) 4 ] was slowly dropped into de-ionized water under ice-water bathing and vigorous stirring leading to the formation of white precipitate of TiO(OH) 2 . Nitric acid was then introduced under stirring to result in a transparent titanyl nitrate solution. Stoichiometric amount of LiNO 3 was added in, followed by the introduction of glycine as the fuel at the mole ratio of glycine: total metal ions of 3:1. The mixed solution was slowly soaked into the activated cellulose. After drying at 80 \u00b0C for several hours, the precursor was heated at 250 \u00b0C in an electrical oven to start the auto combustion. Fluffy Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 primary product was obtained, which has the morphological shape of the initial cellulose fiber and can be ground easily to fine powders. The primary was then further calcined at temperature between 500 and 900 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. Furthermore, as contrast, the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was also prepared by the solid-state route. The starting materials, Li 2 CO 3 (AR) and TiO 2 (anatase), were mixed by simple milling. Excess Li was provided to compensate for the loss of Li during synthesis. Samples were heated in a muffle furnace at various temperatures in order to form pure Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders. 2.2 Electrode fabrication The cells are based on the configuration of Li metal(\u2212)|electrolyte| Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (+) with a liquid electrolyte (1 M solution of LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) 1:1 in v/v). Microporous polypropylene film (Celgard, 2400) was used as the separator. The working electrode was prepared from a paste of 85 wt.% Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with 10 wt.% conductive Super P (NCM HERSBIT Chemical Co. Ltd., China) and 5 wt.% LA-132 binder (Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd., China) in de-ionized water to make viscous slurries for efficient deposition. The slurries were deposited on current collectors of copper foil (10 \u03bcm) by blading, which was pretreated by etching with 1 M nitric acid solutions followed by rinsing with water and then with acetone. Before electrochemical evaluation, the electrode was dried under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h. Cell assembly was conducted in a glove box filled with pure argon. 2.3 Basic analysis The crystal structures of the synthesized powders were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with filtered Cu k\u03b1 radiation. The crystalline size was calculated based on the Scherrer equation from the study of the Bragg angle and half bandwidth at the index peak of (1 1 1) plane of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The particle morphology was examined by Environmental Scanning Electronic Microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000) and Transmission Electronic Microscope (JEOL TEM 2011). The specific surface area of the samples was characterized by N 2 adsorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen using a BELSORP II instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were treated at 200 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 h in vacuum to remove the surface adsorbed species. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization The charge\u2013discharge characteristics of the cells were recorded over the potential range between 1.0 and 3.0 V using a NEWARE BTS 5V-50 mA computer-controlled Galvanostat (Shenzhen China) at different rates of 1\u201340 C at 30 \u00b0C. Cyclic voltammetry tests were performed over the potential range of 1.0\u20133.0 V using a Princeton Applied Research PARSTAT 2273 advanced electrochemical system at the scanning rate of 0.5 mV/s. Complex impedance measurements were carried out using Princeton 2273 electrochemical system over the single cell at the states of fully charged, fully discharged or discharging. A perturbation of 10 mV was applied and data collected under PC control and the frequency range applied is from 1 MHz to 100 mHz. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis The preparation of transparent titanyl nitrate, which ensures the molecular level homogeneous mixing of Li + and Ti 4+ in the precursor stage, was found to be a key point to obtain a pure phase Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 during the later calcination. Once tetrbutyl titanate [Ti(C 4 H 9 O) 4 ] was slowly dropped into de-ionized water, a hydrolysis reaction was occurred via the reaction as described in the following equation: (1) Ti[O(C 4 H 9 )] 4 + 3H 2 O \u2192 TiO(OH) 2 + 4(C 4 H 9 )OH Nitric acid was then introduced in time. The formed TiO(OH) 2 precipitate was then slowly dissolved by the HNO 3 via the reaction as shown in Eq. (2) , until a transparent titanyl nitrate solution (Eq. (2) ) was obtained. (2) \u2013Ti\u2013OH + HNO 3 \u2192 \u2013Ti\u2013NO 3 + H 2 O After the impregnation and drying, the solid cellulose\u2013GN precursor still took the morphologic shape of cotton fibers. During the heating treatment at 250 \u00b0C, the glycine reacted with nitrates to release a huge amount of heat, which triggered the combustion reaction of the cotton fiber in a following stage. Phenomenally, a sudden formation of enormous amount of gray smoke was happened which lasted less than 30 s, followed by the appearance of smothering combustion with occasional sparks sustained for several minutes. The resulted primary product, easily pulverized, still took the shape of initial cotton fiber while its color changed to gray. It suggests that a large amount of charry organic matters were still presented in the primary product. It was then further calcined between 500 and 900 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. After the calcinations at 500 \u00b0C, the color turned to bright gray, suggesting minor amount of carbon residual might still be presented in the product. When the calcination temperature was elevated to 700 or 800 \u00b0C, the powder took the color of carbon-free white. At 900 \u00b0C, the color changed to bright blue, a characteristic color of Li-deficient Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . Such deficiency was resulted from the high evaporating pressure of lithium oxide at 900 \u00b0C and the stoichiometric ratio of Li and Ti (4/5) applied in the synthesis. Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) the cellulose\u2013GN primary product and the samples after the further calcination at various temperatures for 5 h in air, and (b) the samples prepared by the solid-state route. From Fig. 2 (a), the primary product is a mixture of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -related phase, anatase-type TiO 2 and rutile-type TiO 2 . Very low peak intensity was observed, suggesting their poor crystallinity. After the calcination at 500 \u00b0C, the peak intensity of the anatase-type TiO 2 increased significantly. At 600 \u00b0C, the main Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 phase was formed alongside with the disappearance of the anatase-type TiO 2 phase. At 700 \u00b0C, a pure and well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide was obtained. Such a low calcination temperature needed to obtain pure phase Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 composite oxide suggests the effectiveness of cellulose\u2013GN process for low-temperature synthesis of pure phase Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with good crystallinity. From Fig. 2 (b) we can see obviously that using solid-state reaction after calcining at the temperature of 750 \u00b0C for 5 h, there is strong peak intensity of rutile-type TiO 2 . And it is not pure until the calcined temperature reached 850 \u00b0C for 17 h. The sudden combustion of cellulose\u2013GN precursor within seconds created high temperature about 500 \u00b0C as shown in Fig. 3 , which facilitated the formation of oxides, while the short combustion time and the prohibited particle contact due to the block effect of cellulose suppressed the crystalline growth during the high-temperature combustion. The cellulose fiber was then burnt out by a following smothering combustion. Since the short combustion time and appropriate combustion temperature for this step, the crystallite size of the oxides did not increase significantly, and the lithium did not lost. Although the auto-combustion did not lead to the formation of the aimed Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 phase directly, the small particle size means a short diffusion distance for the following solid-phase reaction; it then allows the synthesis of nano particles with high phase purity after the further calcination at a temperature much lower than that required based on solid-state reaction and many sol\u2013gel methods [28,45] . Kanamura et al. gained a pure phase of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 at 500 \u00b0C by emulsion\u2013gel method [50] . However, a further calcination at 800 \u00b0C was necessary to improve the electrochemical performance of the oxide since the low-temperature calcined one had very poor crystallinity, while the electrochemical behavior of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is typically highly dependent on its crystallinity. Recently, Kavan et al. reported an excellent high rate performance of a nano-crystalline thin-film Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 prepared using sol\u2013gel method [21] . As can be seen from their charge/discharge curves the capacity of discharge platform hold less than 50% of the whole discharge capacity. It suggests that a different mechanism from the Li + intercalation/de-intercalation in the bulk of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide may play an important role in the charge/discharge process of their nano-powder. The cycling performance, which is of great importance for practical application, is however, also lack for their sol\u2013gel derived anode. In general, a good electrochemical performance of the electrode material requires appropriate particle size and high crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 2 pure-phase Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was also obtained by cellulose\u2013GN process at a calcination temperature of 800 \u00b0C with the peak intensity higher than the 700 \u00b0C calcined one, suggesting the improved crystallinity of the oxide with temperature. In addition to the main phase of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , spinel Li 1.14 Ti 1.8 O 4 impurity phase was also observed after the calcination at 900 \u00b0C. It indicates the loss of lithium during this calcination, in accordance with the color change as observed. For the typical solid-phase reaction process, Li 2 CO 3 was applied as the raw material, a calcination temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C is applied. Since Li 2 CO 3 will melt at around 723 \u00b0C, the loss of Li by evaporation at temperatures higher than 800 \u00b0C is evident. Therefore, excess amount of lithium is typically applied to avoid the lithium deficiency. By the current technique, the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 can be formed at \u223c700 \u00b0C, which greatly increases the precise stoichiometry of the oxide by effectively avoiding the formation of liquid Li 2 CO 3 during the synthesis. Fig. 4 shows the SEM morphologies of pure cellulose, cellulose\u2013GN precursor, the oxides prepared by further calcination of the primary product (the product from the auto-combustion) at various temperatures between 500 and 900 \u00b0C for 5 h in air, and the pure sample prepared by solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h. The dry activated cotton fiber was in a twisted flat tubular shape, while the cotton fiber became round and robust after the impregnation by GN. It suggests that the glycine and metal nitrates successfully soaked into the pores and lumens of the cotton fiber in the cellulose\u2013GN precursor. After the auto combustion and the further calcination at 500\u2013900 \u00b0C, the fiber morphological shape was collapsed. With the increase of calcination temperature, the sintering was accelerated. The oxides calcined at 500\u2013700 \u00b0C show a porous morphological structure, while large grain with main sizes of 2\u20135 \u03bcm was observed for the sample calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h and solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h. The specific surface area and the crystallite size of the cellulose\u2013GN oxide calcined at various calcination temperatures and the pure sample prepared by solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h are listed in Table 1 . With the increase of calcination temperature, the particle size increased while the surface area decreased obviously. The particle size of the 700 and 800 \u00b0C calcined samples was further examined by TEM. As shown in Fig. 5 , the 700 \u00b0C calcined one is in quasi-sphere shape with the particle size of 10\u201320 nm, which increased to 50\u2013100 nm when the calcination temperature is 800 \u00b0C. 3.2 Electrochemical performance To clarify the effect of impurity on the electrochemical performance of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , some electrochemical tests were carried. Fig. 6 shows the first discharge/charge curves of the cells with various Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 electrodes at 1C rate over the potential range of 1.0\u20133.0 V, prepared by cellulose\u2013GN process at calcination temperatures between 500 and 900 \u00b0C. The first discharge capacities reached 180.4, 150.1, 187.2, 173.4, and 130.0 mAh/g, respectively, for the anode calcined from 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 \u00b0C. The 500 and 700 \u00b0C calcined ones show the initial discharge capacity higher than the theoretical capacity of spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (175 mAh/g), which may be related with the nano-crystalline of the particles, the small amount of carbon residual and high content of impurity phases (for example, large amount of anatase-type TiO 2 ) as shown in Fig. 2 . Kim also observed that nano-size Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 had an initial discharge capacity far exceeding its theoretical value [26] . The reversible capacity of the first cycle was found to be greatly influenced by the calcination temperature. As shown in Table 1 , the coulombic efficiency for the 1st cycle first increased steadily with the increase of calcination temperature, from a value of only \u223c60% for the 500 \u00b0C calcined sample to \u223c93% for the 700 \u00b0C calcined one, and then kept nearly constant with the further increase of the calcination temperature. However, the irreversible capacity was observed only at the first cycle, i.e., near 100% coulombic efficiency for the following cycles. It is well known that the irreversible capacity on carbon anode is frequently associated with SEI layer formation. Due to the high cut-off voltage (1.0 V) applied in this study for the discharge process; the SEI layer formation is unlikely over the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 electrodes [19,20] . The poor capacity reversibility of the 500 and 600 \u00b0C calcined ones may be related with their poor crystallinity and/or possible impurities. Since the Li-ion intercalation and de-intercalation are relied on the stable metal oxide structures of the anode, some intercalated lithium in the first discharge process possibly was not able to be de-intercalated due to the defects in the crystallites. The phase structure of the anode mixture was stabilized after the first cycling, which then led to no further decay of the capacity. At a calcination temperature higher than 700 \u00b0C, well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 phase was formed. Its irreversible capacity in the first cycle is likely associated with the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity on recharge. Different from the anodes prepared from the calcination between 600 and 900 \u00b0C, which show only one discharge/charge voltage platform at \u223c1.5 V/\u223c1.6 V, the 500 \u00b0C calcined one shows two discharge/charge platforms, one around 1.68 V (\u223c2.07 V) and the other at \u223c 1.50 V (\u223c1.65 V). Similarly, two discharge/charge platforms were also observed by Zhang et al. for some microwave synthesized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 [51] . They ascribed the additional discharge/charge platforms to the Li-ion insertion/extraction into/from the anatase TiO 2 impurity phase. As observed in Fig. 2 , the 500 \u00b0C calcined sample is characterized by the presence of noticeable amount of anatase-type TiO 2 . The pure anatase-type TiO 2 was then also investigated as the anode at the discharge/charge rate of 1C. As shown in Fig. 7 , broad discharge and charge platforms were observed at the voltages of 1.76 and 1.95 V, respectively. Such results strongly support that the second discharge/charge platforms for the 500 \u00b0C calcined sample were originated from the lithium intercalation and de-intercalation into/from the impurity phase of anatase-type TiO 2 in the anode. The anode performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is closely related with the particle size, particle morphologies, and crystallographic structure. According to the results in Table 1 , with the increase of calcination temperature, the surface area of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 decreased while the crystallite size increased. The larger grain size and smaller surface area means the longer diffusion distance of lithium ion and the smaller surface reaction active sites, which then resulted in the increase of polarization resistance at high charge/discharge rate. On the other hand, since the Li intercalation/de-intercalation into/from Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 bulk phase is closely related with its spinel crystallographic structure, a well-crystallized oxide with stable phase structure is required for a high cycling stability and large capacity of an anode. Based on above results, 700\u2013800 \u00b0C should be the optimal calcination temperature for high-rate performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode of this study. The relatively small voltage difference between the charge (1.59 V) and discharge (1.54 V) platforms at 1C rate ( Fig. 7 ) strongly suggests that the 700 \u00b0C calcined anode may be a promising material with highly reversible Li-ion intercalation/de-intercalation capability. Fig. 8 depicts the capability of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anodes prepared by cellulose\u2013GN process at calcination temperatures of 700 and 800 \u00b0C for 5 h and solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h at high discharge/charge rates of 1\u201340C. The data was obtained from the second discharge curves. As shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b), excellent high rate-performance was observed for both 700 and 800 \u00b0C calcined samples. At a discharge rate of 10C, reversible capacities of \u223c125 and 103 mAh/g were observed with near 100% coulombic efficiency, respectively, for the anode calcined at 700 and 800 \u00b0C. Even at a discharge rate of 20 C, a high capacity of 108 mAh/g was obtained for the 700 \u00b0C calcined sample, while it decreased to around 83 mAh/g for the 800 \u00b0C calcined one. Fig. 8 (c) displays the rate-capability of solid-state reaction sample. At a low current density, 1C, the sample gained from solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h shows a comparable capacity to the cellulose\u2013GN samples. This should be attributed to the sufficient time for both Li + and electronic transport at this low current rate. Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 grains inside the agglomerated particles can be electroactive due to long diffusion time. However, with increasing the charge\u2013discharge current rate, the difference between the lithium storage capacities of them becomes evident. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders prepared by cellulose\u2013GN process at calcination temperature of 700 \u00b0C for 5 h behave a very slow capacity fading upon increasing the current density. However, the capacity of the solid-state reaction sample drops very rapidly, leaving only 70 mAh/g at 10C and 37.5 mAh/g at 40C. This result is expected because of the smaller crystallite size of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders prepared by cellulose\u2013GN process at calcination temperature of 700 \u00b0C for 5 h compared to the one prepared by solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h. It is believed that a large portion of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 grains have become inactive during charge\u2013discharge due to the insufficient Li ion diffusion. This result confirms that the nano-Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxides obtained by cellulose\u2013GN way can affect the rate-capability of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anodes. The charge/discharge platform is an indication of the two-phase mechanism for the Li intercalation and de-intercalation. The capacity of the flat voltage is sometimes more important for practical application. The capacities for the platforms at various discharge rates for the 700 and 800 \u00b0C calcined samples are shown in Fig. 9 . As compared to the 700 \u00b0C calcined one, the 800 \u00b0C calcined anode has higher percentage of platform capacity of its overall discharge capacity at discharge rates of 1\u201320C, which suggests its higher crystallinity, in well accordance with the XRD results. However, the absolute values of capacity for both the platform and the overall discharge for the 800 \u00b0C calcined one are lower than that of the 700 \u00b0C calcined one at higher discharge rates (10\u201340C) ( Figs. 9 and 10 ). It suggests that the polarization increased with the calcination temperature. At high charge/discharge rates, large Li + ion extraction and insertion fluxes on the anode surface and low Li + ion conductivity in the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 bulk resulted in concentration polarization of Li + within the electrode materials, which caused the drop of the cell voltage and the termination of the discharge before the maximum capacity of the electrode material is reached. According to the results in Table 1 , the higher calcination temperature resulted in a larger crystallite size and smaller surface area. The larger grain size means longer diffusion distance for the lithium ion and electron inside the particle bulk so the larger lithium and electron bulk diffusion resistance, while a smaller surface area means less surface active sites for surface reactions so a larger interfacial polarization resistance. Consequently, the discharge capacity at high discharge rate decreased with the increase of calcination temperature. The cycling behaviors of the 700 \u00b0C calcined Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 were investigated. As shown in Fig. 10 is the discharge capacity vs. cycle number for the 700 \u00b0C calcined samples at various discharge rates between of 1 and 40C for \u223c50 times. Stable rate capacity was observed even at 40C, it suggests the promising application of the cellulose\u2013GN method for the synthesis of nano-crystalline powders for high-rate rechargeable lithium battery. Interestingly, the rate capacity decayed slightly in the first 20 cycles at 1C discharge rate. Since it was highly stable even at 40 C, the slight decay at 1C rate is unlikely due to the phase transition of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . It may be associated with the detachment of anode powder from the current collector of the copper film during the operation. At 1C discharge rate, one cycle takes about 120 min, while it takes only 12 min for one complete cycle at 10 C. The much longer time on operation at 1C then greatly increased the possibility of the detaching of active material from the current collector. The improvement of the cell preparation technique to increase the adhesion of the active materials to current collector is then important for long-term operational stability. More research works are definitely needed. Fig. 11 shows the cyclic voltammaograms of cells using the 700 \u00b0C calcined Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode at the scanning rate of 0.5 mV/s between 1.0 and 3.0 V, such a scanning rate equals to a charge/discharge rate of \u223c1C in a galvanostatic charge/discharge process. Only one oxidation/reduction peak is observed. The cathodic peak located around \u223c1.49 V corresponds to the voltage platform of the discharge process in which Li intercalated into the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The anodic peak located at \u223c1.66 V corresponds to the voltage platform of the charge process in which Li de-intercalated from the spinel Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 . Their difference is about 117 mV, somewhat larger than the difference between charge and discharge rates of 1C (50 mV) ( Fig. 5 ). Such difference may be caused from electrochemical polarization. Since there is no other redox peaks in the cyclic voltammaograms, the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is pure in nature, in accordance with the XRD results. Except the first cathodic peak which shows larger peak area than the following cycles, the cyclic voltagemmetric curves repeated with each other very well for the cycle 2 to cycle 6. It further supports the high reversibility and stability of the Li-ion intercalation and de-intercalation into/from the 700 \u00b0C calcined Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode. To further understand the electrode process kinetic behavior, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement was conducted. Fig. 12 (a) shows the Nyquist plots of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 |electrolyte|Li cell in the completely discharge (1.0 V), the complete charge (3.0 V) and the first discharge platform (1.54 V) states. The plots are comprised of a depressed semicircle in high-to-medium frequency range and a line inclined at constant angle to the real axis in the frequency range below 5 Hz. The high-frequency intercept at the x axis is typically attributed to the ohmic resistance of the cell (mainly contributed from the electrolyte), while the depressed semicircle in the high-to-medium frequency range is normally related to the complex reaction process over the electrolyte/anode interface, which may also include the particle to particle contact resistance, charge-transfer resistance and corresponding capacitances. The inclined line in the lower frequency range, attributed to the Warburg impedance, is associated with lithium-ion diffusion through the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 electrode [52,53] . The data of Fig. 12 (a) were found to be well fitted by the equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 12 (b). In the equivalent circuit, R s indicates the ohmic resistance of electrolyte and electrode; R ct is attributed to the charge transfer resistance at the active material interface; R f is the polarization resistance related with surface charge/discharge process and contacting resistance between anode particles; C dl represents the double-layer capacitance of the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface and C f indicates the surface capacitance. R s , R ct , R f , C f and C dl all correspond to the high-frequency semicircle. Z w is the Warburg impedance caused by a semi-infinite diffusion of Li + ion in electrode and corresponds to the inclined line in the lower frequency range. As can be seen from Fig. 12 that R s , R ct and R f decreased obviously and steadily transition from the fully charge state to the fully discharge state. The total electrode resistances at 1.00, 1.54 and 3.00 V are 124.1, 151.5 and 189.3 \u03a9, respectively. The reduction ratio reached almost 70%. It suggests that the complex process at the electrolyte/anode interface is greatly improved after the discharging. For the lithium intercalation/de-intercalation through Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode, it can be expressed as following equation. (3) (charge, Ti 3+ \u2192 Ti 4+ )Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 + 3Li + + 3e \u2212 \u2194 Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 (discharge, Ti 3+ \u2192 Ti 4+ ) The intercalation/de-intercalation process is associated with the redox of Ti 4+ /Ti 3+ . The discharge process resulted in the reduction of Ti 4+ to Ti 3+ and the increase of the electronic conductivity of the anode [54] . The simultaneous reduction in the size of the high-frequency depleted semi-circle suggests the electrolyte/electrode complex reaction is significantly improved with the increase of the electronic conductivity of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . Such improvement, based on the results in Fig. 12 , may be associated with the improvement of the charge transfer process over the electrode surface. Anyway, a surface modification with conductive materials could then be beneficial for further improving the anode performance of the as-synthesized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The surface modification with higher conductive oxide such as silver, copper, conduction carbon and others indeed resulted in a significant improvement of rate performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 [34\u201338] . Modification of as-synthesized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with conductive materials to further improve its rate performance will be conducted soon. The chemical diffusion coefficient of Li + inside Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 can be estimated from the impedance results. The following expression for Z w was derived by solving Fick's law [53,55] : (4) Z w = A \u03c9 \u2212 1 / 2 \u2212 j A \u03c9 \u2212 1 / 2 (5) A = V M ( d E /d x ) 2 z F D \u02dc 1 / 2 a where, \u03c9 is the frequency, j = \u2212 1 , and the pre-exponential factor A is a constant which contains a concentration independent chemical diffusion coefficient, as shown in Eq. (5) . V M is the molar volume of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (45.73 cm 3 /mol), d E /d x is the slope of the electrode potential curve vs. x in Fig. 13 , z is the charge transfer number ( z = 1 in the lithium intercalation reaction), a is the electroactive surface area of the electrode, which is 0.785 cm 2 in our testing electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and D \u02dc is the diffusion coefficient. Fig. 14 displays the dependence of impedances on frequencies at the cell potentials of 1.00, 1.54 and 3.00 V. Both the real and imaginary parts of impedance were found to be parallel to each other, and proportional to \u03c9 \u22121/2 , in accordance with the result reported by Rho and Kanamura [55] . Based on the slope of the plot, the value of A was obtained. Since A is inversely proportional to the chemical diffusion coefficient, D \u02dc , as demonstrated in Eq. (5) , the larger A , the slower diffusion rate of Li + ions in the solid matrix of the electrode should be. Table 2 lists the values of d E /d x , A and D \u02dc at various electrode potentials. The chemical diffusion coefficient, D \u02dc , at around 1.54 V was failed to be obtained as d E /d x almost equal to 0 due to the coexistence of two phases, however, the corresponding A value is the smallest, suggesting the diffusion of Li + ions is very fast at such potential vs. Li/Li + . This conclusion agrees well with the observation of Rho and Kanamura [55] . The chemical diffusion coefficient ranging from 1.98 \u00d7 10 \u22128 to 5.43 \u00d7 10 \u22129 cm 2 /s was observed at 30 \u00b0C. A reported value of Li chemical diffusion coefficient inside Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is at the range of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22128 to 2 \u00d7 10 \u221212 cm 2 /s [55,56] . Our results are among the best reported results. The variation of Li + diffusion coefficient reported by different researchers suggests that the synthesis technique has significant effect on the Li + transportation inside the electrode. On the other hand, the current cellulose-based synthesis technique turns out to be an excellent one for achieving Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide with a high Li + bulk diffusion coefficient. 4 Conclusions Nano-sized spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders have been successfully synthesized by a novel glycine-nitrate combustion process constricted in the pores of cellulose fibers. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders, which calcined at 700 and 800 \u00b0C, have pure phase and good crystallinity with average particle size of \u223c28 and 60 nm, respectively, smaller than those obtained by solid-state reaction and many sol\u2013gel methods, due to the bock effect of cellulose during the combustion synthesis and the short combustion time. High electrochemical performance was reached for the 700 \u00b0C calcined one, which delivered an attractive capacity of \u223c125 mAh/g at 10C discharge rate with fairly stable cycling performance even at 40C, owing to the good crystallinity and phase purity. The cyclic voltammogram measurement testified that the electrochemical reaction of the prepared Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 |electrolyte|Li cell has high reversibility and cycling performance. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results support that the anode performance is improved when the electronic conductivity was increased. The Li + ion is more mobile in the active material near 1.54 V vs. Li/Li + corresponding to the two-phase coexistence region. Accordingly, the surface modification of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with improved surface reaction kinetics could further increase the performance of the resulted Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode.

Therefore, the synthesis procedure was greatly simplified.

The critical amount of NH4NO3 for the autocombustion to occur was identified at the NO3 - to citric acid to EDTA mole ratio of around 10:2:1. After the experimental optimization, well-crystallized nanostructured La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- \u03b4 (LSCF) powder with a specific surface area as high as 21 m2/g was obtained; it is comparable with that obtained from a normal complexing process. By adjusting the combustion parameters, the properties of the powders then derived can be tailored for different applications, such as nanograined dense membrane for oxygen separation membrane, and porous cathode for fuel cells and sensors. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "A novel perovskite-type La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 3 (LSSM) oxide was synthesized and evaluated as the electrode material of a symmetric solid-oxide fuel cell. Characterization was done by electrical conductivity, crystal structure stability, redox stability, catalytic activity for methane oxidation and oxygen electro-reduction. LSSM shows greater electrical conductivity than the typical La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 3 (LSCM) perovskite oxide under both anode and cathode operating conditions. It also shows excellent chemical and structural stability due to the backbone effect of Sc 3+ for the perovskite lattice structure. A symmetric electrolyte-supported cell with 0.3 mm thick scandium-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and LSSM as cathode and anode shows peak power densities of 310 and 130 mW cm 2 at 900 \u00b0C, respectively, when operating on wet H 2 and wet CH 4 . Stable performance is demonstrated. Keywords Perovskite Symmetrical cell Redox stability Oxygen reduction Solid-oxide fuel cell 1 Introduction Fuel cells, which electrochemically convert chemical energy to electrical power with much greater efficiency and lower emission of greenhouse gases than well-established technologies based on traditional fossil fuel combustion, have attracted growing attention for the development of renewable energy supplies [1\u20133] . Among the many types of fuel cells, proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) are the two most explored types. A SOFC is an all-solid device which typically operates at 500\u20131000 \u00b0C. The high operating temperature improves fuel conversion efficiency and electrode activity [4,5] . Consequently, much cheaper metals or metal oxides can be applied as electrode materials to replace precious Pt, which is the main component of PEMFCs\u2019 electrode catalyst [6,7] . The high operating temperature also accepts a wide range of fuels; besides hydrogen, other more accessible chemicals such as methane, gasoline and coal are all potential fuels for SOFCs [8\u201314] . The high fuel flexibility is a practical advantage since the infrastructure of hydrogen production, storage and transportation is still far from mature. Despite the above benefits, progress towards the commercialization of SOFCs is still much less than that of PEMFCs. The main obstacles include inefficient materials, complicated fabrication processes and poor long-term operating stability. A SOFC is composed of a dense oxide electrolyte sandwiched between two porous electrodes, which typically have been sintered differently and have different thermal expansion coefficients (TEC). To perform as an ideal electrolyte, the oxide should have high ionic conductivity but negligible electronic conductivity, favorable thermal and chemical stability under both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, and high mechanical strength. Yttria-or Scandia-stabilized zirconia (YSZ or ScSZ) are the most well developed ionic conductors and meet most of the requirements of SOFC electrolytes [4,5] . Exploiting proper electrode materials is, however, still an area of great challenge. Because they are exposed to atmospheres with significantly different oxygen potentials, materials with different compositions are usually applied to the anode and cathode. Recently, a new SOFC configuration of using the same material for both electrodes, named symmetric SOFC, has been proposed and investigated [15\u201320] . The application of this new concept leads to a number of advantages. Possible coke formation over the anode can be easily eliminated by facilely switching the gas flow without causing damage to the cell. In the same way, sulphur poisoning of the anode can also be effectively alleviated. Based on this concept, the life-span of fuel cell is also doubled. Furthermore, the strains induced during the fabrication of SOFC due to the mismatch of TECs between different cell components are greatly reduced since only one type of electrode\u2013electrolyte interface exists. The identical composition of anode and cathode also allows them to be fired in a single step during cell fabrication; consequently, fabrication cost could be effectively reduced. As the electrode of a symmetric SOFC, it should meet the requirements of a cathode and an anode simultaneously, i.e., good chemical and thermal stability and high electronic conductivity under both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, and high electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction and for hydrogen or hydrocarbon oxidation. The state-of-the-art anode is composed of Ni/YSZ (Ni/ScSZ) cermet [21,22] , which shows excellent electro-catalytic properties for hydrogen oxidation and favorable electronic conductivity (>1000 S cm \u22121 ). The classic SOFC cathode is composed of a perovskite-type oxide, such as a pure electronic conductor of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) [23] , or mixed ionic and electronic conductors of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3-\u03b4 (LSCF) [24,25] and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3-\u03b4 (BSCF) [26,27] , which show excellent cathodic performances at high and intermediate temperatures, respectively. Since nickel easily loses its activity and electronic conductivity under cathodic atmospheres due to oxidization of nickel, LSCF- and BSCF-based perovskite oxides are chemically unstable under the reducing atmosphere of the anode; thus, all of these materials are not applicable as the electrode of a symmetric SOFC. Up to now, only very limited numbers of materials have successfully been demonstrated as electrodes of symmetric SOFCs. La 0.75 Sr 0.25 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 3 (LSCM) represents one of the most investigated materials [15\u201318] . As an anode material, LSCM showed wonderful chemical stability but relatively low electronic conductivity in the fuel atmospheres. More importantly, LSCM had relatively poor oxygen reduction activity as a cathode material. On the other side, as mentioned previously, a classic cathode material of LSM is chemically unstable under the reducing atmosphere of the anode. Therefore, it is urgently to develop an alternative electrode for symmetric solid-oxide fuel cell application. Previously, we demonstrated that La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc y Mn 1-y O 3 possesses not only better cathode performance in oxidizing atmosphere, but also higher chemical and structural stability than LSM under reducing atmospheres [28] . Both characteristics are the most fundamental requirements of a potential electrode for symmetric SOFCs. In this study, for the first time, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 3 (LSSM) perovskite oxide was systematically evaluated as the electrodes of a symmetric SOFC with zirconia-based electrolyte operating on hydrogen or methane fuel. Investigations were made into the phase stability, electrical conductivity under both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, electro-catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, catalytic activity for methane oxidation, and single cell performance. 2 Experimental procedures LSSM oxide powder was synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [29,30] . La(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7xH 2 O, Sr(NO 3 ) 3 , Sc 2 O 3 and Mn(Ac) 2 \u00b74H 2 O, (all A.R. grade) were used as the metal\u2013ion sources. La(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7xH 2 O was first prepared in an aqueous solution around 1 M with its precise concentration determined by the standard EDTA titration technique. Sc 2 O 3 was prepared in 1 M aqueous Sc(NO 3 ) 3 solution by dissolving it in 6 M nitric acid under heating and then diluted with a proper amount of de-ionized water. Required amounts of La(NO 3 ) 3 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Sc(NO 3 ) 3 , and Mn(Ac) 2 \u00b74H 2 O were then prepared in a mixed aqueous solution. EDTA-NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O solution and citric acid solid were added in sequence under stirring and heating at a mole ratio of total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid of 1:1:2. The water was evaporated from the solution by heating at 90 \u00b0C until a transparent gel was obtained, which was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and further calcinated at 950 \u00b0C in air for 5 h to get the final products with the desired lattice structure. (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) was used as the electrolyte material, also prepared by the EDTA-citrate complexing process. To fabricate a single cell, the ScSZ powders were pressed into disk-shape pellets and then fired in air at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h to achieve densification of the electrolytes. The sintered cells had a diameter of \u223c13 mm and a thickness of \u223c0.3 mm. LSSM powders were dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension using a high-energy ball miller (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6) at a rotational speed of 400 rpm for 1 h. The suspension was then symmetrically painted on both central surfaces of the dense ScSZ pellets. The whole cell was then calcinated at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to fabricate complete symmetric SOFCs. The phase structure of synthesized powders was characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). For phase stability tests, about 0.2 g samples were placed in a U-type quartz tube reactor and treated at high temperature (typically 850 \u00b0C) under various atmospheres for 24 h. The oxides were cooled to room temperature under the same atmosphere and subjected to phase structure examination. For a series of temperature-programmed tests including hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR), oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) and oxygen temperature-programmed oxidization (O 2 -TPO), approximately 0.03\u20130.15 g oxide powder was placed in a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm. 5 vol.% H 2 /Ar (for H 2 -TPR), pure argon (for O 2 -TPD) or 1 vol.% O 2 /Ar (for O 2 -TPO) at the flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP: standard temperature and pressure] was introduced to the reactor. After flowing with the gas at room temperature for \u223c30 min, the reactor was heated to 1000 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The effluent gas from the reactor was connected with a Hiden QIC-20 Mass spectroscope (MS) for in-situ monitoring of concentration variations of selected species. The electrical conductivities of the samples under various atmospheres were measured by a four-probe DC technique. The oxide powders were pressed and sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h to get dense bars with approximate dimensions of 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 12 mm 3 . Before measurement in each atmosphere, bar samples were pre-treated at 850 \u00b0C for 20 h. Data was collected via a Keithley 2420 digital source meter interfaced with the computer data acquisition system Labview. Electrochemical characterization of LSSM as a cathode material in ScSZ electrolyte was conducted based on a three-electrode configuration. Isopropyl alcohol-based LSSM slurry was applied to one side of electrolyte substrate by spray deposition and then calcinated at 1150 \u00b0C in air for 2 h to form the working electrode. Ethanol-based silver slurry was then applied to another side of the electrolyte as symmetrically as possible with the working electrode to act as the counter electrode. Silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai, China) painted as a ring surrounding the counter electrode was used as the reference electrode; the gap between the counter and reference electrodes was \u223c 4 mm, and the area of the working, counter and reference electrodes was 0.26, 0.26 and 0.3 cm 2 , respectively. For comparison, the cathode performance of a typical symmetric SOFC electrode of LSCM was also investigated in a similar way and a sintering temperature of 1250 \u00b0C was used to make the electrode adhere to electrolyte. The electrode polarization resistance was investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS) measurement using a Solartron 1260 Frequency Response Analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency of EIS measurement ranged from 0.1 to 1000 kHz and signal amplitude was 10 mV. Samples were tested under open circuit voltage (OCV) condition or a constant cathodic current polarization of 400 mA cm \u22122 . For redox stability measurement, samples were alternatively tested in air and wet CH 4 for five cycles at 850 \u00b0C. Before acquiring data in each testing atmosphere, the sample was first polarized at a constant cathodic or anodic current of 400 mA cm \u22122 for 20 min. Data were collected using Z-Plot 2.9 c software. The overall impedance data were fitted by a complex non-linear least square (CNLS) fitting program by Z-View 2.9 c software. The catalytic performance of the perovskite oxides for methane partial oxidation, steam or CO 2 reforming were tested in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor. About 0.2 g (for partial oxidation reaction) or 0.1 g (for reforming reaction) of freshly prepared catalyst (particle size of 0.25\u20130.4 mm prepared via pressing and filtering by two 40 and 60 meshes), diluted by quartz sand to form a bed length of \u223c5 mm, was introduced into a quartz tube with an inner diameter of \u223c6 mm between two quartz wool plugs. A thermocouple, protected by a quartz tube, was inserted into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. The gas lines connected with the reactor were heated at 250 \u00b0C to prevent water condensation. The gas ratio of the reactants was controlled at CH 4 /O 2 /He = 25/5/140, CH 4 /H 2 O/He = 5/5/80 and CH 4 /CO 2 /He = 5/5/80 ml min \u22121 [STP] by AFC 80MD digital mass flow controllers (Qualiflow) for partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming reaction, respectively. A stabilization time of 15 min was allowed for each testing point. The effluent gases from the reactor were introduced to an on-line gas chromatograph (CP-3800, VARIAN) equipped with Hayesep Q, PoraPlot Q and molecular sieve 5 \u00c5 capillary columns and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for quantitative analysis. An electrolyte-supported single cell configuration was adopted for the fuel cell test. The single cell was composed of ScSZ electrolyte (0.3 mm), fabricated from homemade ScSZ, and LSSM electrodes (30 \u03bcm) in a symmetric configuration with an effective geometric area of 0.26 cm 2 on each side. To avoid additional catalytic effect for fuel oxidation, Au and Ag pastes were adopted as the current collectors at anode and cathode sides, respectively. Methane and hydrogen were applied as the fuels, at the rate of 50 ml min \u22121 [STP] humidified by water at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure and stability To successfully perform as electrodes of a symmetric SOFC, a prerequisite is that the material should possess sufficiently high structural and chemical stability under the operating conditions, which vary from very oxidizing atmosphere at the cathode (typically air) to highly reducing atmosphere at the anode (typically hydrogen). The room-temperature XRD patterns of LSSM after treatment at 850 \u00b0C for 24 h under various oxidizing or reducing atmospheres near the real fuel cell conditions are shown in Fig. 1 a and b. For comparison, the corresponding phase structures of a typical SOFC cathode of LSM and a typical symmetric SOFC electrode of LSCM are also presented. In air, LSSM took an orthorhombic symmetry with space group R 3 c \u00af , with a = 7.556(5), b = 5.417(3) and c = 5.387(1) \u00c5, similar to that of LSM and LSCM. The perovskite lattice structure of LSM collapsed under a more reducing atmosphere of wet 5% H 2 /Ar, while it was successfully preserved for LSSM and LSCM oxides. It suggests the partial substitution of Mn 4+/3+ in LSM by Cr 3+ /Cr 4+ or Sc 3+ resulted in an obvious improvement in the stability of the oxides against reducing atmospheres. The perovskite structure was also sustained under humidified CH 4 for LSSM, while it was totally destroyed under a more reducing atmosphere of dry methane. Furthermore, serious carbon formation was also observed over the LSSM surface after the treatment in dry methane at 850 \u00b0C for 24 h. As compared to LSSM, much less carbon was observed under a dry methane atmosphere over both LSM and LSCM. In order to quantitatively analyze the coke formation, an O 2 -TPO was introduced. Before the O 2 -TPO test, all oxides were treated in a dry methane atmosphere for 20 h. As shown in Fig. 2 , the peak intensity of the carbon dioxide, produced from the oxidation of carbon over the LSSM oxide surface, was much larger than that produced from LSM and LSCM. As shown in Fig. 1 b, the basic perovskite structure of LSCM was sustained even after treatment with dry methane, while it was destroyed for both LSSM and LSM, implying that LSCM had intrinsically greater stability than LSM and LSSM. The carbon over the perovskite oxide was formed through a methane cracking reaction. The reaction was closely related to surface oxygen vacancy concentration of the perovskite oxide [31,32] . The greater amount of carbon dioxide produced from the LSSM sample implies that LSSM may have a higher surface oxygen vacancy concentration than other materials. We will discuss this issue in more detail later. A further observation of the XRD patterns reveals a steady shift of the diffraction peak at mirror index (110) to a lower 2 \u03b8 value with decreasing oxygen partial pressure, indicating unit cell expansion. The lattice constant of quasi-cubic perovskite ( a \u2032) for as prepared LSSM ( P O 2 = 0.21 {atm}) was 5.645(7) \u00c5, which increased to 5.702(2), 5.694(1) and 5.689(6) \u00c5 after treatment under wet 5% H 2 ( P O 2 \u22481.2 \u00d7 10 \u221218 atm), dry H 2 ( P O 2 \u22481.0 \u00d7 10 \u221221 atm) and wet CH 4 ( P O 2 \u224810 \u221223 atm) atmospheres, respectively. It is well known that the phase structure and lattice constant are closely related with the ionic size of A- and B-site cations. Manganese can take multiple oxidation states varying from +2 to +4 in a perovskite-type oxide, depending on the oxygen partial pressure and temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. Decreasing oxygen partial pressure may lead to thermal reduction of manganese to a lower oxidation state, accompanied with an increase in ionic radius and subsequent lattice expansion. Resistance against thermal and chemical reduction for the three samples was further studied by H 2 -TPR with the results shown in Fig. 3 . The reduction peak which appeared between 500 and 600 \u00b0C was assigned to the reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ (also Cr 4+ to Cr 3+ for LSCM). This peak moved to a higher temperature zone when Sc 3+ or Cr 3+ /Cr 4+ was introduced into the perovskite lattice, suggesting greater chemical stability of the oxides resulted from Sc 3+ /Cr 4+ doping. A small shoulder peak also appeared around 470 \u00b0C for LSCM, and is attributed to the reduction of Cr 6+ to Cr 4+ . An additional broad reduction peak in the temperature range of 700\u2013900 \u00b0C is ascribed to the reduction of Mn 3+ to Mn 2+ . This peak was observed for LSM and did not appear for LSSM and LSCM oxides. This implies that the introduction of Sc 3+ or Cr 3+ /Cr 4+ into the perovskite lattice substantially increased the chemical stability of Mn 3+ under a reducing atmosphere. The reduction of Mn 3+ to Mn 2+ has two detrimental effects on the phase stability of the oxide. First, the perovskite lattice would be too empty due to over-depletion of the oxygen from the lattice structure ( \u03b4 = 0.9 at Mn = +2). Second, the reduction of Mn 3+ ( r HS = 0.645 \u00c5) to Mn 2+ ( r HS = 0.83 \u00c5) results in an increase of nominal ionic radius of the B-site cations, which leads to a mismatch in radius of the A-site and B-site cations. This consequently leads to a phase transition as shown in Fig. 1 b. 3.2 Electrical conductivity The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivities of LSM, LSCM and LSSM under atmospheres with different oxygen partial pressures are shown in Fig. 4 . LSM demonstrated the highest electrical conductivity among the three samples, followed by LSSM and LSCM. Maximum conductivities reached 166, 45 and 24 S cm \u22121 at 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Unlike the mixed conductors BSCF and LSCF oxides, the electrical conductivities of all three materials did not show an obvious change with respect to P O 2 at relatively high oxygen partial pressure. For example, LSSM had an almost constant conductivity of \u223c45 S cm \u22121 at 850 \u00b0C when the atmosphere changed from air ( P O 2 = 0.21 atm) to 1% O 2 /Ar ( M O 2 = 0.01 atm) and to N 2 ( P O 2 = 10 \u22125 atm). Such stable conductivity is favorable for cathode applications. Generally, manganese-based perovskite oxides, like LSM, exhibit apparent oxygen excess nonstoichiometry ( \u03b4 < 0) and show stable conductivities until ( P O 2 is below 10 \u22125 atm with a p-type conducting mechanism [33,34] . Electronic conduction in perovskite oxides is normally created by electron hopping between B-site lattice cations through strongly overlapping B\u2013O\u2013B bonds with a mechanism like the Zerner double exchange process. For LSSM, due to the fixed oxidation state of scandium (+3), polaron hopping occurred mainly through the Mn 3+ \u2013O 2\u2212 \u2013Mn 4+ bond. Based on the O 2 -TPD results of LSSM as shown in Fig. 3 inset, there was no obvious oxygen desorption peak at \u2a7d900 \u00b0C, which was associated with the reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ . This implies that the variation in Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ concentrations is very small with the change of atmosphere from air ( P O 2 = 0.21 atm) to an inert gas (Ar, P O 2 \u224810 \u22125 atm). It then explains the small variation of the electrical conductivity when the atmosphere was changed from air to nitrogen. To perform as an anode, a material will experience a much stronger reducing atmosphere than at the cathode. The oxygen partial pressure of an anode could reach as low as 10 \u221219 atm in a hydrogen flow. With further reduction of the oxygen partial pressure from 10 \u22125 atm, Mn 4+ started to be reduced to a lower oxidation state. As demonstrated by the H 2 -TPR shown in Fig. 3 , the Mn 4+ in LSSM was steadily reduced to Mn 3+ by diluted hydrogen (5 vol.%) with the programmed temperature increase. The reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ resulted in both a decrease of electron cloud density of the outer molecular orbit and the formation of oxygen vacancies; both of these processes block electron hopping. This explains the reduced electrical conductivity with decreasing oxygen partial pressure from an inert gas to the more reducing atmosphere of hydrogen. As an ideal anode, a material should possess sufficiently high electronic conductivity (typically >100 S cm \u22121 ) to ensure efficient current collection. However, it allows down to 1 S cm \u22121 by optimizing the pore structure [21] . Relatively low electronic conductivities of perovskite oxides are a significant disadvantage as compared to Ni-based materials. The conductivity of the typical perovskite-type anode of LSCM was reported to be around 1.5 S cm \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C in a 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere [35,36] , which is near the minimum value for an anode material. As shown in Fig. 4 , the primarily electronic conductivities of LSSM in anodic atmosphere conditions of wet and dry 5% H 2 /Ar reached 6.1 and 5.2 S cm \u22121 at 850 \u00b0C, respectively. They are several times higher than that of LSCM at similar conditions (\u223c1.02 S cm \u22121 under dry hydrogen). It suggests that LSSM may have better anode performance than LSCM with respect to current collecting efficiency and electron transfer. Furthermore, the decrease in electric conductivity with reducing oxygen partial pressure suggests that p-type conductivity is the dominating conducting mechanism for both LSSM and LSCM oxides. Considering the magnitude of the mobility is relatively low [37] , the higher electrical conductivity suggests that a higher hole carrier ( h ) concentration in LSSM. These h may play a crucial role in catalysis of oxides for methane oxidation and oxygen reduction. The electrical conductivity of LSM under hydrogen was not obtained because the LSM material was destroyed during the measurement in the deeply reducing atmosphere. 3.3 Activity of LSSM for oxygen reduction As an ideal cathode material, a material must have sufficient electrical conductivity and high activity for oxygen electro-reduction. Oxygen reduction over an electrode involves a series of steps, including gas phase diffusion, surface adsorption, surface diffusion, dissociation, charge transfer (both electron and oxygen ion), and the incorporation of oxygen ion into the electrolyte layer at the triple-phase boundary (TPB) region. Any of above steps may introduce a significant polarization resistance towards oxygen reduction. The oxygen dissociation and surface diffusion of oxygen ions ( O ad - and O ad 2 - ) are closely related to the surface oxygen vacancy concentration. Unlike many cobalt-based mixed conductors which contain considerable amounts of oxygen vacancies, LSM-based perovskite exhibits apparent oxygen excess nonstoichiometry ( \u03b4 < 0) and pure electronic conductivity in air and weakly reducing atmospheres [38] . When no direct current is applied, the polarization resistance of fresh LSSM and LSCM electrodes reached values of 6.5 and 3.2 \u03a9 cm 2 at 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Such large polarization resistances suggest that it is unlikely that there is any bulk oxygen ionic conductivity inside these two materials, and the oxygen reduction reaction occurred only at the TPB region. However, the polarization resistance decreased sharply, as shown in Fig. 5 a, to only 0.18 \u03a9 cm 2 when LSSM was subjected to \u2212400 mA cm \u22122 direct current for 30 min. Such a significant improvement in electrode performance was attributed to the generation of oxygen vacancies at the electrode/electrolyte interface region by the partial reduction of Mn 4+ in LSSM to Mn 3+ or even to Mn 2+ , induced by the current polarization. The creation of oxygen vacancy can be written as [39,40] : (1) O O,LSSM \u00d7 + 2 Mn Mn + V O,ScSZ + 2 e \u2032 \u2194 2 Mn Mn \u00d7 + V O,LSSM + O O,ScSZ \u00d7 where O O,LSSM \u00d7 and O O,ScSZ \u00d7 are oxygen ions in LSSM and ScSZ lattice sites, V O,LSSM and V O,ScSZ are oxygen vacancies at the interface of LSSM and ScSZ. From Fig. 5 a and b, it can be found that the process at low frequencies improved much more prominently after the current passage. It suggests that these regenerated oxygen vacancies spread more on the surface of LSSM than the interface of electrode and electrolyte. On the other hand, much less effect on the cathodic polarization was observed for the LSCM electrode ( Fig. 5 b). The polarization resistance was \u223c1.43 \u03a9 cm 2 for LSCM at 850 \u00b0C after cathodic polarization, as compared to \u223c3.2 \u03a9 cm 2 before polarization. Fig. 6 shows the cathodic current responses to the time at a constant cathodic potential of \u22120.5 V ( P O 2 = 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221210 atm) at 850 \u00b0C for both LSSM and LSCM. The polarization resistance of LSCM decreased only slightly even after high cathodic current passage, whereas LSSM demonstrated a substantial drop in polarization resistance after prolonged polarization. The reduced effectiveness in activating the LSCM electrode by direct current passage may be associated with the high concentration (50%) of Cr 3+ /Cr 4+ in the LSCM lattice, which prevented the creation of oxygen vacancies by restraining the reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ . To further investigate the essential and rate-determining steps of oxygen reduction over both LSSM and LSCM electrodes, their impedance spectra in various oxygen partial pressures were fitted to the equivalent circuit LR s (RQ) 1 (RQ) 2 (as shown in Fig. 5 a inset for LSSM) or LR s (RQ) H (RQ) 1 (RQ) 2 (as shown in Fig. 5 b inset for LSCM). The inductance L is primarily ascribed to the leads and Ag or Au current collectors. The R s is ascribed to electrolyte resistance. R H , a small arc in the extra-high frequency range, corresponds to the incorporation of oxygen ions into electrolyte over the TPB, which was created from the impurity phase within LSCM formed during high-temperature sintering [41] . Generally, the depressed arc at high frequencies is related to the charge transfer process, while the arc at low frequency ranges is associated with oxygen dissociation and surface diffusion processes. No gas phase diffusion arc appeared in the EIS of this study, suggesting sound electrode pore microstructures. As mentioned previously, oxygen reduction is complicated and involves multiple steps. To gain more insight into these overlapped arcs, an appropriate model proposed by van Heuveln and Bouwmeester was adopted [42] : (Step1) O 2 \u2192 2 O ad (Step2) O ad + e \u2192 O ad - (Step3) O ad - \u2192 O TPB - (Step4) O TPB - + e \u2192 O TPB 2 - (Step 5) O TPB 2 - + V O \u2192 O O \u00d7 To relate each arc in EIS with above steps, the EIS of LSSM and LSCM at various oxygen partial pressure atmospheres were measured with the results shown in Fig. 7 a and b. The EIS data was fitted by 1/ R depending on P O 2 1 / n with the derived parameters presented in Table 1 . Generally, different values of n correspond to different reaction steps; for example, n = 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 0 and 1 reflects ( Step 3, Step 2, Step 1, Step 5 ), and oxygen molecule diffusion in the cathode pores, respectively. A detailed calculation can be found in Refs. [42\u201344] . As shown in Fig. 7 a and b, LSSM and LSCM electrodes demonstrated different oxygen partial pressure dependencies. Regarding the higher frequency arc RE 1 for LSSM, the slope of the fitting line was approximate 1/4. This process may then be associated with the diffusion of O ad - or O ad 2 - along the LSSM electrode surface to the TPB region. This was supported by the fact that the values of capacitance and f max were also within the typical range for this process [45,46] . With respect to the lower frequency arc, a transition in the n value was observed with a value of \u223c0.30 and 0.02 at P O 2 < 0.2 atm and P O 2 > 0.2 atm, respectively. The near zero n value at P O 2 > 0.02 atm suggests that this process was determined by some intrinsic properties of the electrode. Different from LSSM, the n of RE 1 and RE 2 was about 1/2 and 3/8 of LSCM, respectively. These two processes were then assigned to oxygen dissociation and electron transfer to the oxygen atom. The larger low-frequency arc implies oxygen reduction over the LSCM electrode was rate-limited mainly by an electron transfer process, agreeing well with the low electronic conductivity at low oxygen partial pressure. The significant difference in rate-limiting steps for LSSM and LSCM electrodes may be related to their different behaviors under current polarization. As demonstrated previously, when LSSM was subjected to a current polarization, oxygen vacancies were created due to the reduction of Mn 4+ to Mn 3+ . Therefore, the active sites of oxygen reduction over the LSSM electrode surface after current polarization were extended to the bulk electrode. As for LSCM, the oxygen reduction reactions happened still mainly over the TPB range even after current polarization. 3.4 Catalytic activities of LSSM for methane oxidation By applying methane as the fuel of a SOFC, the anode reaction could proceed through the direct electro-oxidation of methane to CO 2 and H 2 O, or indirect oxidation by first reforming it to CO and H 2 , which are then electro-oxidized into CO 2 and H 2 O to produce electricity. The methane partial oxidation or reforming reaction is also possible under OCV conditions when oxygen was added to avoid the carbon coking or methane was humidified. The anode performance of LSSM is then closely related with its activity for methane partial oxidation or steam/CO 2 reforming. Fig. 8 a shows methane conversion and product selectivity at the methane to oxygen ratio of 5:1 at various temperatures. No reaction occurred when the operating temperature was lower than 550 \u00b0C and the oxygen was totally converted only at T > 700 \u00b0C. This suggests that LSSM cannot be applied to operate on a methane\u2013oxygen mixture at T < 700 \u00b0C due to the high oxygen potential in the anode stream. With an increase of operating temperature, the methane conversion increased steadily and reached 16% at 900 \u00b0C. At temperatures lower than 700 \u00b0C, CO 2 and H 2 O were the sole reaction products, suggesting the total oxidation mechanism (reaction (2)). It is only above 700 \u00b0C that the partial oxidation products CO and H 2 were detected (reaction (3)). (2) CH 4 + 2 O 2 \u2194 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O (3) CH 4 + 0.5 O 2 \u2194 CO + 2 H 2 A blank run demonstrated that a gas-phase reaction occurred only at 800 \u00b0C or higher to form the total oxidation products of CO 2 and H 2 O, and also partial oxidation products of CO and H 2 . Therefore, the syngas formed at high temperatures when applying the methane\u2013oxygen mixture partially contributed to the non-catalytic gaseous phase reaction. Since the indirect methane oxidation requires the intermediate products CO and H 2 as the fuels for electro-oxidation, the anode electro-oxidation was unlikely to proceed via the indirect route at a temperature lower than 700 \u00b0C by applying methane\u2013oxygen mixture as the fuel. When humidified methane was applied as the fuel, the anode performance was based on the indirect oxidation mechanism and is closely related with the anode activity for methane steam and CO 2 reforming. Fig. 8 b shows the temperature dependence of methane and CO 2 conversion using the LSSM catalyst. There is no reaction below 750 \u00b0C. The methane conversion reached 10.4 and 26.6% for steam and CO 2 reforming at 900 \u00b0C, respectively. This suggests an operating temperature >750 \u00b0C is necessary for a LSSM anode when operating on humidified methane if the anode reaction proceeds through the indirect way. These reactions can be written as reactions [4] and [5] . (4) CH 4 + H 2 O \u2194 CO + 3 H 2 (5) CH 4 + CO 2 \u2194 2 CO + 2 H 2 3.5 Single fuel cell performance and redox stability Complete cells using pure LSSM as the material for both cathode and anode on ScSZ electrolyte were built. Fig. 9 shows the I\u2013V and I\u2013W curves using 3% H 2 O humidified H 2 and CH 4 as fuel and ambient air as the cathode atmosphere. The cell delivered favorable power densities of 310 and 130 mW cm \u22122 at 900 \u00b0C, 220 and 100 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C with humidified H 2 and CH 4 as the fuels, respectively. We introduced a little oxygen with the methane at a ratio of 5:1 into the anode atmosphere to avoid coke formation, but the power density of the cell decreased to only \u223c50 mW cm \u22122 and the cell demonstrated a relatively low OCV of 0.68 V at 850 \u00b0C. This suggests that the oxygen might not be totally converted under such conditions. We will discuss the low OCV values in detail later. An advantage of perovskites over Ni-based anodes is their high redox stabilities. Symmetric SOFC cells with LSSM as both anode and cathode delivered stable performance for at least 120 min by applying humidified methane without carbon formation, which may be related to the high redox stability of LSSM as demonstrated by XRD. The redox stability of LSSM anode in methane\u2013air cycles was further investigated by impedance tests. As shown in Fig. 10 a and b, after four cycles with a total time of \u223c4 h, the values and shapes of the EIS curves were not obviously changed either in air or methane atmospheres, suggesting a remarkable redox stability of LSSM in these cycles. Fig. 11 is a comparison of measured OCVs with the theoretic values when using a 3% humidified H 2 or CH 4 gas as the fuel and air as the cathode atmospheres. Theoretical values were calculated from the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of the mixture gas, CH 4 , CO, O 2 , H 2 O, according to Refs. [41,47] . The OCV for methane fuel increased with increasing temperature, opposite to the trend when operating on H 2 fuel. Furthermore, measured OCVs for methane fuel were much lower than the theoretical values. Since the measured OCV values for hydrogen fuel were close to the theoretical value, the relatively low OCV for methane fuel was unlikely due to a sealing problem. The relatively low OCV for methane fuel can be attributed to the following two aspects. The first one is due to the microstructure of anode material, a failure of the fuel gas mixture to react completely to form the equilibrium gas mixture, so that the P O2 in the fuel gas differed from the P O2 which would be present if the mixture had reached thermodynamic equilibrium. The second one which is more reasonable is that the theoretical OCVs were calculated based on the oxygen potentials of the surrounding atmospheres of the electrodes. Actually, the measured OCV was determined by the oxygen potential difference over the both electrode surfaces. When pure hydrogen was applied as the fuel, the hydrogen concentration over the anode surface was similar to the atmosphere; therefore similar values of the theoretical and measured OCVs were observed. By applying a more complicated gas system (methane for example), as the anode atmosphere, the different adsorption capabilities of various components derived from methane (such as CO, H 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 ) may result in different concentrations over the anode surface. Consequently, a deviation of the OCVs from the theoretical calculations based on the oxygen potential in the atmosphere could be observed. To demonstrate the different adsorption capabilities of CO 2 , H 2 O, H 2 , CO and CH 4 over a LSSM surface, a temperature-programmed desorption technique was adopted. This technique was conducted by first pre-treating the fresh LSSM oxide in a mixed gas atmosphere composed of CO 2 , H 2 O and CH 4 in 1:1:1 volume ratio for a period of 1 h at 120 \u00b0C, then cooled down to room temperature under the same atmosphere. Helium was then switched on to get rid of weakly adsorbed species. With the programmed temperature increase, the adsorbed gas was progressively released from the oxide surface. The stronger interaction of adsorbed gases with the surface, a higher temperature is needed to desorb the gases from the oxide surface. Fig. 12 shows the temperature-programmed desorption curves of various gases. At lower temperatures (<500 \u00b0C), strong CO 2 and H 2 O desorption peaks were observed. A much weaker desorption peak of methane was also observed ( Fig. 12 inset). This implies that methane had a much weaker adsorption capability on the LSSM surface than CO 2 and H 2 O. At T > 800 \u00b0C, a strong CO 2 desorption peak together with many weak peaks of CH 4 , CO and O 2 were observed. CO 2 was produced from the decomposition of surface carbonates. It was found that no any high-temperature CH 4 desorption peak was observed when applying pure methane as the pre-treatment gas at 800 \u00b0C. This suggests that the CH 4 desorption peak at 800 \u00b0C for the sample pre-treated in the mixed gases is unlikely due to the surface adsorbed CH 4 . The surface reactions (6) and (7) are then proposed. (6) CO 2 + 2 H 2 O \u2192 CH 4 + 2 O 2 (7) 2 CO 2 \u2192 2 CO + O 2 The much stronger adsorption capability of CO 2 and H 2 O than H 2 and CH 4 on the LSSM surface may account for the much lower measured OCV value than expected theoretical values. With a decrease in operating temperature, the adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O on the LSSM surface became stronger while fewer fuels (CO, H 2 ) could be adsorbed on the LSSM surface. Consequently, an increase of oxygen potential over the anode surface could be expected. This explains the drop of OCV with decreasing temperature when applying methane as the fuel. On the other hand, the absorption of CO 2 and H 2 O can block more reducing gases (CO, H 2 ) from contacting with LSSM surface to protect the operating stability of the electrode. 4 Conclusions A novel perovskite oxide La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 3 (LSSM) was synthesized and evaluated as simultaneous cathode and anode materials for solid-oxide fuel cells. LSSM has considerable stability in both cathode and anode operating conditions. Under a reducing atmosphere, Mn 4+ in LSSM will be reduced mainly to Mn 3+ while it could be further reduced to Mn 2+ in LSM. All these stabilities are attributed to backbone action of Sc 3+ in the perovskite lattice structure. Similar to LSM oxide, LSSM exhibits stable conductivity in a wide range of oxygen partial pressure. At 850 \u00b0C, conductivity values are \u223c45 and \u223c6.1 S cm \u22121 , respectively, in air and wet 5% H 2 /Ar, higher than that of LSCM at similar conditions. As a candidate anode material, it was demonstrated that LSSM is active for methane combustion. As a cathode, the area specific polarization resistance of pure LSSM on ScSZ electrolyte at 850 \u00b0C is 0.18 \u03a9 cm 2 when tested under a 400 mA cm \u22122 cathodic current passage. Surface oxygen ion diffusion may be the main rate-determining step for the oxygen reduction on LSSM. The peak power densities of a single cell simultaneously using LSSM as cathode and anode with a 0.3 mm ScSZ electrolyte are 310 and 130 mW cm 2 at 900 \u00b0C with wet H 2 and CH 4 fuel. All results show that LSSM is a promising electrode for symmetrical fuel cell applications.

        "abstract": "Pure-phase spinel-type lithium titanate, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , was successfully fabricated by cellulose-assisted glycine-nitrate (cellulose-GN) combustion process at reduced temperature using anatase TiO 2 solid as raw material of titanium. The influence of cellulose and impregnation sequence on the phase purity, particle size and electrochemical performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was investigated. The sequence of preparation was found to have big effect on the phase formation and electrochemical performance of the oxides. High-purity and well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxides were obtained at a calcination temperature of 750 \u00b0C via the sequence III, for which the cellulose was first adsorbed by the mixed solution of LiNO 3 and glycine followed by the impregnation of TiO 2 suspension. Compared with solid-state reaction, the cellulose-GN process produced the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxides with smaller particle size and higher specific capacity due to the lower synthesis temperature. A reversible capacity of 103 mAh/g at 20 C rate and fairly stable cycling performance even at 40 C was achieved. Keywords Lithium-ion battery Anode Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 Combustion synthesis Electrochemical performance 1 Introduction An extensive research effort has been paying to rechargeable batteries for applications in hybrid electric vehicles and as dispersed energy storage system [1,2] . These applications demand high charge/discharge rates, long cycling life, and high safety. Among the many types of batteries, lithium-ion batteries have acquired particular interests recently for their high power and energy density [3,4] . State-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries compose of a graphite/carbon related anode [5\u20138] , which, however, have serious safety concerns for large-size applications. For example, they suffer from a lack of end-of-charge indictor in their voltage profile. Furthermore, due to the low lithium intercalating voltage of approximately 100 mV, highly reactive metallic lithium forms easily under fast charge rate, which has the high risk to react with the electrolyte or highly charged cathode [9,10] . Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is regarded as an ideal anode material with long cycling stability due to the small lattice parameter variation during lithium intercalation into and de-intercalation from the oxide lattice [11] . Moreover, it has a discharge platform at about 1.55 V versus Li + /Li, above the reduction potential of most electrolyte solvents. Thereby, it does not form high-resistant passive films from the reduction of electrolyte on the electrode surface [12] . For the same reason, it can also avoid the formation of metallic lithium during the discharge process [13] . A well developed crystallinity is a pre-requisite for a stable and reliable performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode since the charge/discharge processes involve the Li insertion into/extraction from the oxide lattice. Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is typically synthesized via solid-phase reaction applying TiO 2 and Li 2 CO 3 /Li(OH) as the raw materials [14] . It has the advantages of simple synthesis, facile scale up, well-crystallized sample and cheap raw materials. However, it also suffers from high calcination temperature, large grain size, impurity phases and lithium evaporation [15] . Large polarization resistance was typically observed at high charge/discharge rate for large-grain Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 because of its poor electronic conductivity. To solve this problem, many kinds of surface techniques have been exploited to increase the electronic conductivity of the oxide, especially the carbon coating [16\u201318] . However, the surface coating could result in a substantial decrease in packing density of the oxide. Consequently, a reduction in volumetric energy density is frequently experienced. Another effective way to increase the rate performance is to develop nano-crystallite Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 by advanced synthesis [19,20,15] . The reduction in particle size can lessen diffusion distance for the lithium ion inside the oxide, and also increase the area for surface reaction. Sol\u2013gel method, characterized by low synthesis temperature and high surface area of the resulted oxide, has been widely exploited [15,21] . However, electrochemical behavior of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is closely related with its crystallinity. Since the low-temperature calcination typically resulted in a poor development of crystallinity of the oxide, a further heat treatment at high temperature is frequently adopted. Moreover, the sol\u2013gel method typically applies expensive organic reagents as reactants, which is economically unattractive for large-scale application. As the most abundant renewable polysaccharide in nature with a yield of 9.5 million tones per year, cotton cellulose is widely applied in the chemical synthesis process recently. Previously we have successfully applied cotton cellulose as a bio-reactor for synthesizing nano-crystallite doped ceria for fuel cell application [22] . In this study, we report the successful synthesis of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 by adopting anatase-type TiO 2 solid as the reactant via a glycine-nitrate-cellulose combustion process (cellulose-GN process). This technique has both the advantages of solid-state reaction and sol\u2013gel method, i.e., simple synthesis, low-temperature calcination, cheap raw materials and good electrochemical performance at high charge/discharge rates. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials synthesis LiNO 3 (AR) and anatase-type TiO 2 solid with a particle size of \u223c10 nm (specific surface area: 88.3 m 2 g \u22121 ) were applied as the raw materials for the Li and Ti sources, respectively. Cotton fiber was applied as the cellulose source, which was activated by HNO 3 with the same way as reported in our earlier publication [23] . As shown in Fig. 1 , three different impregnation sequences were adopted to synthesize the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide by the cellulose-assisted glycine-nitrate combustion process or called as cellulose-GN process. Sequence I : Required amounts of TiO 2 solid, HNO 3 , LiNO 3 and glycine were prepared into a suspension under magnetic stirring and dropped into the activated cellulose fiber slowly; after thoroughly impregnated, the cellulose was dried at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h. The obtained solid precursor is named as SP-I. Sequence II : TiO 2 nano-powder was dispersed in water to form a suspension, which was then dropped to the cellulose fiber slowly allowing it to be thoroughly adsorbed by the cellulose; after drying at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h, the cellulose fiber was further impregnated with a mixed solution of HNO 3 + Li(NO 3 ) + glycine and dried again at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h. The as-obtained solid precursor is named as SP-II. Sequence III : The cellulose was first impregnated with a mixed solution of LiNO 3 and glycine; after drying, it was further impregnated with a suspension of TiO 2 and HNO 3 and dried at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h. The as-obtained solid precursor is named as SP-III. For all three processes, the mole ratio of glycine to HNO 3 to total metal ions kept at 3:3:1. The solid precursors were then put into a pre-heated electrical oven at 250 \u00b0C to trigger the auto combustion. A K-type thermocouple was embedded into the sample which was connected with a Yudian thermometer (Xiamen, China) interfaced with computer via Labview program to monitor the instant temperature change. The temperature data acquisition system was capable for recording four data points of instant temperature per second during the auto combustion processes. The as-obtained primary products were grinded and then further calcinated at various temperatures for 3\u20135 h in air. For comparison, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was also synthesized by a solid-state reaction applying anatase TiO 2 and Li 2 CO 3 as the raw materials for the Li and Ti sources, respectively. 2.2 Electrode fabrication The electrochemical cycling performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders was carried out with coin-shape cells using metallic lithium film as the counter and reference electrode at room temperature (\u223c30 \u00b0C). The cells are based on the configuration of Li metal (\u2212)|electrolyte| Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (+) with a liquid electrolyte (1 M solution of LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)\u2013dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1, v/v)). Microporous polypropylene film (Celgard 2400) was used as the separator [24] . 85 wt.% Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 with 10 wt.% conductive Super P (NCM HERSBIT Chemical Co., Ltd., China) and 5 wt.% LA-132 binder (Chengdu organic chemicals Co., Ltd., China) in de-ionized water were prepared into viscous slurries for efficient deposition. The slurries were deposited on current collectors of copper foil (10 \u03bcm) by blade, which was pretreated by etching with 1 M nitric acid solutions followed by rinsing with water and then acetone. The electrode was then dried under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h before electrochemical evaluation. Cell assembly was conducted in a glove box filled with pure argon. 2.3 Characterization The crystal structures of the synthesized powders were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with filtered Cu k\u03b1 radiation. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning in the range of 10\u00b0 < 2 \u03b8 < 80\u00b0. The particulate morphology was examined by Environmental Scanning Electronic Microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The charge\u2013discharge characteristics of the cells were recorded over the potential range between 1.0 and 3.0 V using a NEWARE BTS-5V50mA computer-controlled battery test station at different rates of 1\u201340 C at 30 \u00b0C. Cyclic voltammetry tests were performed over the potential range of 1.0\u20133.0 V using a Princeton Applied Research PARSTAT 2273 advanced electrochemical system at the scanning rate of 0.1\u20132 mV s \u22121 . 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis After the impregnation and drying, the solid precursors prepared from all the three impregnation sequences still took the geometric shape of cotton fiber as observed by bare eyes. The impregnated cellulose fiber became much harder as compared to the fresh ones. Shown in Fig. 2 are the SEM photos of the activated cellulose and the three precursors. The activated cellulose was in flat fiber shape while it became round shape after the impregnation. This implies that the reactants have been successfully impregnated into the cotton fiber. When no cellulose was applied during the synthesis, the precursor was in a viscous paste state. This suggests certain type of interaction between cellulose and GN might exist in the cellulose-GN solid precursor. It is likely that the hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) in cellulose's structure successfully anchored the GN complex to the cellulose surface via the formation of a certain type of metal\u2013oxygen bonds [25] . The solid precursors were then put into a pre-heated electrical oven at 250 \u00b0C to allow them be fast heated up. For SP-I and SP-III, a sudden ignition was happened with the appearance of combustion flame after about 1.2\u20131.5 min from introducing into the oven. The combustion flame lasted for about 10 s. Followed on, occasional sparks alongside with simultaneous production of large amount of smog were observed, which last for several minutes. Shown in Fig. 3 are the corresponding temperature profiles of the samples during the heat treatment. The temperature profiles for SP-I and SP-III combustion processes are similar to each other. During the initial stage, the sample temperature increased slowly, associated with the slow evaporation of residual water and frees HNO 3 in the solid precursors. At around 1.25 and 1.4 min when the SP-I and SP-III reached a temperature of 62 and 61 \u00b0C, respectively, a sudden increase of the temperature was occurred to a maximum of 450 (for SP-I) and \u223c 500 \u00b0C (for SP-III), with the simultaneous appearance of combustion flame. However, the combustion behavior of SP-II was very different. The temperature increased slowly with time to a maximum temperature of 300 \u00b0C, just 50 \u00b0C higher than the oven. No combustion flame was observed during the whole process, although we did observe occasional sparks in the precursor accompanied with release of smog. When the cotton fibers were first impregnated with TiO 2 , the fine TiO 2 particles socked into the inner pores and also covered the outer surface of the cellulose fiber. Due to the block effect of the pre-socked TiO 2 , the glycine and LiNO 3 were then mainly accumulated on the outer surface of the cellulose fiber. During the heating, LiNO 3 was easily decomposed and resulted in the loss of the NO 3 \u2212 oxidant that is necessary for the auto combustion. Consequently, no obvious combustion flame was observed for SP-II. After the auto-combustion, there were a lot of white powders alongside with some charred organic in the primary products from SP-I and SP-III. After grinded, the products took the color of gray. However, there was a lot of un-combusted organic in the product from SP-II. It took the color of black after the grinding. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the primary products after the auto-combustion from the three different preparation sequences. When the TiO 2 was impregnated first (sequence II), the diffraction patterns of the primary product still showed the main phase of anatase-type TiO 2 . It implies the reaction between LiNO 3 and TiO 2 did not occur during this process. It may be due to the low temperature (\u223c300 \u00b0C) of the smothering combustion process. When the cellulose was impregnated with a suspension composed of LiNO 3 , HNO 3 , glycine and TiO 2 (sequence I), an intermediate phase of Li\u2013Ti\u2013O spinel-type oxide, most likely Li 2 TiO 3 according to literature [26] , started to appear alongside with the anatase-type TiO 2 . The impregnation of cellulose with LiNO 3 and glycine first (sequence III), the primary product displayed the most well developed Li\u2013Ti\u2013O spinel phase. Such phase development behaviors are closely related with the combustion temperature. For SP-I and SP-III, high combustion temperatures of 450 and 500 \u00b0C were reached, which facilitated the reaction between TiO 2 and LiNO 3 or the in situ created LiOH or Li 2 CO 3 to form Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The highest intensity of diffraction peaks of the Li\u2013Ti\u2013O spinel phase from SP-III is in well agreement with the highest combustion temperature (\u223c500 \u00b0C) as measured by the thermocouple observed during the combustion. It should be mentioned that the instant temperature during the auto combustion for SP-I and SP-III could be much higher than that indicated by the thermocouple due to the time-lag for the heat to transfer from the precursor to the thermocouple and the short combustion period (\u223c10 s). It is well known that anatase-type TiO 2 is easy to have phase transition to rutile-type TiO 2 at high temperatures especially with the presence of foreign cation(s) [27] . It is interesting that TiO 2 after the auto-combustion still took an anatase-type phase structure, which could be attributed to the short combustion time. Since anatase-type TiO 2 has much higher Li diffusion coefficient than rutile-type TiO 2 [28] , it is beneficial for the formation of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 during the following calcination. The as-obtained primary products were submitted for further calcination at 750 \u00b0C for 5 h. For comparison, the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was also prepared by a solid-state reaction applying Li 2 CO 3 and the same anatase-type TiO 2 as the raw materials and calcinated at 750 \u00b0C for 5 h. As shown in Fig. 5 , the products from SP-I and SP-II displayed small amount of rutile-type TiO 2 . The appearance of very weak diffraction peak at 2 \u03b8 = 27.65\u00b0 in Fig. 5 c indicates still presence of little amount of rutile TiO 2 in the product originated from SP-III, although it was much weak than the samples from SP-I and SP-II. This may be originated from the a little loss of Li when fired at 750 \u00b0C. However, phase analysis results show that the as-synthesized powder contains less than 1% of rutile TiO 2 along with Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . And from the further charge\u2013discharge characteristics and cyclic voltammetry test, we found no other platform and redox peak, which suggested the small amount of secondary phase did not have noticeable effect on the electrochemical properties of the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . As to the product from the solid-state reaction, considerable amount of rutile-type TiO 2 was observed. In literature, calcination at 850 \u00b0C for 24 h was typically applied for the synthesis of pure-phase Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 by solid-phase reaction. Fig. 6 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the mixed Li 2 CO 3 and anatase-type TiO 2 precursor calcinated at 850 \u00b0C for various hours in air. It was found that small amount of rutile-type TiO 2 was still detected after the calcination at 850 \u00b0C for 12 h. A pure-phase Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 was obtained only after a prolonged calcination at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h. Our results agreed with the literature pretty well. Above results suggest that the current cellulose-assisted combustion synthesis could reduce the synthesis of pure and well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide obviously. It could be in part attributed to the instant high temperature created during the auto-combustion, which facilitated the phase formation of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide for SP-I and SP-III. The better phase formation for the cellulose-GN process via sequence II than the solid-state reaction suggests that the metal ions may be also more homogeneously mixed via the cellulose-GN process. It is well known that the evaporation of lithium at temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C is evident; therefore, excess amount of lithium is normally applied in the case of solid-state reaction to avoid the lithium deficiency. By the current technique, pure-phase spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 can be formed at \u223c750 \u00b0C for a short heat treatment time of 5 h, which greatly increased the precise stoichiometry of the oxide by effectively controlling the formation of liquid Li 2 CO 3 during the synthesis. Fig. 7 shows the SEM photos of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 sample prepared by the solid-state reaction at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h and the sample prepared by cellulose-GN reaction at 750 \u00b0C for 5 h. Both samples are in quasi-sphere shape, it then ensures a high packing density. The powder prepared from the solid-state reaction was seriously sintered with the primary grain size of about 1\u20132 \u03bcm. The sample prepared by the cellulose-assisted GN combustion process has the main particle size of 0.2\u20130.8 \u03bcm. Such a difference in particulate morphology could be in part contributed from their different calcination temperatures applied. 3.2 Electrochemical performance The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide powder from cellulose-GN process prepared via sequence III after calcination at 750 \u00b0C for 5 h was then adopted for electrochemical performance test. For comparison, the performance of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode from solid-phase reaction after calcination at 850 \u00b0C for 17 h was also investigated. Shown in Fig. 8 are the first and second charge\u2013discharge curves. Both anodes exhibited first discharge capacity of \u223c170 mAh/g between 1.0 and 3.0 V at 1 C discharge rate, very close to the theoretical capacity 175 mAh/g [28] . Although a small irreversible capacity was observed for both anodes in the first cycle, which might be due to an irreversible electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte or the impurity phase over the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 surface, the coulombic efficiency of charge and discharge was near 100% for the following cycles. The flat charge and discharge curves, intrinsic electrochemical properties of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 spinel-based anode based on two-phase mechanism, were observed at 1.55 and 1.52 V versus Li/Li + , respectively. The similar performance of the two anodes prepared by the different methods suggests that the ionic and electronic diffusion is not a serious problem at relatively low charge/discharge rate of 1 C. To get the information of their cycling behavior at higher charge/discharge rates, the rate capability of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anodes was evaluated at ambient temperature of 30 \u00b0C for five different discharge\u2013charge current rates corresponding to the \u2018 C \u2019 values of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 C, here 1 C is 170 mA/g, in the voltage range 1.0\u20133.0 V. Shown in Fig. 9 are the corresponding discharge curves for Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode prepared by cellulose-assisted GN process. Excellent high-rate performance was observed. At the discharge rate of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 C, the reversible capacities reached 158, 138, 122, 103, 80 mAh/g, respectively. As to the cell with the material prepared by solid-state reaction, it showed comparable reversible discharge capacities at discharge rate of 2 C. Under such circumstances, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 grains inside the agglomerated particles were still electroactive. However, with the increase of the charge\u2013discharge current rate to 5 C or higher the difference between the lithium storage capacities of them became evident. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 powders prepared by cellulose-GN process behave a slow capacity fading upon increasing the current density. However, the capacity of the solid-state reaction sample dropped very rapidly, the reversible capacity decrease considerably to a minimum of 37 mAh/g at 40 C discharge rate, as a comparison of 80 mAh/g for the anode prepared from the cellulose-assisted GN combustion synthesis. It is believed that a large portion of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 grains became inactive during charge\u2013discharge in the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode synthesized by solid-state reaction due to the poor ionic conductivity and long diffusion distance. The much better high-rate performance of cellulose-GN derived Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 is well expected because of its reduced crystallite size, as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 10 shows the cyclic voltammograms of cell using the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode from the calcination of SP-III at 750 \u00b0C in a galvanostatic charge/discharge process, at the scanning rate of 0.1, 0.2 and 1 mV/s, such scanning rates equal to charge/discharge rates of \u223c0.2, 0.4 and 2 C, respectively. Only on oxidation/reduction peak is observed, which was coincided with the single phase of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 after the calcination at 750 \u00b0C as shown in Fig. 6 . The cathodic peak located around 1.5 V at 0.1 mV/s, which moved steady to the lower voltage with the increase of scanning rate, corresponds to the voltage platform of the discharge process in which Li intercalated into the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The anodic peak at 1.66 V corresponds to the voltage platform of the charge process in which Li de-intercalated from the spinel Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 . The excellent cycling performance was further supported by the reversible discharge capacity versus cycle number as shown in Fig. 11 . Because different cells were adopted for the cycling life test, a small difference in capacity at 1 C rate in Fig. 11 from Fig. 8 a and Fig. 9 a was observed. During the discharge-charge cycles between 1.0 and 3.0 V from 1 to 40 C for 50 times, the sample demonstrated a remarkably stable rate capacity. After 50 cycles, compared to the second cycle, the discharge capacity kept nearly 100%. Fig. 12 shows the cyclic voltammaograms of cell using the 750 \u00b0C calcinated Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode at the scanning rate of 2 mV/s between 1.0 and 2.5 V, such a scanning rate equals to a charge/discharge rate of 5 C in a galvanostatic charge/discharge process. As show in Fig. 12 , the cyclic voltammetric curves repeated with each other very well for the cycle 2 to cycle 50. It further supports the high reversibility and stability of the Li-intercalation and de-intercalation through the cellulose-GN 750 \u00b0C sample. Above results then high promise the application of cellulose-GN method for the synthesis of nano-crystallite for high-rate rechargeable lithium battery application. 4 Conclusions The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxides have been successfully prepared by a cellulose-assisted glycine-nitrate combustion (cellulose-GN) process applying anatase-type TiO 2 solid as raw material of titanium. The preparation sequence had obvious effect on the phase formation of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide. The optimal sequence is the cellulose was first impregnated with a mixed solution of LiNO 3 and glycine, after drying, it was further impregnated with a suspension of TiO 2 and HNO 3 and dried at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h. Pure phase and well-crystallized Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 oxide was obtained at a reduced calcination temperature of 750 \u00b0C for 5 h. The oxide delivered a high discharge capacity of \u223c170 mAh/g at 1 C rate and even 103 mAh/g at 20 C. It also had much better high-rate performance than the oxide prepared by the solid-state reaction applying similar raw materials. Such improvement was attributed to the lower synthesis temperature by the cellulose-assisted combustion process. Pretty well cycling performance was also observed. Due to the simple synthesis, low prices of raw materials and low temperature synthesis, the cellulose-GN process was demonstrated to be highly promising for practical application.

        "abstract": "La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-\u03b4 powder was synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing process via low-temperature auto-combustion synthesis with NH4NO3 as an oxidizer and a combustion trigger. Two novel methods were explored to improve this auto-combustion technology with reduced NH4NO3 addition: the use of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-\u03b4 as the combustion catalyst and the application of asymmetric sol-gel process to provide the precursor with different NH4NO3 concentrations. The prepared perovskite powder was characterized by BET, SEM, XRD and iodometric titration techniques. The catalytic performance of the powder was also examined in the decomposition of peroxide hydrogen. Experimental results indicate that powders from catalytic combustion and asymmetric precursor routes have more advantages in terms of better crystallites, higher specific surface area, higher B-site valence state, improved sintering capability and better catalytic performance in peroxide hydrogen decomposition than that from the synthesis with uniform NH4NO3 distribution. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

        "abstract": "A facile EDTA-citrate complexing process with in situ created recyclable NiO as inorganic template was developed for the synthesis of mesoporous samaria-doped ceria (SDC) at high temperatures. By applying metal nitrates as the raw materials for the cation sources and EDTA and citric acid as the chelants, the molecular-level homogeneous mixing of the metal ions was successfully preserved to the solid precursor. Low-temperature calcination resulted in the formation of mixture oxides of nano-size SDC and NiO oxides, as demonstrated by XRD, FT-IR and BET analysis. A possible mechanism for the formation of mesoporous SDC was proposed, in which the SDC particles surrounded the nano-size NiO grains and sintered during the high-temperature calcination. Dissolving the coated NiO in SDC and self-aggregated NiO particulates from the mixture with diluted HNO 3 resulted in a porous pure-phase SDC oxide. At optimal SDC to NiO ratios, mesoporous, thermally stable and well-crystallized SDC powder with narrow pore size distribution and high surface area was synthesized.",

Thermo-mechanical compatibility between the two electrode layers and between the electrode and the electrolyte were examined by SEM, XRD and EIS. After sintering, no clear boundary between SScC\u00a0+\u00a0SDC and SScC\u00a0+\u00a0SmSC layers was observable by SEM. The repeated thermal cycling didn't induce the delamination of the electrode from the electrolyte nor the formation of cracks within the electrode. As a result, stable electrode performance was achieved during thermal cycling and long-term operation.

        "title": "Coke formation and performance of an intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell operating on dimethyl ether fuel",
        "abstract": "Dimethyl ether (DME) as a fuel of SOFCs is investigated with great attention paid to coke formation over the Ni-YSZ anode. DME is easily decomposed to CH 4 , CO and H 2 at temperatures above 700 \u00b0C, with total conversion occurring at 850 \u00b0C over the Ni-YSZ catalyst. These data suggest that the DME electro-oxidation likely proceeds via an indirect pathway. O 2 -TPO analysis, laser Raman spectroscopy and SEM\u2013EDX characterizations demonstrate coke formation over Ni-YSZ, which is obvious and become more prevalent at higher temperatures. The introduction of CO 2 in the fuel gas decreases the CH 4 selectivity and effectively suppresses coke formation above 700 \u00b0C. The suppression effect is increasingly apparent at higher temperatures. At 850 \u00b0C, the anode still maintains geometric integrity after exposure to DME\u2013CO 2 (1:1, volume ratio) under OCV condition. With DME or DME\u2013CO 2 , the fuel cell power output is comparable to results obtained by operating with 3% water humidified hydrogen. No obvious cell degradation from the anode is observed when operating with DME\u2013CO 2 , while it is obvious with DME. The introduction of CO 2 may be a good choice to suppress the coke formation when operating on DME; however, the proper selection of operation temperature is of significant importance. Keywords Dimethyl ether Solid oxide fuel cell Coke formation Anode Reforming 1 Introduction With ever-diminishing oil resources and increasing environmental pollution from the inefficient burning of fossil fuels, it is crucial to find alternative and cleaner fuels and develop more efficient energy conversion techniques for a sustainable world. Recently, oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as ethers and alcohols, have been receiving increasing attention as alternative fuels [1\u20135] . Among them, dimethyl ether (DME) is of particular interest [6\u20138] because it is the simplest ether and possesses physical properties similar to those of liquefied petroleum gases, such as propane and butane. DME exists as a gas at normal conditions and is easily liquefied under 0.6 MPa of pressure at room temperature. In the liquid phase, it shows a larger volumetric and gravimetric energy density than methanol [6] . Furthermore, DME is free of sulfur, heavy metals and other impurities. Reduced NO x , SO x , CO, formaldehyde, particulates and non-methane hydrocarbon emissions are expected to result from replacing current fossil fuels with DME. As a secondary fuel, DME can be synthesized from primary fuels such as natural gas, coal and biomass through gasification or reforming integrated with a chemical synthesis. DME is an excellent clean energy carrier of coal and is believed to be a potential fuel for the 21 century [9] . The application of DME as an alternative fuel for gas turbines, internal combustion engines and diesel engines has been explored recently [10\u201312] . Fuel cells are electrochemical energy conversion devices which can generate electric power from chemical fuels with much higher efficiency and significantly lower emissions relative to conventional fire power plants [13] . Low-temperature direct DME fuel cells have been extensively investigated as a potential alternative to direct methanol fuel cells for portable application [14\u201319] . In such fuel cells, a polymer electrolyte is applied and the DME is directly oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O at low temperature. Compared to direct methanol fuel cells, direct DME fuel cells are less toxic and less explosive. In addition, they exhibit less fuel crossover through Nafion membrane and a higher energy density. However, DME is also less active than methanol during oxidation on conventional catalysts at normal fuel cell operational conditions and, as a result, low cell power density is obtained [20,21] . Recently, DME has also been investigated as a fuel for high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) without the external reforming process [22] , high power output was achieved. However, one practical problem associated with SOFC supplied directly with DME fuel is the coke formation that occurs over the nickel-based cermet anode. It is interesting that Murray et al. reported no coke formation on the anode of a SOFC operating on DME without an external reforming process at temperatures up to 700 \u00b0C [22] . However, thermodynamically, coke formation is unavoidable. Murray et al. indeed observed higher mole fractions of CO and H 2 than CH 4 at temperature lower than 700 \u00b0C, suggesting the possible formation of solid carbon. They believed that the oxygen ion current was high enough to oxidize any carbon deposited at the anode during the fuel cell operation. In principle, under open circuit conditions, no oxygen transports from the cathode to the anode, accumulation of solid carbon is then likely to happen. Especially for a long-term operation, coke formation continues to be a major concern. However, to date, the literature lacks a systematic investigation of the carbon deposition over the SOFC anode. In this study, DME was applied as a fuel of an intermediate-temperature Ni-YSZ cermet anode-supported SOFCs. The coke formation over the Ni-YSZ cermet anode was systematically investigated. The effect of internal reforming of DME with CO 2 on the cell performance and coke formation over the anode was also studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathode material for SOFC was synthesized by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [23] , while NiO and (Y 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (YSZ) oxide powders were purchased as commercial products (Chengdu Shudu Nano-Science Co., Ltd., China for NiO and Tosoh for YSZ). To fabricate the single cells, a tape-casting method was adopted to prepare the green anode substrates, which were fired at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h to release the organic compounds and create sufficient mechanical strength. The electrolyte (YSZ) slurries were then spray-deposited onto the anode substrate using a modified spraying gun (BD-128, Fenghua Bida Machinery Manufacture Co. Ltd., China). The green anode-electrolyte dual layer cells were co-fired at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h to sinter the electrolyte layer. Finally, the LSM (1000 \u00b0C calcined)-YSZ composite cathode was spray deposited onto the electrolyte surface in a round shape and fired at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h. The effective geometric surface area is \u223c0.48 cm 2 . 2.2 Catalytic evaluation The thermal and catalytic decomposition of DME, CO 2 reforming of DME, and CO 2 reforming of methane was tested in a flow-through type fixed-bed quartz-tube reactor (ID: 8 mm) using Ni-YSZ cermet as the catalyst in the temperature range from 600 \u00b0C to 850 \u00b0C. After sintering at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h (to ensure the properties similar to the anode in a real fuel cell), the NiO-YSZ anode powder was pressed into disks and milled into pellets of 40\u201360 mesh for the catalytic tests. Approximately 0.2 g of catalyst particles was placed into the middle of the reactor. Mixtures of DME, CO 2 , He and CH 4 at the ratios of DME:CO 2 :He = 10:10:80 (DME CO 2 reforming), DME:He = 10:80 (DME decomposition) and CH 4 :CO 2 :He = 10:10:80 (methane CO 2 reforming) were introduced from the top of the reactor. For the catalytic test, the DME and methane flow rates were fixed at 10 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The respective gas flow rate was controlled by AFC 80MD digital mass flow controllers (Qualiflow). The effluent gases from the reactor were introduced to an on-line Varian 3800 gas chromatograph (GC) for compositional analysis. The GC was equipped with Hayesep Q, Poraplot Q and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve capillary columns, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the detection of H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , CO and CH 4 , and a flame ionization detector (FID) for analyzing DME. 2.3 Characterizations For the carbon deposition tests, \u223c0.2 g Ni-YSZ particles were first placed in a flow-through type quartz-tube reactor (ID: 8 mm). The samples were then treated at various temperatures between 650 and 850 \u00b0C under pure DME or DME\u2013CO 2 (1:1, volume ratio) for 30 min with a constant DME flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP]. After the treatment, the samples were cooled to room temperature under the protection of a helium atmosphere. Approximately 0.02 g of the powder from the treatment in DME or DME\u2013CO 2 atmosphere was placed into a U-type quartz reactor (ID: 4 mm). A gas mixture containing 10 vol.% O 2 in Ar (10 vol.% O 2 \u2013Ar) at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was introduced to the reactor for oxygen temperature-programmed oxidization (O 2 -TPO) of the deposited carbon over the catalyst. After flowing the gas at room temperature for 30 min, the reactor was heated to 900 \u00b0C at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The deposited solid carbon on the Ni-YSZ surface was then progressively oxidized to CO 2 . The effluent gas from the reactor was connected to a Hiden QIC-20 mass spectroscope (MS) for in situ monitoring of CO 2 . To evaluate the potential elimination of carbon deposited over the catalyst by CO 2 , the catalyst was also studied by CO 2 temperature programmed reaction (CO 2 -TPR) analysis after treatment in DME atmosphere. For a typical process, pure CO 2 was introduced to the reactor at the flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The temperature was automatically increased at the rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 , and the reaction between gaseous CO 2 and the solid carbon deposited over the catalyst proceeded. The effluent gas from the reactor was connected to an MS for on-line monitoring of the variation in CO concentration. The laser Raman spectroscopy of the Ni-YSZ powders after the treatment at various temperatures (650, 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C) under pure DME and DME\u2013CO 2 (1:1, volume ratio) for 30 min was conducted in an HR800 UV Raman microspectrometer (Jobin Yvon, France) using the green line of an argon laser ( \u03bb = 514.53 nm) as the excitation source. The morphologies of cross-sections of the fuel cells were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX) for the elemental distribution in the electrodes. The I \u2013 V polarization of the cells was measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on 4-probe mode from 850 to 650 \u00b0C. During the measurement, 3% water humidified hydrogen, pure DME or a mixture of DME\u2013CO 2 was fed to the anode chamber at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP] while ambient air was provided as the oxidant gas in the cathode chamber. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Decomposition and CO 2 reforming of DME One significant advantage of SOFCs compared to low-temperature fuel cells is the fuel flexibility. Methane, the simplest and most stable hydrocarbon, is thermally stable up to 850 \u00b0C because of the 410 kJ mol \u22121 C\u2013H bond energy. By applying methane as a fuel of SOFCs, the direct electro-oxidation of methane is possible when a proper anode material is employed [24\u201326] . CH 3 OCH 3 is the simplest oxygenated hydrocarbon in which two kinds of bonds are available, i.e., C\u2013H and C\u2013O. The much lower bond energy of C\u2013O (330 kJ mol \u22121 ) suggests that catalytic or thermal decomposition of DME should occur more readily than CH 4 . The electro-oxidation of DME over SOFC anode is believed to proceed via an indirect pathway; it is first decomposed into CH 4 , CO and H 2 , which are then electro-oxidized over the anode to produce electricity [22] . The decomposition behavior of DME was first tested at various temperatures with and without the presence of Ni-YSZ cermet. CO, CH 4 and H 2 are the main products for both thermal and catalytic decomposition of DME, in agreement with published observations [22] . As shown in Fig. 1 (a) , at 600 \u00b0C, the thermal decomposition of DME is negligible, with a DME conversion of less than 2%. In addition to CO, H 2 and CH 4 , a small amount of CO 2 was also detected at 600, 650 and 700 \u00b0C. However, it was not produced at temperatures above 700 \u00b0C. The DME conversion increased steadily with temperature and reached a value of \u223c22% at 800 \u00b0C. This result suggests that DME was already partially decomposed before reaching the fuel cell anode, especially at temperatures greater than 750 \u00b0C. The slightly higher selectivity for CO, relative to CH 4 , implies coke may also be formed during the thermal decomposition. Fig. 1 (b) shows the DME conversion and selectivities for CH 4 , CO and CO 2 at various temperatures with the presence of Ni-YSZ cermet. Compared to the blank run (thermal decomposition), a substantial increase in DME conversion was observed at all investigated temperatures, suggesting the catalytic effect of Ni-YSZ during DME decomposition. For example, the DME conversion was \u223c60% at 600 \u00b0C and \u223c94% at 800 \u00b0C. Therefore, the electro-oxidation of DME over a Ni-YSZ cermet anode in a conventional SOFC likely proceeds via an indirect pathway; the DME first decomposes to H 2 and CO before being electro-oxidized. The stoichiometric decomposition of DME to CO, H 2 and CH 4 should result in 50% selectivity for both CO and CH 4 . However, the actual CH 4 selectivity is substantially less than that of CO, even at 600 \u00b0C over Ni-YSZ cermet; this value is only \u223c3% at 850 \u00b0C. These data imply that substantial amounts of coke could be forming. This phenomenon is well understood because nickel catalyzes the cracking of hydrocarbons. The in-depth discussion about coke formation will be presented in the next section. The increase of the O/C ratio is a practical way to suppress the coke formation. CO 2 is a deep electrochemical oxidation product of DME, which has a high O-to-C ratio. In this study, CO 2 was introduced as a reforming gas for DME in order to suppress coke formation. Fig. 2 (a) shows the DME and CO 2 conversions and the selectivities for CH 4 and CO at various temperatures. Compared to the thermal decomposition of pure DME, only a slight improvement in DME conversion was observed. The CO 2 conversion was also low with a value of approximately 22% at 850 \u00b0C. These results suggest that the homogeneous gas-phase reaction between CO 2 and DME (or the decomposition products) is weak between 600 and 850 \u00b0C. Fig. 2 (b) shows the DME and CO 2 conversions and the selectivities for CH 4 and CO at various temperatures after introducing Ni-YSZ as a catalyst. The CO 2 conversion reached \u223c58% at 600 \u00b0C and increased to \u223c93% at 750 \u00b0C. These data suggest that nickel anodes catalyze the reaction between CO 2 and DME or its decomposition products. Compared to the decomposition of pure DME over Ni-YSZ cermet, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), an increase in DME conversion and a decrease in CH 4 selectivity at all corresponding temperatures were demonstrated by introducing CO 2 . Thus, CO 2 likely reacted with both DME and its decomposition products, such as methane and solid carbon. The catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ towards the CO 2 reforming of methane (CH 4 :CO 2 = 1:1) is shown in Fig. 3 . By comparison, the non-catalytic and homogeneous reaction between CH 4 and CO 2 is also presented. The CH 4 and CO 2 conversions at 800 \u00b0C are both greater than 95%. 3.2 Coke formation In principle, SOFCs can directly operate on a wide range of fuels without the external reforming process. However, coke can easily form over conventional nickel-based cermet anodes with hydrocarbon fuels. The carbon covers the active sites and leads to a fast decay in cell performance. Furthermore, the accumulation of carbon could lead to the failure of the fuel cell by destroying the geometric integrity of the cell. Based on above catalytic tests, serious coke formation is likely occurring over the Ni-YSZ catalyst when the cell is operating on pure DME fuel. The carbon deposition properties of the Ni-YSZ electrode when operating on DME fuel were first examined by treating the Ni-YSZ cermet anode powders in a pure DME atmosphere at various temperatures for 30 min. The as-obtained samples were then subjected to O 2 -TPO analysis. Fig. 4 (a) shows the O 2 -TPO profiles with the CO 2 signal. Broad CO 2 peaks were observed for all samples. The CO 2 was formed from the oxidation of the solid carbon deposited on the Ni-YSZ during the programmed heating process. Coke formation over the Ni-YSZ occurred under the open circuit conditions. An increase in the peak intensity was observed at elevated temperatures, suggesting more severe coke formation. This result can be explained by the increased reaction kinetics and agrees with the decreased CH 4 selectivity, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The enhanced carbon deposition is more clearly demonstrated by the larger CO 2 peak area at higher temperature, as listed in Table 1 . The average coke formation rate at 850 \u00b0C is greater than 3 times the rate at 650 \u00b0C. It is well known that Ni-YSZ cermet anode catalyzes methane pyrolysis at elevated temperatures [27\u201329] . Murray demonstrated that carbon deposition at high temperatures from DME fuel is likely created via an indirect pathway by the pyrolysis of CH 4 . To demonstrate the origin of the deposited carbon, Ni-YSZ was treated in CH 4 at 850 \u00b0C for 30 min; the obtained sample was studied by O 2 -TPO analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 (b), the CO 2 peak intensity for the sample treated in CH 4 is more than half of the value for the sample treated in DME. This result implies that the carbon deposition over the Ni-YSZ cermet when operating on DME fuel is not simply from the catalytic decomposition of CH 4 . The decomposition of CH 4 may partially contribute to the carbon deposited on the Ni-YSZ cermet. Fig. 5 shows the O 2 -TPO profiles of Ni-YSZ samples after treatment in DME\u2013CO 2 . The CO 2 peak intensity of Ni-YSZ after treatment at 650 and 700 \u00b0C are very similar to those that were treated in a pure DME atmosphere at the corresponding temperatures. However, with the further increase of temperature, an obvious decrease in peak intensity was observed. As shown in Table 1 , the carbon peak area is comparable for the Ni-YSZ samples after treatment in pure DME and DME\u2013CO 2 at 650 and 700 \u00b0C. These data suggest that the introduction of CO 2 did not obviously suppress coke formation over the Ni-YSZ anode at 650 and 700 \u00b0C. However, at temperatures above 700 \u00b0C, the suppression effect of CO 2 for coke formation was clearly demonstrated; less carbon was deposited at higher operation temperatures, which is contrary to operating on pure DME. At 850 \u00b0C, the amount of carbon deposited over the Ni-YSZ that was exposed to DME\u2013CO 2 is approximately 45 times less than when exposed to pure DME. The suppression effect of CO 2 for coke formation over Ni-YSZ cermet is closely related to the increased O-to-C ratio. As demonstrated in the previous section, CO 2 can react with DME and methane through the formation of syngas, decreasing the coke formed from the decomposition of DME and methane. Furthermore, CO 2 may also react with the deposited solid carbon to form gaseous CO at elevated temperature, eliminating the carbon deposited over the Ni-YSZ cermet. The reactivity of deposited carbon towards CO 2 was tested by CO 2 -TPR. The Ni-YSZ was first treated in an atmosphere of pure DME for 30 min at 850 \u00b0C. The obtained sample was then programmatically heated in pure CO 2 . Fig. 6 shows the CO 2 -TPR profile with the CO signal. The elimination of the deposited carbon by CO 2 started at \u223c540 \u00b0C. The negligible suppression effect of CO 2 on coke formation at 650 and 700 \u00b0C can be explained by the kinetic limitations. The rate of coke formation is likely much faster than the rate of coke gasification at such temperatures. The structure of the deposited carbon over the various samples after treatment in DME and DME\u2013CO 2 was investigated by the laser Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 7 , two main bands are observed in the first-order Raman spectrum of carbon materials. They are the D band (\u223c1360 cm \u22121 ) and the G band (\u223c1580 cm \u22121 ), which represent the amorphous structure and the graphite structure, respectively. The degree of structural order of the carbon can be mainly characterized by the peak integration intensity ratio in the form of R ( I D / I G ). The value of R decreases with increasing degree of the order of the carbon [30\u201332] , which are listed in Table 2 . We find that the values of R corresponding to the deposited carbon over the Ni-YSZ decreased with increasing treating temperature in both atmospheres. The values of R are 1.45 and 0.39 after the treatment in DME at 650 \u00b0C and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. These values are 1.78 and 0.53 at the corresponding temperatures, respectively, after the treatment in DME\u2013CO 2 . The results indicate that higher treatment temperatures result in deposited carbon with higher graphite structure. Meanwhile, R values of the deposited carbon after treatment in DME\u2013CO 2 are slightly larger than those corresponding to a DME atmosphere at the corresponding temperatures. These data imply that the degree of graphite structure of the deposited carbon is slightly reduced by introducing CO 2 into the DME atmosphere. An induced change in the coke formation mechanism by the presence of CO 2 in the reactant gases is also suggested. The serious carbon formation by operating with DME fuel and the suppression effect of CO 2 in the fuel over real fuel cell anode under open circuit conditions were further demonstrated by the different geometric changes of the cells after the treatment in a DME or DME\u2013CO 2 atmosphere at various temperatures for a period of 30 min. Fig. 8 shows the digital photos of a fresh anode and anodes after treatment in pure DME or DME\u2013CO 2 for 30 min at various temperatures. After treatment in pure DME, serious deformation of the anode disk was observed at temperatures above 650 \u00b0C; more serious deformation was observed at higher operating temperatures. Clearly, the deformation is due to coke formation over the anode. Table 3 lists the weight difference between the fresh cell and the cell after the treatment in pure DME or DME\u2013CO 2 at various temperatures. After the treatment at 850 \u00b0C in pure DME, the weight increased approximately 29.2%. By comparison, the increase was 16.0% at 650 \u00b0C. Such weight gain is obviously from the coke formation over the anode. By introducing CO 2 into the fuel, the integrity of the cell was preserved much better. Less changes were observed in the anode geometry at higher operating temperatures. As shown in Table 3 , less weight gain was also observed at elevated temperature, in good agreement with the O 2 -TPO results. The presence of CO 2 effectively reduced the carbon deposition at elevated temperature, due to the reforming of DME or CH 4 by CO 2 or the elimination of deposited carbon by CO 2 . Fig. 9 (a, c and e) shows SEM photos of the Ni-YSZ anode fresh, after the treatment in pure DME, and in DME\u2013CO 2 under open circuit conditions at 850 \u00b0C for 30 min, respectively. No obvious difference between the fresh anode and the anode after the treatment in the mixture of DME\u2013CO 2 at 850 \u00b0C for 30 min was observed. However, extra particles, which are likely the solid carbon, were observed during SEM analysis of the sample treated in pure DME. To further determine the composition of particles, the three anodes (mentioned previously) were investigated by EDX at selected positions, as shown in Fig. 9 (b, d and f). We know that the samples for EDX examination were easily contaminated with carbon. Considering this effect, carbon information of the fresh anode was also obtained by EDX. As shown in Fig. 9 (b), a small carbon peak was found at positions 1 and 2 of Fig. 9 (a), and the average amount of carbon was 14.8 wt.%. For the sample after treatment in DME\u2013CO 2 at 850 \u00b0C, the intensity of the carbon peaks at positions 5 and 6 of Fig. 9 (e) were weak, and the average amount of carbon was 15.9 wt.%. These results indicate that there was minimal coke formation over the anode after treatment in DME\u2013CO 2 at 850 \u00b0C. On the contrary, carbon peaks of high intensity were detected at positions 3 and 4 of Fig. 9 (c) for the anode after treatment in pure DME at 850 \u00b0C. The above results agree well with the O 2 -TPO results and suggest the importance of the introduction of CO 2 at proper temperatures to suppress the coke formation when operating on DME fuel. 3.3 Cell performance Fig. 10 (a\u2013c) shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P polarization curves of the anode-supported fuel cell with a conventional Ni-YSZ anode operating on 3% water humidified hydrogen, pure DME and DME\u2013CO 2 at temperatures ranging from 850 to 650 \u00b0C. When 3% water humidified hydrogen was applied as the fuel, the peak power densities (PPDs) are 990, 739, 524, 291 and 162 mW cm \u22122 at 850, 800, 750, 700 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively; these values are 965, 786, 495, 340 and 187 mW cm \u22122 when operating on DME fuel. Similarly, by applying DME\u2013CO 2 as the fuel, the PPDs reached 811, 664, 548, 351 and 171 mW cm \u22122 at corresponding temperatures. The results indicate that the cell power outputs are comparable when operating on hydrogen, DME fuel or DME\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures. This outcome could be explained by the decomposition and CO 2 reforming of DME. As H 2 and CO are the main products of these reactions, similar power outputs can be obtained for the fuel cell operating on H 2 , DME or DME\u2013CO 2 . In this study, the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the fuel cell operating on H 2 was 1.08 V at 850 \u00b0C, which is close to the theoretical value. When applying DME as the fuel, the OCV of the fuel cell was 1.10 V at 850 \u00b0C. Meanwhile, we found that the OCV decreased with decreasing operating temperatures. This behavior could be related to the nature of DME fuel. The OCV of the fuel cell operating on DME\u2013CO 2 mixtures was 1.03 V, which was lower than pure DME. This result can be explained by the increased oxygen partial pressure in the anode chamber due to the introduction of CO 2 to pure DME. Good operational stability is significant for practical application of fuel cells. Tests to determine the cells\u2019 stabilities when operating on DME or DME\u2013CO 2 under a constant current density of 1000 mA cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C were performed. For comparison, the cell stability while operating on 3% water humidified hydrogen was also investigated under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 11 , when hydrogen was the fuel, the cell voltage remained stable at 0.77 V during the first 150 min, and slightly dropped to 0.73 V (a reduction of \u223c5.2%) after operation on H 2 for 300 min. By operating on pure DME fuel, the cell voltage obviously decreased with operating time, from an initial value of 0.72 V to only 0.65 V (a reduction of \u223c9.7%) after 300 min at 850 \u00b0C. The performance degradation can be explained by the coke formation over the anode, which covered the active sites. However, less cell degradation was demonstrated by operating on DME\u2013CO 2 . The initial value of the voltage was 0.67 V, which decreased slightly to 0.63 V (a reduction of \u223c5.9%) after an operational period of 300 min. Combined with the results from operating on hydrogen fuel, such degradation was unlikely due to the fuel. In other words, the cell can stably operate on DME\u2013CO 2 at 850 \u00b0C without coke formation. 4 Conclusions The conventional anode catalyst, Ni-YSZ, had good catalytic activity for the decomposition and CO 2 reforming of DME. When applying DEM as the fuel of SOFCs, the carbon deposition over the surface of the anode is a major concern, especially under open circuit condition. Obvious coke formation over the Ni-YSZ anode was detected in a pure DME atmosphere, and more carbon deposits were observed at higher operating temperatures. The carbon deposition can destroy the integrity of the fuel cell under OCV conditions and result in degradation of the cell's performance. Coke formation can be suppressed greatly by introducing CO 2 to the DME, especially at high temperatures. A fuel cell delivered similar power densities operating on 3% water-humidified hydrogen, pure DME and DME\u2013CO 2 , respectively. The performance of the fuel cell was stable when using DME\u2013CO 2 as the fuel under a constant current polarization at 850 \u00b0C for 300 min, while obvious degradation was noticed when operating on pure DME. Future work will focus on modifications to the anode that will enable operation with DME fuel.

        "abstract": "SSC (70 wt.% SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 )\u2013SDC (30 wt.% Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 ) composite was evaluated as cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. The effect of firing temperature on the chemical interaction between SSC and SDC was characterized by oxygen-temperature programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) techniques. Certain type of phase reactions occurred between SSC and SDC at calcination temperatures higher than 950 \u00b0C. The conductivity of the composite was measured by a four-prober direct current technique. The electro-catalytic activity of the composite electrode for oxygen reduction was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a symmetric cell configuration. The electrode fired at 950 \u00b0C showed the best performance. By applying the SSC + SDC-composite electrode, a cell with a \u223c20-\u03bcm thick SDC electrolyte delivered a peak power density of 760 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. This suggested that an SSC + SDC-composite electrode may be a promising cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Cathode Perovskite Composite electrode 1 Introduction It is generally believed that the successful reduction of the operating temperatures of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) from their traditionally high range near 1000 \u00b0C to the intermediate-to-low-temperature range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C will accelerate the commercialization of SOFC technology in the near future because this lower-temperature operation can provide several important benefits, including reduced material costs, prolonged cell lifetimes and more elegant sealing [1,2] . However, a major challenge associated with temperature reduction is the sharp increase in cathodic polarization resistance [3,4] . As a result, the power outputs of conventional SOFCs using yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathodes, and Ni\u2013YSZ cermet anodes are too low to have practical importance at operating temperatures lower than 600 \u00b0C. There have recently been considerable research efforts in developing novel cathode materials that can perform well in the intermediate-to-low-temperature range [5\u201312] . Among the various candidate cathode materials, mixed-conducting oxides have received particular interest [8\u201312] . Differing from the pure electronic conduction of LSM cathodes, where the oxygen-reduction reaction is strictly limited to the electrolyte\u2013electrode\u2013air triple-phase boundary (TPB), the oxygen-reduction reactions on mixed-conducting electrodes with high enough ionic conductivity can occur along the entire cathode surface. As a result, some mixed-conducting oxides still show high activity for oxygen reduction at temperatures down to 500 \u00b0C [13\u201315] . Among the various mixed-conducting cathodes, cobalt-based perovskites originating from the SrCoO x parent oxide have received considerable attention [16\u201324] . During the past several years, our group has made significant research efforts to develop novel cobalt-based perovskite-type oxide materials as cathodes in low-temperature SOFCs [20\u201324] . By the partial substitution of Co in SrCoO x with Sc 3+ , the cubic perovskite structure of the oxide was successfully stabilized at room temperature and the oxygen vacancies inside the lattice were also delocalized [21,22] . As a result, the oxides showed high ionic conductivity of oxygen and high electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction. In particular, SrSc 0.2 Co 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite (SSC) showed high activity for oxygen reduction at 450\u2013600 \u00b0C, owing to its high oxygen vacancy concentration. This oxide also demonstrated an almost linear thermal expansion from room temperature to around 1000 \u00b0C in air, with an average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of 16.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 [21] . A successful cathode for SOFCs should meet several requirements, such as sufficient electrical conductivity for efficient current collection, a suitable thermal expansion coefficient to match the electrolyte thermo-mechanically, good chemical compatibility with the electrolyte and high activity for oxygen reduction. Recently, the formation of composite electrodes has been extensively exploited, and this has proven to be an effective way of improving electrode performance [25\u201328] . For example, by introducing an ionic conducting phase, typically of the same material as the electrolyte, the electrode performance of (Sm,Sr)CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 can be improved significantly, especially at reduced temperatures [10] . This improvement is attributed to the creation of continuous ionic and electronic diffusion paths within the bulk electrode, which effectively extends the active zone for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen. Another significant advantage of the composite electrode is its better compatibility with the electrolyte, both thermo-mechanically and chemically. Previously, we investigated an Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 + Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SDC + BSCF) composite as potential for low-temperature SOFC electrode [23] . Although SDC is an ionic conductor with negligible electronic conductivity, the introduction of SDC to form a composite with BSCF considerably increased the apparent electrical conductivity of the composite oxide when it was fired at the proper temperature [29] . This improvement was due to the interfacial reaction between BSCF and SDC, which resulted in the incorporation of samarium and cerium from SDC into BSCF to form new phases with higher electrical conductivity than the parent BSCF oxide. For the purpose of making the SSC electrode more compatible with the SDC electrolyte, in this study the formation of a composite electrode with SSC and SDC was investigated. The phase reaction between SSC and SDC, the electrical conductivity and the electrode performance were investigated in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis and cell fabrication Both SSC and SDC powders were prepared by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate sol\u2013gel complexation process. Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7H 2 O, Sm(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O, Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O and Sc 2 O 3 were utilized as the metal sources. Sc 2 O 3 powder was prepared as an aqueous solution by dissolving it in a dilute nitric acid solution before using it in the sol\u2013gel synthesis. The synthesis of SSC, as an example, is as follows: stoichiometric amounts of Sc(NO 3 ) 3 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 and Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7H 2 O were first prepared as a mixed solution. An EDTA\u2013NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O solution and solid citric acid were then added sequentially under stirring and heating at a molar ratio of total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid of 1:1:2. NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O was used to adjust the pH value to around 6. With the evaporation of water from the solution under heating on a hotplate a clear gel was obtained, which was calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere to yield the target SSC powder. Electrolyte-supported symmetric cells were adopted for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The SDC electrolyte pellets (12 mm in diameter, 0.6 mm in thickness) were obtained by dry pressing the SDC powder under a hydraulic pressure of around 200 MPa using a 15-mm stainless-steel die followed by sintering the green disks at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The cathode slurry was prepared by ball-milling SSC and SDC powders in isopropyl alcohol at 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The resulting slurry was painted onto both surfaces of the SDC pellets symmetrically. The green pellets were then dried and fired at 950, 1000, 1050 or 1100 \u00b0C in air for 2 h to obtain the SSC + SDC|SDC|SSC + SDC symmetric cells. Anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cells were adopted for the I \u2013 V polarization test. The anode powder was prepared by mixing nickel oxide and SDC at a weight ratio of 3:2 using an agate mortar and pestle. The anode-supported thin-film SDC dual-layer cells were prepared by dual dry pressing followed by co-sintering at 1450 \u00b0C in air for 5 h. The cathode slurry was then painted onto the central surface of the sintered electrolyte and fired at 950 or 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to form the complete cells with an effective area of about 0.48 cm 2 for the porous cathode layer. 2.2 Basic characterization The electrical conductivities of SSC and the SSC + SDC composite were determined by a four-probe DC conductivity measurement from 900 to 300 \u00b0C at intervals of 10 \u00b0C. A constant DC current was created by a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter (USA) and the voltage response was recorded with the help of Labview software. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to a maximum value of 2 A, and only the data following the Ohmic law were applied for the calculation of the conductivity. At each temperature, 2 min was allowed for the conductivity to reach an equilibrium state. The reaction between SSC and SDC was investigated by ex-situ techniques. The SSC and SDC were mechanically mixed with the help of a high-energy ball miller employing zirconium oxide as the grinding ball and isopropyl alcohol as the solvent, and then calcined at 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C in air for 5 h, respectively. After the calcinations, the samples were cooled to room temperature and ground to powders in a mortar for O 2 -TPD (O 2 -temperature programmed desorption) tests. For a typical O 2 -TPD experiment, approximately 0.15 g of oxide powder (SSC or SSC + SDC) was placed in a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of about 3 mm. Pure argon at a flow rate of 15 mL min \u22121 (STP: standard temperature and pressure) was fed into the reactor. The reactor was heated from room temperature to 930 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The effluent gases from the reactor were monitored by a Hiden QIC-20 Mass Spectroscope (MS). The microstructures of the cells were examined by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). 2.3 Electrochemical characterization For the EIS test, silver paste was coated onto the electrode surfaces as the current collectors. Electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz\u2013100 kHz with an AC signal amplitude of 10 mV using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1260A frequency-response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. Z-view 3.0a software was used to analyze the obtained impedance spectra. The electrode performance was measured between the operating temperatures of 450\u2013700 \u00b0C and oxygen pressures ranging from 0.04 to 1.00 atm created by mixing O 2 and N 2 gas streams. 2.4 Single-cell test For a fuel cell performance test, the fuel cells were sealed onto quartz tube reactors with silver paste. The anode chamber was fed with pure hydrogen at a flow rate of 60 mL min \u22121 [STP], while the cathode was exposed to ambient air. The I \u2013 V polarization test was conducted using a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter with a four-probe configuration. The power density was calculated based on the geometric cathode active area, which was \u223c0.48 cm 2 in this study. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase reaction between SSC and SDC The solid-state reaction between electrode components in the composite electrode during cell operation could be a practical problem [30] . Although at the operating conditions of intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs, 500\u2013800 \u00b0C) such a reaction is less likely, it could occur during the cell fabrication process when firing the cathode layer onto the electrolyte membrane surface, which is usually performed at 950\u20131150 \u00b0C [31,32] . However, such a high-temperature firing process is necessary to create sufficient mechanical strength in the electrode layer, and it also allows the electrode to adhere firmly to the electrolyte surface. Previously, we investigated the phase reaction between SSC and SDC, between 800 and 1100 \u00b0C, by post-fabrication XRD examination [22] . No additional phases or shift of diffraction peaks were detected by XRD for the samples calcined at temperatures. It seems that there was no significant phase reaction between SSC and SDC even at 1100 \u00b0C. However, XRD may not be sensitive enough to probe the phase reaction in micro-domains. In this study the phase reaction between SSC and SDC was re-examined by O 2 -TPD. Equal amounts of SSC and SDC powder by weight were well mixed and subsequently sintered at various temperatures for 5 h, and the derived mixed powder was evaluated for phase composition. Previously, we demonstrated that O 2 -TPD was a useful technique to probe the phase reaction between BSCF and BaCe 0.9 Y 0.1 O 3 and also between BSCF and BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.8 Y 0.1 O 3 [33,34] . With a linear increase of operating temperature under an inert atmosphere, the cobalt ions can be thermally reduced to a lower oxidation state accompanied by the release of oxygen from the oxide lattice. The released oxygen can be detected by an on-line mass spectrometer. Typically, the oxygen released over the temperature zone of 300\u2013700 \u00b0C, here denoted as \u03b1 oxygen, is associated with the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ and/or adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the oxide (which is typically small as compared to lattice oxygen of mixed-conducting cobalt-contained oxides), while the oxygen released at T > 800 \u00b0C, \u03b2 oxygen, is related to the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ [33] . The phase reaction may lead to a change of the local environment around the cobalt ion in the perovskite, which can induce the corresponding change of the desorption peak area and the peak temperature in the O 2 -TPD profile. To get more insight into the possible phase reaction between SSC and SDC, the O 2 -TPD technique [35\u201338] was applied. Shown in Fig.\u00a01 are the O 2 -TPD profiles of the SSC + SDC composites calcined at various temperatures, and for comparison, the pure SSC oxide calcined at the same temperatures are also presented. It is well known that the surface and grain-boundary interfaces for many cathode materials are not necessarily the same phase as the bulk material. The \u03b1-oxygen desorption reflects the adsorption properties of the surface or near-surface of an oxide. The pure SSC powders calcined at different temperatures showed different \u03b1-oxygen desorption indicating that the different heating history influenced the surface properties of the SSC. However, we should also realize that the \u03b2-oxygen desorption peaks are almost the same for all the SSC samples tested. This suggests that the bulk properties of the SSC are negligibly influenced by heating history. After the formation of a composite with SDC, the \u03b1-oxygen peak of SSC shifted slightly\u00a0to the lower-temperature zone as compared to the single-phase SSC. This suggested that the formation of the composite likely facilitated the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ in SSC. Furthermore, the \u03b2-oxygen peak area of the composite oxide decreased with increasing calcination temperature and the\u00a0\u03b2-oxygen peak totally disappeared at calcination temperatures of 1050 \u00b0C and higher. As for the single-phase SSC, the \u03b2-oxygen peak is almost unchanged with calcination temperature. These results imply that a phase reaction or interaction between SSC and SDC indeed occurred at a calcination temperature of 950 \u00b0C, especially at 1100 \u00b0C. However, interestingly, no impurity phases are observed at any calcination temperatures by XRD. Therefore, it is likely that phase reaction occurred by the diffusion of Sm and Ce from SDC into the A- or B-lattice sites of SSC. It is well known that more than 90% of the metallic natural elements in the Periodic Table can be doped into the perovskite lattice [39] . It has been reported that both Sm and Ce can be doped into the A-site and B-site of perovskite [40\u201342] . Sm 2+ (1.24 \u00c5) and Ce 3+ (1.34 \u00c5) have smaller ionic radii than Sr 2+ (1.44 \u00c5) in the A-site, while Sm 3+ (0.958 \u00c5) and Ce 4+ (0.87 \u00c5) have larger ionic radii than the Sc 3+ (0.745 \u00c5) and Co 3+/4+ (0.61/0.53 \u00c5) in the B-site. Since there were almost no differences in the lattice parameters for the SSC oxide before and after the firing, it is likely that Sm and Ce doped simultaneously into the A-site and B-site of the SSC oxide lattice. This led to the very similar XRD patterns even after the formation of new phases. 3.2 Electrical conductivity Electron conduction in the perovskite oxide is via small-polaron hopping with a mechanism similar to the Zener double exchange [43] : B n + \u2013 O 2 \u2212 \u2013 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + \u2013 O \u2212 \u2013 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + \u2013 O 2 \u2212 \u2013 B n + The electron conductivity is closely related to the overlapping of the 3d orbital of Co with the 2p orbital of oxygen. The oxygen vacancy blocks the electron hopping between cobalt and oxygen ions, so a decrease in the electronic conductivity is expected with an increase of oxygen vacancy concentration. Similarly, Sc 3+ doping would also lead to a decrease in electronic conductivity because of its fixed valence state. In our previous investigation of the BSCF + SDC composite electrode, we observed a higher electronic conductivity of the composite than for pure BSCF because of the phase reaction between BSCF and SDC [23] . Such improvement can be explained in part by the fact that the doping of Ce 3+ and Sm 3+ into A-site of the BSCF resulted in the shrinking of the lattice. Because Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ have smaller ionic size than Ba 2+ /Sr 2+ , their doping in the A-site of the BSCF promotes the B-site metal ions to take a higher valence state. Consequently, the distance between the B-site metals became closer and thus it is easier for electron exchange between the B-site ions to occur. On the other hand, Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ have a higher valence state than Ba 2+ /Sr 2+ , and thus the doping of Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ into the A-site of the BSCF reduced the oxygen vacancy concentration, which is also beneficial for increasing the p-type conductivity. It is well known that SDC has a negligible electronic conductivity (<10 \u22121 S cm \u22121 ) as compared to SSC (30\u201340 S cm \u22121 ), suggesting that the formation of the SSC + SDC composite would result in a decrease of the apparent conductivity of the composite in the absence of a phase reaction between SSC and SDC. The electrical conductivity of the SSC + SDC composite sintered at different temperatures was then measured by the four-probe DC technique. The degree of phase reaction between SSC and SDC was closely related to the sintering temperature. Because it was impossible to obtain a dense-type composite at all sintering temperatures, the electrical conductivity was then corrected by the porosity as described by applying the empirical formula [44] : \u03c3 corrected = \u03c3 measured / ( 1 \u2212 ( p / 100 ) ) 2 with p = porosity ( in % ) . Table 1 lists the relative densities of the SSC + SDC sintered at various temperatures. For the calculation of the porosity, the absolute densities were assumed to remain unchanged with the phase reaction between SSC and SDC. The values were calculated using the Landauer\u2019s model [45] as follows: \u03c3 = 1 / 4 { ( 3 V 1 \u2212 1 ) \u03c3 1 + ( 3 V 2 \u2212 1 ) \u03c3 2 + [ { ( 3 V 1 \u2212 1 ) \u03c3 1 + ( 3 V 2 \u2212 1 ) \u03c3 2 } 2 + 8 \u03c3 1 \u03c3 2 ] 1 / 2 } where \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 are the electrical conductivities of the two phases, respectively, and V 1 and V 2 are their volume fractions. This is a reasonable assumption as there was almost no variation of the lattice parameter for both SSC and SDC phases with the sintering temperature. Shown in Fig.\u00a02 are the electrical conductivities of the SSC + SDC composite sintered at various temperatures corrected by the porosity, and for comparison is the electrical conductivity of pure SSC and the calculated conductivity of the SSC + SDC composite assuming no phase reaction between SSC and SDC. These data clearly show that the electrical conductivity of the composites increased with the sintering temperature. Furthermore, the measured values of conductivity for the composites calcined at all temperatures were higher than the calculated values for the composite without phase reaction implying that a phase reaction occurred between SSC and SDC indeed, which agrees well with the O 2 -TPD results. As mentioned previously, the phase reaction resulted in the incorporation of Sm and Ce into the perovskite lattice. Because Sm 3+ and Ce 4+ have higher valence states than Sr 2+ , the phase reaction would result in a decrease of the oxygen vacancy concentration, consequently facilitating electron hopping. A sufficient electrical conductivity is important for efficient current collection. In this aspect the phase reaction between SSC and SDC is beneficial for fuel cell applications. 3.3 Electrode performance The performance of the composite electrode for oxygen reduction was studied by EIS in symmetric cell tests. Fig.\u00a03 shows the temperature dependence of the electrode polarization resistances of the SSC + SDC electrodes calcined at various temperatures, for comparison, the electrode polarization resistances of pure SSC calcined at 950 and 1000 \u00b0C are also presented. Lower area-specific resistances (ASRs) were observed for the SSC electrode calcined at 1000 \u00b0C than that calcined at 950 \u00b0C, while the activation energies were similar for both electrodes, with values of \u223c111 kJ mol \u22121 . The improved performance of SSC by calcination at 1000 \u00b0C was attributed to a better connection between the SSC particles in the electrode and the better adhesion of the electrode to the electrolyte surface. However, for the SSC + SDC composite electrode a monotonic increase of the electrode polarization resistance with calcination temperature was observed. The performance of the composite electrode is worse than the pure SSC electrode, even for the SSC + SDC composite electrode fired at 950 \u00b0C. This suggests that the incorporation of SDC decreased the electrode activity of SSC for oxygen reduction. Electrode performance is closely related to the ionic and electronic conductivity of the electrode material. SDC has a negligible electronic conductivity compared to its oxygen-ionic conductivity. The formation of a composite electrode for SSC with SDC should then make the electron charge-transfer process more difficult as compared to the single-phase SSC electrode. The oxygen-ion charge-transfer process is much more complex because SSC also possesses oxygen-ionic conductivity. Owing to the mixed conductivity of SSC, it is difficult to directly measure its ionic conductivity. It was therefore roughly calculated based on the oxygen-permeation fluxes of the dense SSC membrane. Previously, we measured the oxygen-permeation fluxes of an SSC membrane under an air/helium oxygen gradient between 700 and 900 \u00b0C [46] . Assuming that bulk diffusion is controlling in the permeation process, the oxygen-ionic conductivity can be calculated based on the oxygen-permeation fluxes and the oxygen partial pressures at each side of the membranes. The oxygen partial pressure at the oxygen-rich side is constant at P O2 = 0.21 atm, while it varies at the oxygen-lean side, and it can be calculated based on the flux and helium-sweeping rate. The oxygen-ionic conductivity was calculated by the following equation: \u03c3 0 = D 0 C 0 q 0 2 k T where \u03c3 0 represents oxygen-ionic conductivity, D 0 is the self-diffusivity of the oxide ion, C 0 is the concentration of oxide ion, q 0 is the charge of the oxygen ion, k is the surface exchange coefficient, and T is the temperature [47] . For the conductivities of SDC, dense SDC pellets of 12 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness were prepared by dry pressing and then sintering in air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h. Silver paste was painted over both sides of the pellets as current collector before the EIS test. The intercept of the impedance plot at the high frequency with the real axis gave the Ohmic resistance ( R \u03a9 ) of the SDC pellet. And the conductivities of SDC were calculated using the equation as follows: \u03c3 0 = 1 R \u03a9 \u22c5 l S where l is the thickness and S is the area of the electrode. Shown in Fig.\u00a04 is the temperature dependence of the calculated ionic conductivity of SSC and also the conductivities of SDC measured in our lab, these indicate that SSC has a higher ionic conductivity than SDC. Therefore, the introduction of the SDC phase also resulted in the reduced ionic conductivity observed, and it then well explains the reduced electrode performance of SSC when in a composite with SDC. The increase of ASRs with calcination temperature could also be due in part to the decreased surface area. The calculated activation energy of the ASRs were 114, 114, 115 and 117 kJ mol \u22121 for the SSC + SDC electrodes calcined at 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C, respectively, as a comparison, it is 113 kJ mol \u22121 for the pure SSC electrode. The increase of activation energy suggests that the phase reaction between SDC and SSC leads to a slight but detectable change in the reaction mechanism over the composite electrode. Shown as Nyquist plots in Fig.\u00a05 a and b are the typical EIS of the symmetric cells with SSC + SDC composite electrode calcined at 950 \u00b0C. Similar to that of the pure SSC electrode [22] , the impedance spectra contain two separable depressed arcs, suggesting that at least two different electrode processes limited the oxygen-reduction reactions. To separate the two processes, the impedance spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit with a standardized configuration, as shown in Fig.\u00a05 c, similar to that previously adopted for the symmetric cell with the pure SSC electrode [22] . The overall Ohmic resistance of the cell, R \u03a9 , includes the electrolyte resistance, the electrode Ohmic resistance and the lead resistance. According to the literature the low-frequency arc is likely associated with the diffusion process, while the high-frequency arc is probably related to charge-transfer processes [48] . To further elucidate these two processes, the EIS of the SSC + SDC cathode is performed at 600 \u00b0C at various oxygen partial pressures, the results are shown in Fig.\u00a06 . As can be seen here, the value of the overall electrode resistance, R p , increased from 0.052 to 0.157 \u03a9 cm 2 as the oxygen partial pressure decreased from 1.0 to 0.04 atm. No additional arc was observed at the low-frequency range even at the oxygen partial pressure of 0.04 atm, which suggests the absence of gaseous diffusion polarization resistance. The corresponding separated R E1 and R E2 at various P O2 values are shown in Fig.\u00a07 as 1/ R E1 and 1/ R E2 plotted as functions of oxygen partial pressure. log 1/ R E1 has a log P O2 -dependent slope of 0.24 (\u223c1/4) at 600 \u00b0C, implying\u00a0that this process is likely to be related to the charge-transfer process. log 1/ R E2 had a log P O2 -dependent slope of 0.43 (\u223c1/2), indicating that this process is associated with the diffusion of oxygen species on the surface of the SSC + SDC electrode [49\u201353] , a similar observation has been reported for the pure SSC [22] . Shown in Fig.\u00a08 are the R E1 and R E2 for the SSC + SDC electrodes calcined at different temperatures, for comparison, those of the pure SSC calcined at 1000 \u00b0C are also presented. This figure clearly shows that the formation of composite electrode resulted in the increase of both R E1 and R E2 . Therefore, both the charge-transfer process and the surface process were somewhat hindered by the formation of the composite electrode. The worsening of the charge-transfer process of the SSC electrode by composite formation with SDC can be readily understood, as both the ionic conductivity and the electronic conductivity of SDC are lower than SSC. The increase in R E2 then suggests that SSC also had a higher surface activity than SDC. The increase in both R E1 and R E2 with calcination temperature is a sign of the detrimental effect of the phase reaction on both the ionic charge-transfer process and the surface process. Because the electronic conductivity was improved with calcination temperature, it suggests that the ionic charge-transfer process was the main contributor to the charge-transfer polarization resistance. We have demonstrated previously that the incorporation of Sm 3+ and Ce 4+ into the SSC lattice reduced the oxygen vacancy concentration, which may reduce the oxygen-ionic conductivity of the oxide. However, it is well known that oxygen diffusion and adsorption on the electrode surface is also closely related to the oxygen vacancy concentration. Surface oxygen vacancies would facilitate the adsorption and diffusion of oxygen. The above results suggest that a lower calcination temperature is beneficial for obtaining a better electrode performance. 3.4 Single-cell performance To demonstrate the performance of the SSC + SDC composite electrode under real fuel cell conditions, complete cells were fabricated. Shown in Fig.\u00a09 are SEM images of cross-sectional views of two complete cells with the SSC + SDC electrodes calcined at 950 and 1000 \u00b0C. The SSC + SDC composite electrodes calcined at 950 \u00b0C was much more porous than that calcined at 1000 \u00b0C. Shown in Fig.\u00a010 are the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the cells with SSC + SDC electrodes calcined at various temperatures. For all cells the electrolyte thickness was controlled at around 20 \u03bcm. A peak power density (PPD) of \u223c760 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C, which is only slightly lower than that of the pure SSC electrode (\u223c1000 mW cm \u22122 , Ref.\u00a0 [21] ). Therefore, the SSC + SDC composite is still a promising electrode material for IT-SOFCs. With the increase of calcination temperature the cell performance decreased monotonically to \u223c600 mW cm \u22122 for the cell with the SSC + SDC electrode fired at 1000 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig.\u00a09 , the porosity of the cathode sintered at 1000 \u00b0C is lower than that sintered at 950 \u00b0C, which would result in the concentration polarization of the cathode, especially at the high current density. Therefore a dramatic drop in voltages at the high current density for the cell based on 1000 \u00b0C calcined SSC + SDC cathode was observed, indicating that the oxygen diffusion resistivity increased due to the decreased porosity of the cathode. The reduced cell performance can also be attributed to the increased phase reaction between the electrode components, which led to the further reduced oxygen vacancies. Although the electrode performance was somewhat reduced by the formation of composite with SDC, the electrode thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was also reduced for the composite cathode, which made the electrode more thermo-mechanically compatible with the SDC electrolyte [29] . In the view of the long-term stability of the SOFCs, the SSC + SDC composite cathode is still a promising cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. 4 Conclusions SSC and SDC underwent a phase reaction between 950 and 1100 \u00b0C, detected by O 2 -TPD characterization. The phase reaction likely occurred by the incorporation of cerium and samarium from SDC into both the A-site and B-site of SSC. The phase reaction increased the reducibility of the cobalt ions. The newly formed phase had a higher electrical conductivity than the calculated values for the composite of the reactants, SSC and SDC, without phase reaction. The derived electrical conductivity of the composite was only slightly lower than that of SSC. Due to lower ionic conductivity and electronic conductivity of SDC as compared to SSC, a lower electrode performance was observed for the SSC + SDC composite than for the pure SSC electrode. The increase in firing temperature resulted in a lower electrode surface area and in a higher degree of the phase reaction between SSC and SDC. As a result, the SSC + SDC electrode fired at 950 \u00b0C showed the best performance. A cell with an SSC + SDC electrode fired at 950 \u00b0C and a thin-film SDC electrolyte (20 \u03bcm) delivered a PPD of 760 mW cm \u22122 . Suppressing the phase reaction between SSC and SDC will be the key to improving the electrode performance of this composite electrode.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a doubt about the electrochemical contribution of silver current collector on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) over oxide electrodes in SOFCs since many reports have demonstrated that the modification of porous oxide electrodes with nano-size silver can obviously improve the electrocatalytic activity for ORR. In this study, the electrochemical contribution of silver current collector to the performance of Ba 0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O 3-\u03b4 (BSCF) electrode on Sm0.2Ce0.8O 1.9 (SDC) electrolyte for ORR was specifically investigated. The active layer of BSCF electrode was found to be around 25 \u03bcm by using both silver and gold current collectors. Much better performance was demonstrated by using silver current collector, both from symmetric cell and single cell tests. However, EIS of silver on SDC electrolyte demonstrated the silver alone as electrode actually had poor performance for ORR. In addition, SEM-EDX confirmed that there was no silver diffused from the current collector layer to modify the porous BSCF electrode. Interestingly, the activation energy for oxygen reduction over BSCF electrode was reduced by applying silver current collector. We then proposed a mechanism to explain the improved electrochemical performance of BSCF electrode by considering the high activity of silver for oxygen surface diffusion. \u00a9 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Pure phase cubic perovskite was formed at y \u2265 0.83. The oxygen nonstoichiometry increased while electrical conductivity and permeability decreased with the decrease of y. However, the (BS)(CF)0.97 membrane still displayed an attractive oxygen flux as high as 2.4 \u00d7 10-6 mol cm-2 s-1 at 900 \u00b0C, as compared to 2.5 \u00d7 10-6 mol cm-2 s-1 for a cation stoichiometric BSCF membrane. The B-site deficiency greatly restrained the A-site cation diffusion and stabilized the perovskite structure and permeation properties of the membranes. During the long-term operation of the (BS)(CF)0.97 membrane at 850 \u00b0C for more than 300 h, a stable permeation flux of (1.8 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10-6 mol cm-2 s-1 was achieved. Further investigation demonstrated that the improved importance of oxygen bulk-diffusion regime in the rate-determination of oxygen permeation through the membranes. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Catalytic test demonstrated the nickel catalyst had higher catalytic activity than the severe sintered nickel\u2013cermet anode between 700 and 900 \u00b0C, especially at the lower temperature range. SEM examination demonstrated the nickel catalyst impregnation increased the roughness of the nickel grains within the anode. Furthermore, some surfaces of the ScSZ grains are also covered with very fine nickel catalyst. By operating on a methane-air mixture gas with methane to oxygen ratio of 1.3:1, the cell with its anode impregnated with the nickel catalyst showed an open circuit voltage and peak power density of 0.954 V and 119 mW cm \u22122 at a furnace temperature of 750 \u00b0C, respectively, as a comparison of 0.893 V and 79 mW cm \u22122 for the cell without the nickel catalyst. The improved cell performance was attributed to the higher cell temperature and increased anode catalytic activity for methane partial oxidation.",

        "abstract": "Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) perovskite was synthesized by the sol\u2013gel process based on EDTA\u2013citrate (EC) complexing method, nitric acid modified EC route (NEC) and nitric acid aided EDTA\u2013citrate combustion process (NECC). A crystallite size of 27, 38 and 42 nm, respectively, was observed for the powders of NECC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF and EC-BSCF calcined at 1000 \u00b0C, suggesting the suppression effect of nitric acid on the crystallite size growth of BSCF. The smaller crystallite size of the powders resulted in the higher degree of sintering of the cathode. Oxygen permeation study of the corresponding membranes demonstrated that in the powder synthesis, nitric acid also had a noticeable detrimental effect on the oxygen surface exchange kinetics and on the oxygen bulk diffusion rate of the BSCF oxides. The effect of powder synthesis route on the bulk properties of the oxide was validated by the oxygen temperature-programmed desorption technique. On the whole, a decreasing cathode performance in the sequence of EC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF was observed. A peak power density of 693 mW cm \u22122 was achieved for an anode-supported cell with an EC-BSCF cathode at 600 \u00b0C, which was significantly higher than that with an NEC-BSCF cathode (571 mW cm \u22122 ) or an NECC-BSCF cathode (543 mW cm \u22122 ) under similar operation conditions. Keywords Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Synthesis Solid-oxide fuel cell Perovskite Electrical conductivity 1 Introduction Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a promising power generation technology characterized by high energy conversion efficiency and low pollutant emission. Traditional SOFCs are based on thick YSZ electrolyte membrane and operate at typically 1000 \u00b0C [1,2] . However, such high operating temperatures may result in a fast degradation of fuel cell performance due to the increased phase reaction between cell components and the easy sintering of the electrode. Therefore, it is a general trend for SOFCs to operate at reduced temperatures (<800 \u00b0C) [3\u20139] . Unfortunately the reduction of oxygen is a process requiring high activation energy, so that the decrease in operating temperature leads to a sharp increase in cathode polarization resistance of the traditional La 1\u2212 x Sr x MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathodes. The improvement of cathode performance is therefore critical for SOFC technology at reduced temperatures. Considerable efforts have been devoted to decrease the cathode polarization at reduced temperatures [10\u201320] . One strategy is to develop new cathode materials with mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity [10\u201316] . Such materials extend the oxygen reduction site from the traditional triple-phase boundary (cathode\u2013electrolyte\u2013gas phase) to the entire cathode\u2013gas phase interface; therefore, a substantial increase in the cathode performance at reduced temperatures could be observed. On the other hand, cathode performance was also found closely related to the cathode architecture. The development of novel fabrication techniques that can promote gas diffusion and maximize the cathode area for oxygen reduction has also received great attention [17\u201320] . The cathode layer in SOFCs is usually fabricated with pre-crystallized powders by any of the methods including spray deposition, screen-printing or painting techniques, followed by high temperature sintering. Many powder synthesis methods have been applied to the synthesis of cathode materials, such as solid-state reaction, sol\u2013gel, co-precipitation, hydrothermal synthesis, etc. [21\u201325] . Many researches have shown that synthesis methods may affect the morphology, conductivity, crystallite size and surface microstructure of the derived powders [26\u201330] . Such distinctions could have an evident influence on their properties in applications such as separation membrane and cathode for SOFCs. Indeed, it has been reported that powder synthesis methods had significant effects on the oxygen permeability of ceramic membranes based on mixed-conducting perovskite [28,30\u201332] . Establishing the relationship between the powder synthesis route and the cathode properties is therefore important for the improvement of the cathode performance. However, systematic reports about the effect of powder synthesis technique on cathode performance of SOFCs [29] are very rare. Shao et al. first reported Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) mixed-conducting perovskite oxide as a potential cathode for intermediate temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) [33] . The application of this material in IT-SOFCs has since received considerable attention [34\u201340] . In this study, the BSCF perovskite was selected for the demonstration of the significant effect of powder synthesis route on cathode performance. In our previous study, we found that the combined EDTA\u2013citrate (EC) complexing method was effective to synthesize nano-crystalline composite oxides [41] . The addition of nitric acid during the EC complexing process could improve the catalytic activity of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 composite oxide [42] and depress the crystallite size of the BSCF composite oxide [43] . Therefore, the nitric acid modified EDTA\u2013citrate (NEC) route and the nitric acid aided EDTA\u2013citrate combustion (NECC) process were selected to compare with the EC complexing method. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of BSCF powders All the three synthesis routes started from the same EDTA\u2013citrate\u2013metal precursor with a preparation procedure similar to our previous reports [41] . Appropriate amounts of metal nitrates were dissolved in water to make a mixed solution followed by the addition of EDTA and citric acid, which served as the complexing agents. Mild heating induced the gelation of the solution. The gels thus obtained were pre-heated at 250 \u00b0C for 5 h to form solid precursors. For the combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing method, the solid precursor was directly calcined in stagnant air at 1000 \u00b0C or 5 h. As for the nitric acid modified EDTA\u2013citrate and the nitric acid modified EDTA\u2013citrate combustion routes, for preparing 0.01 mol BSCF, an amount of 10 ml (NEC) or 30 ml (NECC) concentrated nitric acid (67 wt.%) was dropped into the solid precursor to form a sticky gel, which was then re-heated at 250 \u00b0C for 5 h. After the heat treatment, the sample in the 10 ml case converted to a solid precursor, while the one in the 30 ml case resulted in an auto-combustion. Both precursors were then calcined in stagnant air at high temperatures for 5 h to obtain the final products. 2.2 Cell fabrication Symmetrical cells with the configuration of electrode|SDC|electrode were used for the impedance studies. Dense SDC pellets of 12 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm in thickness were prepared by dry pressing and sintered in air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h. BSCF powders were first dispersed in a mixed solution of glycerol, ethyleneglycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension by milling with the help of an agate mortar and pestle. The obtained slurries were painted symmetrically on both surfaces of the SDC pellets, followed by calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in stagnant air. Silver paste was painted onto the electrode surfaces as current collector. Anode-supported cells with SDC electrolyte were prepared using a co-pressing technique. Anode powders consisting of 60 wt.% NiO and 40 wt.% SDC were prepared by mixing NiO and SDC in an agate mortar. To fabricate the single cell, the well-mixed NiO\u2013SDC powder was firstly pressed as a substrate, onto which the SDC powder was added and pressed again to form a bilayer pellet. The pellet was then sintered in stagnant air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h for the densification of the electrolyte layer; the BSCF slurry was painted onto the central surface of the electrolyte and fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. The resulting coin-shaped cathode had a thickness of 20 \u03bcm and an effective area of 0.52 cm 2 . 2.3 Characterization I\u2013V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-probe configuration. Humidified H 2 (3% H 2 O) at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP] was fed into the anode chamber as fuel and compressed air was fed into the cathode chamber as oxidant. Gas flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers. Silver paste was adopted as current collector. The electrode performance was investigated with a symmetrical cell or complete cell configuration by the ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation Solartron 1287 potentiostat and a 1260 A frequency response analyzer. The test was conducted under open circuit voltage (OCV) condition with the frequency ranging from 0.01 to 100 kHz and a signal amplitude of 10 mV. The overall impedance data was fitted by a complex non-linear least square (CNLS) fitting program Z-View 2.9b. The crystal structure of the synthesized powders was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning within the range of 20\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 80\u00b0. The crystallite size was calculated based on the Scherrer equation from the study of Bragg angle and half bandwidth at the index peak of the (1 1 0) plane for BSCF. The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, LEO1530) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) attachment, or an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). Four-probe dc electrical conductivity of the oxide was measured over the bar-shaped BSCF samples sintered at 1000 \u00b0C in air with silver applied as the electrodes. The current and the voltage were detected by the Keithley 2420 source meter at an interval of 10 \u00b0C in the temperature range of 300\u2013900 \u00b0C. Oxygen desorption properties of the powders were studied by the oxygen temperature-programmed desorption technique (O 2 -TPD). About 150 mg of BSCF powder was loaded in a quartz tube. The assembly was placed in a single-zone furnace equipped with a temperature controller. Argon was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The temperature was increased from 200 to 1000 \u00b0C at the rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 and the effluent gases were monitored by the mass spectrometer (Hiden, QIC-20). The oxygen permeation flux measurements were performed using the gas chromatography (GC) method. Single dense membranes or porous BSCF layer modified membranes were sealed onto the quartz support tubes with silver paste. The sidewall of the membrane disks was also covered with the sealant to avoid radial contribution to the oxygen flux due to electrochemical leakage. Helium was used as the sweep gas at a flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 . A gas chromatograph (Varian, CP 3800) was used to analyze the outlet gas. The oxygen permeation flux was calculated by J O 2 \u2009 ( ml \u2009 c m \u2212 2 \u2009 mi n \u2212 1 , \u2009\u200a\u200a [ STP ] ) = C O \u2212 C N \u00d7 0.21 0.79 ( 28 / 32 ) 1 / 2 \u00d7 F S where C O and C N are the measured concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen in the gas on the oxygen-lean side (ml ml \u22121 ), respectively; F is the flow rate of the exit gas on the oxygen-lean side (ml min \u22121 ), and S is the membrane geometric surface area of the sweep side (cm 2 ). 3 Results and discussion The synthesis route was found to have a significant effect on the formation of BSCF perovskite. Among the three synthesis routes, the EC method was found to be the most efficient one for preparing pure-phase nano-crystalline BSCF oxide. A pure-phase BSCF was obtained at a firing temperature as low as 850 \u00b0C for the EC method, while the temperature had to be as high as 1000 \u00b0C for the NEC and NECC methods. The EC method is characterized by the homogeneous mixing of metal ions on the molecular level; it eliminates the blockage of solid-state diffusion for the formation of BSCF oxide and therefore ensures a low temperature synthesis [41] . As shown in Fig. 1 , the solid precursor from the EC method took on an amorphous structure even after being heated at 250 \u00b0C for 5 h, which implies that the metal ions were still homogeneously distributed in the organic matrix. However, strong characteristic diffraction peaks for Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 (NO 3 ) 2 appeared in the NEC derived solid precursor, which indicated the destruction of the complex. This agrees well with the fact that the conditional stability constants of Ba and Sr with EDTA at a pH value of <4 are both less than zero, i.e., EDTA was not able to immobilize Ba 2+ and Sr 2+ anymore under the nitric acid condition. When more nitric acid was applied, i.e., 30 ml HNO 3 applied to the solid precursor for preparing 0.01 mol BSCF powder, a vigorous self-combustion happened. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of the BSCF powders prepared by the three different methods after calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h. All the samples displayed phase-pure cubic perovskite structure. However, a decrease in the crystallinity was observed with the increase of nitric acid applied during the synthesis. The calculated crystallite size and lattice constant of the corresponding BSCF powders are listed in Table 1 . Obviously, the crystallite size of BSCF was depressed in the presence of nitric acid during the synthesis [43] . However, the lattice constant of BSCF oxide increased with the amount of nitric acid applied during the synthesis, which suggests that the average valences of cobalt and/or iron ions in BSCF were lowered after the nitric acid treatment of the solid precursor. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of various as-synthesized BSCF powders calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h. The powders obtained by the NEC and NECC methods mostly had a conic shape with the grain size varying from several microns to tens of microns. However, the powder prepared by the EC method took on a spherical shape. The relative amount of conic BSCF in the powder increased with the increasing amount of nitric acid applied in the synthesis. The conic particle was actually composed of smaller spherical particles sized 20\u201340 nm ( Fig. 3 C), which was comparable to the values reported in other references [44,45] . Subramania et al synthesized nano-crystalline BSCF powders at a temperature as low as 450 \u00b0C by a novel sol\u2013gel thermolysis method and the crystallite size of the BSCF provskite oxide was only 34 nm [44] . It should be noted that the temperature for cathode firing process can reach as high as 1000 \u00b0C while the BSCF oxide could be easily sintered due to the high surface energy at such a temperature. Therefore, it is more important to prepare nano-crystalline BSCF oxide at higher temperatures in practical use. The sintering behavior of the various BSCF powders was investigated. Bar-shaped BSCF samples were sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h, and the porosity and shrinkage of samples are shown in Table 2 . The relative density of the samples was found to be in the order of EC-BSCF < NEC-BSCF < NECC-BSCF, coinciding with the decreasing crystallite size of the starting powders. Since smaller crystallite size means higher surface energy, higher sintering of ceramics was observed [43] . The effect of the powder preparation method on the electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe dc method. Fig. 4 A shows the temperature dependence of the adjusted conductivity considering the porosity of various BSCF samples measured within the temperature range of 300\u2013900 \u00b0C in air. It shows that the electrical conductivity of all samples first increases linearly with temperature to around 450 \u00b0C, and then decreases, which can be attributed to the loss of lattice oxygen and the formation of oxygen vacancies at high temperatures (>450 \u00b0C). The electrical conductivity increased slightly with the increased amount of nitric acid applied during the synthesis, which might be related to the enhanced contact between neighboring particles. The electron conducting mechanism below 450 \u00b0C can be attributed to the hopping of p-type small polarons, which are associated with the behavior of triple and tetravalent state of cobalt and iron cations. The charge transfer is thermally activated and its temperature dependence is given by the following equation: \u03c3 = A T \u2009 exp \u2212 E a k T where A is a material constant containing the carrier concentration term, T the absolute temperature, E a the activation energy for small polaron hopping and k is the Boltzmann constant. Plots of log( \u03c3T ) versus 1/ T are constructed for the temperature range, as shown in Fig. 4 B. These plots are linear, and from their slopes the apparent activation energies are calculated. Although the apparent activation energy (300\u2013450 \u00b0C) for the three samples is very similar, there are still some slight differences, which is a reflection of the small difference in valences of cobalt and iron ions. The slightly high amount of tetravalent cations within B site is beneficial for the charge transfer. The apparent activation energy is the lowest for EC-BSCF, which may indicate that the amount of Co 4+ and/or Fe 4+ in EC-BSCF was higher than those in NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF. Since Co 4+ /Fe 4+ has a smaller ionic radius than Co 3+ /Fe 3+ , a smaller lattice constant of EC-BSCF than NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF should be observed, which coincides with the XRD results. The BSCF powders were then fabricated onto the electrolyte surface as the cathode layer by a painting method followed by calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h in air, with the corresponding SEM photos of the cathode layer shown in Fig. 5 . All the three samples show similar porous surface morphology. It is interesting that the conic-shaped particles of BSCF with the powders prepared by the NEC and NECC methods totally disappeared in the cathode layer after the fabrication and calcination. An increased degree of sintering for the cathode layer in the order of EC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF was also observed, coinciding with the fact that the crystallite size of the starting powders decreased in the reverse direction. Smaller crystallite size means a higher surface energy and therefore a higher sinterability. For cathodes based on mixed-conducting oxides, their performance is closely related to the effective surface area, the surface exchange kinetics and also the oxygen bulk diffusion rate of the cathode. The increased degree of sintering would have a detrimental effect on the cathode performance. The cathode performance of the BSCF oxides prepared by the three different methods was first tested by impedance spectroscopy, and symmetric cells composing of SDC electrolyte and BSCF electrodes were built for this purpose. Fig. 6 shows the temperature dependence of the area-specific resistances (ASRs) under the OCV condition. The EC-BSCF cathode shows both the lowest electrode resistance and activation energy. An ASR of 0.10 \u03a9 cm 2 for the EC-BSCF cathode was observed at 600 \u00b0C, while it was 0.36 \u03a9 cm 2 for the NECC-BSCF cathode. The activation energy for EC-BSCF is only 104 kJ mol \u22121 , while it is 117 kJ mol \u22121 for NECC-BSCF. All the above results strongly suggest that the powder preparation method has a significant effect on the cathode performance, the reason for which, according to Fig. 5 , could be due to the difference in the effective surface area of the cathodes prepared by different synthesis techniques. The increased degree of sintering with the increased amount of nitric acid applied during the synthesis resulted in the decreasing effective cathode area for oxygen reduction, which should account for the observed decrease in cathode performance. The performance of the mixed-conducting cathode is closely related not only to its effective surface area, but also to its oxygen surface exchange kinetics and bulk diffusion rate. The effect of the powder preparation method on the oxygen surface exchange and bulk diffusion properties was then quantitatively studied by the oxygen permeation method of dense ceramic membranes. Oxygen permeation through a dense mixed-conducting membrane is usually determined by oxygen surface exchange kinetics combined with oxygen bulk diffusion rate. Under the driving force of the oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane, an oxygen molecule first adsorbs over the membrane surface on the oxygen-rich side, where it dissociates into oxygen ions and generates electron holes, both of which then migrate through the bulk of the membrane to the other side of the membrane surface, where they recombine into an oxygen molecule; the molecular oxygen over the membrane surface finally desorbs and evolves into the oxygen-lean side atmosphere. Based on the oxygen permeation fluxes at various conditions, the information of oxygen surface exchange kinetics and bulk diffusion rate can be obtained. For the oxygen permeation study, BSCF powders were fabricated into dense ceramic membranes, and the permeation properties were characterized by the GC method. Shown in Fig. 7 is the temperature dependence of oxygen permeation flux through 1.0 mm thick BSCF membranes at a constant helium sweep rate of 100 ml min \u22121 with air being the feed gas. The permeation fluxes were found in the order of EC-BSCF > NEC-BSCF > NECC-BSCF. An increase of the activation energy for oxygen permeation in the sequence of EC-BSCF < NEC-BSCF < NECC-BSCF was also observed. We have shown in a previous paper that the oxygen permeation through surface-unmodified BSCF membrane was mainly rate-determined by the slow oxygen surface exchange kinetics at the oxygen-lean side membrane surface under an air/helium oxygen gradient [46] . It therefore suggests that the increase of nitric acid applied in the powder synthesis led to the decrease of oxygen surface exchange rate of the corresponding cathode. The effect of the powder preparation method on the oxygen bulk diffusion rate of the cathode was also investigated by the oxygen permeation study of the corresponding surface-modified BSCF membranes. A porous layer of BSCF was deposited onto the surface of BSCF membranes exposed to the oxygen-lean side atmosphere. The porous layer resulted in a significant improvement of the effective surface area for oxygen surface exchange; therefore, the importance of oxygen bulk diffusion in the rate determination of the oxygen permeation flux was enhanced. The oxygen permeation fluxes of the surface-modified membranes could then reflect the oxygen bulk diffusion rate. After the surface modification, as shown in Fig. 8 , the oxygen permeation flux increased most significantly for the BSCF membrane with the powder prepared by the EC method, followed by the membrane made of NEC-BSCF, while the improvement of the permeation flux of the membrane by NECC-BSCF was the smallest. It suggests that the synthesis techniques also have a significant influence on the bulk oxygen diffusion of the cathode materials. The higher amount of nitric acid applied during the synthesis, the lower oxygen bulk diffusion rate was observed. The influence of the preparation method on the bulk properties of the BSCF cathode was also supported by the O 2 -TPD experiments. Fig. 9 shows the oxygen temperature-programmed desorption curves of EC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF. A significant difference in oxygen desorption behavior at a temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C was observed. The oxygen desorption at such a temperature in O 2 -TPD profile was associated with the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ [47] . The difference in the shape of O 2 -TPD profiles for the various BSCF powders suggests that the preparation method has an effect on the cobalt valence state at high temperatures. Since the oxygen bulk diffusion rate is closely related to the oxygen vacancy concentration, which in turn is closely related to the valence state of metal ions in the perovskite structure, a difference in the oxygen bulk diffusion behavior of the various BSCF oxides can be anticipated. Complete fuel cells were built based on the thin-film SDC electrolyte and the EC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF or NECC-BSCF cathode. Fig. 10 shows the performances of the single cells using 3% water-humidified H 2 as the fuel and ambient air as the cathode atmosphere, operated at 550\u2013650 \u00b0C. Peak power densities of 693 and 825 mW cm \u22122 were achieved for the cell with the EC-BSCF cathode at operating temperatures of 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. As expected, worse performances were observed for the cells based on the other two cathodes. The peak power densities were only 571 and 543 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C for cells based on NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF cathodes, respectively. Shown in Fig. 11 are the typical impedance spectra for the cells with the EC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF cathodes measured at 600 \u00b0C under open circuit condition. Here, the intercept with the real axis at high frequencies represents the resistance of the electrolyte and lead wires (about 0.27 \u03a9 cm 2 ), whereas the resistance between the two intercepts with the real axis corresponds to the impedance of the two interfaces, i.e. the cathode\u2013electrolyte interface and the anode\u2013electrolyte interface. The electrode ASRs for the cells based on EC-BSCF, NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF cathode are 0.067, 0.097 and 0.207 \u03a9 cm 2 , respectively. Since the anodes are identical, the differences in the electrode ASRs can be essentially attributed to the cathode. Therefore, it is clear that the interfacial polarization resistance of EC-BSCF cathode was the lowest, which was about 0.03 and 0.14 \u03a9 cm 2 lower than that of NEC-BSCF and NECC-BSCF, respectively. 4 Conclusions Synthesis technique has a significant effect on the cathode performance of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite for solid-oxide fuel cells. The nitric acid treatment during the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process affects not only the sintering behavior of the cathode during fabrication, but also the oxygen surface exchange kinetics and the oxygen bulk diffusion properties of the cathode. Among the three synthesis methods including the combined EDTA\u2013citrate (EC) complexing method, the nitric acid modified EDTA\u2013citrate (NEC) route and the nitric acid modified EDTA\u2013citrate combustion (NECC) process, the EC method was found to be the most promising one for fuel cell applications. The increase of nitric acid applied during the powder synthesis led to the decrease of the crystallite size of the powder, the increase of sintering during fabrication, and the reduced surface oxygen exchange kinetics and bulk diffusion rate of the cathode. Consequently, the addition of HNO 3 during the synthesis process had a detrimental effect on the performance of fuel cell with the BSCF cathode. Therefore, for advances of IT-SOFCs, besides the development of new cathode materials and the optimization of the cathode architecture, proper powder synthesis techniques of the cathode material is also critical.

        "abstract": "As candidates of cathode materials for single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3 (LSSM) were synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. The solid precursors of LSM and LSSM were calcined at 1000 and 1150 \u00b0C, respectively, to obtain products with similar specific surface area. LSSM was found to have higher activity for methane oxidization than LSM due to LSSM's higher catalytic activity for oxygen reduction. Single cells with these two cathodes initialized by ex situ reduction had similar peak power densities of around 220 mW cm \u22122 at 825 \u00b0C. The cell using the LSM cathode showed higher open-circuit-voltage (OCV) at corresponding temperatures due to its reduced activity for methane oxidation relative to LSSM. A negligible effect of methane and CO 2 on the cathode performance was observed for both LSM and LSSM via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. The high phase stability of LSSM under reducing atmosphere allows a more convenient in situ reduction for fuel cell initiation. The resultant cell with LSSM cathode delivered a peak power density of \u223c200 mW cm \u22122 at 825 \u00b0C, comparable to that from ex situ reduction. Keywords Single chamber Solid oxide fuel cells Cathode Methane Initialization 1 Introduction In recent years, single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells (SC-SOFCs) have been receiving attention for their simplified reactor configuration and capability for quick start-up. They have potential application as micropower generator for portable devices. Because they operate on fuel\u2013air mixture, one way to minimize the gas phase reaction that would reduce the electrical efficiency is to adopt fuels with high chemical stability such as hydrocarbons with low carbon numbers, especially methane [1\u20137] ; another way is to reduce the operation temperature. The operation principle of methane-fueled SC-SOFCs relies on different chemical catalytic and electro-catalytic activities of anode and cathode materials in the methane\u2013air mixture [8\u201310] . Ideally, the cathode is inert to the oxidation of methane but highly efficient for oxygen reduction (Eq. (1) ), while the anode possesses high catalytic activity and selectivity towards partial oxidation of methane, forming CO and H 2 (Eq. (2) ). During operation, the oxygen anion is pumped from the cathode side through electrolyte and reacted with CO and H 2 at the anode to produce electricity (Eqs. (3) and (4) ). (1) 0.5O 2 + 2e \u2212 \u2192 O 2\u2212 (2) 2CH 4 + O 2 \u2192 2CO + 4H 2 (3) CO + O 2\u2212 \u2192 CO 2 + 2e \u2212 (4) H 2 + O 2\u2212 \u2192 H 2 O + 2e \u2212 Because of their large number of bulk oxygen vacancies, cobalt-based perovskite oxides like La 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSC), La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF), Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF), have been extensively investigated as cathode materials in dual-chamber SOFCs (DC-SOFCs) [11\u201315] . Good performance at intermediate temperature has been achieved in many reports. However, such materials are intrinsically unstable in reducing atmosphere. For example, BSCF can be reduced to metallic Co, Fe and BaO/Ba(OH) 2 \u00b7 x H 2 O, SrO/(Sr(OH) 2 \u00b7 x H 2 O under hydrogen atmosphere [16] . If these materials are applied as the cathode of SC-SOFCs, an additional ex situ reduction step is preferred to avoid destruction of the perovskite lattice structure by the reducing atmosphere during the initialization process [17\u201319] . The so-called ex situ reduction is a pre-reducing process for the anode substrate, mostly from NiO to Ni, before the deposition of cathode on the electrolyte layer. When applying the ex situ reduction process, to avoid the re-oxidation of the Ni-based anode, after the cathode deposition is completed, the three layered cell must be fired under an inert atmosphere to adhere the cathode onto the electrolyte surface firmly. However, such a SC-SOFC fabrication process is time consuming and expensive. In our previous work, a simplified in situ reduction process was introduced to initialize SC-SOFCs, in which both the unreduced anode and cathode were exposed to the same reducing atmosphere of hydrogen [20] . If successful, the conventional fuel cell fabrication technique could also be applied for the SC-SOFCs, thereby greatly reducing the fabrication cost. However, the initiation by in situ reduction did not work well for SC-SOFCs with a BSCF cathode. Although a reduced BSCF cathode can be partially restored to its initial perovskite structure under a methane\u2013air atmosphere at high temperatures, the power output of the cells was much lower than that of the cell initialized by ex situ reduction due to the altered electrode structure after the reduction/re-oxidation process. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a more stable cathode for the reducing atmosphere. As a classic cathode material of DC-SOFCs, La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) shows good structural and chemical stability under cathodic operation condition. It has been applied as the cathode of SC-SOFC by Hibino et al., who reported a peak power density of 204 mW cm \u22122 at a furnace temperature of 950 \u00b0C for a cell with 15 wt.% MnO 2 -modified La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 as cathode when operating in a methane\u2013air mixture [8] . The decomposition oxygen partial pressure of LSM is around 10 \u221218 atm at 800 \u00b0C [21] , suggesting that the stability of LSM may still be a problem in SC-SOFC applications when adopting the in situ reduction process for cell initialization, since the oxygen partial pressure in a hydrogen atmosphere could be lower than 10 \u221219 atm. Recently, we have developed a novel perovskite-type oxide La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3 (LSSM) which showed not only better cathode performance than LSM for electrochemical oxygen reduction [22\u201325] but also improved stability under reducing atmosphere [24] . Yue et al. also reported this cathode material which had better performance [26] . This suggests that LSSM may be a potential candidate for an SC-SOFC cathode. In this paper, LSM and LSSM were prepared and their performance in SC-SOFCs operating in a methane\u2013air mixture was systematically investigated. The cell initialization by both ex situ and in situ reduction methods for the two cells was comparatively studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis and fuel cell fabrication The fuel cells employed in this study were in an anode-supported configuration with a NiO + ScSZ anode substrate (\u223c500 \u03bcm, NiO:ScSZ = 60:40 by wt.%), ScSZ electrolyte (20\u201330 \u03bcm) and an LSM or LSSM cathode (\u223c20 \u03bcm). ScSZ, LSM and LSSM were all synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. Such a preparation process has been described in detail in our previous publications [27,28] . A dry-pressing/sintering process was adopted to fabricate the anode-supported thin-film ScSZ bi-layer pellets. These green dual-layer pellets resulting from dry pressing were then fired at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to achieve the densification of the electrolyte layer and a firm connection between the anode substrate and the thin-film electrolyte. The cathode was applied to the electrolyte surface by a spray deposition/sintering process. The cathode powder (LSM or LSSM) was first dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension through high-energy ball milling (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6), at a rotational speed of 400 rpm for 1 h. The resultant slurry was spray deposited onto the electrolyte surface of fresh or pre-reduced dual-layer membranes, then calcined at 1000 \u00b0C (the resulting sample was named LSM 1000 ) and 1150 \u00b0C (LSSM 1150 ) for 2 h in air (or under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere for the cells with a pre-reduced anode) to obtain triple-layered single cells. The resulting coin-shaped cathode had an effective geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 . 2.2 Catalytic characterization The catalytic activity of the LSM or LSSM for methane oxidation was evaluated in a flow-through fixed bed reactor, which is composed of a quartz tube with an inner diameter of \u223c8 mm. About 0.02 g of catalyst (60\u201380 mesh LSM or LSSM particulates) was put in the center of the reactor. A K-type thermocouple with the protection of a small quartz tube was immersed into the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature. A tube furnace was applied to sustain the temperature required for the reaction. Methane\u2013oxygen\u2013helium mixed gas in a ratio of 1.3:1:4 was introduced from the top of the reactor. The effluent gas from the bottom of the reactor was introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, which was equipped with Poraplot Q and 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve capillary columns for the separation of H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 . Before introduction into the reactor, water was adsorbed by a cooling trap. The methane and oxygen conversions were calculated based on: % conversio n C H 4 = [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] outlet \u00d7 100 % conversio n O 2 = 0.5 [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + 0.5 [ H 2 O ] 0.5 [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + 0.5 [ H 2 O ] + [ O 2 ] outlet \u00d7 100 2.3 Fuel cell performance test Fuel cell polarization curves were obtained at furnace temperatures of 750\u2013850 \u00b0C. The gas was composed of methane, oxygen and nitrogen at flow rates of 110, 85 and 340 ml min \u22121 [STP], respectively. I\u2013V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-terminal configuration. Electrochemical characterization of LSM and LSSM as cathode materials on a ScSZ electrolyte was conducted based on a three-electrode configuration using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1287 Potentiostat and a Solartron 1260A Frequency Response Analyzer. The frequency applied ranged from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV. The thickness and diameter of the sintered electrolyte disks were \u223c0.3 and 16 mm, respectively. Isopropyl alcohol-based LSM or LSSM slurry was applied to one side of electrolyte substrate by spray deposition and then calcined at 1000 or 1150 \u00b0C in air for 2 h to act as the working electrode. An Ag paste was adopted as the current collector of the working electrode. Silver paste was also used as the reference electrode by painting a ring around the Pt counter electrode on the other side of the electrolyte pellet. The gap between the counter and reference electrodes was \u223c4 mm. The areas of the working, counter and reference electrodes were 0.26, 0.26 and 0.3 cm 2 , respectively. The cathodic resistances were tested under a constant cathodic current of 400 mA cm \u22122 . 2.4 Other characterization The BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller) surface area of the samples was characterized by N 2 adsorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen using a BELSORP II instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were put in vacuum at 200 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 h to remove the surface adsorbed species. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) was used to analyze the stability of LSM and LSSM against a reducing atmosphere during the process of in situ reduction. The diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 30 mA using Cu K\u03b1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.5418 \u00c5, with a scanning angle (Bragg angle 2 \u03b8 ) ranging from 20\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 at a rate of 0.05\u00b0 s \u22121 . The microscopic features of the electrodes were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, JSM-5610LV). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Special surface areas and catalytic activities The grain size and morphology of the catalysts typically have a significant effect on their catalytic activity [29] . A high specific surface area means more active sites, and thus a higher catalytic activity. In this study, the increase of sintering temperature led to a decreasing specific surface area. Furthermore, a much larger specific surface area of LSSM than LSM at the same calcination temperature was observed, which is likely associated with the excessive amount of HNO 3 added for dissolving Sc 2 O 3 in the synthesis of LSSM powder. The excessive HNO 3 can react with NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O to form NH 4 NO 3 , which is a fine combustion aid in the later pre-fired process [30] . The huge amount of gases produced during combustion can separate the product particles and then effectively suppress their segregation. To obtain a reasonable comparison of the catalytic activity, the sintering temperatures of 1000 \u00b0C for LSM (BET surface area of \u223c1.23 m 2 g \u22121 ) and 1150 \u00b0C for LSSM (BET surface area is \u223c1.50 m 2 g \u22121 ) were chosen to obtain powders with similar specific surface area. These two temperatures were also selected for the fabrication of LSM and LSSM onto the electrolyte surfaces for cell performance tests. Based on Nernst equation, the open-circuit-voltage (OCV) is closely related to the oxygen partial pressure ( P O 2 ) around the electrode surfaces. An ideal cathode material for SC-SOFC should possess high electro-catalytic activity for oxygen reduction but low activity for fuel oxidation. The catalytic activities of the LSM and LSSM powders with similar specific surface areas were then evaluated as a function of operating temperature (600\u2013900 \u00b0C). The molar ratio of methane to oxygen was 1.3:1 (He 40 ml min \u22121 , CH 4 13 ml min \u22121 , O 2 10 ml min \u22121 ) to simulate the gas composition in a SC-SOFC [20] . Here, helium was applied to replace nitrogen for GC analysis purposes. Fig. 1 shows that the conversions of methane and oxygen over an LSSM catalyst are much larger than those of an LSM at the same temperature. This indicates that LSSM had higher catalytic activity than LSM for methane oxidization. Since these two samples had similar morphologies and surface areas, their different activities could be attributed to intrinsic properties such as oxygen reduction capability. It is widely known that the catalytic activity of oxides is closely related to the oxygen reduction capability and especially, the surface concentration of oxygen vacancies [31] . The oxygen vacancies can influence the capacity of oxygen adsorption sites and species on the catalyst (or electrode) surface. The two different models describing this complex reaction process are the Mars van Krevlen (MvK) and Ionic Redox (IoR) models [32,33] . In brief, the MvK model takes into consideration that the reactant is adsorbed and oxidized at some active sites and that the reduced catalyst is then re-oxidized by gas phase molecular oxygen at the same sites. Adsorption of molecular oxygen is assumed to be the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction. The other model believes that the reduction and re-oxidation occur on different sites of the catalyst surface, and that the re-oxidation reactant is not gas oxygen, but lattice oxygen transferred through the oxygen vacancy to the active site of the catalyst surface. The catalytic activity of an oxide is closely related to the concentration of oxygen vacancy on its surface. In general, the more oxygen vacancies, the higher catalytic activity in oxygen reduction will be for the oxide. If the vacancies are occupied by other insulating things including gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, the sites for oxygen reduction will be partially blocked with consequently dropping in electro-catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective technique to characterize the ORR on a cathode, so it is expected that the catalytic activity of the oxide can be indirectly characterized by the EIS. To demonstrate whether oxygen and methane are adsorbed over the same active sites, the EIS of LSM and LSSM oxides under methane\u2013oxygen mixed gases was measured. The oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere was kept at 0.167 atm while the methane partial pressure was varied. To minimize the influence of methane oxidation over the cathode, which could have an impact on the EIS, the methane and oxygen flow rate was kept high to keep the methane conversion under 10%. As shown in Fig. 2 , the methane had almost no impact on the electrochemical oxygen reduction over both cathodes at 800 \u00b0C. This likely suggests that methane and oxygen had different adsorption sites. Therefore, the IoR model more precisely describes the methane oxidation over LSM and LSSM cathodes. Based on the IoR model, the oxygen surface exchange kinetic and bulk oxygen ion conductivity are crucial parameters for the oxide catalyst. The higher the surface activity for oxygen reduction and the higher the oxygen bulk diffusion rate, the higher the methane oxidation rate should be. Since LSSM has a higher bulk and surface oxygen vacancy concentration than LSM [25] , it follows that LSSM should have more catalytic activity than LSM for methane oxidation. Their different catalytic activities towards methane oxidation may cause differences in the oxygen partial pressure over the cathode surface, as well as the different OCVs of the SC-SOFCs. Such influence will be discussed in detail later. 3.2 Electrochemical performance of the cells based on ex situ reduction The current\u2013voltage ( I \u2013 V ) and current\u2013power ( I \u2013 P ) curves of the cells with these two cathodes initialized by the ex situ reduction method were first comparatively tested at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C (furnace temperature) with the results shown in Fig. 3 . For the cell with the LSM cathode (cell A), the peak power densities (PPDs) reached 275 and 225 mW cm \u22122 at 850 and 825 \u00b0C, respectively, which are slightly higher values than those of the cell with the LSSM cathode (cell B). As shown in Fig. 4 , the OCVs of these two cells decreased monotonously with increasing temperature, indicating the methane was actually oxidized via an indirect oxidization mechanism, i.e., it was first partially oxidized to CO and H 2 , which were then oxidized to H 2 O and CO 2 over the anode to produce electricity (Eqs. (2)\u2013(4) ). Within the temperature range tested, the OCVs of cell A were about 0.03\u20130.05 V higher than those of cell B are. During the fuel cell operation, molecular oxygen was first adsorbed over the cathode surface and then dissociated into two oxygen atoms, which combined with electrons to generate lattice oxygen ( O O \u00d7 ) . In DC-SOFCs, the O O \u00d7 diffuse through to the bulk of cathode or diffuse around the electrode surface to the electrolyte surface, and are then transported further through the electrolyte and reacted with fuel over the anode surface to produce electricity (step 1, as shown in Fig. 5 ). However, in the SC-SOFC operation model, the created oxygen ion was also able to proceed in an additional pathway, i.e., the O O \u00d7 diffused back to the oxide surface and reacted with methane to form carbon dioxide and water (step 2). These two reactions preceeded in parallel. The excessive consumption of O O \u00d7 by step 2 resulted in a decreasing concentration of adsorbed oxygen over the perovskite surface. Based on the Nernst equation, the OCV depends on the difference of oxygen partial pressure between the anode and the cathode. Since the LSSM had a higher catalytic activity for methane oxidation, it consumed more adsorbed oxygen than the LSM. Thereby, a lower surface oxygen potential over LSSM than LSM cathode was expected, which then led to a lower OCV. 3.3 Adsorption behavior of carbon dioxide It is well known that carbon dioxide could have a strong effect on the cathodic performance of some perovskite oxides such as BSCF, at intermediate temperature. Since the methane oxidation would produce CO 2 , the effect of CO 2 on the cathode performance over LSM and LSSM needs to be clarified. Fig. 6 shows the EIS of LSM and LSSM at 800 \u00b0C before polarization under various atmospheres composed of CO 2 and O 2 with varied CO 2 concentration but fixed oxygen partial pressure at 0.2 atm. It demonstrates that the sizes of EIS changed little with varying carbon dioxide partial pressure ( P C O 2 ) , especially for the LSSM cathode. This is significantly different from that of the BSCF cathode [34,35] . Such a feature is beneficial for single-chamber application since CO 2 is avoidable in single-chamber fuel cell reactor. Some reports in the literature indicate that there was SrO segregation over perovskite oxide surfaces such as LSM [21,36] and LSCF [37] . The small variation in polarization resistance with varying P C O 2 for an LSM cathode is then likely associated with the adsorption of carbon dioxide on such surface enriched with SrO. Fig. 7 shows the effect of CO 2 on the oxygen reduction activity of LSM and LSSM cathodes after polarization. After polarization at a cathodic current of 400 mA cm \u22122 , the electrode polarization resistance reduced significantly due to the increasing amount of in situ created oxygen vacancies in the bulk and over the surface of the electrode [38,39] . Furthermore, the sensitivity of the EIS with respect to carbon dioxide decreased slightly after polarization, which was attributed to the fact that the surface enriched SrO was incorporated into the LSM lattice during the cathodic polarization [40] . Comparing the results in Figs. 6 B and 7 B, the degree of resistance variation with varying P C O 2 for the LSSM cathode was smaller than that for the LSM. This may be explained by the fact that the SrO generation over perovskite oxides surface was suppressed by the Sc 3+ doping [22] . By this token, one significant advantage of LSM-based electrodes, especially LSSM, over BSCF is their better capacity to resist carbon dioxide poisoning. 3.4 Fuel cell performance adopting in situ reduction Another advantage of LSM-based electrodes over Co-based electrodes such as SSC and BSCF in single-chamber operation may be their better chemical stability against a reducing atmosphere. This suggests that the fuel cells with LSM-based electrodes may adopt a convenient in situ reduction initialization. Fig. 8 shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the cell with an LSSM cathode at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C. Before each test, the whole cell was treated under a hydrogen atmosphere for 1 h at 600 \u00b0C to reduce the NiO in the anode to Ni. Once the reduction was completed, the chamber atmosphere was switched to a methane\u2013air mixed gas. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , the steady state PPDs reached 240 and 202 mW cm \u22122 at 850 and 825 \u00b0C, respectively, which are comparable values to that of the cell initialized by ex situ reduction. This indicates that the in situ reduction process did not have an obvious effect on the structure and composition of the LSSM cathode. Such a conclusion is supported by the XRD results as shown in Fig. 9 . It can be seen that the LSSM had stable perovskite structure after the pretreatment in a hydrogen atmosphere at 600 \u00b0C for an hour. In order to further demonstrate the stability of LSSM in the process of the in situ reduction method, the performance of the cell with the LSM cathode was tested in the same way. As shown in Fig. 10 , although this cell also showed a relatively stable performance after exposure to a methane and air mixture gas, it delivered a peak power density of just 90 mW cm \u22122 at 800 \u00b0C as compared to \u223c225 mW cm \u22122 for the cell following ex situ reduction. Based on the preliminary analysis of Fig. 11 , the perovskite structure of the LSM was destroyed after the treatment in a hydrogen atmosphere at 600 \u00b0C for 1 h. This suggests that the phase reduction could be a cause for the reduced cell performance. However, it was reported that some perovskite materials have very good phase reversibility [16,20] ; once the oxidant atmosphere was recovered, the reduced material could restore its perovskite phase structure at high temperature easily. Previously, we have demonstrated that the reduced BSCF could partially restore its perovskite structure after switching on a methane\u2013air mixture at high temperature [20] . The phase reversibility of LSM was then tested. After the reduction of LSM by hydrogen, a mixed gas composed of methane and air with similar ratio for the single-chamber operation was switched on and treated at 800 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. As shown in Fig. 11 C, the perovskite structure was perfectly restored. This suggests that the destruction of the phase structure by hydrogen may not be the reason for the reduced performance in the in situ reduction process for the cell initialization with the LSM cathode. It is well known that the electrode performance is related with not only to the material's intrinsic properties, but also its microstructure. Fig. 12 shows the cross-sectional SEM photos of the cells with fresh, hydrogen-reduced and re-oxidized LSM cathode by methane and air mixed gas, respectively. There is no evidence clearing showing that the electrode microstructure changed significantly. However, Fig. 12 does not have the resolution to elucidate if there was structure change at the nano scale. The possible microstructure change in the microdomain of the LSM cathode during the reduction/re-oxidation process was supported by the impedances of the electrode. Fig. 13 shows the impedance spectroscopes of the cell with LSM initialized by in situ reduction and ex situ reduction, where it is clearly shown that the electrode polarization resistance and the ohmic resistance of the cell initialized by in situ reduction method are both larger than the cell initialized by the ex situ reduction method. To understand such a difference, the expansion properties of LSM and LSSM samples were applied. The samples were first pressed into quadrate bars, and then fired at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to get dense bars with an original size of 2.74 mm \u00d7 17.47 mm \u00d7 5.40 mm. After exposure to a 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere for 24 h at 900 \u00b0C, the volume of the LSM bar was found to increase by 5.0% of its original size, compared to 0.91% for the LSSM. Furthermore, it was also found that the crystallite sizes of fresh LSM and re-oxidized LSM were, 17.05 and 20.46 nm, respectively, i.e., the crystallite size was increased after the reduction/re-oxidation process. Based on the above analysis, a mechanism was proposed for the reduced cell performance via the in situ reduction for cell initialization, as shown in Fig. 14 . During the in situ reduction process, the LSM was reduced, which led to the expansion of the oxide and caused a strong tension inside the electrode. To release the tension, some electrode\u2013electrolyte connections were broken, which could happen on the nano scale. This then led to an increase in interfacial polarization resistance. During the oxidation process, the oxide shrank, which again created internal stress, such that some of the closely contacted electrode particles might separated during this oxidation process and resulting in an increase in contact resistance. Both points result in the deterioration of fuel cell performance by increasing the electrode polarization resistance and the ohmic resistance, as shown in Fig. 13 . 4 Conclusions La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.1 Mn 0.9 O 3 were synthesized and characterized as cathode materials of SC-SOFCs. LSSM had higher activity than LSM for the oxidization of methane because more oxygen vacancies were created due to the Sc 3+ doping. Such oxygen vacancies also had a crucial role in oxygen reduction and methane oxidation. CH 4 and O 2 adsorbed on different active sites over both the LSM and LSSM cathodes. The cell with the LSSM cathode had lower OCVs than the cell with the LSM cathode due to the higher catalytic activity of LSSM for methane oxidation. The higher activity of LSSM for oxygen reduction along with its higher activity for methane oxidation than the LSM resulted in comparable power output for the cell with the LSSM cathode and the cell with the LSM cathode. The oxidation CO 2 product had a negligible effect on the oxygen reduction over both the LSM and LSSM cathode, which is a significant advantage for single-chamber fuel cell application. LSSM is amenable to in situ reduction due to its improved chemical stability. Similar performance was observed for the cells with LSSM cathode initialized by in situ reduction and ex situ reduction. However, LSM can be reduced under a hydrogen atmosphere. Although the phase reversibility of LSM is really good, the electrode morphology might be changed at the nano scale during the reduction and re-oxidation process, resulting in the reduced cathode performance. As a whole, LSSM is a promising SC-SOFC cathode material.

        "abstract": "Various Ni-LaxCe1-xOy composites were synthesized and their catalytic activity, catalytic stability and carbon deposition properties for steam reforming of methane were investigated. Among the catalysts, Ni-La0.1Ce0.9Oy showed the highest catalytic performance and also the best coking resistance. The Ni-LaxCe1-xOy catalysts with a higher Ni content were further sintered at 1400 \u00b0C and investigated as anodes of solid oxide fuel cells for operating on methane fuel. The Ni-La0.1Ce 0.9Oy anode presented the best catalytic activity and coking resistance in the various Ni-LaxCe1-xOy catalysts with different ceria contents. In addition, the Ni-La 0.1Ce0.9Oy also showed improved coking resistance over a Ni-SDC cermet anode due to its improved surface acidity. A fuel cell with a Ni-La0.1Ce0.9Oy anode and a catalyst yielded a peak power density of 850 mW cm-2 at 650 \u00b0C while operating on a CH4-H2O gas mixture, which was only slightly lower than that obtained while operating on hydrogen fuel. No obvious carbon deposition or nickel aggregation was observed on the Ni-La 0.1Ce0.9Oy anode after the operation on methane. Such remarkable performances suggest that nickel and La-doped CeO 2 composites are attractive anodes for direct hydrocarbon SOFCs and might also be used as catalysts for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons.\u00a9 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "The effect of lanthanide promoters on a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst for methane partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming at 600\u2013850 \u00b0C is systematically investigated. The promoters include La 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , Pr 2 O 3 , Sm 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 . GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 shows comparable catalytic activity to LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 but higher activity than CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 for all three reactions. The O 2 -TPO results show that GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 possesses the best coke resistance among those tested. It also displays good stability at 850 \u00b0C for 300 h. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the addition of lanthanide promoters can reduce the degree of graphitization of the carbon deposited on Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 . The GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 is further applied as an anode functional layer in solid-oxide fuel cells operating on methane. The cell yields peak power densities of 1068, 996 and 986 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C, respectively, for operating on methane\u2013O 2 , methane\u2013H 2 O and methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures, which is comparable to operating on hydrogen fuel. GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 is promising as a highly coking-resistant catalyst layer for solid-oxide fuel cells. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Nickel\u2013alumina Anode catalyst layer Methane Carbon deposition Lanthanide promotion 1 Introduction As the main component of natural gas, coal-bed gas and biogas with huge reserves, methane is a clean fuel and also an important raw material for the synthesis of many important chemicals such as hydrogen and methanol. The conversion of methane to synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of CO and H 2 , is an important step toward the utilization of methane in chemical synthesis. Syngas can be produced from methane by catalytic partial oxidation (CH 4 + 1/2O 2 = CO + 2H 2 , \u0394 H 298 K = \u221236 kJ mol \u22121 ), steam reforming (CH 4 + H 2 O = CO + 3H 2 , \u0394 H 298 K = 206 kJ mol \u22121 ), or CO 2 reforming (CH 4 + CO 2 = 2CO + 2H 2 , \u0394 H 298 K = 247 kJ mol \u22121 ). The above three reactions create products with different H 2 to CO ratios and are suitable for the synthesis of different chemicals [1] . Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that can directly convert chemical energy to electrical power with high efficiency and low emissions. Among the many types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which typically operate at 500\u20131000 \u00b0C, have received particular attention recently. The elevated operational temperature allows for fuel flexibility. In principle, SOFCs can operate on any combustible fuel [2\u20136] . As the simplest hydrocarbon, methane is considered to be an attractive fuel for SOFCs because it has several advantages such as ease and safety of storage and also being handled and delivered with the existing supply infrastructure. Nickel cermets are the most commonly used anodes in hydrogen-fueled SOFCs due to their high electrochemical activity for hydrogen electro-oxidation and long-term stability at SOFC operating conditions [7,8] . However, they suffer from a number of drawbacks when operating on hydrocarbon fuels, notably carbon deposition, which covers the active sites of the anodes and causes rapid and irreversible cell deterioration. To overcome those disadvantages, substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of new non-nickel anode materials in recent years [9\u201312] . The most investigated materials include copper-based cermet and perovskite-type oxides. However, those materials decreased not only the carbon deposition rate but also the electrochemical activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. The modification of conventional nickel cermet anodes has also been tried and is more advisable due to its simplicity. Recently, the Barnett group successfully directly operated SOFCs with a conventional nickel cermet anode on methane, propane and other hydrocarbons without pre-reforming by modification of the anode with a Ru\u2013CeO 2 functional layer [13\u201315] . However, Ru is expensive, making it less attractive for practical applications. Some supported group VIII metals are known to be good catalyst candidates for methane conversion reactions to give a high yield of syngas at elevated temperatures [16\u201320] . Very recently, we have demonstrated that a cost-effective Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst presented good catalytic activity comparable to Ru\u2013CeO 2 . When operating on methane-containing fuels, the fuel cell with a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 anode functional layer yielded high power output comparable to that with hydrogen. In addition, the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer showed much better thermal\u2013mechanical compatibility with the cermet anode than Ru\u2013CeO 2 [21,22] . As mentioned, one practical problem with a nickel-based catalyst is the coke-induced deactivation. It is thought that metal oxides alter the activity of the supported metal catalysts depending on the nature of the additives. Catalyst modification can cause the blockage of active sites on the metal surface or changes in the electronic character or geometric structure of the catalyst surface, thus changing the reactivity by interacting with the substrate to alter its mode of adsorption [23] . There is evidence in the literature indicating an improvement in the catalytic activity of Ni-based catalysts in hydrocarbon steam/CO 2 reforming and partial oxidation with the addition of lanthanide elements [24\u201330] . Zhuang et al. and Wang et al. have investigated the effect of cerium oxide as a promoter in supported Ni catalysts for methane steam and CO 2 reforming [24,25] . There was a beneficial effect with not only a decrease in the carbon deposition rate but also an increase in the reforming activity. The researchers believed that the cerium oxide accelerated the reaction of steam with the adsorbed species on the nickel surface and thus decreased the carbon deposition rate as well as increased or maintained the high catalytic activity. Yang et al. have reported that La 2 O 3 and CeO 2 co-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst for the methane CO 2 reforming reaction. Not only was the amount of carbon deposition decreased, but the activity was also improved slightly using the Ni/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 with the La 2 O 3 \u2013CeO 2 binary promoters, due to the alkaline function and dispersion action of La 2 O 3 \u2013CeO 2 as well as the electronic interactions between CeO 2 and Ni [31] . In our previous work, we have demonstrated that a lithium and lanthanum co-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst has an excellent catalytic activity for the partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming of methane between 600 and 850 \u00b0C and good coking resistance and operational stability [32] . In this study, the effect of lanthanide promoters on the catalytic activity of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst for methane reforming and partial oxidation reactions and coke resistance was systematically investigated. The Gd-modified Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was further investigated as an anode functional layer operating under real fuel cell conditions with methane as the fuel. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication All of the catalyst powders were synthesized using a glycine nitrite process (GNP), which was described previously [33] . The resultant primary powders from the direct combustion were further calcined at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h in static air to obtain the desired catalysts. After cooling to room temperature, the powder was pressed into disk-shaped pellets and then crushed to small grains with the desired particle size for the catalytic tests. The fuel cell materials included a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathode, a (Y 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (YSZ) electrolyte and a NiO + YSZ anode (NiO:YSZ = 60:40, by weight). The LSM was synthesized using a standard combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process with metal nitrates (analytical reagents) applied as the raw materials [34] , while the NiO and YSZ used for the anode were commercial products (Chengdu Shudu Nano-science Co., Ltd. for NiO and Tosoh for YSZ). The disk-shaped anode substrates were first prepared using a tape-casting technique. The green anode pellets were fired at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to release the organic solvents and to create the proper mechanical strength for the substrate. The YSZ colloidal suspension was prepared by dispersing a fine YSZ powder into a solution of ethylene glycol (5 wt.% solids content) through high-energy ball milling (Fritsch, Pulverisette 6), which was then spray deposited onto the anode substrates. The obtained green anode\u2013electrolyte dual layer half-cells were sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The LSM + YSZ composite cathode (70:30, by weight) was deposited on the sintered electrolyte surface and then fired at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. To prepare the catalyst layer, a slurry of the catalyst powder was first prepared and then was screen-painted onto the outer surface of the anode layer and sintered at 850 \u00b0C for 1 h. 2.2 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic activity of the lanthanide-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts was tested in a flow-through type fixed-bed quartz-tube reactor with an inner diameter of about 8 mm. About 0.2 g of the catalyst particles in the size range of a 40\u201360 mesh were placed into the middle of the reactor. The gas mixtures were fed into the reactor at the flow rates of CH 4 /O 2 /He = 10/5/80, CH 4 /H 2 O/He = 10/10/80 and CH 4 /CO 2 /He = 10/10/80 ml min \u22121 [STP] for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane, respectively. The gases, controlled by AFC 80MD digital mass flow controllers (Qualiflow), were introduced to the top of the reactor. Compositional analysis of the effluent gases from the bottom of the reactor was performed with a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, which was equipped with Hayesep Q, Poraplot Q and 5 \u00c5 sieve molecular capillary columns and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the separation and detection of H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 . The catalytic reactions were performed at 600\u2013850 \u00b0C. The conversion of methane ( X (%)) during the partial oxidation and steam reforming of methane was calculated according to Eq. (1) . Alternatively, the conversion of methane during CO 2 reforming was calculated according to Eq. (2) , and the selectivity of CO ( S (%)) was calculated according to Eq. (3) . The H 2 to CO ratios ( R ) were calculated according to Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) for partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane, respectively: (1) X ( % ) = [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] + [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 % (2) X ( % ) = 0.5 \u00d7 [ CO ] 0.5 \u00d7 [ CO ] + [ C H 4 ] \u00d7 100 % (3) S ( % ) = [ CO ] [ CO ] + [ C O 2 ] \u00d7 100 % (4) R = 4 S [ CO ] % \u2212 1 S [ CO ] % \u00d7 X [ C H 4 ] % \u2212 1 (5) R = 4 S [ CO ] % \u2212 1 (6) R = 4 \u00d7 X [ C H 4 ] % S [ CO ] % + S [ CO ] % \u00d7 X [ C H 4 ] % \u2212 1 2.3 Characterizations Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was used to identify the chemical interaction between the nickel and the support and/or the promoters. Approximately 0.03 g of catalyst particles were put in a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of about 3 mm. The sample was pretreated under a pure argon atmosphere at a flow rate of 30 ml min \u22121 [STP] at 400 \u00b0C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the atmosphere was switched to 10 vol.% H 2 /Ar, and the reactor was programmatically heated to 930 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The hydrogen consumption was monitored by an in situ TCD detector with a BELCAT-A apparatus. To test the coke resistance of the lanthanide-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts, about 0.2 g of catalyst particles were first placed in a flow-through type quartz-tube reactor and treated at 850 \u00b0C under a pure methane atmosphere at a flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP] for 5 min and then cooled to room temperature in a helium atmosphere. After the treatment, approximately 0.05 g of powder was placed into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of about 3 mm. Pure oxygen (for oxygen temperature-programmed oxidization, O 2 -TPO) at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was then introduced to the top of the reactor. After flowing with the gas at room temperature for about 30 min to stabilize the baseline, the reactor was heated to 800 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The deposited carbon on the catalyst surface was gradually oxidized to CO 2 . The effluent gas from the reactor was connected to a mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden QIC-20) for in situ monitoring of CO 2 . The CO 2 -TPD process was performed to test the surface basicity of the catalysts. The samples were first reduced in hydrogen at 850 \u00b0C for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and then exposed to CO 2 (20 ml min \u22121 ) for 2 h. The treated samples were purged with Ar at room temperature for 1 h and heated linearly at 10\u2013800 \u00b0C in a flowing Ar atmosphere at 20 ml min \u22121 . The CO 2 signal was monitored and recorded continuously as a function of the temperature by the MS. The phase structures of the various samples were examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, ARL X\u2019 TRA) equipped with a Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.1541 nm). The BET specific surface area of the catalysts was characterized by N 2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using a surface area analyzer (BELSORP II, Japan). Prior to nitrogen adsorption, the sample was degassed at 300 \u00b0C for 2.0 h to remove any physically adsorbed species. The surface area was determined from the linear portion of the BET equation. The laser Raman spectroscopy of the various catalysts after treated at 850 \u00b0C under a pure CH 4 atmosphere for 5 min was obtained in an HR800 UV Raman microspectrometer (JOBIN YVON, France) using the green line of an argon laser ( \u03bb = 514.53 nm) as the excitation source. The cross-sectional morphologies of the fuel cells were examined using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-200). The I \u2013 V polarization curves of the fuel cells measured at 650\u2013850 \u00b0C were obtained using a Keithley 2420 source meter in 4-probe mode. During the measurements, hydrogen, CH 4 \u2013O 2 , CH 4 \u2013H 2 O or CH 4 \u2013CO 2 gas mixtures were fed into the anode chamber and ambient air was served as the oxidant gas at in the cathode chamber. The flow rate of hydrogen and methane was maintained at 80 ml min \u22121 [STP]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Basic properties The development of active and stable catalysts for methane conversion to syngas is critical for methane utilization in chemical synthesis. On the other hand, an ideal material for the anode functional layer of SOFCs operating on methane should possess high activity for all three reactions (partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane) because the CO 2 , and H 2 O could co-present with the methane under polarization by introducing methane and oxygen as the anode feed gases. We have previously demonstrated that a Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 (7 wt.% Ni) catalyst prepared by a glycine nitrate combustion process had good activity for the afore-mentioned three reactions at intermediate temperatures. To further improve the catalytic performance, a series of lanthanides (La 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , Pr 2 O 3 , Sm 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 ) were applied as promoters to modify the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Five new catalysts, i.e., LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 were prepared by the same combustion method, and for comparison, Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 was also synthesized. In all six catalysts, the nickel content was fixed at 15 wt.% and the molar ratio of promoters to nickel was fixed at 0.12:1. The contents of the promoters were 5.00, 5.28, 5.06, 5.35 and 5.56 wt.% for LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , respectively. It is interesting that all of the catalysts were light blue in color except for the CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , which was light green. The XRD results are shown in Fig. 1 . As shown, the \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 and NiAl 2 O 4 phases were detected in all of the samples. No other phase like NiO was observed in the LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 . These results suggest that the La, Pr, Sm and Gd oxides were all well-dispersed within the catalysts. However, the CeO 2 phase was detected in the CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , which agreed well with the literature [31,35] . This result implies that CeO 2 likely did not enter into the bulk phase of the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The existence of the yellowish-color CeO 2 should explain the green color of CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 . The specific surface areas were determined using the nitrogen adsorption method at the liquid nitrogen temperature and were 51.3, 69.5, 79.0, 52.7, 56.2 and 68.3 m 2 g \u22121 for LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , respectively. These findings indicate that the promoters affected the specific surface area of the catalysts. It has been reported that a maximum BET surface area of La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 composites exists, changing with the La 2 O 3 loading (La/Al ratio). However, the La/Al ratio having the maximum BET value varies between investigations depending on the different preparation conditions [36,37] . Chen et al. found that the specific surface area of the La 2 O 3 -promoted Al 2 O 3 samples was higher than that of the pure Al 2 O 3 sample when La/Al \u2264 0.02 and that the maximum specific surface area was achieved at a La/Al atomic ratio of 0.02. For La/Al \u2265 0.05, the specific surface areas of the La 2 O 3 -promoted aluminum samples decreased rapidly with the increase in the La/Al atomic ratio [36] . Roh et al. also reported that the largest specific surface area of a LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was obtained at the La/Al atomic ratio of 0.02 [38] , while Haack et al. have reported that the maximum specific surface area was achieved at a La/Al atomic ratio of 0.15 [37] . In this study, the specific surface area of LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 (La/Al = 0.022) was relatively smaller than that of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , which was different from the literature cited above. This phenomenon may be attributable to the different preparation method we used in this study. The specific surface area of the CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 was very close to the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 . Wang et al. have demonstrated the effect of different cerium contents on the specific surface areas of the CeO 2 -promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts, and the specific surface area of Ni\u20131 wt.% CeO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 was slightly higher than that of the unpromoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, while Ni\u20135 wt.% CeO 2 \u2013Al 2 O 3 has about the same specific surface area as that of Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 [25] . In this study, the content of CeO 2 was 5.28 wt.%, and thus, the surface area results agree well with the literature. Guo et al. have reported on the effect of the Gd 2 O 3 content on the BET surface area in a Ni\u2013SiO 2 system [39] . The authors believed that the surface area of Ni\u2013SiO 2 decreased with the addition of Gd 2 O 3 . Our results with the Gd-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst showed the same trend as their observations, although the supports were different. The chemical interaction between the nickel and the support and/or the promoters was characterized by H 2 -TPR. Fig. 2 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the various catalysts. The reduction peak temperature of the free NiO during the H 2 -TPR process was reported to be around 330 \u00b0C [40] . With the increase in the chemical interaction between the NiO and the support or promoters, a shift of the reduction peak to higher temperatures was expected. The reduction peak temperatures of the six catalysts were all higher than 800 \u00b0C, suggesting a strong interaction between the nickel and the support (\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 ) or the promoters in the various catalysts synthesized by the GNP method. Such interaction could effectively suppress the grain growth of the NiO phase that is beneficial for increasing the catalytic activity of the catalysts. The peak temperatures were 832, 823, 832, 832, 833 and 823 \u00b0C for the LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , respectively. These findings indicate that the lanthanide additives could affect the metal-support interaction with the exception of the CeO 2 additive. The same peak reduction temperatures of CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 can be explained by the lack of a strong chemical interaction between the CeO 2 and the support as demonstrated by the XRD. 3.2 Catalytic performance Fig. 3 shows the methane conversion and CO selectivity for the LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane with the methane to O 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:1, respectively. All five of the catalysts showed favorable catalytic activity for the three reactions at high temperatures (750\u2013850 \u00b0C), which may be attributable to the relatively strong interaction between the NiO and the support. However, a decrease in the operational temperature led to different activities. Table 1 lists the detailed methane conversion over the five catalysts at 600 \u00b0C. It shows that the catalytic activities of the CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts were a little lower than those of the PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts. For example, the CH 4 conversion over the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst reached 86.2, 77.7 and 75.4% for the methane partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming reactions, respectively, while they were 82.7, 71.8 and 71.4%, respectively, over the CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The H 2 to CO ratio is an important factor to evaluate the catalysts during the syngas production reactions of methane [41\u201346] . The H 2 to CO ratios of the five catalysts in the methane partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming reactions in this study are listed in Table 2 . The H 2 to CO ratios of all the catalysts at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C were near the theoretical values of 2.0, 3.0 and 1.0 for the methane partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming reactions, respectively. The H 2 to CO ratios could meet the different requirements for the production of many chemicals, such as HCHO and CH 3 COOH. The H 2 to CO ratios increased with decreasing reaction temperatures for the methane partial oxidation and steam reforming reactions and the H 2 to CO ratio almost remained stable for the CO 2 reforming reaction. Liu et al. have reported similar results for the methane partial oxidation reaction [45] . Daza et al. have demonstrated that the H 2 to CO ratios almost remained stable for the CO 2 reforming reaction, which agrees with our results [46] . 3.3 Carbon deposition The catalyst stability for the methane conversion is closely related to the coke formation. Previously, we have demonstrated that the LiLaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 (7 wt.% Ni) catalyst had better coke resistance than the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 [32] . The carbon deposition behavior of the lanthanide-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts was then investigated. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding O 2 -TPO profiles of the catalysts after treatment in methane at 850 \u00b0C. The CO 2 peak areas were 1.76 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.98 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 2.35 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.44 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.23 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 5.63 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 , respectively. The area of the CO 2 peak reflects the amount of carbon deposited on the catalysts, which was quantitatively determined by applying pure SrCO 3 as an external standard substance. Table 3 shows the area-specific carbon formation rates over the various catalysts. These results indicated that the introduction of lanthanides to the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst increased the coking resistance. The GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst had the best coking resistance. It is interesting that CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 was very different from the other four catalysts. This phenomenon may be because the CeO 2 did not enter the bulk phase in the catalyst, as evidenced by the XRD and TPR characterizations. The coke resistance regulation in the LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts agreed with the ionic radius of the corresponding promoter elements. Some promoters could create a steric effect, such as blocking certain catalytic sites or the adsorption/desorption modes of specific molecular geometries on the surface of the catalyst. The amount of deposited carbon also depended on the difference between the carbenium adsorption and desorption rates. The amount of adsorbed carbenium was controlled by the thermodynamic process. The desorption rate of the carbenium on the catalyst should be affected by the structure of the catalyst. It has been reported that the carbon deposition property of the supported catalyst is related to the steric hindrance of the catalyst [47] . The Gd 3+ had the smallest ionic radius of 0.94 \u00c5 of the five elements in this study and the good coke resistance of GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 should be attributable to the steric effect of the promoter. To investigate the structures of the deposited carbon, the laser Raman spectroscopy of the five carbon-deposited samples were measured. As shown in Fig. 5 , the Raman spectra showed two intense bands, with the first one at 1350 cm \u22121 (usually called the D-band) associated with the disorder structure of carbon and the second one at 1580 cm \u22121 (usually called the G-band) assigned to the in-plane vibrations of the carbon atoms in hexagonal sheets [48] . The graphitization degree of the deposited carbon was related to the integrated intensity ratio in the form of R ( I D / I G ) [49] . According to the literature, the R -values should decrease with the increasing carbon graphitization degree [50] . The R -values of the deposited carbon over the LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 at 850 \u00b0C were 1.63, 1.32, 1.38, 1.21, 1.05 and 0.86, respectively. These findings indicate that the addition of various lanthanides could effectively decrease the graphitization degree of the carbon deposited over the catalysts. To further exploit the coke resistance of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, the catalyst was treated in pure methane at various temperatures and then subjected to the O 2 -TPO analysis. Fig. 6 presents the O 2 -TPO profiles of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst after treatment in methane at 650\u2013850 \u00b0C. The CO 2 peak areas were 1.23 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 2.52 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 3.60 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 7.85 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.10 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 850, 800, 750, 700 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. The area-specific carbon formation rates of the corresponding temperatures were 7.70 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.58 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 2.26 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , 4.92 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 6.90 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol m \u22122 min \u22121 , respectively. These results indicate an increase in the coke formation rate with a decrease in the reaction temperature for the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Based on the hydrocarbon cracking reaction thermodynamics, an increase in the reaction temperature should not cause a decrease in the rate of coke formation. However, coke is the product of the inter-reactions between carbenium ions on the catalyst surface. Thus, due to an increase in the desorption rate, fewer carbenium ions were present on the catalyst surface at high temperatures. As a result, the rate of coke formation decreased with an increase in temperature [51] . It is well known that an acidic catalyst surface favors carbon deposition, while a basic one suppresses carbon deposition [52] . To test the surface basicity of the lanthanide-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts, the CO 2 -TPD process was performed. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding CO 2 -TPD profiles of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts. No absorption peak existed at the region above 600 \u00b0C, which implied that no carbonate was produced in our CO 2 -TPD process. The CO 2 peak areas were 1.22 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 4.53 \u00d7 10 \u22127 for the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 and GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , respectively. Thus, the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst had a higher surface basicity than the Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 . This result showed that the good coke resistance of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 should be attributable to the steric effect of the Gd 2 O 3 promoter and the large surface basicity of the catalyst. 3.4 Long-term catalyst stability To evaluate the operational stability, the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was tested for methane partial oxidation under the conditions of CH 4 :O 2 = 2:1 at 850 \u00b0C for a period of 300 h. Fig. 8 shows the corresponding methane conversion and the H 2 to CO ratio. The methane conversion was stable at approximately 99% and the H 2 to CO ratio stayed around 2.0 during the 300 h operation. The catalytic deactivation of the \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 -supported catalysts during high-temperature operations is typically due to the thermal deterioration of the \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 support, i.e., the sintering and phase transformation into the low-surface area \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 [53] . Rare earth metal oxides could prevent the alumina support from thermal deterioration [54] . The rare earth oxides also have a high oxygen storage capacity and can absorb or release oxygen reversibly in response to the oxygen concentration in the gas-phase [55] . Their presence shows beneficial effects on the catalyst performance, such as improving the dispersion of the active species and delaying the transition of the alumina support from \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 to \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 [56,57] . The strong interaction between the NiO species and the Al 2 O 3 , the good coking resistance and the high surface basicity of GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 , as evidenced by the H 2 -TPR, O 2 -TPO and CO 2 -TPD results, largely contributed to the excellent stability of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst. 3.5 Single cell performance The GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst was then investigated as the anode functional layer in a single cell. Fig. 9 shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the fuel cell operating on a methane\u2013O 2 gas mixture, a methane\u2013H 2 O gas mixture and a methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixture. The methane to O 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 ratios were 4:1, 2:1 and 2:1, respectively. By applying the methane\u2013O 2 gas mixtures as the fuel, the cell delivered peak power densities of 1068, 832, 618, 450 and 285 mW cm \u22122 at 850, 800, 750, 700 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively, while they were 1054, 805, 580, 413 and 247 mW cm \u22122 when pure hydrogen was applied as the fuel. These results showed that the cell power outputs were similar for operating on methane\u2013O 2 fuel and hydrogen fuel. The cell delivered similar power outputs by operating on methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures. For example, the peak power densities at 850 \u00b0C were 996 or 986 mW cm \u22122 when methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures served as fuels, respectively. These results indicate that the catalyst layer had sufficient catalytic activity for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane. The cell stability with the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer under a specific current density at 750 \u00b0C was then investigated. As shown in Fig. 10 , methane\u2013O 2 gas mixtures (CH 4 :O 2 = 4:1) were investigated as the cell fuel. Under a current density of 600 mA cm \u22122 , the voltage was stable at about 0.70 V during the entire 400 min test and the corresponding power density was stable at about 420 mW cm \u22122 . This good stability should contribute to the excellent coking resistance of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst, as evidenced by the O 2 -TPO results. The SEM image of the fuel cell after the cell performance and stability test between 650 and 850 \u00b0C under different fuel conditions for a period of 15 h is shown in Fig. 11 . The catalyst layer still adhered to the anode surface fairly well. The above results indicate that the coking resistant GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst can be used as the functional layer of SOFCs operating on methane fuel. 4 Conclusions The combustion-synthesized lanthanide-promoted Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts had good catalytic activity for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane at elevated temperatures. The catalytic activity of the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 was comparable to those of the LaNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and PrNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts but was higher than those of the CeNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 and SmNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The strong interaction between the NiO and the support accounted for the high activity of the catalysts. The GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst also presented the best coke resistance under pure methane conditions among all of the catalysts, and it remained stable under the conditions of CH 4 :O 2 = 2:1 for 300 h at 850 \u00b0C. A fuel cell with a GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer yielded high cell performance when operating on methane\u2013O 2 , methane\u2013H 2 O or methane\u2013CO 2 gas mixtures. The cell with the GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was stable when operating on methane\u2013O 2 mixtures at 750 \u00b0C for 400 min. The excellent catalytic activity and stability and the high coking resistance of GdNi\u2013Al 2 O 3 indicate a promising application as the catalyst layer in SOFCs operating on methane.

Oxygen is normally obtained from air by one of the three conventional processes: the distillation of cryogenic air (for large scale production), pressure swing adsorption and vacuum swing adsorption (for applications requiring oxygen purities <93%). The cost of the process depends on the required purity and the production scale. Recently the oxygen separation based on the electrochemical membrane has also received considerable attentions due to its simplicity in operation and potential reduction in the capital cost. Due to the requirement of external power supply, the oxygen separation by ion transport membrane (ITM) technique is complicated in reactor design. Fortunately, the recent advances in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) system solved many of the scientific and technological problems for the oxygen generating based on the ITM technique. Traditionally, precious metals like Pt were used as the electrodes and yattria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the electrolyte membrane, which have the drawbacks of high price and low electrode performance, and low ionic conductivity, respectively [1\u20135] . The application of perovskite-type mixed conducting oxide as the electrode and doped ceria as the electrolyte membrane has received attentions due to their much better performance [6,7] . Recently, Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) is developed for low-temperature SOFCs [8\u201313] . The material shows an excellent cathode performance at the reduced temperature, because of its high rapid surface exchange kinetics [14] , the mixed conductivity and high oxygen vacancy concentration [15,16] . An ASR for BSCF cathode of 0.020 and 0.035 \u03a9 cm 2 were obtained at 700 \u00b0C by Shao and Haile [8] and Lee et al. [9] , respectively. The BSCF-based materials, such as BSCF + Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC), also show outstanding performance. Wei et al. reports that the 70 wt.% BSCF mixed with 30 wt.% SDC achieved an ASR of 0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 \u00b0C [10] . In the present work, we reported a high performance electrode for the oxygen generator cell based on SDC ITM. A double-layered composite electrode based on BSCF perovskite oxide was applied both for the cathode and anode of the electrochemical oxygen generator cell. Very low electrode over potential was observed. The ultra-low polarization resistances of the electrodes at intermediate temperature together with the high ionic conductivity of SDC electrolyte membrane make the current ITM oxygen generator cell highly attractive for the efficient and competitive oxygen generation. 2 Experimental BSCF and SDC powders were synthesized via a non-ion selective combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process. Stoichiometric amount of metal nitrates were first prepared into a mixed solution. EDTA\u2013ammonia aqueous solution and solid citric acid were then added to the solution in sequence at the EDTA:citric acid:metal ions mole ratio of 1:2:1. After heating at 80 \u00b0C for several hours a transparent gel was obtained, which was solidified by pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C for several hours. The solid precursor was finally calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h under air to result in the final product of BSCF and SDC. The SDC powder was uni-axially dry-pressed into disk-shape membranes with a diameter of 15 mm at 200 MPa, which were then sintered at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h under air at a heating and cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The sintered SDC pellet was ca . 0.4 mm thick and ca . 12 mm in diameter. The relative density of these pellets was higher than 98% as measured by the Archimedes method. To prepare the composite electrode, the BSCF and SDC powders with the weight ratio of 70:30 were first dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethyleneglycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension by high energy ball milling (Fritsch Pulverisettle 6) at the rotation rate of 400 rpm for 30 min. The obtained slurry was painted symmetrically on the both central surfaces of the SDC membrane with a rectangle shape. A mixture of BSCF (49 wt.%) + SDC (21 wt.%) + Ag (30 wt.%) was painted on the both electrode surfaces as the second layer of the electrode. The electrode performance was investigated with the symmetric cell configuration by a.c. impedance method using an electrochemical workstation of Solartron 1287 potentiostat + 1260 frequency response analyzer. The frequency range applied was from 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz with signal amplitude of 10 mV. The phase structures and morphology of the successive layers were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). Electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe dc technique, using Ag paste as electrodes. The current and the voltage were detected by the Keithley 2420 source meter at intervals of 5 \u00b0C over a temperature range of 350\u2013725 \u00b0C. The performance of the oxygen generator cell was tested with the setup as shown in Fig. 1 . The membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) was in place on the top of the quartz tube using a silver paste. The cathode side was exposed to ambient air atmosphere. The electrical power was applied to the MEA by a Keithely 2420 sourcemeter. The other side of the tube was connected with a homemade soap bubble meter with the accuracy of 0.1 ml for measuring the oxygen-pumping rate. The total volume of the measuring chamber was around 50 cm 3 . Before introducing pumped oxygen into the soap bubble meter, the oxygen stream was firstly cooled down to the room temperature by a cooling equipment. The testing was performed from 600 to 800 \u00b0C with the applied current varied from 0.5 to 2.5 A. To detect the actual temperature of the cell, another thermocouple was attached on the side of the cell. The standardized actual oxygen flow rate ( Q A ) was calculated by equation: (1) Q A = Q T 0 T P 0 P where Q is the oxygen flow rate measured by soap bubble meter, T the ambient temperature, P the atmosphere pressure, and T 0 and P 0 are the standard temperature and pressure. The theoretical oxygen flow rate ( Q T ) is calculated by equation: (2) Q T = I 4 F where I is the electrical current and F is the Faraday's constant. So the Faraday efficiency can be calculated by equation: (3) Faraday \u2009 efficiency = Q A Q T . 3 Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows the SEM morphologies of the MEA with the identical double-layered electrode both for the anode and cathode. The first layer, neighboring to the electrolyte layer, was composed of BSCF (70 wt.%) + SDC (30 wt.%) with the thickness of \u223c20 \u03bcm, which was deposited onto the SDC electrolyte surface by the spray-coating method and followed by calcination at 1000 \u00b0C under air for 2 h. It shows that the BSCF + SDC layer bonded strongly to the electrolyte surface after the calcination. The second layer with the thickness of 60\u2013120 \u03bcm, composed of BSCF (49 wt.%) + SDC (21 wt.%) + Ag (30 wt.%), was deposited onto the BSCF + SDC layer by the painting method and followed by heating at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 2 , both the electrode layers are porous and attached to each other well, while the electrolyte is totally densified. The first layer of the electrode functioned mainly as the electro-catalyst for oxygen reduction (cathode) or oxygen ion oxidation (anode). As shown in Fig. 3 , the electrical conductivity of BSCF reached a maximum of \u223c40 S cm \u22121 under air and \u223c60 S cm \u22121 under oxygen, which was not sufficient for effective current distribution. Therefore, the second layer acted as the current distributor, which is critical for the homogeneous distribution of the current along the electrode surface. The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns of the successive layers are shown in Fig. 4 . No significant reaction between BSCF and SDC after the calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h under air was observed both for the first and second layers. The first layer is composed mainly of the physically mixed phases of BSCF and SDC and the second layer of BSCF, SDC and Ag. Symmetric cell was then built and investigated for cathode/anode performance test and typical impedance spectra for the cell with a two-electrode configuration measured at 650 and 700 \u00b0C under open-circuit conditions are given in Fig. 5 . The impedance spectra are evaluated by fitting the impedance spectra to an equivalent circuit with a configuration of LR ohm ( RQ ) HF ( RQ ) LF , where R ohm is the overall ohmic resistances including the electrolyte resistance, electrode ohmic resistance and lead resistance. L is the inductance, which could be due to the Ag current/voltage probes or the high frequency phase shift of electrochemical equipment. R is a resistance, Q a constant phase element, and the subscripts represent the respective high- and low-frequency contribution. The difference between realaxes intercepts of the impedance plot is considered to be the electrode polarization resistance ( R p ). As can be seen, very low electrode area specific resistance (ASR), only 0.0479 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 \u00b0C and 0.0203 \u03a9 cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C, was observed. To check the reproducibility of the electrode performance, the electrode ASRs were measured on three nominally identical prepared samples and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . Both the electrode resistances and the activation energy were very similar for the three samples, which indicated the reproducibility for the performance of the composite electrodes was very well. For instance the electrode ASRs were 0.0058, 0.0059 and 0.0068 \u03a9 cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C, whose relative standard deviation was only 8.9%. It suggests that the dual layered electrode could be potentially applied as the cathode for the electrochemical oxygen generator cell. Perovskite oxide is usually applied as the cathode material for SOFCs. Recently some perovskite oxides also find promising application as anode materials for SOFCs with super carbon-coking resistance capability. The cobalt-based perovskites are highly electrochemically active for the oxygen reduction and its performance as cathode material has been well recognized. However, due to the easily reduction of cobalt ion under reduced atmosphere, their application as the anode in SOFCs is limited. For the electrochemical oxygen generator cell, the anode atmosphere is also highly oxidized (pure oxygen or diluted oxygen). The ASR of composite electrode was only \u223c0.002 \u03a9 cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C under the oxygen atmosphere. Therefore, the BSCF based electrode is also suitable for being operated as the anode for the electrochemical oxygen generator cell. The exciting good electrode performance was achieved by using this double-layered composite electrode, and these results, as far as we know, are much better than the ASRs results of BSCF and BSCF + SDC reported in Refs. [9\u201313] . It is worthy of noting that the Ag particles in the second layer played an important roll in improvement of cathode performance, which are not served as the current collector only. First of all, partial melting and volatilization of Ag is expected in the course of sintering. Second, oxygen incorporation into Ag under both anodic and cathodic conditions leads to the formation of Ag\u2013O solutions with low melting points. These factors may both lead to Ag penetration into the first electrode layer and to presence of direct contact between SDC and Ag particles. It is well known that Ag can absorb O 2 on its surface and let them dissolve into it. The concentration of O ad (adsorbed species of oxygen) on the Ag surface may be larger than that on the BSCF surface. In addition, Ag particles can improve the electron supply through a porous structure. For aforementioned reasons, Ag has been introduced to improve the cathode performance for SOFCs successfully [17\u201319] . As a result, the double-layered composite electrode performance for electrochemical oxygen generator cell was also improved strongly in this study. A cell with the SDC electrolyte thickness of 0.4 mm and identical double-layered composite electrodes both for cathode and anode was then fabricated and sealed on the top of the quartz tube with a silver paste. A constant current was introduced across the anode and cathode of the electrochemical oxygen generator cell. A simultaneous oxygen product flux through the membrane from the cathode to the anode was detected. The current density was varied from 0 to 4.63 A cm \u22122 at the investigated temperature of 600\u2013800 \u00b0C. Fig. 7 shows the current density dependence of the oxygen product flux at 800 \u00b0C and the corresponding voltage between cathode and anode. The measured oxygen product flux complied with the theoretical values well, which indicated the absence of leakage of gas for the measuring equipment during the test. The actual temperatures of the cell were detected by attaching a thermocouple to the cell. As can be seen, they were higher than 800 \u00b0C under different current passage and reached as high as 880 \u00b0C at a current density of 4.63 A cm \u22122 . The elevated temperature promoted the oxygen ion conductivity of electrodes and SDC electrolyte, hence dropped down their resistance, thus the voltage did not increase linearly with the current. Long-term stability of oxygen generator cell with composite electrodes was operated at 700 \u00b0C under a current density of 2.34 A cm \u22122 . Fig. 8 illustrates the electrochemical performance for oxygen generator cell over more than 900 min. The Faradic efficiency reached about 100% within the experimental error. The performance of the oxygen generator cell based on the composite electrode was found to be very stable during the investigation. A stable ASR of approximately 0.0122 \u03a9 cm 2 was evident, which was much smaller than the value obtained at OCV condition at the same temperature. Fig. 9 shows the electrode ASR under the different current passage at 700 \u00b0C. With the increase of the applied current, the area specific resistance decreased obviously. At an applied current density of 2.34 A cm \u22122 the electrode resistance dropped to half of the value at zero current density. The increase of the electrode performance could be originated from the increase of the cell temperature induced by current consumption and the increase of the oxygen vacancy concentration in the electrode under current passage. The increase of the electrode performance due to the decrease of the electrode resistance with the increase of current passage is beneficial for the reduction in power consumption for oxygen generation. However, the increase of current passage by itself increased the power consumption per liter of oxygen generated since the power consumption proportional to square of current ( I ) while the oxygen generated proportional to I . Therefore, lower current density would be more beneficial for the decrease of power consumption for generating per liter of oxygen. Table 1 lists the ratio of electrolyte resistance to the total resistance under the open circuit voltage (OCV) condition. It was found that more than 95% of the electrical resistance of the permeation cell was contributed from the electrolyte layer. It suggests that a decrease of the electrolyte thickness would result in the sharp decrease of the power consumption. Therefore, the thin film technique would be beneficial to the commercialization of the solid electrolyte ITM based oxygen generator. 4 Conclusion A double-layer composite electrode based on BSCF + SDC and BSCF + SDC + Ag was reported to be a promising cathode and also anode for the electrochemical oxygen generator based on samaria doped ceria electrolyte. It was found that the Ag particles in second layer had a positive effect on the improvement of electrode performance. Electrode polarization resistance, as low as 0.0058 \u03a9 cm 2 was reached at 800 \u00b0C under air. The oxygen generator cell was working for more than 900 min with the Faradic efficiency of around 100% and a stable electrode ASR of 0.0122 \u03a9 cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C.

The surface-exchange and bulk-diffusion properties, phase reaction with the electrolyte, electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction, and performance in the real fuel cell condition of SCN and BSCN electrodes are comparatively studied by conductivity relaxation, XRD, EIS and I\u2013V polarization characterizations. Much better performance is found for BSCN than SCN. Furthermore, water has a positive effect on oxygen reduction over BSCN while it has the opposite effect with SCN. A peak power density of 630 mW cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C is achieved for a thin-film BZCY electrolyte cell with a BSCN cathode compared to only 287 mW cm \u22122 for a similar cell with an SCN cathode. The results highly recommend BSCN as a potential cathode material for protonic SOFCs. Keywords Proton Perovskite Cathode Solid-oxide fuel cells 1 Introduction With the growing concerns regarding increasing greenhouse-gas emissions and ever diminishing fuel reserves, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have received considerable attention recently for their high efficiency and low emissions. Currently, particular research efforts have been paid to reducing the operating temperature of SOFCs to the intermediate-to-low temperature range of 400\u2013650 \u00b0C for the many benefits derived from such a reduction [1] . Because state-of-the-art stabilized zirconia electrolytes have insufficient conductivity at such low operating temperatures, the development of new electrolyte becomes a necessity. Several proton-conducting oxides were found to have attractive ionic conductivity at reduced temperature, which may be even higher than the well-known doped ceria at temperatures lower than 600 \u00b0C [2\u20134] . Among these, BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3 (BZCY) possesses simultaneously high conductivity and chemical stability [3] . The electrode activity is another major concern in the development of intermediate-to-low temperature SOFCs, as electrode polarization resistance usually overwhelms ohmic resistance for an SOFC with a thin-film electrolyte. During the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop innovative low temperature cathodes. Several promising cathode materials have been developed for oxygen-ionic SOFCs [5\u20137] . For example, perovskite-type SrCo 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SCN) oxide is a highly efficient cathode material for oxygen-ionic SOFCs [8] . However, the development of protonic SOFCs has been greatly retarded, with a lack of high performance cathodes to match protonic electrolytes being one of the main reasons. Simply transferring a cathode material that performs well in oxygen-ionic SOFCs to protonic SOFCs is not practicable, as the performance of an electrode is highly dependent on the electrolyte that it is fabricated on. In this study, we report a novel Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.9 Nb 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCN) as a promising cathode material for a protonic SOFC with a BZCY electrolyte. Partial substitution of the Sr in SCN with Ba altered the effect of water on the electrode performance from detrimental to beneficial, alleviated the detrimental effect of interfacial reaction on electrolyte conductivity, and improved oxygen-bulk-diffusion and surface-exchange properties. 2 Experimental BZCY was synthesized by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexation process as described previously [9] . Both SCN and BSCN oxides were synthesized by a mechanoactivation-assisted solid-state reaction. The dense electrolyte for symmetric cell tests was fabricated by dry pressing and sintering at 1450 \u00b0C. The anode-supported dual-layer cells were fabricated by dual dry pressing and co-sintering at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h. The electrodes were fabricated onto the electrolyte surface by spray deposition followed by firing in air at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h, silver paste was used as the current collector. The phase structure of the as-synthesized powders and products from the powder reaction were examined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). For the electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, BSCN and SCN powders were fabricated into bar-shaped pellets by dry pressing followed by sintering at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. The DC conductivity was measured in four-probe configuration. A constant current was supplied to the two current wires and the voltage response was recorded with a Keithley 2420 source meter. For symmetric cell tests, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured under open-circuit voltage (OCV) conditions using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1260A frequency\u2013response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency was varied from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with signal amplitude of 30 mV. For I\u2013V polarization tests, a cell was sealed onto a quartz tube reactor with the cathode side exposed to ambient air while the anode was swept with humidified H 2 (3% H 2 O) at a flow rate of 80 mL min \u22121 (STP). I\u2013V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 digital source meter. The EIS of the cell was also measured under OCV conditions. 3 Results and discussion Previously we demonstrated that SCN performed fairly well for oxygen reduction on a SDC electrolyte [8,10] . However, it was found that the partial substitution of the Sr 2+ in SCN with Ba 2+ resulted in an increase in the oxygen-permeation flux of the corresponding dense membrane at high temperature, with an optimal substitution of 60% [11] . Both oxygen-permeation through a mixed-conducting ceramic membrane and oxygen reduction over a mixed-conducting electrode in SOFCs involve the processes of oxygen-bulk-diffusion and oxygen surface-exchange. D chem and k ex of both BSCN and SCN were then comparatively measured using the electrical conductivity relaxation method. At 650 \u00b0C, the oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere was suddenly changed from air to the atmosphere with oxygen partial pressure of only 0.05 atm., the electrical conductivity relaxation curves were then recorded. For a bar sample with the dimension of 2 l 1 by 2 l 2 cross-section and 2 l 3 length, with the solution of Fick's second law under appropriate initial and boundary conditions, the relative conductivity g ( t ) with time t can be expressed as [12] : (1) g ( t ) = \u03c3 ( t ) \u2212 \u03c3 ( 0 ) \u03c3 ( \u221e ) \u2212 \u03c3 ( 0 ) = 1 \u2212 \u2211 n = 1 \u221e \u2211 m = 1 \u221e \u2211 p = 1 \u221e \u2009\u200a\u200a 2 C 1 2 \u2009\u200a\u200a exp ( \u2212 \u03b1 1 n 2 D chem t / l 1 2 ) \u03b1 1 n 2 ( \u03b1 1 n 2 + C 1 2 + C 1 ) \u00d7 2 C 2 2 \u2009\u200a\u200a exp ( \u2212 \u03b1 2 m 2 D chem t / l 2 2 ) \u03b1 2 m 2 ( \u03b1 2 m 2 + C 2 2 + C 2 ) \u00d7 2 C 3 2 \u2009\u200a\u200a exp ( \u2212 \u03b1 3 p 2 D chem t / l 3 2 ) \u03b1 3 p 2 ( \u03b1 3 p 2 + C 3 2 + C 3 ) where D chem is the chemical-diffusion coefficient, \u03c3 (0), \u03c3 ( t ) and \u03c3 (\u221e) denote the initial, time dependent and final conductivities, respectively. The parameters C 1 , C 2 , C 3 are defined as: (2) C 1 = l 1 L d , \u2003 \u2003 C 2 = l 2 L d , \u2003 \u2003 C 3 = l 3 L d (3) L d = D chem k ex k ex is the chemical surface-exchange coefficient in the relaxation process. The coefficients a 1 n , a 2 m and a 3 p are the n th, m th, p th roots, respectively, of the transcendental equations: (4) C 1 = \u03b1 1 n \u2009\u200a\u200a tan \u2009\u200a\u200a \u03b1 1 n , \u2003 \u2003 C 2 = \u03b1 2 m \u2009\u200a\u200a tan \u2009\u200a\u200a \u03b1 2 m , \u2003 \u2003 C 3 = \u03b1 3 p \u2009\u200a\u200a tan \u2009\u200a\u200a \u03b1 3 p D chem and k ex values were then obtained by fitting the experimental data to Eq. (1) . They are 9.06 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 s \u22121 and 2.07 \u00d7 10 \u22123 cm s \u22121 for BSCN, respectively, while the corresponding values for SCN electrode were found to be 1.84 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm 2 s \u22121 and 5.68 \u00d7 10 \u22124 cm s \u22121 , respectively. It indicates BSCN had both higher surface-exchange and higher chemical-diffusion properties than SCN. In practical application, the electrode performance is also closely related to the interfacial properties. In fabricating an electrode onto an electrolyte surface, a high-temperature firing procedure is needed, which may induce an interfacial phase reaction between the two layers. The potential phase reaction between BSCN/SCN electrodes and the BZCY electrolyte was investigated by powder reaction. BSCN or SCN was mixed thoroughly with BZCY in powder form and then calcined at 1000 or 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. As shown in Fig. 1 , after the calcination, the diffraction peaks of both BSCN and SCN phases shifted to a lower angle while BZCY shifted to a higher angle. This suggests that both BSCN and SCN reacted with BZCY during the high-temperature calcination. The reaction likely involved a cation exchange between BSCN/SCN and BZCY resulting in a lattice expansion of the BSCN/SCN phases and the lattice shrinkage of the BZCY phase. The effects of phase reaction on the electrode and electrolyte performances were investigated by EIS in a symmetric cell configuration. Shown in Fig. 2 are the typical impedance spectra of BSCN (a) and SCN (b) electrodes in Nyquist plots for symmetric cells with an electrolyte thickness of 0.65 mm. The high frequency intercept of the impedance spectrum with the real axis gives the approximate ohmic resistance of the cell ( R ohm ), while the low-frequency intercept gives the sum of the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and the total polarization resistance of the two symmetric electrodes ( R ohm + R p ). The difference between intercept of the impedance spectrum with the real axis at the high frequency and the low frequency can be roughly treated as the electrode polarization resistance (here, the values have been divided by two). The results indicated that the cell with SCN electrodes had a much larger ohmic resistance than with BSCN. In dry air at 650 \u00b0C, the resistances were \u223c4.0 and \u223c12.0 \u03a9 cm 2 for the cells with BSCN and SCN electrodes, respectively. Such a large difference is clearly related to the phase reaction between the electrode and the electrolyte. In other words, the phase reaction between BSCN and BZCY had much less effect on the ionic conductivity of the BZCY electrolyte than that between SCN and BZCY. The BSCN electrode also showed a smaller polarization resistance (\u223c0.4 \u03a9 cm 2 ) than SCN (\u223c1.2 \u03a9 cm 2 ) at 650 \u00b0C, which can be attributed in part to the better surface-exchange and chemical-diffusion properties of BSCN versus SCN. An important difference from an oxygen-ionic SOFC is that water in a protonic SOFC is produced at the cathode side. The effect of water on cathode performance is therefore of great concern in protonic SOFCs. To evaluate this effect, the symmetric cells were also operated in a 3%-H 2 O-humidified air atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 2 , a modest reduction in electrolyte ohmic resistance was observed compared to that measured in dry air. Actually, the contribution of p-type electronic conduction may decrease and proton conduction will appear while water vapor is introduced to dry air for Ba x Ce 0.9 Y 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 1.05, 0.95) [13] , in this case, it seemed that the introduced proton conductivity is larger than the decreased p-type electronic conductivity for the bulk of the electrolyte in the symmetric cells. However, a very different effect on the electrode performance was observed for the BSCN and SCN electrodes. The R p for BSCN decreased from 0.44 \u03a9 cm 2 in dry air to 0.27 \u03a9 cm 2 with the introduction of water vapor at 650 \u00b0C, while the R p of SCN increased substantially, from 1.22 \u03a9 cm 2 in dry air to 2.23 \u03a9 cm 2 in humidified air. This further demonstrates that BSCN is far superior to SCN as a cathode in protonic SOFCs. To determine its performance in real fuel cell conditions, complete cells with BSCN cathodes were fabricated. Shown in Fig. 3 a are the I\u2013V curves of the cells with BSCN cathodes and thin-film BZCY electrolytes (\u223c30 \u03bcm), and, for comparison, the results of similar cells with SCN cathodes. The cells with BSCN cathodes showed a relatively high performance of 630 mW cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C, which is among the highest performance of protonic SOFCs reported in the available literature, for example, a peak power density of 725 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 700 \u00b0C by Yang et al. [14] with a composite cathode of BZCY and Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SSC). Very recently, a peak power density of 665 mW cm \u22122 at 700 \u00b0C was also reported by Sun et al. [15] using a composite cathode of SSC and SDC. It implies that the formation of composite cathode of BSCN and BZCY or SDC may further increase the electrode performance of BSCN cathode. However, the cells with SCN as the cathode showed a peak power density of only 287 mW cm \u22122 under similar conditions. As both cells had a similar OCV of \u223c1.0 V at 700 \u00b0C, the major difference of the single-cell performance was likely due to their different cell resistances. Shown in Fig. 3 b are the corresponding impedance spectra of the cells with BSCN cathodes under OCV conditions, and, for comparison, the impedance spectra of the corresponding SCN cells at 700 \u00b0C. The intercept with real axis at high frequency represents the electrolyte resistance ( R s ) of cell and the other intercept at low frequency corresponds to the total resistance ( R t ) of cell. Thus, the interfacial resistance ( R p ) of cell was considered as the difference between R t and R s . The R p values of the cells with BSCN cathodes were 0.06, 0.23 and 0.57 \u03a9 cm 2 , respectively, at 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C, these results were also compared with several literature reports, for example, the polarization resistances of cells with BZCY\u2013LSCF cathode are estimated to be about 0.19, 0.47, 1.34 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650, 600, and 550 \u00b0C, respectively [16] , a cell polarization resistance of 0.08 and 0.8 \u03a9 cm \u22122 were observed at 700 and 600 \u00b0C with a single SmBa 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathode [17] . The cells with SCN cathodes suffered from much larger R s and R p than similar cells with BSCN cathodes. Fig. 4 shows the SEM photo of the cell with BSCN cathode after the I\u2013V polarization test from across-sectional view. It is worth pointing out that the I\u2013V curves are almost linear implying that there are a little activation loss and concentration polarization loss mainly related to the high catalytic activity of BSCN cathode and sufficient porosity of Ni-BZCY anode. After the fuel cell test, the cathode still adhered to the electrolyte surface without evidence for delimitation. This suggests that the BSCN cathode matched the BZCY electrolyte well during the test. 4 Conclusions BSCN had improved surface-exchange and bulk-chemical-diffusion properties over SCN. Although there were phase reactions, likely involving cation exchange, of both the BSCN and the SCN electrodes with the BZCY electrolyte at high temperature, the effects on electrolyte conductivity were much less with BSCN than with SCN. As a result, symmetric cells with BSCN cathodes showed both smaller cell ohmic resistance and electrode polarization resistance than similar cells with SCN electrodes. The positive effect of water on the oxygen reduction over BSCN electrodes is another significant advantage of BSCN over SCN as a cathode in a protonic SOFC. As a result, much higher cell performance was observed for the cells with BSCN electrodes than with SCN electrodes. A peak power density of 630 mW cm \u22122 and an electrode polarization resistance of 0.06 \u03a9 cm 2 were achieved for a cell with a BSCN electrode at 700 \u00b0C. These results indicate that BSCN is a highly promising cathode material for protonic SOFCs.

        "abstract": "A no-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell operated on a fuel-rich ethanol flame was reported. Heat produced from the combustion of ethanol thermally sustained the fuel cell at a temperature of 500\u2013830 \u00b0C. Considerable amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were also produced during the fuel-rich combustion which provided the direct fuels for the fuel cell. The location of the fuel cell with respect to the flame was found to have a significant effect on the fuel cell temperature and performance. The highest power density was achieved when the anode was exposed to the inner flame. By modifying the Ni + Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) anode with a thin Ru/SDC catalytic layer, the fuel cell envisaged not only an increase of the peak power density to \u223c200 mW cm \u22122 but also a significant improvement of the anodic coking resistance. Keywords Flame fuel cell Solid-oxide fuel cell Ethanol Ruthenium Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 1 Introduction Fuel cells represent one of the cleanest, most efficient and most versatile technologies for chemical-to-electrical energy conversion [1] . Among the many types of fuel cells, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have received considerable attention due to their high efficiency and fuel flexibility [2,3] . Conventional SOFCs are operated in a dual-chamber configuration ( Fig. 1 a ), in which the cell is separated into two compartments with the help of sealant, with the anode chamber supplied with fuel and the cathode chamber with air. The dual-chamber SOFC does not require catalytically selective electrodes, since the electrodes are exposed to separate gas streams, and is generally considered to be the technology of choice for large-scale stationary power generation. However, normally the dual-chamber configuration is not considered suitable for portable applications in which frequent and rapid start-up and shut-down are necessary, due to large internal stress during the heating and cooling processes resulting from the thermal expansion mismatch between cell components and sealant. More recently, the concept of a single-chamber solid-oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) has been proposed ( Fig. 1 b) [4\u201310] . It is a sealant-free configuration, with both electrodes exposed to the same premixed fuel\u2013air mixture. The performance of the SC-SOFC depends on different catalytic selectivity of the anode and the cathode towards the fuel\u2013oxidant mixture. Therefore, the anode and cathode materials must be carefully designed. Very recently, the innovative concept of a direct-flame fuel cell, operated without a gas chamber, has also been proposed ( Fig. 1 c) [11,12] . Compared to the SC-SOFC, the flame fuel cell configuration is even simpler. The fuel-rich flame provides not only the fuel, but also the heat for thermally sustaining the fuel cell, with the result that external thermal management is unnecessary. The advantages of the direct-flame fuel cell include ultra-simple cell configuration and highly flexible fuel selection, since the structure of a fuel-rich flame is similar for all kinds of hydrocarbon fuels. Furthermore, as with the SC-SOFC, the direct-flame fuel cell is capable of rapid start-up and ideal for portable applications. However, the performance of the direct-flame fuel cell is still relatively poor [11,12] , which hinders its practical applications. On the other hand, ethanol is an ideal fuel, which is a nontoxic, renewable and easily reachable resource with high energy density and in liquid state at normal conditions. The application of ethanol as a fuel for fuel cell has attracted increasing attention recently [13\u201318] . The direct ethanol fuel cell based on low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been exploited in the past years [13\u201316] . In this paper, we report a coking-free flame fuel cell with improved anode by applying ethanol as fuel that doubled the performance as compared with ethanol fuel cell based on PEMFC. It may find potential applications in portable power generation. 2 Experimental An electrolyte-supported fuel cell was used in this study. Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) was employed as the electrolyte material, which was prepared by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [19] . Disk-shaped membranes with a diameter of 15 mm were prepared by dry pressing and sintered at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. Anode powder composed of NiO + SDC (60:40 w/w) was spray-deposited onto one central surface of the sintered electrolyte membrane with a rectangular shape and effective geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 , followed by sintering at the same temperature for 5 h in air. The opposite surface of the membrane was symmetrically spray-deposited with a thin layer of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) + SDC (70:30 w/w) composite and sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. For some fuel cells, the anode surface was further screen-printed with a layer of Ru/SDC (8 wt.%) catalyst and fired at 800 \u00b0C in air. Table 1 shows the detailed fuel cell compositions and processing parameters. The surface morphologies of the fuel cells were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanra-2000). Shown in Fig. 2 are the typical cross-sectional morphologies of the cell. An ethanol lamp was applied to provide the flame for the fuel cells. Fig. 3 shows a schematic of the fuel cell reactor. Here, 99.97% ethanol was used as the fuel, with a density of 0.79 g m \u22123 (20 \u00b0C). The burning rate of the ethanol flame was kept constant at 0.19 g min \u22121 . The fuel cell was located above the flame with the anode facing the flamefront and the cathode exposed to ambient air. Silver paste and silver wires were used as the current collector to minimize possible catalytic activity for ethanol reforming. A K-type thermocouple, penetrating into the flame or attached to the fuel cell surface, was used for measuring the apparent temperature inside the flame or fuel cell temperature. The fuel cell performance was tested by I \u2013 V characterization using a digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2420) interfaced with a computer for data acquisition. The flame gases were sampled via a micro-tube for in situ composition analysis by a mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC 20). The sampling rate was so small that it had negligible effect on the flame shape and composition. The mass spectrometer was pumped to a pressure of \u22481 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Torr using a turbomolecular pump. Water and ethanol were removed from the products before they reached the mass spectrometer in order to avoid poisoning. The micro-tube first sampled the ambient air for about 400 s before it quickly penetrated into the flame for flame composition analysis. The peak at the mass-to-charge ratio of 2 in the mass spectrum was selected for detection of H 2 . Although water and ethanol could also produce H 2 + fragments, their contributions were negligible since they were removed before the gases entered the sampling tube. The peak at m / z of 44 was selected for the detection of CO 2 . As to CO, since N 2 and CO have the same molecule weight of 28 and CO 2 could also produce a CO + fragment, we cannot simply take the peak at m / z of 28 to measure CO. In order to get the CO content from the peak at m / z of 28 ( C det ), the contributions from N 2 and CO 2 must be subtracted. We know that the peak at m / z of 14 contributed from the characteristic fragment of N 2 , i.e., N + , which has a fixed relative intensity of 7.2% to that of N 2 + at m / z of 28 for a pure N 2 gas. On the other hand, the peak intensity of CO + from the cleaving of CO 2 is 11.4% that of CO 2 + at m / z of 44 for a pure CO 2 gas. The CO content ( C CO ) was then calculated as follows (1) C CO = C det \u2212 C N 2 \u2212 0.114 C C O 2 (2) C N 2 = 100 \u00d7 C N 7.2 where C N is the detection content of N at m / z of 14, and C C O 2 is the detection content of CO 2 at m / z of 44, in mass spectroscopy, respectively. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 4 a , the ethanol flame is characterized by a three-layer structure with distinguished layer colors [20] . Across the flame from the center to outside, the layers are named as central flame, inner flame and outer flame, respectively. Different from the premixed fuel-air flame, the ethanol flame investigated here was created by an inter-diffusion of ethanol and oxygen. During the combustion, ethanol continuously diffused from the center of the flame to ambient atmosphere while oxygen diffused in the reverse direction. Positioning the fuel cell on top of the flame resulted in a change of the flame shape as shown in Fig. 4 b. A thermocouple was applied to probe the apparent temperature inside the flame at different positions with and without the fuel cell disk on top of the flame. It should be mentioned that temperature of a flame with a thermocouple is somewhat difficult, because of catalytic reactions on the thermocouple and to radiation corrections that have to be applied. The true temperatures of the flame gases are probably hundreds of degrees hotter. As shown in Fig. 5 , the flame temperature reached 500\u2013830 \u00b0C, depending on the position in the flame. An increase in the temperature was observed across the flame from the center to the outside. Positioning the fuel cell on top of the flame resulted in a decrease of the temperature of about 10\u201330 \u00b0C. Such a decrease is easy to understand since the fuel cell increased the heat loss from surface radiation and also presents a physical barrier for oxygen diffusion. Interestingly, such a fuel cell temperature range was just ideal for operating the doped-ceria based electrolyte. Long-term stability test demonstrated that the cell temperature was stable if the ethanol combustion rate kept constant and there was no environmental disturbance, which suggests that the ethanol flame can be applied efficiently as a heater for thermally sustaining the fuel cell, which then omits the requirement for external thermal management and greatly simplifies the fuel cell system. Ethanol by itself can serve as a direct fuel for an SOFC; however, its partial oxidation products of syngas (CO + H 2 ) are far more active electrochemically. Another advantage of syngas over ethanol as a fuel is that the fuel cell anode is expected to be much less prone to carbon coking. Therefore ethanol reforming products are preferred as the fuels for SOFC. It is well known that the flame can work as a fuel reformer, and the approach of using fuel-rich flames for the production of synthesis gas via partial oxidation has been demonstrated by several authors, in particular with the help of porous combustors [21\u201323] . It was reported that the reaction products of a fuel-rich pre-mixed hydrocarbon flame consist of mainly N 2 , CO 2 , H 2 O, CO and H 2 [24] . This is believed to be true for all kind of hydrocarbons including gaseous, liquid and solid fuels [12] . In this study, the inner and central flames of the ethanol flame could be considered as a fuel-rich flame with an increasing fuel-to-oxygen ratio across the flame from outside to center, and are therefore especially suitable for operating flame fuel cells. In order to assess the nature of the fuel species available for the SOFC of the ethanol flame, the ethanol flame was sampled by a micro-quartz tube probe connected to a mass spectrometer, where the flame composition was analyzed. Fig. 6 shows the gas composition at positions about 1 cm (central flame), 2.4 cm (inner flame) and 4.0 cm (outer flame) away from the center of the flame, respectively. \u201cAir zone\u201d and \u201cflame zone\u201d mean the zones at which mass spectrometer was sampling the air and the flame, respectively. The transitioning zone means the region in which the gas probed by the mass spectrometer changes from air to flame products. It clearly demonstrated there was a considerable amount of H 2 and CO produced within the flame at steady state. Therefore, the fuel-rich ethanol flame worked well as a fuel reformer in this study. Our measurement showed that the deeper into of the flame, the higher the H 2 concentration and the lower the CO 2 concentration, which can be explained by the increasing fuel-to-oxygen ratio across the flame. During the ethanol combustion process many reactions are possible, including: (3) C H 3 C H 2 OH + 3 O 2 \u2192 3 H 2 O + 2 C O 2 \u2003 \u2003 ( \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = \u2212 1365.5 \u2009 kJ \u2009 mo l \u2212 1 ) (4) C H 3 C H 2 OH + H 2 O \u2192 4 H 2 O + 2 CO \u2003 \u2003 ( \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = \u2212 256.8 \u2009 kJ \u2009 mo l \u2212 1 ) (5) C H 3 C H 2 OH + 1 2 O 2 \u2192 3 H 2 + 2 CO \u2003 \u2003 ( \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = \u2212 14.1 \u2009 kJ \u2009 mo l \u2212 1 ) (6) C H 3 C H 2 OH + 2 H 2 O + 1 2 O 2 \u2192 5 H 2 + 2 C O 2 \u2003 \u2003 ( \u0394 H 298 \u00b0 = \u2212 68.5 \u2009 kJ \u2009 mo l \u2212 1 ) Deep oxidation of ethanol (Eq. (3) ) produces a huge amount of heat, which accounts for the highest temperature of the outer flame where the oxygen concentration is the highest. Under fuel-rich condition, the combustion would be in favor of reactions (4)\u2013(6) , and consequently much more hydrogen is produced. A decrease in flame temperature could also be expected because of the reduction in heat release. Once the SOFC was positioned over the ethanol flame with the anode facing the flame front, a positive open circuit voltage (OCV) was established in seconds while the fuel cell performance reached steady state in minutes. Fig. 7 shows the I \u2013 V curves of the fuel cells (stable performance) without and with the catalytic layer on top of the anode. For both cases, the OCVs experienced an increase with the fuel cell moving downwards from the outer flame to the central flame. An OCV of 0.65, 0.70 and 0.75 V was observed ( Fig. 7 (a)) for the fuel cell located over the outer, inner and central flames, respectively. Based on the results in Figs. 4 and 5 , the increase in OCV should be mainly attributed to both the decrease in fuel cell temperature and the increase in fuel concentration over the anode side. At higher temperatures, the electronic conductivity of the SDC electrolyte becomes more significant, which results in the internal electronic shorting of the doped ceria electrolyte and consequently in a decreasing OCV. The maximum OCV (\u223c0.75 V) observed in the current flame fuel cell was slightly higher than that obtainable in an SC-SOFC employing the same fuel cell components [5,6] . In the flame fuel cell, the cathode actually breathes the air, which ensures a higher oxygen partial pressure at the cathode than that in the SC-SOFC. In this sense, the flame fuel cell can be considered as a kind of internal reforming dual-chamber SOFC. A peak power density of 45, 105 and 63 mW cm \u22122 was obtained for the fuel cell without the catalytic layer and with the anode facing the central, inner and outer flames, respectively. They are comparable to the results reported by other groups with methane-based flame-powered fuel cells [11,12] . Although the central flame had the highest concentration of hydrogen as shown in Fig. 6 , it also had the lowest fuel cell temperature. The low cell temperature significantly reduced the electrode activity and increased the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte. On the other hand, the outer flame had the highest fuel cell temperature, but the hydrogen concentration was low due to the presence of a large amount of oxygen. Comparatively, the inner flame demonstrated the highest fuel cell performance since it had both an appropriate temperature and a favorable gas composition. The OCV was only slightly improved when the anode surface was deposited with a thin catalytic layer. A value of 0.66, 0.71 and 0.77 V was obtained for the cases of outer, inner and central flames, respectively ( Fig. 7 (b)), which was only 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01 V higher than the case without the catalytic layer. However, the catalytic layer greatly enhanced the fuel cell performance, evidenced by a peak power density of 60, 200 and 130 mW cm \u22122 corresponding to the central, inner and outer flames, respectively. The significant improvement in performance could be due to the catalytic activity of the Ru/SDC catalytic layer towards ethanol reformation and partial oxidation. It is well known that the Ru/CeO 2 -based catalysts have superior catalytic activities for hydrocarbon partial oxidation and reforming [25\u201327] . The deposition of the Ru/CeO 2 -based catalyst over the anode might then promote the reactions (3)\u2013(6) . Kinetically, there should be a considerable amount of unreacted ethanol reaching the anode during the fuel cell operation after combustion. The Ru/SDC catalytic layer heterogeneously catalyzed the ethanol to syngas (CO + H 2 ) over the anode surface by reforming ethanol with the CO 2 and H 2 O formed in situ or by partially oxidizing ethanol with the oxygen diffusing in from the ambient atmosphere. Due to the enhanced production of syngas, which is much more active electrochemically than ethanol, an increase in fuel cell performance should be expected. By comparison with the SOFC in this study, the direct ethanol fuel cell based on polymer electrolyte membrane has also received increased attention due to the nontoxic and renewable characteristics of ethanol. However, up to now, its peak power density has been typically lower than 100 mW cm 2 [13\u201316] . Our data shows that the direct-flame SOFC in this study delivers a much better performance. Despite the remarkable improvement in power density, coking remains a problem for the flame fuel cell in some cases. After an operation for more than 10 h, the anode was examined by SEM. Fig. 8 shows the SEM morphologies of the anode surface without and with the catalytic layer. Serious coking was observed over the fuel cell anode with bare Ni + SDC, which could be explained by the well-known fact that nickel catalyst promotes hydrocarbon cracking [28] . When Ru/SDC catalytic layer was applied however, the anode demonstrated no carbon deposition after the fuel cell test. This indicates that Ru/SDC greatly improved the coking resistance of the anode, and similar super coking resistant properties of the Ru/CeO 2 -based catalytic layer have also been reported in literatures [29\u201331] . So we believe that this improved carbon-coking resistance of the anode is closely related to the capability of the ruthenium catalyst to promote the elimination of the carbon coking by the following reaction: (7) C + H 2 O \u2192 CO + H 2 4 Conclusions The ethanol flame, which serves as a fuel reformer while at the same time providing the required heat for the fuel cell operation, was found to be an ideal power source for the flame fuel cells based on the SDC electrolyte. It was found that the fuel cell temperature and performance strongly depended on the location of the fuel cell with respect to the flame, and the performance decreased in the order of inner, outer and central flames for fuel cells both with and without the catalytic layer. A maximum power density of 200 mW cm \u22122 was achieved with the catalytic-layer-deposited anode exposed to the inner flame. The functional catalytic layer demonstrated beneficial effects on improving both the performance and the coking resistance of the fuel cell. Considering the high-performance and the ultra-simple configuration, the direct ethanol flame fuel cell reported here may have the potential for applications in portable power generation in future. However, a few challenges remain for this type of fuel cells and need to be addressed by future research. (1) Thermal management. The uneven heating of the flame will induce the thermal stress within the fuel cell and may cause it to crack. (2) Fuel utilization. Most of the fuel is consumed by combustion and therefore the total electrical efficiency is low. (3) System design. Flames in real situations are generally hard to control and may often be unstable. Despite these challenges, flame fuel cells could find their potential applications in scenarios where the need for portable power generation overrides the requirement for high fuel utilization, and/or where heat and electricity co-generation is desired.

        "abstract": "We propose a new way to develop high-performance cathodes for IT-SOFCs by utilizing the interfacial reactions. SrCoO x was selected as the starting electrode material, which took a vacancy-ordered 2H BaNiO 3 -type structure and showed negligible ionic conductivity and low electrical conductivity. Phase reactions between SrCoO x and Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 happened at 900 \u00b0C or higher, resulting in the incorporation of Sm and Ce into its lattice structure. This promoted the phase transition to a cubic perovskite and led to substantial increase in the electrical conductivity and oxygen mobility of the electrode. By utilizing such phase reactions, the SrCoO x + Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 composite was developed into a high performance electrode with a low area specific resistance of 0.08 \u03a9 cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C. An anode-supported cell with such electrode delivered a peak power density of 795 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Cathode SrCoO x Interfacial reaction 1 Introduction Intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) have received considerable attention recently because of their high energy efficiency, low emissions and fuel flexibility. Development of new high-performance cathodes is urgently needed in formulating the IT-SOFCs technology. Surface modification with nano-size oxides or precious metals, microstructure optimization, and development of new mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) electrodes are the traditional ways towards improving the cathode performance at reduced temperatures [1,2] . The solid-phase reactions between cell components, especially the interfacial reactions between electrode and electrolyte, have been a practical problem for many SOFC systems. In order to avoid such detrimental reactions, decreasing the fabrication temperature through advanced synthesis techniques or adopting a protecting layer to avoid direct contact of electrode and electrolyte have been frequently adopted [3,4] . In this communication, we report that high-performance cathodes can be developed by properly utilizing the phase reactions between electrolyte and electrode, and between the electrode components during high-temperature firing for fixing the cathode layer. Through reactive sintering, SrCoO x (SC) with negligible ionic conductivity and poor electronic conductivity was successfully developed into a high-performance cathode. By optimizing the SC to Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) weight ratio, an anode-supported cell with SC + SDC cathode delivered a peak power density of 1000 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C operating on hydrogen fuel. 2 Experimental All oxide powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process [5] . For fabricating symmetric cells, the SDC powder was pressed into disk-shaped pellets followed by sintered at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. To prepare the electrode layers, SC + SDC mixture (well dispersed in a mixed solution of ethylene glycol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) was symmetrically deposited onto both surfaces of the electrolytes by spray, followed by calcination at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. To fabricate the thin-film electrolyte single cell, the NiO + SDC (60\u201340 by wt%) supported thin-film SDC electrolyte dual-layer cells were prepared by dual dry pressing, followed by sintering at 1450 \u00b0C in air for 5 h to densify the electrolyte layer. The cathode slurry was then deposited onto the electrolyte surface by spray deposition and then fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h. The as-obtained cells have an anode thickness around 0.6 mm, electrolyte thickness around 20 \u03bcm, and cathode thickness around 60\u201380 \u03bcm. Phase structures or compositions of the as-obtained powders were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). Electrical conductivity was measured by using the four-terminal DC technique. Electrode performance was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions, which was conducted using a Solartron 1260A + 1287 electrochemical workstation. The electrode performance was also evaluated in real anode-supported cells. I\u2013V polarization curves were obtained using a Keithley 2420 Sourcemeter. Three percentage water humidified hydrogen was fed into the anode chamber at 80 ml min \u22121 [STP]. Ambient air served as the oxidant gas. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 a shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of SC in air, which can be basically indexed based on a vacancy-ordered 2H BaNiO 3 -type structure. It has been previously reported that SC membrane showed a near-zero permeation flux below 900 \u00b0C attributed to its immobilized oxygen ion [6] . Thereby, SC may perform badly as an IT-SOFC cathode. On the other hand, SC is the parent oxide for many functional composite oxides. By proper doping, the material may develop into a cubic perovskite and show mixed ionic and electronic conductivity that will greatly increase its electrode performance. One important example is Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) perovskite, which showed an area specific resistance (ASR) of only 0.07 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C [7] . Samarium can dope into SC to form Sm x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite [8] . Recently we have demonstrated that cerium can dope into the B-site of SC to efficiently stabilize the cubic perovskite structure [9] . During the high-temperature firing for fabricating the cathode layer, phase reactions between SC and SDC may occur. By properly selecting the firing temperature, such phase reactions may be utilized to design high performance electrode from SC. Fig. 1 b\u2013g shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of 50 wt% SC + 50 wt% SDC mixed powder after the calcination at various temperatures for 5 h in air. When the calcination temperature is 900 \u00b0C ( Fig. 1 c), the peak intensity of the 2H BaNiO 3 phase was reduced while a characteristic peak of perovskite at 2 \u03b8 = 40.7 o appeared. This suggests the phase reaction between SC and SDC happened to a certain degree and resulted in the formation of a new cubic perovskite phase. After the calcination at 950 \u00b0C or higher, the peak intensity of the 2H BaNiO 3 -type phase reduced greatly. The mixture can be better indexed based on a mixture of a cubic perovskite phase and a fluorite phase. To interpret the appearance of the cubic perovskite phase after the calcination, composite oxides with the nominal compositions of Sm 0.05 Sr 0.95 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , Sm 0.1 Sr 0.9 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , SrCo 0.9 Ce 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 and Sm 0.05 Sr 0.95 Co 0.9 Ce 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 were synthesized. Fig. 1 h shows that low concentration of samarium doping in the A-site of SC did not stabilize the cubic structure. Even though half of the Sr was substituted by Sm, the oxide still took an orthorhomic perovskite structure [8] , while only 5% of cobalt in SC was substituted by cerium the cubic structure was efficiently stabilized ( Fig. 1 j). Thereby, the formation of cubic lattice structure was likely caused by the incorporation of cerium into the B-site of SC. As a SOFC cathode, low electrical conductivity may result in a large contact resistance. As shown in Fig. 2 a, SC had relatively low conductivity of 5\u201325 S cm \u22121 between 300 and 900 \u00b0C in air. Fig. 2 b\u2013d shows the electrical conductivity of SC, Sm 0.05 Sr 0.95 Co 0.9 Ce 0.1 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , and SC + SDC composite sintered at 900, 1000 and 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h (corrected by porosity). If no phase reaction occurs between SC and SDC, the electrical conductivity of SC + SDC composite should be lower than pure SC, since SDC is characterized by a low electronic conductivity. SC + SDC composite calcined at 900 \u00b0C showed a maximum conductivity of \u223c182 S cm \u22121 . With increasing calcination temperature the conductivity increased slightly. After the sintering at 1000 \u00b0C, a maximum conductivity of \u223c208 S cm \u22121 was reached, which is about ten times higher than pristine SC. The much higher electrical conductivity of SC + SDC over pure SC is an obvious sign of the phase reaction between SC and SDC. The high electrical conductivity is beneficial for efficient current collecting. It is well-known that introducing ionic conducting phase or path into a pure electronic conducting electrode, such as La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 , can greatly increase the electrode performance because of extension of the active sites for oxygen reduction. The oxygen ionic conductivity ( \u03c3 ave ) of the electrode materials can be roughly calculated from the oxygen permeation fluxes of the corresponding membranes based on the following equation: \u03c3 ave = J O 2 4 2 F 2 L RT ln P O 2 \u2032 P O 2 \u2033 - 1 , where F is the Faraday constant, L is the membrane thickness and J O 2 is the oxygen permeation fluxes. P O 2 \u2032 and P O 2 \u2033 are the oxygen partial pressure at the feed side and sweep side membrane surface atmosphere, respectively. SrCe 0.05 Co 0.95 O 3 membrane showed a permeation flux as high as 1.47 ml cm 2 min \u22121 [STP] at 900 \u00b0C [9] . The calculated ionic conductivity of SrCo 0.95 Ce 0.05 O 1.95 reached 0.13 S cm \u22121 at 700 \u00b0C and 0.59 S cm \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C. A negligible ionic conductivity was calculated between 600 and 900 \u00b0C for the SC membrane because of its negligible oxygen permeability. This indicates that the phase reaction between SC and SDC also improved the ionic conductivity of the electrode. The electrode performance was then evaluated in a symmetric cell configuration. The results are listed in Table 1 . The area specific resistances (ASRs) of pure SC fired at 1000 \u00b0C reached 0.19, 0.51, and 5.47 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650, 600, and 500 \u00b0C, respectively. The relatively good electrode performance of SC can be explained by the interfacial reaction between SC electrode and SDC electrolyte during the calcination, which greatly increased the ionic conductivity around the region near the electrolyte surface. To further increase the activity for oxygen reduction, SDC was introduced into the electrode to form SC + SDC composite. The ASRs of various SC + SDC electrodes with different SC to SDC weight ratios are also listed in Table 1 . As expected, the electrode performance increased by introducing an SDC phase. Even at an SDC content as low as 10 wt%, the ASRs were reduced to only 0.10 and 0.25 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. At the weight ratio of 1:1, the electrode showed the best performance with ASRs of 0.075 and 0.18 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. Two factors could contribute to such obvious improvement in electrode performance. First, the introduction of SDC phase effectively increased the apparent ionic conductivity of the electrode and thereby increased the active sites for oxygen reduction since SDC by itself is an excellent ionic conducting material. Second, the introduction of SDC into the electrode made the solid-phase reactions throughout the entire electrode, which further increased the apparent ionic conductivity of the electrode. Besides, the substantial increase in the electrical conductivity of the electrode because of the formation of the cubic perovskite phase may also improve the current collecting efficiency. The best performance at SC to SDC weight ratio of 1:1 suggested that the reaction product was optimized under such circumstances. The significant improvement in electrode performance of SC-based electrodes through the interfacial reaction was further demonstrated by the single cell test. Ni + SDC anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte (\u223c20 \u03bcm) fuel cells were fabricated. SC + SDC electrodes with different SC to SDC weight ratios were fabricated onto the electrode surface at 1000 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig 3 a are I\u2013V curves of the cells with different cathodes at 600 \u00b0C operating on humidified hydrogen fuel. When pure SC was adopted as the cathode, a peak power density (PPD) of 300 mW cm \u22122 was achieved. Such reaction has been demonstrated by the mixed powder reaction experiment with the results shown in Fig. 1 . It increased progressively with decreasing SC to SDC ratio in the SC + SDC electrode until it reached 1:1. The cell with 50 wt% SC + 50 wt% SDC composite electrode delivered a PPD of 795 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. With the further decrease in SC to SDC ratio, the cell performance decreased. Such trend coincidences well with the electrode performance of SC + SDC composite electrodes by the symmetric cell test. These results suggest that the increased cell performance was likely caused by improved cathode performance. The cell performance with 50 wt% SC + 50 wt% SDC composite electrode at various temperatures was further investigated with the corresponding I\u2013V curves shown in Fig. 3 b. A PPD of \u223c1020 and \u223c295 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 650 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively, which is comparable for a similar cell with BSCF cathode [7] . The corresponding cell impedance at OCV conditions are shown in Fig. 3 c and d. At 650 \u00b0C, the cell ohmic resistance reached about 0.249 \u03a9 cm 2 as a comparison of 0.039 \u03a9 cm 2 for the electrode polarization resistance. Even at 500 \u00b0C the ohmic resistance is still more than 1.5 times that of the electrode polarization resistance. 4 Conclusions Use of the interfacial reaction between electrode and electrolyte or between the electrode components is a practical way to develop high-performance cathodes for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. By properly selecting the starting material, the phase reaction could result in the formation of new materials with high oxygen ionic conductivity and electronic conductivity. The firing temperature and the weight ratio of the starting material to electrolyte material are critical in achieving high electrode performance. Through the phase reaction with SDC, SC, an oxide with negligible ionic conductivity and poor electronic conductivity can develop into a promising electrode with low area specific resistance of only 0.08 \u03a9 cm 2 at 650 \u00b0C.

Oxygen vacancies were created after cathodic polarization for a certain period of time. The generating rate was closely related with oxygen partial pressure of surrounding atmosphere (Po2). polarization time, temperature, and voltage. The in situ created oxygen vacancies could propagate both over the surface and into the bulk of the LSSM electrode after a high cathodic polarization. Both chemical oxidation by ambient air and electrochemical oxidation by anodic polarization were exploited to demonstrate the deactivation mechanism of these in situ created oxygen vacancies. The rate-determining step of oxygen reduction reaction over LSSM electrode before and after the activation was also investigated.

        "abstract": "In order to increase the coking resistance of SOFCs operating on DME fuel, a Pt/Al2O3-Ni/MgO mixture catalyst was investigated for internal partial oxidation of DME. Catalytic test demonstrated the mixture catalyst has higher activity for DME partial oxidation and lower CH4 selectivity than the individual Pt/Al2O3 and Ni/MgO catalysts. O2-TPO analysis demonstrated that the mixture catalyst also had much higher coke resistance than sintered Ni-YSZ anode, especially at high O2 to DME ratio. Raman spectroscopy of the carbon-deposited catalysts demonstrates that the graphitization degree of carbon is reduced with introducing O2 into DME, and the carbon deposited on the mixture catalyst is almost in amorphous structure. Two operation modes of the mixture catalyst for indirect internal partial oxidation of DME, i.e, directly depositing on the anode surface and locating in the anode chamber were tried. The performance of the cells operating on DME fuel through both operation modes was studied by I-V polarization test and EIS characterization. The cells delivered attractive peak power density of around 750 mW cm-2 by operating on DME-O2 mixture gas, modestly lower than 1012-1065 mW cm-2 operating on pure hydrogen fuel at 700 \u00b0C. The direct deposition of Pt/Al2O3-Ni/MgO onto anode surface to perform as a functional layer and a DME to O2 ratio of 2:1 in the mixture gas is preferred to minimize coke formation and maximize power output for the cell to operate on DME fuel.

        "abstract": "Silver-modified Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (Ag/BSCF) electrodes were prepared using an electroless deposition technique. The morphology, microstructure and oxygen reduction reaction activity of the resulted Ag/BSCF electrodes were comparatively studied using Fourier transform infrared spectra, environmental scanning electron microscopy, temperature-programmed oxygen desorption, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An area-specific resistance as low as 0.038 \u03a9 cm 2 was achieved for N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode at 600 \u00b0C. Carbonates were detected over the BSCF surface during the reduction of silver, which deteriorated both the charge-transfer process and diffusion process of HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode for the oxygen electrochemical reduction reaction. An anode-supported single cell with an N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode showed a peak power of 826 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. In comparison, only 672 mW cm \u22122 was observed with the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode. Keywords Ag/Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Cathode Solid-oxide fuel cell Electrochemical impedance Electroless deposition 1 Introduction Advanced low-temperature (<600 \u00b0C) solid-oxide fuel cells (LTSOFCs) require highly functional cathode materials that can provide high ionic and electronic conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) to reduce polarization resistance at the cathode/electrolyte interface at reduced operating temperatures [1\u20135] . Recently, Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) perovskite oxide was successfully developed as a cathode for SOFCs operating at 600 \u00b0C [6,7] . However, low electronic conductivity makes BSCF unfavorable for applications below 600 \u00b0C. Considerable effort has been spent on attempts to increase the electrochemical activity of BSCF at lower temperatures, including the use of doping strategies and surface modifications with metals. It is well known that the introduction of certain precious metals into the porous oxide electrode matrix can enhance electrocatalytic activity for ORR [8\u201315] due to the high activity of precious metals for oxygen reduction as well as the synergetic effect of precious metals and the oxide electrode. Silver is also known to perform a similar function [16\u201324] . Many techniques have been exploited for the synthesis of precious metal- or silver-modified oxide electrodes. Due to its lower cost, the idea of using silver as an electrode modifier has received considerable attention in the past several years. Very recently, an electroless deposition technique has been exploited to prepare silver-modified Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 composite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries [25] and silver-modified BSCF cathode for SOFCs [26,27] . These electrodes showed superior electrochemical performances as compared with those made from the traditional preparation methods, such as mechanical ball milling and impregnation-thermal decomposition. However, it was reported that reducing agents employed during the electroless deposition processes for electrodes designed for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) could have a significant impact on the ORR activity [28] . In our previous study, we also observed that the electrochemical performance of the perovskite-type cathodes, such as BSCF and La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF), was sensitive to the fabricating processes [29,30] . It is thus reasonable to expect that the reducing agents could also have an effect on the performance of silver-modified BSCF cathodes. In order to further improve the electrochemical performance of BSCF-based electrodes, the reducing agent should be optimized. In this study, the reducing agent on the ORR catalytic activity of the silver-modified BSCF was investigated systematically. In particular, hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were adopted as reducing agents. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of the BSCF matrix BSCF powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. The detailed procedure for this process has been reported in our prior publication Ref. [31] . In brief, required amounts of metal nitrates were prepared into a mixed solution followed by the addition of EDTA and citric acid at a pH of \u223c6, with the help of NH 4 OH at a mole ratio of total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid of 1:1:2. The water was evaporated at 90 \u00b0C, resulting in transparent gels which were first pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and then further calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to produce the final products. The prepared BSCF powder was dispersed in a premixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension through the use of a high-energy ball miller (Fritsch, Pulverisettle 6) at a rotational speed of 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The suspension was either symmetrically painted onto both surfaces of a dense SDC pellet with a diameter of \u223c13 mm and a thickness of \u223c0.8 mm, for the impedance test, or painted onto one side of SDC supported by SDC-NiO, for the fuel cell test. The thickness of the SDC thin film was \u223c30 \u03bcm. The BSCF matrix was then fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to make it adhere to the SDC electrolyte surface firmly. 2.2 Preparation of the Ag/BSCF composites The silver precursor (AgNO 3 or Ag(NH 3 ) 2 + ) solution (0.01 mol L \u22121 ) was added in drops (using a suction pipette with an accuracy of \u00b10.01 mL) and soaked into the porous BSCF cathode layer, followed by heating at 80 \u00b0C to evaporate the water. During the preparation, the silver loading was controlled by adjusting the volume of the drops. The weight percentage of Ag to BSCF oxide was fixed at 3 wt.% unless other mentioned. After the impregnation of AgNO 3 into the BSCF matrix, the Ag + was reduced to Ag particles by HCHO or N 2 H 4 . 2.2.1 Electroless deposition by N 2 H 4 When the desired silver loading was reached, the necessary amount of N 2 H 4 solution at 0.01 mol L \u22121 was introduced as a reducing agent to induce the reduction of Ag + to Ag based on the equation: (1) 4AgNO 3 + N 2 H 4 = 4Ag + 4HNO 3 + N 2 . Once the reaction was completed, the cell was heated at 80 \u00b0C over a hotplate, to evaporate the water from the electrode layer, and then fired at 850 \u00b0C for 30 min to form the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode. 2.2.2 Electroless deposition by HCHO Dilute NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O was titrated into the AgNO 3 solution at 0.01 mol L \u22121 until the white deposit disappeared to form the Ag(NH 3 ) 2 + solution. The reactions can be described as follows: (2) Ag + + NH 3 \u21d4 Ag(NH 3 ) + , (3) Ag(NH 3 ) + + NH 3 \u21d4 Ag(NH 3 ) 2 + . The Ag(NH 3 ) 2 + solution was introduced into the BSCF matrix, and the necessary amount of dilute HCHO was added as the reducing agent to induce the reduction of Ag + to Ag based on the equation: (4) 2Ag(NH 3 ) 2 + + HCHO + 2OH \u2212 = 2Ag + HCOO \u2212 + NH 4 + + 3NH 3 + H 2 O. Once the reaction was completed, the cell was heated at 80 \u00b0C over a hotplate, to evaporate the water from the electrode layer, and then fired at 850 \u00b0C for 30 min to form the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode. 2.3 Basic characterization Phase compositions of the composite powders were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) at room temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, AVATAR-360) of the as-prepared powders was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm \u22121 using the KBr pellet method. The oxygen desorption properties of the composite powders were studied using an oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) technique. About 100 mg of the as-prepared powders were loaded in a quartz tube. The assembly was placed in a single-zone furnace equipped with a temperature controller. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min \u22121 (STP). The temperature was increased from 50 to 950 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The effluent gases were monitored by a mass spectrometer (MS, Hiden, QIC-20). The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). 2.4 Electrochemical performance test An electrochemical cell with a four-terminal configuration was constructed. The I \u2013 V polarization was characterized using a Keithley 2420 source meter. Hydrogen, acting as a fuel, was fed into the anode chamber at a flow rate of 80 mL min \u22121 (STP); air, acting as the oxidant gas, was fed into the cathode chamber at a flow rate of 400 mL min \u22121 (STP). Gas flow rates were controlled with mass flow controllers, and a silver paste was used as the current collector. The electrode performance was also investigated by ac impedance spectroscopy using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency range applied was 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions. The overall impedance data were fitted using a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program from the Z-View 2.9b software. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphologies and phase composition Once the AgNO 3 solution was impregnated into the BSCF matrix and dried, the AgNO 3 was crystallized into pyramidal shape particles and dispersed uniformly over BSCF surface as shown in Fig. 1 a . An aqueous solution of N 2 H 4 or HCHO was then added, in drops, to the BSCF + AgNO 3 mixture, which was then heated to 80 \u00b0C to induce the reduction of Ag + to metallic Ag. Zhang et al. reported that when a Pt-Co catalyst was reduced using a 0.1 mol L \u22121 HCHO solution, aggregation was observed due to the strong reducing capability of HCHO [28] . To avoid this problem, a low concentration N 2 H 4 /HCHO solution at 0.01 mol L \u22121 was used in this study. The microscopic morphologies of the as-prepared composite cathodes after the reduction are shown in Fig. 1 b and c. These figures demonstrate that the Ag particles dispersed well without obvious aggregation for the Ag/BSCF electrodes prepared by both reduction processes. However, the morphologies of the Ag particles prepared from the two different reduction processes are very different from each other. The Ag particles prepared by applying N 2 H 4 as a reducing agent showed a cubic shape with a broad particle size distribution from 0.2 to 0.9 \u03bcm, while the Ag prepared via HCHO reduction showed a spherical shape with a uniform particle size of \u223c0.2 \u03bcm. For HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF, besides the Ag particles, additional carbon-enriched by-products were also detected over the BSCF surface by EDX. According to Eq (4) , HCOO \u2212 is released as a by-product accompanying the reduction of Ag + to Ag. Since HCOO \u2212 is unstable in nature, it likely reacted with the BSCF matrix to form the by-products. To learn more about the different reduction processes, the as-prepared composite powders were characterized by FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 2 , the strong sharp adsorption peak at 1385 cm \u22121 was attributed to the vibration band for NO 3 \u2212 , while the peaks at 1636 and 855 cm \u22121 were attributed to the vibration bands of CO 3 2\u2212 . The adsorption peak for NO 3 \u2212 was very weak for the as-prepared N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF, suggesting that the formed HNO 3 likely decomposed into gases. For the as-prepared HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF, carbonate phase was detected. In order to get rid of the organic residues and condition the silver particles, the as-prepared Ag/BSCF composites were submitted for thermal treatment. It has been reported that a firing temperature of 850 \u00b0C is optimal to get the best performance for Ag/BSCF composite cathode prepared by electroless deposition process [27] . Therefore, this temperature was used during the heat treatment of the two cathodes. Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of the two cathodes after the heat treatment at 850 \u00b0C for 30 min. The silvers in both electrodes dispersed well over the BSCF surface and took a spherical morphology with an average silver particle size of \u223c0.5 \u03bcm. In general, the particle size should increase after the heat treatment due to sintering. Interestingly, for the Ag in N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF, the particle size reduced after the heat treatment. It was likely that the silver particles from the N 2 H 4 reduction were in a porous structure, and thus, during the heat treatment, the particles densified, resulting in the observed shrinking. It is well known that the formation of carbonate over the perovskite surface can block oxygen surface diffusion and thereby reduce the electrochemical activity of the oxide for ORR. In order to get rid of such surface carbonates, thermal decomposition is usually applied. Due to the high sintering capability and low melting point of silver, a firing temperature lower than 900 \u00b0C should be employed [27] . The FT-IR spectra of the Ag/BSCF composites after firing at 900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 4 . The vibration band for NO 3 \u2212 vanished after the heat treatment. However, the vibration band for CO 3 2\u2212 was still observed in HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF electrode. This implies that such a thermal treatment temperature is insufficient to remove the surface carbonate. It has also been reported that carbonates can only be eliminated thoroughly at temperature higher than 950 \u00b0C under an argon atmosphere [29] . However, such a high temperature would result in sintering or melting of the silver. Temperature-programmed oxygen desorption (O 2 -TPD) curves of the Ag/BSCF composites prepared from the two different reduction processes and fired at 850 \u00b0C are depicted in Fig. 5 . Oxygen desorption occurred in two separate zones, which started at approximately 300 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively. For convenience, the oxygen desorbed in these two zones is labeled \u03b1- and \u03b2-oxygen, respectively [32] . The O 2 -TPD reflects the change of oxidation states of cobalt and iron in BSCF. The oxygen desorption at the lower temperature zone, i.e., \u03b1-oxygen, is associated with the reduction of Co 4+ /Fe 4+ to Co 3+ /Fe 3+ , while the \u03b2-oxygen desorption process is associated with the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . The oxygen desorption characteristic for N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF is similar to pure BSCF. This implies the micro-structure and phase composition of the BSCF using N 2 H 4 as the reducing agent was not altered significantly. For the case of HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF, the intensity of the \u03b1-oxygen decreased while the intensity of \u03b2-oxygen increased. The A-site cation-deficient BSCF, with a composition of (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 0.8 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 , was also tested for comparison. The profiles for HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF and the A-site deficient BSCF are very similar, which indicates the possible formation of an A-site cation deficient BSCF in the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF electrode. This agrees well with the fact that the HCOOH has a relatively high acidity and it is prone to react with Ba or Sr in BSCF. Consequently, some of the Ba and Sr were lost in BSCF, which lead to formation of the A-site deficient BSCF. Due to the low concentration of Ag (3 wt.%) and by-products in Ag/BSCF composite, they can not be detected by XRD as shown in Fig. 6 a . In order to further verify above results, the ratio of AgNO 3 /BSCF was increased to 30 wt.%. XRD patterns of the Ag/BSCF composite powders calcined at 850 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 b. The diffraction peaks of the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF composite powders can still be indexed well to BSCF and Ag. This implies that the N 2 H 4 successfully reduced Ag + to Ag without damaging the BSCF phase, even at a much higher dosage. However, for the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF composite, the carbonates in the family of Ba x Sr 1- x CO 3 were detected as well as the BSCF and Ag main phases. 3.2 Electrochemical behavior Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells were obtained at 550\u2013700 \u00b0C under open-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 7 , all impedance spectra contain two separable depressed arcs, suggesting that at least two different electrode processes limited the oxygen reduction reaction. In order to separate these two processes, the impedance spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit with a standardized configuration of R ohm ( R E1 \u2212 CPE 1 )( R E2 \u2212 CPE 2 ). The overall ohmic resistance, R ohm , includes the electrolyte resistance, the electrode ohmic resistance, and the lead resistance. The high-frequency resistance is probably associated with charge-transfer processes ( R E1 ). The low-frequency arc is ascribed to diffusion processes ( R E2 ), including the adsorption\u2013desorption of oxygen, oxygen diffusion at the gas-cathode interface, and the surface diffusion of intermediate oxygen species [27,33\u201340] . The difference between the real axes intercepts of the impedance plot is considered to be the cathode polarization resistance ( R p = R E1 + R E2 ). The symbols in Fig. 7 represent the measured data, and the solid lines are fitted curves. Good agreement is observed between the equivalent circuit and the observed impedance data. This implies that the equivalent circuit is a reasonable approximation. As can be seen, the preparation methods evidently influenced both the charge-transfer and diffusion processes. The cell with the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode showed smaller arcs at all operating temperatures. Fig. 8 shows the Arrhenius plots of the total cathode polarization resistance ( R p ) for the cells with the cathodes prepared by the two different methods. Some studies have shown that adding Ag to the BSCF matrix improved the electrochemical performance of the electrode [26,27] . A similar trend was also observed for the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode in this study. For example, the value of R p is only 0.038 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C, lower than the value of pure BSCF reported by our previous studies [32,41] . However, the values of R p for the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode are much higher than those of the pure BSCF. The apparent activation energies of the oxygen reduction reaction obtained from the slopes of the plots in Fig. 8 are listed in Table 1 . The activation energy of the R p is 80.1 kJ mol \u22121 for the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF, which is lower than the value of \u223c109 kJ mol \u22121 for the pure BSCF [32] , while the activation energy of R p for the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF is as high as 138.9 kJ mol \u22121 . The fitted impedance parameters are given in Fig. 9 . For the pure BSCF cathode, the resistances are 0.044 and 0.063 \u03a9 cm 2 for the charge-transfer process and the diffusion process at 600 \u00b0C, respectively [32] . As compared to pure BSCF electrode, these two processes were improved for the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode, while the two processes deteriorated for the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode. The carbonates in the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode not only blocked the oxygen adsorption and surface diffusion, but also occupied the active sites for oxygen reduction. Therefore, an increase of the R E1 and R E2 , and thus an increase in the activation energies for these two processes, was observed for the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF ( Table 1 ). 3.3 Single-cell performance Complete fuel cells adopting the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF and N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathodes were built based on the thin-film SDC electrolyte. Fig. 10 shows the performances of the single cells using H 2 as the fuel and air as the cathode atmosphere, operated at 500\u2013600 \u00b0C. A peak power density of 826 mW cm \u22122 was achieved for the cells with the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode at 600 \u00b0C. As expected, poorer performances were observed for the cells based on the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathodes. The peak power density at 600 \u00b0C was only 672 mW cm \u22122 for the cell with the HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathode. Shown in Fig. 11 are the typical impedance spectra for the cells with the two composite cathodes, measured at 600 \u00b0C under open circuit conditions. Here, the intercept with the real axis at high frequencies represents the resistance of the electrolyte and lead wires (about 0.22 \u03a9 cm 2 ), whereas the resistance between the two intercepts with the real axis corresponds to the impedance of the two interfaces, i.e. the cathode-electrolyte interface and the anode-electrolyte interface. The electrode ASRs are 0.048 and 0.079 \u03a9 cm 2 for the cells with the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF and HCHO-reduced Ag/BSCF cathodes, respectively. Since the anodes are identical, the differences in the electrode ASRs can be essentially attributed to the cathode. Our previous studies also indicated that the carbonates in the cathode can significantly influence the ORR activity, and eliminating the carbonates is helpful to improve the cathode performance [29,30] . 4 Conclusions The Ag/BSCF composite cathodes for LT-SOFCs were prepared by electroless deposition using N 2 H 4 and HCHO as reducing agents. The silver particles originating from the two processes have similar particle sizes and dispersion over the BSCF surface. As compared to a pristine BSCF electrode, the electrochemical performance of the composite cathode was improved by using N 2 H 4 as the reducing agent. The ASR of N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF was as low as 0.038 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C. However, when the HCHO was used as the reducing agent, the carbonates in the family of Ba x Sr 1\u2212 x CO 3 formed during the preparation, which blocked the active sites for oxygen adsorption and reduction reactions and led to an increase in the polarization resistances of both the charge-transfer process and the diffusion process. As a result, the anode-supported single cell with the N 2 H 4 -reduced Ag/BSCF cathode showed improved performance and reached peak power densities of 826, 562 and 428 mW cm \u22122 at 600, 550 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively. Reducing agents that could lead to the formation of carbonates are not recommended in the preparation of silver-modified perovskite electrode that contained Ba and/or Sr alkaline earth metal ions.

        "abstract": "Chemically stable BaZr 0.8Y 0.2O 3-\u03b4 (BZY) oxide is limited to applications as an electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because of its poor sintering behavior. This study attempts to improve the sinterability and conductivity of BZY using the partial substitution of Zr 4+ in BZY with Nd 3+. An oxide with the nominal composition of BaZr 0.7Nd 0.1Y 0.2O 3-\u03b4 (BZNY) is specifically investigated. Results from X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrate Nd 3+ is successfully doped into the lattice as anticipated and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations verify the morphology and crystal structure of the BZNY powder. Dilatometric measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations provide verification that the sinterability of the oxide is effectively improved by introducing Nd 3+. XRD and CO 2-TPD results demonstrate that BZNY is relatively stable with respect to the CO 2 atmosphere. The total conductivity of BZNY in wet H 2 is 2.76\u00d710 -3Scm -1 at 600\u00b0C. An anode-supported thin-film BZNY electrolyte (~30\u03bcm) cell is fabricated, and the electrolyte layer is found to be well densified after co-sintering with the anode substrate at 1450\u00b0C for 5h. The cell delivers a peak power density of 142mWcm -2 at 700\u00b0C, higher than the reported values for a similar cell with BZY electrolyte. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a facile and effective way for the fabrication of a flexible, homogeneous and neat \u03b1-MoO3 thin-film electrode for lithium-ion batteries with high performance without using any binder and conductive additives. Single-crystalline \u03b1-MoO3 nanobelts with uniform width of around 200 nm and length at the micrometer level are first synthesized by a simple water-based hydrothermal route. The as-obtained \u03b1-MoO3 slurry is then directly deposited onto a copper foil current collector by the doctor blade method. The formation of the \u03b1-MoO3 film and its good adhesion to the current collector is realized via van der Waals attraction forces through a drying process. The structure and morphology of the \u03b1-MoO3 nanobelt particles and thin-film electrode are systematically characterized by XRD, Raman spectra, TEM, SEM and XPS techniques, and the electrochemical properties are investigated by CV and constant current discharge-charge test techniques. The \u03b1-MoO 3 film electrode exhibits a reversible specific capacity of \u223c1000 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 and a stable capacity retention of 387-443 mA h g-1 at 2000 mA g-1, indicating its high Li storage capacity, superior rate performance and good cycling stability.

        "abstract": "A novel Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 + LaCoO 3 (BSCF + LC) composite oxide was investigated for the potential application as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells based on a Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) electrolyte. The LC oxide was added to BSCF cathode in order to improve its electrical conductivity. X-ray diffraction examination demonstrated that the solid-state reaction between LC and BSCF phases occurred at temperatures above 950 \u00b0C and formed the final product with the composition: La 0.316 Ba 0.342 Sr 0.342 Co 0.863 Fe 0.137 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 at 1100 \u00b0C. The inter-diffusion between BSCF and LC was identified by the environmental scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray examination. The electrical conductivity of the BSCF + LC composite oxide increased with increasing calcination temperature, and reached a maximum value of \u223c300 S cm \u22121 at a calcination temperature of 1050 \u00b0C, while the electrical conductivity of the pure BSCF was only \u223c40 S cm \u22121 . The improved conductivity resulted in attractive cathode performance. An area-specific resistance as low as 0.21 \u03a9 cm 2 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C for the BSCF (70 vol.%) + LC (30 vol.%) composite cathode calcined at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h. Peak power densities as high as \u223c700 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C and \u223c525 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C were reached for the thin-film fuel cells with the optimized cathode composition and calcination temperatures.

They are believed to be a promising alternative power source to traditional mobile and stationary sources, such as the internal combustion engine and coal burning power plants. Among the various kinds of fuel cells, solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have the benefits of the high energy efficiency and fuel flexibility because of their high operating temperature. Therefore, they have received considerable attention in recent years. Typical SOFCs are based on the yttira-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and operate at \u223c1000 \u00b0C [1] . Such a high operating temperature is beneficial for accelerating the electrode reactions. However, it also introduces several serious problems or drawbacks, such as an interfacial reaction between the electrode and electrolyte to form insulating phase(s), the densification of the electrode layer due to high-temperature sintering, possible crack formation due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the cell components and the requirement of high-cost La(Ca)CrO 3 as the interconnect material [2] . The decrease of operating temperature would result in reducing reactivity between the cell components and therefore an improvement of fuel cell stability. Furthermore, much cheaper metallic interconnects and more flexible glass gasket sealants may be applied [3,4] . Therefore, there is a general tendency for SOFCs towards a reduced operating temperature (<800 \u00b0C) [5\u20139] . However, the decrease of operating temperature leads to a significant decrease in electrode activity, especially for the cathode [10\u201313] . As a result, the conventional SOFC cathode, strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM), is not suitable for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) due to its low activity below 800 \u00b0C. Nowadays, there are growing interests in developing an improved performance cathode for IT-SOFCs [14\u201320] . Promising candidates are normally based on the mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conducting oxides, such as Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSC) and La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF) [21\u201325] . The mixed conductivity extends the active oxygen reduction site from the typical electrolyte-electrode-gas triple-phase boundary to the entire exposed cathode surface, therefore greatly reducing the cathode polarization at low operating temperatures. Very recently, Shao and Haile [26] reported a mixed conducting Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) oxide as a potential cathode material for Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC)-electrolyte based IT-SOFCs. The application of BSCF as a cathode material has attracted a lot of attention [27\u201331] . Although very promising results were reported, some disadvantages of the BSCF cathode may include the high TEC and the low electrical conductivity. A TEC as large as 21\u201324 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 and a conductivity of only 40\u201360 S cm \u22121 under air is reported [32,33] . A high electrical conductivity is important for the efficient current collection and the decrease of ohmic polarization resistance, while the correct TEC of the cathode is also important for compatibility with the electrolyte. Mixed conducting oxides usually have a higher TEC than the electrolyte. The strategy of using a composite oxide by mixing it with a second phase is frequently applied to reduce the TEC and increase the cathode performance of the SSC and LSCF cathodes, such as SSC + SDC and LSCF + Gd 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (GDC) [13,34] . The performance of the BSCF + SDC has also been reported recently [26,31] . However, no significant improvement in fuel cell performance was observed, because BSCF by itself is a high oxygen ionic conductor. This is very different from the cases of the SSC or LSCF based cathodes [13,26,34] . Furthermore, the electrical conductivity decreased with the formation of a BSCF + SDC composite oxide due to the pure ionic conductivity of the SDC. An increase of the ohmic polarization from the cathode layer and the decrease of current collecting efficiency may be experienced for the BSCF + SDC cathode. In this study, LaCoO 3 (LC), a high electrical conducting oxide with a reported electrical conductivity as high as 1000 S cm \u22121 [35] , was investigated as the second phase to form a new BSCF + LC composite cathode for IT-SOFCs. LC oxide has negligible oxygen ionic conductivity as compared to BSCF at reduced temperatures, so the introduction of LC would then decrease the overall oxygen ionic conductivity. However, a volume percent of \u223c28\u201336% is usually required for the formation of a percolating LC phase [25] , therefore, throughout this study 30 vol.% LC, otherwise mentioned, was applied in BSCF + LC composite oxide. The BSCF + LC composite oxide was prepared and the optimum firing temperature of the cathode layer was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrical conductivity, cell performance, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and AC impedance measurements. 2 Experimental 2.1 Cathode powder preparation Phase-pure BSCF and LC oxide powders were synthesized by a sol\u2013gel method in which the appropriate amounts of metal nitrates served as the metal sources and a combination of EDTA and citric acid as the complexing agents [36] . Mild heating under stirring, induced the gelation of the mixed solution. The resulting gels were pre-treated at 250 \u00b0C for 12 h to remove the organics, and then calcined under stagnant air at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h to obtain the final products. 2.2 Fuel-cell fabrication A symmetrical cell with the configuration of: electrode|SDC|electrode was used for the impedance studies. Dense SDC pellets of 12 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm in thickness were prepared by dry pressing and sintered under air at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h. To prepare the composite electrode, the BSCF and LC oxide powders with the volume ratio of 70:30 were first dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension by high-energy ball milling (Fritsch Pulverisettle 6) at the rotation rate of 400 rpm for 0.5 h. The obtained slurry was painted symmetrically on both surfaces of the SDC pellet, followed by calcined at 950\u20131100 \u00b0C for 5 h under stagnant air. The cathodes were named, for example, as BSCF + LC30-950, which means the cathode was consisted of 70 vol.% BSCF and 30 vol.% LC and fired at 950 \u00b0C. The silver paste was painted onto the electrode surface as the current collector. Anode-supported cells with SDC as electrolyte were prepared using a co-pressing technique. Anode powders consisted of 60 wt.% NiO and 40 wt.% SDC were prepared by mixing NiO and SDC in an agate mortar. To fabricate the single cell, the well-mixed NiO-SDC powder was firstly pressed as a substrate, SDC powder was then added onto the substrate and pressed again to form a bi-layer pellet. The bi-layer pellets were then fired under stagnant air at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h for the densification of the electrolyte layer. The BSCF + LC based slurry was painted onto the central surface of the electrolyte and fired at 950 or 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under air. The resulting coin-shape cathode had a thickness of 10\u201320 \u03bcm and an effective area of 0.72 cm 2 . 2.3 Single cell test I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-probe configuration. Three percent H 2 O humidified H 2 at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 (STP) was fed into the anode chamber as fuel and air into the cathode chamber as oxidant gas. Gas flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers. Ag paste was adopted as the current collector. 2.4 Electrochemical impedance test The electrode performance was investigated with a symmetrical cell or complete cell configuration by the AC impedance method using an electrochemical workstation Solartron 1287 potentiostat and a 1260A frequency response analyzer. The frequency range applied was from 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions. The overall impedance data were fitted by a complex non-linear least square (CNLS) fitting program in ZView 2.9b software. 2.5 Other characterizations X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) patterns were used to analyze the chemical compatibilities against high temperature. The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes were characterized using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) attachment. The specific surface areas of the samples were characterized by N 2 adsorption using a BELSORP II instrument at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe DC technique, using Ag paste as electrodes. The current and the voltage were detected by the Keithley 2420 source meter at intervals of 5 \u00b0C over a temperature range of 300\u2013900 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion Cobalt-based perovskites usually have a high reactivity. The solid-state reaction between LC and BSCF phases was first investigated. As shown in Fig. 1 , pure-phase BSCF and LC oxides had a cubic and a rhombohedral perovskite structure, respectively. After calcination at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h under air, the BSCF + LC composite oxide still displayed mainly a physical mixture of the LC and BSCF oxides, based on the XRD results. This suggests that a solid-state reaction between BSCF and LC phases was relatively weak at 950 \u00b0C. With increase of calcination temperature to 1000 \u00b0C, the diffraction peak (around 32\u00b0) of BSCF at mirror index (1 1 0) was significantly broadened as compared to fresh BSCF, and the two diffraction peaks at mirror index of (1 1 0) and (1 0 4) for the rhombohedral perovskite structure of LC merged into one broad peak. This suggests that a certain degree of reaction might have happened between the BSCF and LC phases at 1000 \u00b0C. The solid-state reaction is usually via the inter-diffusion between the adjacent two phases. At a calcination temperature of 1000 \u00b0C, the inter-diffusion should be limited and a compositional gradient across the interface is likely built, which may be the cause of the broadening of the diffraction peaks for the BSCF and LC. With further increase in the calcination temperature to 1050 \u00b0C, the peak intensity of the BSCF and LC phases was significantly reduced, while a new cubic perovskite phase with a lattice constant of a = 3.879 \u00c5 was formed. When the calcination temperature was 1100 \u00b0C, the BSCF and LC phases totally disappeared, and the final product was composed only of the new perovskite-structured oxide with a = 3.879 \u00c5. It is well known that perovskite structure is flexible enough to adopt a wide range of metal ions in its A and B sites. Based on their ionic radius sizes, La 3+ , Ba 2+ and Sr 2+ occupied the A-site of the perovskite while cobalt and iron ions occupied the B-site. Because of the unit for the mole ratio of (La, Ba, Sr) to (Co, Fe) in BSCF + LC composite, the complete reaction between BSCF (70 vol.%) and LC (30 vol.%) was likely to form a perovskite with the final composition of La 0.316 Ba 0.342 Sr 0.342 Co 0.863 Fe 0.137 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (LBSCF). This assumption was indicated by the SEM-EDX examination of the 1100 \u00b0C calcined composite oxide, and also supported by the successful synthesis of a pure phase perovskite with the target composition of LBSCF. The surface morphologies and micro-composition of BSCF, LC and BSCF + LC composite oxide calcined at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding EDX results are listed in Table 1 . BSCF had a primary particle size of 1\u20132 \u03bcm ( Fig. 2 A), much larger than that of LC, which is 100\u2013200 nm ( Fig. 2 B). A BET surface area measurement shows that BSCF had a low surface area of 0.25 m 2 g \u22121 , as compared to 4.0 m 2 g \u22121 for LC. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that the physically mixed BSCF + LC composite oxide is characterized by the fine LC particles surrounding the surface of a BSCF large particle. For the BSCF + LC composite oxide calcined at 950 or 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h, their morphologies did not change significantly from the fresh one; however, the attachment of LC to the BSCF surface was obviously improved. The EDX results of the 950 \u00b0C calcined sample demonstrated that the fine particles were mainly composed of La and Co and oxygen. However, small concentrations of Ba, Sr and Fe elements were also detected demonstrating the inter-diffusion of BSCF into the lattice structure of LC. The big particles were mainly composed of Ba, Sr, Co, Fe and O. However, La was also detected in those particles demonstrating the diffusion of LC into the BSCF lattice. For the 1050 \u00b0C calcined sample, the amount of the large-size grains decreased substantially. EDX examination showed that the compositional difference of the different zones was decreased as compared to the lower temperature calcined samples (950 and 1000 \u00b0C). However, some BSCF-enriched and LC-enriched zones were still detected. For the 1100 \u00b0C calcined sample, all the zones showed the homogeneous composition of LBSCF within the experimental error, which indicates the complete reaction between BSCF and LC. The electrical conductivities of BSCF, LC and BSCF + LC composite oxide calcined at various temperatures for 5 h under air, are shown in Fig. 3 . Due to the reaction between BSCF and LC at high temperature, we were not able to obtain a dense sintering body of the composite oxide. The measured porosity of the sintering bar for BSCF + LC composite oxide at 950, 1000 and 1050 \u00b0C was 13.1%, 12.0% and 14.3%, respectively. The conductivity of BSCF + LC composite reported here was the adjusted value by taking account of the porosity. LC reached a maximum conductivity of \u223c685 S cm \u22121 at around 450 \u00b0C, similar to that reported by Mineshige et al. for a high temperature quenched LC sample [37] , but smaller than that reported by Petrov et al. [38] . BSCF + LC composite oxide had an obviously improved electrical conductivity as compared to the single BSCF oxide, especially at lower operating temperatures. The higher the calcination temperature of the BSCF + LC composite oxide, the higher the conductivity showed. A maximum conductivity of \u223c300 S cm \u22121 at the operating temperature of \u223c300 \u00b0C for BSCF-LC30-1050 was observed. For the BSCF-LC30-950 and BSCF-LC30-1000, the conductivities increased firstly with the increase of operating temperature, reached a maximum at an operating temperature of \u223c365 and \u223c305 \u00b0C, respectively, and then decreased with the further increase of operating temperature. While for BSCF-LC30-1050, the conductivity monotonically decreased with the increase of operating temperature. The conductivity of composite oxide is closely related with the mixing state and the possible reaction between the two phases. It was reported that the electrical conductivity for La 1\u2212 x Sr x CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (LSC) increased with the increase of Sr doping concentration at x < 0.4 [38] . The reaction between BSCF and LC led to the incorporation of Ba 2+ /Sr 2+ into the structure of LC, therefore, resulting in the increase of the conductivity of the LC phase. The diffusion of LC into BSCF also increased the conductivity of BSCF phase, as supported by the higher conductivity of La 0.3 Ba 0.35 Sr 0.35 Co 0.86 Fe 0.14 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (LBSCF) than BSCF from Fig. 3 . With the increase of the calcination temperature, the solid-state reaction between BSCF and LC phases increased, therefore, an increase of the electrical conductivity was observed for BSCF + LC composite oxide. The temperature dependence of the conductivity for LSC was found to change from first increase and then decrease with temperature at low Sr 2+ concentration in LSC, and then to monotonically decrease with temperature at x \u2265 0.25 (La 1 \u2212 x Sr x CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 ) [37] . Because of the much higher electronic conductivity of LC than BSCF, the electrical conductivity of the composite oxide was contributed more significantly from the LC phase. With the increase of calcination temperature, more significant diffusion of BSCF into LC phase occured, and explained the observed phenomena of increased conductivity of the BSCF + LC composite oxide with increase of calcination temperature. The decreased conductivity for LBSCF as compared to the composite oxide calcined at 1050 \u00b0C and was likely caused by excessive Sr doping and the blocking effect of Ba 2+ to the ambipolar transporting of electrons. The cathode performance for the BSCF, LC and BSCF + LC composite oxide calcined at 950 \u00b0C was then investigated by the AC impedance spectroscopy based on a symmetrical cell configuration under asymmetric air atmosphere. The Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for BSCF, BSCF-LC30-950 and BSCF-LC50-950 at 600 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 4 . As discussed by previous workers [30] , the high-frequency intercept of the impedance spectrum gives the ohmic resistance of the cell ( R ohm ), which includes the resistive contributions of the electrolyte, the two electrodes, the current collectors and the lead wires. In this study, the ohmic resistance of the two electrodes, the current collectors and the lead wires was reasonably considered to be negligible. The low-frequency intercept gives the total resistance ( R ohm + R p ), which includes the ohmic resistance of the cell, concentration polarization (mass-transfer or gas-diffusion polarization) resistance and the effective interfacial polarization resistance associated with the electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The ohmic resistance ( R ohm ) and the total interfacial polarization resistance of the cell were extracted by fitting the impedance spectra to an equivalent circuit with a configuration of R ohm ( R -CPE) HF ( R -CPE) LF . The simulation data are shown in Table 2 . The resistance at the high frequency may reflect the charge transfer ( R 1 ), and the lower frequency arc of the oxygen dissociation and bulk or surface oxygen diffusion process ( R 2 ). An increase in both the charge transfer polarization resistance and the oxygen dissociation/surface oxygen diffusion polarization resistance was observed with the increase of LC doping concentration, coincided with the fact of worse cathode performance of LC than BSCF. The temperature dependence of the area specific resistances (ASRs) of BSCF, SCF-LC30-950 and SCF-LC50-950 are shown in Fig. 5 . As compared to the pure BSCF cathode, the performance of the BSCF + LC composite cathode decreased slightly. As a whole, BSCF + LC composite cathode still displayed very promising results, for example, an ASR as low as 0.21 and 0.43 \u03a9 cm 2 was obtained (at 600 \u00b0C) for the 30 and 50 vol.% LC contained BSCF + LC composite cathodes calcined at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h, respectively. Based on the XRD results, the calcination temperature had significant effect on the phase reaction between LC and BSCF. The influence of calcination temperature on the cathode performance of BSCF-LC30 oxide was then investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . It was found that the 950 and 1000 \u00b0C calcined samples showed the similar cathode performance, while the increase of calcination temperature from 1000 to 1050 \u00b0C resulted in the slight increase of the ASRs. The further increase of calcination temperature to 1100 \u00b0C resulted in the sharp increase of the ASRs. Based on the results in Figs. 1 and 2 , the phase reaction at calcination temperature of 950 and 1000 \u00b0C was only limited. The inter-diffusion of BSCF and LC resulted in the limited incorporation of LC and BSCF to each other. The incorporation of BSCF into LC resulted in an increase of the oxygen reduction properties of LC due to the creation of oxygen vacancy in the LC lattice and also the increase of overall electrical conductivity of the cathode, while the incorporation of LC into BSCF resulted in the decrease oxygen reduction activity of BSCF. The best calcination temperature would be an overall balance for the performance of the BSCF and LC phases in the BSCF + LC composite, which should be around 950\u20131000 \u00b0C in this study. For a calcination temperature of 1050 \u00b0C or higher, however, the reaction between BSCF and LC was so seriously, the deterioration of the performance for the BSCF phase was more significantly than the improvement from the LC phase, therefore, a decrease in overall cathode performance was observed. Therefore, the calcination temperature of 950 and 1000 \u00b0C was then selected for the fabrication of whole cells for I \u2013 V polarization study. Complete fuel cells of Ni + SDC anode supported thin-film SDC electrolyte (\u223c30 \u03bcm) with BSCF-LC30 composite oxide as cathode was built. I \u2013 V curves for the cells using 3% water humidified hydrogen was tested and the results are shown in Fig. 7 . Both fuel cells displayed attractive performances. A peak power density as high as \u223c700 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C, and \u223c525 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C was achieved for the 950 \u00b0C calcined one. At higher operating temperatures, the fuel cell with the 950 \u00b0C calcined cathode shows slightly better performance than the 1000 \u00b0C calcined one. While at a low operating temperature, such difference was negligible. The corresponding EIS are shown in Fig. 8 . The electrode polarization resistance from the EIS shown here are included for both the anode and cathode polarizations. Even at a low operating temperature of 550 \u00b0C, the ohmic resistance still dominated the cell resistance both for the 950 and 1000 \u00b0C calcined samples. Therefore, a reduction of the electrolyte resistance by further reducing the electrolyte thickness or increasing the electrolyte conductivity with improved preparation techniques or increasing the raw material purity would substantially increase of the fuel cell performance. 4 Conclusion A new BSCF + LC composite cathode is reported for potential application in IT-SOFCs. LC oxide was added as a high electrically conducting phase to improve the performance of the BSCF cathode. A solid-state reaction between LC and BSCF was observed above 950 \u00b0C. A new phase with the composition of La 0.316 Ba 0.342 Sr 0.342 Co 0.863 Fe 0.137 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 with a lattice parameter of 3.789 \u00c5 was formed at 1100 \u00b0C. The inter diffusion between the BSCF and LC phases was identified by the SEM-EDX results. The electrical conductivity of BSCF + LC increased with the increase of the calcination temperature and reached a maximum of \u223c300 S cm \u22121 at 1050 \u00b0C. The improved conductivity resulted in attractive cathode performance for IT-SOFCs. An ASR as low as 0.21 \u03a9 cm 2 was obtained at 600 \u00b0C for the 30 vol.% LC contained BSCF + LC composite cathode calcined at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h (BSCF-LC30-950). A peak power density as high as \u223c700 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C, and \u223c525 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C was achieved for a fuel cell with a BSCF-LC30-950 cathode. All the above results suggest a potential application of the BSCF + LC composite oxide as the cathode in IT-SOFCs.

XRD and O(2)-TPD results demonstrated that cation exchange between BZCY and PBC perovskites simultaneously occurs from the formation of Co(3+)-doped BZCY and Y(3+)-doped PBC. This event does not significantly change the cathodic polarization resistance. Under real fuel cell conditions, neither the electrolyte nor electrode resistances were significantly affected by the phase reaction and morphologic change of PBC. Anode-supported cells with an electrolyte thickness of approximately 30 microm were successfully fabricated via a dual dry pressing process. Relatively high performance of 520 and 407 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C was achieved for the cell with a PBC cathode fired at 950 and 1100 degrees C, respectively. A low electrode polarization resistance of 0.06 ohms cm(2) was achieved at 700 degrees C for the PBC cathode calcined at 950 degrees C.",

        "abstract": "Ni-SDC, Ni-ScSZ, and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Sc 0.2 Mn 0.8 O 3 (LSSM) anodes are investigated for SOFCs operating on CO. O 2 -TPO and SEM results demonstrate LSSM is greatly superior to nickel cermet anodes in suppressing carbon deposition. H 2 -TPR suggests there is strong chemical interaction between NiO and ScSZ, which helps to suppress the carbon deposition. Raman spectroscopy of the carbon-deposited nickel cermet anodes demonstrates the graphitization degree of carbon is enhanced with increasing temperature. The cell performance is much lower operating on CO as compared to H 2 , and the reduction is the largest for the cell with Ni-SDC anode. Furthermore, steady performance degradation is observed for all three cells operating on pure CO which is irreversible for the cell with Ni-SDC anode while largely reversible for the cell with Ni-ScSZ anode. The degradation for the cell with an LSSM anode is found to be due to the phase instability of LSSM in pure CO atmosphere. By applying a mixture of CO and CO 2 as the fuel or under polarization, the phase of LSSM is stabilized; as a result, the cell is stably operated on CO under current polarization. This suggests that LSSM and Ni-ScSZ anodes are greatly superior to the Ni-SDC anode for operation on CO.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigate and contrast the perovskite structure of La1-x Srx Co O3-\u03b4 and La1-x Srx Co0.9 Nb0.1O3-\u03b4 (both for x=0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.0) as well as their oxygen nonstoichiometry, oxygen bulk-diffusion, and surface exchange coefficients to describe their distinct performance as ceramic oxygen ionic transport membranes. Le Bail refinements of x-ray diffraction data demonstrate that except for SrCo O3-\u03b4, the structure for all title compounds at room temperature can be fitted adequately using rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure. The presence of lanthanum is found to reduce the solubility of niobium in perovskite lattice. Aside from Sr Co0.9 Nb0.1 O3-\u03b4, structure deterioration or transformation occurs for all title compounds upon subjected to modest reducing atmosphere of nitrogen. Oxygen permeation testing reveals that Sr0.9 Co0.9 Nb0.1 O3-\u03b4 membrane exhibits the largest fluxes among all the title compounds, followed by La0.1 Sr0.9 Co0.9 Nb0.1 O 3-\u03b4 and La0.1 Sr0.9 Co0.9 Nb0.1 O3-\u03b4 and La0.1 Sr0.9 Co O3-\u03b4. The oxygen permeation values exhibit exact the same trend as a function of composition with the bulk-diffusion and surface exchange coefficients values indicating both bulk-diffusion and surface exchange limits the oxygen transport through title compounds. In addition, 300-hour permeation testing on the best doped compounds, La0.1 Sr0.9 Co 0.9 Nb0.1 O3-\u03b4 and La0.1 Sr0.9 Co O3-\u03b4 demonstrates that La0.1 Sr0.9 Co O3-\u03b4 has better performance stability, e.g. lower degradation percentage with time relative to its non niobium doped counterpart. \u00a9 2011 The Electrochemical Society.",

Keywords Perovskite Mixed conductivity Membrane Oxygen permeation 1 Introduction Some composite oxides show mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) properties at elevated temperatures. They are important materials for a variety of electrical and catalytic processes. Due to their potential application as ceramic membranes for oxygen separation [1\u20135] and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to value-added products [6\u20139] , and as cathodes for reduced-temperature solid oxide fuel cells, the MIEC oxides have been received considerable attention recently [10\u201312] . For the typical oxygen separation process based on MIEC membrane, molecule oxygen from the oxygen rich side atmosphere first adsorbs over the membrane surface, where it dissociates into oxygen ion and electron hole. Such electrically charged species then simultaneously migrate through the membrane bulk under the driven of oxygen partial pressure gradient to the other side of membrane surface (oxygen lean side), where they recombine to form molecule oxygen. The molecule oxygen finally desorbs from the membrane surface and evolves into the oxygen lean side atmosphere. From the macroscopic point of view, as if the molecule oxygen permeated through the membrane. Due to the oxygen-ion conducting mechanism for the oxygen permeation process, a theoretical oxygen selectivity of 100% is expected. The significant advantage of oxygen separation based on MIEC membrane over traditional cryogenic distillation process is the continuous production of high purity oxygen with substantial reduction in capital cost both for investment and operation . Perovskite is one of the most important lattice structures that may display mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductivity at high temperature. The simplest perovskite is nominated as ABO 3 . The mixed conductivity of perovskite is typically created by the doping strategy. Normally different types of metal ions are applied for the A- and B-sites of ABO 3 perovskite because of their different requirement for the ionic radius. The A-site metal ions are mainly composed of alkaline earth, alkaline and lanthanide ions and B-site mainly of transition metal ions [13\u201317] . When the A-site of perovskite is doped with a cation with a lower oxidation state, the electrical neutrality can be maintained by the formation of oxygen vacancy or the rise of oxidation state of the metal ions at the B-site. On the contrary, the substitution of the cation with a higher oxidation state may inhibit the formation of oxygen vacancy or the rise of oxidation state of the metal ions at the B-site. The oxygen vacancy is the carrier for oxygen ion, which is closely related with the oxygen ionic conductivity of the oxide, while the electron hopping between the valence-variable metal ions at the B-site leads to the electronic conduction. Promising materials for MIEC membrane should have stable phase structure over the operational oxygen partial pressure and temperature range and high oxygen permeability. For most of the perovskite oxides possessing high ionic and electronic conductivity, they have unfortunately poor chemical and structural stability at reduced environments [18\u201320] . The stable phase structure of the materials is a pre-requirement for high and stable oxygen permeation flux [21\u201323] , therefore it is of particular importance. The objective of this work is to exploit new perovskite-type oxides as MIEC membrane. For the first time, double-site Y 3+ -doped Sr 1\u2212 x Y x Co 1\u2212 y Y y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite oxides were reported. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis Sr 1\u2212 x Y x Co 1\u2212 y Y y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( x = 0.0\u20130.4, y = 0.0\u201315) composites oxides were synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [24,25] . Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 x H 2 O, Y(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 x H 2 O (all in A.R. grade), were applied as the raw materials for the metal-ion sources. For the precise controlling of the doping level, the metal nitrates were first made into aqueous solutions (\u223c1 M) separately with their precise concentrations determined by EDTA titration technique. For the preparation of SYCY oxides, necessary amounts of metal nitrates in the state of aqueous solution were prepared into a mixed solution according to the aimed composition, followed by the introduction of EDTA and citric acid as the complexing agents at the mole ratio of total metal ions: EDTA: citric acid = 1:1:2. The pH value of the system was controlled at \u223c6 with the help of NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O. Continuous heating at 90 \u00b0C resulted in evaporating water from the solution until a transparent purple gel was obtained, which was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and followed by calcined at various temperatures in air for 5 h to get the products with the final composition and phase structure. 2.2 Membrane fabrication The as-synthesized oxide powders calcined from 900 \u00b0C were grinded by a high-energy ball miller (FRITSCH Pullerisette 6) under acetone media at the rotation of 500 for 30 min, which was then dried and pressed into disk-shape membrane in a stainless steel mold (15 mm in diameter) under a hydraulic pressure of approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 Pa. These green pellets were sintered in an electrical box furnace at 1100\u20131250 \u00b0C for 2\u20135 h in air at a heating/cooling rate of 1\u20132 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The sintered membranes had a diameter of \u223c12 mm with relative density >92% as measured by the Archimedes\u2019 liquid displacement technique using pure water as the medium. 2.3 Characterization The crystal structure of the synthesized powders or sintered membranes was characterized with an X-ray diffractormeter (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. For the phase stability tests, the samples were put into a U-type quartz tube and treated at 850 \u00b0C in O 2 , Air, or N 2 for a certain period (6\u2013100 h). After the treatment, the sample was cooled down to room temperature under the same atmosphere for phase structure examination. For the oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) experiment, about 0.05\u20130.1 g oxide powder was dropped into a U-type quartz reactor with the inner diameter of \u223c0.3 mm, a K-type thermocouple was located near the powder for temperature monitoring and also controlling, a constant helium flow (purity > 99.999%) at the rate of 20 ml min \u22121 (STP: standard temperature and pressure) was introduced to the reactor which was connected with a mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC-20). After flowing with helium for 30 min at room temperature to get rid of the surface weakly adsorbed species, the reactor was heated at 10 \u00b0C per min to 950 \u00b0C. Lattice oxygen was released from the oxide lattice during the heating, which was carried out by the flowing helium to the mass spectrometer for in-situ oxygen concentration analysis. The electrical conductivity was measured by four-probe dc method based on sintered bars of approximately dimensions 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm. The measurements were performed in air upon cooling from 900 to 300 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C per step. A constant current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage response on the two voltage wires was recorded using a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter. Sufficient time was applied for the conductivity to reach its steady state. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to a maximum value of 2 A, while only the data following the ohmic law was applied for the calculation of the conductivity. 2.4 Oxygen permeability properties Permeation properties of the membranes were investigated by gas chromatography (GC) method using a high-temperature oxygen permeation apparatus as shown in Fig. 1 . A silver paste was used as the sealant to fix the membrane disk onto a dense quartz tube and exposed an effective area of \u223c0.45 cm 2 at the sweep side for permeation study. The side wall was also covered with the paste to avoid radial contribution to the oxygen flux. Ambient air was applied as the oxygen rich side atmosphere and helium as the sweep gas to create an oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane. Helium also acts as the carrier gas to bring the permeated oxygen to a GC (Varian 3800) equipped with a 5 \u00c5 capillary molecule column and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for quantitatively oxygen concentration analysis. The oxygen permeation flux was calculated by [26] : (1) J O 2 ( mol \u2009 c m \u2212 2 \u2009 s \u2212 1 ) = C O 2 \u2212 C N 2 \u00d7 0.21 0.79 \u00d7 28 32 1 2 F S where C O and C N are the measured concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen in the gas on the sweep side, respectively (mol ml \u22121 ), F is the flow rate of the exit gas on the sweep side (ml s \u22121 ), and S is the membrane geometric surface area of the sweep side (cm 2 ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure and stability Fig. 2 shows the room-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns of Sr 1\u2212 x Y x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SYC, x = 0.0\u20130.8), SrCo 1\u2212 y Y y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SCY, y = 0.0\u20130.15), and Sr 1\u2212 x Y x Co 1\u2212 y Y y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (SYCY, x = y = 0.0\u20130.1) oxides, respectively, calcined from 1000 \u00b0C in air. A single-phase perovskite with the cubic lattice structure was observed for the SYC oxides with the Y 3+ doping level of x varied from 0.025 to 0.2. Characteristic diffraction peaks of Y 2 O 3 , although in very weak intensities, appeared at x = 0.45. It suggests the up-limit for the doping level of Y 3+ in the A-site of SYC is around x = 0.4. The shift of the corresponding diffraction peaks of the perovskite to the higher 2 \u03b8 suggests the shrinking of the cell volume with the increase of Y 3+ doping level at the A-site, which is coincided with the fact of smaller ionic radius of Y 3+ than Sr 2+ . As to the B-site doping, a cubic perovskite phase was also obtained at the Y 3+ doping level y up to 0.1. The oxide starts to display an oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite-related structure at y = 0.15. As to the oxides with their A- and B-sites both be Y 3+ doped (only the same doping level for the A- and B-sites was investigated in this study, i.e., x = y ), pure phase cubic perovkite was also obtained at x = y = 0.025 and 0.05. However, a further increase of the doping level to x = y = 0.075 resulted in the appearance of some brownmillerite impurity phase, although the main cubic perovskite structure was maintained. It is well-known the phase structure of perovskite is strongly composition related. A-site cation of the perovskite oxide ABO 3 is 12-coordinated with oxygen ions while the B-site cation is 6-coordinated with oxygen ions. The lattice structure of perovskite oxide is closely related with tolerance factor defined as [27] : t = ( 1 \u2212 x ) R A + x R \u2032 A + R O 2 ( ( 1 \u2212 y ) R B + y R \u2032 B + R O ) where R A ( R \u2032 A ) , R B ( R \u2032 B ) and R O represent the ionic radius of the A-site metal ion (12-coordination), the B-site cation (6-coordination), and the oxygen ion (1.40 \u00c5), respectively. The perovskite structure can be maintained typically at 0.75 \u2264 t \u2264 1.0. At other situations, the internal stress introduced from the mismatch of the A- and B-sites ions is so large that the perovskite could not be survived. For example, 2-H hexagonal BaNiO 3 -type structure is a typical distorted perovskite structure resulted from the too large of the tolerance factor. It is well known that cobalt ion in perovskite can take the oxidation states of 2+, 3+ and 4+. On the other hand, Co 3+ and Co 4+ can also take high and low spin states. As to the perovskite oxides of yttria doped SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 in this study, the tolerance factor t is determined by the relative concentrations of the various cobalt species and the doping level of Y 3+ . At low doping level of x , y < 0.1, the effect of Y 3+ itself on the tolerance factor is small. However, the Y 3+ doping level and its doping site could affect the oxidation and spin states of cobalt ion in the B-site, which then resulted in different lattice structure of the doped oxides. The ionic radius of Y 3+ (\u223c0.90 \u00c5) is much larger than cobalt ions at the B-site, while it is much smaller than Sr 2+ at the A-site (1.44 \u00c5) [28] . The mismatch between the ionic radius of A- and B-sites cations at high Y 3+ doping level can induce the oxygen vacancy ordering, this is the reason for the appearance of brownmillerite phase for SYCY0.075 and SYC0.10 oxides. Table 1 compares the lattice parameters of the SYC, SCY and SYCY oxides that show the cubic perovskite structure. The larger lattice parameter of SYCY than SYC and SCY suggests that the cobalt in SYCY lattice is prone to take a lower oxidation state or high spin state. A lower oxidation state means a higher concentration of oxygen vacancy, which is beneficial for the oxygen ionic conduction. In oxygen separation process, MIEC membrane is usually exposed to an oxygen partial pressure gradient and typically operated at 800\u2013950 \u00b0C. The high phase stability of the membrane material over the operational oxygen partial pressure and temperature ranges is critical for its long-term stability. Air is typically the oxygen-rich side atmosphere, while an inert gas is applied as the sweep gas to create an oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane. The stable phase structure of the MIEC oxide under inert gas atmosphere is then of great importance. The phase composition of SYC ( x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1), SCY ( y = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1), and SYCY ( x = y = 0.025, 0.05) under nitrogen atmosphere at high temperature was then investigated. Fig. 3 shows the XRD diffraction patterns of the corresponding oxides treated at 850 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h. The cubic perovskite was destroyed for all the investigated SYC and SCY oxides. It suggests that the perovskite structure could not be effectively stabilized simply by one-site Y 3+ doping under inert atmosphere. SYC0.025 displays mixed phases of oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite and 2-H hexagonal perovskite, while SYC0.05 mainly took the brownmillerite structure. Significant amount of Y 2 O 3 impurity phase is observed for SYC0.1. All the investigated B-site Y 3+ -doped SCY ( x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1) samples show mixed phases of 2-H hexagonal perovskite and brownmillerite after the nitrogen treatment. It is interesting that the SYCY0.025 displays an oxygen-vacancy-ordered brownmillerite structure, while cubic perovskite structure was sustained for SYCY0.05 oxide. It suggests that the simultaneous doping of Y 3+ into A- and B-sites of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 at certain concentration ( x = y = 0.05) can stabilize the cubic lattice structure also under reduced atmosphere. The enhanced phase stability of the cubic lattice structure via the double-site doping strategy is further supported by the long-term phase stability test of SYCY0.05 oxide. Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of SYCY0.05 oxide after treated at 850 \u00b0C for 100 h under flowing air, nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres. Single-phase cubic perovskite structure is all observed for SYCY0.05 after the long-term equilibrium under the air, oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres. As discussed previously, the phase structure of the perovskite is closely related with the tolerance factor, which is in turn determined by the relative concentration of the various cobalt ions. The change in the oxygen partial pressure of the surrounding atmosphere could result in the release/uptake of oxygen from/to the lattice of the oxide, consequently the change of the relative concentration of the various cobalt ions. Such a change may result in the transition of the lattice structure. O 2 -TPD is an effective technique to characterize the oxidation-state and spin-state change of cobalt in perovskite lattice during the oxygen desorption process. For the cobalt-based perovskite, the oxygen desorption peak at the intermediate temperature zone of 300\u2013700 \u00b0C is related with the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ (HS, LS), while the oxygen desorption peak at the temperature of >800 \u00b0C is related with the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . Fig. 5 shows the O 2 -TPD profiles of SYC0.05, SYC0.1, SCY0.1, and SYCY0.05 with the later three samples having the same total Y 3+ doping level of 0.1. Significant difference in the oxygen desorption properties was observed. Strong oxygen desorption peak at T > 800 \u00b0C was appeared for SYC0.1. It implies that a large amount of Co 3+ was reduced to Co 2+ during the process in SYC0.1 at high temperature. Since the big difference in the ionic radius of Co 3+ (0.61 \u00c5) and Co 2+ (0.745 \u00c5), a large variation of tolerance factor is expected. It then well explains destroy of the cubic perovskite phase of SYC0.1 after the nitrogen treatment. As shown in Fig. 5 , smaller amount of Y 3+ doping in the A-site ( x = 0.05 versus x = 0.1)) resulted in much less amount of oxygen desorption at the high temperature zone but larger amount of oxygen desorption at the low temperature zone. It suggests that cobalt has higher average oxidation state in SYC0.05 than in SYC0.1. The much smaller oxygen desorption at high temperature zone suggests the ionic radius change of cobalt in SYC0.05 is much less significant than that in SYC0.1. It then well explains the higher phase stability of SYC0.05 under reduced atmosphere with respect to SYC0.1. As to the B-site Y 3+ -doped SCY0.1 oxide, two successive oxygen desertion peaks were observed at the intermediate temperature of 400\u2013700 \u00b0C, suggesting the co-existence of high and low spin states of Co 4+ ion in the SCY0.1 oxide lattice under air atmosphere. For SYCY0.05 oxide, only one adsorption peak was observed between 300\u2013600 \u00b0C. As compared with SYC0.1, the oxygen desorption for the SCY0.1 and SYCY0.05 samples at the high temperature zone was greatly suppressed. The different behavior of SYCY0.05 and SCY0.1 oxides under nitrogen atmosphere suggests that not only the oxidation state but also the spin state of cobalt ion plays a significant role in the phase stability of the oxide. The doping of yttrium into the A-site of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 resulted in the suppressed displacement of the spin state of cobalt ion (Co 4+ , Co 3+ ), while the B-site yttria doping suppressed the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ under reduced atmosphere. The combined effect of the A- and B-sites doping resulted in the stabilization of cubic perovskite structure for double-site Y 3+ -doped SYCY0.05 oxide. 3.2 Electrical conductivity The oxygen permeability of MIEC membrane is closely related with its oxygen ionic and electronic conductivities. Under the bulk diffusion controlling, the oxygen permeation flux through a dense ceramic membrane at high temperature can be expressed as [29] : (2) J O 2 = \u2212 R T 4 2 F 2 L \u222b ln \u2009 P \u2032 O 2 ln \u2009 P \u2033 O 2 t ion t el \u03c3 total d [ ln \u2009 P O 2 ] where F is Faraday's constant, L is the membrane thickness, t ion is the ionic transference number, t el is the electronic transference number, \u03c3 total is the sum of oxygen ionic conductivity and electronic conductivity, P \u2032 O 2 and P \u2033 O 2 are the equivalent oxygen partial pressures of feed side and sweep side, respectively. In order to obtain high oxygen permeation flux, the membrane should possess high electronic and oxygen ionic conductivities over the operational temperature and oxygen partial pressure ranges. As to a typical oxygen separation process, one side of the membrane is exposed to air while the other side of the membrane is swept with an inert gas, such as helium. High electrical conductivity of the material in air and inert gas atmosphere is then of great importance. Shown in Fig. 6 (a) is the comparison of the electrical conductivity of SYC0.05, SYC0.1, SCY0.1 and SYCY0.05 between 300\u2013900 \u00b0C in air. As a whole, high electrical conductivity was observed for all four samples. SCY0.05 has the highest conductivity, followed by SYC0.1, SYCY0.05, and then SYC0.1. For the cobalt-based perovskite oxide, the electronic conductivity usually overwhelms the oxygen ionic conductivity; therefore, the measured electrical conductivity mainly reflects the electronic conductivity. The electronic conductivity of perovskite oxide is closely related with its phase structure and the characteristics of the variable metal ions at the B-site. The electron conduction is created by B-site lattice cations through strongly overlapping B\u2013O\u2013B bonds with a mechanism like the Zener double exchange process as shown below [30] : (3) B n + \u2013 O 2 \u2212 \u2013 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + \u2013 O \u2212 \u2013 B ( n + 1 ) + \u21d2 B ( n + 1 ) + \u2013 O 2 \u2212 \u2013 B n + The overlap of the oxygen 2p orbital with 3d orbital of the transition metal ions (cobalt ions) results in electronic conduction. Due to the fixed oxidation state of Y 3+ , it is impossible to join in the electronic conduction. Therefore, Y 3+ acts as a block for electronic conduction in perovskite. It then well explains the lower conductivity of SCY0.1 and SYCY0.05 than SYC0.05 and SYC0.1. Fig. 6 (b) illustrates the total conductivity of SYC0.05, SYC0.1, SCY0.1 and SYCY0.05 under nitrogen atmosphere. The conductivity of all samples is smaller than that in air, which suggests a p-type electronic conduction mechanism. SYCY0.05 reached the maximum conductivity of \u223c50 S cm \u22121 in nitrogen, while the other samples reduced to only \u223c10 S cm \u22121 . The higher conductivity of SYCY than SYC and SCY oxides in nitrogen can be interpreted by its higher phase stability under reduced atmosphere. Under nitrogen atmosphere, SYC and SCY changed to an oxygen vacancy-ordered brownmillerite or 2-H hexagonal phase, while the SYCY oxide still maintained the cubic peorvskite structure. The angle of the B\u2013O\u2013B bond is 180\u00b0 in the cubic structure of pervoskite, which ensures the easiest Zener exchange. The distortion of the lattice structure with the phase transition from cubic to brownmillerite and 2-H hexagonal resulted in the change of the bond angle, which made the electron hopping more difficult and then prohibited the electronic conduction. It suggests that SYCY0.05 might be a promising material for oxygen separation membrane. 3.3 Oxygen permeation properties The oxygen permeability of SYC ( x = 0.025\u20130.4), SCY ( y = 0.025\u20130.1) and SYCY ( x = y = 0.025\u20130.1) membranes was then comparably studied. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of oxygen permeation fluxes through the SYCY, SYC, and SCY membranes with the membrane thickness of 1 mm at the conditions of the ambient air as the oxygen rich side atmosphere and the helium at the flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 (STP) as the sweep side gas. The yttrium doping level was found to have significant impact on the oxygen permeability of the SYC membranes. SYC0.05 membrane possessed the highest flux, which reached \u223c1.10 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C. When the Y 3+ doping level is greater than 5 mol%, the oxygen permeation flux decreased with the increase of Y 3+ concentration. It is noted that the permeation fluxes of SYC0.1 is significantly lower than SYC0.05, although they al1 possess cubic perovskite phase and high electrical conductivities in air, as shown in Figs. 2 and 6 . It is well known that the oxygen permeability is closely related with the phase structure of the oxide. Cubic phase ensures the highest freedom for oxygen transportation and electronic hopping; therefore, it is the best lattice structure for oxygen permeating membrane. The perovskite structure was totally destroyed with the appearance of Y 2 O 3 impurity phase for SYC0.1 under the inert gas atmosphere, while the phase transition of SCY0.05 was less obvious. It is the cause for the higher permeation flux of SYC0.05 than SYC0.1 membrane. Since Y 3+ takes 3+ oxidation state, its doping into the A-site would result in the decrease of oxygen vacancy concentration, which may contribute additionally to the reduced oxygen permeation fluxes with increase of yttrium doping concentration at A-site. There was no significant difference on oxygen permeation fluxes among SCY membranes ( y = 0.025\u20130.1) because of no significant difference in phase behavior between the three materials. As a whole, SCY0.05 membrane shows slightly higher permeation fluxes than the other two membranes. The highest flux of all specimens was obtained by SYCY0.05 membrane, which showed a value of 1.35 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C, about 1.6 times that of SCY0.1 membrane and nine times that of SYC0.1 membrane at the same temperature. As shown in Figs. 2\u20134 , SYCY0.05 shows stable cubic perovskite phase structure under both air and nitrogen atmospheres, which may account for its outstanding oxygen permeability. The long-term oxygen permeation behaviors of SYCY0.05, SCY0.1 and SCY0.05 membranes at 850 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 8 . SYC0.05, instead of SYC0.1, was selected for this investigation since it has better phase stability. The fluxes of SYC0.05 and SCY0.1 membranes were found to decay with time quickly. The permeation flux of SCY0.1 membrane reached near zero after operation for \u223c65 h. The permeation flux reduced to less than 7.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 for SYC0.05 membrane after the operation of \u223c95 h. As discussed previously, the cubic perovskite is metastable for both SCY0.1 and SCY0.1 membranes under inert gas atmosphere. They slowly transformed to oxygen vacancy-ordered phase of brownmillerite at high temperatures, in which the oxygen ion is immobilized. Therefore, a decrease of the oxygen permeation flux with time was observed for SYC0.05 and SCY0.1 membranes. These two membranes experienced a gas leakage at the beginning of the oxygen permeation experiment, and the leakage increased steadily with time. After the long-term operation, serious cracks were clearly observed, which penetrated through the membranes. The crack formation was resulted from the internal stress created from phase structure transition. SYCY05 membrane showed stable permeation flux of 0.70 \u00b1 0.028 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 during the 130 h operation. Based on the results in Fig. 5 , it is attributed to its high phase stability. 4 Conclusions Yttrium was applied as the dopant and successfully introduced into the A-site and B-site of lattice of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 based oxide. Although a pure phase cubic perovskite was obtained in air through either A-site or B-site doping at proper amount, the phase structure was not stable under a more reduced atmosphere. The phase transition from cubic perovskite to 2-H hexagonal BaNiO 3 -type structure or oxygen-vacancy-ordered brownmillerite was observed in nitrogen. The double-site doping of Y 3+ into A- and B-sites of SrCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 at the proper amount (Sr 0.95 Y 0.05 Co 0.95 Y 0.05 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ), the cubic perovskite was effectively stabilized both in air and nitrogen. The membrane fabricated from SYCY0.05 displays high oxygen permeation fluxes of 1.35 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C. It suggests Sr 0.95 Y 0.05 Co 0.95 Y 0.05 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 is a potential candidate as ceramic membrane for oxygen separation from air.

        "abstract": "The performance of PrBaCo2O5+\u03b4 + Sm 0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (PrBC + SDC) composites as electrodes of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells is investigated. The effects of SDC content on the performance and properties of the electrodes, including thermal expansion, DC conductivity, oxygen desorption, area specific resistance (ASR) and cathodic overpotential are evaluated. The thermal expansion coefficient and electrical conductivity of the electrode decreases with an increase in SDC content. However, the electrical conductivity of a composite electrode containing 50 wt% SDC reaches 150 S cm-1 at 600 \u00b0C. Among the various electrodes under investigation, an electrode containing 30 wt% SDC exhibits superior electrochemical performance. A peak power density of approximately 1150 and 573 mW cm-2 is reached at 650 and 550 \u00b0C, respectively, for an anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte cell with the optimal composite electrode. The improved performance of a composite electrode containing 70 wt% PrBC and 30 wt% SDC is attributed to a reduction in the diffusion path of oxygen-ions within the electrode, which is a result of a three-dimensional oxygen-ion diffusion path in SDC and a one-dimensional diffusion path in PrBC. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A-site cation-ordered PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (PrBC) double perovskite oxide was synthesized and evaluated as the cathode of an intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) on a samarium-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte. The phase reaction between PrBC and SDC was weak even at 1100 \u00b0C. The oxygen reduction mechanism was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization. Over the intermediate-temperature range of 450\u2013700 \u00b0C, the electrode polarization resistance was mainly contributed from oxygen-ion transfer through the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface and electron charge transfer over the electrode surface. An area-specific resistance as low as \u223c0.4 \u03a9 cm 2 was measured at 600 \u00b0C in air, based on symmetric cell test. A thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cell with PrBC cathode was fabricated which delivered attractive peak power densities of 620 and 165 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 450 \u00b0C, respectively. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Impedance spectroscopy Mixed conductor PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 Cathode 1 Introduction Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have received tremendous attention recently due to their high-energy conversion efficiency, low emissions and excellent fuel flexibility. Traditional SOFCs are based on yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and typically operated at \u223c1000 \u00b0C to ensure affordable power density. Nowadays, there is great interest in reducing the operation temperature of SOFCs to the intermediate range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C for couple of benefits associated with such temperature reduction, for example versatile cell materials, prolonged lifetime, elegant sealing, and reduced fabrication cost [1,2] . However, rapid deterioration of cathode performance with the drop of operation temperature has become a major obstacle for the development of intermediate-temperature (IT)-SOFCs. Traditional SOFC cathodes are composed of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 perovskite-type oxide [3,4] , which is a pure electronic conductor under zero direct current passage with oxygen reduction strictly limited to the electrolyte\u2013electrode\u2013air triple-phase boundary (TPB). Recently, mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) oxides have received tremendous attention as potential cathodes of IT-SOFCs [5\u201315] . Since the oxygen-ion conduction can penetrate into the electrode bulk, the active sites for oxygen reduction are greatly extended; consequently, interfacial polarization is obviously improved at reduced temperatures by using a MIEC cathode. Most MIEC electrode materials have a perovskite-type lattice structure [8\u201315] , in which the oxygen-ion can migrate in all three dimensions. More recently, a new type of MIEC oxides, i.e. cation-ordered LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = Gd, Pr, Y, La, etc.), with two dimensional ion diffusion channels have attracted much interest [16\u201326] . The crystal structure of these oxides can be regarded as a layered crystal A\u2032A\u2033B 2 O 6 by doubling the unit cell of the standard perovskite structure, and consists of consecutive layers [BO 2 ]\u2013[A\u2033O]\u2013[BO 2 ]\u2013[A\u2032O \u03b4 ] stacked along the c -axis [21] . The transformation of a cubic perovskite to such a layered structure reduces the oxygen bonding strength in the A\u2032O \u03b4 layer and provides disorder-free channels for ion motion [16] , which remarkably enhances oxygen diffusivity and opens the possibility for developing a new class of materials suitable for SOFC cathodes. Among the various LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides, GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (GdBC) has been the most investigated [22\u201325] . Recently, its performance as a cathode of IT-SOFCs on proton-conducting BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3 electrolytes, Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) and yttria-stabilized zirconia has been explored [22\u201324] . By applying electrical conductivity relaxation techniques, Jacobson and co-workers demonstrated that bulk diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient for PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (PrBC) could be 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than the values reported for GdBC [21] , suggesting it may perform even better than GdBC as a cathode of IT-SOFCs. Their primary experimental results show that an area specific resistance (ASR) as low as \u223c0.15 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C can be achieved by applying a mixture of PrBC and Gd 2 O 3 -doped CeO 2 as the cathode on a Gd 2 O 3 -doped CeO 2 electrolyte [21] . To optimize the performance of a cathode, it is crucial to know the mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction. Up to now, such information is still lack in the literature regarding PrBC electrodes. In this study, PrBC was synthesized by a sol\u2013gel technique. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques have been applied to investigate its activity for oxygen reduction based on symmetric cell configuration. Complete cells with PrBC cathode on SDC electrolyte were also fabricated and evaluated. High performance was achieved. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis and cell fabrication Both PrBC oxide and SDC oxide powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [27,28] . The synthesis of PrBC, as an example, is described as follows. Pr(NO 3 ) 3 , Ba(NO 3 ) 2 and Co(NO 3 ) 2 , all in analytical grade, were applied as the raw materials of cations. Stoichiometric amounts of the above metal nitrates according to the molecular composition PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 were prepared into a mixed solution. EDTA-NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O and citric acid were added in sequence at a mole ratio of 1:1:2 for total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid under heating and stirring. A transparent gel was obtained by evaporating the water from the solution that was pre-fired to 250 \u00b0C to solidify the gel and followed by calcination at 950\u20131000 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to obtain the final product with the desired lattice structure. For fabricating symmetric cells, the as-prepared SDC powder was pressed into disk-shaped pellets using a 15 mm diameter stainless steel die under a hydraulic pressure of 10 MPa, followed by sintered at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The resulted dense pellets have a diameter of \u223c13.0 mm and thickness of \u223c1.0 mm. To prepare the electrode layers, PrBC oxide (well dispersed in a mixed solution of ethylene glycol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol) was symmetrically deposited onto both surfaces of the electrolytes by spray, followed by calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h. The obtained cells with symmetric PrBC electrodes were then used for EIS measurement. Anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte cells were fabricated by a dual dry pressing followed by sintered at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. A NiO + SDC mixture, prepared by mixing SDC powder and NiO in a 40/60 weight ratio, was pressed into pellets using a 15 mm stainless steel die. The proper amount of SDC powder, prepared by the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing method, was dispersed homogeneously over the open surface of the anode pellets inside the die and pressed again to form dual layer green pellets. These green cells were then sintered at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air to densify the electrolyte layer. The PrBC suspension was then spray deposited over the other electrolyte surface, followed by calcination at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The three-layered pellets were then used for I \u2013 V characterization. 2.2 Characterization The phase structure of synthesized powders was characterized with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The reactivity of PrBC with SDC was investigated by mixing and grinding the two powders in a 50/50 weight ratio and calcinated at various temperatures in the range of 900\u20131100 \u00b0C at 50 \u00b0C intervals. Microscopic features of the symmetric cells and the three-layered single cells were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi-X650). Both electrode surfaces of the symmetric cells were painted with a thin layer of silver to act as current collectors. The cell was then loaded into a quartz tube reactor with controllable atmosphere for electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurement using a Solartron 1260 Frequency Response Analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency used for EIS measurements ranged from 10 \u22121 \u201310 \u22122 to 10 5 \u201310 6 Hz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV. Samples were tested under open circuit voltage (OCV) condition. The oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere was varied between 0.04 and 1 atm by mixing O 2 with N 2 using mass flow controllers. The 3 vol.% water vapor was introduced by bubbling gas through a water bottle at 25 \u00b0C. The fuel cell test was performed in an in-lab constructed SOFC test station. The cell was sealed onto the top of a quartz tube with the cathode side and anode side flowing with dry or humidified air at 300 ml min \u22121 [STP] and hydrogen at 80 ml min \u22121 [STP], respectively. A Keithley 2420 source meter was used for I \u2013 V polarization tests. A four-terminal configuration was employed. The cell impedance under OCV condition was also measured. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Optimizing the firing temperature Fig. 1 shows the room-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns of the PrBC oxide prepared by the combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing method after calcination at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed well based on an orthorhombic structure, space group Pmmm , and the unit cell parameters a = 3.9041 \u00c5, b = 3.9048 \u00c5, c = 7.6358 \u00c5, which are in good agreement with literature results [21,29] . It suggests that the layered perovskite structure is well developed after the calcination. It is well known that SOFC electrode performance is closely related with many factors, such as its phase structure, its electrical conductivity, the phase reaction between electrode and electrolyte, and the physical connection between the electrode and electrolyte layers. The phase reaction between electrode and electrolyte may create an insulating interfacial layer and block oxygen transfer from the electrode to the electrolyte [30] while a poor connection between electrolyte and electrode layers would result in large contact resistance. The reactivity between PrBC and SDC was investigated by mixing them in powder state in a 50/50 weight ratio followed by calcination in air between 900 and 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h. The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns of the mixed powder after the calcinations are shown in Fig. 2 . Within the investigated temperature range, all the diffraction peaks could be indexed well based on a physical mixture of PrBC and SDC phases, and the unit cell parameters of SDC from 900 to 1000 \u00b0C are a 900 = 5.4370 \u00c5, a 950 = 5.4412 \u00c5, a 1000 = 5.4375 \u00c5, a 1050 = 5.4389 \u00c5 and a 1100 = 5.4367 \u00c5, which vary slightly at different temperature and are in good agreement with the value (JCPDS Card Number 75-0158). It suggests that no serious reaction between these two components. Since the high temperature calcinations result in electrode sintering, a lower firing temperature is preferred. However, a certain degree of solid-state reaction between the electrolyte and electrode layer is necessary to ensure a good connection. A firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C was adopted for the PrBC cathode layer. As shown in Fig. 3 are the cross-sectional morphologies of a complete cell ( Fig. 3 a) and a symmetric cell ( Fig. 3 b) with PrBC electrode(s), which were fabricated onto the electrolyte surface by firing at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h. It demonstrated that the PrBC electrode adhered to the electrolyte surface pretty well with no any delamitation observed. The well-developed connections between the two layers then ensure a low contact resistance. Furthermore, no observable interfacial layer between PrBC and SDC electrolyte was detected, agreeing well with the XRD results. In the following results, a firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C was adopted for fabricating the PrBC electrode layer. 3.2 Oxygen reduction mechanism The overall electrochemical reaction for oxygen reduction at a SOFC cathode can be simply described as follows: (1) 1 2 O 2 ( g ) + 2 e \u2212 = O 2 \u2212 In reality, it may involve many sub-steps such as gas diffusion, surface adsorption, dissociation, electron and ion charge transfer, and so on. It is of vital importance to have mechanistic and kinetic knowledge of the oxygen reduction at the cathode to improve cell performance. To get such information, complex impedance measurements of the single-phase PrBC electrode on the SDC electrolyte were collected every 50 \u00b0C in the temperature range from 450 to 700 \u00b0C. Experimental data in Nyquist plots and fitting results for a symmetrical PrBC/SDC/PrBC cell measured at open circuit in air are presented in Fig. 4 . In general, the spectra measured include a high-frequency induction tail ascribed to the device and connect leads. In the temperature range 450\u2013550 \u00b0C, two well-separated semi-circles were observed in the Nyquist plots. With increasing operating temperature, the high-frequency arc size decreased noticeably, and the arc was totally disappeared at 600 \u00b0C and higher. An additional arc at the low frequency range (1\u201310 \u22121 Hz) appeared when the operating temperature was elevated to 700 \u00b0C. It was found that the EIS data for a PrBC/SDC/PrBC symmetric cell can be fitted well to the equivalent circuit L \u2013 R b \u2013( R \u2013 C )\u2013( R 1 -QPE 1 )\u2013( R 2 -QPE 2 )\u2026( R i -QPE i ). The appearance of R \u2013 C impedance (made by a resistor R in parallel with capacitor) and the number of R i -QPE i impedances (made by a resistor R i in parallel with a constant phase element QPE i ) in series are dependent on operation temperature. The exact equivalent circuits adopted for fitting the EIS data at various temperatures are presented inside the Nyquist plots in Fig. 4 . The impedances of a symmetric cell may arise from both the electrodes and electrolyte. The electrolyte typically performs as an ideal resistor and displays only a dot in the Nyquist plots at high temperatures in the investigated frequency range of 10 6 \u201310 \u22122 Hz. However, with the decrease in operation temperature, a semi-circle associated with the oxide-ion diffusion around the grain boundary of the electrolyte also appeared in the high-frequency range. For example, Zhan et al. observed that the arc associated with the grain boundary ionic diffusion appeared at an operation temperature of 460 \u00b0C in the complex impedance plane plots [31] . It was found that the EIS data for the PrBC/SDC/PrBC symmetric cell at 450 \u00b0C can be fitted well to an equivalent circuit of L \u2013 R b \u2013( R \u2013 C )\u2013( R 1 -QPE 1 )\u2013( R 2 -QPE 2 )\u2013( R 3 -QPE 3 ). The semi-circle at the high-frequency range can be fitted based on the impedance of ( R \u2013 C ), composed of a resistor ( R ) in parallel with an ideal capacitor ( C ). The derived capacitance was found to be 2.11 \u00d7 10 \u22127 F cm \u22122 , which agrees with the reported values for grain boundaries of SDC electrolytes [32] . With higher operation temperature, the size of this arc decreased. It totally disappeared above 600 \u00b0C. The calculated Ea for this process is about 0.91 eV, similar to the reported activation energy for oxygen diffusion around SDC electrolyte grain boundaries [31,32] . This implies that the well-separated semi-circle in the EIS ultra-high-frequency range at 450\u2013600 \u00b0C may be associated with oxide-ion transfer through SDC electrolyte grain boundaries. The second semi-circles in the EIS data are contributed from oxygen reduction over the PrBC electrode. According to Adler et al. [33] , impedance at high and intermediate frequencies is related to ion and electron transfer at the electrode, electrolyte, and collector/electrode interfaces, while the impedance at low frequencies is associated with non-charge transfer, such as oxygen surface exchange and gas-phase diffusion inside and outside the electrode layer. Constant phase element (CPE) represents a non-ideal capacitor, and the associated CPE-Q parameter indicates the CPE\u2019s similarity to a true capacitor, for which CPE-Q = 1. To get more insight into the mechanism of oxygen reduction over the PrBC electrode, the capacitance and angular relaxation frequency f , which is an independent parameter of sample geometric characteristics and is a very use tool to identify the oxygen reduction process, were calculated based on the following equations [34] : (2) C i = ( R i Q i ) ( 1 / n i ) R i (3) f i = ( R i Q i ) \u2212 ( 1 / n i ) 2 \u03c0 Table 1 summarizes the fitting parameters as a function of temperature for PrBC/SDC/PrBC in air under zero dc bias conditions. It was observed that both f and capacitance for Arc1 were similar to the reported values for oxide-ion transfer through the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface [34] . Therefore, Arc1 is assigned to the impedance associated with oxide-ion charge transfer through the interface between PrBC and SDC. The polarization resistance associated with this process is about 1/3\u20132/3 that of the total electrode oxygen reduction, suggesting the oxygen-ion charge transfer through the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface played an important role in the overall oxygen reduction in the PrBC electrode. The angular relaxation frequency and capacitance of Arc2 and Arc3 is between 10 3 \u201310 \u22121 Hz and 10 \u22122 \u201310 \u22123 F cm \u22122 , respectively. Both are in the typical range for an electron charge transfer process [35] . The capacitance associated with the small arc (Arc4) in the low frequency range of the Nyquist plots (at operating temperature 700 \u00b0C) reaches 85 F cm \u22122 . Such a large capacitance is unlikely to be from any electrochemical process; it was therefore assigned to gas phase diffusion according to literature results [33,35] . To get more insight into the oxygen reduction at the cathode/electrolyte interface, a study of the influence of oxygen partial pressure and temperature on the electrode impedance was conducted. It is well known that different processes for oxygen reduction over mixed oxygen-ionic and electronic conducting electrodes have different relationships with the oxygen partial pressure. The most commonly used parameter to determine the rate-determining step in oxygen reduction process is m, which indicates the relation between the electrode resistance and oxygen partial pressure [34,35] , as expressed by Eq. (4) : (4) 1 R p = p O 2 m The m value is 1, 0.5 and 0.25 for the rate-determining step as the adsorption of molecular oxygen at the electrode surface (O 2 (g) \u21d4 O 2 , ads ), the dissociation of molecular oxygen to atomic oxygen (O 2 , ads \u21d4 2O ads ), and the electron transfer at the electrode/current-collector interface (O 2 , ads + 4e \u2212 +2V O oo \u21d4 2O O x ), respectively. Since the first semi-circle in EIS is contributed from the electrolyte, and the ionic conductivity of SDC is constant within the oxygen partial pressure of 0.04\u20131.0 atm, R b was set to be a constant in the whole oxygen partial pressure range investigated when fitting the EIS data. Representative profiles for p O 2 dependence of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 2 + R 3 are shown in Fig. 5 and the fitting results at 550 \u00b0C are listed in Table 2 . It is clear that R 1 did not have a monotonic dependence on oxygen partial pressure. In some cases, R 1 even slightly decreased with decreasing p O 2 . Such phenomena agree well with the characteristics of oxygen-ion transfer through the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface. Polarization resistance of the oxygen-ion transfer through the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface is closely related to oxygen-ionic conductivity of both the electrolyte and electrode. As mentioned above, the SDC electrolyte is independent of the oxygen partial pressure within the investigated pressure range (0.04\u20131 atm). The oxygen-ionic conductivity of a mixed conductor is closely related with the oxygen vacancy concentration in the oxide lattice since oxygen vacancies are the charge carrier of oxygen-ions. It is observed that lattice oxygen can be released from PrBC with decreasing oxygen partial pressure or increasing the temperature [19] . This implies that the oxygen-ionic conductivity may be improved with decreasing oxygen partial pressure. This explains the slight increase in R 1 with decreasing oxygen partial pressure at some temperatures. The polarization resistances R 2 and R 3 , associated with Arc2 and Arc3 appearing at intermediate frequency ranges, were found to be highly dependent on oxygen partial pressure. Both R 2 and R 3 decreased with increased oxygen partial pressure. The values obtained for m were 0.15\u20130.4 for both R 2 and R 3 at the investigated temperatures. R 2 + R 3 was found to be dependent on p O 2 with the value m \u223c 0.25. It suggests that both R 2 and R 3 are associated with electron transfer. In other word, the electron transfer process may be composed of two successive intermediate steps, showing comparable importance in the charge transfer process. At 700 \u00b0C, the additional arc (Arc4) in the low frequency range disappeared with increasing oxygen partial pressure. This suggests that the polarization resistance of this process quickly reduced with increasing oxygen partial pressure, which is in agreement with the behavior of a gas diffusion process. An increase of oxygen partial pressure results in a sufficient supply of oxygen to the electrode from the gas phase thereby effectively eliminating diffusion polarization resistance. To further support above oxygen reduction mechanism, some water vapor (3 vol.%) was introduced intentionally into the surrounding atmosphere while keeping the oxygen partial pressure constant. The influence of water on oxygen reduction may include: competitive adsorption of water over the active electrode sites for oxygen adsorption and blocking oxygen diffusion by adsorbing on the oxygen passage. Both of these processes could have a detrimental effect on oxygen reduction. On the other hand, water can also join in oxygen dissociation or charge transfer processes and alter the oxygen reduction route via the following reactions [36,37] : (5) H 2 O(g) \u21d4 H 2 O ad (6) 1 2 O 2 ( g ) \u21d4 O ad (7) H 2 O ad + O ad + 2e \u2212 \u21d4 2OH\u2032 ad (8) H 2 O(g) + O 2\u2212 \u21d4 2OH\u2032 ad (9) 2OH\u2032 ad \u21d4 O 2\u2212 + H 2 O ad (10) H 2 O ad \u21d4 H 2 O(g) Because of the high oxygen partial pressure, proton conductivity is reasonably assumed to be negligible. Therefore, the introduction of water vapor should have negligible effects on the bulk oxygen-ionic conductivity of the electrode. This implies that R 2 , which is associated with oxygen-ion charge transfer through the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface, should remain constant even with the introduction of water vapor. Fig. 6 shows typical EIS results for a symmetric cell measured at 550 \u00b0C, with and without the water vapor (3 vol.%) while fixing the oxygen partial pressure at 0.2 atm. The introduction of water vapor into the atmosphere resulted in a greater impedance, with lower temperatures showing more significant increments. Corresponding fitting results are listed in Table 3 . The R 1 value remained unchanged with the introduction of water vapor, which agrees well with the characteristics of oxygen transfer through the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface. The m value derived from the oxygen partial pressure dependence of R 2 + R 3 was still \u223c0.25 after the water vapor was introduced, as shown in Fig. 7 . This suggests that reduction mechanism was not altered by the introduction of water vapor. The impedance increment with water vapor could then be associated with competitive occupation of oxygen adsorption sites. Since water adsorption is more severe at lower temperatures, this then explains the increased effect of water vapor on polarization resistance of R 2 + R 3 at lower temperatures. Based on above analysis, it is clear that oxygen reduction over the PrBC cathode is mainly from the charge transfer process, including both oxygen-ion transfer from the electrode to the electrolyte layer across the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface and the electron transfer over the electrode surface. 3.3 Single cell performance Ni + SDC anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cells were fabricated to evaluate the performance of PrBC electrode in real fuel cell operation conditions. A firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C was adopted for the PrBC cathode layer. Fig. 8 a shows the I \u2013 V curves of the cell with an electrolyte thickness of \u223c20 \u03bcm at various temperatures between 450 and 650 \u00b0C while applying air as the cathode atmosphere and hydrogen as the anode fuel. High power densities were achieved. For example, at an operating temperature of 600 \u00b0C, the peak power density reached \u223c620 mW cm \u22122 , only modestly lower than that of a similar fuel cell with a perovskite-type BSCF cathode, which has shown outstanding cathode performance for oxygen reduction at reduced temperature [9] . Fig. 9 shows Nyquist plots for the corresponding EIS of a single cell under OCV condition at various operating temperatures. The polarization resistances presented here are a sum of the cathode and anode polarization resistances. As compared to the results from symmetric cell test, the electrode polarization resistances of the single cell under an asymmetric atmosphere of air versus hydrogen are even smaller. For example, the sum of the cathodic and anodic polarization resistance measured by the single cell is around 0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 while the polarization resistance measured by a symmetric cell configuration is 0.4 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C. This suggests that the cathode performance improved under these fuel cell operational conditions. Based on the results in Fig. 9 , the cell resistance at 600 \u00b0C was mainly due to ohmic loss of the electrolyte. It suggests that tailoring the thickness of electrolyte may lead to significantly improved cell performance. On the other hand, while decreasing the thickness of electrolyte, the extent of internal shorting in the cell should be considered [38] . Fig. 8 b and Fig. 9 c and d are I \u2013 V curves and corresponding EIS under OCV conditions at various temperatures when applying oxygen as the cathode atmosphere, respectively. Compared to the results by applying air as the cathode atmosphere, the performances improved only slightly when oxygen was selected. It further confirms that the main electrical loss is from the electrolyte. As compared to the fuel cell with a BSCF cathode [9] , deterioration in cell performance with decreasing temperature is much slower for the fuel cell with a PrBC cathode. For example, a reported peak power density of 1010 and 180 mW cm \u22122 was achieved for the cell with BSCF cathode at 600 and 445 \u00b0C, respectively [9] . It corresponds to a fivefold loss in power density when the temperature decreased from 600 to 450 \u00b0C. For a cell with a PrBC cathode, the corresponding peak power densities are 620 and 165 mW cm \u22122 , respectively, or a three fold reduction. The above results suggest that PrBC may be more suitable for low-temperature operation. Such characteristics agree well with the high oxygen activity of PrBC at reduced temperatures [21] . 4 Conclusions With an aim of developing high-performance intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells, the mixed ionic and electronic conducting A-site cation-ordered PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (PrBC) oxide has been investigated as the cathode on a samarium-doped ceria (SDC) electrolyte. The phase reaction between PrBC and SDC was demonstrated not serious even at 1100 \u00b0C. An EDTA\u2013citrate sol\u2013gel synthesis of the powder fired at 1000 \u00b0C can attach the cathode to the electrolyte surface very well without serious reactions between the two layers. Based on a symmetric configuration, an area specific polarization resistance of \u223c0.40 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C in air was achieved, which is comparable to literature results. It demonstrated the potential application of PrBC as a cathode for IT-SOFCs. The impendance\u2019s relationship to oxygen partial pressure and water vapor demonstrated that oxygen reduction on PrBC electrode was rate-determined mainly by oxygen-ion charge transfer through the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface and electron transfer over the electrode surface, which was possibly composed of two successive steps. Under single cell conditions, the main polarization resistance of the cell was from the electrolyte ohmic drop. Under optimal conditions, a peak power density of \u223c620 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C was achieved for an anode-supported cell using a PrBC cathode. Considering favorable oxygen reduction and electronic conductivity conditions, PrBC may be a highly promising cathode material for IT-SOFC based on doped ceria electrolytes.

The A-site cation excess in BSCF(1 + x) resulted in a lattice expansion and the creation of more active sites for oxygen reduction reaction due to the lowered valence states of the B-site ions and the increased oxygen vacancy concentration, which improved the oxygen adsorption process. On the other hand, the A-site excess could also result in higher resistances for oxygen adsorption (due to the formation of BaO and/or SrO impurities), and oxygen-ion transfer (by facilitating the solid-phase reaction between the cathode and the electrolyte).

        "abstract": "The effect of firing temperature on the microstructure and performance of PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathodes on Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 electrolytes fabricated by spray deposition-firing processes is systematically studied by various characterization techniques. The grain size, porosity and particle connection of the electrode as well as the physical contact between the PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 and Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 layers are influenced differently by the firing temperature. The area specific resistances (ASRs) of the various PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathodes are measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in both symmetrical two-electrode and three-electrode configurations. The lowest ASR and cathode overpotential are achieved at a firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C. Two main oxygen reduction reaction processes are proposed according to the oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electrode ASR. The rate-determining step is transmitted from a charge-transfer process at low firing temperatures to a non-charge-transfer process at high firing temperatures. A fuel cell with the PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathode fired at an optimal temperature of 1000 \u00b0C delivers the attractive peak power density of 835 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C, while this density is much lower for other firing temperatures. This result suggests the firing temperature of PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 electrodes should be carefully optimized for practical applications. Keywords Solid oxide fuel cells Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Cathode PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 Layered perovskite 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are considered as promising alternative electric power generation devices to current fire power plants because of their high-energy conversion efficiency, environmental friendliness, and excellent fuel flexibility [1] . Additionally, it has been well recognized that the wide spread of this attractive technology can be greatly accelerated if its operation temperature is lowered from the conventional temperature of around 1000 \u00b0C to intermediate temperatures of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C because of the multiple benefits including reduced fabrication and materials costs, prolonged lifetime, elegant sealing and versatile cell materials [2] . However, maintaining high cathodic performance and low electrolyte ohmic resistance at reduced operation temperature is a big challenge [3] . A typical SOFC cathode is composed of an electron-conducting La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) perovskite [4] , over which the oxygen reduction reaction is strictly limited to the triple-phase boundary (TPB) where the electrode, the electrolyte and the gas phase meet [5] . With a drop in operation temperature, the cathodic polarization resistance increases so sharply that LSM is no longer applicable at intermediate temperatures. Currently, there is considerable research activity on the potential of novel mixed ionic and electronic conductors as cathode materials of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) [6\u20139] . The mixed conductivity of such materials greatly extends the reaction sites, and consequently, these materials are expected to provide much higher electrode activity for oxygen reduction than LSM at reduced temperatures. Indeed, some materials, such as La x Sr 1\u2212 x Co y Fe 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [10\u201314] , Sm x Sr 1\u2212 x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 [15\u201317] and Ba x Sr 1\u2212 x Co y Fe 1\u2212 y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [18\u201322] perovskites, have been reported to have high electrochemical activity at temperatures as low as 600 \u00b0C. Recently, several research teams have reported the potential application of cation-ordered double-perovskite LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = Gd, Pr, Y, La, etc.) as cathodes of IT-SOFCs [23\u201335] . Based on a symmetric cell test, we have previously demonstrated that acceptable area specific resistance (ASR) can be achieved for PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (PrBC) cathodes at intermediate temperature [33] . With the further investigation into these cathode materials, however, some discrepancies appeared in the literature. The reported ASR of electrodes composed of the same material and tested under similar conditions could vary by several orders of magnitude; for example, the reported ASRs at 600 \u00b0C in air were in the wide range of 1.9\u20135.5 \u03a9 cm 2 for Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 [15,17] and 0.071\u20130.51 \u03a9 cm 2 for Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [18,36] . It is well known that in addition to the intrinsic properties of cathode materials, which depend on the material composition and lattice structure, their electrode performance is also closely related to their microstructure [11,37\u201339] and to the interfacial phase reaction between the electrode and electrolyte [40] . The discrepancy in electrode performance of the cathodes composed of the same material reported by different authors may be a result of their different electrode microstructures and/or different interfacial reaction behavior. To fabricate a cathode layer on an electrolyte surface, crystallized cathode material is first prepared by various methods, such as solid-state reaction, sol\u2013gel synthesis and many other advanced techniques, and then the cathode material is deposited onto the electrolyte surface and co-fired with the electrolyte layer at a high temperature. Previous works have shown that the ASR of many cathodes strongly depends on the firing temperature [11,37] . For example, Leng et al. reported that the electrode polarization resistance of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 electrodes fired at 975 \u00b0C is much lower than that of electrodes fired at other temperatures [11] . A detailed investigation into the effect of firing temperature on electrode performance would be helpful in optimizing the cell performance. In the present study, PrBC was applied as the cathode for a SOFC with Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) electrolyte. The influence of firing temperature on the microstructure and performance of a PrBC cathode was systematically studied and explained. The optimized firing temperature was developed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis and cell fabrication Both PrBC and SDC oxide powders were prepared by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process. Sm(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R., Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R., Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were applied as the raw materials to synthesize SDC. The synthesis of PrBC, for example, was performed as follows. Stoichiometric amounts of Pr(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R., Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), Ba(NO 3 ) 2 (A.R., Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R., Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), were prepared into a mixed solution, and then EDTA\u2013NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O and citric acid, serving as complexing agents, were added in sequence at a mole ratio for total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid of 1:1:2 under heating and stirring. After vaporizing the water from the solution via heating, a transparent gel was obtained. The gel was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C to form a black solid precursor, which was subsequently calcinated at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h in an air atmosphere to remove the carbon residue and to form the desired PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 phase. To measure the electrode performance, both a symmetric cell and a three-electrode configurations were adopted and tried, as shown in Fig. 1 . The SDC electrolyte pellets prepared for symmetric two-electrode and three-electrode cells were fabricated by dry pressing SDC powder (particle size, 22.9 nm) into disk-shaped pellets using stainless steel dies under hydraulic pressure of 200 MPa, followed by sintering at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The resulting dense pellets (relative density, 95.8%) have diameters of approximately 12 and 16 mm, respectively, for the two-electrode symmetric cells and the three-electrode cells. To prepare the electrode layers of symmetric cells, PrBC oxide was well dispersed in a mixed solution of ethylene glycol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol using a high-energy ball miller (Fritsch, Pulverisette 6) at the rotational speed of 400 rpm for 0.5 h; it was then symmetrically deposited onto both surfaces of the electrolyte by air-driven spray, followed by firing at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. To prepare a three-electrode cell, PrBC slurry was painted on one side of the SDC electrolyte to form a round electrode with an area of 0.26 cm 2 , which acts as a working electrode (WE), followed by firing at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. A Pt electrode, with the same shape and position as the WE, was painted on the other side of the SDC electrolyte pellet to act as a counter electrode (CE) followed by firing at 900 \u00b0C in air for 30 min. A silver (DAD-87, Shanghai Research Institute of Synthetic Resins, Shanghai, China) electrode was ringed around the counter electrode to act as a reference electrode (RE). The gap between the counter and the reference electrode was about 4 mm to prevent systematic errors in electrochemical measurements. Anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte dual-layer cells were prepared via dual dry pressing. Well mixed powders containing 60 wt% NiO (A.R., particle size, \u223c8 \u03bcm, Shudu Nano-Science Development Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China) and 40 wt% SDC were applied as anode starting materials, which were pressed into a green pellet using a 15-mm stainless steel die. The proper amount of SDC powder was dispersed homogeneously over the open surface of the green anode pellet inside the die and pressed again to form a dual-layer pellet. These green cells were then densified at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in an air atmosphere. The PrBC slurry was then spray-deposited over the electrolyte surface, followed by firing at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C in air for 2 h to form complete cells with an effective area of 0.48 cm 2 of the porous cathode layer. The three-layered pellets NiO + SDC|SDC|PrBC were then used for I \u2013 V characterization. 2.2 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using symmetric two-electrode and three-electrode configurations. Both the electrode surfaces of the symmetric cells and WE-surface of the three-electrode cells were painted with a thin layer of silver to act as current collectors. The cells were then loaded into a quartz tube reactor with controllable atmosphere. The ASR of the electrode was determined from its EIS using a Solartron 1260 Frequency Response Analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency used for EIS measurements ranged from 10 \u22121 to 10 5 Hz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV with no applied dc bias. The overall impedance data were collected with the ZPlot 2.9c software program and fitted by a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program using the ZView 2.9 software program. The oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere was varied between 0.04 and 1 atm by mixing O 2 with N 2 using mass flow controllers. The cathodic overpotential was measured using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat, which was operated via the Corrware 2.9c software. The polarization current density was varied from 0 to 1000 mA cm \u22122 in 10 mA cm \u22122 intervals. The IR drop, originating from the electrolyte and lead/contact resistances, was compensated to establish the IR-free I / E polarization curves. The performance of the cathode fired at different temperatures was also evaluated in complete cells in an in-lab constructed SOFC test station. The cell was sealed onto the top of a quartz tube with silver to act as a fuel cell reactor, which was put into a vertical split tube furnace. The cathode side and anode side were fed with ambient air and humidified hydrogen at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 , respectively. A thermocouple was inserted near the cathode surface for the temperature monitoring. A digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2420) was used for I \u2013 V polarization testing based on a four-terminal configuration. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Microstructure To fabricate PrBC cathodes on the SDC electrolytes, PrBC in suspension form was first spray-deposited onto the surface of a SDC disk, followed by high-temperature firing. The firing temperature may affect the microstructure of PrBC electrode by influencing its surface area, porosity, particle connection, and physical contact with the electrolyte layer; it may also induce an interfacial reaction between the SDC electrolyte and PrBC electrode layers. An insufficient porosity may create a serious concentration polarization, especially at high polarization current density. On the one hand, poor connection between electrode particles and/or poor physical contact between the electrolyte and electrode layers may hinder the charge transfer from particle to particle in the electrode, and/or from the electrode to the electrolyte; as a result, a large electrode polarization resistance is expected. On the other hand, the reduction in surface area because of sintering decreases the active sites for oxygen adsorption, dissociation and surface diffusion; as a result, an increase in electrode polarization resistance is expected. In addition, the phase reaction could create an interfacial phase, which may block the oxygen diffusion and lead to a sharp increase in the cell resistance. The microstructure of the PrBC electrodes fired at different temperatures was then examined by SEM observation. Fig. 2 shows the micrographs of the PrBC cathodes, both from the surface and cross-sectional views. For all firing temperatures, the electrodes show porous structures but with different levels of porosity, which are given in Table 1 . As a whole, a decrease in porosity with increasing firing temperature was observed. In particular, the electrode fired at 1100 \u00b0C was seriously sintered both at the surface and in the interior. The electrodes fired at 900 and 950 \u00b0C have high porosity and fine particle size; however, they also show relatively poor particle connections. With the increase of firing temperature to 1000 \u00b0C, the particle connection of the electrode improved noticeably, while the grain size increased only slightly. The average grain sizes are \u223c0.65, 0.72 and 0.75 \u03bcm for the electrodes fired at 900, 950 and 1000 \u00b0C, respectively. With further increases in firing temperature, however, an obvious increase in grain size with the temperature was also observed. The electrode fired at 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C had average grain sizes of \u223c1.64 and 2.62 \u03bcm, respectively, which are \u223c2.5 and 4 times that of the electrode fired at 900 \u00b0C. 3.2 Electrochemical performance The electrochemical performance of the various electrodes was first investigated by EIS in symmetric cell configuration. The typical EIS in the Nyquist plots of the various cells from firing at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 . All the EIS include a high-frequency induction tail and a depressed arc. Since there was no serious phase reaction between PrBC and SDC within the whole temperature range investigated, of 900\u20131100 \u00b0C [33] , the ohmic resistance of the cell is not discussed in the following section. It was found that the corresponding frequency point, such as 100 Hz, shifted to the left intersection of the real axis of EIS with increased cathode firing temperature, implying that the rate-determining step of oxygen reduction reaction kinetics likely changed with the increase of firing temperature. It is well known that the oxygen reaction over a mixed conducting electrode is complex, which may include several sub-steps, such as surface oxygen diffusion, adsorption, dissociation, and charge transfers (both oxygen ions and electrons) [41\u201343] . The firing temperature has different impacts on the above processes; consequently a change in the rate-determining step could happen with the change of firing temperature. To get more insight into the effect of firing temperature on the performance of PrBC electrode, EIS of the symmetric cells at different oxygen partial pressures were measured. Fig. 3 a\u2013e shows the EIS for the various PrBC cathodes in Nyquist plots, tested at 600 \u00b0C in atmosphere with oxygen partial pressure varied from 0.04 to 1 atm. The data were fitted to an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3 f. Here ( R E1 -CPE1) and ( R E2 -CPE2) represent the processes at high and low frequency, respectively. The constant phase element (CPE) represents a non-ideal capacitor, and the associated CPE-P parameter indicates the similarity of the CPE to a true capacitor, for which CPE-P = 1. The symbols in Fig. 3 a\u2013e represent the measured data, while the solid lines are fitted curves. Good agreement between the fitted curves and the observed impedance data was observed. This implies that the equivalent circuit is a reasonable approximation for fitting the experimental data. It is well accepted that different processes for oxygen reduction reaction over mixed ionic and electronic conducting electrodes have different levels of dependence on the oxygen partial pressure [43,44] . The most commonly used parameter to determine the step in the oxygen reduction process is m , which indicates the relationship between the polarization resistance and oxygen partial pressure, expressed as ln ( 1 / R ) = m \u2009 ln ( p O 2 ) . The m values give information about the type of oxygen species involved in the oxygen reduction reaction, as listed in Table 2 . Typically, m values between 0.5 and 1 indicate non-charge-transfer processes, which include oxygen diffusion at the gas\u2013cathode interface, adsorption\u2013desorption of oxygen, and the surface diffusion of adsorbed oxygen species. The value 0.25 should be observed for a charge-transfer process [43,44] , which could happen at the air\u2013electrode interface and electrode\u2013electrode interface. The value 0 indicates the ion charge transfer from the electrode to electrolyte [40] . It is often difficult to separate the two processes ( m = 0.25 and m = 0) in the EIS because they typically have similar characteristic frequency [45] . Fig. 4 shows oxygen partial pressure dependence of the fitted R E1 and R E2 . It can be observed that ln(1/ R E1 ) had a ln( p O 2 ) dependent slope of 0.18\u20130.28, which implies that this process is likely related to the charge-transfer process. On the other hand, ln(1/ R E2 ) had a ln( p O 2 ) dependent slope of 0.36\u20130.52, indicating the non-charge-transfer process. It should be pointed out that the concentration polarization arc did not appear under all conditions. This may due to the porosity of the PrBC cathode fired at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C is sufficient for free gas diffusion ( m = 1) under conditions without a polarization current. Fig. 5 presents the fitted R E1 and R E2 (derived from Fig. 3 ) of the PrBC cathode as a function of the firing temperature, measured in an air atmosphere. As a whole, R E1 decreased while R E2 increased with increasing temperature. R E1 decreased noticeably with firing temperature between 900 and 1000 \u00b0C, after which the decrement became much smaller with further increases in firing temperature. As to R E2 , which is related to the non-charge-transfer process, it increased only slightly with firing temperature between 900 and 1000 \u00b0C, while with further increases in firing temperature a sharp increase in R E2 was then observed. The SEM results, shown in Fig. 2 , can now be well explained as follows. At the temperature range of 900\u20131000 \u00b0C, the increase in firing temperature did not have a significant impact on the grain size (surface area) of the electrode, while it led to an obvious improvement of the electrode particle connection; as a result, the surface processes were not seriously affected but the charge-transfer process was greatly improved. At firing temperatures higher than 1000 \u00b0C, the particle connection was well developed, so that the further increase in firing temperature did not lead to an obvious change in R E1 ; however, significant sintering of the electrode appeared, which led to an obvious decrease in the surface area, and consequently the non-charge-transfer surface processes were greatly impaired. Table 3 summarizes the values of R E1 and R E2 (derived from Fig. 3 ) at various oxygen partial pressures. The same tendency was observed at all other oxygen partial pressures. The optimal firing temperature that leads to the minimum value of the sum of R E1 and R E2 was found to be around 1000 \u00b0C. Cathodic overpotential is an important factor representing electrode performance. Three-electrode cells were fabricated to evaluate the performance of the various electrodes under current polarization conditions. It is well known that the accuracy of three-electrode test is strongly dependent on the preparation technique. To ensure the high reliability of the data, the work electrode and the counter electrode should be as symmetric as possible, while the reference electrode should be as far from the electrode as possible. To ensure the high reliability of the three-electrode electrochemical test in the current study, the cell was first tested without DC polarization, and the data obtained were compared with those obtained from two-electrode symmetric cell tests. ASR values from the symmetric two-electrode and three-electrode cells for a cathode fired at different temperatures tested at 600 \u00b0C in air, for example, are plotted in Fig. 6 . A line with the slope of 1 was drawn for reference. Good agreement in polarization resistance is obtained in both configurations, suggesting the high reliability of the three-electrode cells in the current study. To evaluate the performance of the various electrodes under current polarization, a current was then introduced between the working electrode and the counter electrode. The IR-corrected Tafel plots for the PrBC cathode, as a function of cathode firing temperature tested at 600 \u00b0C in air, are shown in Fig. 7 . At the overpotential of \u22120.15 V, the cathode current density was found to be around 135, 150, 205, 135 and 100 mA cm \u22122 in air at cathode firing temperatures of 900, 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C, respectively. Although the graph indicates that three-electrode cells underestimate overpotential within several to 10%, the lowest cathode overpotential is achieved for the cathode fired at 1000 \u00b0C, in accordance with the EIS results. 3.3 Single cell performance Ni + SDC anode-supported thin-film SDC electrolyte fuel cells were fabricated to evaluate the performance of the PrBC electrode under real fuel cell operation conditions. Fig. 8 shows the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the cells with PrBC electrode being fired at various temperatures. The test was conducted at 650 \u00b0C with ambient air as the cathode atmosphere and humidified hydrogen with 80 ml min \u22121 as the anode fuel. Since the anodes and electrolyte were fabricated following an identical procedure, the anode and electrolyte resistances of the various cells were reasonably assumed to be the same, so the main contribution to the difference in cell performance is from the PrBC cathode. A maximum peak power density of 835 mW cm \u22122 was achieved from the cell with the PrBC cathode fired at 1000 \u00b0C, which was much higher than those of the cells with the cathode fired at other temperatures, where densities of 621, 667, 546 and 360 mW cm \u22122 at firing temperatures of 900, 950, 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C, respectively. It was observed that the dependence of the cell voltage on the current density of cells is basically a straight line except for the cathode fired at 1100 \u00b0C. This suggests that the porosity of the cathode fired at 900\u20131000 \u00b0C is sufficient for free gas diffusion. As to the PrBC cathode fired at 1100 \u00b0C, due to the significant sintering during the high-temperature firing, noticeable concentration polarization likely occurred at the high current density. 4 Conclusions The firing temperature has significant effects on the microstructure and, consequently, the electrode performance of PrBC cathode. It affects the surface area, porosity, particle size, and particle connection of PrBC electrodes differently. An increase in firing temperature led to an obvious increase in particle connection of the electrode between 900 and 1000 \u00b0C, while the particle size was not significantly affected within this temperature range. With further increases in firing temperature, however, the particle size increased appreciably. The porosity of the electrode decreased monotonically with increasing firing temperature; however, only the electrode fired at 1100 \u00b0C showed significant sintering. Within the full temperature range of 900\u20131100 \u00b0C, there was no obvious phase reaction between PrBC and SDC electrolyte based on the powder reaction test. The electrode performance was determined by the complicated effects of the firing temperature on the microstructure of the PrBC electrode. The cathode firing temperature should be carefully optimized to get maximum power output by applying the PrBC cathode. As a whole, an increase in the electrode polarization resistance associated with non-charge-transfer processes and a decrease in the electrode polarization resistance associated with charge-transfer processes was observed with increasing firing temperature. The optimal firing temperature is that at which the overall electrode polarization resistance reaches minimum, which was found to be around 1000 \u00b0C for PrBC electrodes in this study. A cell with PrBC electrodes fired at 1000 \u00b0C delivered a peak power density of 835 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C, which is more than double that of a similar cell with PrBC electrode fired at 1100 \u00b0C.

        "abstract": "A series of foreign oxides including CuO, ZnO, NiO, Co 2O 3 and Al 2O 3 were investigated as sintering aids to facilitate the densification of Ba 0.5Sr 0.5Co 0.8Fe 0.2O 3-anddelta; (BSCF) membranes for oxygen separation. The effects of these oxides on the phase structure, sintering behavior, electrical conductivity and oxygen permeability of BSCF oxide were systematically studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2-TPD), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), four-probe direct current (DC) conductivity and gas permeation measurements. The results showed that reactions between the membrane material and the foreign oxides took place at elevated temperatures. These oxides displayed different sintering behaviors during the sintering process of BSCF perovskite, with obvious improvement demonstrated in the case of CuO, minimal effects observed from ZnO, Co 2O 3 and NiO samples, and suppressing effects from Al 2O 3. The electrical conductivity was clearly increased by introducing Co 2O 3 as a sintering aid, yielding a maximum value of 70 S cm -1 at 900 \u00b0C. The oxygen permeation fluxes of the membrane samples from BSCF + NiO (5 wt.%) and BSCF + ZnO (5 wt.%) are comparable to those of pristine BSCF membranes, whereas the fluxes decreased noticeably when the other foreign oxides were introduced. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Two powder synthesis techniques, i.e. , a hydrothermal synthesis and an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process, were investigated. X-ray diffraction, BET surface area and laser particle size analysis demonstrate there is certain level of aggregation in both powders. However, it is more pronounced in powders obtained by the complexing process, and only the colloidal suspensions of powders prepared by hydrothermal synthesis are stable. SEM analysis of the green and sintered thin-film electrolytes demonstrate that the SDC electrolyte with powders prepared via the hydrothermal synthesis is denser. By optimizing the fabrication conditions, dense SDC electrolytes with a thickness of \u223c12 \u03bcm are successfully fabricated. The cells with SDC prepared from hydrothermal synthesis demonstrate open circuit voltages and power outputs similar to those of similar cells fabricated from other advanced techniques. Because of its simplicity and flexibility for anode substrate geometric shape, it turns out to be a promising technology to fabricate thin-film SDC electrolyte for solid-oxide fuel cell application.",

During the synthesis process, PEO acts as not only \"bridges\" to connect the TiO2 nanoparticles to the CNT surfaces but also as \"hosts\" to accommodate and stabilize the in situ generated TiO 2 particles. As the electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, such mesoporous 3D TiO2/CNT hybrids, demonstrate high Li storage capacity, superior rate performance and excellent long-term cycling stability. They exhibit a reversible specific capacity of 203 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and a stable capacity retention of 91 mA h g-1 at 8000 mA g-1 (47.6 C) over 100 cycles; they also retain approximately 90% (71 mA h g-1) of their initial discharge capacity after 900 cycles at an extremely high rate of 15,000 mA g-1 (89 C). This facile synthetic strategy to construct mesoporous 3D TiO2/CNT conductive hybrids provides a convenient route that efficiently assembles various inorganic oxide components on the CNTs' surfaces and enables the formation of heterogeneous nanostructures with novel functionalities.

        "abstract": "Sm x Sr 1 \u2212 x CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSCx) materials are promising cathodes for IT-SOFCs. The influence of Sm content in SSCx (0.2 \u2264 x \u2264 0.8) oxides on their oxygen nonstoichiometry, oxygen desorption, thermal expansion behavior, electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction is systematically studied by iodometric titration, oxygen-temperature programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD), dilatometer, four-probe DC conductivity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and three-electrode polarization test, respectively. Iodometric titration experiments demonstrate that the electrical charge neutrality compensation in SSCx proceeds preferably through the oxidation of cobalt ion for high Sm 3+ contents ( x \u2265 0.6). However, it proceeds mainly through the creation of oxygen vacancies at x \u2264 0.5. O 2 -TPD shows SSC5 possesses the highest oxygen desorption ability among the range of SSCx materials tested. The thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) are high between the transition temperature and 900 \u00b0C, showing values typically larger than 20 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 . All dense materials show high electrical conductivity with a maximum value of \u223c1885 S cm \u22121 for SSC6 in air, while SSC5 has the highest electrical conductivity in nitrogen. EIS analysis of porous electrodes demonstrates that SSC5 has the lowest area specific resistance (ASR) value (0.42 \u03a9 cm 2 ) at 600 \u00b0C.

Keywords Samarium strontium cobaltite Thermal expansion Electrical conductivity Oxygen vacancy concentration Electrode performance 1 Introduction Over the past several decades, there has been a major, international research effort to reduce the operating temperature of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to the low-to-intermediate temperature (LIT) range of 400\u2013800 \u00b0C [1\u20135] . This temperature range introduces several important benefits that may enhance the commercialization of SOFCs, including prolonged cell lifetime, improved flexibility in cell materials selection, reduced operation costs and reduced material costs. However, the LIT range also introduces a major challenge in maintaining a high cell power output. La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) is the state-of-the-art cathode for high-temperature SOFCs. This material is a pure electronic conductor with a low oxygen tracer diffusion coefficient of only 10 \u221215 \u201310 \u221216 cm 2 s \u22121 at 700 \u00b0C [6,7] . Application of LSM as a SOFCs electrode constricts the oxygen reduction reaction to the narrow region around the electrode\u2013electrolyte\u2013air triple phase boundary. A large polarization resistance has been observed for the LSM cathode at reduced temperatures, making it unsuitable for application at temperature lower than 700 \u00b0C. It is generally accepted that the improvement of cathode performance is critical to realize the practical application of LIT-SOFCs. Microstructure optimization and the development of new materials with high electrochemical activities for oxygen reduction are two general ways that the low-temperature electrochemical activity of SOFCs cathodes can be improved [8\u201311] . By introducing oxygen-ion diffusion paths into the electrode, the entire exposed electrode surface may become electrochemically active for oxygen reduction reactions. Consequently, a significant improvement in electrochemical activity at reduced temperatures would be expected. At present, considerable research efforts are being made towards the development of novel single-phase oxides with both high oxygen ionic conductivities and oxygen surface exchange kinetics as cathodes of LIT-SOFCs [12\u201318] . The doping strategy is the most frequently adopted method to tailor the properties and performance of mixed conductors. La x Sr 1 \u2212 x CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (LSC) perovskites are typically in the form of mixed conductors with high electronic and ionic conductivities at elevated temperatures [19,20] . These materials have been recently investigated as LIT-SOFCs electrodes [21\u201323] . The phase structure, phase stability, oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen ionic conductivity are all closely related to the lanthanum-to-strontium ratio in these oxides. The substitution of A-site or/and B-site cations in LSC has also been attempted to further improve the phase stability and/or electrode performance of these oxides at reduced temperatures [24\u201327] . The replacement of La in LSC by Sm with the development of Sm x Sr 1 \u2212 x CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSCx) perovskite composite oxides has been shown to effectively improve the surface activity of these materials [28] . Fukunaga et al. have recently measured the reaction model of the dense Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSC5) cathode and found that the surface exchange constants are one order of magnitude larger than the corresponding values for La 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3 [28] . Recently, SSCx oxides (SSC5 in particular) have received considerable attention as alternative cathodes for LIT-SOFCs. Their electrochemical performance for oxygen reduction on doped ceria, Sr- and Mg- doped LaGaO 3 , yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and proton-conducting BaCe 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 3 (BCS) electrolytes has been investigated [29\u201333] . To further improve electrode performance, the formation of composite electrodes with Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF), La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (LSCF), Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC), La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Ga 0.8 Mg 0.15 Co 0.05 O 3 (LSGMC5), BCS and Co 3 O 4 semiconductor have also been attempted [34\u201339] . Zhang and colleagues have demonstrated that anode-supported SOFCs with SSC5 + 25 wt.% SDC composite cathode and thin-film SDC electrolyte delivered a high peak power density of 0.75 W cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C when operating on hydrogen fuel [36] . Many research projects have investigated SSCx perovskites, with SSC5 gaining particular attention. However, a systematic investigation is still lacking into the effect of samarium doping content on the properties and electrochemical performances of SSCx materials as electrodes of LIT-SOFCs [32,40\u201344] . An ideal LIT-SOFCs cathode should meet several important requirements, including high electrical conductivity for efficient current collection, good thermal compatibility with other cell components to ensure a long operational stability, good chemical compatibility with the electrolyte to reduce interfacial polarization resistance, high surface activity towards oxygen reduction and bulk oxygen ionic conductivity to ensure low electrode polarization resistance. In this study, the effect of samarium content in SSCx (0.2 \u2264 x \u2264 0.8) on oxygen nonstoichiometry, thermal expansion behavior, electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity for oxygen reduction on samaria-doped ceria electrolyte was systematically studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication The composite oxides of SSCx (0.2 \u2264 x \u2264 0.8) and SDC electrolyte were synthesized using an ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process with Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 and Sm(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O as the cation sources. For a typical synthesis, the required amounts of metal nitrates were first prepared into a mixed solution. Subsequently, EDTA (in the form of EDTA-NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O) and then citric acid were added using a molar ratio of total metal ions to EDTA to citric acid of 1:1:2. NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O was used to adjust the pH value of the solution around 6. A transparent gel was obtained after the evaporation of excess water under heating. This gel was then pre-treated at 240 \u00b0C to form a solid precursor. And then precursor further was calcinated at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h in air and cooled naturally to room temperature to obtain the product with the target composition. Symmetric cells with the configuration of SSCx|SDC|SSCx configurations were used to measure the electrode performance by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). SDC electrolyte pellets were fabricated by dry pressing and sintering at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. For spray deposition, SSCx slurries were prepared by ball milling the SSCx powders at 400 rpm for 30 min with a solution composed of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol. The SSCx slurries were then painted on both surfaces of the SDC pellets in a symmetric configuration and subsequently calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. A three-electrode system was adopted for cathodic overpotential evaluation. SSCx slurries were painted onto one side of the SDC pellets and calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h to form a working electrode (WE) with a surface area of 0.26 cm 2 . Pt paste was painted on the other side of the SDC pellet, in a configuration that was symmetry with the WE, and sintered at 900 \u00b0C for 30 min to act as the counter electrode (CE). The silver reference electrode was pasted as a ring surrounding the CE. 2.2 Electrochemical characterization EIS measurements were carried out using an ac impedance method with an electrochemical workstation comprised of a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer and a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The applied frequency range was from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV under open-circuit conditions. The oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere during the EIS measurement was controlled at 0.04\u20131.0 atm by mixing O 2 and N 2 with mass flow controllers. The data were collected with the Z-Plot 2.9c software program and fitted by a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program within Z-View 2.9. The cathodic overpotential was measured using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat. The series resistance (IR) drop, originating from the electrolyte and lead/contact resistances, was compensated for by using the series resistance obtained from the EIS data to establish the IR-free I/E characteristics. 2.3 Other characterizations Crystal structures of the SSCx powders were analyzed by an ARL X\u2019TRA diffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The diffractometer was operated at 40 kV and 35 mA in the scanning 2 \u03b8 range of 20\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 with a step size of 0.02\u00b0. The micrographs of symmetrical cells from the cross-sectional view were observed by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-200). Oxygen-temperature programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) experiments were conducted on a home-constructed multi-purpose temperature-programmed apparatus [45] . About 0.15 g sample in the size of 40\u201360 meshes was placed into a U-type quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. Argon was introduced from one end of the tube at a flow rate of 15 ml min \u22121 [Standard Temperature and Pressure, STP] and the temperature was programmatically increased from room temperature to 900 \u00b0C. During this temperature increase, the oxygen in the oxide lattice was progressively released and carried on a stream of argon gas into a mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC-20, UK) for on-line oxygen concentration analysis. In some cases, the temperature was held at 900 \u00b0C for an adequate period of time to allow for the completion of the oxygen desorption process. The oxygen vacancy concentration of the fresh and desorbed SSC samples at room temperature was evaluated using iodometric method. Briefly, 0.1 g samples were dissolved in HCl solution under an inert gas atmosphere to prevent the oxidation of iodine ions by air. Subsequently, the solution was titrated with a standard thiosulfate solution. Details of this measurement process are available in a previous publication [45] . The thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of the SSCx pellets were measured in air using a Netzsch DIL 402C dilatometer in the temperature range from room temperature to 900 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The dilatometer was calibrated using a Netzsch quartz standard to yield an experimental error less than \u00b10.06 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 . The TECs of all samples in this study were calculated using the expression: (1) \u03b1 = d ( ( L 2 \u2212 L 1 ) / L 1 ) d T = d ( L 2 \u2212 L 1 ) L 1 \u22c5 d T where \u03b1 is the TEC and L 1 and L 2 are the initial and final gauge lengths, respectively. The electrical conductivity was measured using a four-probe DC conductivity technique. A bar with dimensions of 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm was sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. Then silver paste was painted on the endpoints of the rectangle and along the rectangular edges of the bar-shape pellets to form current and voltage electrodes. Silver wires were attached to the electrodes to act as current contacts (2 wires) and voltage contacts (2 wires). A current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage was detected by a digital source meter (Keithley 2420, USA) at intervals of 10 \u00b0C over the temperature range of 900\u2013300 \u00b0C under air and nitrogen atmospheres with a cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . At each temperature step, sufficient time was given for the conductivity to stabilize. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen desorption The electrochemical activity of an electrode for oxygen reduction is closely related to its oxygen vacancy concentration and oxygen desorption. The oxygen vacancy is the carrier of oxygen ion and can be created by a doping strategy. For an ideal A 3+ B 3+ O 3 -type perovskite oxide, the oxygen content is 3. The partial substitution of A 3+ by a cation with a lower oxidation state (e.g., M 2+ ) unbalances the local electrical charge neutrality. This can be compensated by the creation of an oxygen vacancy or the increase in the oxidation state of the B-site cation to a higher value as follows: (2) Route \u2009\u200a\u200a 1 : \u2009\u200a\u200a 2 M M x + O O x \u21c4 ABO 3 2 M \u2032 A + V O + 1 2 O 2 (3) Route \u2009 2 : \u2009\u200a\u200a M M x + B B x \u21c4 ABO 3 M \u2032 A + B B In SSCx, Sm and Sr take the fixed oxidation states of 3+ and 2+, respectively, while cobalt can take multiple valence states of 2+, 3+ and 4+. The partial substitution of Sm 3+ with Sr 2+ may lead to the creation of an oxygen vacancy via the compensation Route 1. This could also lead to the oxidation of cobalt ion to a higher valance state via the compensation Route 2. Improved oxygen ionic conductivity is expected with the increase in oxygen vacancy concentration, if no defect association appears. On the other hand, the surface activity is also closely related to the surface oxygen vacancy. The oxygen nonstoichiometry ( \u03b4 ) and average cobalt ion valence ( n ) for the various SSCx oxides prepared in air were determined by iodometric method, and the results of this analysis were summarized in Table 1 . Overall, an increase in \u03b4 with decreasing Sm content ( x ) was observed. The oxygen content is close to stoichiometry was observed for Sm 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSC8). The oxygen nonstoichiometry increased to 0.025 for Sm 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSC6) and reached 0.36 for Sm 0.2 Sr 0.8 CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSC2). The ratios ( R ) of the amount of doped strontium with different electrical charge neutrality compensations (i.e., through the creation of oxygen vacancy versus through the increase in cobalt oxidation state) were calculated and the results are shown in Table 1 . These results clearly demonstrate that the electrical charge neutrality compensation proceeded preferably through Route 2 at high Sm 3+ contents ( x \u2265 0.6), while the compensation was mainly through Route 1 at x \u2264 0.5. According to Jonker et al., Route 2 predominates at x > 0.5, while Route 1 may take over as x becomes less than 0.5 [46] . The present results agree reasonably well with these previous findings. In addition to the requirement of having a sufficient oxygen vacancy concentration, the electrode material should also possess high oxygen desorption ability to have high electro-catalytic activity for oxygen reduction. O 2 -TPD is an effective and facile technique for analyzing the bulk oxygen desorption and surface oxygen activity of an oxide, as well as for determining the reducibility of cobalt ions. The thermal reduction of cobalt ions to a lower state in the oxide lattice and a subsequent release of oxygen can be carried out using a programmatic increase of temperature in a flowing inert atmosphere. The shape of the O 2 -TPD profile is closely related to the bulk and surface properties of the sample. The O 2 -TPD profiles of all SSCx oxides over the temperature range of 200\u2013900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 1 . Two oxygen desorption peaks were observed in the profiles for x = 0.2\u20130.5. One peak appeared at 300 < T < 450 \u00b0C (denoted as \u03b1 oxygen) and is ascribed to the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ . With the increasing Sm content, a progressive change in the \u03b1 peak was observed. Interestingly, SSC4 had the largest \u03b1 peak area, while SSC6 and SSC8 had almost no \u03b1 peak. This suggests the Co 4+ cation had the highest stability in SSC6 and SSC8, while it was less stable in SSCx oxides with lower Sm 3+ contents. On the other hand, the \u03b1 peak shifted towards lower temperature with the increasing x and reached a minimum temperature at x = 0.5. The minimum desorption temperature of \u03b1 oxygen suggests that the lattice oxygen in SSC5 may have the highest desorption ability. The second peak appeared at 770 < T < 900 \u00b0C (denoted as \u03b2 oxygen) and is ascribed to the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . The desorption temperature of \u03b2 oxygen increased with increasing Sm content. For the SSC8 sample, the thermal reduction occurred mainly through the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ , instead of Co 4+ to Co 3+ . After the O 2 -TPD process, the obtained powders (identified as desorbed SSCx powders) were cooled to room temperature in an argon atmosphere. The oxygen vacancy concentration and the average valence state of the cobalt ions were then determined by iodometric method (also shown in Table 1 ). Compared with the fresh SSCx powders, the oxygen vacancy concentrations of the desorbed SSCx samples were increased and the average valence states of the cobalt ions were all smaller than +3, suggesting the thermal reduction of cobalt ions. 3.2 Thermal expansion The large variation in oxygen nonstoichiometry during the thermal process may have a significant impact on the thermal expansion behavior of the oxides. Thermal expansion data obtained upon heating for SSCx compositions are given in Fig. 2 . The thermal expansion behavior of the SSC pellets with x = 0.2\u20130.6 was relatively abnormal, yielding nonlinear results for all samples and with transitions occurring between 420 and 590 \u00b0C. The appearance of the transition points can be ascribed to the loss of lattice oxygen with the formation of an oxygen vacancy or the spin state transition of the cobalt ions. No obvious transition at the intermediate temperature range was observed for SSC8. This is consistent with the O 2 -TPD results, in which no \u03b1 peak appeared in the same temperature range of the profile. Therefore, the transition is more likely related to oxygen release from the lattice. The TEC is defined as the slope of the dilatometric curve. Corresponding values for the TEC over the temperature range for the SSCx oxides are listed in Table 2 . SSC8 had a TEC of 21.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 in the temperature range of 200\u2013900 \u00b0C. Overall, there was no direct correlation between the compositions and the TECs of the SSCx samples. For x = 0.2\u20130.6, in the low temperature range (200\u2013Tt \u00b0C, Tt: transition temperature), the dilatometric behavior was linear and all of the TECs were lower than 20 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 . However, between Tt and 900 \u00b0C, the TEC values were all higher than 20 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 for various SSCx oxides, which are remarkably larger values compared to those in the low temperature range. The expansion behavior for these two temperature ranges can be attributed to two different mechanisms. In the low temperature range, the intrinsic thermal expansion is mainly due to atomic vibrations of the lattice associated with the surrounding temperature. In the high temperature range, in addition to the intrinsic thermal expansion, another contribution to the volume expansion is caused by oxygen loss from the structure with the creation of oxygen vacancies. This mechanism is commonly called chemical-induced expansion. The thermal reductions of the Co cation from the high valence state of Co 4+ to the lower trivalent state of Co 3+ or Co 3+ to Co 2+ can be described according to the defect reaction as follows: (4) 2 C o Co + O O x \u21d4 2 C o Co x + V O + 1 2 O 2 (5) 2 C o Co x + O O x \u21d4 2 C o \u2032 Co + V O + 1 2 O 2 As the temperature increases, more oxygen vacancies are formed and the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ or Co 3+ to Co 2+ takes place. In this study, the thermal reduction of cobalt ions led to an increase in the ionic radius of the cobalt ions. In addition, the reductions cause a decrease in the length of B\u2013O bond according to Pauling's second rule, and hence the size of the BO 6 octahedra increases, thus enhancing the lattice expansion [47] . 3.3 Electrical conductivity As a potential SOFCs cathode, it is preferable for the electrical conductivity of the material to be above 100 S cm \u22121 [48] . Insufficient electrical conductivity may introduce large transfer resistance, especially under a large polarization current. Owing to the co-presence of electronic holes and oxygen vacancies, SSCx oxides possess mixed electronic and ionic conductivities at elevated temperatures. However, the electronic conductivity is much larger than the ionic conductivity (by more than three orders of magnitude). Therefore, the values measured using the four-probe DC conductivity technique can be treated solely as the electronic conductivity. Fig. 3 shows the electrical conductivity of SSCx oxides in air and nitrogen atmospheres between 300 and 900 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 3 a, under an air atmosphere, SSC6 had the highest electrical conductivity. This was followed by SSC5, which showed a conductivity value slightly lower than for SSC6. For example, the maximum values were 1885 and 1731 S cm \u22121 for SSC6 and SSC5, respectively. SSC8 showed the lowest electrical conductivity among the others SSCx materials analyzed with a maximum value of only 370 S cm \u22121 . For all SSCx oxides under investigation, except SSC8, the electrical conductivity was found to decrease gradually with increasing temperature, which could result from the metallic-like conduction behavior of the oxides in air. On the other hand, two electron holes were eliminated for each oxygen ion leaving the lattice (as shown in Eq. (4) ), resulting in a reduction in electronic conductivity. Thus the decrease in oxygen stoichimetry (3 \u2212 \u03b4 ) with increasing temperature can also produce the decrease in conductivity due to the reduction in electron hole concentration. For SSC8, the electrical conductivity first increased with temperature, reaching a maximum value at 630 \u00b0C, and then decreased with further increases in temperature. This unique behavior in electrical conductivity is obviously closely related to the different oxygen desorption properties observed for SSC8 compared to the other SSCx materials analyzed, as demonstrated by O 2 -TPD. Fig. 3 b shows the electrical conductivity of the various SSCx oxides in a nitrogen atmosphere. A reduced conductivity was observed in nitrogen compared to the results found in air. This indicates that a P-type electron conducting mechanism occurred (i.e., the electron conduction was created by an electron hopping between Co 3+ and Co 4+ ), which agrees well with the >3+ average oxidation states of the cobalt ions in SSCx oxides when under an air atmosphere, as shown in Table 1 . The electrical conductivity of all SSCx oxides in a nitrogen atmosphere gradually increased with temperature. SSC5 showed the highest conductivity among the analyzed SSCx materials with a value of 176 and 436 S cm \u22121 at 300 and 900 \u00b0C, respectively. Overall, all of the investigated SSCx oxides ( x = 0.2\u20130.8) demonstrated sufficient electrical conductivities for their application as SOFC electrodes. 3.4 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy The oxygen reduction performances of the various SSCx electrodes on SDC electrolytes were first investigated by EIS analysis based on a symmetric cell configuration. To gain a reasonable comparison, all of the SDC electrolytes were polished to the same thickness of \u223c0.6 mm, and the electrodes were controlled to the same thickness of 28 \u03bcm by adjusting the spray time. In addition, all of the symmetric cells were fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to minimize the difference in electrode microstructure for various SSCx materials. Fig. 4 shows typical SEM micrographs of the SSCx electrodes (SSC6 and SSC5) on the SDC electrolyte from a cross-sectional view. The electrodes showed similar microstructure and thicknesses as expected. The oxygen electrochemical reduction performance of the electrode, including the gas phase diffusion, surface adsorption, dissociation, charge transfer and incorporation of oxygen ion into the electrode, can be quantitatively evaluated by the area specific resistance (ASR) as follows: (6) ASR \u2009 ( \u03a9 \u2009 c m 2 ) = R cathode \u00d7 A 2 ( symmetry ) where R cathode is the polarization resistance of the electrode, which can be calculated from the distance between the low-frequency and the high-frequency intercepts of the semicircle at the real axis from the EIS, and A is the effective area of the electrode. The ASR values of the SSCx electrodes as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 5 . In this analysis, SSC5 showed the best electrode performance of the materials studied, yielding an ASR of only 0.42 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C. Beak et al. have reported that an SSC5 electrode sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for 1 h had a high ASR of 0.87 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C [48] , which is more than two times the value of our result. A possible explanation for this difference is that the lower sintering temperature utilized in our study ensured a higher electrode porosity and weaker interfacial reaction between the electrode and the SDC electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4 , the electrodes were highly porous, and no obvious interfacial layer was formed between the SSCx electrodes and the SDC electrolyte. Based on the Arrhenius equation, the activation energies of the oxygen electrochemical reduction for the various SSCx electrodes were also calculated, yielding values of 1.33, 1.17, 1.14, 1.38 and 1.36 eV for x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8, respectively. The lowest Ea observed for SSC5, among the SSCx series, has also been reported by other researchers for the SDC electrolyte [48] . Impedance measurements were performed as a function of oxygen partial pressure to study the oxygen reduction reaction that occurred on the SSC5 electrode. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist impedance curves of the SSC5 electrode measured at 600 \u00b0C at various oxygen partial pressures. The electrode polarization resistance (Rp) value increased from 0.28 to 0.61 \u03a9 cm 2 with the decrease of P O 2 from 1.0 to 0.04 atm. No additional impedance arc was found at the low frequency range, even under the 0.04 atm oxygen partial pressure. This suggests the absence of concentration polarization resistance owing to the well-constructed microstructure of the electrode (as shown in Fig. 4 ) The observed, separable impedance arcs at low and high frequencies suggest that at least two different electrode processes limited the oxygen reduction reaction. However, it is difficult to separate surface and bulk processes because the processes on porous electrodes are complicated [49] . It is worthy to be further studied to investigate the rate-limiting step of porous SSC5 cathode. 3.5 Cathodic overpotential Cathodic overpotential may be a good parameter for describing the performance of an electrode in a real fuel cell under polarization. The IR-corrected Tafel plots for the SSC cathode at 600 \u00b0C in air are shown in Fig. 7 . The exchange current density ( i 0 ) which directly reflects the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity can be obtained from the Butler\u2013Volmer equation: (8) i = i 0 exp \u03b1 a F \u03b7 R T \u2212 exp \u2212 \u03b1 c F \u03b7 R T where n is the total number of transferred electrons passed in the reaction, \u03b7 is the cathodic overpotential, \u03b1 c is the cathodic coefficient, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. In a high-field overpotential, the anodic reaction is reasonably ignored and i 0 can be obtained from the y -intercept of a plot of log i versus \u03b7 . Thus, i 0 can be calculated according to the following equation: (9) Log \u2009 i = Log \u2009 i 0 \u2212 \u03b1 c n F 2.303 R T \u03b7 The value of \u03b1 c can be calculated by: (10) \u03b1 c = \u03b3 \u03c5 + r \u03b2 where \u03b3 is the number of electrons transferred before the rate limiting step, r is the number of electrons transferred during the rate limiting step and \u03b2 is the symmetry coefficient (normally assumed to be 0.5). SSC2 was found to have the smallest i 0 , yielding a value of 8 mA cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C, while SSC5 showed the highest i 0 of 60 mA cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. The i 0 values of the SSCx oxides with x = 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 were similar, yielding values of approximately 40 mA cm \u22122 . This trend agrees well with the ASRs obtained based on the symmetric two-electrode test. The cathodic overpotential of the SSC5 cathode at various temperatures in air was further measured and the IR-corrected Tafel plots at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 8 . As expected, the cathodic overpotential decreased with temperature, suggesting that the electrochemical activity was improved with operation temperature. The polarization overpotential was \u2212200 mV for the SSC5 electrode with the current densities of \u2212243, \u2212134, \u221256 and \u221227 mA cm \u22122 at 650, 600, 550 and 500 \u00b0C in air, respectively. However, the i 0 decreased from 90 to 19 mA cm \u22122 when the temperature was decreased from 650 and 500 \u00b0C. 4 Conclusions The Sm content had a significant effect on the oxygen nonstoichiometry, oxygen desorption, thermal expansion behavior, electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity for the oxygen reduction of Sm x Sr 1 \u2212 x CoO 3 \u2212 \u03b4 (SSCx, 0.2 \u2264 x \u2264 0.8) oxides. Because of the higher valence state of Sm 3+ than Sr 2+ , the substitution of Sm 3+ with Sr 2+ would lead to an increase in the oxidation state of the cobalt ion or the creation of an oxygen vacancy. Iodometric titration analysis demonstrated that the former predominated at high samarium contents ( x \u2265 0.6) and the latter took over at low samarium content ( x \u2264 0.5). O 2 -TPD analysis demonstrated that the SSC5 had the highest oxygen desorption ability among all of the SSCx compositions studied. The formation of oxygen vacancies and the increase in cobalt oxidation state are sufficient to explain the transition in the dilatomertric curves at 420\u2013590 \u00b0C of SSCx with x = 0.2\u20130.6. Chemical-induced expansion was the source of the high TECs found for the SSCx, which yielded values typically larger than 20 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 between the transition temperature and 900 \u00b0C. All SSCx oxides showed high electrical conductivity values that are suitable for fuel cell electrode applications. In particular, dense SSC6 and SSC5 had the highest electrical conductivities in air and nitrogen, yielding values of 1885 and 436 S cm \u22121 , respectively. In addition, SSC5 showed the best electrochemical performance, with area specific resistance as low as 0. 42 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C and a low activation energy of 1.16 eV. SSC5 also had the highest exchange current density, with a value of 60 mA cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. SSC5 was found to be the optimal material among the SSCx series for an oxygen reduction electrode on doped ceria electrolytes.

Abstract Dimethyl ether (DME)-oxygen mixture as the fuel of an anode-supported SOFC with a conventional nickel-cermet anode for operating at reduced temperatures is systematically investigated.

Maximum methane selectivity is reached at 700 \u00b0C. Cell performance is observed between 600 and 800 \u00b0C. Peak power densities of approximately 400 and 1400 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively, are reached for the cell operating on DME-O 2 mixture. These values are comparable to those obtained using hydrogen as a fuel, and cell performance is reasonably stable at 700 \u00b0C for a test period of 340 min. SEM results demonstrate that the cell maintains good geometric integrity without any delimitation of respective layer after the stability test, and EDX results show that carbon deposition occurrs only at the outer surface of the anode. O 2 -TPO analysis shows that carbon deposition over the Ni-YSZ operating on DME is greatly suppressed in the presence of oxygen. Internal partial oxidation may be a practical way to achieve high cell performance at intermediate-temperatures for SOFCs operating on DME fuel. Keywords Dimethyl ether Solid-oxide fuel cells Carbon deposition Anode Partial oxidation 1 Introduction The development of clean fuels and efficient energy conversion technologies is critical for a sustainable future. Dimethyl ether (DME) has the advantages of a high H/C ratio, high energy density, no toxicity and ease of storage and transportation. It can be produced from a wide range of primary fuels including natural gas, coal and biomass [1\u20133] . As a clean fuel, it is free of sulfur, heavy metals and other impurities. In addition, it has similar physical properties to those of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); therefore, the existing liquid propane infrastructure can be easily transformed to handle, transport and store DME. It is believed that DME will play an important role in the energy supply systems of the future [4\u20136] . Fuel cells are a type of electrochemical energy conversion device with high efficiency and low emissions [7\u20139] , which meet the requirements for future power sources. The use of DME in fuel cells is highly attractive because it combines the benefits of the environmental friendliness of DME fuel and the high efficiency of fuel cells [10\u201317] . Currently, most of the attention on DME in fuel cells has focused on the development of effective catalysts that produce hydrogen from DME, and some progress has been made in this regard [18\u201324] . Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are a type of high-temperature fuel cell that is fuel-flexible [25\u201330] . DME can be potentially directly fed into the anode of an SOFC without requiring an external reforming process [31,32] . This greatly simplifies fuel cell systems and increases overall fuel efficiency. Recently, DME as a fuel of SOFCs has attracted the attention of researchers [33\u201336] . In principle, SOFCs can operate on any fuel that is combustible. Cells with conventional nickel cermet anodes frequently encounter problems of low power output at intermediate temperatures and severe coke formation when operating directly on hydrocarbon fuels. In a previous study, we demonstrated that a state-of-the-art Ni-(Y 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (YSZ) cermet anode catalyzed DME decomposition reactions and led to heavy carbon deposition [33] . Therefore, it is impractical to operate conventional SOFCs directly on pure DME fuel. Internal reforming can convert hydrocarbons to synthesis gas, which is a mixture of CO and H 2 . Although the electro-oxidation rate of CO over nickel cermet anode is much slower than H 2 , it was found that the cell delivers a similar power output when operating on a CO\u2013H 2 gas mixture and pure hydrogen [37,38] because the water shift reaction occurs easily on the anode (H 2 O + CO = CO 2 + H 2 ). Furthermore, internal reforming can suppress coke formation over the fuel cell anode due to the increased O to C molar ratio. Previously, we demonstrated that the carbon deposition can be effectively suppressed at a temperature higher than 800 \u00b0C by introducing CO 2 , which is the deep oxidation product of DME, into the fuel gas as a reforming gas. This is due to the high catalytic activity of the cermet anode for the CO 2 reforming of DME and methane (a decomposition product of DME) and the gasification of deposited solid carbon. However, the catalytic activity of the Ni-YSZ cermet for those three reactions was substantially reduced at a temperature lower than 800 \u00b0C and, as a result, coke formation on the anode became a serious problem again [33] . This implies that the operation of a cell on DME-CO 2 gas mixtures is possible only in a narrow temperature window of 800\u2013850 \u00b0C. At present, it is generally accepted that the wide implementation of SOFCs technology requires a decrease of the operation temperature to an intermediate temperature range of 500\u2013800 \u00b0C. Compared to CO 2 , O 2 is much more reactive and oxidative, which may be more effective in suppressing coke formation kinetically when operating on DME fuel, especially at a reduced temperature. By operating on a DME-O 2 gas mixture, the operating temperature can be further reduced below 800 \u00b0C. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that some catalysts possess high activity for DME partial oxidation at intermediate temperatures of 600\u2013750 \u00b0C [22,23] . Therefore, it is possible to further reduce the operation temperature of SOFCs on DME fuel to lower than 800 \u00b0C through internal partial oxidation. The primary results reported by Murray strongly support this assumption [32] . In this study, we systematically investigated the potential operation of SOFCs with a conventional nickel cermet anode on DME-O 2 gas mixtures through internal partial oxidation. Cell performance with hydrogen fuel and the DME-O 2 (DME:O 2 = 2:1, volume ratio) gas mixture was comparatively studied at a temperature range of 600\u2013800 \u00b0C. We paid special attention to the effect of oxygen on suppressing coke formation on the nickel cermet. 2 Experimental The electrolyte material (Y 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (YSZ) was purchased from Tosoh (Japan), and the composite cathode materials, including Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 (BSCF) and Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) oxide powders, were synthesized via a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [39] . The SDC oxide, which was used as a barrier layer, was obtained using the hydrothermal synthesis method [40] . This study used anode-supported cells with a configuration of (anode) Ni-YSZ | YSZ | SDC | BSCF-SDC (cathode). To fabricate the single cell, anode powders were first prepared by mixing NiO (Chengdu Shudu Nano-Science Co., Ltd., China) and YSZ in a weight ratio of 60:40, which was used for the fabrication of anode substrates by tape casting. After firing at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to remove organic solvents and create sufficient mechanical strength, the YSZ electrolyte layer was deposited onto the anode substrates via the wet powder spraying method. The NiO-YSZ | YSZ green disks were sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air, and then the SDC thin-film barrier layer was deposited onto the sintered YSZ electrolyte using the wet powder spraying method and fired at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h. Finally, the BSCF-SDC (BSCF: SDC = 70: 30, by weight) composite cathode slurries were sprayed over the central surface of the SDC barrier layer via the spraying technique with a geometric surface area of 0.48 cm 2 . It was then fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. The partial oxidation of DME with and without the sintered Ni-YSZ cermet anode as a catalyst (at 1400 \u00b0C) was performed in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c8 mm. Approximately 0.2 g of Ni-YSZ catalyst particles (after sintering at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h), with a particle size of 40\u201360 mesh and that were diluted in 0.4 g inactive silica sand, were packed into the middle of the reactor to create a catalyst bed height of \u223c10 mm. For the blank reaction, 0.6 g inactive silica sand was put into the reactor to allow for a similar pressure drop as that of the catalytic test. A K-type thermocouple was inserted into the catalyst bed (or the quartz sand bed) to monitor and control the reaction temperature. Prior to the catalytic test, the catalyst was reduced by pure hydrogen at a flow rate of 40 mL min \u22121 [STP: standard temperature and pressure] at 850 \u00b0C for 1 h. After purging with argon gas for 10 min, the reactant gases, which were composed of DME, O 2 and He diluting gas, were fed into the reactor for the catalytic test. The flow rates of DME, O 2 and He were 10, 5, 80 mL min \u22121 [STP], respectively, and were controlled by three different AFC 80MD digital mass flow controllers (Qualiflow). The gases were well-mixed before entering the reactor. The reactions were performed at 450\u2013850 \u00b0C. The water in the effluent gas was removed by passing through an anhydrous CaCl 2 adsorbent, and then the products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (CP-3800, VARIAN) that was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a Hayesep Q, a Poraplot Q and a 5 \u00c5 sieve molecular capillary columns for separating and detecting H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 , respectively, and a flame ionization detector (FID) for analyzing DME and CH 4 . Cell performance was tested in a home-built electrochemical work station. Fig. 1 illustrates the detailed configuration of the single cell test setup. The cell was sealed onto a quartz tube reactor using silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai, China) with the cathode side exposed to ambient air while the anode chamber was swept with a DME-O 2 gas mixture or 3% water humidified hydrogen at a flow rate of 80 mL min \u22121 [STP]. The test temperature ranged from 600 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C. The I \u2013 V polarization curves of the cells were collected by a digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2420, USA) that was based on a four-probe configuration. Electrode performance was determined by a complete cell configuration, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cells was measured under open circuit voltage (OCV) or a constant voltage polarization of 0.7 V conditions using a Solartron 1260 Frequency Response Analyzer combined with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency ranged from 0.1 to 1000 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 20 mV. To test the coke resistance of the Ni-YSZ anode, approximately 0.2 g of Ni-YSZ powder that was sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h was placed into a flow-through quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c8 mm and treated in the DME-O 2 gas mixture (DME:O 2 = 2:1, volume ratio) with a constant DME flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP] at selected temperatures (800, 750, 700, 650 or 600 \u00b0C) for 30 min. Then, the reactor was quickly cooled down to room temperature by removing the reactor from the furnace instantly and placing it in an atmosphere of pure helium. Next, approximately 0.02 g of the treated sample was placed into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm, and 10 vol.% O 2 \u2013Ar gas mixture at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was introduced to the reactor for the oxygen temperature programmed oxidation (O 2 -TPO) analysis. After flowing with gas at room temperature for 30 min to remove any weakly adsorbed surface species, the reactor was heated to 900 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . During the programmatic increase in temperature, the carbon deposited on the Ni-YSZ was progressively oxidized to CO 2 , which was analyzed on-line using a Hiden QIC-20 mass spectrometer (MS). The microscopic features of the fuel cells from a cross-sectional view were examined using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Quanta-200). The elemental distribution in the electrodes were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Non-catalytic and catalytic reaction between DME and O 2 It is believed that the electro-oxidation of DME over an SOFC anode proceeds via an indirect pathway by first converting to CH 4 , CO and H 2 . To achieve a high cell power output, the reactions towards CO and H 2 are preferred, whereas reactions towards methane and other hydrocarbons or oxygenated-hydrocarbons should be suppressed because the oxidation rate of hydrocarbons and oxygenated-hydrocarbons over a fuel cell anode is much less than H 2 and the H 2 \u2013CO gas mixture. Thermodynamically, coke formation is determined by the oxygen-to-carbon molar ratio in the reactants and the operation temperature; however, the actual amount of carbon that is deposited over the catalyst is also closely related to the reaction pathway. By using a DME-O 2 mixture as the fuel gas, both the non-catalytic gas phase reaction and the catalytic partial oxidation over the fuel cell anode can occur within the anode chamber at the operating temperature. For both types of reactions, we found that CH 4 , CO, CO 2 , H 2 and H 2 O are the main gaseous products. The possible chemical reaction formulas for the partial oxidation of DME are as follows. CH 3 OCH 3 \u2192 H 2 + CO + CH 4 + CO 2 CH 4 + O 2 \u2192 H 2 + CO + CO 2 + H 2 O CH 4 + H 2 O \u2192 H 2 + CO + CO 2 CH 4 + CO 2 \u2192 H 2 + CO + H 2 O CO 2 + H 2 \u2194 CO + H 2 O The overall reaction is: CH 3 OCH 3 + O 2 \u2192 CO + H 2 + CH 4 + CO 2 + H 2 O The \u0394H of the partial oxidation of DME reaction is \u221274.065 kJ mol \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C, and the value is \u221234.970 kJ mol \u22121 at the operation temperature of 800 \u00b0C, and not high. Some endothermic reactions, such as CH 4 steam and CO 2 reforming, accompany with the partial oxidation of DME reaction, which help keeping the heat in balance. It indicated that DME-O 2 mixture could be used as the fuel for SOFC. Fig. 2 a and b shows the temperature dependence of DME conversion and CH 4 , CO and CO 2 selectivity without and with the presence of the Ni-YSZ cermet anode catalyst, respectively, within the investigated temperature range of 450\u2013850 \u00b0C. High DME conversion was observed even without the presence of the Ni-YSZ catalyst, and it reached 60% at 600 \u00b0C and increased to 96% at 800 \u00b0C. Previously, we demonstrated that pure DME has a relatively high thermal stability with a DME conversion of less than 2% at 600 \u00b0C and 20% at 800 \u00b0C by thermal decomposition. It is clear that the presence of oxygen promoted the decomposition of DME. Recently, Murray et al. demonstrated by kinetic modeling and a mass spectroscopy examination that oxygen can promote the decomposition of DME into primarily H 2 , CO and CH 4 [32] . The promoting effect is due to the reduced activation energy ( E a ) that is required for DME decomposition in the presence of oxygen. For example, the E a for the extraction of an H atom from DME (CH 3 OCH 3 + O 2 CH 3 OCH 2 + HO 2 ) is 188 kJ mol \u22121 , but it is as high as 426 kJ mol \u22121 for the unimolecular decomposition of DME (CH 3 OCH 3 CH 3 + CH 3 O). As shown in Fig. 2 a, a large amount of methane was formed by the gas phase reaction, and methane selectivity increased with a decrease of the reaction temperature from 850 to 700 \u00b0C. It reached its maximum at 700 \u00b0C, and then it decreased with the decrease of the reaction temperatures from 700 to 450 \u00b0C. The above results indicate that the actual gases approaching the anode are mainly composed of CH 4 , CO 2 , CO and H 2 , and H 2 O when applying DME and oxygen as the feed gas. Fig. 2 b shows that the DME conversions were 97 and 76% at 800 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C, respectively, when Ni-YSZ catalyst was applied. DME conversion was 57% even at 450 \u00b0C, which was much higher than the conversion without the catalyst (26%). The above results indicate that the Ni-YSZ catalyst dramatically improved DME conversion at lower temperatures. Because the electrochemical oxidation rate of methane is much slower than hydrogen, the reaction towards methane is not favored for the following power generation. It is interesting to note that methane selectivity also had a maximum at 700 \u00b0C for the DME partial oxidation reaction under the catalysis of the Ni-YSZ cermet. However, methane selectivity in the presence of the Ni-YSZ catalyst was relatively lower than that without the catalyst. For example, it was 8% and 30% at 850 \u00b0C with and without the Ni-YSZ catalyst, respectively. This further suggested that the nickel cermet anode enhanced the methane partial oxidation and reforming reaction. 3.2 Cell performance An anode-supported single cell with a configuration of (anode) Ni-YSZ | YSZ | SDC | BSCF-SDC (cathode) was used for the cell performance test. Fig. 3 shows the I\u2013V and I\u2013P polarization curves of the fuel cells operating on hydrogen and DME-O 2 (DME:O 2 = 2:1, volume ratio) fuel gases at temperatures between 600 and 800 \u00b0C. The corresponding EIS under OCV or a constant polarization voltage of 0.7 V conditions are shown in Fig. 4 . The linear response of the cell voltage to the applied current density, even at high current density, indicates that concentration polarization did not occur for this cell, which operated on both hydrogen and DME-O 2 fuel gases. This could be explained by the high porosity of the electrodes that allowed for the free diffusion of the reaction gas and products within the electrode (this will be discussed later). As shown in Fig. 3 a, favorable peak power densities of \u223c600 and 1800 mW cm \u22122 were achieved at 600 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively. It is well known that the BSCF possesses excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction at intermediate temperatures. However, the interfacial reaction between the BSCF and the YSZ electrolyte is a serious problem. By using an SDC barrier layer, the interfacial reaction between BSCF and YSZ was effectively suppressed; as a result, a very high power output was achieved for hydrogen fuel. By using the DME-O 2 mixture as the fuel gas, cell peak power density still reached \u223c400 and \u223c1400 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 b. The power output was a bit lower than that operating on H 2 at a corresponding temperature. This is because H 2 and CO were the main products for the catalytic partial oxidation of DME, and the concentration of H 2 in the fuel gas when DME-O 2 mixture as fuel is lower than that of pure H 2 fuel under the same flow rate. Fig. 4 a and b shows that the electrode polarization resistances are comparable by using H 2 and DME-O 2 as fuels under a constant polarization voltage of 0.7 V at corresponding operating temperatures. Interestingly, under open circuit conditions, the electrode polarization resistance of the cell operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture was much larger than that of the one on H 2 as shown in Fig. 4 c and d. This is because DME was not fully converted to H 2 and CO under OCV conditions; therefore, the concentration of DME increased in the anode chamber, which led to an increase in electrode resistance. When the cell was polarized at a constant voltage of 0.7 V, a large amount of O 2\u2212 was transferred from the cathode through the electrolyte to the anode, and DME was almost completely converted to H 2 and CO on the anode surface; consequently, the electrode resistance of the cell was significantly reduced. Performance stability is an important concern for SOFCs operating on hydrocarbon fuels. In our previous work, we found an obvious degradation of cell performance after operating on pure DME under a constant polarization current density of 1000 mA cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C for 300 min for an anode-supported SOFC with a conventional nickel cermet anode [33] . The performance stability at 700 \u00b0C for the cell operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture was also tested in this study. During the stability test, the volume ratio of DME to oxygen was 2:1, and the DME feed rate was set to 40 mL min \u22121 [STP]. Because many factors can lead to cell performance degradation, for a reasonable comparison, the operational stability of a similar cell on hydrogen fuel was also investigated. The cell was polarized under a constant current density of 1000 mA cm \u22122 when operating on H 2 , but it was fixed at 625 mA cm \u22122 when operating on DME-O 2 fuel to ensure a similar polarization voltage of \u223c0.7 V. As shown in Fig. 5 , the cell voltage was relatively stable and decreased only slightly from an initial value of 0.71 to 0.70 V after the operation on hydrogen for a period of 340 min. When operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture, cell voltage also decreased only slightly from an initial value of 0.73 V to 0.71 V after operation for a period of 340 min. This indicates that cell performance was nearly stable when operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture. After the performance stability test of the cell operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture at 700 \u00b0C was complete, the cell was slowly cooled down to room temperature under OCV conditions with the protection of anode by hydrogen atmosphere. Fig. 6 shows a digital picture of the anode surface after operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture. A dark coating was observed on the Ni-YSZ anode surface. This implies that coke likely formed after the stability test. It is well known that carbon deposited on the anode active sites decreases cell performance, and too much carbon deposition on the anode can cause the fuel cell to fail by destroying the geometric integrity of the cell. However, as shown in Fig. 6 , no cracks formed on the fuel cell. This suggests that the cell maintained sound geometric integrity after the stability test. To further exploit carbon formation behavior on the anode, after the stability test, the single cell was investigated by SEM-EDX. Fig. 7 shows the SEM morphology of the four-layer cell in a cross-sectional view. Porous electrodes and dense electrolyte morphology were clearly demonstrated, which ensure high cell performance. No delimitation of the cell components was observed, which further indicates that carbon deposition did not destroy or impair the geometric integrity of the fuel cell. Carbon deposition on the anode was further analyzed using EDX. As shown in Fig. 8 , Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 represented the selected locations within the YSZ electrolyte, within the electrolyte\u2013anode interface, within the anode and within the anode near the surface, respectively. In principle, there should be no carbon deposited over the dense electrolyte from DME decomposition because it could not reach the electrolyte. However, a weak carbon peak was detected by EDX on the electrolyte layer as shown in Fig. 8 a. This carbon may have come from contamination when the sample was being prepared for EDX analysis. The weight ratio of contaminated carbon in Region 1 was approximately 22.8 wt.%. As shown in Fig. 8 b and c, the amounts of carbon in Regions 2 and 3 were 20.7 and 28.6 wt.%, respectively, which was similar to the amount of contaminated carbon found in Region 1. This implies that there was almost no carbon deposited due to DME decomposition inside the anode after operation on the DME-O 2 fuel gas. In Region 4, i.e., the location near the anode's outer surface, the intensity of the carbon peak increased significantly as compared to that in Regions 1\u20133, and the amount of carbon reached 52.6 wt.%; this is shown in Fig. 8 d. Based on the above-mentioned results, carbon deposition occurred only at the outer surface of the anode when operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture. It is well-known that the active sites in an electrode located on the narrow regions close to the electrolyte have a thickness of only tens of micrometers [41] . The SEM-EDX analysis showed that no coke formation occurred in those active regions, which explains the relatively stable performance of a cell operating on the DME-O 2 gas mixture. 3.3 Carbon deposition behavior In a previous study, we demonstrated that carbon deposition on the traditional Ni-YSZ anode of an SOFC was serious when pure DME was used as fuel [33] , because the Ni-YSZ cermet can catalyze the decomposition of DME with the formation of coke over the anode. A large amount of carbon deposition can damage the anode structure, which affects cell performance. Based on the above-mentioned SEM-EDX analysis, the carbon was only deposited over the anode's outer surface after operation for a relatively short period of 340 min. However, for practical applications, the fuel cell must be operated for much longer time period. To further examine the coke formation behavior of the anode operating on DME-O 2 fuel gas, the Ni-YSZ anode material was treated in the DME-O 2 gas mixture at different temperatures for 30 min under OCV conditions, and O 2 -TPO analysis was performed. Fig. 9 presents the O 2 -TPO profiles with CO 2 signals. The amount of deposited carbon on the Ni-YSZ powder that was treated under a DME-O 2 atmosphere was much less than the one treated in a pure DME atmosphere for the same time period of 30 min [33] . In particular, carbon deposition was suppressed effectively at temperatures below 650 \u00b0C. The CO 2 peak areas for the Ni-YSZ anode after treatment in the DME-O 2 gas mixture at 800, 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C were 0.43 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.04 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 2.77 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 1.50 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 0.71 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , respectively, whereas they were 4.77 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 3.51 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 2.99 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 2.51 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for the Ni-YSZ anode after the treatment in pure DME for the same time period at 800, 750, 700 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively [33] . It is interesting that the amount of deposited carbon increased with temperature, reaching a maximum at 700 \u00b0C, and then decreased with the further increase in operating temperature. This trend is the same as the one for methane selectivity, which implies that coke formation is mainly due to methane decomposition. To further observe and assess coke formation in an actual fuel cell operating on a DME-O 2 gas mixture under OCV conditions, five identical single cells with a Ni-YSZ anode (the diameter of the cells were all about 12.51 mm) were treated with the DME-O 2 gas mixture (DME:O 2 = 2:1, volume ratio) at various temperatures (800, 750, 700, 650 and 600 \u00b0C) for a period of 30 min. During treatment, the DME flow rate was maintained at 40 ml min \u22121 [STP]. Fig. 10 shows the digital photos of a fresh cell and the cells after treatment in the DME-O 2 atmosphere at various temperatures, which are displayed from the anode side. In our previous work, severe damage to the Ni-YSZ anode disks was observed when the cells were treated in pure DME, especially at temperatures lower than 750 \u00b0C [33] . However, as shown in Fig. 10 , no obvious deformation was found in all of the cells after treatment in DME-O 2 , and a small amount of black carbon was detected on the anode surface for the cells treated between 600 and 700 \u00b0C. The weight gain and diameter changes of the cells after treatment in DME-O 2 at various temperatures are listed in Table 1 . The weight of the cells after treatment at 800 and 750 \u00b0C increased by only 0.43 and 2.6%, respectively, whereas only a minimal change was observed in the size of the cells. Clearly, both the weight and the size changes originated due to coke formation on the anode. In connection with our previous results for cells treated on pure DME [33] , carbon deposition was effectively suppressed by introducing O 2 into the DME fuel gas. The cell that was treated at 700 \u00b0C showed the largest size expansion (10%) among the treated cells, which agreed well with the fact that coke formation was the most severe at 700 \u00b0C when operating on DME-O 2 fuel gas. Under current polarization, additional oxygen was diffused from the cathode side to the anode side; as a result, the oxygen-to-carbon ratio increased, which effectively suppressed coke formation over the anode thermodynamically. As a result, under actual fuel cell operation conditions (under polarization), less severe coke formation over the fuel cell anode was detected as shown in the previous section. 4 Conclusions Oxygen promoted DME decomposition both with and without the Ni-YSZ cermet anode at intermediate temperatures. In particular, the Ni-YSZ anode catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity for DME partial oxidation with DME conversion reaching 57% even at 450 \u00b0C. The main products of the reaction between DME and O 2 are CO, H 2 , CH 4 , H 2 O and CO 2 . Methane is not favored due to the low oxidation rate over the anode. Methane selectivity reached a maximum at 700 \u00b0C both with and without a Ni-YSZ catalyst. The good catalytic activity of Ni-YSZ for DME partial oxidation resulted in high cell performance when the SOFC was operated on DME-O 2 at intermediate temperatures with peak power densities that were comparable to operation on hydrogen fuel even at 700 \u00b0C. The performance of the cell operating on the DME-O 2 fuel gas under current polarization for a test period of 340 min at 700 \u00b0C was reasonably stable. Although carbon deposition did occur on the anode's outer surface after the stability test, coke formation was greatly suppressed in the presence of oxygen. No carbon was formed inside the anode layer, which ensured stable cell performance. Maximum carbon deposition was found are approximately 700 \u00b0C for the anode operating on DME-O 2 fuel (2:1 volume ratio); therefore, the elimination of deposited carbon at 700 \u00b0C is the next major challenge. The results of present study suggest that the operation temperature of a SOFC operating on DME fuel can be effectively reduced to lower than 800 \u00b0C through internal partial oxidation.

        "abstract": "Inexpensive 20 wt.% Ni-Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 catalysts are synthesized by a glycine nitrate process (GNP) and an impregnation process (IMP). The catalytic activity for ethanol steam reforming (ESR) at 400-650 \u00b0C, catalytic stability and carbon deposition properties are investigated. Ni-Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 (GNP) shows a higher catalytic performance than Ni-Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 (IMP), especially at lower temperatures. It also presents a better coking resistance and a lower graphitization degree of the deposited carbon. The superior catalytic activity and coke resistance of Ni-Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 (GNP) is attributed to the small particle size of the active metallic nickel phase and the strong interaction between the nickel and the Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 support, as evidenced by the XRD and H 2-TPR. The Ni-Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 (GNP) is further applied as an anode functional layer in solid oxide fuel cells operating on ethanol steam. The cell yields a peak power density of 536 mW cm -2 at 700 \u00b0C when operating on EtOH-H 2O gas mixtures, which is only slightly lower than that of hydrogen fuel, whereas the cell without the functional layer failed for short-term operations. Ni-Ce 0.8Zr 0.2O 2 (GNP) is promising as an active and highly coking-resistant catalyst layer for solid-oxide fuel cells operating on ethanol steam fuel. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The properties and performance of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) + Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) (70:30 in weight ratio) composite cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells were investigated. Mechanical mixing of BSCF with SDC resulted in the adhesion of fine SDC particles to the surface of coarse BSCF grains. XRD, SEM-EDX and O 2 -TPD results demonstrated that the phase reaction between BSCF and SDC was negligible, constricted only at the BSCF and SDC interface, and throughout the entire cathode with the formation of new (Ba,Sr,Sm,Ce)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite phase at a firing temperature of 900, 1000, and \u2265 1050 \u00b0C, respectively. The BSCF + SDC electrode sintered at 1000 \u00b0C showed an area specific resistance of \u223c0.064 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C, which is a slight improvement over the BSCF (0.099 \u03a9 cm 2 ) owing to the enlarged cathode surface area contributed from the fine SDC particles. A peak power density of 1050 and \u223c382 mW cm \u22122 was reached at 600 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively, for a thin-film electrolyte cell with the BSCF + SDC cathode fired from 1000 \u00b0C. Keywords Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 Samaria doped ceria Solid-oxide fuel cells Cathode 1 Introduction Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are all-solid electrochemical devices that convert the chemical energy stored in fuels to electricity in a highly efficient and low-emission way. Recently, SOFCs have received considerable attention due to the increased importance of sustainability associated with future worldwide development [1\u20133] . The solid-state reaction between the electrolyte and electrode is a practical problem, since such a reaction could occur during the fabrication and application of SOFCs [4\u20138] . The reaction may result in the formation of non-conducting phases between the electrode and electrolyte interface, which would greatly increase the interfacial polarization resistance of the cathode. On the other hand, the electrocatalyst-electrolyte composite cathode is frequently applied in an attempt to improve the performance of oxide electrodes [9\u201313] . However, the phase reaction between the components in the composite electrode and its influence on the cathode performance has been rarely exploited [14,15] . Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 (BSCF) is a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature (IT) SOFCs [16\u201319] . The BSCF + SDC (samaria doped ceria) composite has also been investigated as a potential cathode for IT-SOFCs [20\u201322] . Detailed and systematical investigations into the reaction mechanism between BSCF and SDC are helpful in order to optimize the BSCF + SDC cathode. These investigations are also important in that they serve as guidance for the development of new composite cathode materials. In this study, the performance of the BSCF + SDC composite cathode was intensely examined. Particular attention was paid to the phase reaction between BSCF and SDC and its effect on the performance of the composite cathode at intermediate temperatures. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis BSCF and SDC powders were prepared by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing method [23] . Metal nitrates in analytic grade were made into aqueous solutions. Their precise concentrations were determined by the EDTA titration method. These metal nitrates were then used as the metal ion sources. The required amounts of metal nitrates were set according to the stoichiometry of the aimed product. They were made into a mixed aqueous solution, followed by the addition of EDTA and citric acid, where both served as complexing agents to ensure the molecule-level homogeneous mixing of the metal ions in the solution. NH 4 OH was applied during the evaporation process to ensure a solution pH value of \u223c6. Through heating and stirring, a clear gel was finally obtained. The gel was then heated at 250 \u00b0C for 10 h to form a solid precursor and finally calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h to result in oxides with the desired final composition and lattice structure. 2.2 Material characterization The phase structure of the oxide samples from various conditions was observed through the use of an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes were characterized using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM, QUATA-2000) equipped with an Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) attachment. The specific surface areas of the samples were characterized by N 2 adsorption using a BELSORP II instrument at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Electrical conductivity was measured within the temperature range of 300\u2013900 \u00b0C at intervals of 10 \u00b0C by using the four-terminal DC technique over bar-shape samples with dimensions of 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 12 mm 3 , and Ag paste was used for electrodes. Current and voltage were applied/detected by the Keithely 2420 source meter. Sufficient stabilization time was applied at each measurement point in order to ensure that the electrical conductivity reached steady state. Under the reduced atmosphere (inert gas) and with the programmed increase of the temperature, the metal ions in oxides with variable valence states could be thermally reduced. The reduction process results in the release of lattice oxygen, which can be detected by a mass spectrometer or gas chromatography. Such a process is denoted as O 2 -TPD thereafter. For a typical O 2 -TPD experiment in this study, about 150 mg sample was loaded into a U-type quartz glass tube with an inner diameter of 1 mm. The reactor was then placed in a single-zone furnace equipped with a temperature controller. Argon was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 . The temperature was increased from 200 to 1000 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The effluent gases were monitored by a mass spectrometer (Hiden, QIC-20). 2.3 Symmetric cell and fuel cell fabrication Symmetric cells with the configuration of electrode|SDC|electrode were applied for the impedance studies. Dense SDC pellets of 12 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm in thickness were prepared by dry pressing and then were sintered in air at 1350 \u00b0C for 5 h. To prepare the composite electrode, the BSCF and SDC powders with the weight ratio of 70:30 were first dispersed in a pre-mixed solution of glycerol, ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol to form a colloidal suspension by utilizing a high-energy ball milling process. The resultant colloidal suspension was then spray deposited symmetrically on both surfaces of the SDC pellet using a spray gun with N 2 as the carrier gas, and then calcined at 900\u20131100 \u00b0C for 5 h in ambient air to form the porous symmetric electrode layers. Anode-supported complete cells with the SDC electrolyte were prepared using a co-pressing technique. Anode powders consisting of 60 wt.% NiO and 40 wt.% SDC were prepared by mixing NiO and SDC physically in an agate mortar by hand. To fabricate the single cell, the well-mixed NiO + SDC powders were first pressed as substrates; SDC powders were then added onto the substrates and pressed again to form bi-layer pellets (area: \u223c1.25 cm 2 ), which were fired in air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h in order to achieve the densification of the electrolyte layer. The BSCF + SDC colloidal suspension was then spray deposited onto the electrolyte surfaces of the sintered bi-layer pellets, and then fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h to form the compete cells with a porous cathode layer (area: \u223c0.48 cm 2 ). 2.4 Electrochemical performance test The electrode performance was investigated with a symmetrical or complete cell configuration by the AC impedance method using an electrochemical workstation composed of a Solartron 1287 potentiostat in combination with a 1260A frequency response analyzer. The applied frequency ranged from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. The overall impedance data were fitted by a complex non-linear least squares (CNLS) fitting program in ZView 2.9b software. I\u2013V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-terminal configuration. The fuel cell was sealed onto a quartz tube reactor with the cathode side exposed to ambient air. Pure hydrogen at a flow rate of 80 ml min \u22121 [STP] was fed into the anode chamber as fuel. Silver paste was painted over the electrode surface as the current collector by a brush and the cell with the current collector was fired at 800 \u00b0C for half an hour before the test. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of firing temperature on the phase reaction between SDC and BSCF It is well known that cobalt-based perovskite materials have high reactivity. The reaction between cobalt-contained BSCF and SDC at various firing temperatures were investigated by ex-situ techniques. BSCF and SDC were mechanically mixed at the weight ratio of 70:30 with the help of a high-energy ball miller (Fritsch Pulverisette 6) employing zirconium oxide as the grinding ball and isopropyl alcohol as the solvent, and then calcined at various temperatures in air for 5 h. 900 \u00b0C calcined BSCF and SDC from an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process were applied as the starting materials for this study. After the calcination, the samples were cooled to room temperature and examined by various techniques to detect the possible phase reaction. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the BSCF + SDC composite oxides that were calcined at various temperatures for 5 h. For comparison, the patterns of the 900 \u00b0C calcined BSCF and SDC samples were also presented. As can be seen, the raw materials of the BSCF and SDC show the pure cubic perovskite phase and cubic fluorite phase, respectively. The BSCF + SDC after being calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h showed similar diffraction patterns to the non-calcined mixture. This suggests that the phase reaction between the BSCF and SDC at 900 \u00b0C was negligible. When the calcination temperature was elevated to 1000 \u00b0C, additional diffraction peaks appeared, located near the right side of the main BSCF peak, suggesting the formation of a new perovskite oxide (perovskite-B) with a smaller lattice parameter to BSCF. Furthermore, a new diffraction peak appeared at 2 \u03b8 of 28.8\u00b0, which was ascribed to the Ba(Sr)CeO 3 phase ( Fig. 1 (b)). With the further increase of calcination/firing temperature, the intensity of the BSCF and SDC diffraction peaks decreased while the intensity of perovskite-B increased. When the calcination temperature was increased to 1100 \u00b0C, the BSCF phase completely disappeared while the intensity of perovskite-B phase was obviously strengthened. The final reaction products of BSCF and SDC were examined by sol\u2013gel synthesis based on the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process. Metal nitrates of Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 , Fe(NO 3 ) 3 , Sm(NO 3 ) 3 and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 according to the stoichiometry of BSCF + SDC (70:30 in weight ratio) composite were mixed in the solution stage of the EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process. The metal diffusion block was eliminated during the phase formation. Therefore, the obtained products reflect the most stable products of the solid-state reaction between BSCF and SDC. Such a sample was named as sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC composite in the following section of this paper. As shown in Fig. 1 , it had the same diffraction patterns as the 1100 \u00b0C calcined mechanically mixed BSCF + SDC composite. This suggests that the solid-state reaction between BSCF and SDC was completed at 1100 \u00b0C. It is well known that samaria and ceria both can dope into the A-site of the perovskite, and the successful doping of ceria into the B-site of perovskite has also been reported [24\u201329] . Ce 3+ and Sm 3+ have smaller ionic radii than Ba 2+ and Sr 2+ , and their doping into the A-site of BSCF would result in the shrinking of the lattice. While Ce 4+ has a much larger ionic radius (0.87 \u00c5) than cobalt (HS (high spin)-Co 2+ : 0.745 \u00c5; HS\u2013Co 3+ : 0.61 \u00c5, HS\u2013Co 4+ : 0.53 \u00c5) and iron (HS\u2013Fe 3+ :0.645 \u00c5, Fe 4+ : 0.585 \u00c5) at the B-site, the doping of ceria into the B-site would result in the expansion of the lattice. Since a smaller lattice parameter for the perovskite-B than the BSCF was observed, samaria and ceria were likely incorporated into the A-site of the BSCF during the firing process. This assumption is supported by the successful synthesis of the perovskite oxides with the desired compositions of (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 0.8 Sm 0.2 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 , (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 0.8 Ce 0.2 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 and (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 0.8 (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 ) 0.2 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 based on an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process as shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 3 shows the surface morphologies of BSCF, SDC and BSCF + SDC (70:30 in weight ratio) mixed powders fired at various temperatures for 5 h. The BSCF oxide had a grain size of 1\u20135 \u03bcm, while the SDC had a finer particle size of \u223c100 nm. BET measurements show that the BSCF had a surface area of only 0.25\u20130.4 m 2 g \u22121 and the SDC of \u223c6 m 2 g \u22121 (1000 \u00b0C calcined). Fig. 3 C shows the typical morphologies of the very fine particles surrounding the surface of the BSCF with a larger grain size in the non-calcined mechanically mixed BSCF + SDC powders. Similar phenomena were also observed in the investigation of the BSCF + LaCoO 3 composite cathode [30] . When the mixed powders were calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 5 h ( Fig. 3 D), the SDC grains grew obviously as compared with the fresh samples. Based on the EDX results, at least two micro domains i.e., the BSCF-enriched phase and the SDC-enriched phase, were observed. The adhesion of SDC to BSCF was much improved after the calcination. However, the (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 was hardly detected by SEM-EDX for this sample. From the combined SEM-EDX and XRD results, it is proposed that the formation of the new phase was located only at the BSCF\u2013SDC interface. With the further increase of the calcination temperature to 1100 \u00b0C, the BSCF phase completely disappeared. The only observable phase by EDX was (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite, which was well sintered as shown in Fig. 3 E. The phase reaction between the BSCF and SDC was further investigated by the O 2 -TPD technique. For the perovskite under programmed heating in a reduced oxygen partial pressure atmosphere (argon), the B-site metal ions with variable valence states is thermally reduced to lower valence states accompanied with the release of oxygen from the lattice structure. The released oxygen can be in-situ detected by a mass spectrometer. Normally, two types of desorption peaks may be observed for cobalt and iron based perovskites. For such perovskites, one or more peaks between 300 and 600 \u00b0C are associated with the reduction of Co 4+ /Fe 4+ to Co 3+ /Fe 3+ . Sometimes one or more additional peaks may be observed at T > 700 \u00b0C, and this is related to the thermal reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . The shape and position of the peaks are closely related with the elemental composition in the A and B-sites of perovskite. The different metal ions in the A-site of perovskite affect the reduction/oxidation properties of the B-site metal ions. The shift of the oxygen desorption peak reflects the compositional change of the perovskite. Fig. 4 shows the O 2 -TPD profiles of BSCF, sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC composite, and mechanically mixed BSCF + SDC mixture calcined at various temperatures for 5 h (25, 900, 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C). The BSCF sample showed only one desorption peak (peak-A) at around 410 \u00b0C at the low temperature zone (300\u2013600 \u00b0C). For the sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC composite, one desorption peak (peak-B) was also present, but shifted slightly to a lower temperature of \u223c360 \u00b0C. Based on the XRD and SEM-EDX results, the sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC composite was mainly composed of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite. Therefore, peak-B was assigned to the release of oxygen from the lattice of the (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 phase. This suggests that the incorporation of Sm 3+ and Ce 3+ into the A-site of the BSCF resulted in the increased reducibility of cobalt and iron ions in the perovskite. For the sample calcined at 900 \u00b0C, only one desorption peak around 410 \u00b0C was observed, which was located at the same position as that of the non-calcined mechanically mixed BSCF + SDC oxides and the pure BSCF. This suggests that the reaction between the BSCF and SDC was negligible at 900 \u00b0C, which agrees well with the XRD results. At a calcination temperature of 950 \u00b0C, the desorption peak shifted slightly to a lower temperature of 390 \u00b0C. With the further increase of the calcination temperature to 1000 \u00b0C, two strongly overlapped desorption peaks were observed with the new appearance of one (peak-B) located near the peak-A. This suggests that a partial reaction between the BSCF and SDC with the formation of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 phase occurred, and this coincides well with the XRD results. The intensity of peak-B increased steadily with temperature while it decreased for peak-A. Only peak-B survived after calcination at 1050 \u00b0C or higher, suggesting the complete reaction of BSCF and SDC. The aforementioned conclusions were also in agreement with those derived based on X-ray and SEM-EDX results. 3.2 Influence of phase reaction on the electrochemical performance of BSCF + SDC As demonstrated previously, the phase reaction between BSCF and SDC is closely related with the firing temperatures. The effect of phase reaction on the cathode performance was then indirectly examined by varying the firing temperatures for the cathode layer. The area specific resistances (ASRs) of the BSCF + SDC electrode fired at various temperatures are presented in Fig. 5 . The ASR experienced a decrease with temperature that reached a minimum value at 1000 \u00b0C, and then increased sharply with the further increase of firing temperature. For example, the ASR of the cathodes at 600 \u00b0C fired from 900, 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 \u00b0C, was 0.184, 0.106, 0.064, 0.176 and 0.270 \u03a9 cm 2 , respectively. A similar trend was also observed for the SSC + SDC cathode in literature [31] . The BSCF + SDC demonstrated modestly better performance than the BSCF cathode when the firing temperature was 1000 \u00b0C. However, it showed a worse performance than the BSCF at other temperatures. Even when fired at 1000 \u00b0C, the increase in cathode performance with the SDC addition was very limited for the BSCF + SDC cathode. For example, an ASR of about 0.099 \u03a9 cm 2 was observed for a pure BSCF cathode, while it was about 0.064 \u03a9 cm 2 for a BSCF + SDC composite cathode with an improvement of only \u223c36%. For SSC, LSM and LSCF, the formation of a composite cathode by the introduction of ionic conducting phase resulted in the improvement of the cathode performance by more than one order of magnitude [31\u201333] . Such improvement was due to the extension of the active oxygen reduction sites from the traditional electrode\u2013electrolyte\u2013gas phase (three-phase-boundary, TPB) to the entire cathode layer. Since the BSCF by itself is a mixed conducting oxide with the oxygen ionic conductivity even higher than SDC [16] , the slightly better performance for the BSCF + SDC cathode as compared with the pure BSCF was unlikely contributed from the oxygen ionic conductivity of SDC. Based on the SEM results in Fig. 3 , it may be related with the enlarged surface area contributed from the SDC phase. However, the strong dependence of ASR on firing temperature suggests that the ASR could also be closely related with the phase reaction between BSCF and SDC. As shown in Figs. 2\u20134 , phase reaction between BSCF and SDC with the formation of new perovskite (Ba,Sr,Sm,Ce)(Co,Fe)O 3-\u03b4 could occur, depending on the firing temperatures. The electrical and electrochemical properties of the reaction products between BSCF and SDC were then investigated. Fig. 6 shows the electrical conductivity of the BSCF, sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC composite, A-site Sm 3+ incorporated BSCF (Sm 0.2 Ba 0.4 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3-\u03b4 ), A-site Ce 4+ incorporated BSCF (Ce 0.2 Ba 0.4 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 ), and A-site ceria and samaria incorporated BSCF ((Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 ) 0.2 Ba 0.4 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3-\u03b4 ), measured by four-terminal DC techniques. It shows that the doping of Sm 3+ and Ce 3+ into the A-site of BSCF perovskite resulted in the increased electrical conductivity of the oxide. Such improvement can be explained in part by the fact that the doping of Ce 3+ and Sm 3+ into A-site of the BSCF resulted in the shrinking of the lattice. Because Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ have smaller ionic size than Ba 2+ /Sr 2+ , their doping in the A-site of the BSCF promotes the B-site metal ions to take a higher valence state. Consequently, the distance between the B-site metals became closer and thus it is easier for electron exchange between the B-site ions to occur. On the other hand, Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ have a higher valence state than Ba 2+ /Sr 2+ , and thus the doping of Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ into the A-site of the BSCF reduced the oxygen vacancy concentration, which also is also beneficial for increasing the p-type conductivity. The electrode performances of sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC composite and (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 ) 0.2 Ba 0.4 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 , were measured based on symmetric cell configuration and a comparison with the pure BSCF cathode. The same firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C was selected in this investigation to ensure similar cathode morphologies for all the samples. As shown in Fig. 7 , both sol\u2013gel derived BSCF + SDC and (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 ) 0.2 Ba 0.4 Sr 0.4 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 demonstrated relatively worse cathode performance when compared with the BSCF. Such a decrease in electrode performance can be related to the reduced oxygen vacancy concentration due to the incorporation of Ce 3+ /Sm 3+ in the A-site of BSCF. Based on above results, a reaction mechanism between the BSCF and SDC for the high-temperature firing and the influence of the reaction on the cathode performance of the composite oxide, as shown in Fig. 8 , was proposed. The mechanical mixing of the BSCF and SDC resulted in the fine SDC particles being loosely attached to the surfaces of the big BSCF grains. At a temperature of 900 \u00b0C, the reaction between the BSCF and SDC was negligible. However, the connection between the BSCF and SDC particles was also poor after firing at this temperature, which resulted in a relatively high interfacial polarization. Therefore, large ASRs were observed for the cathode fired at this temperature. The steady increase of firing temperature resulted in enhanced particle connections, which account for the improved ASRs with increasing temperature up to 1000 \u00b0C. When the firing/calcination temperature reached 1000 \u00b0C, the inter-diffusion between BSCF and SDC was enhanced and the constricted solid-state reaction between BSCF and SDC occurred with the formation of a third phase of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 at their phase boundary. The limited reactive sintering aided in the adhesion of fine SDC particles to the BSCF surfaces firmly. In connection with the higher electronic conductivity of the third phase than with the reactants of BSCF and SDC, an improved current distribution efficiency could then be expected, which is beneficial for reducing the interfacial polarization resistance. Although the new phase has worse activity for oxygen reduction than the BSCF, its detrimental effect on the cathode performance is negligible since it located only along the BSCF and SDC interface and its thickness is small due to the limited reaction. Instead, the relatively higher surface area of the SDC phase successfully enlarged the active sites for oxygen reduction. In connection with the good electrochemical activity of SDC for oxygen adsorption and activation, the improved cathode performance of the BSCF + SDC composite cathode fired at 1000 \u00b0C as compared with the pure BSCF cathode, is then well understood. With the further increase of the firing temperature to 1050 \u00b0C or higher, however, the diffusion block between the BSCF and SDC phases was successfully overcome, which resulted in the formation of the (Ba,Sr,Sm,Ce)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 new phase throughout the entire cathode, a material with worse cathode performance than BSCF. Furthermore, the cathode sintering was also accelerated. Both detrimental effects resulted in a sharp decrease in cathode performance with the further increase of the firing temperature. Finally, an optimal firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C for fabricating the BSCF + SDC cathode layer was developed. Whole cells with the BSCF + SDC cathode fired from 1000 \u00b0C were then fabricated for further fuel cell performance tests. Fig. 9 shows the typical SEM micrograph of the fractured surfaces of an anode-supported fuel cell. The fuel cell was composed of an Ni + SDC anode with a thickness of \u223c0.5 mm, SDC electrolyte of \u223c30 \u03bcm, and BSCF + SDC cathode of 10 \u03bcm. Shown in Fig. 10 is the dependence of cell voltages and power densities on current densities of the cell tested at various temperatures between 500 and 600 \u00b0C with similar cell configuration as shown in Fig. 9 . Ambient air was applied as the cathode atmosphere and pure hydrogen as the fuel during the study. A maximum peak power density of 1050 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C with the open circuit voltage of \u223c0.84 V, which are comparable or even slightly better than results from the similar fuel cell based on the pure BSCF cathode [16] . At 500 \u00b0C, a promising peak power density of \u223c382 mW cm \u22122 was still reached. Shown in Fig. 11 are the electrochemical impedance spectra of the cell under OCV condition. It was mainly composed of two parts. The left arc (high frequency) is contributed of ohmic polarization, including the effective resistance between cathode and anode, the ohmic resistance of the connection leads, while the right arc (low frequency) is due to the total polarization resistance of electrodes including anode and cathode. An electrode resistance of only 0.048 and 0.25 \u03a9 cm 2 was observed at 600 and 500 \u00b0C, respectively, which are even smaller than the corresponding ASRs of the BSCF + SDC based on the symmetric cell configuration. This suggests that the cathode performance was even improved under the asymmetric cell condition on the one hand and negligible anode polarization on the other hand. 4 Conclusions Based on the above results the following conclusions could be made. The solid-state reaction between BSCF and SDC in the BSCF + SDC (70:30 in weight ratio) composite cathode is greatly contingent on the firing temperature. At 900 \u00b0C or lower, negligible reaction occurred. At \u223c1000 \u00b0C, the reaction occurred at the BSCF + SDC interface only, with the formation of the third phase of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite from the incorporation of Sm 3+ and Ce 3+ into the A-site of BSCF. When the firing temperature was elevated to \u223c1050 \u00b0C or higher, the reaction progressed throughout the entire cathode with the formation of (Ba,Sr,Ce,Sm)(Co,Fe)O 3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite, which had higher electronic conductivity than BSCF but worse activity for oxygen reduction due to the decrease in lattice size and oxygen vacancy concentration. Therefore, obvious increase of polarization resistance for oxygen reduction was observed when BSCF + SDC was fired at \u223c1100 \u00b0C. At a modest firing temperature of 1000 \u00b0C, the reaction occurred only at the interface of BSCF and SDC, which did not produce a detrimental effect on the oxygen reduction process; on the contrary, it resulted in good connection between the BSCF and SDC particles in the BSCF + SDC composite cathode and helped to reduce the interfacial resistance. Furthermore, the SDC enlarged the effective cathode surface area due to the higher surface area of SDC in comparison to BSCF. Therefore, an improved cathode performance was observed for the 1000 \u00b0C calcined BSCF + SDC composite cathode as compared to the pure phase BSCF. Complete fuel cells with the BSCF + SDC cathode fired from 1000 \u00b0C were then fabricated. A peak power density as high as 1050 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C.

        "abstract": "The potential application of combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process (ECCP) in intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) processing was investigated. ECCP-derived scandia-stabilized-zirconia (ScSZ) powder displayed low packing density, high surface area and nano-crystalline, which was ideal material for thin-film electrolyte fabrication based on dual dry pressing. A co-synthesis of NiO + ScSZ anode based on ECCP was developed, which showed reduced NiO(Ni) and ScSZ grain sizes and improved homogeneity of the particle size distribution, as compared with the mechanically mixed NiO + ScSZ anode. Anode-supported ScSZ electrolyte fuel cell with the whole cell materials synthesized from ECCP was successfully prepared. The porous anode and cathode exhibited excellent adhesion to the electrolyte layer. Fuel cell with 30 \u03bcm thick ScSZ electrolyte and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode showed a promising maximum peak power density of 350 mW cm \u22122 at 800 \u00b0C. Keywords IT-SOFCs Anode-supported ScSZ EDTA Citric acid Complexing 1 Introduction Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) convert chemical energy stored in fossil fuels to electrical power at elevated temperature in a highly efficient, silent and environmentally friendly way. They are believed to be a promising alternative power source to current internal combustion engine and coal burning power plant. Nowadays, there is a general tendency to reduce the SOFC operating temperature due to the benefits of prolonged operational life time, reduced reactivity between cell components, more abundant selection in cell materials and less fabrication and material cost [1\u20135] . In order to obtain a high power density at intermediate-temperature (IT), e.g. , 600\u2013800 \u00b0C, besides the requirement of a powerful cathode, thin-film electrolyte configuration and development of new electrolyte material with high ionic conductivity are proposed [6\u201310] . With the reduction of membrane thickness from millimeter level to several tens of micrometer, substrate-supported configuration is needed for sufficient mechanical strength. Considering the much higher thermal conductivity and mechanical strength of cermet anode than the composite oxide cathode, the anode-supported configuration is preferred. Up to now, the main obstacle for commercialization of SOFCs is still the high material and processing cost. The development of a simple, high efficient and cheap fabrication and processing technique for anode-supported thin-film-electrolyte fuel cell is important in realizing the IT-SOFC technology. On the other hand, it was found that the fuel cell performance is also strongly process dependent [11\u201313] . The microstructure, morphology and conductivity of the electrodes as well as the electrode|electrolyte interface, which determine the fuel cell performance, are closely related with the fabrication techniques. And particularly important is the powder preparation process. Among the various synthesis processes, wet-chemical methods have significant advantage over traditional solid-state reaction, including high purity, accurate material composition, tunable microstructure and high sintering activity of the powder. Sol\u2013gel method based on combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process (ECCP) has been found to be a promising technique for the synthesis of a wide range of composite oxides [14\u201317] . It allows the metal ions mixed in the molecule level, therefore a nano-crystalline powder with high surface area can be easily obtained at low calcination temperature. It is a simple, economically attractive method for the synthesis of advanced materials with high performance. In this paper, we investigated the potential application of ECCP in SOFC processing. The fabrication of anode-supported IT-SOFCs via a dual dry pressing process with the whole cell materials synthesized from ECCP was systematically studied. Scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) was selected as the electrolyte material since it shows the highest ionic conductivity among the zirconia-based oxide materials [18] . A co-synthesis process based on ECCP for the preparation of NiO + ScSZ mixed powder for anode application was also proposed and investigated. Through optimizing powder preparation parameters and the sintering procedure, a NiO + ScSZ supported thin-film ScSZ electrolyte fuel cell with LSM cathode was successfully prepared and delivered promising performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Powder synthesis and fuel cell fabrication La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM), (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) and NiO + ScSZ (60:40 wt.%) were selected as the cathode, electrolyte and anode composition, respectively. Except for NiO, which is readily available (Shanghai Hengxin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.,) and was sometimes used, all the other materials were synthesized via a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process (ECCP). The general procedure for the synthesis based on ECCP was schematically described in Fig. 1 . The synthesis of LSM was taken as an example as follows. Required amounts of analytic reagents of La(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 and Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 according to the stoichiometry of the composite, were prepared into a mixed solution under stirring. EDTA\u2013NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O and citric acid were added to the solution in sequence at the mole ratio of total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid of 1:1:2. NH 4 OH was applied to adjust the pH value of the solution to be around 6 during the water evaporation. Under stirring and heating, a clear viscous gel was finally obtained, which was solidified by pre-heating at 250 \u00b0C for several hours and finally calcined at 900 \u00b0C to obtain the pure-phase perovskite oxide with the nominated composition of LSM. Two types of anode powders were applied for the fuel cell fabrication. Anode A was prepared by the mechanical mixing of commercial NiO powder and ScSZ oxide (synthesized from ECCP) at the weight ratio of 60:40, with the help of a high energy ball miller (Pulrverize 7) at the rotation of 400 rpm for 30 min in acetone media. Anode B was co-synthesized based on ECCP with stoichiometric amounts of the metal nitrates of Sc(NO 3 ) 3 , Zr(NO 3 ) 4 and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 , according to the elemental composition of NiO + ScSZ (60:40 wt.%), mixed in the solution stage. The anode-supported single cell was fabricated by the dry pressing/sintering of the anode\u2013electrolyte dual layer and spray deposition/firing of the cathode layer. Anode powder was first pressed into a substrate disk using a stainless steel die under a hydraulic pressure of 120 MPa. ScSZ powder calcined from 900 \u00b0C was distributed over the anode surface homogenously and followed by a second press under a hydraulic pressure of 240 MPa to form the green dual layer cell, which was then sintered at 1400\u20131500 \u00b0C for 5 h to densify the electrolyte layer. The cathode layer was deposited over the electrolyte surface by air-driven spray deposition of cathode colloid, followed by calcinations at 1150 \u00b0C for 2 h to form well-connected cathode network and good adhesion to the electrolyte layer. 2.2 Fuel cell performance test The electrode performance was investigated with a symmetrical cell or complete cell configuration by the ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation Solartron 1287 potentiostat and a 1260A frequency response analyzer. The frequency range applied was from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions. The overall impedance data were fitted by a complex non-linear least square (CNLS) fitting program in ZView 2.9b software. I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 digital source meter based on the four-terminal configuration. The fuel cell was sealed onto a quartz tube reactor with the cathode side exposed to ambient air. Pure hydrogen at a flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 [STP] was fed into the anode chamber as fuel and the ambient air acted as the cathode atmosphere. Ag paste was adopted as the current collector. 2.3 Characterization The phase structure of the oxide samples from various conditions were observed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes were characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM, QUATA-2000) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) attachment. The specific surface areas of the samples were characterized by N 2 adsorption using a BELSORP II instrument at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and properties of the powders ECCP was found to be a convenient method for the synthesis of LSM and ScSZ oxides. Fig. 2 a and b shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the two powders prepared from calcination of their ECCP solid precursors at various temperatures in air for 5 h. Pure-phase perovskite or fluorite was obtained at a calcination temperature as low as 500 \u00b0C, both for LSM and ScSZ. During the phase formation, no other oxide(s) except perovskite (for LSM) or fluorite (for ScSZ) appeared. It suggests that the molecule-level homogeneous mixing of the metal ions in the solution stage was successfully preserved into the solid precursor of LSM/ScSZ, thanks to the highly non-ion-selective chelating capability of EDTA/citric acid with metal ions and the space effect of EDTA\u2013citrate polymerization to prevent the re-crystallization of metal nitrates [17] . Consequently, a high homogeneity of the elemental composition of the oxides was obtained. It is well known that the electrical properties of conducting oxide are highly sensitive to its elemental composition, structure and phase purity [19] . A small deviation from the elemental composition or the introduction of a minor amount of impurity phases may result in a significant deterioration of the electronic or ionic conductivity of the oxide [20,21] . The capacity for the precise elemental composition control and the high phase purity of the resulting oxides make the ECCP an attractive powder synthesis process for a lot of advanced applications including solid-oxide fuel cells. The average particle sizes of the synthesized LSM and ScSZ powders from ECCP were evaluated from X-ray line broadening analysis using the Scherrer equation: t = 0.9 \u03bb B \u2009 cos \u2009 \u03b8 . Table 1 lists the calculated crystalline sizes and also the measured specific surface areas for LSM and ScSZ oxides. For both materials, nano-crystalline oxides with high surface area were observed. For example, a surface area as high as 9 and 15 m 2 g \u22121 was achieved at a calcination temperature of 700 \u00b0C for the ScSZ and LSM oxides, respectively. The corresponding crystalline sizes are \u223c11 and 15 nm, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of ECCP-ScSZ powder calcination from 900 \u00b0C for 5 h. The oxide was foam-like and very loose in nature with considerable amount of gas trapped inside the powder. It was very easy to be crashed to fine powder, suggesting the soft-aggregation nature of the powder. 3.2 Anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fabrication The fabrication of the anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cell is the key technology in realizing the intermediate-temperature SOFCs. Dual dry pressing has been found to be a convenient, simple and highly efficient way for the fabrication of anode-supported thin-film electrolyte SOFCs [22\u201324] . The key point in realizing this process is to prepare electrolyte powder with low packing density and high sintering activity. The packing density, which is defined as the ratio of the apparent density of the packed powder to the theoretical density of the oxide, for the 900 \u00b0C-calcined ScSZ was found to be as low as 3% due to the soft-aggregation. It means that the powder can be packed to a thickness of \u223c0.6 mm in order to obtain a 20 \u03bcm thick dense electrolyte layer. Such a big packing thickness allowed the homogeneous distribution of the electrolyte powder over the anode surface. We know there were a plenty amount of organics (EDTA, citric acid) presented in the solid precursor of ECCP-ScSZ. A huge amount of gas was produced from the combustion of the organics during the calcination. For example, the synthesis of 1 g ScSZ led to the formation of 0.58 mol CO 2 , H 2 O and N 2 . The gas products prohibited the contacting between the ScSZ particles during the powder synthesis; consequently the material sintering was effectively suppressed and the oxide powder with nano-crystalline and high surface was obtained. The gases also created a huge amount of pores inside the soft-agglomerated powder and resulted in the low packing density of the oxide. Although ECCP-derived ScSZ was able to sinter to dense electrolyte at a temperature of \u223c1400 \u00b0C, just similar to the electrolyte powder from most other wet-chemical methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, considering the higher electrolyte conductivity with higher sintering temperature, and also the best matching of the shrinkage of anode layer and electrolyte layer for a flat fuel cell during sintering, a sintering temperature of 1500 \u00b0C was selected in current investigation. Fig. 4 shows a fractional SEM micrograph of the anode-supported thin-layer electrolyte membrane sintered from 1500 \u00b0C, the anode here was not reduced, i.e. in the composition of NiO + ScSZ. The electrolyte membrane had a thickness of around 30 \u03bcm, which fixed to the anode substrate pretty well. It suggests that ECCP is an ideal synthesis process of electrolyte powders for the fuel cell fabrication based on the dual dry pressing. By applying this low packing density and highly sinter-active powder for the dual dry pressing process, it was facile for us to prepare anode-supported SOFC with electrolyte thickness as thin as 10 \u03bcm. Schematically described in Fig. 5 was the mechanism of preparing the thin-film electrolyte via the dual dry pressing of the ECCP-ScSZ powders with low packing density and high sintering activity. The powder from ECCP was in a highly soft-aggregated status and has very low packing density, which resulted in a thick packing layer on the anode surface for a thin dense layer of electrolyte. The mechanical press led to the crash of the soft-agglomerate and the elimination of the trapped gases from the powder, consequently a compactly packed layer of nano-electrolyte powder with a high green density was obtained. The measured green density after pressing for the green ScSZ layer reached >60%, as compared to a theoretical value of 74.5% assuming the uniform sphere shape of the particles and a close hexagonal packing. A relative low sintering temperature resulted in the densification of the ScSZ layer due to the high green density and surface activity of the electrolyte powder. The dual dry pressing also resulted in the fairly good contact between anode and electrolyte, which is beneficial to reduce the interfacial polarization resistance. 3.3 Fabrication and sintering behavior of LSM cathode layer The 900 \u00b0C-calcined LSM synthesized from ECCP (ECCP-LSM) was adopted for the cathode layer fabrication. It was first ball-milled and prepared into a colloidal suspension, subsequently deposited onto the electrolyte surface by spray coating, and finally fired at 1150 \u00b0C for 5 h in stagnant air. Fig. 6 shows the SEM micrograph of the cathode\u2013electrolyte dual layer. The cathode also adhered to the electrolyte surface very well. The cathode was in porous state with highly homogeneous grain and pore sizes with a main grain size of \u223c200 nm. It is well known that the activation polarization of the fuel cell electrode is related to charge transfer process and depends on the length of electrode/electrolyte/gas triple phase boundary (TPB). Increasing the TPB by decreasing the particle sizes of the phases is one way to minimize activation polarization. A relative high surface area and small crystalline size means more reaction sites for oxygen reduction; therefore an increased TPB length of current LSM cathode is expected. As the cathode layer for anode-supported SOFC, a high temperature firing is usually necessary in order to obtain a sufficient contact with electrolyte. Typically, a firing temperature of >1250 \u00b0C for LSM was reported in order to get a sufficient mechanical strength and the good adhesion of the cathode layer to the electrolyte surface [25,26] . Unfortunately, a solid-state reaction between LSM and ScSZ electrolyte occurs with the formation of insulating zirconate phases such as SrZrO 3 under such high calcination temperature firing [27,28] . Due to the nano-crystalline size and high surface area, the ECCP-LSM showed high surface activity, a calcination temperature as low as 1100 \u00b0C was found to sufficiently make it well adhere to the electrolyte surface. Such a low firing temperature greatly suppressed the phase reaction between LSM and ScSZ electrolyte during the fabrication of the cathode layer and resulted in an interlayer-free cathode\u2013electrolyte interface. 3.4 Co-synthesis of NiO + ScSZ for anode application Solid-oxide fuel cell anode is typically composed of Ni and an oxygen ionic conducting phase (typically same to the electrolyte), for example Ni + ScSZ. Here, nickel serves as an excellent catalyst for the oxidation of hydrogen and provides electronic conductivity for the anode. ScSZ here has two functions: on the one hand it helps reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of the anode and thus makes it mechanically more compatible with the electrolyte; on the other hand it provides the ionic pathway in the anode to extend the three phase boundaries for the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrogen. Traditionally NiO + ScSZ have been obtained by mechanical mixing of NiO and ScSZ oxides. First ScSZ mixed oxide was prepared by various synthesis methods, such as ECCP in this study. ScSZ and NiO were then mixed thoroughly by mechanical force for a sufficient time. It is well known that the anode microstructure could have a significant effect on anode polarization. The morphologies of the NiO and ScSZ particles then play an important role in the conductivity and microstructure of the anode and the performance of the anode, which is determined by the particle sizes of NiO and ScSZ and also their mixing status. The mechanical mixing allows for accurate chemical composition but may lead to inhomogeneities within the anode microstructure, causing separation of the NiO and ScSZ particles during anode process. One advantage of ECCP may be adopted for the co-synthesis of the NiO + ScSZ anode. Fig. 7 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the co-synthesized NiO + ScSZ powders based on ECCP. After the calcination of the solid precursor at 500 \u00b0C for 5 h, the product started to display a mixed phases of NiO and ScSZ with no reaction products between NiO and ScSZ appeared, suggesting the feasibility of the co-synthesis for anode application. Co-synthesis is characterized by the molecule-level homogeneous mixing of the metal ions at the solution stage, which may be helpful for an improved microstructure of the resulted NiO + ScSZ anode. Shown in Fig. 8 a and b is a comparison of the microstructure of the Ni + ScSZ anode (reduced) prepared by simple mechanical mixing or by ECCP. ECCP allows the raw materials mixed in the molecule level, therefore ensuring the phase homogeneity and a low calcination temperature for obtaining a pure-phase composite oxide. NiO is a simple binary oxide; applying ECCP to synthesize NiO has no advantage since combustion is necessary to burn out the organic in the precursor, while the heat then produced during the combustion could result in the sintering of NiO. Therefore, we use commercial fine NiO oxide (\u223c10 m 2 g \u22121 ) as the anode for mechanical mixing instead of ECCP-derived (<5 m 2 g \u22121 ). The same sintering temperature of 1500 \u00b0C was applied for this investigation. It indicates that the co-synthesized Ni + ScSZ anode had relatively finer ScSZ and Ni particles and higher degree of homogeneous mixing than the mechanically mixed one. Fig. 8 c and d further shows the morphologies of the corresponding Ni-depleted anodes after etching with nitric acid. It is evident that the ScSZ and NiO phases in anode based on co-synthesized sample were in a smaller grain size and more homogeneous grain size distribution. The ScSZ grains were well connected and formed a continuous network, which ensured the ionic conductivity passage. Since the activation polarization depends on the TPB, the decreased grain size resulted in the increase of the TPB; therefore an increased anode performance could be expected via the co-synthesis process. Furthermore, we can take the advantage of the considerable organic in the solid precursor during co-synthesis. The organic in the solid precursor can be decomposed to carbon under the oxygen deficient condition and acts as the in situ pore former. It is well known that co-firing of the electrodes to the electrolyte must be performed in order to ensure good contact between the two layers. The synthesis of electrolyte and anode materials by the same ECCP ensured the similar sintering behavior of the oxides, which produced an anode/electrolyte or interface with improved mechanical adherence and conductivity, therefore leading to lower polarization losses at the anode. It may be an additional advantage for SOFC application. 3.5 Performance of anode-supported single cell Through optimizing synthesis and fabrication parameters, an anode-supported single cell was successfully fabricated with the whole cell materials synthesized from ECCP, as a comparison, the fuel cell with anode from mechanical mixing was also fabricated. The typical single cell was shown in Fig. 9 . The anode-supported thin-film electrolyte dual layer was fabricated based on dry pressing at a sintering temperature of 1500 \u00b0C with an electrolyte thickness of \u223c30 \u03bcm. The cathode was applied by spray deposition and fired at 1150 \u00b0C. Powders of Ni + ScSZ anodes, ScSZ electrolytes and LSM cathodes were calcined at 700, 900 and 1000 \u00b0C, respectively. An anode porosity of 21%, measured by Archimedes method using water as the liquid media was observed. We applied 5 wt.% PVA as the pore former during the fabrication. The relative low anode porosity might be related with the high sintering temperature of 1500 \u00b0C. Fig. 10 shows the typical I \u2013 V curves of the fuel cell with the whole cell materials prepared by the ECCP, and also the fuel cell with the anode from mechanical mixing of commercial NiO and ECCP-ScSZ. An OCV of 1.1 V was achieved at 850 \u00b0C for both fuel cells, which is close to the theoretical value of 1.128 V, suggesting totally densified electrolyte layer (without penetrating hole) and the effective sealing. With the decrease of operating temperature, the OCV increased, which agreed well with the theoretical calculation results. A peak power density of 520 and 350 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 850 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively, for the fuel cells with whole materials from ECCP. It is slightly better than that with anode prepared from mechanical mixing, which show a peak power density of 500 and 300 mW cm \u22122 at 850 and 800 \u00b0C, respectively. The results obtained here are comparable or even higher than the results reported in literature for the fuel cells with the similar composition but with different synthesis and fabrication techniques [29] . No significant diffusion polarization was observed based on the I \u2013 V curves of the fuel cells ( Fig. 10 ), especially for the ECCP co-synthesized anode. It suggests that the homogeneous pore size of anode derived from the ECCP co-synthesis process allows the efficient gas diffusion inside the anode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the whole cells is shown in Fig. 11 . The impedance spectroscopy was composed of two selections, the ohmic resistance ( R ohm ) and the activation resistance (a sum of the anode and cathode). A value of 0.35 \u03a9 cm 2 for R ohm was observed for the current 30 \u03bcm ScSZ electrolyte, which was even larger than that of typical YSZ electrolyte with the same thickness (0.15 \u03a9 cm 2 ). Actually, R ohm here is the overall ohmic resistances including the electrolyte resistance, the electrode ohmic resistance, the electrode-current collector contacting resistance and the lead resistance. Therefore, the measured R ohm did not simply reflect the electrolyte resistance. According to Fig. 11 , the main loss of the fuel cell came from the electrode polarization. It is easy to understand since LSM is a poor ionic conductor, its electrode activity decreased sharply with decreasing temperature. The development of new cathode material with higher cathode activity at reduced temperature is the most critical for the further improvement of the performance. However, it is out the scope of this paper. 4 Conclusions In this paper we successfully applied a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing method in the synthesis of IT-SOFC materials, including NiO + ScSZ anode, LSM cathode and ScSZ electrolyte, which were then applied in the fabrication of anode-supported thin-film SOFCs. A ScSZ powder with low packing density, high surface area and nano-crystalline was obtained, which was ideal for dual dry pressing process for the fabrication of anode-supported thin-film electrolyte. The co-synthesis process eliminated the step of mechanical mixing for obtaining a NiO + ScSZ composite and resulted in an improved homogeneity and reduced grain sizes of Ni and ScSZ, which was beneficial for an improved anode performance. A single cell with the whole materials from ECCP with the electrolyte thickness down to 30 \u03bcm and good adhesion of cathode and anode to the electrolyte layer was successfully fabricated, which showed very promising performance of \u223c350 mW cm \u22122 at 800 \u00b0C applied H 2 as fuel. It suggests that ECCP has promising application in the SOFC fabrication.

A complexing sol-gel process was applied to synthesize the B1\u00b1xZCY4 powders. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the well-calcined powders indicate that the specimens with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.10 possessed a single-phase of orthorhombic perovskite-type oxides. Additionally, impurity phases of (Y,Ce)O2-\u03b4 existed in B 1-xZCY4, and BaCO3 was found in B1+xZCY4 with x = 0.15 and 0.20. After sintering at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h, all B 1+xZCY4 samples became pure phased, whereas impurities still existed in samples with large Ba deficiencies. A study of the sintering behavior showed that the proper amount of Ba excess or deficiency facilitated electrolyte densification and that a large Ba nonstoichiometry hindered sintering. The electrical conductivities of B1\u00b1xZCY4 specimens with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.05 were studied in the temperature range of 100-700 \u00b0C, and the results showed that the Ba nonstoichiometry influenced the electrical conductivity, especially with respect to grain boundary resistance. The chemical stability was also studied using temperature-programmed CO2 desorption, and it was determined that the chemical stability was affected by the Ba content. \u00a9 2011 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The weight ratio of nickel oxide to SDC in the synthesis process was found to have significant effect on both the crystallite size and the textural properties of the resulted SDC powder. In particular, when it was at 9, the thermally stable and well-crystallized SDC powder showed a mesoporous structure with narrow pore-size distribution, high surface area (77 m 2 g \u22121 ) and large pore volume (\u223c0.2276 cm 3 g \u22121 ), even after the calcination at 700 \u00b0C for 3 h. The mesoporous SDC was found to favor free gas diffusion with no gas diffusion polarization occurred even at high current density both for hydrogen and methane fuels. The SOFC with Ru impregnated mesoporous SDC catalytic layer displayed promising performance with a peak power density of \u223c462 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C. Keywords Doped ceria Mesoporous Methane Catalyst Solid-oxide fuel cells 1 Introduction Fuel cells are attractive power-generation technologies that directly and efficiently convert chemical energy to electrical power via the silent and environmental friendly electrochemical way. For most of the fuel cells, high-purity hydrogen is usually required as the fuel. However, due to the lack of public hydrogen production, storage and transportation infrastructure, the wide spread of hydrogen fuel cell may not be so optimistic within the next few decades. The much more matured infrastructure of gasoline and home gas system makes the hydrocarbon fuel cell more realistic in the near future. Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are such kind of fuel cells that can operate directly with hydrocarbon fuel without the need of external reforming process. However, because of the less electrochemical activity of hydrocarbon than hydrogen over the typical nickel-based anode, a better performance electrochemical catalyst for hydrocarbon oxidation is necessary for practical application purpose. Ceria oxide has been found to be an excellent high-active catalyst for hydrocarbon oxidation and cracking [1\u20135] . Electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons using ceria-based anode has also been successfully reported [6\u20139] . For example, it demonstrated that the addition of CeO 2 to the anode of Cu\u2013Yttria stabilized zirconia/SDC cermets significantly enhanced the cell performance with hydrocarbon fuels [6] . Recently it was recognized that the ceria in mesoporous state could greatly improve the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation as compared to the bulk ceria [10\u201312] . Nonperiodic hierarchical mesoporosity coupled with nanocrystallinity has the potential to enhance mass transport, ionic and electronic mobility, and in particular maximize the three-phase-boundary (TPB) length in cathode or anode [12] . Significant improvement of fuel cell performance by applying mesoporous ceria catalytic layer has been demonstrated [13,14] . Up to now, undoped ceria was mostly applied as the electrocatalyst in SOFCs. Due to the poor ionic conductivity (<10 \u22124 S cm \u22121 ), it mainly functioned as the reforming/oxidation catalyst with improved gas diffusion properties but negligible contribution to the extension of the TPB length. The doping of CeO 2 with Sm 2 O 3 or Gd 2 O 3 leads to the substantially increase of the ionic conductivity to a level of \u223c0.01 S cm \u22121 at 600 \u00b0C and \u223c0.1 S cm \u22121 at 800 \u00b0C. Therefore, an increase of the fuel cell performance is possible from the extension of the TPB length by applying the doped ceria as the catalyst. For example, it was reported that the coating of the pores of Ni/ScSZ (scandia-stabilized zirconia) anode with 2 wt.% nano-sized Gd 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 conducting particles yielded much higher power density than that without the ceria modification [13] . The combination of high ionic conductivity and mesoporosity of the doped ceria may result in the substantially increase of the fuel cell performance. Therefore, in this study we are aimed at the synthesis of mesoporous SDC and the application of it as the electrocatalyst for reduced temperature methane-fueled SOFCs. In literature, several methods have been used for the preparation of mesoporous ceria powders [15\u201319] . In those methods, fine and mesoporous ceria powders were produced by applying relatively expensive surfactants and organic templates. Furthermore, the synthesized powders always showed poor thermal and mechanical stability, which greatly limited their application in SOFCs. Here, we reported an innovative in situ inorganic templating process for the facile synthesis of mesoporous nano-crystalline SDC power with high thermal stability. A glycine-nitrate combustion process (GNP) with in situ created nickel oxide as the agglomeration inhibitor and template was applied for the synthesis of mesoporous SDC powders. The method takes the advantages of cheap raw material, fast synthesis, recyclable inorganic template, high thermally stable and well-crystallized SDC. The as-prepared mesoporous SDC was loaded with Ru and applied as the catalytic layer for methane-fueled SOFCs operated at intermediate temperature with promising performance. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of SDC powder and fabrication of fuel cell MEA (Membrane-electrode-assembly) with catalyst layer A modified glycine-nitrate process was applied for the synthesis of mesoporous SDC, which was schematically shown in Fig. 1 . Stoichiometric amount of ceria nitrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O, >99%), samarium nitrate (Sm(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O, >99%) and nickel nitrate (Ni(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O, >99%), according to the aimed ratio, was prepared into a mixed aqueous solution in a Pyrex breaker. Glycine (NH 2 \u2013CH 2 \u2013COOH, 99%) was added to the mixed solution at the mole ratio of glycine:total metal ions at 2:1. The solution precursor was then heated at \u223c90 \u00b0C over a hot plate under vagarious magnetic stirring until a gel was obtained, which was then transferred to a heated oven at 250 \u00b0C for a self-sustaining combustion. After the reaction, the primary products were further calcined at 700 \u00b0C under stagnant air for 3 h at the heating/cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 to remove the carbon residues in the powders and form the well-crystallized powders. The as-obtained powders were then soaked with a 3 mol L \u22121 HNO 3 aqueous solution and heated at 90 \u00b0C for several hours under stirring. The nickel oxide in the powder was dissolved by the HNO 3 to leave a porous SDC powder, which was then filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol. The obtained nickel nitrate solution can be recycled and applied as the raw material for the next synthesis. The anode-supported cells with SDC as electrolyte were prepared by a dual dry-pressing process. Anode powder consisting of 60 wt.% NiO and 40 wt.% SDC was prepared by high energy ball milling (FRITSCH, Pulverisette 6) of the mixture of NiO and SDC. To fabricate a single cell, NiO\u2013SDC anode powder was firstly pressed as a substrate. SDC powder was added onto the substrate surface and pressed again to form a bi-layer pellet, which was then fired at 1350 \u00b0C to result in the densification of the electrolyte layer (area: \u223c1.25 cm 2 ). Slurry, consisting of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) (synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing method [20] ) + SDC (30 wt.% SDC), was applied to the electrolyte surface by painting method, which was subsequently calcined at 1000 \u00b0C under air atmosphere for 5 h to form a porous cathode layer (area: \u223c0.48 cm 2 ). For the single cell with the catalytic layer, slurry consisting of 7 wt.% Ru-loaded mesoporous SDC was applied onto the surface of NiO + SDC anode layer at 150 \u00b0C by screen painting method, followed by dried at 250 \u00b0C for 3 h and in situ calcined at 650 \u00b0C under hydrogen. The Ru-loaded SDC catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method. For a typical experiment, an appropriate amount of RuCl 3 and binder PVB was added to a suspension consisting of 0.5 g mesoporous SDC powder and 10 mL ethanol, followed by grinding for 30 min with an agate mortar and pestle and then well mixed by ultrasonic vibration for 1 h. 2.2 Characterization The lattice structure of the synthesized powders was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.54056 \u00c5). The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning at the range of 10\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 90\u00b0. The peak broadening effect was used to determine the average crystallite size according to the Scherrer equation. The N 2 adsorption measurement was performed using a BELSORP II instrument at the temperature of liquid nitrogen to determine the specific surface area, pore volume and pore-size distribution of the prepared powders. The specific surface area and the pore-size distribution were calculated based on the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Telley (BET) and Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. Before the measurement, the samples were pre-treated at 100 \u00b0C for 3 h under vacuum to remove the surface\u2013adsorbed species. The morphologies of the powders and the fuel cells were examined by an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, Quanta-2000). The fuel cell performance was tested by I\u2013V characterization using a digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2420) interfaced with computer for data acquisition. Three percentage of H 2 O humidified H 2 or CH 4 was used as the fuel and ambient air as the cathode atmosphere during the fuel cell test. 3 Results and discussion For the GNP combustion process, significant different combustion behaviors were observed with and without the presence of nickel nitrate in the precursor. It was volume combustion type for the case without the presence of nickel nitrate. The resulted powder took the color of light yellow. However, some black residual was also observed over the inner wall of the beaker, which suggests that the reaction was not completely finished. For the precursor with nickel nitrate, the combustion changed to a self-propagated type of reaction. It began along the inner wall of the beaker and propagated towards the middle. The resulted powder was very light in weight and took the morphological shape of branch and the color of gray. There was almost no residual observed over the wall of the beaker, suggesting the complete reaction of the materials. The reactions stopped in seconds for both cases. The phase purity and the lattice structure of the as-synthesized powders were then examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2 , it was established that the powders were composed of NiO and face-centered phase of SDC, both for the fresh combustion-synthesized powder and the powder after further calcination at 700 \u00b0C for 3 h. It suggests no phase reaction happened between nickel oxide and samaria oxide/ceria oxide. The higher peak intensity of the 700 \u00b0C calcined sample as compared to the fresh one suggests that the crystallinity increased after the further calcination. Well crystallinity is essential for the high oxygen ionic conductivity, therefore, the 700 \u00b0C calcined sample was adopted for the further investigation and application. The as-synthesized mixed powder of NiO and SDC was then soaked with 3N HNO 3 solution under heating. The NiO in NiO + SDC mixture was slowly dissolved and left behind a porous SDC powder. After the thoroughly washing and filtering, a pure-phase light-yellow SDC powder, as demonstrated by XRD examination, was obtained. The relative amount of nickel oxide applied in the synthesis was found to have significant effect on the properties of the SDC powder derived. For convenience, it is expressed as the weight ratio of NiO to SDC. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of SDC samples after calcined at 700 \u00b0C for 3 h prepared with different amount of nickel oxide in the precursor. It indicates that all the powders displayed the typical fluorite phase structure, suggesting nickel did not cast negative effect on the phase formation. However, the diffraction peaks were gradually broadened with the increase of the NiO to SDC weight ratio, suggesting the decrease of the crystallite size of SDC. The calculated values were 13.7, 9.3 and 6.7 nm (showed in Table 1 ) at the NiO to SDC weight ratio of 0, 1 and 9, respectively. Therefore, nickel oxide actually acted an inhibitor for the crystallite size growth of the SDC powders. As shown in Table 1 , the increase of NiO to SDC weight ratio also led to the increase of the surface area of the resulted SDC powder. A SDC powder with surface area as high as 77 m 2 g \u22121 , crystalline size of \u223c6.7 nm and a pore volume of \u223c0.2276 cm 3 g \u22121 was obtained at the NiO to SDC weight ratio of 9. As a comparison, a surface area of only \u223c15 m 2 g \u22121 with the crystalline size of \u223c13.7 nm and a pore volume of \u223c0.1165 cm 3 g \u22121 was observed for the corresponding powder without the NiO templating. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding BJH pore-size distribution curves (inset) of the as-synthesized SDC powders with different amount of NiO presence in the solid precursor are shown in Fig. 4 . With respect to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms for the samples a and b are rather similar in shape to the type II isotherms, which show a weak narrow loop and exhibit an increase in total pore volume adsorbed near p / p 0 = 1. However, the samples a and b show some differences in BJH pore-size distribution (insert in Fig. 4 a and b). The pore-size distribution of the sample a (as shown in the inset of Fig. 4 a) shows nearly non-pore structure with a quite wide pore-size distribution. Compared with the sample a, the sample b ( Fig. 4 b) shows a relatively narrow pore-size distribution. Much different from the samples a and b, the sample c displays completely different isotherms and pore-size distribution. It shows IUPAC type IV isotherms with sharp inflection of nitrogen adsorbed volume at p / p 0 about 0.65, indicating the existence of mesopores. According to the isotherms, the pore-size distribution of sample c (inset in Fig. 4 c) possesses mesopores with narrow pore-size distribution of mostly between 10 and 25 nm. Above results suggest that mesoporous SDC with high crystallinity and pore volume was able to be synthesized through the appropriate amount of in situ created NiO templating. The morphologies of the SDC powders, prepared at NiO to SDC weight ratio of 0:1, 1:1 and 9:1, are shown in Fig. 5 . The as-prepared SDC samples are in highly porous morphologic structure. The higher the NiO to SDC weight ratio the smaller the particle size was observed with a grain size of <100 nm for the sample prepared at the NiO/SDC weight ratio of 9. The highly porous structure of the powder together with the well nanocrystallinity is beneficial for a better performance electrocatalyst. The possible formation mechanism of the mesoporous SDC powders is shown in Fig. 6 . At the NiO/SDC weight ratio of 1, the NiO particles primarily acted as an agglomeration inhibitor. The in situ created NiO particles broke up the three-dimensional network of SDC at a certain extent and inhibited the growth of the SDC particles. Therefore, an increase in surface area of SDC was observed with increasing the amount of nickel in the precursor. But quite a few NiO particles were also contained inside the SDC particles. After the dissolving of NiO by HNO 3 solution, pores were formed. As compared to that at other ratios, the inhibiting effect of NiO increased obviously at the condition of NiO to SDC weight ratio of 9. Under such situation, NiO also performed as an inorganic template for the formation of the mesoporous SDC. The NiO formed a network with the SDC clusters contained inside the NiO network. Some NiO particles were relatively uniformly dispersed in the SDC clusters. Mesopores were formed after wiped off the NiO particles from SDC. The mesoporous SDC powder loaded with 7 wt.% Ru was then deposited onto the anode surface as the catalytic layer for the anode-supported SOFC. Fig. 7 shows the cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the MEA with the catalyst deposition after calcined at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h. The fuel cell was composed of four layers, the cathode layer with a thickness of 5\u201310 \u03bcm, the dense electrolyte layer with a thickness of \u223c30 \u03bcm, the anode SDC + NiO layer of \u223c500 \u03bcm, and the mesoporous SDC + Ru layer with a thickness of \u223c25 \u03bcm. The anode nickel was in nickel oxide state in Fig. 7 . It shows that the catalytic layer was in highly porous state and attached to the anode layer really well. Fig. 8 a shows the typical voltage and power density versus current density of a SOFC based on thin-film SDC electrolyte (\u223c30 \u03bcm) operated on 3% water humidified hydrogen at the flow rate of 90 mL min \u22121 , with a \u223c25 \u03bcm 7 wt.% Ru-loaded mesoporous SDC catalytic layer modified Ni + SDC anode and BSCF + SDC cathode. The fuel cell shows promising performance with a peak powder density of 850 and \u223c600 mW cm \u22122 at 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. The high performance of the fuel cell at intermediate temperatures with hydrogen fuel was resulted from the high activity of the cathode for oxygen reduction [21] and the anode for hydrogen oxidation. Comparable performance was also observed for the similar fuel cell without the catalyst layer (as shown in Fig. 8 b). It suggests that the catalytic layer did not cast significant negative effect on the fuel cell performance with hydrogen fuel. As pointed by Zhan and Barnett [10] , the drawback of typical CeO 2 \u2013Ru catalyst layer laid on its reduction of the rate at which fuel can diffuse to the anode. Based on Fig. 7 , the current Ru/SDC catalyst is in highly porous state, which ensures free gas transportation inside the catalytic layer. Furthermore, the pore size of 10\u201320 nm of the mesoporous SDC was about 25\u201360 times larger than the dynamic molecule radius of CO 2 , H 2 , CH 4 , O 2 and CO molecules, which ensured the free gas diffusion inside the internal pores of SDC of the catalytic layer. The highly porous structure of the catalytic layer and the mesoporous structure of the compositional material of SDC then ensured the fast gas diffusion inside the Ru/SDC catalytic layer. Therefore, no such gas diffusion limiting of the fuel cell performance was observed even at high current density in the current Ru/SDC catalyst-modified fuel cells. Fig. 9 shows the fuel cell performance with 3% H 2 O humidified methane as the fuel at the flow rate of 30 mL min \u22121 for the fuel cells with or without the catalytic layer. An initial peak powder density of \u223c369 mW cm \u22122 were generated by the fuel cell without the catalytic layer, while a power density of \u223c462 mW cm \u22122 were yielded by the fuel cell with a porous Ru/SDC catalytic layer at 650 \u00b0C. The fuel cell with the Ru/SDC layer performed relatively stable, while the performance of the fuel cell without the catalytic layer deteriorated quickly. It is well known that methane has much worse electrochemical activity than H 2 , especially at reduced temperature due to its much higher chemical stability. The promising fuel cell performance in current study was then attributed to the high activity of the Ru-loaded mesoporous SDC for methane electrocatalytical oxidation. As shown in Fig. 7 , no observable agglomerated Ru grain was observed by SEM, suggesting that Ru was homogeneously distributed over the pore-wall of the mesoporous SDC. It then ensured a large reaction area for methane oxidation. It is well known that Ru has high activity for water and CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas (CO + H 2 ) [22,23] , while SDC or ceria favors the catalytic oxidation of methane to CO 2 and H 2 O [1] . Therefore, in current methane-fueled SOFCs with Ru-loaded mesoporous SDC catalytic layer, it is likely that some methane was first oxidized to CO 2 and water under the electrocatalysis by the mesoporous SDC. Available additional methane was then internally reformed with the created water and CO 2 under the catalysis of Ru to form syngas (CO + H 2 ), which acted as the fuel for the following electrocatalytic oxidation. Since syngas has much higher electrochemical activity than methane, it then explained the observed favorable fuel cell performance even with methane fuel. Similar effect was also showed by Hibino et al. with the Ru\u2013Ni\u2013GDC anode. Furthermore, they achieved even higher performances as compared to the present results [23] . The detection of CO and H 2 species in the exhaust gas from the fuel cell by in situ gas chromatography supported the role of Ru in the internal reforming of methane to syngas. As we know, the carbon deposition may be a serious problem for the Ni-based anode directly operated on hydrocarbon fuels. After the tests, the fuel cells were conducted SEM examination. Some carbon coking was formed over the Ni + SDC anode surface for the fuel cell without the Ru/SDC layer, which well explained the quick deterioration of the fuel cell performance observed in this study. However, no observable carbon coking was formed over the anode surface of the catalyst-modified fuel cell. We finally noted that the OCVs were relatively lower as shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . One significant reason for this could be the internal shorting of the SDC electrolyte from its partial electronic conductivity [24] . Low OCVs were also reported by some other researchers with the anode-supported fuel cells based on doped ceria electrolyte [25\u201327] . Another possible reason is the mixed potential at the fuel cell cathode due to the gas leakage, which could be through the penetrated holes in the electrolyte layer or the silver sealant due to the imperfect sintering or sealing. Accordingly, the increment of the sintering temperature may eliminate the penetrated holes in electrolyte and be helpful to increase the OCV of the fuel cell. Indeed, we observed that when the sintering temperature of the electrolyte was elevated to 1450 \u00b0C, an OCV as high as 0.87 V or higher was observed at 600 \u00b0C. 4 Conclusion In this work, mesoporous SDC powders with high surface area (77 m 2 g \u22121 ) were prepared via a facile glycine-nitrate combustion process with recyclable in situ created NiO as the inorganic template. The increase of relative amount of nickel nitrate in synthesis, resulted in the substantially change of the properties of the derived SDC powder, such as surface area, pore volume, and pore-size distribution. This method shows special advantages, such as easy to operate and reduction in capital cost, when comparing other synthesis techniques. It eliminates the application of expensive surfactants and organic templates. Furthermore, the inorganic template nickel applied in this study can be recycled after preparation. Acted as the catalytic layer, the mesoporous SDC displayed good performance for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells with methane fuel.

        "abstract": "Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst is modified with Li 2 O 3 , La 2 O 3 and CaO promoters to improve its resistance to coking. These catalysts are used as the materials of the anode catalyst layer in solid-oxide fuel cells operating on methane. Their catalytic activity for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane at 600\u2013850 \u00b0C is investigated. Their catalytic stability and carbon deposition properties are also studied. The LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst shows a catalytic activity that is comparable to those of LaNi-Al 2 O 3 and LiNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts for all three reactions. However, it displays a higher catalytic activity than those of CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 and CaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Among the various catalysts, the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst presents the highest catalytic stability. O 2 -TPO profiles indicate that the modification of the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst with Li and La greatly reduces carbon deposition under pure methane atmosphere. The LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst is applied as the anode functional layer of a Ni + ScSZ anode-supported fuel cell. The cell is operated on methane-O 2 , methane-H 2 O or methane-CO 2 gas mixtures and yields peak power densities of 538, 532 and 529 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C, respectively, comparable to that of hydrogen fuel. In sum, the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 is highly promising as a highly coking resistant catalyst layer for solid-oxide fuel cells. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Anode Catalyst layer Methane Carbon deposition 1 Introduction Fuel cells are electrochemical energy conversion devices that directly convert chemical energy into electric power with high efficiency and low emissions. Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have all-solid components and operate at elevated temperatures with fuel flexibility. Besides hydrogen, more accessible chemicals such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and coal are all potential fuels of SOFCs [1\u20135] . Methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, is the main component of natural gas and coal-bed gas and the renewable resource of biogas. It is not only less expensive and more easily and safely stored than hydrogen but also more readily accessible. The utilization of methane in SOFC technology has a great practical importance in the reduction of energy consumption and green house emissions. SOFCs can operate on methane fuel according to three main operation modes. Pure methane can be directly fed into the fuel cell anode where it is electrocatalytically oxidized into CO 2 and H 2 O (CH 4 + 4O 2\u2212 \u2192 CO 2 + 2H 2 O + 8e \u2212 ) without intermediate reforming processes. Such types of fuel cells are called direct-methane SOFCs [6\u20139] . The main advantage of this operation mode is its simplicity. However, it also presents two main drawbacks, i.e., an easy coke formation over the nickel cermet anode (CH 4 \u2192 C + 2H 2 ) and a poor cell performance, which greatly inhibits the practical application of direct-methane SOFCs. Recently, considerable research efforts have been expended on the development of non-nickel anode materials with improved coking resistivity and high activity for direct electrochemical oxidation of methane [10\u201313] . However, the progress is still slow up to now, especially in increasing the power output at reduced temperatures. Another way to operate SOFCs on methane is to first convert methane into hydrogen by external reforming (CH 4 + 2H 2 O \u2192 CO 2 + 4H 2 ) [14\u201317] . In this operation mode, the actual fuel for the electrochemical oxidation over the fuel cell anode is hydrogen instead of methane. The advantages of this operation mode are that the conventional cermet anode can still be applied and that the cell performance is comparable to that operating on hydrogen. However, the external reforming greatly increases the complexity of the fuel cell system. Furthermore, the steam reforming of methane is highly energy intensive, which reduces the overall fuel efficiency. The internal reforming (or partial oxidation) of methane over the SOFC anode has recently attracted considerable attention [18\u201325] . In this operation mode, a gas mixture consisting of methane and steam (or CO 2 or O 2 ) is fed into the fuel cell anode, which performs as the catalyst for the steam reforming (partial oxidation) of methane to syngas. The advantages of internal reforming (partial oxidation) include a simpler operation mode and an easier thermal management than external reforming, and a higher cell performance and decreased sensitivity to coke formation than the direct-methane SOFCs. However, the state-of-the-art sintered nickel cermet anode has a poor catalytic activity towards methane and steam/CO 2 reforming and partial oxidation, especially at reduced temperatures; in addition, coke is easily formed over the sintered nickel cermet. The development of alternative anodes is therefore critical for the SOFC technology that is based on the internal reforming (partial oxidation) of methane. The modification of conventional SOFC cermet anodes is more practical than the development of totally new anode materials due to its simplicity. Recently, the deposition of a layer of a catalyst possessing a high activity for the reforming (partial oxidation) of methane and a good resistance towards coke formation on a conventional cermet anode was proposed to increase the operational stability and performance of hydrocarbon-fueled SOFCs [26\u201328] . In this operation mode, hydrocarbons first pass through the functional layer where they are converted to syngas (CO + H 2 ) over the catalyst layer. Thus, as hydrocarbons are converted before they can reach the anode, and the conventional anode is well protected from carbon deposition. Barnett and colleagues have first demonstrated that Ru-CeO 2 can be used as the catalyst layer [26] . The cell power output and anode coke resistance of fuel cells with a Ru-CeO 2 functional layer were obviously better than those of cells without a catalyst layer and operating on methane, propane or octane fuels [26,29,30] . However, the high cost of Ru is a handle for SOFC application. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that an inexpensive Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst has a catalytic activity for the partial oxidation, steam reforming, and CO 2 reforming of methane between 600 and 850 \u00b0C that is comparable to that of Ru-CeO 2 [31,32] . Furthermore, the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer showed a much better mechanical performance than Ru-CeO 2 . However, Ni-Al 2 O 3 is still prone to coke formation even though only a small amount of carbon was deposited over the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer in a real fuel cell after operation on methane for a period of 2.5 h which was due to the low nickel loading in the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Thus, the coke resistance of the functional layer must still be improved for long-term operations. It is well known that the catalytic activity and coking resistivity of nickel catalysts is strongly influenced by the support and the promoters. Some lanthanum ions or alkaline metal ions were found to be good promoters for nickel catalysts to obtain improved catalytic activity and carbon resistance [33\u201339] . For example, it was reported that Li and La-modified Ni catalysts that were supported on \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 had a high catalytic activity for the partial oxidation of methane [40\u201342] . To further increase the catalytic activity for the internal reforming of methane (partial oxidation) and coke resistance of the functional layer, La 2 O 3 , Li 2 O and CaO were selected in this study as promoters for the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. A comparative study of various catalysts for the steam reforming, CO 2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane between 600 and 850 \u00b0C is presented herein. Finally, the performance of the Li and La-modified Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst as the functional layer on the anode in a fuel cell operating on methane was studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication All the catalyst powders investigated in this study as the materials for the catalyst layer were synthesized by a glycine nitrite process (GNP) [43] . Taking the synthesis of the Li and La co-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst as an example, stoichiometric amounts of nickel nitrate, lanthanum nitrate, lithium nitrate and alumina nitrate were dissolved in de-ionized water to form a solution; glycine was then added at a molar ratio of glycine to total metallic cations of 2. The solution was heated on a hot plate under stirring to evaporate water until a gel precursor was obtained. This gel precursor was then transferred to a pre-heated electric oven at 240 \u00b0C to initialize auto-combustion. The as-resulted primary powder was further calcined at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h in static air. After cooling to room temperature, the powder was pressed into disks and crashed to small pellets with desired particle size for catalytic tests. The fuel cell materials, including the cathode La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) and the electrolyte (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ), were prepared by an EDTA-citrate complexing process [44] . The fuel cell used in this study was a 60 wt.% NiO + 40 wt.% ScSZ cermet anode-supported thin-film ScSZ electrolyte fuel cell (\u223c20 \u03bcm), fabricated by a dual dry-pressing/sintering process. The NiO + ScSZ anode powder was first pressed into a substrate disk using a stainless steel die under a hydraulic pressure of 120 MPa. Ultrafine ScSZ powder with a low packing density was then homogenously distributed over the anode surface and a second press under a pressure of 240 MPa was applied to form a green dual layer cell that was sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h to densify the electrolyte layer. The sintered cells had a diameter of \u223c13 mm and a thickness of \u223c0.3 mm. To prepare the catalyst layer, a slurry of the catalyst powder was prepared, painted onto the outer surface of the anode layer, and sintered at 850 \u00b0C in air for 1 h. 2.2 Catalytic evaluation The catalytic activity of the various nickel-based catalysts was studied in a flow-through type of a fixed-bed, quartz-tube reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c8 mm. The test was performed between 600 and 850 \u00b0C. About 0.2 g of catalyst particles having a size of 60\u201380 mesh were put in the middle of the reactor. Gas mixtures were fed into the reactors at a flow rate of CH 4 /O 2 /He = 10/5/80, CH 4 /H 2 O/He = 10/10/80 and CH 4 /CO 2 /He = 10/10/80 ml min \u22121 [STP] for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane, respectively. The flow rate was controlled using AFC 80MD digital mass flow controllers (Qualiflow). The gas mixtures were introduced from the top of the reactor; the effluent gases at the bottom of the reactor were introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph, which was equipped with Hayesep Q, Poraplot Q and 5 \u00c5 sieve molecular capillary columns and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the separation and detection of H 2 , O 2 , CO, CO 2 and CH 4 species. Conversion of methane ( X (%)) during partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming was calculated according to the following equations: (1) X ( % ) = [ CO ] + [ CO 2 ] [ CO ] + [ CO 2 ] + [ CH 4 ] \u00d7 100 % (2) X ( % ) = 0.5 [ CO ] 0.5 [ CO ] + [ CH 4 ] \u00d7 100 % While the selectivity of CO (S (%)) was calculated according to: (3) S ( % ) = [ CO ] [ CO ] + [ CO 2 ] \u00d7 100 % 2.3 Other characterizations The phase structures of the various catalysts were examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, ARL X \u2032 TRA) equipped with a Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.1541 nm). The BET specific surface area of the catalysts was characterized by N 2 adsorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using a surface area analyzer (BELSORP II, Japan). Prior to nitrogen adsorption, the sample was degassed at 300 \u00b0C for 2.0 h to remove any physically adsorbed species. The surface area was determined from the linear portion of the BET equation. The cross-sectional morphologies of the fuel cells were examined using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-200). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) was performed to identify the interaction between NiO and the support (promoter). Approximately 0.03 g of 60\u201380 mesh catalyst powder was placed in a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm. The sample was pretreated under a pure argon atmosphere at a flow rate of 30 ml min \u22121 for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the gas was switched to a gas mixture of 10 vol.% H 2 in argon, and then the reactor was heated to 930 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The consumption of hydrogen was monitored by an on-line TCD detector using a BELCAT-A apparatus (Japan). To test the coke resistivity of the various catalysts, about 0.05 g of catalyst after the treatment in various methane-contained atmospheres for a certain period were placed into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm. Pure oxygen (for oxygen temperature-programmed oxidization, O 2 -TPO) at a flow rate of 20 ml min \u22121 [STP] was then introduced from the top of the reactor. After flowing \u223c30 min at room temperature, the reactor was heated to 800 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The deposited carbon on the catalyst surface was gradually oxidized to CO 2 . The effluent gas from the reactor was connected to a Hiden QIC-20 Mass Spectroscope (MS) for in situ monitoring of the CO 2 concentration variation. 2.4 Electrochemical characterization The cell performance was characterized by I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P polarization. The fuel cell was first sealed onto a quartz tube and was then slowly heated to 850 \u00b0C using an electric furnace. During the heating process, both the anode and cathode were exposed to ambient air. After stabilization at 850 \u00b0C for several hours, the anode atmosphere was changed to fuel gas, i.e., pure methane or a gas mixture containing either CH 4 \u2013O 2 , CH 4 \u2013CO 2 or CH 4 \u2013H 2 O, at a flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P polarization tests were performed in 4-probe mode and the curves were recorded using a Keithley 2420 source meter. After the test at 850 \u00b0C was completed, the temperature was dropped to another temperature for I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P tests. The measurement was conducted at 25 \u00b0C per step until 750 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Basic properties An ideal material for the catalyst layer of SOFCs operating on methane should have a high activity for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane. We have previously demonstrated that a Ni-Al 2 O 3 (7 wt.% Ni) catalyst prepared by a glycine-nitrate combustion process had a good activity for the afore-mentioned three reactions at intermediate temperatures. To further improve the catalytic performance, La 2 O 3 , Li 2 O and CaO were applied as promoters to modify the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Five new catalysts, i.e., LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LiNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 and CaNi-Al 2 O 3 were thus prepared by the same glycine-nitrate combustion method. For the GNP, the combustion is in a self-propagated manner, therefore, in some cases, the reaction may be not well controllable. However, by precisely controlling the reaction parameters, the reaction could be made with good repeatability. For example, the oxidation\u2013reduction reaction is sensitive to the ratio of glycine to cations [45] . The flame temperature is strongly affected by the ratio of glycine to metal [46,47] . During the experiment, the ratio of glycine to metal was strictly kept at 2.0 for all the catalysts. To ensure the high homogeneity of the catalyst, the as-obtained catalyst from the GNP was further conducted the calcination at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h. For comparison, Ni-Al 2 O 3 was also synthesized. After the direct combustion synthesis, all the catalysts were further calcined at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. Details about the catalyst compositions are listed in Table 1 . In all catalysts, the nickel content was fixed at 7 wt.% and the molar ratio of the total amount of promoters to the amount of nickel was fixed at 0.82:1. The XRD results are shown in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, the \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 crystalline phase was detected for all samples. No other phase, including NiO, was observed. These results suggest that La, Li and Ca were all well dispersed within the catalysts. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by the nitrogen adsorption method at liquid nitrogen temperature. The values for the specific surface areas were 66.7, 16.2, 40.8, 16.4, 14.3 and 48.0 m 2 g \u22121 for LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LiNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaNi-Al 2 O 3 and Ni-Al 2 O 3 , respectively. It is obvious that the promoters and their concentrations influenced the specific surface area of each catalyst. El-shobaky et al. have demonstrated that the BET specific surface area slightly decreases with an increasing amount of Li 2 O for Li 2 O-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts [48] . Our results are well in agreement with their findings even though different catalysts and synthetic techniques were applied in both cases. It is interesting that LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 had the highest specific surface area, while LaNi-Al 2 O 3 had the lowest. Chen et al. studied in detail the effect of La 2 O 3 on the specific surface area of the Al 2 O 3 support [49] . They found that the surface area is closely related to the so-called atomic ratio of lanthanum to aluminum (La/Al). Indeed, for La/Al \u2264 0.02, the specific surface area of the La 2 O 3 -promoted Al 2 O 3 samples was higher than that of the pure Al 2 O 3 sample after calcination at the same temperature. The maximum specific surface area was achieved at a La/Al atomic ratio of 0.02. For La/Al \u2265 0.05, the specific surface areas of the La 2 O 3 -promoted aluminum samples decreased rapidly with the increase of the La/Al atomic ratio and the specific surface area of the samples with high La/Al atomic ratio started to be lower than that of the pure Al 2 O 3 sample. In our work, the La/Al atomic ratios of LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 and LaNi-Al 2 O 3 were 0.02 and 0.064, respectively. The above-mentioned theory explains why the specific surface area of LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 was higher than that of LaNi-Al 2 O 3 . The CaO-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts had a much lower BET specific surface area than that of the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The higher the CaO content was, the lower the surface area of the CaO-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts was. A similar effect of CaO on the specific surface area of Ni-Al 2 O 3 based catalysts was previously reported in the literature [50] . It was proposed that the reduced specific surface area observed in the case of the introduction Ca was due to the interaction between CaO and the Al 2 O 3 support, which may result in the formation of CaAl 4 O 7 [51] . The catalytic activity and coke resistivity of nickel-based catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane is also closely related to the interaction between nickel and the support [52] . The chemical interaction between nickel and the support and/or the promoters was characterized by H 2 -TPR. Fig. 2 shows the H 2 -TPR profiles of the various catalysts. The reduction peak temperature of free NiO during the H 2 -TPR process was reported to be around 330 \u00b0C [53] . With the increase of the chemical interaction between NiO and the support or promoters, a shift of the reduction peak to higher temperatures was expected. The reduction peak temperatures of the six catalysts were all higher than 800 \u00b0C, thereby suggesting that there was a strong interaction between nickel and the support (\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 ) or the promoters in the various catalysts synthesized by the glycine-nitrate combustion process. Such interaction could effectively suppress the grain growth of the NiO phase, which is beneficial for increasing the catalytic activity of the catalysts. A slight difference in peak temperatures was observed for the various catalysts with different promoters. The reduction peak temperatures of the three La 2 O 3 -promoted catalysts, i.e., LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LaNi-Al 2 O 3 and CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , were around 830 \u00b0C, which is slightly lower than that of Ni-Al 2 O 3 (851 \u00b0C). The reduction peak temperatures of the LiNi-Al 2 O 3 and CaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts were the highest at 870 and 883 \u00b0C, respectively. The relatively low reduction peak temperature of the La 2 O 3 -promoted catalysts can be explained by the formation of the LaNiO 2.5 perovskite-related oxide, which has a lower stability than the Ni 2 AlO 4 spinel [54] . The higher reduction temperatures of the CaNi-Al 2 O 3 and LiNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts as compared with the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst suggests that the introduction of Li or Ca promoters increases the interaction of Ni with the support and/or promoter. The increased reduction temperature of the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst by the addition of Li 2 O or CaO was previously reported by other researchers [55,56] . Hou et al. have demonstrated that an additional reduction peak around 400 \u00b0C appears for a CaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst at a high CaO concentration; this can be attributed to the reduction of free NiO particles within the catalyst [56] . In our study, no such peak appeared, thereby implying that the combustion synthesis resulted in a better and more homogeneous chemical interaction between NiO and the Al 2 O 3 support than that of the catalyst prepared by the conventional wetness co-impregnation method. 3.2 Catalytic performance Fig. 3 shows the methane conversion and CO selectivity over LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LiNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 and CaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane at the methane to oxygen/H 2 O/CO 2 ratio of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:1, respectively. All five catalysts showed a favorable catalytic activity for the above-mentioned three reactions at high temperatures (750\u2013850 \u00b0C). The decrease of the operation temperature led to different activities. Table 2 lists the detailed methane conversion over the five catalysts at 600 \u00b0C. It shows that the catalytic activity of the CaO-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts is a little lower than that of the Li 2 O-promoted and La 2 O 3 -promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. For example, the CH 4 conversion over the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst reached 85.6%, 80.3% and 80.0% for reactions 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while they were 82.1%, 69.8% and 73.4% over the CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The catalyst layer of SOFCs must also display high operation stability. Methane conversion over the various catalysts was first carried out under methane-rich conditions, i.e., at CH 4 :O 2 = 11.5:1, at 850 \u00b0C for a period of 100 h. The CO selectivity of 100% was achieved for all catalysts due to the high methane to oxygen ratio. Fig. 4 indicates the dependence of the methane conversion on the operation time for the various catalysts. After 100 h of operation, the decrease in methane conversion was of 4.5%, 4.6%, 5.8%, 6.7% and 7.6% for the LaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LiNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaNi-Al 2 O 3 and Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts, respectively. The Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst presented the worst catalytic stability. In general, the catalytic stability of the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts was improved by introducing the various promoters. However, the improvement was different for different compositions. During the first 20 h of operation, the performance of all six catalysts was relatively stable. However, during the next 80 h of operation, the decrease of the methane conversion varied for the different catalysts. The methane conversion over the CaNi-Al 2 O 3 and Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts decreased rapidly, while it was found to be stable over the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst during the whole operation period. The catalytic deactivation of \u03b3-A1 2 O 3 -supported catalysts during high-temperature operations is typically due to the thermal deterioration of the \u03b3-A1 2 O 3 support, i.e., the sintering and phase transformation into \u03b1-A1 2 O 3 that has a low surface area structure [57] . Rare earth metal oxides could prevent the alumina support from thermal deterioration [58] . The influence of alkali metals on the Lewis acid sites of \u03b3-A1 2 O 3 has been studied by NMR and IR of adsorbed CO by Castro and co-workers [59] . It was found that the alkali metals could not only introduce steric effects but also possible electronic modifications. The higher operation stability of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, as compared with the LiNi-Al 2 O 3 and LaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts, implies that La and Li oxides may have a synergistic effect on the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, which results in an excellent catalytic activity and operation stability of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. To further evaluate the operation stability of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst under more real fuel cell operation conditions, the catalyst was used for the partial oxidation of methane under slightly methane-rich conditions, i.e., CH 4 :O 2 = 2.2:1, at 850 \u00b0C for a period of 300 h. Fig. 5 shows the corresponding methane conversion and CO selectivity. The methane conversion was stable at \u223c95% and the CO selectivity was \u223c100% during the course of the 300 h of operation. The strong interaction between the NiO species and the Al 2 O 3 support, as evidenced by the H 2 -TPR results, largely contributed much to the excellent stability of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst by suppressing the sintering of the active nickel component. 3.3 Carbon deposition The anode catalyst layer must also display a high resistance to coke formation. The formation of carbon over the catalyst layer may destroy the integrity of the functional layer and therefore fail to protect the anode layer. Methane would then be directly in contact with the nickel cermet anode. Coke formation over the anode would thus most likely occur as nickel catalyses the methane cracking reaction. The deposited carbon can block the active sites of the anode, leading to a rapid deterioration of the fuel cell performance. To test the coke resistivity of the catalysts, the catalysts were subjected to a mixture of CH 4 and O 2 at a molar ratio of 11.5:1 for 100 h and O 2 -TPO analyses were performed. Fig. 6 shows the O 2 -TPO profiles of the catalysts. The order for the values of the CO 2 peak area of the different catalysts was: Ni-Al 2 O 3 > LiNi-Al 2 O 3 > LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 > CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 > LaNi-Al 2 O 3 > CaNi-Al 2 O 3 . The amount of carbon deposited was calculated found to be 1.56E-5, 1.33E-5, 1.06E-5, 7.64E-6, 5.81E-6 and 5.12E-6 for Ni-Al 2 O 3 , LiNi-Al 2 O 3 , LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , LaNi-Al 2 O 3 , and CaNi-Al 2 O 3 , respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of alkali metal and rare earth metal oxides to the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst increases the coking resistance of the catalyst. The CaO-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts had the best coking resistance among all the tested catalysts, while the Li 2 O-promoted Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts only slightly improved the coking resistance as compared with the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. It is well known that an acidic catalyst surface favors carbon deposition, while a basic one suppresses carbon deposition [60] . The improvement in coke resistance by introduction of CaO, Li 2 O or La 2 O 3 promoters is most likely due to the increase of the basicity of the catalyst. Under the methane-O 2 /H 2 O/CO 2 gas mixtures, the formation of coke and the elimination of coke happened simultaneously. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst depends on the difference between the coke formation rate and the coke elimination rate. To further exploit the coke resistance of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, in the catalyst was first subjected to pure methane at various temperatures at a flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 for 5 min. It was then protected with an inert gas at the flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 at room temperature. Fig. 7 presents the O 2 -TPO profiles of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst after treatment in pure methane at the temperature between 750 and 850 \u00b0C for 5 min. For comparison, the O 2 -TPO profile of the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst after the same treatment at 850 \u00b0C is also presented [32] . The amount of carbon deposited over the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst after the treatment in pure CH 4 gas for 5 min at 850 \u00b0C is only 18.5% as compared to that of Ni-Al 2 O 3 [32] . This is in good agreement with literature results showing that the introduction of La and Li oxides can greatly improve the coking resistance of Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalysts [42] . 3.4 Cell performance The LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was investigated as the anode functional layer in a real fuel cell. An anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cell with a ScSZ electrolyte, a LSM cathode and a LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 functional layer was prepared. Shown in Fig. 8 are the I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of the fuel cell operating on a methane-oxygen gas mixture, methane-steam gas mixture, and methane-CO 2 gas mixture. The methane to oxygen/H 2 O/CO 2 was 4:1, 2:1 and 2:1 at different temperatures. During the fuel cell operation, the methane and O 2 /CO 2 /H 2 O were reacted over the catalyst layer to form synthesis gas, which diffused into the anode layer to provide the fuel for the electrocatalytic oxidation over the triple phase boundaries. By applying the methane-oxygen gas mixture as the fuel, the cell delivered peak power densities of 538, 430, 378, 324 and 276 mW cm \u22122 at 850, 825, 800, 775 and 750 \u00b0C, respectively, while they were 547, 462, 390, 340 and 291 mW cm \u22122 when pure hydrogen was applied as the fuel. This indicates that the cell power outputs are similar by operating on methane-oxygen fuel and hydrogen fuel. It was reported that the cell delivered similar power outputs by operating on CO and H 2 gas mixtures and pure hydrogen because the CO can react with H 2 O to produce CO 2 and H 2 [61] . It implies that the methane was effectively converted to synthesis gas (CO + H 2 ) over the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer before it reached the anode layer. Otherwise, a much lower cell power output should be expected since methane has an activity that is much lower than that of H 2 . The cell delivered similar power outputs by operating on methane-steam or methane-CO 2 gas mixtures. These results indicate that the catalyst layer had a catalytic activity that was sufficient for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane. In our previous work, experiments on the stability of the cell performance with and without a Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer were carried out. When no Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was adopted, the PPD was reduced to about 41% of the initial value after operation on methane stream for 90 min. The decrease in PPD was of just about 3% when Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was adopted; it was still of only 4% after the operation on pure methane fuel for about 150 min [31] . The operation stability test was also carried out on the cell with the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer. As shown in Fig. 9 , by applying pure methane as the fuel, the open circuit voltage of the cell was stable during the course of the test, i.e., during 150 min, with a value of \u223c1.17 V. The initial PPD of the fuel cell was 437 mW cm \u22122 . After 150 min of operation, the PPD decreased to 421 mW cm \u22122 with a reduction of only about 3.7%. Shown in Fig. 9 b, the voltage is 0.694 V at the current density of 500 mA cm \u22122 at the beginning of the stability test, while the voltage decreased to 0.685 V with a reduction of only about 1.3% after 150 min of current polarization at 500 mA cm \u22122 . This good stability is a result of the good coking resistance of the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, as evidenced by the O 2 -TPO results. The SEM image of the fuel cell after the performance test between 750 and 850 \u00b0C under different fuel conditions for a period of 10 h is shown in Fig. 10 . The catalyst layer still adhered to the anode surface pretty well without any delimitation. In addition, no carbon could be observed on the catalyst layer and the anode layer. The above results indicate that the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst can be ideally used as the functional layer of SOFCs operating on methane fuel. 4 Conclusions The combustion-synthesized LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst had an excellent catalytic activity for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane between 600 and 850 \u00b0C. Its catalytic activity was comparable to those of LaNi-Al 2 O 3 and LiNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts but was higher than those of CaLaNi-Al 2 O 3 and CaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The strong interaction between NiO and the support accounted for the high activity of all five catalysts. Catalyst stability tests showed that the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst is superior to other catalysts under methane-rich conditions (CH 4 :O 2 = 11.5:1). This catalyst is quite stable under such high C/O ratios due to the synergistic effect of La and Li oxides. Furthermore, the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst keeps stable under the conditions of CH 4 :O 2 = 2.2:1 for 300 h at 850 \u00b0C. The excellent catalytic activity of this catalyst for the partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane resulted in a high cell performance when a fuel cell with a LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was operated on either methane-oxygen, methane-H 2 O or methane-CO 2 gas mixtures. The LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst also greatly reduces carbon deposition under pure methane conditions, as compared with the Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The cell with the LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was stable operated on pure methane at 850 \u00b0C for 150 min. The low cost of LiLaNi-Al 2 O 3 , its excellent catalytic activity and stability and its high coking resistance promise its application for use as the catalyst layer in SOFCs operating on methane.

        "abstract": "The feasibility of renewable acetic acid as a direct fuel of SOFCs for sustainable electric power generation was investigated. To solve the problem of carbon deposition over conventional nickel cermet anodes, an advanced catalyst for acetic acid catalytic decomposition/internal reforming reaction was exploited. A comparative study of coke formation over Ni/Al2O 3, Ni/MgO-Al2O3 and Ni-YSZ catalysts was conducted by oxygen-temperature programmed oxidation analysis. We found that the Ni/MgO-Al2O3 catalyst is much superior to the other two catalysts in suppressing carbon deposition, especially under the condition of the presence of steam in the acetic acid fuel. Various cells were fabricated and tested under different conditions. The differences in OCVs and power outputs of the cells caused by the usage of hydrogen and acetic acid as fuels were studied and explained based on the thermodynamic calculation and EIS measurement. After optimization, a peak power density of 1325 mW cm-2 at a furnace temperature of 800\u00b0C was achieved for the cell with a catalyst layer operating on acetic acid fuel. The cell was successfully operated continuously on acetic acid-steam fuel for a period of at least 200 h without any noticeable performance degradation, delamination of the catalyst layer and carbon deposition. The promising results of this work show the possibility of better utilization of the abundant bio-mass or bio-oil for future energy generation.

        "title": "Solid-oxide fuel cell operated on in situ catalytic decomposition products of liquid hydrazine",
        "abstract": "Hydrazine was examined as a fuel for a solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that employed a typical nickel-based anode. An in situ catalytic decomposition of hydrazine at liquid state under room temperature and ambient pressure before introducing to the fuel cell was developed by applying a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) oxide catalyst. Catalytic testing demonstrated that liquid N 2 H 4 can be decomposed to gaseous NH 3 and H 2 at a favorable rate and at a temperature as low as 20 \u00b0C and H 2 selectivity reaching values as high as 10% at 60 \u00b0C. Comparable fuel cell performance was observed using either the in situ decomposition products of hydrazine or pure hydrogen as fuel. A peak power density of \u223c850 mW cm \u22122 at 900 \u00b0C was obtained with a typical fuel cell composed of scandia-stabilized zirconia and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode. The high energy and power density, easy storage and simplicity in fuel delivery make it highly attractive for portable applications. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cell Hydrazine Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Nickel Portable application 1 Introduction A fuel cell is an electrochemical energy conversion device that is known for its high energy efficiency and low environmental impact. Its high energy density and quick \u201crecharging\u201d (refueling) capability in connection with the increased power requirements of portable devices have resulted in considerable interest in fuel cells for use in portable and micropower applications. A solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an all-solid high-temperature fuel cell that applies a conducting (oxygen ion or proton) oxide as the electrolyte [1,2] . Traditionally, SOFCs were not seriously considered for mobile applications. However, recent advances in micro-tubular and single-chamber SOFCs have changed this situation [3\u201310] . The significant advantages of SOFCs over polymer\u2013electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for portable applications arise from its versatile fuel selection coupled with higher power density. Hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, alcohols and ammonia are all potential fuels for SOFCs [11\u201313] . As the ideal fuel for portable fuel cell, it should meet several requirements: high energy density, easy storage, good availability and favorable electrochemical activity. Liquid fuels are preferred over compressed hydrogen due to the fact that they have much higher energy density per volume. On the other hand, state-of-the-art fuel cell materials are the most attractive components for portable SOFCs since their properties are well established. Stabilized zirconia\u2013Ni and doped ceria\u2013Ni cermets are the typical anodes for SOFCs. The nickel functions as the conduction path for electrons and also the catalyst for the electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen. Liquid hydrocarbons have recently attracted considerable attention as potential fuels for SOFCs due to their high energy density and good availability [14\u201317] . However, with the liquid hydrocarbons serious carbon coking was observed over the nickel anode [17] . Although considerable advances have been made with both CeO 2 \u2013Cu and perovskite anodes [18\u201321] , the relatively low power density and the difficulty in fuel cell fabrication with the use of those materials have introduced new problems. Hydrazine, or diamine, in the form of propellant for thrusters, is by far the most common means of spacecraft propulsion and attitude control. And it is used as a monopropellant for satellite station-keeping motors because hydrazine will decompose (ignite) when placed in contact with platinum group metal catalysts. Hydrazine monopropellant systems have also been used as auxiliary power units on aircraft. In this paper, liquid hydrazine was applied as the fuel for the SOFC. Hydrazine fuel cells were investigated extensively in the 1960\u20131970s, as an alkaline fuel cell (AFC) that utilized a liquid alkaline electrolyte [22\u201324] . Recently, the possible application of hydrazine as the fuel for a fuel cell based on a polymer\u2013electrolyte membrane was also reported [25\u201327] . However, the application of hydrazine as fuel for SOFCs is rarely reported in literature. Here an in situ decomposition of liquid hydrazine to gaseous NH 3 and H 2 at room temperature and ambient pressure by applying an innovative oxide catalyst before introducing it into the fuel cell reactor was proposed. When compared to using hydrogen as a fuel based on a typical nickel-based anode-supported SOFC, comparable performance was obtained. The in situ decomposition of liquid hydrazine to form gaseous products does not require a fuel pump or a high-pressure gas tank and valves, which greatly simplifies the fuel cell system. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) oxide was used as the catalyst for the liquid state hydrazine decomposition at room temperature. BSCF powders were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [28] . Stoichiometric amounts of Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 , and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 were dissolved in water, followed by the addition of EDTA\u2013NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O and citric acid in sequence at the mole ratio of EDTA:citric acid:metal ions = 1:2:1. NH 3 \u00b7H 2 O was applied during the evaporation of the water in order to sustain a pH value of around 6 for the solution. A gel was finally obtained, which was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C for 2 h and further calcined at 800\u20131000 \u00b0C for 5 h to result in the final product with the desired composition. 2.2 Fuel cell fabrication An anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cell with NiO + Sc 0.1 Zr 0.9 O 1.9 (scandia-doped zirconia, ScSZ) anode, ScSZ electrolyte, and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathode were applied in this study. Commercial NiO (Shanghai Hengxin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.) was applied for the nickel source. ScSZ and LSM were synthesized by the EDTA\u2013citrate combined complexing process similar to the preparation of BSCF. The anode materials were prepared by mixing NiO and ScSZ powders in the ratio of 60:40 (wt.%) using a high-energy ball miller (FRITSCH, Pulverisette 6). A bi-layer of ScSZ electrolyte and anode support was co-pressed into disks of 15 mm in diameter and then co-fired at 1500 \u00b0C in air for 5 h. The subsequent layer of LSM with an effective area of 0.48 cm 2 was spray deposited onto the surface of the electrolyte and then sintered at 1150 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. 2.3 Hydrazine catalytic decomposition test The catalytic activity of BSCF for the hydrazine decomposition was tested between 20 and 65 \u00b0C using a flat bottom flask, as shown in Fig. 1 . 0.5 g of the BSCF catalyst was dropped into 30 mL of N 2 H 4 liquid in a 250 mL flat bottom flask, which was stirred strongly with a magnetic stirrer and heated with a water bath to ensure a homogeneous temperature distribution of the hydrazine during the exothermal hydrazine decomposition. Gaseous products were first introduced to a H 3 PO 4 trap to get rid of N 2 H 4 vapor and NH 3 . The formation rate of N 2 + H 2 was then measured by the volumetric method. The ratio of N 2 and H 2 in the effluent gas was also in situ measured by GC (Varian 3800) equipped with a 5 \u00c5 molecule sieve column for composition analysis. 2.4 Fuel cell test The fuel cell test was performed in a self-constructed SOFC test station. Silver paste was applied as the current collector for both the cathode and anode. The cell was sealed onto a quartz tube with the cathode side open to ambient air. Hydrogen at the flow rate of 80 mL min \u22121 [STP] with the help of mass flow controller, or the in situ decomposed product of hydrazine, was introduced to the anode as the fuel. A Keithley 2420 source meter was used for the I \u2013 V polarization test. Four-terminal configuration was employed. 2.5 Other characterization The phase composition of BSCF and other fuel cell components were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning at the range of 20\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 80\u00b0. The specific surface area of the BSCF catalyst was characterized by N 2 adsorption using a BELSORP II instrument at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The morphological properties of the fuel cell were examined by environmental scanning microscopy (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The electrode performance was investigated by the ac impedance method using an electrochemical workstation based on Solartron 1287 potentiostat and a 1260 A frequency response analyzer. The applied frequency ranged from 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz with signal amplitude of 10 mV under open cell voltage (OCV) conditions. 3 Results and discussion BSCF is a mixed oxygen ionic and electronic conductor, which has been widely applied as the ceramic membrane for separation of oxygen from air and more recently as the cathode for intermediate-temperature SOFCs with high performance [29,30] . Mixed conducting oxides have also been found to be excellent catalysts for the decomposition of H 2 O 2 to H 2 O and O 2 in liquid state [31] . Since N 2 H 4 has a similar molecular structure to H 2 O 2 , the catalytic activity of BSCF for N 2 H 4 decomposition was investigated. Blank runs demonstrated that no thermal decomposition of hydrazine occurred at a temperature lower than 100 \u00b0C. This suggests that hydrazine by itself is stable enough as a fuel. Zheng et al. also observed that hydrazine decomposed only slightly at a temperature lower than 170 \u00b0C and 100% conversion was reached only at temperature higher than \u223c250 \u00b0C [32] . After the calcination in air at 1000 \u00b0C, the typical cubic perovskite structure was observed for BSCF, suggesting the formation of the desired phase structure. BET surface area of the oxide was found to be only 0.48 m 2 g \u22121 . Such low surface area is due to the high surface activity of BSCF [30] and the high calcination temperature (1000 \u00b0C). After dropping the catalyst into the liquid hydrazine, gaseous products immediately evolved from the catalyst surface, demonstrating the high activity of BSCF towards the hydrazine decomposition. The formation rate of the gaseous products was found to increase quickly with higher operation temperatures. At temperatures higher than 65 \u00b0C, too much heat produced during the hydrazine decomposition led to the out of control of temperature. With the molecular structure of N 2 H 4 , there are two types of bonds available, N\u2013N and N\u2013H. Therefore, the catalytic decomposition can proceed in two different ways: (1) N 2 H 4 \u2192 N 2 + 2H 2 (\u0394 H = \u221295.4 kJ mol \u22121 ) (2) 3N 2 H 4 \u2192 N 2 + 4NH 3 (\u0394 H = \u2212157.4 kJ mol \u22121 ) The overall decomposition can be expressed as follows: (3) 3N 2 H 4 \u2192 4(1 \u2212 x )NH 3 + (1 + 2 x )N 2 + (6 x )H 2 The H 2 selectivity (towards the reaction (1) ), x can be calculated by (4) x = 1 / 2 [ H 2 ] 1 / 2 [ H 2 ] + 3 / 4 [ N H 3 ] = 2 [ H 2 ] 2 [ H 2 ] + 3 [ N H 3 ] The measured temperature dependence of H 2 and NH 3 selectivity is shown in Fig. 2 . It indicates that the catalytic decomposition of N 2 H 4 over the BSCF catalyst favored both the cracking of N\u2013N and N\u2013H bonds, but with the main reaction more towards the N\u2013N cracking to form NH 3 and N 2 . The H 2 selectivity was found to increase monotonically with the increase in operating temperature at the investigated range of 20\u201365 \u00b0C. The reaction at temperatures higher than 65 \u00b0C was too fast; therefore no further investigation was conducted. The hydrogen selectivity reached \u223c10% at 60 \u00b0C with the BSCF catalyst. In the molecular structure of N 2 H 4 , the bonding energy for N\u2013N and N\u2013H is 60 kJ mol \u22121 and 84 kJ mol \u22121 , respectively. This suggests that the N\u2013H bond in N 2 H 4 thermodynamically is more stable than the N\u2013N bond. In other words, the decomposition thermodynamically prefers the N\u2013N cracking to form NH 3 and N 2 . Indeed, it was reported that below 300 \u00b0C, the reaction was 100% towards the formation of N 2 and NH 3 over typical Ir/Al 2 O 3 catalyst [33] . The formation of hydrogen suggests that the BSCF catalyst also favored the cracking of the N\u2013H bond. It is surmised that the N\u2013H bond in the N 2 H 4 structure was likely activated by the formation of the hydrogen\u2013oxygen bond via its hydrogen interacting with the surface oxygen ions in the BSCF perovskite. The formation of the O\u2013H bond weakened the bonding strength for the N\u2013H in N 2 H 4 and made the cracking of the N\u2013H bond favorable. An investigation of the activation mechanism of perovskite for the N 2 H 4 decomposition is definitely required and will be conducted in the future. In the test of the hydrazine decomposition rate, gas evolved from the flask was then introduced to a H 3 PO 4 trap for the absorption of the NH 3 gas and the minor amount of N 2 H 4 vapor in the gaseous products. The purified gas was then connected with a volumetric meter for measuring the formation rate of N 2 + H 2 . Based on the results from volumetric experiments together with the selectivity of H 2 and NH 3 as detected by GC ( Fig. 2 ), the N 2 H 4 decomposition rate and the formation rates of H 2 , NH 3 and N 2 were then calculated. As shown in Fig. 3 , favorable N 2 H 4 decomposition and H 2 /NH 3 production rates were observed. The electrical power generated from the in situ created H 2 /NH 3 fuels per gram of catalyst at various temperatures was then calculated ( Fig. 4 ). It was found that 1 g of BSCF catalyst was able to produce enough H 2 /NH 3 fuel for a 15 W fuel cell at the operation temperature of 30 \u00b0C or a \u223c30 W SOFC at 65 \u00b0C, assuming 50% fuel efficiency. Since BSCF had very low surface area (0.48 m 2 g \u22121 ) the improvement of the surface area of the catalyst by advanced synthesis technique could result in substantially increasing the catalytic activity. The BSCF catalyst operated stably for more than 10 h without failure. With the further modification of the catalyst via the strategy of doping, the catalyst could be in operation for hundreds of hours without degradation. 3.1 Fuel cell test To test the fuel cell performance with the current in situ created gaseous H 2 /NH 3 as fuels, an anode-supported thin-film electrolyte fuel cell based on ScSZ electrolyte was built with the configuration of NiO + ScSZ|ScSZ|LSM. Fig. 5 shows the typical microstructure of the single cell. As can be seen, the fuel cell had an electrolyte thickness of \u223c30 \u03bcm, cathode thickness of 35 \u03bcm, and anode thickness of \u223c1 mm. Porosity test demonstrated that the anode had a porosity of \u223c22 vol.% after reduction and the cathode of \u223c30 vol.%. Both the anode and cathode adhered to the electrolyte surfaces relatively well. For comparison, the fuel cell was first tested using pure hydrogen as the fuel. The corresponding I \u2013 V and P \u2013 I curves for the fuel cells are shown in Fig. 6 a . An OCV of 1.12 V was reached at 900 \u00b0C. With the decrease of the operation temperature, the OCV increased steadily to 1.16 V at 650 \u00b0C. The OCVs were near the theoretical values, suggesting that no obvious gas leakage through the electrolyte membrane or sealing took place, which agrees well with no penetrated pin-holes observed in the electrolyte layer by SEM ( Fig. 5 ). The power density decreased steadily with the decrease of operation temperature from \u223c1 W cm \u22122 at 900 \u00b0C, 412 mW cm \u22122 at 800 \u00b0C, to 67 mW cm \u22122 at 650 \u00b0C. The trend of decreased performance with the lowering of the operation temperature was attributed to the decrease of the cathode performance and the increase of the ohmic polarization from the electrolyte. After the test with hydrogen fuel, the in situ created H 2 and NH 3 from the catalytic decomposition of liquid-state N 2 H 4 at 40 \u00b0C with 0.1 g catalyst were directed to the fuel cell as the fuels. Very good performance was also observed as shown in Fig. 6 b. For example, a peak power density of 850 mW cm \u22122 and an OCV of 1.02 V were achieved at 900 \u00b0C, which is only slightly lower than that with hydrogen as the fuel. With decreasing operation temperature, the difference in peak power density between hydrogen fuel and in situ created H 2 /NH 3 fuels became even smaller. A peak power density of 380 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at 800 \u00b0C with the fuels from the in situ catalytic decomposition of N 2 H 4 at liquid state as compared to a value of 412 mW cm \u22122 with hydrogen as fuel. At the operation temperature of 650 \u00b0C, the performance is almost the same (71 mW cm \u22122 versus 67 mW cm \u22122 ). Fig. 7 shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the fuel cell under open circuit voltages using H 2 and the in situ created NH 3 and H 2 as fuel(s) at various temperatures, respectively. For both cases, it was found that the fuel cell polarization resistance was mainly contributed from the electrodes, especially at reduced temperatures. Such electrode polarization was mainly attributed to the poor activity of LSM cathode for oxygen reduction at reduced temperature. The development of innovative high performance cathode would expect a sharp increase in the fuel cell performance. The similar electrode polarization resistances with H 2 and in situ N 2 H 4 decomposition product as fuel suggests that the similar anode overpotential, agreed well with the I \u2013 V polarization test. Since the actual fuel for the SOFC in current hydrazine-fueled fuel cells is ammonia and small amounts of hydrogen, the direct electrochemical oxidation of NH 3 to N 2 and H 2 O should demonstrate an increase in OCV with increase of temperature due to the positive absolute value of \u0394 G \u00b0 for the following reaction: (5) 4NH 3 (g) + 6O 2\u2212 \u2192 6H 2 O(g) + 2N 2 (g) + 12e \u2212 (6) O 2 + 4e \u2212 \u2192 2O 2\u2212 (7) 4NH 3 (g) + 6O 2 \u2192 6H 2 O(g) + 2N 2 (g) However, a decrease of OCVs with the increase of the operation temperature for the SOFC was observed operated on the in situ created H 2 /NH 3 , as shown in Fig. 6 b, just as the same for hydrogen fuel. This suggests that the oxidation of NH 3 in current fuel cell systems is likely to proceed via the indirect way. First NH 3 was decomposed to N 2 and H 2 under the catalysts of the nickel anode: (8) 2NH 3 \u2192 N 2 + 3H 2 Then H 2 was electrocatalytically oxidized to water and the simultaneous production of electricity: (9) H 2 + O 2\u2212 \u2192 H 2 O + 2e \u2212 Similar observations were noted by Meng and coworkers with ammonia as the fuel [34] . The typical anode material in SOFCs, nickel, is an excellent catalyst for ammonia decomposition. It was believed that ammonia could completely decompose over nickel anodes at temperatures as low as 600 \u00b0C [35] . Therefore, under current operation conditions, the direct fuel for the electrocatalytic oxidation over the anode is actually hydrogen instead of ammonia. It then well explained the similar performance of fuel cells with hydrogen fuel and the in situ created H 2 /NH 3 fuel. The relatively lower OCVs for the fuel cell when operated on H 2 /NH 3 than on H 2 is attributed to the dilution effect of nitrogen. Stable performance was observed during tens of hours\u2019 test. No morphologic change of the fuel cell was observed after the test using in situ created NH 3 and H 2 as the fuels. Recently, it has been demonstrated that ammonia is an excellent fuel for SOFC [34,36\u201339] . The hydrazine could be treated as a liquid storage material for ammonia. It was reported that the reduction process of NiO in ammonia was too slow below 750 \u00b0C [34] . The availability of H 2 in the evolved gases from the catalytic decomposition of N 2 H 4 over BSCF catalyst is then beneficial for operation at reduced temperatures, which allows the fuel cell anode no necessary to be pre-reduced even at a temperature lower than 600 \u00b0C. Up until now, typically two types of liquid fuels were available for portable fuel cell application, i.e. , the fuel in liquid phase at room temperature and ambient pressure (such as ethanol), and pressurized liquid fuels such as NH 3 and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Fuel pumps and vaporization systems are needed to introduce the non-pressurized liquid fuel into the fuel cell reactor, while a high-pressure tank and gas value are needed for the storing and delivering of the pressurized liquid fuel. For both cases, the auxiliary components increase the complexity of the fuel cell system, which decreases the portability of the fuel cells. With the current in situ catalytic decomposition of liquid N 2 H 4 to H 2 and NH 3 , no gas valve, pressured tank or vaporization system is needed. Therefore the fuel cell system can be greatly simplified and constructed to be more compact. In addition, hydrazine has excellent handling characteristics, relatively high stability under normal conditions, clean decomposition products and high energy density. Its hydrogen percentage reaches as high as 12.5 wt.%, which is higher than all the available metal hydrides, in addition to other chemical hydrogen storage materials such as NaBH 4 . It also has an excellent volumetric energy density of 63 mol H 2 /L, which is higher than the liquid NH 3 value of 53 mol H 2 /L, and methanol with a value of 49 mol H 2 /L. N 2 H 4 is in liquid state between a wide temperature range of 2.0\u2013113.5 \u00b0C. It is miscible with water, methyl isobutyl alcohol. By forming the mixed solution, the temperature window of the liquid phase can be further widened. For example, when N 2 H 4 combines with water to form hydrazine hydrate (N 2 H 4 \u00b7H 2 O), its melting point decreases to \u221251.5 \u00b0C and its boiling point increases to 120.1 \u00b0C. Although N 2 H 4 is naturally toxic, it has a low vapor pressure of only 14.4 Torr at 25 \u00b0C, and therefore it is easy to be stored safely. More importantly, the complete decomposition products (N 2 and H 2 ), and the complete oxidation products (N 2 and H 2 O) are not harmful. The in situ decomposition of N 2 H 4 as fuel suggests that the actual fuels that were introduced into the fuel cell were N 2 , H 2 and NH 3 . Although it might be a minor amount of N 2 H 4 present in the decomposed gas, N 2 H 4 would be 100% thermally decomposed at a temperature higher than 250 \u00b0C, which further reduces the risk of exposing N 2 H 4 to the environment. All of the above features make N 2 H 4 the ideal fuel for portable SOFC applications. 4 Conclusions Hydrazine was applied as the fuel for a SOFC with a typical nickel based anode. Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide was found to be an active catalyst for the decomposition of N 2 H 4 at liquid state to gaseous NH 3 and H 2 at room temperature and ambient pressure. Hydrogen selectivity as high as 10% was reached, suggesting that BSCF favored both the cracking of N\u2013H and N\u2013N bonds in N 2 H 4 . The in situ created products were found to be highly promising fuel for the SOFC and delivered a performance similar to using a hydrogen fuel. The combined advantages of the high energy density of N 2 H 4 with the freedom from pressurized gas tanks and valves make N 2 H 4 highly attractive for portable SOFC applications.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrated there was no noticeable phase reaction between infiltrated La 2NiO4 and LSGM (or SDC) scaffold, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that the La2NiO4 phase formed as nanoparticles that decorated the surface of the scaffold. Different from conventional symmetric SOFCs, the electrode material La2NiO 4 of current cells was reduced under an anode atmosphere to form metallic nickel as a high active catalyst for fuel oxidation. After the reduction, the electrode morphology and geometric integrity were maintained for the infiltrated electrode. For thick electrolyte-supported symmetric SOFCs with infiltrated La2NiO4 electrodes, an attractive maximum power density of \ufffd\ufffd550 mW cm-2 was achieved at 800 C operating on hydrogen fuel, significantly higher than similar cells with stable perovskite oxide electrodes, as reported in the literature. It suggested that the unreduced and reduced La2NiO4 performed well as a cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction and as an anode for fuel electro-oxidation, respectively. In addition, a favorable operating stability was demonstrated for a symmetric SOFC with an infiltrated La2NiO4 electrode.

        "abstract": "Initialization is a critical processing step that has thus far limited the application of the single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC). In-situ initialization of a SC-SOFC with a nickel-based anode by methane\u2013air mixtures was investigated. Porous Ru\u2013CeO 2 was used as a catalyst layer over a Ni-ScSZ cermet anode. Catalytic testing demonstrated Ru\u2013CeO 2 had high activity for methane oxidation. The Ru in the catalyst layer catalyzed the formation of syngas, which successfully reduced the nickel oxide to metallic nickel in the anode. Single cells with a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) cathode, initialized by this in-situ reduction method, delivered peak power densities of 205 and 327 mW cm \u22122 at 800 \u00b0C and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Such performances were better than those of the cell without the Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst layer that was initialized by an ex-situ reduction method were. Keywords Single-chamber Solid oxide fuel cells Ru\u2013CeO 2 Methane Initialization 1 Introduction Fuel cells are a type of green electrical power generator with high energy conversion efficiency and size flexibility. In a typical single cell, sealant is usually applied to divide the fuel cell into an anode chamber and a cathode chamber for introducing fuel and oxidant (air) separately. The single-chamber solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) is a new, simple energy conversion device with its anode and cathode exposed to the same fuel\u2013air mixture of gases in one chamber [1] . The sealing-free feature allows for quick start-up and shut down. As a result, there has recently been much interest in the SC-SOFC as a micro-power generator [2] . The operating principle of the SC-SOFC involves the different catalytic selectivity and activity of the electrodes towards the fuel\u2013air mixture. Ideally, the cathode is active and selective only for oxygen reductions, and the anode for partial oxidation of fuel to syngas (CO + H 2 ) and electrocatalytic oxidation of syngas. Methane and propane are the most applied fuels in SC-SOFCs, and traditional nickel\u2013cermet anodes are promising catalysts for their partial oxidation. During the past several years, very impressive power densities \u2013 comparable to those of the dual-chamber SOFCs \u2013 have been reported for SC-SOFCs [3\u20136] . Up to now, research activities on SC-SOFCs have mainly focused on improving the cell performance and the micro-fabrication, while the critical initialization process is overlooked [7\u201313] . The nickel is typically in an oxidized state within the anode of cells fabricated by traditional methods. In a dual-chamber configuration, the activation process is simple because the hydrogen fuel can reduce the anode in-situ without having an effect on the cathode since they are independent of each other. Fuel cell initialization (activation) here refers to the reduction of NiO to metallic nickel, which is the active component for fuel partial oxidation and also electrocatalytic oxidation of syngas. In an SC-SOFC, the in-situ reduction of the anode by hydrogen may also cause the reduction of the cathode and lead to the failure or performance deterioration of the fuel cell [14\u201315] . Therefore, a complicated ex-situ reduction process has been adopted, i.e., the anode-electrolyte bi-layer cells are first reduced by hydrogen and then the cathode-deposited cells are sintered under an inert atmosphere to avoid the re-oxidation of the metallic nickel in the anode. Although a cathode with high chemical stability allows activation of the cells by in-situ hydrogen reduction, the use of hydrogen inevitably increases the complexity of the SC-SOFC system and makes it less portable [15] . The ideal way to activate an SC-SOFC is via in-situ reduction by an air\u2013fuel mixture. Unfortunately, this method fails when adopted for a normal nickel-based anode [14] . In this communication, we report successful initialization of an SC-SOFC by methane\u2013air mixtures of gases and improved cell performance, simply by applying a Ru\u2013CeO 2 functional layer over the traditional NiO\u2013(Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) anode. 2 Experimental The fuel cells employed in this study were in an anode-supported configuration with a NiO + ScSZ anode substrate (\u223c500 \u03bcm, NiO:ScSZ = 60:40 by weight), ScSZ electrolyte (\u223c30 \u03bcm) and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode (LSM, \u223c20 \u03bcm). Both ScSZ and LSM were synthesized by a combined EDTA-citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [16] , while the 10 wt% RuO 2 \u2013CeO 2 catalyst was synthesized by a glycine\u2013nitrite process [17] . The catalyst layer was fabricated onto the anode surface by spray deposition and sintering at 850 \u00b0C for 2 h. The activity of the catalyst for methane partial oxidation was evaluated in a flow-through fixed-bed reactor. About 0.1 g of catalyst particles in the size of 60\u201380 mesh was dropped into the middle of the reactor. A gas mixture of He\u2013CH 4 \u2013O 2 was introduced from the top of the reactor and the effluent gases from the bottom of the reactor were introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph for compositional analysis. The fuel cell initiation was performed with a methane\u2013air mixture at a methane-to-oxygen ratio of 2:1 (CH 4 :130 ml min \u22121 , air:325 ml min \u22121 [Standard Temperature and Pressure, STP]), while the fuel cell performance test was conducted at a methane-to-oxygen ratio of 1.3:1 (CH 4 :110 ml min \u22121 , air:425 ml min \u22121 [STP]). I\u2013V polarization curves were collected using a Keithley 2420 source meter based on the four-terminal configuration. The cell performance was also investigated by the AC impedance method, using an electrochemical workstation based on a Solartron 1287 potentiostat and a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer. 3 Results and discussion The cell voltage was directly related to the oxygen potential difference over the anode and cathode. Since the SC-SOFC electrodes were exposed to the same fuel\u2013air mixture of gases, a zero open circuit voltage (OCV) was expected if no reaction happened over either electrode. Fig. 1 shows the response of the cell voltage to time-on-stream for the cells with and without the Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst layer, at a furnace temperature of 800 \u00b0C and flowing with a methane\u2013air mixture with a CH 4 to O 2 ratio of 2:1. The cathode\u2019s oxygen potential was considered similar to the surrounding atmosphere, while the anode\u2019s oxygen potential was strongly dependent on the catalytic activity of the anode towards the methane\u2013air mixture. The successful reduction of NiO to metallic nickel in the anode would induce the partial oxidation of methane to syngas and lead to a sharp decrease in the oxygen potential over the anode surface and consequently, an increase in the cell voltage would be expected. The cell voltage was almost unchanged at \u223c0.0 V for the cell without the catalyst layer within the 67 min period under investigation, indicating the failure in cell initialization. For the cell with the catalyst layer, an initial cell voltage of 0.08 V was observed. This suggests the Ru\u2013CeO 2 layer had catalytic activity for methane oxidation even at the very beginning. The cell voltage increased progressively with time-on-stream and reached around 1.0 V after 50 min on-stream. The CH 4 to O 2 was then changed to 1.3:1 and the cell voltage correspondingly dropped to a stable voltage of around 0.9 V. These results strongly suggest the successful initialization of the cell. The failure of the methane\u2013air mixture to activate the cell without the catalyst layer was attributed to the poor catalytic activity of NiO for methane conversion and the high chemical stability of NiO [14] . Fig. 2 shows the CH 4 /O 2 conversions and CO/CO 2 selectivity for both the blank run and under catalysis by Ru\u2013CeO 2 . For analysis purposes, the nitrogen was replaced by equal amount of helium in this experiment. It was observed that the Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst started to demonstrate high activity for methane conversion and consumed the total amount of oxygen present at a temperature as low as 450 \u00b0C. With further increases in the operation temperature, the CO selectivity increased considerably. The successful initialization of the cell with the catalyst layer can then be explained by the high activity of RuO 2 and metallic Ru for methane oxidation. The ruthenium in the fresh Ru + CeO 2 catalyst layer took the oxidation state and exhibited high activity for methane deep oxidation (CH 4 + O 2 \u2192 CO 2 + H 2 O). During catalysis on RuO 2 , the oxygen near the surface was consumed resulting in the decrease of the oxygen partial pressure over the anode surface at the very beginning of the initialization process. The low oxygen potential over the RuO 2 \u2013CeO 2 surface then induced the reduction of RuO 2 to metallic Ru, which is a highly efficient catalyst for partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas [18] . The syngas formed catalytically with metallic Ru, then diffused into the nickel-ScSZ anode layer, resulting in the progressive reduction of NiO to nickel. Finally, the whole anode was successfully activated. The above results also indicate that the activated process of the cell is influenced by the presence of Ru + CeO 2 layer in the anode during the cell testing. Fig. 3 shows the I\u2013V and I\u2013P curves of an in-situ activated cell operating on methane\u2013air mixtures (CH 4 to O 2 ratio of 1.3:1) at various temperatures. An impressive peak power density of 327 mW cm \u22122 was achieved at a furnace temperature of 850 \u00b0C. Table 1 lists the peak power density, shorted current density and electrode resistance at selected temperatures for the cells initialized by three different methods, including: cell 1, without the catalyst layer, initialized by ex-situ reduction [15] ; cell 2, without the catalyst layer, initialized by in-situ H 2 reduction [15] ; and cell 3, with catalyst layer, initialized by the in-situ methane\u2013air mixture. Fig. 3 clearly shows that cell 3 had the highest power density, the largest shorted current density and the lowest electrode polarization resistance. As demonstrated previously, the poor performance of cell 2 was due to the damaged to the cathodic microstructure caused by the reduction\u2013re-oxidation process [15] . For cells 1 and 3, their cathode performance can be reasonably considered the same, and so the differences in cell performance come mainly from the anode. It is well known that H 2 and CO have higher electrochemical activity than methane fuel, while Ru\u2013CeO 2 has much better catalytic activity for methane partial oxidation to syngas than the Ni-ScSZ anode. This fact suggests that the CO and H 2 concentration around the anode of cell 3 was higher than that of cell 1. In addition, the partial oxidation of methane is an exothermic reaction, so the temperatures of cells 1 and 3 are different with each other. In our experiment, the temperatures of the cell 3 rose by at least 85 \u00b0C to 94 \u00b0C for furnace operating temperatures between 750 \u00b0C and 850 \u00b0C. As a comparison, the values of the elevated temperatures of the cell 1 were only 25 \u00b0C to 44 \u00b0C within the same temperature range. The higher temperatures have some advantages in reducing the cathodic polarization resistance, and increasing the electrolyte conductivity and the anodic catalytic activity. Consequently, the above results lead to a better cell performance. 4 Conclusions Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst possessed very high activity for the partial oxidation of methane between 450 \u00b0C and 850 \u00b0C. Syngas produced over a Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst layer facilitated the reduction of NiO to metallic Ni in the anode and resulted in the successful activation of the cell. Since methane\u2013air mixtures are the operating atmospheres of SC-SOFCs, using them for in-situ activation is highly convenient, as compared to initialization by ex-situ reduction. They also avoid the risk of cathode reduction that happens with in-situ reduction with hydrogen. The excellent catalytic activity of the catalyst layer also resulted in a high concentration of syngas over the anode surface, and consequently, a better cell performance than those initialized by the other methods. The much simpler in-situ reduction method and better cell performance make the inclusion of a catalyst layer a very promising advance in methane-fueled SC-SOFCs.

        "abstract": "The influence of iron doping level in Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 ( y = 0.0\u20131.0) (BSCF) oxides on their phase structure, oxygen nonstoichiometry, electrical conductivity, performance as symmetrical cell electrode and oxygen permeating membranes was systematically investigated. A cubic perovskite structure was observed for all the compositions with the presence of iron. The increase of iron doping level resulted in the decrease of the lattice constant, room-temperature oxygen nonstoichiometry, total electrical conductivity, and the increase of area specific resistance (ASR) as cathode with samaria doped ceria electrolyte. However, promising cathode performance with an ASR as low as 0.613 \u03a9 cm 2 was still obtained at 600 \u00b0C for Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 FeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSF). The ceramic membranes composing of BSCF with various iron doping level are all oxygen semi-permeable at elevated temperatures. The increase of iron doping level resulted in the decrease of oxygen permeation flux from J O 2 = 2.28 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 s \u22121 (STP) for Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF5582) to \u223c0.45 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 s \u22121 (STP) at 900 \u00b0C for BSF ( y = 1.0) with the same membrane thickness of 1.1 mm, alongside with the change of the rate-determination step from the oxygen surface exchange to the slow oxygen bulk diffusion. The formation of composite oxide with a proper electronic conducting phase and the thin film technology are important for their prospective application as cathode in IT-SOFCs and oxygen permeating membrane, respectively. Keywords BSCF Mixed conducting Ceramic membrane Cathode SOFCs 1 Introduction Mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) composite oxides are of increasing interest as ceramic membranes for oxygen production from air and electrode materials of reduced temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for power generation [1\u201310] . The ceramic membranes based on mixed conducting oxides allow oxygen to permeate through with infinite oxygen selectivity under the drive of oxygen partial pressure difference across the membrane. Substantial reduction in capital cost of oxygen production for both plant construction and operation is envisaged by this novel membrane process as compared to traditional techniques such as the distillation of cryogenic air. On the other hand, the cathodes based on mixed conducting oxide can effectively extend the oxygen reduction site from the typical electrode\u2013electrolyte-gas triple phase boundary to the entire exposed cathode surface, thus greatly reducing the cathode polarization at lower operation temperatures. The reduced operation temperature of SOFCs has several benefits such as increased operation life time and reduced fabrication/raw material cost. One group of perovskite materials, such as LaFeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (1273 K, 10 \u221212 Pa) [7] , LaGa 0.65 Mg 0.15 Ni 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (1223 K, 9.5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 Pa) [8] , SrFe 0.7 Al 0.3 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (1100 K, 10 \u221214 Pa) [9] and Sr 0.7 Ce 0.3 MnO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (1223 K, 2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 Pa) [10] , have been extensively investigated due to their high oxygen ionic and electronic conductivities at elevated temperatures as well as their structural stability in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, where the quantity between brackets indicates the phase stability limits. Among many perovskite-type mixed conducting oxides, the Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF5582) composite has received considerable attentions in recent years [11\u201320] . It was first reported by Shao et al. as an oxygen permeating membrane material, developed by a 50% substitution of Sr 2+ in SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 with a larger size cation of Ba 2+ [11,12] . High oxygen permeation flux and favorable phase stability were reported for this material [11,12] . Very recently, Shao et al. also proposed the application of BSCF5582 as a cathode material for intermediate temperature SOFCs with promising performances [21,22] . On the other hand, the BSCF5582 oxide has two main drawbacks including high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) and low chemical stability. A thermal expansion coefficient of \u223c24 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 was reported [23] . Both the high TEC and low chemical stability are closely related with the high cobalt concentration in the structure. Cobalt ions are easily reduced by a reducing atmosphere. On the other hand, iron may be another most popular compositional metal ion in the B-site of perovskite. The LaFeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 is much more stable as compared to LaCoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 [7] , which indicates that iron ion has a much higher chemical stability in a/the perovskite structure under the same conditions. The other benefit of having iron ion in perovskite is the reduced thermal expansion coefficient. A steady decrease in TEC was observed with the increase of iron doping concentration in La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [24] . The modification of BSCF structure with other metal ions and their application as oxygen permeating membrane and cathode of SOFCs have been well studied [25\u201327] . However, there are little published results about the effect of iron doping concentration on the properties of BSCF. In this study, Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF, y = 0\u20131.0) with varied iron concentration ( y = 0.0\u20131.0) was synthesized by a sol\u2013gel method. The influence of Fe/Co ratio in BSCF on the properties of the oxides was investigated. Their performance as ceramic oxygen permeating membranes and symmetrical cell electrodes was systematically studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 powders were synthesized through a combined citrate and EDTA complexing method. Appropriate amounts of Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Sr(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (analytical grades) were used as the raw materials for metal source. The details for the synthesis of materials can be found elsewhere [11] . The disk-shaped membranes to be used in the oxygen permeation test were prepared by uni-axial pressing with 280 MPa. The green disks were sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 5 h in air at a heating/cooling rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The sintered membranes had a diameter of \u223c14 mm and were polished to the thickness of about 1.1 mm. The membranes had a relative density greater than 95% as measured by the Archimedes method. 2.2 Characterization The crystal structure of synthesized powders was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu K\u03b1 1 radiation. The lattice parameters of the powders were calculated using the UnitCell program [28] . The oxygen nonstoichiometry at room temperature was measured by the iodometry titration technique. The oxygen nonstoichiometry under various atmospheres at high temperature was determined by the TGA process using a NETZSCH STA 409 thermal gravity analyzer. The samples were obtained from calcination at the aimed temperature for 5 h at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 in air, and the TGA test was performed to the samples immediately after they cooled down to room temperature from calcination. No annealing was conducted in order to ensure identical conditions for the TGA measurements and iodometry titration. The electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe DC method on sintered bars of BSCF. The measurements were performed under a heating condition and a cooling condition under different atmospheres of oxygen, air and argon, respectively. The cooling process decreased the temperature from 900 to 300 \u00b0C at an interval of 5 \u00b0C per step. At each temperature step, the stabilization time was 2 min; the heating process was performed from 300 to 900 \u00b0C also at 5 \u00b0C per step in every test with the same stabilization time. Very close results were obtained from the two processes, with the largest discrepancies between the conductivity values no larger than 2%. Silver paste was painted on the edges of the sample to form current and voltage electrodes. Two silver wires acted as current contacts and another two, acting as voltage contacts, were attached to the electrodes using silver paste. A constant current was applied to the two current wires and the voltage response on the two voltage wires were recorded using a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to a maximum value of 2 A. The conductivity was calculated based on the following equation: \u03c3 = L A \u00d7 K where A is the cross-sectional area, L the length and K is the slope of the curve of current versus voltage. 2.3 Symmetrical cell electrode tests The cathode performance of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 powders with SDC electrolyte was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique based on the symmetrical cell configuration. The Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 slurry was prepared by mixing the powders in an organic solvent, which was then spray-deposited on both surfaces of SDC pellet with a thickness of about 10 \u03bcm. Then the cell was calcined at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h in air to obtain a symmetrical cell with porous electrodes. Silver paste was coated on both surfaces of the cell as the current collector. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was tested by Solartron SI 1287 + 1260. 2.4 Oxygen permeation test The oxygen permeation flux measurements were performed with a gas chromatograph method. Membranes were sealed with a silver paste onto the quartz support tube. The sidewall of the membrane disk was also covered with the sealant to avoid leakage and radial contribution to the oxygen flux. Ambient air was used as the feed gas (oxygen rich side atmosphere) and helium with a flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 (STP) as the sweep gas (oxygen lean side atmosphere). A gas chromatograph (CP 3800, Varian) was used to analyze the outlet gas. The oxygen permeation flux was calculated by J O 2 ( mol \u2009 c m \u2212 2 \u2009 s \u2212 1 , STP ) = C O \u2212 C N \u00d7 0.21 0.79 \u00d7 28 32 1 / 2 \u00d7 F S where C O and C N are the measured concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen in the gas on the sweep side, respectively, F the flow rate of the exit gas on the sweep side, and S is the membrane geometric surface area of the sweep side (cm 2 ). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure and oxygen nonstoichiometry The room-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns of the sol\u2013gel synthesized Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) oxides with y = 0.0\u20131.0 are shown in Fig. 1 . The perovskite structure was formed for the iron-doping concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0. The XRD pattern of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSC, y = 0) could be indexed using an oxygen vacancy-ordered 2-H type hexagonal perovskite structure, while an oxygen vacancy-disordered cubic perovskite structure, space group Pm 3 m , was formed for all other compositions. On the other hand, the air-calcined SrFeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 and BaFeO 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides, prepared by parallel experiments under synthesis conditions similar to BSF, displayed oxygen vacancy-ordered tetragonal and rhombohedral structures, respectively. It suggests that the mixed doping at both the A-site and B-site was important to maintain the oxygen-vacancy disordered structure of the oxides. It was proposed that the mixed doping disrupted the uniform periodic potential required to form ordered structures [29] . The increase of the iron doping level led to the shift of the corresponding diffraction peaks to higher diffraction angles as shown in Fig. 1 . The calculated lattice constant for various iron concentrations is shown in Fig. 2 . A decrease of lattice constant ( a ) with the increase of iron concentration was observed, opposite to the case of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [24] . Since Ba 2+ and Sr 2+ took the fixed valence state (2+) in perovskite, the lattice constant for BSCF was mainly determined by the radius of the B-site ions. Cobalt and iron can both take multi-valence states at the B-site of the perovskite, and iron has a larger ionic radius than cobalt at the same valence state [30] . Therefore, iron should take a higher average valence state than cobalt in BSCF oxides. This assumption is supported by the room-temperature oxygen nonstoichiometry of the oxides as shown in Table 1 . Generally, the higher the iron content, the smaller the nonstoichiometry observed for the BSCF oxides ( y = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) from two calcination temperatures measured by the iodometry techniques. Mixed conducting oxides are capable of oxygen uptake and release from their lattice during heating and cooling processes, which is closely related to the lattice expansion/shrinkage and oxygen nonstoichiometry of the oxides. The lattice expansion associated with the oxygen release can be attributed to: (1) the repulsion force arising between those mutually exposed cations when oxygen ions are released from the lattice; (2) the increase in cation size due to the reduction of Fe and Co ions (for BSCF) from a higher to a lower valence state, which occurs simultaneously with the release of oxygen from lattice in order to maintain the electrical neutrality. The release or uptake of oxygen also results in the change of oxygen nonstoichiometry of the oxides, which may have significant influence on the cathode performance or oxygen permeation behavior of the membrane made of the materials. TGA measurements were then performed in order to accurately measure the oxygen nonstoichiometry of BSCF at elevated temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3 , all the materials with different iron concentrations started to lose weight at a temperature around 400 \u00b0C. The weight loss was associated with the oxygen release from the lattice as detected by the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiment using a Mass Spectroscopy (Hiden QIC-20). It suggests the lattice oxygen starts to be active at a temperature of \u223c400 \u00b0C. As a whole, the higher the iron concentration the larger the weight loss observed. A weight loss as large as \u223c2.5% was observed for selected BSCF oxides with a high iron concentration. Although a larger oxygen release was observed for BSCF at the higher iron concentration, the smaller starting nonstoichiometry resulted in the final oxygen nonstoichiometry at high temperature for different materials without a big difference. 3.2 Total electrical conductivity For any potential candidate for cathode of SOFCs or material of ceramic oxygen permeating membrane, a high electrical conductivity is important, since a low electronic conductivity may result in a poor current-collecting efficiency and a large ohmic resistance of cathode in SOFCs. For oxygen permeating membranes, it is well established that the oxygen permeation flux though a mixed conducting membrane can be expressed as J O 2 = \u2212 R T / 4 2 F 2 L \u222b ln \u2061 P \u2032 O 2 ln \u2061 P \u2033 O 2 ( \u03c3 ion \u03c3 el ) / ( \u03c3 ion + \u03c3 el ) d [ ln \u2061 P O 2 ] under the condition of the bulk transport process as the rate-determining step. Therefore, high electronic and ionic conductivities are also important to oxygen permeability of the membrane based on the equation. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the total electrical conductivity of BSCF with y = 0\u20131.0 measured in an oxygen, air and argon atmosphere, respectively. For the cases of air and pure oxygen, the conductivity of all the samples with different iron concentrations experienced a first increase with temperature, reaching a maximum, and then a decrease with further increased in operation temperature. The maximum electrical conductivity was reached at around 400 \u00b0C for most of the samples. Together with the TGA results in Fig. 3 , the decrease in electrical conductivity at temperatures higher than 400 \u00b0C was closely related to the release of lattice oxygen from the oxides. The release of oxygen resulted in the increase of oxygen vacancy concentration. Since oxygen vacancy is the carrier for oxygen ion and since it is a well-known fact that oxygen vacancy diffusion rate increases with temperature, an increase in ionic conductivity with temperature should be expected. The decrease of total conductivity with the increase of operation temperature at T > 400 \u00b0C was therefore attributed to the decrease of electronic conductivity, which is generally believed to be caused by the hopping of small polarons associated with the tetravalent state of the iron and cobalt cations. The release of oxygen from BSCF lattice changes the relative concentrations of various valence states of cobalt and iron ions, and therefore affects the electronic conductivity. Under the more reducing atmosphere of argon ( P O 2 \u2248 10 \u22125 atm), the conductivity displayed a monotonous increase with temperature. The increase of conductivity with the increase of oxygen partial pressure demonstrated the p-type conductivity mechanism for all the BSCF samples with varied iron concentrations. As a whole, the higher the iron doping level is, the lower the conductivity is. It agrees well with the fact that the mobility of p-type carrier of iron is much lower than that of cobalt. The same trend of decreasing electrical conductivity with the increase of iron concentration was also observed in the system of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 [24] . A maximum conductivity of \u223c40 S cm \u22121 was reached for BSCF5582 at \u223c450 \u00b0C under air, which is substantially lower than that of the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxide with the same composition at the B-site of perovskite (\u223c1000 S cm \u22121 ) [24] . For the mixed-conducting perovskite via the doping strategy such as BSCF and LSCF, in order to maintain charge neutrality, the A-site acceptor dopant (Ba 2+ , Sr 2+ ) should be compensated through either one or both of the following ways: (1) electronic compensation by the conversion of the B-site ions to a higher valence state, such as Fe 3+ /Co 3+ to Fe 4+ /Co 4+ , (2) and/or ionic compensation by the formation of oxygen vacancies. Based on the oxygen nonstoichiometry and the electrical conductivity data, BSCF preferred the charge neutrality compensation via the creation of oxygen vacancies as compared with LSCF. A higher oxygen vacancy concentration means more carriers for oxygen ion transport; therefore, a higher oxygen ionic conductivity is expected for BSCF than LSCF. The high oxygen ionic conductivity then ensures the high oxygen permeability of the membrane and the improved cathode performance. 3.3 Cathode performance BSCF5582 has been reported to deliver very promising cathode performances at intermediate temperatures with the SDC-based electrolyte in SOFCs [21,22] . The high cathode performance originated from the high oxygen ionic conductivity and surface exchange kinetics of the oxide [21] . The effect of iron doping level in BSCF on the cathode performance with SDC electrolyte was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique based on the symmetrical cell configuration. Due to the low electrical conductivity of BSCF at high iron concentrations, silver paste was applied as the current collector for all the samples. It is worth noticing that the Ag particles played an important role in the improvement of cathode performance, which not only served as the current collector. The reasons are as follows. First of all, partial melting and volatilization of Ag are expected in the course of sintering. Second, oxygen incorporation into Ag under both anodic and catholic conditions leads to the formation of Ag\u2013O solution with a low melting point. These factors may both lead to Ag penetration into the electrode layer and lead to direct contact between BSCF and Ag particles. Also, it is well known that Ag can absorb O 2 on its surface and let them dissolve into it. In addition, Ag particles can improve the electron supply through a porous structure. Based on these reasons, Ag helped to improve the cathode performance in this study. The as-synthesized BSCF powder was prepared into slurry and spray-deposited onto the both surfaces of SDC pellets with a thickness of \u223c10 \u03bcm. The obtained cells were then calcined in a static air atmosphere at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h to result in the symmetrical cell with well-attached porous BSCF layers. Figs. 5 and 6 shows the complex plane-plot of impedance spectra at 600 \u00b0C and the temperature dependence of the area specific resistances (ASRs) of BSCF at various iron doping levels, respectively. The impedance spectra were evaluated using an equivalent circuit with a configuration of LR ohm ( RQ ) HF ( RQ ) LF , where R ohm is the overall ohmic resistances including the electrolyte resistance, electrode ohmic resistance and lead resistance. L is the inductance, which could be due to the Ag current/voltage probes or the high frequency phase shift of electrochemical equipments. R is a resistance, Q a constant phase element, and the subscripts \u201cHF\u201d and \u201cLF\u201d represent the respective high- and low-frequency contributions. The difference between realaxes intercepts of the impedance plot is considered to be the electrode polarization resistance ( R p ). An increase in the ASRs was observed with the increase of iron concentration in BSCF. For example, an ASR value of 0.085, 0.13, 0.166, 0.3612, and 0.613 \u03a9 cm 2 was observed at 600 \u00b0C for BSCF with y = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. A corresponding increase of the activation energy was also observed, with a value of 106.0, 120.2, 121.7, 123.8, and 139.5 kJ mol \u22121 for y = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. It suggests that cobalt is more beneficial than iron for oxygen electrochemical reduction. Anyway, BSF ( y = 1.0) still showed very promising cathode performance for oxygen reduction at intermediate temperatures. Although the decrease in the performance for oxygen reduction at reduced temperature was compared to BSCF5582, the increased chemical stability and low cost of iron than cobalt makes BSCF with high iron concentration, for example BSCF5528, a highly attractive candidate as cathode for IT-SOFCs. However, due to its poor electronic conductivity, the formation of composite cathode with a high electronic conductive phase, such as Ag, is critical for its application in SOFCs in order to reduce the ohmic polarization and improvement of current collecting efficiency. The long-term performance for SOFC was tested by symmetric cell configuration, and also in real complete fuel cell condition. A stable operation was observed for the symmetric cell configuration, while a stable slow decrease of the power density and open circuit voltage was observed based on the complete cell configuration. Due to the hydrogen embrittlement for silver under hydrogen atmosphere, many micro pores had formed over the sealant, which led to the increased hydrogen leakage with time and thus accounting to the decrease of power density for the tested SOFC. A better sealing material is necessary for future long-term stability test based on the complete fuel cell configuration. The influence of Ag paste on the cathode performance will be studied in our future work. 3.4 Oxygen permeation properties Besides the potential application as the cathode material in IT-SOFCs, another promising application of mixed-conducting oxides is as oxygen semi-permeable membrane. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of oxygen permeation fluxes through various BSCF membranes with different iron concentrations. The experiments were conducted with the one side of membrane surface exposed to ambient air and the other side of membrane surface swept with a constant helium flow of 100 ml min \u22121 (STP). It was found that the permeation flux decreased steadily with the increase of iron concentration. However, the difference of oxygen permeation fluxes between the membranes with y = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, or y = 0.8 and 1.0 was much smaller than that between y = 0.6 and 0.8. A sharp decrease in the permeation flux was observed for BSCF membranes with the increase of iron concentration from y = 0.6 to 0.8. A permeation flux as high as 2.28 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 s \u22121 (STP) was reached for BSCF5582 ( y = 0.2) at 900 \u00b0C, comparable to the value reported in literature [31] with a similar precious metal sealing. While it reached only \u223c0.45 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 s \u22121 (STP) for BSF ( y = 1.0) under similar operation conditions. As mentioned above, Ag can absorb O 2 on its surface and let it dissolve into it. But the oxygen transport rate through Ag membrane is relatively low compared to BSCF [32] , so its influence is negligible. Ag paste can enhance the electron transport through the surface of BSCF, which may improve the oxygen permeation flux. Oxygen permeation through conducting membrane is a complex process, which involves the oxygen adsorption and dissociation at the feed side membrane surface, the diffusion of oxygen ion through bulk of the membrane from the high oxygen partial pressure membrane surface to the opposite membrane surface and the re-combination of oxygen ion into molecular oxygen and desorption into the gas atmosphere. Both the oxygen bulk diffusion and the oxygen surface exchange at both or either side of the two membrane surfaces could be the rate-limiting step in oxygen permeation process. The investigation of oxygen partial pressure dependence of permeation flux has been applied to get the information of the rate-determination step in the permeation process [33] . Under the control of bulk diffusion and the overwhelming electronic conductivity, the permeation flux through a mixed conducing membrane can be expressed by: (1) J O 2 = \u2212 R T 4 2 F 2 L \u22c5 \u222b ln \u2061 P \u2032 O 2 ln \u2061 P \u2033 O 2 \u03c3 ion \u22c5 d ln \u2061 [ P O 2 ] = a [ ( P \u2032 O 2 ) n \u2212 ( P \u2033 O 2 ) n ] where P \u2032 O 2 and P \u2033 O 2 are the oxygen partial pressures at the feed side and sweep side atmosphere, respectively, and n is the power coefficient, indicating the creation speed of oxygen vacancy with the change of ambient oxygen partial pressure. The P O 2 dependence of experimental permeation flux usually can also be well fitted to this equation at the condition of surface-limiting or a mixed bulk diffusion-surface exchange limiting of the permeation process. Since the oxygen ionic conductivity increases with the decrease of oxygen partial pressure due to the increase of oxygen vacancy concentration, a negative value of n should be observed under the oxygen bulk diffusion control of the permeation process. A positive value of derived n may suggest the rate determination by the slow oxygen surface exchange kinetics or a combined surface exchange-bulk diffusion process [33] . Fig. 8 shows the dependence of oxygen partial pressure on oxygen permeation flux through BSCF membranes on the sweep side with different iron concentration ( y = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) with air being the feed-side atmosphere ( P \u2032 O 2 = 0.21 atm). A steady increase of the permeation flux with the decrease of oxygen partial pressure at the sweep side ( P \u2033 O 2 ) was observed for all the composition. The dependence of oxygen partial pressure on permeation flux can be well fitted to Eq. (1) . The derived values for a and n at various P \u2033 O 2 ranges for various BSCF membranes are listed in Table 2 . The change of n from positive at y = 0.4 to negative at y = 0.2 was observed, which strongly suggests that a change in the rate-determination step in oxygen permeation process happened simultaneously. It was reported that the oxygen permeation through BSCF5582 was mainly rate-determined by the relatively slow surface exchange kinetics at the sweep-side membrane surface [33] . The rate limited by the slow oxygen bulk diffusion of the permeation process through BSCF5528 membrane was then proposed based on the negative value of n . If the oxygen permeation through a conducting membrane was rate-determined mainly by the slow surface exchange kinetics, the surface modification with a porous layer of oxide with much higher surface exchange kinetics than the membrane itself would result in a sharp increase of the permeation flux. However, if it is mainly rate-limited by the slow oxygen bulk diffusion, no significant increase in permeation flux would be observed via the surface modification. BSCF5582 was reported to have very a high oxygen bulk diffusion rate and oxygen surface exchange rate [21] . The high surface exchange rate is supported by the low cathode polarization resistance as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 in this study. Therefore, a porous layer of BSCF5582 was deposited onto the surface of BSCF5528 membrane by the spray-deposition technique to investigate the influence of surface modification on the oxygen permeation behavior of BSCF5528 membrane. Fig. 9 shows the oxygen permeation fluxes through the BSCF5528 membranes at 900 \u00b0C and the condition with and without the surface modification by porous BSCF5582. It shows that the oxygen permeation flux was only slightly improved for the surface modified ones as compared to those without the porous layer. It suggests that the permeation process through BSCF5528 was mainly rate-limited by the slow oxygen bulk diffusion. Therefore, in order to increase the oxygen permeation flux through BSCF membrane with high iron concentration (for example BSCF5528), the thin film membrane technology should be applied. Based on the results in Fig. 9 , the oxygen surface exchange over the air-side membrane surface had relatively more importance in the rate-limiting step than that of the sweep-side membrane surface. This is significantly different from the case of BSCF5582 [33] . The results shown in Figs. 5, 6, 8 and 9 suggest that the increase of iron concentration in BSCF has a more significant influence on the oxygen bulk diffusion rate than the surface exchange kinetics of the oxides. 4 Conclusions The iron doping concentration has a significant effect on the lattice constant, oxygen nonstoichiometry, and electrical conductivity of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 oxides. The iron ion has a higher average valence state than the cobalt ion in BSCF, which resulted in the decrease of the lattice constant of the cubic perovskite structure and the oxygen nonstoichiometry with the increase of the iron concentration. All BSCF oxides with different iron concentrations demonstrated the p-type electrical conductivity. The increase in iron concentration resulted in the decrease of electrical conductivity. Favorable cathode performance was observed for BSCF oxide even at high iron concentrations, although an increase in the area specific resistance was observed with the increase of iron doping level. The ceramic membranes made of BSCF resulted in a high oxygen permeation flux with a maximum value of 2.28 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 s \u22121 (STP) at 900 \u00b0C under a helium sweep rate of 100 ml min \u22121 (STP) for BSCF5582. The increase of iron concentration in BSCF had a more significant influence on the decrease of the oxygen bulk diffusion rate than the surface exchange kinetics of the oxides, which resulted in a change of the rate-determination step of oxygen permeation process from the slow oxygen surface exchange to the slow oxygen bulk diffusion with the increase of the iron doping concentration. The formation of composite oxide with a proper electronic conducting phase and the thin film technology are important for the BSCF oxide with a high iron concentration as cathode in IT-SOFCs and oxygen permeating membranes, respectively.

The crystal structure, electrical conductivity, sintering behavior and oxygen desorption property of the oxides were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), four-probe direct current (DC) conductivity, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) technologies, respectively. At x = 0.0-0.15, BSCF had a cubic perovskite structure, the lattice parameter and electrical conductivity both decreased steadily with increasing A-site deficiency. The A-site deficiency resulted in the increasing oxygen vacancy concentration in the lattice structure and improved the sintering of the oxides. BSCF (x = 0.03) showed the highest oxygen permeability with the flux reaching 3.5 \u00d7 10-6 mol cm-2 s-1 [STP: standard temperature and pressure] at 900 \u00b0C through a 1.0 mm thickness membrane. Long-term stability test of BSCF (x = 0.03) membrane at 850 \u00b0C indicated a slight deterioration of the permeation flux, which was attributed in part to the increased A-site deficiency of the bulk from Ba2+ and Sr2+ segregation over the membrane surface. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) convert chemical energy directly into electric power in a highly efficient way. Lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs to around 500\u2013800 \u00b0C is one of the main goals in current SOFC research. The associated benefits include reducing the difficulties associated with sealing and thermal degradation, allowing the use of low-cost metallic interconnectors and suppressing reactions between the cell components. However, the electrochemical activity of the cathode deteriorates dramatically with decreasing temperature for the typical La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 -based electrodes. The cathode becomes the limiting factor in determining the overall cell performance. Therefore, the development of new electrodes with high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction becomes a critical issue for intermediate-temperature (IT)-SOFCs. Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) perovskite oxide was first reported as a potential IT-SOFC cathode material in 2004 by Shao and Haile. After that, the BSCF cathode has attracted considerable attention. This paper reviews the current research activities on BSCF-based cathodes for IT-SOFCs. Emphasis will be placed on the understanding and optimization of BSCF-based materials. The issues raised by the BSCF cathode are also presented and analyzed to provide some guidelines in the search for the new generation of cathode materials for IT-SOFCs.",

        "abstract": "Novel \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 supported nickel (Ni/Al 2 O 3 ) catalyst was developed as a functional layer for Ni\u2013ScSZ cermet anode operating on methane fuel. Catalytic tests demonstrated Ni/Al 2 O 3 had high and comparable activity to Ru\u2013CeO 2 and much higher activity than the Ni\u2013ScSZ cermet anode for partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas between 750 and 850 \u00b0C. By adopting Ni/Al 2 O 3 as a catalyst layer, the fuel cell demonstrated a peak power density of 382 mW cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C, more than two times that without the catalyst layer. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 also functioned as a diffusion barrier layer to reduce the methane concentration within the anode; consequently, the operation stability was also greatly improved without coke deposition. Keywords Solid-oxide fuel cells Ni/Al 2 O 3 Methane Coke Nickel\u2013ScSZ cermet 1 Introduction Fuel cells are electrochemical energy conversion devices characterized by high fuel efficiency and low emissions. A solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is typically composed of nickel-based cermet anode, oxide electrolyte and oxide cathode. A major advantage of SOFCs is their fuel flexibility because of high operation temperature [1] . Methane is the simplest and widely available hydrocarbon with a huge resource in the world. It is the main component of natural gas and coal gas. It is also the main component of biogas and can be treated as a renewable energy resource. Nowadays, there is a great interest of SOFC operating on methane fuel [2,3] . Typically there are three routes available for operating on methane fuel in a SOFC, i.e., direct electrochemical conversion, external reforming and internal reforming [4\u20136] . The later route is superior to external reforming because of their simplicity. State-of-the-art SOFC anodes are composed of nickel-based cermets which show high electrical conductivity and excellent activity for hydrogen electrochemical oxidation. However, sintered nickel has high catalytic activity towards hydrocarbon cracking reaction. Coke is easily formed over anode surface and causes rapid deterioration of the fuel cell performance when hydrocarbons are applied as the fuels. Most recently, the concept of applying a Ru\u2013CeO 2 functional layer over a conventional nickel-based cermet anode has been proposed [7] , which allows high-efficient internal reforming of hydrocarbons over the thin catalyst layer without coke formation. However, the high cost of ruthenium becomes the major hurdle for commercialization. Development of alternative cost-attractive catalyst layer is then of great importance for practical operation of SOFC on methane fuel. In this paper, an \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 supported nickel catalyst was proposed for the first time as a dual-functional layer over traditional Ni\u2013ScSZ anode for operating on methane fuel. The new catalyst showed favorable activity for partial oxidation, steam and CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas (CO + H 2 ) at intermediate temperatures. By adopting Ni/Al 2 O 3 layer high fuel cell performance and excellent carbon coking resistance were achieved. 2 Experimental Both 7 wt.% Ni\u2013Al 2 O 3 and 7 wt.% Ru\u2013CeO 2 powders, investigated as the materials for the catalyst layer, were synthesized by a glycine nitrite process according to Ref. [8] . The fuel cell materials include the cathode La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 (LSM) and the electrolyte (Sc 2 O 3 ) 0.1 (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (ScSZ) were prepared by an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process. The fuel cell adopted in this study is 60 wt.% NiO + 40 wt.% ScSZ anode-supported thin film ScSZ electrolyte fuel cell (\u223c20 \u03bcm) fabricated by a dual dry pressing/sintering process. The catalytic activity of the catalysts and anode material was studied in a flow-through type fixed-bed quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c6 mm. About 0.2 g catalyst particles in the size of 60\u201380 meshes was dropped into the middle of the reactor, the gas mixture of He\u2013CH 4 \u2013O 2 , He\u2013CH 4 \u2013CO 2 or He\u2013CH 4 \u2013H 2 O at targeted mole ratio was introduced from the top of the reactor, the effluent gases from the bottom of the reactor was introduced to a Varian 3800 gas chromatography for compositional analysis at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C. Typically methane was kept at 10 ml min \u22121 [standard temperature pressure, STP] while the diluting gas of helium at 80\u2013100 ml min \u22121 [STP]. The I \u2013 V polarization of the cells was measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter at 4-probe mode at 750\u2013850 \u00b0C. Methane fuel or a mixture of CH 4 \u2013O 2 , CH 4 \u2013CO 2 or CH 4 \u2013H 2 O was fed into the anode chamber at a flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP]. Ambient air was served as the oxidant gas at the cathode chamber. The cross-sectional morphologies of the fuel cell were examined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-5610LV). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalytic activity The catalytic activity of Ni/Al 2 O 3 for partial oxidation, steam reforming, and CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas (CO + H 2 ) were first investigated at methane to O 2 , H 2 O and CO 2 mole ratios of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:1, respectively. For comparison the catalytic activity of 7 wt.% Ru\u2013CeO 2 and Ni\u2013ScSZ anode for such reactions was also conducted. As the catalyst layer, the Ni/Al 2 O 3 was fired onto the anode surface at 850 \u00b0C while the anode was co-sintered with electrolyte at 1500 \u00b0C for the densification of the electrolyte layer. Thereby, for the catalysis evaluation, the Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalysts were fired at 850 \u00b0C for 5 h while the Ni\u2013ScSZ catalyst was sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h. Table 1 lists the methane conversions and CO selectivity at 850, 800 and 750 \u00b0C over the three catalysts. Ni/Al 2 O 3 demonstrated comparable catalytic activity for methane partial oxidation to that of Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst. Both catalysts showed much better catalytic activity than the Ni\u2013ScSZ. For example, at 750 \u00b0C, the methane conversion/CO selectivity are 94%/99%, 96%/98% and 16%/3.5% for Ni/Al 2 O 3 , Ru\u2013CeO 2 and Ni\u2013ScSZ catalysts, respectively. Besides its excellent catalytic activity for methane partial oxidation, Ni/Al 2 O 3 also shows favorable catalytic activity for methane steam and CO 2 reforming reactions. It shows even a slightly higher catalytic activity than Ru\u2013CeO 2 catalyst for such reactions while the Ni\u2013ScSZ anode had very poor activity. The methane conversion reached more than 94% for all above three reactions at 750 \u00b0C over Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst while it is only 16\u201337% when Ni\u2013ScSZ was the catalyst. 3.2 Cell performance One cell whose anode surface was modified with a thin Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer (20 \u03bcm) prepared by spray deposition followed by firing at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h. Table 2 lists the peak power density (PPD) at 850 \u00b0C operated on gas stream composed of methane and oxygen mixture at various mole ratios. When pure methane was applied as the fuel, the cell with the catalyst layer delivered a PPD of 382 mW cm \u22122 , which is 2.51 times that of the cell without the catalyst layer (152 mW cm \u22122 ). Since the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was deposited over the anode which has a thickness of \u223c600 \u03bcm while the active zone for electrochemical oxidation of fuel is only about tens of micron away from the electrolyte interface [9] , thereby the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer should be inert for the electrochemical oxidation of the fuel. In connection with the catalytic results, the improved cell performance was then attributed to the increased catalytic activity for CO 2 and steam reforming of methane to syngas via the introduction of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 layer. The effect of the reaction with methane and the products on the polarization resistance has been proposed by some researchers [2,10,11] . Under polarization, electrochemical oxidation products of CO 2 and H 2 O were produced, which reacted with the methane under the catalysis of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer to produce H 2 and CO. The formed CO and H 2 then diffused to the anode layer where they were electrochemically oxidized to produce H 2 O, CO 2 and electricity. Since CO and H 2 have higher electrochemical activity than methane, it then well-explained the improved cell performance with the introduction of Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer by operating on pure methane. As shown in Table 2 , the increase in oxygen to methane mole ratio first envisaged an increase in PPD slightly, reached the maximum PPD at CH 4 to O 2 mole ratio of 4:1 and then decreased with the further increase of oxygen concentration. The increased power density when introducing proper amount of oxygen into the fuel stream was attributed to the increased H 2 concentration due to the partial oxidation of methane to syngas over the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer. However, too much oxygen would induce the deep oxidation of methane and resulted in a decrease in hydrogen concentration with the further increase in O 2 concentration in the feed gas. The fuel cell performance without and with the catalyst layer was then further investigated in detail at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1 a and b, when no catalyst layer was applied, the peak power densities at 750, 775, 800, 825 and 850 \u00b0C are 75, 95, 126, 165 and 231 mW cm \u22122 , respectively, while the corresponding power densities increased to 293, 325, 373, 406 and 456 mW cm \u22122 when the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was applied. 3.3 Operation stability To examine the operation stability, pure methane was applied as the fuel at the flow rate of 40 ml min \u22121 [STP] and the PPD with time was monitored periodically. As shown in Fig. 1 c is the dependence of PPD on operation time. When no Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was adopted, after operation on methane stream for 90 min, the PPD reduced to about \u223c41% of the initial value, while the decrease in PPD was just about 3% when Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer was adopted and it was still only 4% after operation on methane fuel for about 150 min. It clearly indicates that the application of a Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer increased the operation stability of the fuel cell significantly. SEM images of the fuel cell after testing at 850\u2013750 \u00b0C with a total period of \u223c25 h are shown in Fig. 2 , the catalyst layer still adhered to the anode surface pretty well without any delimitation observed. Furthermore, no any carbon deposition was observed over both the anode surface and the Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst surface. It is well-known that Ni/Al 2 O 3 has good resistance towards the coke formation due to the interaction between nickel and alumina substrate [12] while coke is easily formed over Ni\u2013ScSZ anode when operating on methane [13] . In reality, no carbon formation over the Ni\u2013ScSZ anode was observed which can be explained by the barrier effect of the catalyst layer. Recently Lin et al. also demonstrated that the cell operation stability on methane fuel could be greatly improved by adopting an anode gas diffusion barrier layer [14] . As shown in Fig. 2 , the catalyst layer has a much denser morphology than the porous Ni\u2013ScSZ cermet that caused a gas diffusion barrier for methane into the anode layer. The diffusion barrier effect of the catalyst layer was supported by the appearance of concentration polarization at high current density in I \u2013 V curves as shown in Fig. 1 b. The gas diffusion limitation within the Ni/Al 2 O 3 layer then decreased the methane content and increased the product content within the nickel anode layer. 4 Conclusions The 7 wt.% nickel supported on \u03b3-Al 2 O 3 (Ni/Al 2 O 3 ) catalyst had excellent and comparable catalytic activity to that of Ru\u2013CeO 2 for partial oxidation, steam reforming and CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas reactions between 750 and 850 \u00b0C. By adopting Ni/Al 2 O 3 as the catalyst layer over the typical Ni\u2013ScSZ anode, the peak power density reached 382 mW cm \u22122 when operating on pure methane at 850 \u00b0C, more than two times that of the cell without the catalyst layer. The Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst layer also functioned as a gas diffusion barrier which effectively increased the O 2\u2212 to methane ratio within the anode and suppressed the coke formation thereby increased the cell operation stability. The much cheaper price of Ni/Al 2 O 3 and the excellent catalytic properties promise its application in methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells.

        "abstract": "A novel Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 - \u03b4 + LaCoO3 (BSCF + LC) composite oxide was investigated for the potential application as a cathode for intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells based on a Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) electrolyte. The LC oxide was added to BSCF cathode in order to improve its electrical conductivity. X-ray diffraction examination demonstrated that the solid-state reaction between LC and BSCF phases occurred at temperatures above 950 \u00b0C and formed the final product with the composition: La0.316Ba0.342Sr0.342Co0.863Fe0.137O3 - \u03b4 at 1100 \u00b0C. The inter-diffusion between BSCF and LC was identified by the environmental scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray examination. The electrical conductivity of the BSCF + LC composite oxide increased with increasing calcination temperature, and reached a maximum value of \u223c300 S cm-1 at a calcination temperature of 1050 \u00b0C, while the electrical conductivity of the pure BSCF was only \u223c40 S cm-1. The improved conductivity resulted in attractive cathode performance. An area-specific resistance as low as 0.21 \u03a9 cm2 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C for the BSCF (70 vol.%) + LC (30 vol.%) composite cathode calcined at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h. Peak power densities as high as \u223c700 mW cm-2 at 650 \u00b0C and \u223c525 mW cm-2 at 600 \u00b0C were reached for the thin-film fuel cells with the optimized cathode composition and calcination temperatures. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "We proposed a novel way to improve the cell performance of proton-conducting solid-oxide fuel cells by increasing the chemical interaction between the anode components using BaZr 0.4 Ce 0.4 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 (BZCY4) as the ionic conducting phase of anode for a fuel cell with a BaCe 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212\u03b4 (BCY) electrolyte. The strength of the chemical interaction between NiO and the ionic conducting phase (BZCY4 or BCY) was analyzed by the hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) technique. The effect of chemical interaction between NiO and the ionic conducting phase on the NiO diffusivity was investigated by SEM-EDX. The results demonstrated NiO had a much stronger interaction with BZCY4 than with BCY, thereby resulting in suppressed diffusivity of NiO into the BCY electrolyte. Using BZCY4 as the ionic conducting phase of the anode, a cell with an ohmic resistance of 0.65\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm 2 at 700\u00a0\u00b0C was obtained. In contrast, a cell with BCY as the ionic conducting phase of the anode had an ohmic resistance of 0.82\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm 2 at 700\u00a0\u00b0C. Therefore, the single cell with NiO\u00a0+\u00a0BZCY4 anode showed a peak power density higher than that of the cell with the NiO\u00a0+\u00a0BCY anode.",

        "title": "Process investigation, electrochemical characterization and optimization of LiFePO4/C composite from mechanical activation using sucrose as carbon source",
        "abstract": "LiFePO 4 /C composite was synthesized by mechanical activation using sucrose as carbon source. High-energy ball milling facilitated phase formation during thermal treatment. TG\u2013DSC and TPR experiments demonstrated sucrose was converted to CH x intermediate before completely decomposed to carbon. Ball milling time, calcination temperature and dwelling time all had significant impact on the discharge capacity and rate performance of the resulted power. The optimal process parameters are high-energy ball milling for 2\u20134 h followed by thermal treatment at 700 \u00b0C for 20 h. The product showed a capacity of 174 mAh/g at 0.1C rate and around 117 mAh/g at 20C rate with the capacity fade less than 10% after 50 cycles. Too low calcination temperature or insufficient calcination time, however, could result in the residual of CH x in the electrode and led to a decrease of electrode performance. Keywords Lithium-ion battery Cathode Sucrose LiFePO 4 Mechanical activation 1 Introduction Nowadays, there is a great interest in rechargeable lithium-ion battery for applications in electric and electric-hybrid vehicles and dispersed energy storage systems, which require much larger battery size than the portable electrical devices, such as cameras and laptop computers. Such applications also have stricter requirements on safety, high-rate performance, and volumetric/gravimetric energy density. It means LiCoO 2 , the currently widely applied positive electrode (cathode) material in commercial lithium-ion batteries, should be replaced. Orthorhombic lithium iron phosphate, LiFePO 4 , as first demonstrated by Padhi et al. [1] , is attracting considerable yet still increasing attention as a safe, low-cost and high-capacity cathode material for lithium-ion battery [2\u20138] , especially for application in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. Similar to Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode, the lithium insertion/extraction into LiFePO 4 cathode involves two-phase mechanism [9\u201312] . On lithium extraction, LiFePO 4 changes to FePO 4 , a material with a similar structure and a cell volume difference of only \u223c7% to LiFePO 4 [1] . Such characteristics ensure an excellent cycling stability. LiFePO 4 also features a favorable theoretical capacity around 170 mAh/g, a flat voltage curve with a plateau around 3.5 V vs. Li/Li + , high thermal and chemical stability, a wide safety margin of usage for many organic electrolytes, low material cost, low toxicity and improved safety [1] . The main drawbacks of the olivine-type LiFePO 4 include low electronic conductivity and low lithium-ion diffusivity. Serious polarization is typically observed under high charge/discharge rate, which results in a poor rate capacity. To overcome these drawbacks, three strategies are frequently applied: (i) reducing the grain size to lessen the diffusion distance for lithium ion inside the electrode bulk [13\u201315] , (ii) doping the lattice with foreign cations to increase the intrinsic electronic conductivity and lithium-ion diffusivity [16\u201318] and (iii) surface modification such as carbon coating to increase the electronic conductivity consequently the interfacial reaction kinetics [19\u201322] . On the other hand, the electrochemical performance of LiFePO 4 cathode also depends on a number of factors, e.g., phase purity, particle size and morphology, which are closely related with the synthesis technique and process parameters. Recently, a variety of techniques have been exploited for the synthesis of high-performance LiFePO 4 [23\u201327] . Mechanical activation, which involves the blending of ingredients by high-energy ball milling followed by thermal treatment at high temperature, has turned out to be a versatile technique with high capability for scale up [28\u201330] . The ball milling can reduce the particle size and create close contact of the reactants. Thereby, a decrease in the thermal treatment time and temperature is usually experienced during the following calcination to obtain a pure phase product. It then effectively avoids undesirable grain growth. Mechanical activation process also allows the in situ formation of carbon layer over LiFePO 4 when carbon black or a suitable organic/polymeric compound is incorporated as the carbon source during the synthesis. Besides performing as the coating material for LiFePO 4 , the carbon also acts as a reducing agent to suppress the oxidation of Fe 2+ to form Fe 3+ impurities during the synthesis. The carbon may further act as a diffusion barrier by blocking the particle contact, thereby suppressing the grain growth. Improved performance at high charge/discharge rate has been observed for the LiFePO 4 /C composite as compared to the LiFePO 4 prepared by the same technique but without adopting carbon additive [31] . Among various carbon raw materials for the coating layer, sucrose was found to be an excellent candidate [5] . Numerous studies have been conducted in literature on the synthesis of high-performance LiFePO 4 /C composite by applying sucrose as the carbon source [5,32\u201334] . However, most of the investigations were focused on the electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized samples. Very limited attention was paid to the synthesis process. Such information is, however, important guidance for further optimizing the material properties. In this study, the synthesis of LiFePO 4 /C composite cathode by a mechanical activation process applying sucrose as the carbon source was systematically investigated. Importance was paid to the synthesis process and the influence of process parameters on the electrochemical performance of the product. High electrochemical performance was achieved for the LiFePO 4 /C composite synthesized under optimal conditions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material synthesis LiFePO 4 /C was synthesized by a mechanical activation process followed by high-temperature calcination. Li 2 CO 3 , FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O and NH 4 H 2 PO 4 (all chemicals of >99% purity) were applied as the raw materials and sucrose was selected as the carbon source. They were weighed in stoichiometric amounts according to the nominal LiFePO 4 to C weight ratio 94 to 6, assuming the sucrose following the thermal pyrolysis reaction C 12 H 22 O 11 \u2192 12C + 11H 2 O. The ingredients together with 60% acetone were magnetically stirred at room temperature for 5 min, followed by high-energy ball milling in a zirconia container with zirconia balls (ball-to-powder weight ratio 10 to 3) at room temperature for different periods under an argon atmosphere using a Pulverisette-6 planner mill at 400 rpm. The as-obtained slurry was dried by evaporating the acetone liquid media under vacuum. Finally the solid precursors were fired at temperatures ranging from 500 to 900 \u00b0C for various hours in a tube furnace purging with pure nitrogen atmosphere. 2.2 Electrode fabrication The electrochemical cycling performance of LiFePO 4 or LiFePO 4 /C powders was tested with coin-shaped cells using metallic lithium film as the counter and reference electrode at room temperature (\u223c30 \u00b0C). The cells are based on the configuration of Li metal (\u2212)|electrolyte|LiFePO 4 (+) with a liquid electrolyte (1 M solution of LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)\u2013dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1, v/v). Microporous polypropylene film (Celgard 2400) was used as the separator [35] . Slurries composed of 85 wt.% LiFePO 4 with 10 wt.% conductive Super P (NCM HERSBIT Chemical Co., Ltd., China) and 5 wt.% LA-132 binder (Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co., Ltd., China) in de-ionized water were prepared, which were deposited on current collectors of 6 \u03bcm thick aluminum foils by blade. The electrode was dried under vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h before electrochemical evaluation. Cell assembly was conducted in a glove box filled with pure argon. 2.3 Characterization The crystal structures of the synthesized powders were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer with filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The experimental diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature by step scanning at the range of 10\u00b0 < 2 \u03b8 < 80\u00b0. The crystallite size was calculated based on the Scherrer equation from the study of the Bragg angle and half bandwidth of the index peaks. The mean value of crystallite sizes calculated based on [1 0 1], [1 1 1], [2 1 1] and [3 1 1] diffraction planes was adopted as the crystallite size of as-synthesized LiFePO 4 . The particulate morphology was examined by Environmental Scanning Electronic Microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). The specific surface area of the samples was characterized by N 2 adsorption at the temperature of liquid nitrogen using a BELSORP II instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were put in vacuum at 200 \u00b0C for 3\u20135 h to remove the surface adsorbed species. Thermogravimetry\u2013differential scanning calorimetric analyses (TG\u2013DSC) were performed using a NETZSCH STA 409 PC in the range of 25\u20131000 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min under flowing argon atmosphere. Temperature programmed reaction (TPR) experiments were conducted using a U-type quartz reactor. About 0.02 g sample in 40\u201360 mesh was dropped into a quartz tube reactor and a constant helium flow at 20 ml/min [STP] was introduced. The temperature of the reactor was programmatically increased. The effluent gas from the reactor was introduced to a mass spectroscope (QIC 20) for in situ compositional analysis. Before the electrochemical performance test, the cells were activated through one charge/discharge cycles with a small current (0.1C, 1C = 170 mAh/g) using a NEWARE BTS-5V50mA computer-controlled battery test system. The charge/discharge characteristics of the cells were recorded over the potential range between 2.0 and 4.2 V at different range of 0.1\u201350C at 30 \u00b0C. Cyclic voltammetry tests were performed over the potential range of 2.0\u20134.2 V using a Princeton Applied Research PARSTAT 2273 advanced electrochemical system at the scanning rate 0.1\u20131 mV/s. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis The reactants, a physical mixture of stoichiometric amounts of NH 4 H 2 PO 4 , Li 2 CO 3 , FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O and C 12 O 11 H 22 , demonstrated the color of light yellow, a typical color of FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O. It changed steadily to light green with increasing ball milling time during the mechanical activation. This implies that certain type of interaction between the reactants appeared during the high-energy ball milling. It is well known that Fe(H 2 O) 6 2+ has a color of light blue. Hereby, the ball milling likely led to the interaction of the hydroxide groups in sucrose with FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the precursor after the ball milling at room temperature for various hours. Before ball milling, the characteristic diffraction peaks of FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O were detected. However, an amorphous structure at room temperature was observed when the precursor was ball milled for 2 h or longer. This implies that the crystallite phase of the FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O was destroyed by reaction or certain type of interaction between FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O and other reactants existed after the ball milling, in accordance with the color change after the ball milling. During the thermal treatment, the cracking of sucrose and the phase reaction among NH 4 H 2 PO 4 , Li 2 CO 3 and FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O to form LiFePO 4 could happen simultaneously or separately. Different formation mechanism may result in significantly different anode morphology or phase structure, consequently, differed electrochemical behavior. The thermal decomposition behavior of sucrose was first investigated. As shown in Fig. 2 is the TG\u2013DSC curves of sucrose under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The weight loss started at \u223c215 \u00b0C, mainly happened between 220 and 400 \u00b0C, and finished around 700 \u00b0C. The final weight loss reached 84%. The DSC curve showed a sharp endothermic peak around 194 \u00b0C corresponding to a zero weight loss, which was assigned to the cleavage of glucose ring in sucrose. Another endothermic peak was observed around 230 \u00b0C accompanied with a sharp weight loss in the TG profile. There were two small successive endothermic peaks at 296 and 450 \u00b0C, respectively. The appearance of several successive endothermic peaks in the DSC profile suggests that the thermal cracking was conducted in several successive steps. For the thermal decomposition of sucrose, a theoretical weight loss 58% should be expected if carbon and water were the sole products. The actual weight loss 84% implies that only 38% carbon in sucrose was successfully converted to solid carbon. On other words, \u223c62% carbon was lost in the form of gaseous products, i.e., CO and CO 2 . The overall thermal decomposition reaction of sucrose could be expressed as C 12 O 11 H 22 \u2192 4.56C + 7.44(CO/CO 2 ) + 11(H 2 O/H 2 ). If assuming decomposition behavior of sucrose in the solid precursor was similar to pure sucrose, the actual carbon content in the derived LiFePO 4 /C composite is only around 2.3 wt.%. To further exploit the thermal decomposition reaction of sucrose, a TPR was conducted. As shown in Fig. 3 , there was almost no any gaseous species produced at T < 220 \u00b0C, agreed well with the TG\u2013DSC results. A broad water peak and a CO 2 peak were observed within the temperature range of 220\u2013550 \u00b0C, and 250\u2013500 \u00b0C, respectively. A CO peak was also appeared alongside with the CO 2 peak. At T > 550 \u00b0C, a large and broad H 2 peak was appeared, however, no other peak was detected in the same temperature zone. Since carbon is the only final solid residual, the hydrogen was then produced from the thermal decomposition of CH x . Above results demonstrated that the sucrose first cracked to CH x intermediate during the thermal decomposition, which was further converted to carbon at relatively high temperature of >550 \u00b0C. To exploit the role of the high-energy ball milling in the phase formation and its effect on the thermal decomposition behavior of the solid precursor, TG\u2013DSC and TPR of the solid precursors with and without the ball milling process were conducted. As shown in Fig. 4 , without the ball milling process, the weight loss started at 162 \u00b0C. A sharp weight loss appeared between 162 and 230 \u00b0C, which accounted for a weight loss of about 25%. Another obvious weight loss amounting to \u223c20% of initial weight appeared between 230 and 420 \u00b0C. Between 420 and 800 \u00b0C and mainly between 550 and 650 \u00b0C there was additional modest weight loss amounting to \u223c6%. The ball-milled precursor showed somewhat different decomposition behavior. One significant difference is that the weight loss initiated at room temperature. In combination with the color change after the ball milling, such weight loss was attributed to the evaporation of dehydrated water from FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O, created during the high-energy ball milling process. Another significant difference is that the sharp weight loss between 550 and 650 \u00b0C was disappeared. As shown in Fig. 5 , for the precursor without the ball milling process, there were almost no gaseous decomposition products at T < 180 \u00b0C, however, a big water peak was observed between 60 and 130 \u00b0C for the ball-milled sample. Such different behaviors are in well agreement with the TG\u2013DSC results. It further supported that the hydrated water in FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O was released during the high-energy ball milling process. Starting at around 180 \u00b0C and happening mainly between 180 and 380 \u00b0C, a strong and broad water peak was appeared for the solid precursor without the ball milling process, which was ascribed to the thermal decomposition of sucrose and the dehydration of FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O. Between 220 and 260 \u00b0C, CO and CO 2 decomposition peaks with similar intensity were appeared simultaneously. In connection with the thermal decomposition behavior of the sucrose, they were ascribed to the thermal decomposition of sucrose via the reaction C 12 O 11 H 22 \u2192 CH x + CO + CO 2 + H 2 O. As compared to pure sucrose, the CO and CO 2 decomposition peaks become sharper and moved to a lower temperature zone. It suggests that the formation of solid mixture facilitated the thermal decomposition of sucrose. Ammonia peak, attributed to the thermal decomposition of NH 4 H 2 PO 4 to NH 3 and H 3 PO 4 , was detected between 160 and 500 \u00b0C. Between 380 and 430 \u00b0C, sharp peaks of CO and CO 2 with similar intensity appeared simultaneously, which were attributed to the thermal decomposition of FeC 2 O 4 via the reaction FeC 2 O 4 \u2192 FeO + CO + CO 2 . A big and broad hydrogen peak was also observed in the same temperature zone, which was ascribed to the thermal dehydrogenation of CH x to C and H 2 . Between 600 and 700 \u00b0C, hydrogen, CO and CO 2 peaks with low intensity were appeared simultaneously, which were assigned to the thermal decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 to Li 2 O and CO 2 , and the reaction of CO 2 with CH x to form CO and H 2 , and so on, via the reactions as follows. Li 2 CO 3 \u2192 Li 2 O + CO 2 Li 2 O + FeHPO 4 \u2192 LiFePO 4 + H 2 O H 2 O + CH x \u2192 CO + H 2 CO 2 + CH x \u2192 CO + H 2 When the solid precursor was subjected for high-energy ball milling, the reactants were mixed thoroughly and had close contact. The ball milling process also led to the dehydration of FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O with the formation of free water as demonstrated previously. Such free water can be easily evaporated. It then well explained the observation of the water peak between 60 and 150 \u00b0C for the ball-milled sample. Starting at 180 \u00b0C, additional water desorption peak appeared, which was produced from the thermal decomposition of sucrose. Two small ammonia peaks were observed between 50 and 180 \u00b0C, while they were not detected for the solid precursor without the ball milling process during the synthesis. It suggests that the high-energy ball milling also facilitated the thermal decomposition of NH 4 H 2 PO 4 . Between 180 and 400 \u00b0C, relatively broad ammonia peak alongside with the CO 2 and CO peaks appeared. The CO 2 peak was found to have much stronger intensity than CO, different from the decomposition behavior of the precursor without the ball milling process. It was attributed to the thermal decomposition of sucrose alongside with the reaction of NH 4 H 2 PO 4 and Li 2 CO 3 (Li 2 CO 3 + NH 4 H 2 PO 4 \u2192 LiH 2 PO 4 + CO 2 ), facilitated by the high-energy ball milling. Between 400 and 450 \u00b0C, sharp CO and CO 2 peaks with similar densities appeared, which were ascribed to the thermal decomposition of FeC 2 O 4 to FeO, CO and CO 2 . At T > 500 \u00b0C, a broad hydrogen peak was also appeared without the formation of other decomposition product, in connection with the thermal decomposition behavior of sucrose, it was assigned to the decomposition of CH x . Based on the TG\u2013DSC and TPR results, a calcination temperature of around 700 \u00b0C was necessary in order to achieve the complete reaction of the reactants in the solid precursor without the ball milling process, while a similar temperature was required for the ball-milled precursor allowing the CH x completely decomposed to carbon. Thereby, 700 \u00b0C was selected for the thermal treatment of solid precursors. As shown in Fig. 6 are the XRD of the as-prepared LiFePO 4 /C composites by solid-state reaction at 700 \u00b0C for 20 h with or without the mechanical activation process, and LiFePO 4 synthesized without the high-energy ball milling process and without sucrose adopted during the synthesis. All three samples showed a well-crystalline single-phase LiFePO 4 . For each sample, all its diffraction peaks can be indexed well based on orthorhombic structure with the space group pnmb. No carbon diffraction peaks were detected for both LiFePO 4 /C composites with or without the ball milling process during the synthesis. This implies the formed carbon coating layer over LiFePO 4 surface was in an amorphous phase. 3.2 Electrochemical performance Fig. 7 shows the first charge/discharge profiles at 0.1C rate (current density of 17 mAh/g) for the samples of LiFePO 4 electrode prepared by solid-state reaction of NH 4 H 2 PO 4 , Li 2 CO 3 and FeC 2 O 4 \u00b72H 2 O at 700 \u00b0C for 20 h (sample I), LiFePO 4 /C composite prepared from the similar procedure of sample I but applying sucrose as carbon source during the synthesis (sample II), and LiFePO 4 /C composite prepared by the similar procedure of sample II with high-energy ball milling of the solid precursor for 2 h during the synthesis (sample III). The sample I showed the first discharge capacity around 110 mAh/g, similar to the literature result for a pure LiFePO 4 prepared by a similar solid-phase reaction process [36] . When sucrose was introduced as a carbon source during the preparation, the as-obtained LiFePO 4 /C composite showed a capacity around 140 mAh/g. It is generally believed that the carbon additive had several functions during the synthesis of LiFePO 4 . Besides its main function to improve the electronic conductivity by performing as surface coating layer, it also effectively prevents the oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ and acted as a diffusion block to suppress the LiFePO 4 grain growth. The measured BET surface area of samples I and II was 13.6 and 23.6 m 2 /g, respectively. It suggests that the sucrose indeed increased the surface area of the resulted LiFePO 4 . Both the increase in surface area and the improvement in electronic conductivity may account for the improved discharge capacity of LiFePO 4 /C composite as compared to conventional LiFePO 4 . When both high-energy ball milling (mechanical activation) and carbon additive were introduced during the synthesis of LiFePO 4 , the surface area further increased to 28.3 m 2 /g. The first discharge capacity increased obviously to 174 mAh/g, which reached the theoretical value for a LiFePO 4 cathode (170 mAh/g) Within experimental error. This implies all LiFePO 4 in the electrode became electrochemically active. The sample also demonstrated excellent reversible capacity around 97%. Thereby, the high-energy ball milling together with in situ carbon coating is highly effective to increase the electrochemical activity of LiFePO 4 cathode. As shown in Fig. 8 are the discharge curves of the LiFePO 4 /C composite at various discharge/charge rates varied from 0.1 to 50C. For accurate comparison of the rate performance during discharging, the cell was recharged at 0.1C rate to assure identical initial conditions for all the discharges [37,38] . The discharge capacities decreased from 171 mAh/g at 0.1C to 117 mAh/g at 20C. Even at 50C, a capacity of 81 mAh/g was still maintained, which is even higher than 76 mAh/g of the LiFePO 4 /C composite without the ball milling process during the synthesis at 5C rate. These results are among the best for LiFePO 4 /C composite electrode reported ever in literature. By a similar synthesis process Kim et al. reported a first discharge capacity of around 164 mAh/g at 0.1C rate and \u223c120 mAh/g at 1C rate [33] . The cycling characteristics of the as-prepared LiFePO 4 /C cathode material at different discharge rate are shown in Fig. 9 . Favorable cycle performance was demonstrated. At all discharge rates, the capacity fade after 50 cycles was less than 10%. The good long-term cycling behavior of the LiFePO 4 /C composite at various discharge rates confirms the excellent reversibility of lithium insertion/extraction reactions. Cyclic voltammograms of the LiFePO 4 /C electrode at the scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 mV/s between 4.2 and 2.0 V are shown in Fig. 10 a . The oxidizing peak and the reduction peak are highly symmetric to each other. The ratios of I pa / I pc are close to 1, implying that the good reversibility of lithium intercalation into and de-intercalation from the carbon-coated LiFePO4. There is a linear relationship between I pa and square root of the scan rate, as shown in Fig. 10 b. The slope k was found to be 1.446 \u00d7 10 \u22122 A s 0.5 /V 0.5 , where A is the current in Ampere, s is the time in second and V is the voltage. CV is a quasi-static electrode characterization technique. In an electrochemical process of LiFePO 4 /C electrode, the anodic process corresponds to the lithium-ion de-intercalation from LiFePO 4 bulk with the simultaneous diffusion of electron from the electrode to the current collector, while the cathodic process corresponds to the Li + intercalation into FePO 4 and acquiring electron from the current collector. Diffusion coefficient of lithium ions ( D o ) can be roughly estimated by cyclic voltammetry since the intercalation and de-intercalation is also a redox process. Under the condition of semi-infinite and infinite diffusion process, the peak current I p and the square root of scanning rate ( \u03bd ) has the relationship of Eq. (1) [39] . (1) I p = 2.69 \u00d7 10 5 S \u22c5 C o \u22c5 D o 1 / 2 \u22c5 n 2 / 3 \u22c5 \u03bd 1 / 2 where S is the total surface area of the anode material (cm 2 ), C o is the concentration of lithium ions in the cathode (mol/ml), D o is the average diffusion coefficient of lithium ion (cm 2 /s), n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule during the intercalation, it is 1 for LiFePO 4 , and \u03bd is the scanning rate (s \u22121 ).The surface area of the anode material can be calculated by (2) S = S m \u00d7 n o where S m is the mole surface area of anode (cm 2 /mol) and n o is the amount of the active material in the electrode (mol). If assuming the electrode material is in sphere shape, the mole surface area can be calculated by (3) S m = 3 V m r where V m is the mole volume of the electrode (ml/mol) and r is the radius of the particle (cm). The electrical charge Q transferred during charge/discharge process can be related with C o by (4) Q = n F V m \u00d7 C o Since I p is in linear relationship with n 1/2 with the slope of k , the lithium diffusion coefficient D o can be expressed by the following equation [40] : (5) D o = r 2 k 2 69.9 n 3 Q 2 The electrical charge that transferred through the active material during the charge/discharge process could be took as its capacity, which can also be calculated from the weight amount of the active material and the theoretical specific capacity. It can also be calculated from the discharge/charge curves or be obtained by integrating the CV curves with respect to time. Here, D o was calculated based on theoretical capacity, i.e., Q = 0.95C. As shown in Fig. 11 a is the SEM of the as-synthesized LiFePO 4 powder. It shows that LiFePO 4 had quasi-sphere shape with an average particle size of 1.5 \u03bcm, i.e. r = 7.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm. Together with the k value of 1.446 \u00d7 10 \u22122 A s 0.5 /V 0.5 , the lithium diffusion coefficient D o of \u223c8.93 \u00d7 10 \u221213 cm 2 /s was calculated according to Eq. (5) . The reported value for a pure LiFePO 4 is \u223c1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221214 cm 2 /s [41] . It then implies that the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient was greatly improved by applying sucrose as a carbon source in combination with high-energy ball milling, which may be the cause for the excellent high-rate performance of the LiFePO 4 /C composite prepared in this study. 3.3 Process optimization To exploit the effect of process parameter on the electrochemical performance of the derived LiFePO 4 , various ball milling times, thermal treatment temperatures and times were investigated in the synthesis of LiFePO 4 /C. As shown in Table 1 , the ball milling of 2\u20134 h resulted in the maximum surface area. The further increase in milling time, however, led to a steady decrease in surface area and increase in grain size. It is well known that the high-energy ball milling could result in a close contact of the reactants, which facilitated the solid-phase reaction, therefore reduced the sintering temperature and time for obtaining a pure phase LiFePO 4 . However, it can also break down the reactant particles and increase the surface activity. It means the particle sintering could be accelerated during the successive thermal treatment when the reactants were over ball milled. The thermal treatment temperature was found to have most significant impact on the surface area, the higher the calcination temperature the lower the surface area. As shown in Fig. 11 a\u2013c, the increase of calcination temperature resulted in obvious size growth of the particles. The calcination time also had an impact on the surface area, the longer the cacination the lower the surface area, as shown in Table 1 . The discharge capacities at various rates for the LiFePO 4 /C composites prepared at various conditions were then measured with the results also listed in Table 1 . The discharge capacity and rate performance of the as-prepared LiFePO 4 /C composite was found highly dependent on the process parameters. The best performance was achieved at a ball milling time of 2\u20134 h followed by heat treatment at 700 \u00b0C for 20 h. X-ray diffraction pattern demonstrated a pure phase LiFePO 4 was already formed for the 600 \u00b0C calcinated sample. SEM examination demonstrated it had a mean particle size of 0.5 \u03bcm, smaller than the 700 \u00b0C calcinated one of 1.5 \u03bcm ( Fig. 11 b). A smaller particle size means a shorter lithium diffusion distance, which is beneficial for high-rate discharge and charge processes. However, the capacities at both low and high discharge rates were reduced as compared to the 700 \u00b0C calcinated one. The poor electrochemical performance of the 600 \u00b0C calcinated sample was then contributed from the coating layer, which was likely in the state of CH x based on the TGA and TPR experiments. Since CH x has poor electronic conductivity it would have a serious block effect on the electronic transfer. The poor electrochemical performance of the 800 \u00b0C calcinated sample was attributed to its large grain size (around 2.2 \u03bcm), as shown in Fig. 11 c, due to the sintering. Relatively poor electrochemical performance was also observed for the LiFePO 4 /C composite calcinated at 700 \u00b0C for 15 h. It was likely that some of carbon in the coating layer was still in the form of CH x due to the insufficient calcination time. As shown in Table 1 , the ball milling time also had a significant impact on the discharge capacity and rate performance of the derived LiFePO 4 /C composite. The optimal ball milling time was 2\u20134 h. The further increase of ball milling time resulted in obvious decrease of capacity at both low and high discharge rates. It was believed that the over ball milling accelerated the LiFePO 4 sintering during the following high-temperature treatment. To summary, ball milling time, heat treatment temperature and time should be specifically optimized in order to achieve a high-performance LiFePO 4 /C composite synthesized by mechanical activation adopting sucrose as carbon source. 4 Conclusions Olivine-type LiFePO 4 /C composite was successfully synthesized by mechanical activation followed by thermal treatment. Ball milling time, thermal treatment temperature and time all have significant impact on the electrochemical performance of the derived LiFePO 4 /C composite. The high-energy ball milling facilitated the phase reaction between reactants and the thermal decomposition of sucrose. The sucrose was first cracked to CH x intermediate, which was then further converted to solid carbon at 700 \u00b0C or higher for a sufficient time. Too low calcination temperature for example 600 \u00b0C, and too short calcination time for example 15 h, resulted in the residual of undecomposed CH x , which seriously blocked the electron transfer and consequently decreased the electrochemical performance of LiFePO 4 /C composite. Over ball milling or over heating, however, resulted in grain growth of LiFePO 4 electrode during the following thermal treatment, a decrease in electrochemical performance was then experienced. Thereby, the process parameter should be optimized in order to obtain a high electrochemical performance. At a ball milling time of 2\u20134 h, thermal treatment at 700 \u00b0C for 20 h, the derived LiFePO 4 /C composite showed a discharge capacity of 174 mAh/g at 0.1C rate, it reached the theoretical value for LiFePO 4 within experimental error. It also showed a high-rate performance with a discharge capacity of 117 mAh/g at 20C rate. The performance of the derived LiFePO 4 /C composite, prepared by mechanical activation was very sensitive to the process parameters. Suppressing the grain growth and avoiding CH x are the keys to achieve high-rate performance LiFePO 4 /C composite cathode.

In this study, a tubular anode-supported thin-film YSZ electrolyte SOFC was successfully fabricated by extrusion of the anode substrate in combination with wet powder spraying of the electrolyte layer. The fuel cell performance was tested by applying either hydrogen or methane as the fuel and ambient air as the cathode atmosphere. Peak power densities of 432 and 145 mW cm -2 were achieved respectively at 800 and 600\u00b0C for a cell with conventional LSM and silver wire as the cathode and the current collector. The performance was further improved by adopting BSCF cathode with an SDC buffer layer. EIS demonstrated the large electrode polarization resistance is the main source of cell resistance, while the contact resistance is also not negligible. The performance of the cell directly operating on methane fuel was also investigated. A special operation mode by alternatively operating on methane and hydrogen fuels was adopted, which can effectively increase the cell operational stability. \u00a9 2012 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Y) was synthesized via an EDTA\u2013citrate complexing process. The particular Ln 3+ dopant had a significant effect on the oxide\u2019s phase structure/stability, oxygen content, electrical conductivity, oxygen permeability, and cathode performance. Stable, cation-ordered oxides with layered lattice structures were obtained with medium-sized Ln 3+ ions over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures, a property essential for applications as oxygen separation membranes and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes. PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 demonstrated the highest oxygen flux (\u223c5.09 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C), but this value was still significantly lower than that of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 perovskite (\u223c3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C). The observed difference was attributed to the much longer diffusion distance through a polycrystalline membrane with a layered lattice structure than through cubic perovskite because bulk diffusion was the rate-limiting step of permeation. An area-specific resistance of \u223c0.213 \u03a9 cm 2 was achieved at 600 \u00b0C with a PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 cathode, suggesting that the layer-structured oxides were promising alternatives to ceramic membranes for SOFC cathodes. Keywords LnBa 2 Co 2 O 5+ \u03b4 Mixed conductor Cation-ordered SOFC Ceramic membrane 1 Introduction Some solid oxides with defined molecular structures, like perovskite, demonstrate mixed ionic and electronic conductivity at elevated temperatures, and they are promising materials for applications in power-generating solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathodes or in dense ceramic membranes for oxygen separation [1,2] . These new technologies offer enormous economic and environmental benefits. In contrast to the traditional oxygen separation processes of cryogenic fractional distillation and pressure swing adsorption, this new membrane technology could be exploited to develop a new oxygen separation process that would allow for continuous operation and increased energy savings [3] . Furthermore, a ceramic oxygen membrane can be coupled to an oxidative reaction, such as partial oxidation of methane to syngas, allowing the two processes to be performed in a single step. This would greatly simplify reactor design, improve safety, increase the selectivity of product formation, and, most importantly, reduce operational costs [4\u20136] . In addition, SOFCs are much more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting chemical energy into usable work while simultaneously reducing CO 2 and pollutant emissions [7\u20139] . Dense ceramic membranes fabricated from these oxides are oxygen-permeable; oxygen ions can permeate from the oxygen-rich side, through the bulk of the material, to the oxygen-poor side. Electron countercurrents opposing the flow of oxygen ions maintain charge balance within the material. The mechanism of oxygen permeation through these membranes is outlined in Fig. 1 a. First, gas-phase molecular oxygen on the oxygen-rich side diffuses to the membrane surface where it is adsorbed. The adsorbed oxygen then withdraws two electrons form the membrane and dissociates into oxygen ions. Driven by the oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane, the oxygen ions diffuse across the membrane bulk to the membrane surface on the oxygen-poor side, where they recombine with electron holes to form adsorbed molecular and atomic oxygen. Finally, the molecular oxygen is desorbed into the gas phase on the oxygen-poor side. High-oxygen surface-exchange kinetics and a high rate of oxygen diffusion through the membrane bulk are, therefore, crucial to achieving superior oxygen fluxes through a membrane with a given thickness and a given transmembrane oxygen partial pressure gradient. The widespread commercialization of SOFCs requires both lowering cost and enhancing the cell stability, and finding suitable materials that operate efficiently at reduced temperatures (400\u2013700 \u00b0C) is one way of achieving these goals [10,11] . Most SOFC cathodes are fabricated from La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 perovskite, which is a strong electronic conductor [12] . During fuel cell operation, the reduction of oxygen is strictly limited to the electrode\u2013electrolyte\u2013gas triple phase boundary, and sharp increases in electrode polarization resistance are typically observed at lower operating temperatures. Applying a mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) oxide as an electrode should allow for the oxygen reduction sites to penetrate into the electrode bulk to a finite depth. The mechanism of oxygen activation at a MIEC cathode is depicted in Fig. 1 b. The pertinent reactions involve both oxygen surface exchange and bulk diffusion processes. As demonstrated by Adler et al., oxygen surface sorption and bulk diffusion limit the characteristic depth of oxygen reduction in porous MIEC electrodes [13] . To achieve high oxygen fluxes through ceramic membranes or efficient SOFC performance at reduced temperatures, MIEC materials with faster oxygen diffusion rates through the material bulk and improved surface exchange kinetics are of great importance. Substituted perovskite oxides have been the most thoroughly investigated oxides for these purposes. Specific compositions have demonstrated outstanding oxygen diffusion rates, favorable electronic conductivities, and good oxygen surface exchange kinetics [14\u201318] . Recently, however, perovskite-related oxides, LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = Y, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd) have received tremendous attention as potential alternative MIEC oxides. These materials possess an ordered structure in which lanthanide and alkali-earth ions occupy the A-site sub-lattice and oxygen vacancies are localized into layers [19\u201325] . The structures of these materials are compared with those of the perovskite oxides in Fig. 2 . The ideal structure of this family of compounds can be represented by the stacking sequence \u2026\u2223LnO \u03b4 \u2223CoO 2 \u2223BaO\u2223CoO 2 . Transformation of a simple cubic perovskite with randomly occupied A-sites into a layered crystal with alternating lanthanide and alkali-earth planes reduces the strength of oxygen binding and provides disorder-free channels for ionic motion, thereby theoretically increasing the oxygen diffusivity by many orders of magnitude [19] . Until now, most investigations of cation-ordered materials have focused on their magnetic properties at low temperatures [26\u201330] . Recently, however, they have also received attention for their potential application as SOFC cathodes [19\u201325] . Nevertheless, their performance as ceramic membranes has not yet been investigated experimentally. Furthermore, a systematic investigation of the effect of the Ln 3+ cation on the high-temperature properties of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 is also still lacking. In this study, experiments to determining the effect of the Ln 3+ cation on the properties of mixed conducting double perovskite, such as phase structure and stability, oxygen content, electrical conductivity, oxygen permeation, and cathodic performance, were conducted. 2 Experimental procedure 2.1 Synthesis and fabrication LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = La,Y, Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd) composite oxides were synthesized via combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol\u2013gel process [31,32] . Ba(NO 3 ) 2 , Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 x H 2 O and Ln(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b7 x H 2 O (all A.R. grade) served as the raw materials for the necessary metal ions. Separate 1 M solutions of the nitrates were prepared, and their precise concentrations were determined by titration with EDTA. From these solutions, solutions were prepared with molar ratios of total metal ions:EDTA:citric acid of 1:1:2, and their pH values were adjusted to \u223c6 with NH 3 \u00b7 H 2 O. The solutions were heated continuously at 90 \u00b0C until sufficient water had evaporated that a transparent purple gel was obtained. This gel was pre-fired at 250 \u00b0C and subsequently calcinated at various temperatures for 5 h under an air atmosphere to yield the desired oxide powder products. These oxide powders were pressed into disk-shaped pellets using a stainless steel mold (15.0 mm diameter) under approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 Pa hydraulic pressure. The resulting green disks were roughly 1.0 mm thick and were further sintered in an electrical box furnace at 1100\u20131150 \u00b0C for 2\u20135 h under an air atmosphere. During this time, the heating and cooling rates were controlled at 1\u20132 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The resulting sintered membranes had diameters of \u223c12 mm and relative densities measured by a liquid displacement technique with pure water acting as the medium. The relative densities and theoretical densities of the samples are given in Table 1 . Both faces of the membranes were polished with 1000 mesh SiC paper until the desired thickness was achieved. 2.2 Basic characterization The crystal structures of the metal oxide powders and the sintered membranes were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). An environmental scanning microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000) equipped with an energy disperse X-ray (EDX) attachment was used to measure the samples\u2019 surface morphologies. The stoichiometry of oxygen vacancies was measured with the iodometric titration technique [33] . Samples were dissolved in a solution of potassium iodide in HCl and heated in an oxygen-free environment. The iodide reduced any cobalt ions (Co 3+ , Co 4+ ) present to Co 2+ and was simultaneously oxidized to form I 2 . The amount of I 2 released was quantified via redox titration with thiosulfate, and the oxygen vacancy stoichiometry was then calculated based on the amount of I 2 formed. For oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O 2 -TPD) experiments, 0.05\u20130.1 g of oxide powder was deposited into a U-type quartz reactor with an inner diameter of \u223c3 mm. A K-type thermocouple was positioned near the powder to monitor and control sample temperature. High-purity helium (>99.999%) was fed into the reactor at a rate of 20 ml min \u22121 (STP, standard temperature and pressure). After circulating helium gas at room temperature for around 30 min to get rid of any weakly adsorbed species, the reactor was heated at 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 to a final temperature of 950 \u00b0C. As the adsorbed molecular oxygen was released from the oxide lattice during the heating, the helium carried the molecules to a mass spectrometer (Hiden QIC-20), which was coupled to the reactor outlet, for in situ analysis. For carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) experiment, the samples were first pretreated by CO 2 atmosphere at 800 \u00b0C for 5 h and quickly cooled down to room temperature under the same atmosphere. The helium sweep gas at 20 ml min \u22121 (STP) was then switched on. After blew away the residual CO 2 gas inside the reactor by the flowing helium for a couple of minutes, the temperature was increased from \u223c200 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 to 930 \u00b0C and dwelled until no more CO 2 released from the sample. The evolved CO 2 during the TPD process was in situ analyzed by a mass spectrometer (MS). The electrical conductivities of sintered bars with approximate dimensions of 2 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 12 mm were measured using a four-probe DC method. Measurements were performed under an air atmosphere while cooling from 900 to 300 \u00b0C at intervals of 5 \u00b0C. A constant current was applied to the two current wires. The voltage response of the two voltage wires was monitored using a Keithley 2420 Sourcemeter. Sufficient time (\u223c5 min) was allowed for the conductivity to reach its steady-state value. The current was increased from 1 \u03bcA to a maximum value of 2 A. Only data in the ohmic regime were used to calculate conductivity. 2.3 Oxygen permeation measurement Membrane permeability was assessed using a high-temperature oxygen permeation apparatus via the gas chromatography (GC) method [33] . A silver paste was used to fix the membrane disk onto a dense quartz tube. The effective exposed area on the sweep side was \u223c0.45 cm 2 . The membrane sidewall was also painted with the silver paste to avoid any radial contributions to the oxygen flux. Air was supplied to the oxygen-rich side of the membrane at a flow rate of 400 ml min \u22121 (STP), and helium was employed not only as a sweep gas to create an oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane but also as the carrier gas for transporting the permeated oxygen to a Varian GC equipped with a 5 \u00c5 capillary column and thermal conductivity detector for quantitative oxygen concentration analysis. The oxygen permeation flux was calculated using the following formula: (1) J O 2 ( mol cm - 2 s - 1 ) = C O 2 - C N 2 \u00d7 0.21 0.79 \u00d7 28 32 1 / 2 \u00d7 F S , where C O and C N are the measured gas-phase concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen, respectively, on the sweep side (mol ml \u22121 ), F is the flow rate of the exit gas on the sweep side (ml s \u22121 ), and S is the geometric surface area of the membrane on the sweep side (cm 2 ). 2.4 Electrochemical characterization Electrochemical characterization was conducted using a symmetric cell configuration. Electrolyte disks were fabricated from Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 (SDC) powder via die-pressing and were subsequently sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. The average thickness and diameter of the sintered electrolyte disks were approximately 1.0 and 13 mm, respectively. Cathode slurry was sprayed onto each side of the electrolyte substrate as symmetrically as possible, and the substrate was then calcinated at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The area-specific polarization resistance of the cathode under an air atmosphere was determined from its electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat/galvanostat. The frequency range of EIS measurement was from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, and the signal amplitude was 10 mV. Data were collected with ZPlot 2.9c software. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase and oxygen nonstoichiometric properties Oxides were prepared from the appropriate chemical precursors via calcination at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere, and the oxide\u2019s XRD patterns were acquired ( Fig. 3 ). Samples with the nominal compositions of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 (Ln = Y, Pr, Nd, Sm or Gd) were pure-phase oxides with orthorhombic lattice geometry of space group Pmmm, and these findings were in agreement with previously published reports [26,34,35] . These structures resembled that of simple cubic perovskite-type Ln 1\u2212 x Ba x CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 , but the distributions of rare-earth and alkali-earth ions were stratified into individual layers instead of being randomly intermixed [36] . The measured difference in diffraction angle (2 \u03b8 ) between the peaks corresponding to the (1 2 0) and (1 0 2) planes was steadily reduced as the radius of the Ln 3+ ion was increased, suggesting that the difference in bond length between Ba\u2013O and Ln\u2013O bonds was reduced with increasing Ln 3+ cation size. Furthermore, steady increases in ionic radius shifted the diffraction peaks to lower values of 2 \u03b8 , and the Ln 3+ ions were ranked in descending order according to the reverse shift in 2 \u03b8 as follows (radius of Ln 3+ in 8-coordination with oxygen is also given in parentheses): Pr 3+ (1.13 \u00c5), Nd 3+ (1.11 \u00c5), Sm 3+ (1.08 \u00c5), Gd 3+ (1.05 \u00c5), and Y 3+ (1.02 \u00c5). This trend in the diffraction patterns was indicative of unit cell contractions. Finally, impure phases were observed for LaBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 , suggesting that the La 3+ dopant was, in fact, over-sized. The complete list of relevant lattice parameters is given in Table 2 . If these oxide materials are applied in oxygen separation membranes for solid-oxide fuel cells, then they will be subjected to an oxygen partial pressure gradient during operation. Typically, one side of the membrane is exposed to either air or compressed air and the other side is exposed to a steady flow of an inert carrier gas. Although an SOFC cathode is usually exposed to air, the oxygen partial pressure at its surface could be much lower than that of the surrounding environment during current-induced polarization. The oxide phase structure must be stable under operation conditions to ensure a high trans-membrane oxygen permeation flux or a stable cathode performance. For example, under a cathodic polarization potential of \u223c0.2 V, the local partial pressure of oxygen at the cathode surface is \u223c5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 atm at 600 \u00b0C when air is used as the cathodic atmosphere. This value is nearly the same as that present in a high-purity sample of inert gas. The structural stability of the oxides under realistic oxygen separation conditions was investigated by annealing the materials at 850 \u00b0C under an atmosphere of air, pure oxygen, or pure nitrogen for an extended period (100 h). The samples were then examined using XRD techniques ( Fig. 4 ). A phase transition was observed for the LaBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 and YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides under a reducing nitrogen atmosphere. In addition, impure phases also appeared in the YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 sample under an oxidizing oxygen atmosphere. For the other oxide formulations, the double perovskite structure was stable under all atmospheres tested, suggesting that the size of the dopant Ln 3+ cation was essential for a stable, layered crystalline structure. It has been previously demonstrated that the phase structures of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides are dependent upon the oxygen contents of their LnO \u03b4 layers [25] . In agreement with these observations, various superstructures, which resulted from the ordering of oxygen vacancies in the LnO \u03b4 layer, were observed in the YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 samples [37] . The iodometic titration method was employed to assess the precise value of \u03b4 at room temperature for the various samples annealed under atmospheres of air, oxygen, or nitrogen ( Table 3 ). The value of \u03b4 declined both when the partial pressure of oxygen during annealing was decreased and when the Ln 3+ ionic radius was decreased. Furthermore, increasing the Ln 3+ cationic radii also resulted in higher nominal oxidation states for the cobalt ions. Taskin et al. noted that the concentration of oxygen in an LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxide was very sensitive to the size of the lanthanide; those containing larger Ln 3+ ions possessed a greater number of oxygen atoms within their LnO \u03b4 planes [38] . Our results confirmed these observations ( Table 3 ). Low oxygen content in the LnO \u03b4 layer may have partly accounted for the poor stability of YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 under a nitrogen atmosphere (see Table 3 ). 3.2 Oxygen desorption properties and carbon dioxide sensitivity It is generally believed that pervasive cationic ordering at the crystal lattice A-site facilitates oxygen diffusion through the LnO \u03b4 layer of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides [19] . Experiments employing TGA, electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, and oxygen\u2013isotope exchange/depth profiling techniques have corroborated the validity of this hypothesis [19,21,23,25] . In the present work, an O 2 -TPD technique was adopted to further investigate the oxygen diffusivity properties of such oxides. With the programmed increase in sample temperature, the reduction of metal ions from higher to lower oxidation states occurs simultaneously alongside the creation of oxygen vacancies in the oxide bulk and the release of oxygen from the lattice. For cobalt-based perovskite-related oxides, the oxygen desorption \u03b1-peak (200\u2013600 \u00b0C) is typically associated with the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ , while the \u03b2-peak (>800 \u00b0C) is usually related to the reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ [39] . The initial temperature of oxygen desorption ( T i ) and the peak temperature ( T p ) were determined from the oxygen surface-exchange kinetics and oxygen diffusion rate through the bulk, the particle size of the powder, and the heating rate. The peak intensity was closely related to the variability of cobalt oxidation state within the oxides. To minimize the effect of particle morphology on oxygen desorption behavior, the different oxides were prepared in a manner that was as consistent as possible. Thus, all the samples were synthesized using the same EDTA\u2013citrate complexing technique and were calcinated under identical conditions, 950 \u00b0C for 5 h under an air atmosphere. SEM imaging showed that all of the samples possessed similar particle morphologies with mean particle sizes of 1 \u03bcm regardless of their specific Ln 3+ dopants ( Fig. 5 ). The O 2 -TPD profiles of the various LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides were compared to the oxygen desorption curve for BSCF ( Fig. 6 ). Similar to BSCF, two desorption peaks were observed for the LaBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 , PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 and NdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 samples. In accordance with literature precedent, the first desorption peak was ascribed to the de-intercalation of oxygen from the LnO \u03b4 plane that is typically associated with the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ . The T i and T p values for the \u03b1-oxygen desorption were 219 and 421 \u00b0C, respectively, for PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 , while the corresponding values were 311 and 437 \u00b0C, respectively, for BSCF perovskite (see Table 4 ). This indicated that the double-layered perovskite structure facilitated oxygen de-intercalation from the lattice, so these results agree with those of previous experiments employing TGA and electrical relaxation techniques [19,23] . As the size of the Ln 3+ cation was decreased, the T i and T p of \u03b1 -oxygen desorption both shifted to higher temperatures, suggesting that oxygen mobility within the LnO \u03b4 plane had been reduced. Such a trend was attributed to the increased columbic attraction between Ln 3+ and O 2\u2212 ions. The reduced peak intensity of \u03b2-oxygen desorption with decreases in Ln 3+ cation size (from Ln = Pr to Gd) suggested that this change suppressed the thermal reduction of Co 3+ to Co 2+ . Interestingly, two consecutive peaks appeared in the low-temperature ranges of spectra corresponding to the SmBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 and GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 samples, implying that oxygen desorption might also occur in the CoO 2 planes. Four successive desorption peaks appeared in the \u03b1-zone of the YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 spectrum that were presumably connected to the collapse of the double-layered perovskite structure following the O 2 -TPD experiment and the phase transition during the O 2 desorption process. In addition, the instability of perovskite containing alkaline-earth elements in the presence of CO 2 emerged as one of the limiting factors for their application. Therefore, it is important to check whether LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides are also sensitive to CO 2 pickup. CO 2 -TPD can provide effective information on the behavior of CO 2 over these materials. As shown in Fig. 7 , The CO 2 -TPD profiles of the various LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides were compared to the CO 2 desorption curve for BSCF. The obvious CO 2 desorption peaks were observed for all LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 samples. The peak intensity of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 samples, which represented the amount of CO 2 adsorbed, were relatively small as compared to that of BSCF. This result indicated that the interaction between CO 2 and LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 was depressed on a certain extent. It is likely that the slow diffusion of Ba 2+ in the Ba\u2013O plane inhibited carbonate formed over the powder surface, owing to the double-layered perovskite structure. 3.3 Electrical conductivity High electrical conductivity is one fundamental requirement for MIEC materials used either as electrodes for SOFCs or as oxygen permeation membranes. There are two primary conduction mechanisms relevant to these oxides, electronic and ionic conduction, as a result of the simultaneous presence of both electronic holes and oxygen vacancies within these materials. The total conductivity of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 materials under air and nitrogen atmospheres was measured using a four-probe DC method ( Fig. 8 ). Because ionic conductivity is much lower than electronic conductivity, the values reported herein were assumed to be attributable to electronic conductivity alone. The maximal conductivity of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 was 120\u2013350 S cm \u22121 , which was reached under an air atmosphere and which was highly dependent on the Ln 3+ dopant. Conductivity values initially increased with increasing Ln 3+ cation size and the reached a maximum value before declining. The two highest conductivies observed under an air atmosphere were attributable to SmBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 followed by NdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 . Electronic conduction within perovskite-related oxides is believed to occur via electron hopping along B\u2013O\u2013B bonds. The exact mechanism is thought to resemble a Zerner double exchange process, which is closely related to both the mobility of the electrical carriers and the path of diffusion. As the O 2 -TPD experiments demonstrated, increasing the ionic radius of the Ln 3+ cation facilitated the reduction of Co 4+ to Co 3+ . These results were also used to explain the following conductivity ranking: YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 < GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 < SmBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 . Nevertheless, the degree of overlap between the electron clouds of the oxygen and cobalt ions also affects a material\u2019s conductivity. Generally, increasing B\u2013O\u2013B bond lengths in cobalt-containing perovskites leads to decreased electron delocalization and to more difficult direct electron hopping between Co 4+ and Co 3+ centers [40] . Consequently, further increases in Ln 3+ ionic radius should decrease the electrical conductivity such that SmBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 > NdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 > PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 > LaBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 . Within the 20\u2013900 \u00b0C temperature range, LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides demonstrated predominately metal-like conductivities when exposed to an air atmosphere. The observed increase in electrical conductivity with increases in oxygen partial pressure, Fig. 8 suggested P-type electron conduction, in which electrons hopped between Co 3+ and Co 4+ . This agreed well with previous results, indicating a nominal cobalt ion oxidation state greater than 3+ in most LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides that were investigated. The conductivity tended to drop suddenly as the temperature was decreased to \u223c150 \u00b0C under an air atmosphere, suggesting a transition to insulator\u2013metal behavior [26] . Under the low oxygen partial pressure of a pure nitrogen atmosphere, all LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides exhibited relatively high electrical conductivity and reached maximal conductivities from 50 to 100 S cm \u22121 . Generally, decreasing the partial pressure of oxygen and increasing the operating temperature decreased the materials\u2019 electrical conductivities due to the creation of oxygen vacancies. Such lattice defects broke the B\u2013O\u2013B bonds and resulted in obvious decreases in electronic conductivity [41] . As a result of the layered structure of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides, oxygen release usually occurred in the LnO \u03b4 plane. For many materials, no oxygen vacancies were created in the CoO 2 plane, thus ensuring a contiguous path of B\u2013O\u2013B bonds for electron transport processes. This explained the high electron conductivities of the LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides examined in low-oxygen environments. 3.4 Oxygen permeation properties The potential application of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides as materials for constructing ceramic oxygen separation membranes was also investigated. There is no existence of open pores observed form the SEM micrographs. All of the samples possessed similar morphologies with mean grain size of 5 \u03bcm ( Fig. 9 ). The temperature dependence of the oxygen permeation flux through 0.7 mm thick membranes was measured for a variety of Ln 3+ -doped oxides ( Fig. 10 ). Ambient air was used as a feed gas to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen at 0.21 atm on the oxygen-rich side of the membrane, and a helium carrier gas was pumped across the opposing side of the membrane at a constant flow rate of 100 ml min \u22121 (STP) to create an oxygen partial pressure gradient across the membrane. For the YBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membrane, zero oxygen permeability was detected within the limits of experimental error at temperatures between 700 and 900 \u00b0C. A similarly low permeability was also observed for the LaBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membrane at 900 \u00b0C (0.625 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 ) that quickly decayed to zero as the temperature was lowered to 825 \u00b0C. Such poor oxygen permeability was attributed to the poor stability of the oxides\u2019 layered structures, as measured during XRD experiments. Under identical operating conditions, the oxygen flux through the LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membrane increased as the Ln 3+ ionic radius was increased such that the permeabilities were ranked as follows: PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 > NdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 > SmBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 > GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 . This ranking was identical to that of oxygen mobility within the LnO \u03b4 layer, suggesting that the rate of oxygen diffusion within the membrane bulk may be rate-limiting for the passage of oxygen through thick LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membranes. The highest permeation flux of \u223c5.09 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 at 900 \u00b0C was achieved using a membrane composed of PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 . The dependence of the oxygen flux through a PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membrane on the membrane thickness ( Fig. 11 ) supported the aforementioned hypothesis regarding the rate-limiting step of oxygen transport. Reducing the membrane thickness was predicted to increase the trans-membrane oxygen flux ( Fig. 11 b), and these two quantities were roughly inversely proportional between 700 and 900 \u00b0C. This strongly indicates that the rate of diffusion with the bulk was controlling the overall rate of oxygen permeation. Although the oxygen flux across PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membranes at high temperatures were higher than those across other layered oxides, such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 [42] , the values were still much lower than that across a BSCF membrane, the membrane with the highest oxygen permeability. A maximal permeation flux of \u223c3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol cm \u22122 s was achieved at 900 \u00b0C using a 0.7 mm thick BSCF membrane under similar conditions, and this value was almost 6 times that of the PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membrane tested in this study. Since PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides have been reported to possess superior oxygen diffusion rates and faster surface exchange kinetics than those of A-site cation-disordered perovskite-oxide-related oxides, these findings were somewhat peculiar. To explain this discrepancy, it was necessary to determine the membranes\u2019 oxygen ionic conductivities. For the ceramic MIEC membranes, when diffusion of oxygen through the membrane bulk controls the rate of permeation, the permeation flux can be expressed using the Wanger equation as follows: (2) J O 2 = - RT 4 2 F 2 L \u222b ln P O 2 \u2032 ln P O 2 \u2033 t ion t el \u03b4 total d ln P O 2 , where F is Faraday\u2019s constant, L is the membrane thickness, t ion is the ionic transference number, t el is the electronic transference number, \u03c3 total is the sum of ionic and electronic conductivities, and P O 2 \u2032 and P O 2 \u2033 are the equivalent partial pressures of oxygen on the feed side and sweep side, respectively. Because the ionic conductivity of oxygen seldom exceeded 1 S cm \u22121 , and the total conductivity of PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 was greater than 30 S cm \u22121 even under a reducing nitrogen atmosphere between 700 and 900 \u00b0C ( Fig. 11 b), Eq. (2) was simplified in the following manner: (3) J O 2 = - RT 4 2 F 2 L \u222b ln P O 2 \u2032 ln P O 2 \u2033 \u03b4 ion d [ ln P O 2 ] . The average oxygen ionic conductivity can then be calculated using the following expression: (4) \u03c3 ave = J O 2 4 2 F 2 L RT ln P O 2 \u2032 P O 2 \u2033 - 1 . The temperature dependence of nominal ionic conductivity was measured for the various LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides ( Fig. 12 ). For PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 , values of 0.011, 0.028, 0.048, 0.073, and 0.099 S cm \u22121 were achieved at 700, 750, 800, 850, and 900 \u00b0C, respectively. Based on oxygen flux measurements, the nominal oxygen ionic conductivity of BSCF at 900 \u00b0C was found to be greater than 1.4 S cm \u22121 [43] , suggesting that the ionic conductivity of PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 was much smaller than that of BSCF. Based on TGA and electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, the oxygen ionic conductivity of GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 was reported to be as high as 0.01 S cm \u22121 at 500 \u00b0C [19] , so PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 possesses even greater ionic conductivity than GdBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 [23] . From linear extrapolation of the ionic conductivity curve ( Fig. 12 ), the ionic conductivity was calculated to be 0.0016 S cm \u22121 , a value 6.3 times lower than the anticipated value, 0.01 S cm \u22121 . This suggested that different methods could produce divergent nominal ionic conductivity measurements. Ceramic membranes are typically composed of polycrystalline oxides. For membranes composed of perovskite oxide with cubic phase structures, the distribution of oxygen vacancies within the lattice is disordered, and oxygen can diffuse freely within the lattice. Thus, variations in microstructure have less effect on oxygen transport through the membrane. In contrast, in A-site cation-ordered LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides, it has been demonstrated that oxygen diffusion is restricted within the LnO \u03b4 plane and that oxygen diffusion through the CoO 2 plane or in a direction perpendicular to the LnO \u03b4 plane is negligible. This implies that changes in the polycrystalline membrane microstructure could result in significant changes in the oxygen diffusion path. The oxygen transport path within the polycrystalline oxide membrane was more distorted than that of the single-crystal membrane because the individual crystals composing the polycrystalline oxide were randomly oriented ( Fig. 13 ). The actual oxygen diffusion distance could be much longer than just the membrane thickness, the distance used in calculation of the material\u2019s ionic conductivity. This may have explained the lower-than-expected oxygen ionic conductivity calculated from measurements of transmembrane oxygen flux. 3.5 Cathode performance Considering the outstanding oxygen surface-exchange kinetics of A-site cation-ordered oxides, these materials are perhaps best applied either as surface coatings for ceramic oxygen separation membranes or as reduced temperature solid-oxide fuel cell cathodes. For such applications, the oxide layers are limited to being tens of microns thick. Consequently, the reduction of adsorbed oxygen plays a much larger role in determining the polarization resistance when the diffusion distance is much shorter (i.e., tens of microns) rather than longer (i.e., hundreds to thousands of microns). The performance of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 as an SOFC cathode was assessed at intermediate temperatures. A symmetric cell configuration was used with SDC serving as the electrolyte. The area-specific polarization resistance (ASR) of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 between 500 and 700 \u00b0C was measured for each of the various Ln 3+ dopants ( Fig. 14 ). Among the oxides examined, PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 performed best. The area-specific polarization resistance of this material at 600 \u00b0C was \u223c0.213 \u03a9 cm 2 , a value very similar to that reported by Jacobson et al. [23] for PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 + GDC composite cathodes. For the purposes of comparison, the ASRs of BSCF is \u223c0.1 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C under similar operation conditions ( Fig. 14 ). Thus, the performance characteristics of LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides are very attractive because they suggest serious potential for application of these materials as IT-SOFC cathodes. The differences between PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 and BSCF in terms of their polarization resistances was much smaller than their differences in terms of transmembrane oxygen flux (a factor of 2.1 versus a factor of \u223c6), thereby supporting the hypothesis that layer-structured oxides would be more successful if applied to fabricate cathodes rather than to fabricate ceramic membranes. The performance of the individual LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides was ranked as follows: Pr 3+ > Gd 3+ > Nd 3+ > Sm 3+ > La 3+ > Y 3+ . This ranking mirrored the aforementioned oxygen permeation assessment. The Y 3+ - and La 3+ -doped samples demonstrated the poorest performance, which coincided with the instability of the layered structures within these materials as determined from XRD studies ( Fig. 4 ). 4 Conclusions LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides were synthesized using an EDTA-citrate complexing process at relatively low calcination temperatures. The stabilities of the double-layered perovskite structure of the LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides were closely related to the ionic radius of the Ln 3+ cation. Stable layered structure was observed for Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd, while layer structure was in a metastable state for Ln = Y and La. Increasing the ionic radius of the Ln 3+ cation increased oxygen content and the nominal oxidation state of the cobalt ions in the oxide. In addition, larger ionic radii for the Ln 3+ cation translated into higher the oxygen mobility in the LnO \u03b4 layer. Ceramic membranes fabricated from LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 demonstrated moderate oxygen permeation fluxes. While PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membranes demonstrated the highest fluxes, these values were still much lower than those of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 membranes, which are cubic perovskite lattice structures and have the highest measured oxygen permeability. The rate of oxygen diffusion through thick PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 membrane bulk was slow, so oxygen permeation was rate-limiting. This was attributed to the oxides\u2019 polycrystalline structure and to the fact that oxygen diffusion was limited to the LnO \u03b4 layers only. Attractive high electrode performance, however, was observed for LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 , especially PrBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 , which possessed an area-specific polarization resistance of \u223c0.213 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C. These results were attributed to the fast exchange kinetics across the oxides\u2019 surfaces, and they suggest that these layer-structured LnBaCo 2 O 5+ \u03b4 oxides might be best applied as materials for reduced-temperature solid-oxide fuel cell electrodes rather than as materials for ceramic oxygen-separation membranes.

Peak power densities of \u223c420 and 135 mW/cm 2 were achieved, respectively, at 700 and 450 \u00b0C for a cell with 35 \u03bcm thick electrolyte operating on hydrogen fuel. The endothermic nature of the ammonia decomposition reaction, however, resulted in cell temperature 30\u201365 \u00b0C lower than the furnace when operating on ammonia. Accounting the cooling effect, comparable power density was achieved for the cell operating on ammonia and hydrogen at high temperature. At reduced temperature, the cell demonstrated worse performance when operating on ammonia than on hydrogen due to the poor activity of the anode towards NH 3 catalytic decomposition. By applying on-line catalytic decomposition products of N 2 H 4 as the fuel, similar cell performance to that with NH 3 fuel was also observed. Keywords BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Solid-oxide fuel cells Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 Ammonia hydrazine 1 Introduction Fuel cells, reputed for their high efficiency and low environmental impact, represent an attractive technology for converting fuel directly into electricity [1] . Proton-conducting perovskite-type oxides have received increasing attention as electrolytes of reduced temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC\u2013H + ) since the pioneering work of Iwahara et\u00a0al. [2] . Selected oxides have shown higher conductivity than many oxygen-ionic conducting electrolytes at temperature lower than 600 \u00b0C [3,4] . Furthermore, SOFC\u2013H + leads to the production of water vapor at the cathode side, which helps to improve the electrical motive force and the conversion efficiency of SOFC system [5] . Although its high conductivity, many research works have demonstrated that BaCe 0.9 Y 0.1 O 2.95 (BCY) can react with CO 2 [6] . Recently Zou et\u00a0al. reported that the resistance of the oxide towards CO 2 induced decomposition was greatly suppressed while the high conductivity was still maintained by partial substitution of Ce 4+ in BaCe 1y Y y O 3\u2212 \u03b4 with Zr 4+ at proper amount, specifically with the composition of BaCe 0.7 Zr 0.1 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BCZY) [3,7] . As an eligible fuel for SOFCs, it is supposed to be cheap, safe and pollution-free, have no electrode contamination, and be easy to store and transport. Ammonia is produced in high quantities, mostly used as raw material for the production of artificial fertilizer and nitric acid. Recently, ammonia as the potential fuel of fuel cell has been recognized [8] . On the other hand, hydrazine is in liquid state at room temperature and ambient pressure; it can be treated as the carrier of NH 3 . By applying ammonia or N 2 H 4 as the fuel of SOFC\u2013H + , both the CO 2 induced decomposition of electrolyte and the formation of NO x are avoided. In this study, an anode-supported SOFC with proton-conducting electrolyte of BaZr 0.1 Ce 0.7 Y 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BZCY) and mixed oxygen-ionic and electronic conducting cathode of Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) was fabricated. The performance of the fuel cell with hydrogen, ammonia and hydrazine as the fuels was comparatively studied. 2 Experimental Both BZCY and BSCF oxides were synthesized by a combined EDTA\u2013citrate complexing sol-gel process [9,10] . Anode-supported electrolyte dual-layer cells were fabricated using a co-pressing technique followed by high-temperature sintering. Anode powders were prepared by mixing NiO and BZCY in weight ratio of 60:40 with the help of a high-energy ball miller (Dalton, Pulverisette 6). To fabricate the single cell, the powders of NiO + BZCY were first pressed as a substrate, onto which a proper amount of fine BZCY powder was added and pressed again to form a bi-layer pellet [11] . The green pellets were then sintered in air at 1450 \u00b0C for 5 h to result in the densification of the electrolyte layer. BSCF slurry was spray deposited onto the central surface of the electrolyte and fired at 950 \u00b0C in air for 2 h. The phase structure of the oxides was examined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The microscopic features of the prepared electrodes or single cell were characterized using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM, QUANTA-2000). A single cell was sealed onto a quartz tube reactor with the cathode side exposed to ambient air while the anode swept with 3% H 2 O humidified H 2 at a flow rate of 80 ml/min [STP], or NH 3 at a flow rate of 60 ml/min [STP], or on-line catalytic decomposition products of N 2 H 4 by BSCF (0.5 g) at a temperature of 40 \u00b0C [12] . I \u2013 V polarization curves were collected using a digital source meter (Model 2420, Keithley, Cleveland, OH). Four-probe configuration was adopted. Silver paste was applied as the current collector. The electrochemical impedence spectroscopy (EIS) of the cell was investigated under open circuit voltage (OCV) conditions by AC impedance using an electrochemical workstation based on a Solartron 1260A frequency response analyzer in combination with a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The frequency applied was ranged from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz with a signal amplitude of 10 mV. 3 Results and discussion Fig.\u00a01 a shows the SEM morphologies of a typical three-layer single cell. The electrolyte with a thickness of \u223c35 \u03bcm was highly densified, which was composed of well-sintered grains with the main size of 2\u20133 \u03bcm ( Fig.\u00a01 b). Both the anode and the cathode were found to have good adhesion with the electrolyte layer ( Fig.\u00a01 c and d), which ensured a low contact resistance. The anode (reduced) was composed of particles with uniform size of \u223c3 \u03bcm, while the cathode was composed of grains with the particle size varied from 1 to 10 \u03bcm. No obvious interfacial layer was observed between BZCY electrolyte and BSCF cathode according to Fig.\u00a01 d. Fig.\u00a02 a and b shows the XRD diffractions of the electrolyte and cathode layers. The compositions of the electrolyte and cathode layers matched well to the perovskite-type BZCY and BSCF, respectively. The absence of serious reaction between BZCY and BSCF layers was further supported from the phase reaction experiment by mixing BSCF and BZCY powders in weight ratio of 50\u201350 followed by calcining at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h. As shown in Fig.\u00a02 c, the XRD patterns of the mixture after the calcinations can be indexed well based on a physical mixture of BSCF and BZCY. Fig.\u00a03 a shows the I \u2013 V curves of a typical cell with hydrogen fuel at temperatures varied from 450 to 750 \u00b0C. The linear response of cell voltage with the polarization current indicates that the concentration polarization was not appeared, even at high current density. It implies that there were sufficient pores inside the electrodes, ensuring the free gas diffusion. A peak power density of \u223c420 mW/cm 2 was achieved at 700 \u00b0C. The performance of fuel cells with the same electrolyte (BZCY) and anode (BZCY + Ni) but a different cathode composition has been reported in literature [3,13,14] . At 700 \u00b0C, Zuo et\u00a0al. got a peak power density of 270 mW/cm 2 with a Ba(Ce 0.4 Pr 0.4 Y 0.2 )O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode and electrolyte thickness of 65 \u03bcm [3] , Xie et\u00a0al. of 330 mW/cm 2 with a La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode and electrolyte thickness of 50 \u03bcm [13] , and Lin et\u00a0al. of 266 mW/cm 2 with a GdBaCo 2 O 5+ x cathode and electrolyte thickness of 10 \u03bcm [14] . At 550 \u00b0C we still obtained a peak power density as high as \u223c222 mW/cm 2 while Zuo and Lin both reported a value of \u223c85 mW/cm 2 [3,14] . Above results suggest that BSCF performed much better as a cathode of SOFC\u2013H + on BZCY electrolyte than the others, especially at lower temperatures. As shown in Fig.\u00a03 b are the corresponding impedances of the single cell at various temperatures under OCV conditions in Nyquist plots. The high-frequency intercept of the impedance spectrum gives the ohmic resistance of the cell ( R ohm ), which includes the resistive contributions of the electrolyte, the two electrodes, the current collectors and the lead wires. In this study, the ohmic resistance of the two electrodes, the current collectors and the lead wires were reasonably considered to be negligible. The low-frequency intercept gives the total resistance ( R ohm + R p ), which includes the ohmic resistance of the cell and the effective interfacial polarization resistance associated with the electrochemical reactions at the both electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces. The interfacial resistance which includes both the anode and cathode is 0.28 \u03a9 cm 2 at 600 \u00b0C. It is considerably lower than the reported values of 0.63 \u03a9 cm 2 for the similar cell with a GdBaCo 2 O 5+ x cathode [14] , 0.9 \u03a9 cm 2 with a La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode (650 \u00b0C) [13] , and 0.7 \u03a9 cm 2 with a Ba(Pr 0.4 Ce 0.4 Y 0.2 )O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode [3] . Above results support that the high power density achieved in this study is due to, at least in part, the improved cathode performance. At 500 \u00b0C, nearly half of the cell resistance was still contributed from the ohmic loss of the electrolyte, implying that a decrease of the electrolyte thickness would envisage noticeable increase in fuel cell performance further. The same cell was then investigated for operating on ammonia fuel. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 a are the corresponding I \u2013 V curves at furnace temperatures of 450\u2013750 \u00b0C. As compared to the results by applying hydrogen as the fuel, as shown in Fig.\u00a03 a, the OCVs were somewhat lowered. For example, an OCV of \u223c1.1 V was achieved at 450 \u00b0C for the cell operating on hydrogen fuel, while it was only \u223c0.98 V by applying ammonia as the fuel. Furthermore, the OCV was almost unchanged with respect to decreasing temperature, different from that operating on hydrogen, which showed a steady increase in OCV with decreasing temperature. When ammonia was adopted as the fuel for a SOFC\u2013O 2\u2212 , two anode reaction routes are possible. The ammonia could be directly electro-oxidized to N 2 and H 2 O via the electrochemical reaction as follows: 2NH 3 + 3O 2\u2212 \u2192 N 2 + 3H 2 O + 6e \u2212 or the ammonia was indirectly oxidized by first decomposed into N 2 and H 2 followed by electro catalytic oxidation of the hydrogen to form H 2 O: 2NH 3 \u2192 N 2 + 3H 2 H 2 \u2192 2H + + 2e \u2212 2H + + O 2\u2212 \u2192 H 2 O For the SOFC\u2013H + , since the water was mainly formed at the cathode side, the anode reaction was likely proceeded via the indirect route. It means that the unreacted NH 3 and the formed N 2 would serve as the diluting gas for H 2 , which may account, at least in part, for the relatively low OCV at reduced temperatures. At the same furnace temperature, as comparison to hydrogen fuel the peak power density was somewhat lowered when ammonia was applied as the fuel. For example, the peak power density was 465 and 390 mW/cm 2 , respectively, by applying hydrogen and ammonia as the fuel at a furnace temperature of 750 \u00b0C. To get more information to proper intercept the difference of cell performances with hydrogen and ammonia fuels, the cell impedance operated on ammonia fuel under OCV conditions was also measured with the results shown in Fig.\u00a04 b. Similar to that with hydrogen fuel, the impedance spectra are composed of two overlapped arcs. However, at the same furnace temperature the electrolyte resistance of the cell operating on NH 3 seems be higher than that on hydrogen. For example, it is 0.37 \u03a9 cm 2 at 750 \u00b0C by applying hydrogen fuel while it is about 0.42 \u03a9 cm 2 operating on ammonia. It suggests that the real cell temperature by applying ammonia fuel may be lower than the furnace temperature. It is well known that the ammonia decomposition reaction is endothermic in nature, 2 NH 3 \u2192 N 2 + 3 H 2 , \u0394 H 0 = 46.02 kJ/mol The in situ endothermic ammonia decomposition reaction over the anode then likely took the heat from the fuel cell and resulted in a lower cell temperature. Considering the same cell adopted and negligible impact of fuel type on the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, the electrolyte resistance should keep unchanged at the same cell temperature whether operating on hydrogen or ammonia fuels. The actual cell temperature at various furnace temperatures by applying ammonia fuel could then be estimated from the electrolyte resistance. A quasi linear response of 1/ R ohm versus 1000/ T was observed. The actual cell temperature with ammonia as the fuel was then estimated by fitting the electrolyte resistance measured by EIS into the temperature dependence of electrolyte resistance operating on hydrogen fuel. Cell temperatures of \u223c700, 669, 624, 535, 489, 450, 400 \u00b0C, respectively, were derived at the furnace temperature of 750, 700, 650, 600, 550, 500 and 450 \u00b0C with ammonia as the fuel. It indicates that the endothermic decomposition of ammonia could result in the cell temperature 30\u201365 \u00b0C lower than the furnace. Accounting the cooling effect of the ammonia decomposition reaction on the fuel cell, similar power density was observed for the cell operating on hydrogen and ammonia fuel at high cell temperatures. For example, the peak power density is around 420 mW/cm 2 at a cell temperature of 700 \u00b0C when operating on hydrogen, while it is \u223c390 mW/cm 2 by applying ammonia as the fuel. With the decrease of operating temperature, however, the difference in power density was enlarged. For example, a peak power density of 135 mW/cm 2 was achieved at a cell temperature of 450 \u00b0C by applying hydrogen as the fuel, while it was only 65 mW/cm 2 when operating on ammonia. As mentioned previously, the actual fuel for the direct electro-oxidation over the anode of SOFC\u2013H + is hydrogen when operating on ammonia. The cell performance strongly relies on the catalytic activity of anode towards the ammonia decomposition. The catalytic activity of Ni + BZCY anode for ammonia decomposition was then examined at OCV conditions. The ammonia conversion rate was then calculated based on the difference on the total flow rate between the inlet and outlet of the anode chamber. As shown in Fig.\u00a05 , at an operating temperature of 600 \u00b0C about 45% of the NH 3 was decomposed into N 2 and H 2 , while the conversion reached only 2% at 450 \u00b0C. The decrease of ammonia conversion resulted in lowering hydrogen concentration in the anode stream, which accounted at least in part for the relatively low OCV and poor power density at lower operating temperature. A modification of the anode composition for improving the catalytic activity of anode for ammonia decomposition is necessary in order to achieve high performance at reduced temperature. As shown in Figs. 3 b and 4 b, EIS of the single cell under OCV conditions are composed of two overlapped arcs when operating on hydrogen or ammonia fuel. The impedance spectroscopes are similar to each other for the cell operating on hydrogen and ammonia at temperatures higher than 600 \u00b0C. However, at lower temperature, the high-frequency arc was enlarged obviously when the ammonia was the fuel. Since the same atmosphere (air) was applied for the cathode chamber, the impedance contributed from the cathode should keep unchanged when varying the anode fuel. Therefore, the enlargement of the high-frequency arc was contributed from the increase in anode polarization resistance. Some researchers also observed a two-arc impedance based on single cell under OCV conditions, and they associated the high-frequency arc with the anode oxidation [15,16] . Although it is still not clear whether the high-frequency arc had also the contribution from the cathode, the important role of anode oxidation in the high-frequency impedance is undoubted. At cell temperature of 600 \u00b0C or higher, more than 45% of NH 3 was decomposed to N 2 and H 2 as demonstrated previously, the high hydrogen concentration then ensured a similar oxidation kinetics over the anode by applying ammonia or hydrogen as the fuel. Consequently, a similar electrode polarization resistance was observed. At lower temperatures, the catalytic activity of anode for NH 3 decomposition was reduced. Furthermore, the undecomposed NH 3 may competitively occupy the active site for H 2 adsorption. Both factors would lead to an increase of the anode polarization resistance. For portable application, the fuel should have high gravimetric or volumetric energy density and easy to store. N 2 H 4 is an ideal fuel for such purpose; it is a liquid at room temperature and ambient pressure. Recently we have demonstrated that N 2 H 4 can be catalytically decomposed into NH 3 , N 2 and H 2 at room temperature. The cathode material BSCF happens to be an excellent catalyst for N 2 H 4 catalytic decomposition. A new fuel cell was fabricated for the performance test operating on N 2 H 4 . About 0.5 g BSCF catalyst was dropped to 30 ml N 2 H 4 and heated at 40 \u00b0C by a water bath. The system was stirred homogeneously to avoid over heating since the N 2 H 4 decomposition reaction is exothermic in nature. The gaseous products, a mixture of mainly N 2 (\u223c23%), NH 3 (66%), and a small portion of H 2 (11%) [12] , were then introduced to the anode chamber of the fuel cell. For comparison, the cell performance was also investigated by applying hydrogen and ammonia as the fuels. As shown in Fig.\u00a06 is the I \u2013 V curves of the cell with an electrolyte thickness of \u223c35 \u03bcm at cell temperature of 600 \u00b0C. Comparable fuel cell performance was achieved at 600 \u00b0C operating on all the three fuels. The high-energy density and carbon-free composition of N 2 H 4 makes it a potential fuel for portable SOFC. Another significant advantage of N 2 H 4 is that the decomposition of hydrazine to N 2 and H 2 is exothermic in nature, N 2 H 4 \u2192 N 2 + 2 H 2 , \u0394 H 0 = \u2212 50.6 kJ/mol The heat released from the decomposition reaction may be applied to heat up the products. Under adiabatic conditions, the decomposition of N 2 H 4 at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) could heat up the products (N 2 + 2H 2 ) to \u223c608 \u00b0C. Therefore, no external heating system is needed once the decomposition reaction of N 2 H 4 can be made adiabatic. 4 Conclusions In this study, SOFCs composed of thin-film (\u223c35 \u03bcm) proton-conducting BZCY electrolyte was successfully fabricated. High cell performance at reduced temperatures was achieved by applying BSCF as the cathode material. When the cell was operated on ammonia, the anode reaction adopted the indirect route, i.e., the ammonia was first decomposed into H 2 and N 2 , and H 2 was then electro-oxidized into H 2 O to produce electricity. The endothermic nature of the ammonia decomposition resulted in cell temperature of 30\u201365 \u00b0C lower than the furnace. At the same cell temperature of 700 \u00b0C, the cell delivered similar performance whether operating on hydrogen or ammonia fuels. However, at lower temperature, the performance on ammonia is worse than hydrogen due to the reduced activity of anode towards the ammonia catalytic decomposition. When the decomposition products of hydrazine were applied as the fuel, the cell delivered comparable performance to that operating on ammonia. Since the liquid state of hydrazine at room temperature and ambient pressure and carbon-free composition; it is promising as fuel for portable SOFCs.

        "abstract": "On the purpose to perform as functional layer of SOFCs operating on methane fuel, NiFe-ZrO 2 alloy catalysts have been synthesized and investigated for methane partial oxidation reactions. Ni 4Fe 1-ZrO 2 shows catalytic activity comparable to that of Ni-ZrO 2 and superior to other Fe-containing catalysts. In addition, O 2-TPO analysis indicates iron is also prone to coke formation; as a result, most of NiFe-ZrO 2 catalysts do not show improved coking resistance than Ni-ZrO 2. Anyway, Ni 4Fe 1- ZrO 2 (Ni:Fe = 4:1 by weight) prepared by glycine-nitrate process shows somewhat less carbon deposition than the others. However, Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the addition of Fe does reduce the graphitization degree of the deposited carbon, suggesting the easier elimination of carbon once it is deposited over the catalyst. Ni 4Fe 1-ZrO 2 has an excellent long-term stability for partial oxidation of methane reaction at 850\u00b0C. A solid oxide fuel cell with conventional nickel cermet anode and Ni 4Fe 1-ZrO 2 functional layer is operated on CH 4-O 2 gas mixture to yield a peak power density of 1038 mW cm -2 at 850\u00b0C, which is comparable to that of hydrogen fuel. In summary, the Ni 4Fe 1-ZrO 2 catalyst is potential catalyst as functional layer for solid-oxide fuel cells operating on methane fuel. \u00a9 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

        "abstract": "A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a highly efficient device for converting chemical energy to electrical energy. In addition to the efforts to reduce the operating temperature of SOFCs to below 600 \u00b0C, research studies of the basic mechanism of CO2 poisoning on cathode materials are envisioned to improve the operation of dual-chamber SOFCs using ambient air. In this work, we comparatively studied the CO2 poisoning effect on two highly active perovskites SrSc0.175Nb0.025Co0.8O3-\u03b4 (SSNC) and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-\u03b4 (BSCF), using complementary characterisation techniques, e.g., powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The SSNC cathode shows better tolerance to CO2 as compared with BSCF, which is attributed to the absence of Ba, higher average metal-oxygen bond energy (ABE) of SSNC, and the higher acidity of Nb5+ cations, whereas the oxygen vacancy concentration plays a less important role.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Robust oxygen permeable ceramic membranes have potential applications in clean energy industries like oxyfuel power plants and green chemical synthesis like syngas production combining the separation and reaction in one unit. The well-known and highly permeable perovskite oxide membranes are limited by their lower chemical stability. In this work, a novel dual-phase hollow fiber membrane based on a fluorite Pr 0.1 Gd 0.1 Ce 0.8 O 2\u2212\u03b4 (PCGO) and a spinel CoFe 2 O 4 (CFO) composite was developed via a phased inversion/sintering method. Enhanced oxygen permeability and unprecedented high CO 2  resistance were realized by the 50\u00a0wt%PCGO\u201350\u00a0wt%CFO dual-phase hollow fiber membrane. The composite was synthesized via a one-pot sol-gel preparation method to achieve the homogenous distribution and the formation of percolative network of each phase for both oxygen ionic and electronic conduction purpose. The oxygen permeation flux of 0.54\u00a0mL\u00a0min \u22121 \u00a0cm \u22122  was achieved using He as sweep gas at 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. Membrane performance was further improved by coating a perovskite Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4   (BSCF) layer on the outside surface of the dual phase membrane to face the feed gas-air leaving the other membrane side untouched to maintain its high stability to withstand the harsh gas condition containing CO 2 . The dual phase membrane had been successfully operated at 950\u00a0\u00b0C in pure CO 2  atmosphere for more than 200\u00a0h with flux rate fixed at 0.40\u00a0mL\u00a0min \u22121 \u00a0cm \u22122  without any noticeable performance degradation or membrane deterioration. By contrast, the flux rate of pure perovskite membrane had been sharply dropped down by 80% albeit operated for only 8\u00a0h.",

        "abstract": "In this work, microwave (MW) irradiation was used to activate Co/Al2O3, Mo/Al2O3, and Co\u2013Mo/Al2O3 catalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM) reactions. Experimental results indicate that single metallic catalysts of either Co or Mo are inactive for DRM under all the tested conditions due to their limited MW-absorbing ability. In contrast, Co\u2013Mo bimetallic catalysts supported by Al2O3 exhibit high catalytic activity due to the formation of a magnetodielectric Co0.82Mo0.18 alloy, which plays the dual role of a good MW acceptor and the provider of active centers for the DRM reaction. The MW power level required to activate such bimetallic catalysts for DRM is significantly dependent on the molar ratio between Co and Mo. The CoMo2 catalyst (with a molar ratio of 2.0 Co to 1.0 Mo) supported on Al2O3 exhibits the best catalytic performance, converting 80% CH4 and 93% CO2 to syngas at a ratio of H2/CO of 0.80 at the total volumetric hourly space velocity (VHSV) of 10 L g\u22121 h\u22121 and MW power of 200 W. As compared to the reported C-based catalysts, the Co\u2013Mo/Al2O3 catalyst delivers more favorable stability over 16 time-on-stream (TOS) by virtue of its intrinsic ability to absorb MW without the inclusion of auxiliary MW acceptors.",

        "abstract": "In this review, the recent progress in the application of an important category of materials, i.e. ABO3 perovskite-type compounds in the fields of energy storage and conversion, is reviewed. Four main areas, as materials for oxygen transporting membrane toward the application in oxy-fuel combustion, as key material for solid oxide fuel cells for efficient power generation from fuels, as room-temperature electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, and as material for solar cells for solar energy harvest, are referred. Our past efforts in these research areas are emphasized. Some prospects about the future development in the application of perovskite materials in energy storage and conversion is proposed. \u00a9 2016 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Here, we have synthesized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels using a nanocellulose-assisted low temperature (less than 500\u00a0\u00b0C) thermal treatment route where nanocelluloses promote the gelation of graphene oxide (GO) solution that benefits the fabrication of GO aerogels from low concentration dispersion (2.85\u00a0mg\u00a0mL \u22121 ), and after their thermal decomposition the residual nanofibers act as spacer both prevent the re-stacking of graphene sheets and integrate with rGO sheets to give a particular kind of carbon-based aerogel along with numerous defects (holes). Thermal decomposition of nanocellulose appears to be complete beyond 350\u00a0\u00b0C thus its presence in form of amorphous carbon nanofibers in rGO sheets. The rGO aerogels synthesized at 350\u00a0\u00b0C provide the best balance in terms of wide interlayer spacing, high content of CO-type functional groups, and high defects content. This translates into a high discharge capacitance of 270\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at a current rate of 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121  for compressed rGO aerogels without any binder or conductive additive. Detailed electrochemical tests using 6\u00a0M KOH electrolyte establish the fact that pseudocapacitance component has substantial contribution towards the overall capacitance; closely approaching the contribution of the double layer capacitance that is the most dominant capacitance component.",

        "abstract": "Increasing energy demands have stimulated intense research activity on cleaner energy conversion such as regenerative fuel cells and reversible metal-air batteries. It is highly challenging but desirable to develop low-cost bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the lack of which is currently one of the major limiting components towards commercialization of these technologies. Here, we have conducted a systematic study on the OER and ORR performances of the Ruddlesden-Popper family of Lan+1 Nin O3n+1 (n=1, 2, 3, and \u221e) in an alkaline medium for the first time. It is apparent that the Ni-O bond lengths and the hyperstoichiometric oxides in the rock-salt layers correlate with the ORR activities, whereas the OER activities appear to be influenced by the OH(-) content on the surface of the compounds. In our case, the electronic configuration fails to predict the electrocatalytic activity of these compounds. This work provides guidelines to develop new electrocatalysts with improved performances.",

        "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have potential to be the cleanest and most efficient electrochemical energy conversion devices with excellent fuel flexibility. To make SOFC systems more durable and economically competitive, however, the operation temperature must be significantly reduced, which depends sensitively on the development of highly-active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at low temperatures. Here we report a novel silver nanoparticle-decorated perovskite oxide, prepared via a facile ex-solution process from a Sr0.95Ag0.05Nb0.1Co0.9O3-\u03b4 (SANC) perovskite precursor, as a highly active and robust ORR electrocatalyst for low-temperature SOFCs. The ex-solved Sr0.95Ag0.05Nb0.1Co0.9O3-\u03b4 (denoted as e-SANC) electrode is very active for ORR, achieving a very low area specific resistance (~0.214 \u03a9 cm2 at 500 oC). An anode-supported cell with the new heterostructured cathode demonstrates very high peak power density (1,116 mW cm-2 at 500 oC) and stable operation for 140 h at a current density of 625 mA cm-2. The superior ORR activity and stability are attributed to the fast oxygen surface exchange kinetics and the firm adhesion of the e-SANC electrode to the electrolyte. Moreover, the e-SANC cathode displays improved tolerance to CO2. These unique features make the new heterostructured material a highly promising cathode for low-temperature SOFCs.",

For example, its content is numerous and jumbled; its system is disorderly; the relationship close to subject is not distinct; the opinion of the subject nature is different, and so on. The cause is that the subject objective of education psychology is not clear. So stricdy defining the subject objective of education psychology has an important meaning. This article advances the own opinion, which considers that the research objective of education psychology is the psychology phenomena and disciplinarian of the teachers and students and their reciprocity in the teaching activity.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of different doses of parecoxib pretreatment on propofol injection pain. Methods A total of 160 ASA patients with physical status \u2160~\u2161 scheduled for elective surgery were randomized to four groups, with 40 patients each, to receive pretreatment with parecoxib 40 mg (Group A), parecoxib 20 mg (Group B), lidocaine 40 mg (Group C) , or normal saline (Group D). All pretreatment drugs were prepared in 5 ml doses. After 2 minute drug injection, the proplfol was administered. Pain scores were obtained by a study-blinded observer during propofol injection following the different pretreatment solutions. Results Pain scores among the four groups were significantly different. Pain was significantly reduced in Group A (P\u22640.01) compared with the control group. Moderate to severe pain was experienced by 33 (82.5%) patients in Group D and 4 (8%) patients in Group B, whereas no patient in Group A (P<0.01). Reduction in pain severity was statistically significant after pretreatment with either parecoxib 20 mg (P=0.002) or parecoxib 40 mg (P<0.01). Conclusion Parecoxib 40 mg pretreatment is effective to reduce the frequency and severity of pain with propofol injection. Pretreatment with 20 mg of parecoxib reduces the severity of propofol injection pain significantly but does not reduce frequency.",

        "abstract": "We aim to investigate the changes of The \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signals in the adjacent intact dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the contribution of these changes to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain (NPP). After establishment of neuropathic pain model with the lumbar 5 spinal nerve ligation (L5 SNL), the GABA-evoked currents were recorded in the acutely dissociated L4 DRG neurons using whole-cell patch clamp. Moreover, Muscimol or Bicuculline were respectively topically injected to the L4 DRG at the time of nerve injury and post-operative 5 days (POD5). The pain thresholds of hind paw were recorded. We found that the incidence and amplitude of GABA currents significantly decreased in the large and medium L4 DRG neurons after SNL (P<0.05). Furthermore, in the L5 SNL rats, 20 \u03bcg Muscimol injected immediately after injury caused a long-lasting attenuation of mechanical allodynia (P<0.05), whereas the thermal hyperalgesia was not alleviated (P>0.05). 0.15 \u03bcg Bicuculline further decreased the pain thresholds (P<0.05) and reversed the pain-alleviating effects of Muscimol. However, at POD5, 20 \u03bcg Muscimol only exhibited transient alleviating effects (P<0.05). In conclusion, the decrease of inhibition signal mediated by GABA-A receptor in the adjacent intact DRG neurons may be crucial in the development of hyperalgesia in NPP.",

        "abstract": "Providing effective pain management to acutely intoxicated trauma patients represents a challenge of balancing appropriate pain management with the risk of potential respiratory depression from opioid administration. The objective of this study was to quantify the incidence of respiratory depression in trauma patients acutely intoxicated with ethanol who received opioids as compared with those who did not and identify potential risk factors for respiratory depression in this population. Retrospective medical record review was conducted for subjects identified via the trauma registry who were admitted as a trauma activation and had a detectable serum ethanol level upon admission. Risk factors and characteristics compared included demographics, Injury Severity Score, Glasgow Coma Score, serum ethanol level upon arrival, urine drug screen results, incidence of respiratory depression, and opioid and other sedative medication use. A total of 233 patients were included (78.5% male). Patients who received opioids were more likely to have a higher Injury Severity Score and initial pain score on admission as compared with those who did not receive opioids. Blood ethanol content was higher in patients who did not receive opioids (0.205 vs 0.237 mg/dL, P = .015). Patients who did not receive opioids were more likely to be intubated within 4 hours of admission (1.7% vs 12.1%, P = .02). Opioid administration was not associated with increased risk of respiratory depression (19.7% vs 22.4%, P = .606). Increased cumulative fentanyl dose was associated with increased risk of respiratory depression. Increased cumulative fentanyl dose, but not opioid administration alone, was found to be a risk factor for respiratory depression.",

Chronic metoprolol therapy was defined as patients prescribed and taking oral metoprolol within 5days of study inclusion. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate<100bpm or <120bpm if the decrease was at least 20% from the presenting heart rate.A total of 332 patients were included, with 16 patients in the IV diltiazem group and 316 patients in the IV metoprolol group. In the diltiazem arm, 68.8% of patients achieved successful rate control compared to 42.4% of patients in the metoprolol group (p=0.067). Treatment with IV metoprolol resulted in more hospital admissions (58% vs. 6.25% with diltiazem, p<0.001). Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a greater incidence of bradycardia compared to IV metoprolol (13% vs. 0%, p=0.002).The use of IV diltiazem was associated with a higher rate of successful response to rate control compared to IV metoprolol in patients in AF with RVR on chronic beta-blocker therapy, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant.",

        "abstract": "Through next generation sequencing, this study evaluated the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of advanced breast cancer patients to prospectively explore the relationship between specific DNA mutations and prognosis as well as therapeutic decision making. The target region covered 1021 gene totally. Clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome data were collected. We analyzed progression-free survival (PFS) from first-line therapy and overall survival (OS), and found that their endpoints were correlated with observed gene mutations. We enrolled 54 patients, with a median follow-up time of 8 years. Mutations were found in , , and  family, at 40.7%, 35.2%, and 25.9%, respectively.  more frequently occurred in the site of 3140 A>G (p.H1047R) for 20.4% and HER2+ diseases, and it was associated with shorter median PFS and worse OS among HER2+ patients [mutant vs. wild type: 4 (range 2-9) vs. 8 (range 2-22) months, =0.006], and [mutant vs. wild type: 29 (range 12-74) vs. 64 (range 20-96) months, =0.043], respectively. The patients with mutations in  had shorter OS (median 64 vs. 121 months, =0.006). Multivariate analysis for HER2+ disease demonstrated that the  p.H1047R mutation was the only factor associated with shorter PFS (=0.025); while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis produces an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.789. The ctDNA analysis, found  p.H1047R mutation was more frequent in HER2+ disease and associated with worse OS. It was also the only mutation associated with shorter PFS through a multivariate analysis of HER2+ patients who were treated with trastuzumab, suggesting trastuzumab had lower activity in these patients. The presence of a  mutation was associated with worse OS.",

This study aimed at detecting plasma HER2 gene copy number (GCN) as a prognostic factor in HER2+ MBC patients using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: A total of 50 MBC patients were included in this retrospective study, 44 HER2+, and six HER2 negative (HER2-) as control. HER2 GCN in plasma either in base line or after trastuzumab treatment was detected by NGS technique. Plasma HER2 GCN of \u22642.22, u003e 2.22-4.0 and \u22654.0 were predefined as cut-off to classify patients into HER2 non-amplified, low or high HER2 GCN group. Results: We obtained values of plasma HER2 GCN ranging from 1.77 to 33.0 (median 2.35), with the number of patients in the three groups of 20, 16 and 14.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier method and COX hazard model, respectively. Results: The median age of this cohort was 31.7 years, with a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 28.4 months. Of the 153 patients, 24 patients (15.7%) had the immediate family history of tumor, and 11 patients (7.2%) were diagnosed with initial TNM stage \u2163. Bone metastasis was observed in 63 patients (41.2%), and was most commonly seen in first metastasis. By the end of April 2016, the median survival time was 31.3 months, and the 5-year survival rate was 18.1%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the immediate family history of tumor, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and larger tumor volume were the independent adverse prognostic factors (all P u003c 0.05). Conclusion: The prognosis of advanced breast cancer in young women is significantly affected by the age at the diagnosis, and is worse than other subtypes of breast cancer. Larger tumor volume, hormone receptor-negative and immediate family history of tumor are independent adverse prognostic factors.  DOI:10.3781/j.issn.1000-7431.2017.33.675",

The effects of catalyst loading, initial molar ratio of reactants, temperature and pressure on this esterification reaction were investigated. A kinetic model based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism was developed in which methacrylic acid and methanol were considered to be uniformly adsorbed on the surface of catalysts. Model parameters including reaction equilibrium constants, activation energy, enthalpy change, entropy change as well as rate constants were solved. Accuracy of the model was validated by means of both experimental proofs and standard deviation between the predicted data and experimental ones.

        "abstract": "With the increasing proportion of photovoltaic (PV) power in power systems, the problem of its fluctuation and intermittency has become more prominent. To reduce the negative influence of the use of PV power, we propose a short-term PV power prediction model based on the online sequential extreme learning machine with forgetting mechanism (FOS-ELM), which can constantly replace outdated data with new data. We use historical weather data and historical PV power data to predict the PV power in the next period of time. The simulation result shows that this model has the advantages of a short training time and high accuracy. This model can help the power dispatch department schedule generation plans as well as support spatial and temporal compensation and coordinated power control, which is important for the security and stability as well as the optimal operation of power systems.",

        "abstract": "Due to the development of photovoltaic (PV) technology and the support from governments across the world, the conversion efficiency of solar energy has been improved. However, the PV power output is influenced by environment factors, resulting in features of randomness and intermittency. These features may have a negative influence on power systems. As a result, accurate and timely power prediction data is necessary for power grids to absorb solar energy. In this paper, we propose a new PV power prediction model based on the Gradient Boost Decision Tree (GBDT), which ensembles several binary trees by the gradient boosting ensemble method. The Gradient Boost method builds a strong learner by combining weak learners through iterative methods and the Decision Tree is a basic classification and regression method. As an ensemble machine learning algorithm, the Gradient Boost Decision Tree algorithm can offer higher forecast accuracy than one single learning algorithm. So GBDT is of value in both theoretical research and actual practice in the field of photovoltaic power prediction. The prediction model based on GBDT uses historical weather data and PV power output data to iteratively train the model, which is used to predict the future PV power output based on weather forecast data. Simulation results show that the proposed model based on GBDT has advantages of strong model interpretation, high accuracy, and stable error performance, and thus is of great significance for supporting the secure, stable and economic operation of power systems.",

        "abstract": "A large bandgap is critical for the applications of quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators at room temperature. Based on the first-principles calculations, we predict that the methyl and ethynyl functionalized TlSb monolayers, namely, TlSb(CH3)2 and TlSb(C2H)2 films, own QSH states with large bandgaps of 0.13 and 0.272\u2009eV, which possess potential applications at room temperature. For TlSb(CH3)2, the QSH phase arises from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced s-p band inversion, while for TlSb(C2H)2, the QSH phase results from the SOC induced p-p bandgap opening. The QSH effect is further characterized by the Z2 topological invariant and topologically protected edge states. Significantly, the QSH states in TlSb(CH3)2 and TlSb(C2H)2 films are robust against external strain and various methyl/ethynyl coverages, making them especially flexible in the substrate selection. Besides, we find that h-BN is an ideal substrate for TlSb(CH3)2 and TlSb(C2H)2 films to keep QSH states with large bandgaps. Thus, the methyl an...",

This study aims to investigate the methylation status of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) promoter region in the endometrium of patients with uterine fibroids. The methylation of CDH1 was studied using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in the endometrial tissue of 102 patients with uterine fibroids and 50 control patients. The E-cadherin expression was examined by flow cytometry. The methylation rate of CDH1 promoter region was 33.3% in the endometrium of patients with uterine fibroids and 8% in the endometrium of women without fibroids. The frequency of CDH1 promoter methylation in the endometrium of patients with fibroids was significantly higher than that in the endometrium of women without fibroids (P = .001). Furthermore, the E-cadherin expression level in methylation-positive tissues was significantly lower than that in methylation-negative tissues (P = .017). These results suggest that epigenetic aberration of CDH1 may occur in the endometrium of patients with fibroids, which may be associated with E-cadherin protein expression in endometrial tissue.",

Methods  NCI-H1975 cells were treated with curcumin and gefitinib alone or in combination, and cell proliferation, clonogenic capacity and apoptosis were examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, clone forming experiments, and flow cytometry, respectively, while p38, extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2, and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation were examined using Western blotting.    Results  Compared with the effects of either agent alone, the combination of curcumin and gefitinib had a stronger suppressive effect on proliferation and the clonogenic capacity ( P   P   P      Conclusion  Co-treatment of curcumin and gefitinib significantly improves the ability of gefitinib to inhibit cell proliferation, suppress the clonogenic capacity and enhance apoptosis in NCI-H1975 cells, and these effects are possibly mediated  via  a decrease in phosphorylation of proteins in downstream pathways of the epidermal growth factor receptor.",
