These aneurysms are difficult for surgical or endovascular treatment, especially for ruptured aneurysms.To investigate the clinical and radiologic efficacy of parent artery occlusion (PAO) with embolic agent Onyx in the treatment of distal PICA aneurysm.Case records of 15 consecutive patients with 15 ruptured distal PICA aneurysms treated with Onyx embolization were reviewed retrospectively. The follow-up ranged between 6 and 52 months. Cerebral angiography or cerebra computed tomography-angiogram (CTA) was performed for follow-up radiological study. Two aneurysms had origin from tonsillomedullary segment, nine from telovelotonsillar segments, and four from cortical segments. All patients were treated with Onyx to occlude aneurysm and proximal portion of vessel in front of aneurysm via endovascular approach.Aneurysm was occluded completely in every patient. One patient died because of intra-procedure haemorrhage. Fourteen patients had good recovery and the last follow-up Glasgow outcome scale was 5. Head CT scan was performed in every survived patient before discharge. CT in 3 patients revealed cerebellar infarctions but without any neurological deficits. None of the 14 patients had rebleeding or fresh neurologic deficits during the follow-up period. Aneurysmal recanalization had not been observed in any of the survived patients.Onyx occlusion of proximal parent artery and aneurysm in the treatment of distal PICA aneurysm is safe and effective according to this study. Morphology and location of aneurysm are important to decide the therapeutic strategy.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To observe the clinical efficacy and influencing factors of interventional intracranial aneurysm embolization-induced oculomotor nerve palsy. Methods: The clinical data of 18 consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysmembolization-induced oculomotor nerve palsy were analyzed retrospectively. The relationships between the recovery of oculomotor palsy and the degree of preoperative palsy (complete, incomplete), time from onset to treatment (\u226414d, >14d), size of aneurism (\u22647mm, >7mm), with or without preoperative hemorrhage, and the compactness of embolization (complete, residual neck) were analyzed. All the patients were followed up for 24 months. Results: Circled digit oneAll the aneurysms of 18 patients were embolized successfully. The aneurysms of the 12 patients were embolized completely, and 6 had residual necks. Circled digit twoThe oculomotor palsy in 11 of the 18 patients recovered completely, 6 recovered partially. The total improving rate was 94.4%; one patient with recurrence of the aneurysm did not showed any improvement. Circled digit threeThere were no significant differences in the seriousness of preoperative oculomotor palsy, time from onset to treatment, size of aneurysm, with or without subarachnoid hemorrhage, and compactness of embolization on the recovery of oculomotor nerve palsy (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Aneurysm embolization may effectively improve aneurysm-induced oculomotor palsy. If no any improvement after embolization, recanalization of the aneurysm should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Apoptosis has been proven to play a crucial role in early brain injury pathogenesis and to represent a target for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previously, we demonstrated that astaxanthin (ATX) administration markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis in the early period after SAH. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In the present study, we tried to investigate whether ATX administration is associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway, which can play an important role in the signaling of apoptosis. Our results showed that post-SAH treatment with ATX could cause a significant increase of phosphorylated Akt and Bad levels, along with a significant decrease of cleaved caspase-3 levels in the cortex after SAH. In addition to the reduced neuronal apoptosis, treatment with ATX could also significantly reduce secondary brain injury characterized by neurological dysfunction, cerebral edema and blood-brain barrier disruption. In contrast, the PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, could partially reverse the neuroprotection of ATX in the early period after SAH by downregulating ATX-induced activation of Akt/Bad and upregulating cleaved caspase-3 levels. These results provided the evidence that ATX could attenuate apoptosis in a rat SAH model, potentially, in part, through modulating the Akt/Bad pathway.",

Brainstem lesion was suggested by magnetic resonance image study. Angiogram revealed a DAVF at a high cervical segment supplied by the meningeal branch of the right vertebral artery, with ascending and descending venous drainage. Complete obliteration of the fistula was achieved via transarterial Onyx embolization. Clinical cure was achieved in the follow-up period; meanwhile, imaging abnormalities of this case disappeared. Accordingly, we hypothesize that a brainstem lesion of this case was caused by craniocervical DAVF, which induced venous hypertension. Thus, venous drainage patterns should be paid attention to because they are important for diagnosis and theraputic strategy.",

        "abstract": "Neuroinflammation has been proven to play a crucial role in early brain injury pathogenesis and represents a target for treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Astaxanthin (ATX), a dietary carotenoid, has been shown to have powerful anti-inflammation property in various models of tissue injury. However, the potential effects of ATX on neuroinflammation in SAH remain uninvestigated. The goal of this study was to investigate the protective effects of ATX on neuroinflammation in a rat prechiasmatic cistern SAH model.Rats were randomly distributed into multiple groups undergoing the sham surgery or SAH procedures, and ATX (25 mg/kg or 75 mg/kg) or equal volume of vehicle was given by oral gavage at 30 min after SAH. All rats were sacrificed at 24 h after SAH. Neurologic scores, brain water content, blood-brain barrier permeability, and neuronal cell death were examined. Brain inflammation was evaluated by means of expression changes in myeloperoxidase, cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and nuclear factor kappa B DNA-binding activity.Our data indicated that post-SAH treatment with high dose of ATX could significantly downregulate the increased nuclear factor kappa B activity and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in both messenger RNA transcription and protein synthesis. Moreover, these beneficial effects lead to the amelioration of the secondary brain injury cascades including cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurological dysfunction, and neuronal degeneration.These results indicate that ATX treatment is neuroprotective against SAH, possibly through suppression of cerebral inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Astaxanthin (ATX) has been proven to ameliorate early brain injury (EBI) after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) by modulating cerebral oxidative stress. This study was performed to assess the effect of ATX on the Nrf2-ARE pathway and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of antioxidant properties of ATX in EBI after SAH. A total of 96 male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups. Autologous blood was injected into the prechiasmatic cistern of the rat to induce an experimental SAH model. Rats in each group were sacrificed at 24 h after SAH. Expressions of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. The mRNA levels of HO-1, NAD (P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and glutathione S-transferase-\u03b11 (GST-\u03b11) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It was observed that administration of ATX post-SAH could up-regulate the cortical expression of these agents, mediated in the Nrf2-ARE pathway at both pretranscriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Meanwhile, oxidative damage was reduced. Furthermore, ATX treatment significantly attenuated brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, cellular apoptosis, and neurological dysfunction in SAH models. This study demonstrated that ATX treatment alleviated EBI in SAH model, possibly through activating the Nrf2-ARE pathway by inducing antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes.",

Both phytase and endoglucanase activities in the supernatant were determined after methanol induction of GS115-phyA-EG. Phytase and endoglucanase activity reached 39.4% and 56.2% activity compared to GS115-phyA and GS115-EG, respectively. Properties of the mixed enzyme suggest that the optimal temperature and pH value be 55 degrees C and 5.5 respectively. Both phytase and endoglucanase showed greater than 80% activity across temperature ranges 45 degrees C to 55 degrees C and pH ranges 4.5 to 5.5.

        "abstract": "The mutant acid phytase (phyA ( m )) gene was modified by random mutagenesis to improve enzymatic activity by using an error-prone PCR (ep-PCR) strategy. The mutated gene was linearized and inserted into plasmid vector pPIC9K and transformed by electroporation into Pichia pastoris GS115. A single transformant, PP-NP(ep)-6A, showing the strongest phytase activity from among the 5,500 transformants, was selected for detailed analyses. Southern blot analysis of the mutant yeast transformant showed that phyA ( ep ) gene was integrated into the chromosome genome through single crossover with one copy of phyA. The kinetic parameters indicated that the mutant one showed 61% higher specific activity and 53% lower k (m) value than that of PP-NP(m)-8 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, the overall catalytic efficiency (k (cat)/k (m)) of the mutant one was 84% higher (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than that of PP-NP(m)-8. Nine bases were altered in the mutant sequences, which resulted in three amino acid changes, namely, Glu156Gly, Thr236Ala, and Gln396Arg. The structural predictions indicated that the mutations generated by ep-PCR somehow reorganized or remodeled the active site, which could lead to increasing catalytic efficiency.",

However, it is unable to maintain its stability due to high temperature during the feed pelleting process. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis in the Aspergillus niger N25 phyA (m) gene at residue 44I and 252 T, and they were replaced by glutamic acid and arginine. Single-site mutants I44E-PhyA and T252R-PhyA, as well as double-site mutant I44E/T252R-PhyA, were constructed to improve the thermostability of PhyA through hydrogen bondings and ionic interactions. The three mutant enzymes all showed more than 20 % improvement in thermostability compared to the wild-type enzyme after being heated at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min. Their melting temperatures (T m) were increased by 1, 1, and 1.2 \u00b0C, respectively. The k m values of I44E-PhyA, T252R-PhyA, and I44E/T252R-PhyA for sodium phytate were 78, 44, and 79 % lower (P <0.05) than that of the wild-type enzyme. Overall catalytic efficiency (k cat/k m) of I44E-PhyA, T252R-PhyA, and I44E/T252R-PhyA was improved by 310, 155, and 84 % (P <0.05) than that of the wild type, respectively.

The morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA gene were analyzed to identify the taxonomic position of the strain. Meanwhile, its cellulase producing conditions and degradation of several cellulose substrates were studied.A cellulose-producing strain P2 was obtained. Strain P2 is a gram-positive and aerobic bacterium. Its growth temperature ranges from 20 to 50 degrees C (optimum at 37 degrees C) and pH 6.0 to 9.0 (optimum at 7.0), and NaCl concentration at 0%-15% (optimum at 2.0%). It took 24 h to reach the peak of cellulase production. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence showed that strain P2 is most closely related to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens NBRC15535 with the similarity of 99. 66% . Strain P2 posses different abilities to degrade four different cellulose substrates including filter paper, absorbent cotton, straw, and bamboo fiber. During the degradation, it shows different enzymatic activity curves with endoglucanases, exoglucanases, beta-glucosidases and cellulase.An aerobic cellulolytic bacterium was isolated from feces of giant pandas for the first time, and was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Due to its ability to degrade the cellulose materials with different structures, strain P2 could be used in the further study on the digestion mechanism of bamboo of giant panda.",

The fusion phytase phyA(m)-phyCs gene was successfully overexpressed in P. pastoris as an active and extracellular phytase. The yield of total extracellular fusion phytase activity is (25.4+/-0.53) U/ml at the flask scale and (159.1+/-2.92) U/ml for high cell-density fermentation, respectively. Purified fusion phytase exhibits an optimal temperature at 55 degrees C and an optimal pH at 5.5~6.0 and its relative activity remains at a relatively high level of above 70% in the range of pH 2.0 to 7.0. About 51% to 63% of its original activity remains after incubation at 75 degrees C to 95 degrees C for 10 min. Due to heavy glycosylation, the expressed fusion phytase shows a broad and diffuse band in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). After deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H (EndoH(f)), the enzyme has an apparent molecular size of 95 kDa. The characterization of the fusion phytase was compared with those of phyCs and phyA(m).",

The maximal enzyme activity of collagenase was obtained at pH 7.5, and it was stable over a pH range of 6.5-8.0. The collagenase activity was strongly inhibited by Mn(2+), Pb(2+), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, and beta-mercaptoethanol. However, Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) greatly increased its activity. The collagenase from B. pumilus Col-J showed highly specific activity towards the native collagen from calf skin. The K(m) and V(max) of the enzyme for collagen were 0.79 mg/mL and 129.5 U, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Genome-wide identification, expression analysis and potential functional characterization of previously uncharacterized MADS family of tartary buckwheat, emphasized the importance of this gene family in plant growth and development. The MADS transcription factor is a key regulatory factor in the development of most plants. The MADS gene in plants controls all aspects of tissue and organ growth and reproduction and can be used to regulate plant seed cracking. However, there has been little research on the MADS genes of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), which is an important edible and medicinal crop. The recently published whole genome sequence of tartary buckwheat allows us to study the tissue and expression profiles of the MADS gene in tartary buckwheat at a genome-wide level. In this study, 65 MADS genes of tartary buckwheat were identified and renamed according to the chromosomal distribution of the FtMADS genes. Here, we provide a complete overview of the gene structure, gene expression, genomic mapping, protein motif organization, and phylogenetic relationships of each member of the gene family. According to the phylogenetic relationship of MADS genes, the transcription factor family was divided into two subfamilies, the M subfamily (28 genes) and the MIKC subfamily (37 genes). The results showed that the FtMADS genes belonged to related sister pairs and the chromosomal map showed that the replication of FtMADSs was related to the replication of chromosome blocks. In different tissues and at different fruit development stages, the FtMADS genes obtained by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed obvious expression patterns. A comprehensive analysis of the MADS genes in tartary buckwheat was conducted. Through systematic analysis, the potential genes that may regulate the growth and development of tartary buckwheat and the genes that may regulate the easy dehulling of tartary buckwheat fruit were screened, which laid a solid foundation for improving the quality of tartary buckwheat.",

In this study, the 5' flanking region of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene was isolated from Fagopyrum tataricum by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR method, named PFtPal (GenBank: KF463139). To investigate the functional properties of PFtPal, we constructed a series of plant expression vectors that contained different promoter fragments resulting from nest deletions and had successfully transformed them into tobacco leaves by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Histochemical assay of GUS suggested that PFtPal could drive GUS gene expression in leaves and roots, while GUS activity was not detected in the stem. In addition, the region of -274 bp to -1 bp was enough to drive normal expression of GUS gene. Low temperature treatment of transgenic tobacco plants demonstrated that PFtPal conferred cold-induced expression. Taken together, our study will help to better understand the Pal promoter, and provides a candidate promoter for molecular breeding in Fagopyrum plants. ? 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.",

SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing condition showed that FtTI is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of approximately 14kDa. The complete amino acid sequence of FtTI was established by automatic Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. It was found that the trypsin inhibitor molecule consists of 86 amino acid residues containing two disulfide bonds which connect Cys(8) to Cys(65) and Cys(49) to Cys(58). The active site of the inhibitor was found to contain an Asp(66)-Arg(67) bond. MALDI-TOF analysis showed that FtTI has two isoforms (Mr: 11.487 and 13.838kDa). Dixon plots revealed a competitive inhibition of trypsin with inhibition constants (Ki) of 1.6nM. Analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests that FtTI is a member of the protease inhibitor I family. What is more, FtTI exhibited strong inhibitory activity against phytopathogenic fungi.",

To analyze the expression of CHI and the total flavonoids content during florescence of F. dibotrys. Methods: The cDNA sequence of CHI was cloned by homology cloning from F. dibotrys. The expression of CHI was analyzed in the different tissues during florescence by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The content of total flavonoids was measured by AlCl3 method. Results: The open reading frame (ORF) of FdCHI was 750 bp and encoded a protein with 249 amino acids. Bioinforamtion analysis suggested that the amino acid sequence of FdCHI had the high homology with those in other plants. Gene expression analysis showed that FdCHI was highly expressed in the flowers, followed by the roots and leaves, while lower in the stems. The content of total flavonoids was the highest in the flowers then the leaves and stems, and the lowest was in the roots. Conclusion: The cDNA sequence of FdCHI is firstly obtained from F. dibotrys and its coding protein has the typical characteristic of CHI homologous protein. The gene expression of FdCHI shows the same to the total flavonoids content in the stems, leaves, and flowers, but different in the roots of F. dibotrys.",

        "abstract": "Two strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing prodigiosin were isolated from meat in the Sichuan province of China in 2010. The strains were identified by Vitek system, 16S rDNA, rpoB, pfs and luxS genes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the broth microdilution method. The two strains were screened for the presence of \u00df-lactamase genes (bla TEM, bla SHV, bla OKP, and bla CTX-M genes). Based on PCR amplification and 16S rDNA sequencing the analysed strains were identified as Serratia marcescens. In addition, morphological and biochemical identification showed that the two stains were definitely S. marcesens. Antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that both strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins while being susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, imipenem and aztreonam. It was found that blaOKP had been identified first from the two S. marcescens strains, ch1 and ch2. The isolates were closely related as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The narrow-spectrum OKP-A \u00df-lactamase gene blaOKP-A-13 was found to be chromosomally located in S. marcescens. The isolates produced a \u00df-lactamase with a pI of approximately 8.2, which corresponds to the OKPA family. Findings indicate that OKP enzymes are not Klebsiella pneumoniae-specific chromosomal \u00df-lactamases, and the first isolation of S. marcescens producing OKP-A \u00df-lactamase suggests that the blaOKP gene may be disseminated between different species.",

The yield of total extracellular phytase activity was 17.6 U/ml induced in Buffered Methanol-complex Medium (BMMY) and 18.5 U/ml in Wheat Bran Extract Induction (WBEI) medium at the flask scale, respectively, improving over 90 folds compared with the wild-type isolate. Purified enzyme showed temperature optimum of 70 degrees and pH optimum of 7.5. The enzyme activity retained 97% of the relative activity after incubation at 80 degrees for 5 min. Because of the heavy glycosylation the expressed phytase had a molecular size of approximately 51 kDa. After deglycosylation by endoglycosylase H (EndoH(f)), the enzyme had an apparent molecular size of 42 kDa. Its property and thermostability was affected by the glycosylation.",

This study will help in understanding evolutionary mechanisms and relationships among the taxes in this section. The karyotypes of three species, F. densovillosum, F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes are being reported for the first time. F. esculentum, F. cymosum, F. tataricum and F. densovillosum are diploid while F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes are tetraploid, 2n = 4x = 32. At diploid level, the variation of the buckwheat chromosome karyotypes is bigger; however, on the tetraploid level, it shows a higher similarity. The karyotype evolutionary trend of buckwheat indicated that F. densovillosum seemed to be more advanced than F. gracilipes var. odontopterum and F. gracilipes. F. densovillosum, F. gracilipes var. odontopterum. and F. gracilipes were found more closely related genetically whereas F. tataricum clustered into a separate group. F. esculentum and F. cymosum clustered together in one separate group. \u00a9 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Flavonoids, such as anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin, can be accumulated in plants for resistance to abiotic stresses, for instance, UV-B and cold. In this study, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene named  was isolated from tartary buckwheat. A phylogenetic tree suggested that FtMYB15 potentially plays a role in flavonoid biosynthesis. Consequently, the ectopic overexpression of  was conducted in . Transgenic lines exerted increased pigmentation in leaves and seed coats, as well as higher accumulation levels of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin in . Specifically, anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin in transgenic lines were 8.62- and 4.93 (\u2009<\u20090.01)-fold higher than wild-type , respectively. Meanwhile, the expressions of both early and late biosynthesis genes, including , and , in the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pathway were enhanced (\u2009<\u20090.01).

        "abstract": "The present study aims to demonstrate the \u03b2-lactam resistance phenotypes and genotypes of Escherichia coli isolates from the Fu River in Chengdu, southwestern China. We obtained 108 E. coli isolates from nine sampling sites during May and December 2010. The total bacterial count varied from 79 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml to 14,550 CFU/ml, and coliform group number from 13 to 1,435 MPN/ml. Among the 108 isolates, 0-31.48% were resistant to \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactam inhibitors, 1.85-7.40% to aminoglycoside, 1-20% to fluoroquinolone, and 50% to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. The total bacterial count and antimicrobial resistance of different sites were significantly correlated (P < 0.05). Among the 34 ampicillin-resistant isolates, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing showed that bla (TEM), bla (SHV), and bla (CTX-M) were detected in 85.29% (n = 29), 41.18% (n = 14), and 5.88% (n = 2) of the isolates, respectively, whereas bla (KPC) and bla (GES) were not observed in any of the isolates. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR patterns revealed that the 34 ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates belonged to three distinct groups. Plasmid DNAs from the 14 SHV producer isolates yielded one to five bands of ca. 0.15-40 kb. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to describe the phenotypic and genetic characterizations of \u03b2-lactam resistance in E. coli isolates of river water origin from the Fu River, Chengdu, southwestern China. Results of the present study suggest that the river water may be considered as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes.",

The obtained sequences were analyzed by bioinformatics software. The ORF of PAL gene was cloned into expression vector pET-30b(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for expression the recombined protein. The catalytic activity of the recombined protein was determined by Spectrophotometer and thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods.The DNA sequence of PAL gene (designated as FdPAL, GenBank accession number: HM628904) was 2 583 bp in size, of which consisted two extrons and a single intron, and the full-length cDNA of FdPAL was 2 169 bp in size, which contained an ORF. The deduced protein of FdPAL contained 722 amino acids with calculated molecular weight (MW) of 78.31 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.94. The SDS-PAGE results showed that the molecular weight of recombinant FdPAL protein was 75.37 kDa, which is consistent with the predictions. After 4 hours of induction, the enzymatic specific activity of FdPAL reached the summit, up to 4 386 nmol x g(-1) x min(-1). The reaction products were also identified by TLC, using L-Phe and trans-cinnamic acid as the internal standard.The PAL gene (both DNA sequence and full-length cDNA sequence) was cloned from F. dibotrys, and it has the same classic characters as other PALs in plants. The recombinant FdPAL was efficiently expressed in E. coli and had the activity for catalyzing the conversion from L-phenylalanine to cinnamic acid.",

About 51% to 63% of its original activity remains after incubation at 75 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. Due to heavy glycosylation, the expressed fusion phytase shows a broad and diffuse band in SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis).

The gene without the signal peptide was then ligated with the expression plasmid pHIS1525. The recombination plasmid pHIS1525 was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a and the transformant was designated DH5a-pHIS1525-G7. The plasmid from the recombinant DH5a-pHIS1525-G7 was transformed into the proto-plasts of Bacillus megaterium strains WH320, and the genetically engineered bacterium, known as WH320-pHIS1525-G7, was acquired. The effective expression of the gene in the recombinant was confirmed by Congo-red dyeing and SDS poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). WH320-pHIS1525-G7 was cultured in optimum condition. The activity of the endoglucanase was 899U, which was 11.22-fold higher than that of B.subtilis C-36. The properties of enzyme were deter-mined. The optimum temperature and pH value were 65 and pH 6.0, respectively. The enzyme maintained over 80% of the original enzyme activity between pH 4.5 and pH 10.0 after incubated at 50 for 30 min.",

The full-length cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 2,586 nucleotides, encoding 862 amino acids with a potential secretion signal. The A. oryzae GIF-10 bgl was functionally expressed in Pichia pastoris. After 7-day induction, protein yield reached 321 mg/mL. Using salicin as the substrate, the specific activity of the purified enzyme reached 215 U/mg. The purified recombinant \u03b2-glucosidase was a 110-kDa glycoprotein with optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 50 \u00b0C. The enzyme was stable between 20 and 60 \u00b0C, and retained 65% of its activity after being held at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. The recombinant \u03b2-glucosidase was relatively stable in a broad range of pHs, from 4.0 to 6.5. It showed broad specific activity, hydrolyzing a range of (1-4)-\u03b2-diglycosides and (1-4)-\u03b1-diglycosides, and Mn(2+) stimulated its activity significantly.",

The phytase crystal possesses the special spatial structure of a propeller-like with six blades. Calcium ions play a very importance role on the relationship between the structure and the function of stability and catalytic activity. A larruping catalytic mechanism is showed by this phytase. Phytase gene of Bacillus is very different from the phytase genes known before, so it' s a kind of new phytase. Currently, the prokaryote is the main system to express Bacillus phytase. Furthermore, the analysis indicates the Bacillus and yeast expression systems would become the effective way to product phytase in large-scale fermentation.",

It is the objective to express an endoglucanase gene in Pichia pastoris and find out expression conditions for high-level expression of neutral endoglucanase. According to the sequence of endoglucanase gene (GenBank accession No.DQ782954) from Bacillus subtilis, a pair of primers was designed and synthesized, and a high-fidelity polymerase was used for amplifying the mature endoglucanase expression gene. A 1.4 kb fragment, which does not contain signal peptide sequence, was obtained and ligated to expression vector pPIC9k. pPIC-End was constructed and transformed to Pichia pastoris GS115. Three transformants named GS115-pPIC-End\u2160, GS115-pPIC-End\u2166 and GS115-pPIC-End\u2167 were obtained through MD, MM plate screening and enzymatic activity test. The expression conditions containing the initial cell density, pH and methanol concentration were studied in shake culture. Optimal endoglucanase production was observed when the initial cell density OD600 was 5, and the optimal methanol concentration was 0.5%~1.0%. The endoglucanase production increased obviously when provided adequate aeration, whereas it did not seem to vary when cells were induced at pH 4~8. Under the above expression condition, the endoglucanase activity of the three transformants was 860.7, 760.3 and 786.2 U, 13.5, 11.9 and 12.3 times compared with the endoglucanase activity of the original strain (63.78 U), respectively. The enzyme maintained over 80% of the original enzyme activity after incubated at 65 \u2103 for 30 min, and the SDS-PAGE showed that the molecular weight was about 79.82 kD.",

Neutral endoglucanase (EG1) gene was cloned from Bacillus subtilis and expressed Pichia pastoris in our previous study. Redesigned endoglucanases enhanced cellulase domain, added and deleted carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), named EG2, EG3, and EG4, respectively, were constructed in this study. The redesigned EG genes were expressed in P. pastoris, and their characters were also discussed. The optimal temperature and pH value of the all EGs was 65 \u00b0C and 6.0, respectively, where their enzymatic activities in P. pastoris cultivation supernatant reached 867, 651, 966, and 881 U/mL. EG2 showed 24.9 % enzymatic activity loss compared to natural endoglucanase. EG4 showed specific activity 30 % loss and thermostability decrease compared to EG1, which suggested CBM played an important role in improving the catalytic power and heat stability of cellulase family which attached. The specific activity of EG2 and EG3 showed similar to EG1, which suggested neither enhancement of CD nor CBM to endoglucanase can improve its catalytic power, which might rest with its intact topologic structure.",

        "abstract": "Two strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing prodigiosin were isolated from meat in the Sichuan province of China in 2010. The strains were identified by Vitek system, 16S rDNA, rpoB, pfs and luxS genes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the broth microdilution method. The two strains were screened for the presence of \u03b2-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOKP, and blaCTX-M genes). Based on PCR amplification and 16S rDNA sequencing the analysed strains were identified as Serratia marcescens. In addition, morphological and biochemical identification showed that the two stains were definitely S. marcesens. Antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that both strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins while being susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, imipenem and aztreonam. It was found that blaOKP had been identified first from the two S. marcescens strains, ch1 and ch2. The isolates were closely related as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The narrow-spectrum OKP-A \u03b2-lactamase gene blaOKP-A-13 was found to be chromosomally located in S. marcescens. The isolates produced a \u03b2-lactamase with a pI of approximately 8.2, which corresponds to the OKPA family. Findings indicate that OKP enzymes are not Klebsiella pneumoniae-specific chromosomal ?-lactamases, and the first isolation of S. marcescens producing OKP-A ?-lactamase suggests that the blaOKP gene may be disseminated between different species.",

This paper reports the finding of a flavonol synthase (FLS) gene, cloned and characterized from F. tataricum and designated FtFLS1, that is involved in rutin biosynthesis. The FtFLS1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the recombinant soluble FtFLS1 protein had a relative molecular mass of 40 kDa. The purified recombinant protein showed, with dihydroquercetin as substrate, total and specific activities of 36.55 \u00d7 10(-3) IU and 18.94 \u00d7 10(-3) IU/mg, respectively, whereas the total and specific activities were 10.19 \u00d7 10(-3) IU and 5.28 \u00d7 10(-3) IU/mg, respectively, with dihydrokaempferol. RT-PCR revealed that during F. tataricum florescence there was an organ-specific expression pattern by the FtFLS1 gene, with similar trends in flavonoid content. These observations suggest that FtFLS1 in F. tataricum encodes a functional protein, which might play a key role in rutin biosynthesis.",

Recombined at expression vectors pET30b-FphyA(m) was served as a template to amplify phytase gene, and the PCR product named elongation mutation gene phyA(e) was expanded with a 13 amino acid sequence from pET-30b-FphyA(m) vector at C-terminal of phytase gene phyA(m). Furthermore, phyA(e) gene was recombined into expression vector pPIC9k and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The comparison experiment of mutant phytase PP-NP0 with wild-type phytase PP-NP(m)-8 showed that: the optimum temperature of PP-NPe was increased by 3 degrees C, and its thermostability was increased by 21% when it was exposed to 10 min at 75 degrees C. Its effective reaction pH range with catalysis efficiency above 70% was pH 4.6 - pH 6.6, and wider 0.4 pH value than that of wild-type phytase.",

        "abstract": "Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) contains high concentrations of flavonoids. The flavonoids are mainly represented by rutin, anthocyanins and proanthocyanins in tartary buckwheat. R2R3-type MYB transcription factors (TFs) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. In this study, two TF genes, FtMYB1 and FtMYB2, were isolated from F. tataricum and characterized. The results of bioinformatic analysis indicated that the putative FtMYB1 and FtMYB2 proteins belonged to the R2R3-MYB family and displayed a high degree of similarity with TaMYB14 and AtMYB123/TT2. In vitro and in vivo evidence both showed the two proteins were located in the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activities. During florescence, both FtMYB1 and FtMYB2 were more highly expressed in the flowers than any other organ. The overexpression of FtMYB1 and FtMYB2 significantly enhanced the accumulation of proanthocyanidins (PAs) and showed a strong effect on the target genes' expression in Nicotiana tabacum. The expression of dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) was upregulated to 5.6-fold higher than that of control, and the expression level was lower for flavonol synthase (FLS). To our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of two MYB TFs from F. tataricum that control the PA pathway.",

Sequence analysis and function prediction were performed as well.Sequencing results showed that three different gene fragments of MYB transcription factor were cloned and named separately as LpMYB1,LpMYB2 and LpMYB3.The DNA lengths of LpMYB1,LpMYB2 and LpMYB3 were 221 bp,221 bp and 202 bp,which included 103 bp,103 bp and 84 bp introns,respectively.All of them encoded 39 amino acids.Sequence homologous comparison showed that these three genes might be involved in adversity response and morphogenesis of Lolium perenne L. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that phylogenetic development of the three genes was consistent with the evolutionary model of monocotyledons.The results showed that the three MYB genes were involved in the expression of resistance and development of Lolium perenne L. ,which provides a foundation for study of function of MYB transcription factor gene in Lolium perenne L.",

The results showed pepsin presented the highest yield of collagen from silver carp scale,and the optimum condition with yield rate of 56.8% was processed at 40 \u2103 and pH2 with 4% enzyme for 48 h. The molecular weight of scale collagen was mainly ranged from 30.0 ku to 94.0 ku by SDS-PAGE. Analysis of amino acid elements indicated,in collagen extracted from silver carp scale,the highest proportion was Gly(glycine),Pro(proline) and Glu(glutaminic acid) took the second place,and Cys (cystine) and Tyr (tyrosine) showed the low content. All the above data are consistent with the property of standard collagen type\u2160. Furthermore,the collagen viscosity decreased with the elevation temperature,and its emulsification capability was inferior to standard collagen type\u2160.",

The neutral endoglucanase (EG1) gene was reconstructed. A redesigned endoglucanase, named EG2, was constructed with a CBM containing a linker from Corticium rolfsii (GenBank Accession No. D49448). The redesigned EG genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their characteristics are discussed. Results showed that the degradation of cellulose by EG2 was about double that by EG1. The specific activities of EG1 and EG2 were tested under optimal conditions, and EG2 had higher activity (169.1 \u00b1 2.74 U/mg) toward CMC-Na than did EG1 (84.0 \u00b1 1.98) in the process of cellulose degradation. The optimal pH and temperature, pH stability, and heat stability of EG1 and EG2 were similar. Results indicated that the CBM plays an essential role in the hydrolysis of cellulose. We can improve EG's catalytic power by adding the CBM from Corticium rolfsii.",

        "abstract": "Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is a traditional coarse cereal that exhibits strong plasticity in its adaptation to harsh and complicated environmental stresses. In an attempt to study the strong tolerance of tartary buckwheat, the FtMYB9 gene, which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor protein, was functionally investigated. FtMYB9 expression was rapidly and strongly induced by ABA, cold, salt, and drought treatments in the seedling stage. A yeast one-hybrid system assay indicated that FtMYB9 is an activator of transcriptional activity, consistent with its roles as a transcription factor. Its overexpression in plants resulted in increased sensitivity to ABA at the germination and seedling stages compared to wild type. The overexpression of FtMYB9 increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses by the activation of some stress-related genes from both ABA-independent and ABA-dependent pathways in transgenic Arabidopsis. Furthermore, enhanced proline content and the activation of the P5CS1 gene implied that FtMYB9 may be involved in proline synthesis in plants. Collectively, these results suggest that FtMYB9 functions as a novel R2R3-MYB TF which plays positive roles in salt and drought tolerance by regulating different stress-responsive signaling pathways.",

Here, we found that the expression of a bHLH gene, FtbHLH2, was induced significantly by cold treatments in Tartary buckwheat seedlings. Subcellular localization indicated that FtbHLH2 localized in nucleus. Its overexpression in Arabidopsis increased tolerance to cold. The Arabidopsis plants overexpressing FtbHLH2 displayed higher root length and photosynthetic efficiency, and had lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) after cold treatment compared to wild type (WT) plants. Meanwhile, the expression levels of some stress-related genes in transgenic plants were remarkably higher than that in wild type under normal and/or stress conditions. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis lines with the FtbHLH2 promoter had higher GUS activity after cold stress. On the whole, the results suggest that FtbHLH2 may play a positive regulatory in cold stress of Tartary buckwheat.",

        "abstract": "Abiotic stress causes various negative impacts on plants, such as water loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and decreased photosynthesis. R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in the response of plants to abiotic stress. However, their functions in Tartary buckwheat, a strongly abiotic and resistant coarse cereal, haven't been fully investigated. In this paper, we report that a R2R3-MYB from Tartary buckwheat, FtMYB13, is not an activator of transcriptional activity but is located in the nucleus. Moreover, compared to the wild type (WT), transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing FtMYB13 had a lower sensitivity to ABA and caused improved drought/salt tolerance, which was attributed to the higher proline content, greater photosynthetic efficiency, higher transcript abundance of some stress-related genes and the smaller amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the transgenic lines compared to WT. Consequently, our work indicates that FtMYB13 is involved in mediating plant responses to ABA, as well as salt and drought.",

        "abstract": "Anthocyanins confer the red color in the hypocotyl of tartary buckwheat sprouts. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT) stabilizes anthocyanin by attaching the glucosyl moiety from UDP-glucose to the C3 hydroxyl of anthocyanin. In this study, we characterized three UFGT-like genes, designated FtUFGT1, 2, and 3 from tartary buckwheat. The results revealed that FtUFGT1, FtUFGT2, and FtUFGT3 can convert cyanidin to cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, with specific activities of 20.01 \u00d7 10(-3), 8.93 \u00d7 10(-3), and 20.24 \u00d7 10(-3) IU/mg, respectively. The active-site residues of the C-terminal domains and the N-terminal domains are important for the donor and acceptor recognition of these proteins. The expression of the three FtUFGTs paralleled the tissue-specific anthocyanin accumulation. After cold treatment, the increased content of anthocyanin was accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the three FtUFGTs. Among these three UGFT gene members, FtUFGT3 showed the highest expression level and the highest specific activity, suggesting that FtUFGT3 might be the major gene involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results suggested that the FtUFGT genes, FtUFGT3 in particular, might be important candidates for anthocyanin formation in tartary buckwheat sprouts. ",

MYB transcription factors play key roles in various physiological, biochemical and molecular responses, which can both positively and negatively regulate the stress tolerance of plants. In this study, we report that the expression of FtMYB10, a R2R3-MYB gene from Tartary buckwheat, was induced significantly by ABA and drought treatments. A seed germination test under ABA treatment indicated that transgenic lines were less sensitive to ABA. The overexpression of FtMYB10 in Arabidopsis reduced drought and salt tolerance. Further studies showed that the proline contents in the transgenic plants are markedly decreased associated with reduced expression of the P5CS1 gene under both normal and stress conditions. Furthermore, the expression of some stress-responsive genes, including DREB1/CBFs, RD29B, RD22, and several genes of the DRE/CRT class, decreased in response to FtMYB10 overexpression in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that FtMYB10 may play a key role in ABA signaling feedback regulation and act as a novel negative regulator of salt and drought stress tolerance in plants.",

Here, we show a genome-wide comparison of their transcriptomes by using an RNA-seq approach to elucidate the different molecular metabolism on the flowers from Black tartary buckwheat (HEIFENG No1) and yellow tartary buckwheat (XIQIAO No2). Over 48.4 million paired-end reads were assembled into 57,800 unigenes, of which about 57.9% (33, 472 unigenes) were annotated by BLAST searches in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. RPKM analysis showed that compared to YTB, the unigenes encoding phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI) for early flavonoid synthesis and the unigene encoding quercetin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) for synthetizing rutin were at a higher level, but the unigene encoding Flavonol synthase (FLS) charging for kaempferol and quercetin synthesis at a lower level in BTB, which may be the reason for the higher content of rutin and the lower content of quercetin, the result obtained by HPLC, as confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of these genes. The result will not only explain the molecular mechanism of flavonoid synthesis in balck tartary buckwheat, but also provide the basis for further genomics research on this species or its allies.",

        "abstract": "Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) contains high concentration of flavonoids, which are mainly represented by rutin, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. WD40 transcription factors (TFs) play significant roles in the transcriptional regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. In this study, a WD40-repeat protein gene (designated as FtWD40) was identified and characterized from tartary buckwheat. The bioinformatics analyses showed that the putative FtWD40 shared a high level of similarity with MtWD40-1, which is a positive regulator in anthocyanin biosynthesis of Medicago truncatula. The yeast one-hybrid assay indicated that FtWD40 had transcriptional activation activities. During florescence, FtWD40 was highly expressed in flowers compared to other organs. Furthermore, its overexpression in tobacco resulted in a remarkable deepening of petal pigmentation in flowers due to a significant increase in anthocyanins accumulation. Meanwhile, the expression of dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) and anthocyanin synthase (ANS) was upregulated 1.95- and 1.56-fold, respectively. In contrast, the expression level was lower for flavonol synthase (FLS) in the transgenic lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of a WD40 transcription factor (FtWD40) from tartary buckwheat that controls the anthocyanin pathway.",

Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the first key enzyme involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Here, three putative CHS genes (designated as FtCHS1 (GU172165), FtCHS2 (KT284884), and FtCHS3 (KT284885) were isolated from tartary buckwheat. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that FtCHS1 and FtCHS2 each contained one intron of 444 bp and 157 bp, respectively. FtCHS3 included two introns, one of 86 bp and another of 73 bp. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed the FtCHSs expression presented the same pattern in the stems and flowers, with FtCHS1u003eFtCHS3u003eFtCHS2. A different tendency was found in leaves, with FtCHS3u003eFtCHS2u003eFtCHS1. However, there was no direct correlation between the three CHS expression and total flavonoids. Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) performance reveals rutin is the most abundant flavonoid in all tissues, leaves should be the main location for quercetin storage in tartary buckwheat.",

We observed integrated feather degradation over the course of 48 h in basic culture medium while studying the entire process with scanning electron microscopy. Large amounts of ammonia, sulfite, and L-cysteic acid were detected in fermented liquid. In addition, four enzymes (Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, Peptidase T, Serine protease and Cystathionine gamma-synthase) were identified that play an important role in this degradation pathway, all of which were verified with molecular cloning and prokaryotic expression. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate that Cystathionine gamma-synthase secreted by B. subtilis 8 is involved in the decomposition of feather keratin. This study provides new data characterizing the molecular mechanism of feather degradation by bacteria, as well as potential guidance for future industrial utilization of waste keratin.",

        "abstract": "Cellulose is the most abundant and renewable biological resource on earth. As nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce, cellulose is expected to become a major raw material for food, energy, fuel and other products. 1,4-\u03b2-glucosidase (Bgl), as a kind of cellulose, can be degraded cellulose into industrial available glucose. In this study, we constructed mutants of Bgl with enhanced activity based on homology modeling, molecular docking, and the site-directed mutagenesis of target residues to modify spatial positions, steric hindrances, or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity. On the basis of the high-activity mutations were got (N347S and G235\u202fM) by using site-directed mutagenesis and screening methods and introduced in the Pichia pastoris expression system, the enzymatic properties of mutant enzymes were analysed. Assays of the activity of the purified Bgl revealed that the two mutants exhibited increased activity. The pPICZ\u03b1A-G235\u202fM and pPICZ\u03b1A-N347S mutants exhibited a >33.4% and 44.8% increase in specific activity respectively, with similar pH, temperature and metal ion requirements, compared to wild-type Bgl. These findings would be good foundation for improving production properties of Bgl in the future.",

        "abstract": "We previously constructed three recombinant phyA mutant strains (PP-NP-8, PP-NP-6A and I44E/T252R-PhyA), showing improved catalytic efficiency or thermostability of Aspergillus niger N25 phytase, by error-prone PCR or site-directed mutagenesis. In this study, directed evolution and site-directed mutagenesis were further applied to improve the modified phytase properties. After one-round error-prone PCR for phytase gene of PP-NP-6A, a single transformant, T195L/Q368E/F376Y, was obtained with the significant improvements in catalytic efficiency and thermostability. The phytase gene of T195L/Q368E/F376Y, combined with the previous mutant phytase genes of PP-NP-6A, PP-NP-8 and I44E/T252R-PhyA, was then sequentially modified by DNA shuffling. Three genetically engineered strains with desirable properties were then obtained, namedQ172R, Q172R/K432R andQ368E/K432R. Among them, Q172R/K432R showed the highest thermostability with the longest half-life and the greatest remaining phytase activity after heat treatment, while Q368E/K432R showed the highest catalytic activity. Five substitutions (Q172R, T195L, Q368E, F376Y, K432R) identified from random mutagenesis were added sequentially to the phytase gene of PP-NP-6A to investigate how the mutant sites influence the properties of phytase. Characterization and structural analysis demonstrated that these mutations could produce cumulative or synergistic improvements in thermostability or catalytic efficiency of phytase.",

Knowledge of the final fruit size of buckwheat is critical to its yield increase. In this study, the fruit development of two species of Tartary buckwheat in the  was analyzed. During fruit development, the size/weight, the contents of auxin (AUX)/abscisic acid (ABA), the number of cells, and the changes of embryo were measured and observed; and the two fruit materials were compared to determine the related mechanisms that affected fruit size and the potential factors that regulated the final fruit size. The early events during embryogenesis greatly influenced the final fruit size, and the difference in fruit growth was primarily due to the difference in the number of cells, implicating the effect of cell division rate. Based on our observations and recent reports, the balance of AUX and ABA might be the key factor that regulated the cell division rate. They induced the response of auxin response factor 2 () and downstream small auxin upstream RNA () through hormone signaling pathway to regulate the fruit size of Tartary buckwheat. Further, through the induction of fruit expansion by exogenous auxin,  was significantly downregulated. The  is a potential target for molecular breeding or gene editing.",

The recent publication of the whole-genome sequence of tartary buckwheat enables us to study the tissue and expression profile of the  gene on a genome-wide basis. In this study, 20  () genes were identified and renamed according to the chromosomal distribution of the  genes. The results showed that the  genes belonged to the related sister pair, and the chromosomal map showed that the duplication of  was related to the duplication of the chromosome blocks. The duplication of some  genes shows conserved intron/exon structure, which is different from other genes, suggesting that the function of these genes may be diverse. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis exhibited distinct expression patterns of  genes in various tissues and in response to exogenous auxin during fruit development. In this study, 20  genes were identified, and the structure, evolution, and expression patterns of the proteins were studied. This systematic analysis laid a foundation for the further study of the functional characteristics of the  genes and for the improvement of tartary buckwheat crops.",

        "abstract": "Auxin signaling plays an important role in plant growth and development. It responds to various developmental and environmental events, such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, shoot elongation, tropical growth, lateral root formation, flower and fruit development, tissue and organ architecture, and vascular differentiation. However, there has been little research on the Auxin Response Factor (ARF) genes of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), an important edible and medicinal crop. The recent publication of the whole-genome sequence of tartary buckwheat enables us to study the tissue and expression profile of the FtARF gene on a genome-wide basis. In this study, 20 ARF (FtARF) genes were identified and renamed according to the chromosomal distribution of the FtARF genes. The results showed that the FtARF genes belonged to the related sister pair, and the chromosomal map showed that the duplication of FtARFs was related to the duplication of the chromosome blocks. The duplication of some FtARF genes shows conserved intron/exon structure, which is different from other genes, suggesting that the function of these genes may be diverse. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis exhibited distinct expression patterns of FtARF genes in various tissues and in response to exogenous auxin during fruit development. In this study, 20 FtARF genes were identified, and the structure, evolution, and expression patterns of the proteins were studied. This systematic analysis laid a foundation for the further study of the functional characteristics of the ARF genes and for the improvement of tartary buckwheat crops.",

        "title": "644. Decreased Generation and Cytotoxic Function of Adenovirus-Specific CD8 T Cells in Both CD28 and FasL Deficient Mice",
        "abstract": "The development of conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) has presented a new platform for cancer gene therapy. The relative contribution of CRAd-related toxicity, and the cytotoxic immune response, especially the antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, in tumor cell killing is unclear. The anti-CRAd CTL may destroy tumor cells by specific killing; on the other hand, the spread of viral progeny may be limited by the clearance of infected cells. A better understanding of the effector mechanism of the CTL response would have implications in design of adenovirus-derived vectors, in particular, the potent CRAds. Previous studies indicated that FasL and TNF- but not perforin, play a central role in immune-mediated adenoviral vector clearance, whereas CD28 is thought to be a critical molecule for the generation of effector cells. However, it has been difficult to clearly distinguish effector cell generation from its function due to the inability to specifically recognize Ad-specific CTLs. To investigate the effector mechanisms directly, we employed two novel approaches: tetramer staining and an antigen specific in vivo CTL assay. The Db-E1Bp MHC-I tetramer, that recognizes the immunodominant epitope of Ad E1B (192 VNIRNCCYI) is the first Ad-mouse tetramer. B6 mice, CD28KO mice and FasL deficient gld mice which are all on the H-2b background, as well as D2 mice (H-2d), were immunized with 4108 i.u. of wild type Ad5. Eight days later, target cells from syngeneic mice were labeled with high concentration of CFSE (2M; CFSEHi) and pulsed with E1Bp, or labeled with low concentration of CFSE (0.2M; CFSELo), but unpulsed. Immunized mice were then adoptively transferred with identical numbers of CFSEHi and CFSELo cells. After 6 hours, lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen and liver and stained with fluorescent anti-CD8 and anti-CD44 antibodies and the Db-E1Bp tetramer. Flow cytometry results showed that in B6 mice, approximately 33% of the CD8+ T cells in liver and 11% in spleen are Db-E1Bp positive. The E1Bp-specific killing in the spleen of B6 mice was 93% whereas no Db-E1Bp+ CD8+ T cells or E1Bp-specific killing were observed in D2 mice. E1Bp-specific lysis was significantly correlated with the frequency of Db-E1Bp+CD8+ T cells in B6 mice (p<0.01). As expected, CD28 deficient mice exhibited an 80% reduction in generation of Db-E1Bp+CD8+ efffector T cells and E1Bp specific killing efficiency was reduced by 65% compared to B6 mice. Surprisingly, the E1Bp-specific killing efficiency in gld mice was only minimally reduced by 25% compared to B6 mice. There was also a 25% decrease in generation of Db-E1Bp+CD8+ T cells in gld mice. However, the specific cytotoxicity of individual CTL in both CD28KO and gld mice was compromised in that the percentage lysis per cell was lower than in B6. Our results indicate 1) CD28 plays an important role in generation of the specific CTL response to Ad; 2) FasL-dependent pathway plays a minor role in CTL response and also affects generation of CTLs; and 3) tetramer analysis of Ad-specific CTL and specific in vivo CTL assay can be used to distinguish generation and effector functions of CTLs.",

        "abstract": "IL-12 has been reported to affect thymic T cell selection, but the role of IL-12 in thymic involution has not been studied. We found that in vivo, IL-12b knockout (IL-12b(-/-)) mice exhibited accelerated thymic involution compared with wild-type (WT) B6 mice. This is characterized by an increase in thymocytes with the early development stage phenotype of CD25(-)CD44(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) in aged IL-12b(-/-) mice. Histologically, there were accelerated degeneration of thymic extracellular matrix and blood vessels, a significantly decreased thymic cortex/medulla ratio, and increased apoptotic cells in aged IL-12b(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. There was, however, no apparent defect in thymic structure and thymocyte development in young IL-12(-/-) mice. These results suggest the importance of IL-12 in maintaining thymic integrity and function during the aging process. Surprisingly, in WT B6 mice, there was no age-related decrease in the levels of IL-12 produced from thymic dendritic cells. Stimulation of thymocytes with IL-12 alone also did not enhance the thymocyte proliferative response in vitro. IL-12, however, provided a strong synergistic effect to augment the IL-7 or IL-2 induced thymocyte proliferative response, especially in aged WT and IL-12b(-/-) mice. Our data strongly support the role of IL-12 as an enhancement cytokine, which acts through its interactions with other cytokines to maintain thymic T cell function and development during aging.",

        "title": "990. In Vivo Analysis of Adenovirus Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Response in CD28, PD-1, Fas Ligand or Perforin Deficient Mice",
        "abstract": "Adenovirus (Ad) has been extensively studied as gene delivery vectors in gene therapy as well as vaccine carriers. The cell-mediate cytotoxicity induced by Ad is of great interest in both applications. However, the mechanism underlying Ad-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and effector function remains unclear. To address this problem, we utilized an MHC I tetramer, Db-E1Bp, and an in vivo CTL assay to examine the role of CD28, and PD-1, an inhibitory member of B7:CD28 family, as well as perforin, FasL and TNF|[alpha]| in generation and/or function of Ad-specific CTLs. Eight days after Ad infection, 1% of CD8+ cells in spleen were Db-E1Bp+ in CD28KO mice, compared to 9.3% in WT mice. The target cell killing efficiencies are also reduced by 77% and 80% in the spleen and liver of CD28KO mice, respectively, compared to those of WT mice. To distinguish between the defects in CTL generation and effector function in CD28KO mice, a plot of the number of Db- E1Bp+ CTLs and the E1Bp-specific target cell lysis was compared to that of WT mice. The results indicate that two out of the three CD28KO mice exhibited lower killing efficiency per cell compared with that of WT mice. (Fig. 1) Surprisingly, there was a 56% decrease in the generation of Db-E1Bp+ cells in PD-1-/- mice compared to WT mice, but the killing efficiency of E1Bp-specific target cells remained the same as in WT mice. The expression of CD28 on CD8+ T cells exhibit a direct effect on CTL activation, since there was no defect in generation or function of Db-E1Bp+CD8+ T cells in CD4+ depleted mice. Perforin deficient (Prf-/-) mice exhibited 70% target cell lysis compared to 98% in WT mice, whereas the number of Ad-specific CTLs remained the same as in WT mice. In contrast , the generation of Ad-specific CD8 T cells in FasL deficient mice was significantly reduced by 62% and 50% in the spleen and liver, respectively, but the specific lysis were equivalent to that of WT mice. The killing efficiency in Prf-/- mice were further reduced to 37% in killing of Fas- deficient cells, but remained the same in killing of cells from TNFR1-/-TNFR2-/- mice. These results indicate that CD28 is necessary for an optimal CTL response and PD-1 provides positive signals to CD8 T cells in response to Ad infection. In WT mice, the CTL activity is mediated mainly by perforin. In the absence of perforin, FasL but not TNF|[alpha]|, produced by the CTLs appears to mediate the Ad-specific killing of target cells.

        "abstract": "Despite the many potential advantages of Ad vectors for vaccine application, the full utility of current Ad vaccines may be limited by the host anti-vector immune response. Direct incorporation of antigens into the adenovirus capsid offers a new and exciting approach for vaccination strategies; this strategy exploits the inherent antigenicity of the Ad vector. Critical to exploiting Ad in this new context is the placement of antigenic epitopes within the major Ad capsid protein, hexon. In our current study we illustrate that we have the capability to place a range of antigenic epitopes within Ad5 capsid protein hexon hypervariable regions (HVRs) 2 or 5, thus producing viable Ad virions. Our data define the maximal incorporation size at HVR2 or HVR5 as it relates to identical antigenic epitopes. In addition, this data suggests that Ad5 HVR5 is more permissive to a range of insertions. Most importantly, repeated administration of our hexon-modified viruses resulted in a secondary anti-antigen response, whereas minimal secondary effect was present after administration of Ad5 control. Our study describes antigen placement and optimization within the context of the capsid incorporation approach of Ad vaccine employment, thereby broadening this new methodology.",

We utilized an E1-deleted adenovirus (Ad) vector to deliver the murine interleukin-12 (IL-12) gene in order to enhance the antivirus CTL response. Wild-type (WT) Ad was administered 3 days after AdIL-12 treatment, when IL-12 production was at its peak and the anti-Ad antibody response had not yet begun to develop. Before receiving AdIL-12 treatment, aged (18 month old) mice exhibited a 58% decrease in the number of virus-specific CTLs, and a 30% decrease in in vivo CTL activity as compared to young (2 month old) mice. After AdIL-12 treatment, aged mice displayed a greater increase in IL-12 expression and endogenous production of interferon-gamma than observed in young mice. When infected with WT Ad, these AdIL-12-treated aged mice exhibited an increased in vivo CTL response and an in vitro proliferative response that was similar to those in young mice. The frequencies of occurrence of D(b)-E1Bp(+)CD8(+) T cells in the spleen, liver, and lung in aged mice were higher than the corresponding values in young mice. These results indicate that IL-12 treatment significantly promotes the virus-specific CTL response in aged mice and, more importantly, specifically targets the virally infected organs, such as the liver and lung, promoting enhanced CTL activity against the virus.",

        "abstract": "The use of Adenovirus (Ad) as a gene delivery vector is limited by transient gene expression due to the host cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and innate responses. We and others have shown that the cytotoxic response to Ad is only partially inhibited by administration of Ad to mutant mice deficient in producing a cytotoxic immune response, or by treatment with TNF inhibitors. However, analysis of the specific CTL response to Ad has not been possible due to the lack of reagents that recognize the rearranged T cell receptor expressed on Ad-specific cytotoxic T cells. We therefore developed a tetramer that recognizes the immunodominant epitope of E1B (192 VNIRNCCYI), referred to as E1Bp, in the context of class Ib MHC. The tetramer consists of H2-Db, 2-microglobulin and the peptide epitope, and is referred to as Db-E1Bp. First, to test the specificity of this peptide-MHC complex, C57BL/6 (H-2b; B6) mice were injected with 8108i.u. of wild type (wt) Ad5. As a control, wt Ad5 injected DBA/2 (H-2d; D2) were analyzed. Lymphocytes (105 )isolated 8 days later from spleen or liver were restimulated with E1Bp in vitro and analyzed for IFN- production by an ELISPOT assay. There was a significant increase in spots (6 and 63 spots, respectively) compared to cells stimulated with human influenza virus peptide M1(58 GILGFVFTL) (0 spot, p<0.01). Next, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spleen cells and liver lymphocytes from Ad-infected B6 and D2 mice were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with fluorescent anti-CD8, anti-CD44 antibodies and the Db-E1Bp tetramer. Approximately 33%, 11% and 7% of CD8+ T cells in liver, spleen and peripheral blood were Db-E1Bp positive, respectively. Virtually all (>98%) of the Db-E1Bp+CD8+ T cells are CD44+. No Db-E1Bp+CD8+ T cells were found in immunized D2 or na\u00efve B6 mice. To determine peptide-specific lysis of target cells in vivo, we labeled target cells from syngeneic mice with either high (2M; CFSEHi) or low (0.2M; CFSELo) concentration of CFSE and then pulsed CFSEHi cells with E1Bp and CFSELo cells remained unpulsed. Target cells were adoptively transferred into B6 or D2 mice that were challenged 8 days earlier with wt Ad5, and the percentage of specific killing was determined 6 hours later. As a peptide specificity control, CFSEHi cells pulsed with M1 peptide and unpulsed CFSELo cells were transferred to identically immunized B6 mice. E1Bp-specific lysis was significantly increased in B6 mice compared to control mice or immunized D2 mice (p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between E1Bp-specific lysis and the frequency of Db-E1Bp+ CD8+ T cells in B6 mice (p<0.01). We next used these methods to measure the decreased Ad-specific CTL response in aged mice. Compared with 2-mo-old mice, there was a 30% decrease in killing efficiency in 18-mo-old mice and a 58% decrease in Db-E1Bp+CD8+ T cells. Our results indicate that this tetramer is novel, sensitive and specific tool to detect and follow the E1Bp-specific CTL response against Ad infection.",

Less attention has been paid to the non-immune factors that may maintain the pool of na\u00efve CD8 T cells. Here, we analyzed the status of the na\u00efve CD8 T-cell population in healthy nonagenarians (>or=90-year-old), old (60-79-year-old), and young (20-34-year-old) subjects. Na\u00efve CD8 T cells were defined as CD28(+)CD95(-) as this phenotype showed a strong co-expression of the CD45RA(+), CD45RO(-), and CD127(+) phenotypes. Although there was an age-associated decline in the percentage of CD28(+)CD95(-) CD8 T cells, the healthy nonagenarians maintained a pool of na\u00efve CD28(+)CD95(-) cells that contained T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC)(+) cells. The percentages of na\u00efve CD28(+)CD95(-) CD8 T cells in the nonagenarians correlated with the sera levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and leptin. Higher levels of triiodothyronine (T3) negatively correlated with the accumulation of TREC(-)CD28(-)CD95(+) CD8 T cells from nonagenarians. These results suggest a model in which IGFBP3, leptin and T3 act as non-immune factors to maintain a larger pool of na\u00efve CD8 T cells in healthy nonagenarians.",

        "abstract": "Adenovirus has been extensively investigated as one of the most promising gene delivery vectors. One of the major limitations to its application is the generation of a strong CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. However, analysis of the viral specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and the correlation with the elimination of vector and transgene has not been possible due to the lack of a specific method to detect viral antigen-induced CTLs. To identify Adenovirus specific CTLs generated after administration of recombinant adenovirus vectors, we utilized two MHC binding peptide prediction programs, BIMAS and SYFPEITHI, to predict epitope peptides from adenovirus hexon, penton and fiber proteins that are processed and presented by the mouse MHC class I H2-Kb antigen. To test the specificity of the predicted peptides, the specific CTL activity was determined by an in vivo CTL assay and an IFN ELISPOT assay. C57BL/6 (B6; H2b) mice were i.v. injected with 8108i.u of wild type Ad5 through the tail vein. Eight days later, spleen cells from naive B6 mice were labeled with high (2uM; CFSEHi) concentration of CFSE and then pulsed with predicated peptides, respectively, before co-transferred to the wild type Ad5 primed B6 mice (recipient) with identical number of unpulsed CFSELo (0.2uM) cells for in vivo CTL assay. The known immunodominant E1B peptide (AA192\u2013200 VNIRNCCYI ) of Ad was used as a positive control and human flu M1 peptide (AA58\u201366 GILGFVFTL) was used as a negative control. After six hours, spleen cells and liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) were recovered from recipient mice and analyzed by flow cytometry and by the IFN ELISPOT assay. In the spleen of immunized B6 mice, 85.913% of fiber peptide (AA391\u2013399 VGNKNNDKL) pulsed CFSEHi target cells were specifically lysed, compared to 98.25% of E1B positive control peptide pulsed cells and no specific lysis to M1 negative control peptide pulsed cells. There were 20218 spot forming cells (SFC) per 106 liver MNCs in immunized mice that were responsive to fiber peptide (AA391\u2013399 VGNKNNDKL) and 46887 SFC/106 liver MNCs specific for E1B peptide, compared to 1010 SFC/106 liver MNCs specific for M1 peptide. There were no SFCs specific for other predicted peptides and no specific killing in target cells pulsed with other peptides (data not shown). To further confirm the immunogenicity of the fiber peptide in the context of E1-deleted Ad vectors, B6 mice were injected with 109i.u of AdLacZ and then analyzed by ELISPOT assay. There were 10923/106 liver MNCs specific this fiber peptide, whereas no SFCs specific for E1B peptide or M1 peptide. These results indicated that the fiber peptide is a strong immunogenic peptide and the in vivo CTL assay could be used as a sensitive method to measure Ad-specific CTL response to any viral vectors that derived from Ad2 or Ad5 virus. These findings will provide us with a powerful tool for assessing immune response to Ad capsid in the context of gene therapy.",

        "abstract": "Adenoviruses (Ad) have been extensively studied as gene delivery vectors in gene therapy and as vaccine carriers. The cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by Ad is of great interest in both applications. However, the mechanism underlying Ad-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and effector function remains unclear. In this study, we used a novel MHC class I tetramer and an in vivo CTL assay to examine the role of CD28, perforin, Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-alpha in the generation and function of Ad-specific CTLs in vivo. During the primary response, there was a significant defect in both the generation and in vivo effector function of Ad-specific CTLs in CD28-/- mice, but not in CD4+ T cell-depleted mice or CD4-/- mice. The relative role of CTL effector molecules was assayed by in vivo CTL assay in perforin- or FasL-mutant mice, using donor cells from Fas-deficient or TNFR1/TNFR2-deficient mice. The results indicated that the in vivo CTL activity is mediated mainly by perforin. In the absence of perforin, production of FasL, but not TNF-alpha, by the CTLs results in lower level Ad-specific killing of target cells. These results provide important implications concerning the development of safe and effective Ad vectors for gene therapy and vaccines.",

        "abstract": "The immune response to adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) gene therapy using the coagulation factor IX transgene (AAV-F.IX) can lead to either elimination of the vector or production of inhibitor antibodies to the expressed transgene. Interestingly not all individuals treated with F.IX or animal models of AAV-FIX develop such an immune response. AAV-F.IX gene therapy can also elicit a tolerance response, or no immune response to AAV and/or the F.IX transgene. We hypothesize that the combined effects of genetic diversity and multiple redundant pathways lead to a diverse antibody response to AAV and FIX. This was tested using C57BL/6 xDBA/2 (BXD) recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from high responder DBA/2 and low responder C57BL/6 parental mice. To determine the cellular and genetic basis for this response, we analyzed strains of C57BL/6 X DBA/2 (BXD) RI mice derived from high responder, D2, and low responder, B6, parental mice and have observed three response patterns to AAV-F.IX. An immunogenic response was associated with high expression of CD40 and BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) on B cells and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells. This occurred in BXD strains 12, 28, 31, and 33, as well as in D2 strain. A tolerogenic response was associated with development of a CD4+CD25+ T regulatory population. This population was strongly evident in BXD strains 6 and 25 at days 18 and 40, after AAV-F.IX. In certain strains, including BXD strains 8, 19, 22, and 23, exhibited no immune response, which was associated with low CD40 and low BAFF-R on B cells. Genetic linkage analysis revealed a highly significant locus at D12Mit150 (59 cM, LRS=42.1), near the Igh (59 cM) and CD40 binding protein (Traf3) loci (55 cM), and a suggestive locus at D17Mit36 (23 cM, LRS=18.1), near the MHC locus. These results indicate that the antibody response to AAV-F.IX exhibited: (i) a predictable strain-dependent pattern in BXD RI strains; (ii) a correlation with expression of CD40-CD40L, BAFF-BAFF-R, and % of CD4+CD25+ T cells; and (iii) significant linkage to a locus on Chr 12 near the Traf3/Igh locus, and on Chr 17 near the MHC locus.",

        "abstract": "The application of AAV2 or AAV8 vectors for delivery of human coagulation factor IX (hF.IX) is a promising gene therapy for hemophilia B. One major limitation of this therapy is the development of antibodies and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against both the vector capsid and the transgene. We determined the class I and class II MHC peptide epitopes for AAV2, AAV8, and hF.IX after administration of AAV-2-hF.IX or AAV8-hF.IX in H2(b) (C57BL/6), H2(d) (BALB/c), or H2(k) (C3H) strains of mice. The results indicate that the AAV2 capsid peptide AA(373-381), the AAV8 capsid peptide AA(50-58), and the hF.IX transgene peptide AA(311-319) can elicit a CTL response as indicated by an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay and an in vivo CTL assay. Furthermore, a strong H2(k) MHC II-restricted Th1 response can be elicited in C3H mice by the AAV8 capsid peptide AA(126-140) and the hF.IX peptide AA(108-122), whereas a strong Th2 response can be elicited by the AAV2 peptide AA(475-489). These results show that specific CTL responses are generated to both AAV capsid epitopes and hF.IX epitopes after injection of AAV-hF.IX, and MHC class II epitopes derived from AAV-hF.IX promote development of either Th1 or Th2 cells.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a cytokine associated with inflammation, autoimmunity and defense against some bacteria. Here we show that IL-17 can promote autoimmune disease through a mechanism distinct from its proinflammatory effects. As compared with wild-type mice, autoimmune BXD2 mice express more IL-17 and show spontaneous development of germinal centers (GCs) before they increase production of pathogenic autoantibodies. We show that blocking IL-17 signaling disrupts CD4+ T cell and B cell interactions required for the formation of GCs and that mice lacking the IL-17 receptor have reduced GC B cell development and humoral responses. Production of IL-17 correlates with upregulated expression of the genes Rgs13 and Rgs16, which encode regulators of G-protein signaling, and results in suppression of the B cell chemotactic response to the chemokine CXCL12. These findings suggest a mechanism by which IL-17 drives autoimmune responses by promoting the formation of spontaneous GCs.",

        "abstract": "We previously identified that autoreactive B cells from BXD2 mice can be targeted by IL-17, leading to upregulation of the expression of regulators of G-protein signaling (Rgs) genes that facilitated the development of spontaneous germinal centers. Little is known about the signaling pathway used by IL-17 to upregulate RGS. In the current study, we found that IL-17 rapidly activates the canonical NF-kappaB signaling pathway and that BXD2 B cells exhibit higher basal and activated phosphorylated p65 levels than B6 or BXD2-Il17ra(-/-) B cells. Inhibition of p65 phosphorylation downregulated RGS16 expression and abrogated the IL-17-induced chemotactic arrest of B cells in response to CXCL12. Knockdown of TNFR-associated factor 6 or NF-kappaB activator 1 in 70Z/3 pre-B cells led to decreased Rgs16 expression, indicating that both of these two genes are involved in IL-17-mediated activation of NF-kappaB signaling in B cells. These findings identify the signaling pathway regulated by IL-17 to contribute to the development of spontaneous germinal centers in autoimmune BXD2 mice.",

        "title": "140. Primary Adenovirus Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Response Occurs after Viral Clearance and Liver Enzyme Elevation",
        "abstract": "The relative contribution of the specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and innate immune response to the clearance of adenovirus (Ad) and its transgene in the context of gene therapy has been a subject of debate. Transient transgene expression was believed due to the elimination of Ad transduced cells by CTLs. To determine the relative contribution of specific CTL killing of Ad-infected hepatocytes, we have utilized a wild-type Ad5 to study viral clearance from the liver and its associated liver enzyme elevation during a primary immune response. Human Ad5 replicates poorly in mice due to species restriction but induces a dominant CTL response to the E1B peptide (AA192 VNIRNCCYI) associated with mouse class I MHC antigen, H2-Db, in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Thus, Ad5 was used to mimic a low replicative Ad vectors used in humans and an MHC-I tetramer that contains the E1Bp, H2-Db and b2-microglubulin (Db-E1B), was developed and used to detect the Ad-specific CTLs in Ad5-primed mice. After Ad5 infection, the Db-E1B+CD8+T cells were undetectable in the spleen, liver and lung until day 5, and peaked at day 8. At the peak of the CTL response, 8 days post infection, 10% of CD8+ cells in the spleen. Surprisingly, 45% in the liver and 55% in the lung of the CD8+ T cells were Db-E1B+, indicating that most CD8+ T cells in target tissue are specifically recruited to these sites. Furthermore, nearly 100% of Db-E1B+CD8+ cells were IFN and granzyme-B positive with intracellular staining, indicating that the recruited CD8+CTL exhibit potent killing activity. The E1B-specific in vivo CTL response was detected by the transfer of CFSE-labeled, E1B192 peptide-pulsed target cells from H-2b mice into Ad5-primed syngeneic mice. The magnitude of the in vivo CTL response correlated with the number of Db-E1B+ CTLs in the spleen and liver (r2=0.96, p<0.01). Interestingly, viral DNA genome and E1B mRNA peaked at day 2 and reduced rapidly by day 6 and then maintained at a stable level without significant change 200 days after infection. Viral clearance correlated with the peak liver enzyme response that occurred on day 4, before CTLs became detectable. In contrast, there was no further change in the level of viral DNA genome and E1B mRNA in the liver or lung as a result of the peak CTL response at day 8. Administration of Ad5 to athymic SCID mice induced no CD8 T cells or in vivo specific CTL response against E1B192 peptide, yet viral clearance and liver enzyme response in SCID mice were comparable to those of B6 mice. Taken together, our results suggest that the innate response, but not the CTL response, plays a dominant role in elimination of Ad during a primary response. Stable long-term expression of lower levels of virus and transgene persist for 200 days despite the presence of potent CD8+ CTLs, indicating that they reside in liver cells that are resistant to CTL elimination. These findings will be useful in developing efficient and safe Ad gene therapy protocols.",

        "abstract": "The BXD2 mouse strain spontaneously develops glomerulonephritis and erosive arthritis. The goal of this study was to identify the antigenic target proteins and epitopes and to unravel the mechanisms by which the related conditions arise in BXD2 mice.Individual hybridomas isolated from the spleen of a 10-month-old BXD2 mouse were injected intraperitoneally into nonautoimmune mice for evaluation of pathogenicity of each autoantibody. Autoantigens were immunoprecipitated with the pathogenic autoantibody L3A4. Autoantigens were identified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS. Antigenic epitopes were determined using a high-throughput epitope mapping method.The production of autoantibodies in BXD2 mice occurred in an orderly progression, with peak levels of autoantibodies to nitrotyrosine (NT)-modified enolase, Ro, alpha-actin, and heat-shock proteins (HSPs) preceding peak levels of antihistone, anti-DNA, and rheumatoid factor. Two monoclonal autoantibodies, L3A4 and T56G10, were identified that could induce immune complexes, renal disease, and/or arthritis. Both L3A4 and T56G10 were polyreactive, and each reacted with separate sets of autoantigens. The antigenic targets of L3A4 consisted of NT-modified enolase, ATP5b, alpha-actin, and Hsp70 family proteins including Hspa5 and Hsp74. The antigenic epitopes of NT-modified enolase and Hspa5 exhibited sequence homology and cross-reactivity, suggesting that epitope spreading may occur through a molecular mimicry mechanism.The polyreactivity of autoantibodies that target a novel class of autoantigens may enable these autoantibodies to induce erosive arthritis or glomerulonephritis either by direct pathogenic mechanisms or indirectly via Fc or immune complex deposition.",

There was a higher anti-AAV2 capsid response in B6 compared to D2 mice, with IgG2b being the major isotype separating the high and low responders in these two strains. In contrast, the antibody response to cF.IX was lower than the response to the AAV2 capsid and was limited to the IgG1 isotype in both strains. Genetic linkage analysis of the IgG2b anti-AAV2 antibody response in BXD RI strains revealed a significant locus at D4Mit164 (29 cM, LRS=15.3) and two suggestive loci at D6Mit16 (30.5 cM, LRS=11.2) and D17Mit187 (47.4 cM, LRS=13.1). Genetic linkage analysis of the IgG1 anti-cF.IX antibody response revealed a suggestive locus at D1Mit218 (67 cM, LRS=14.1). Significant epistatic interaction was found between two loci (D8Mit45 and D16Mit47; LOD=6.54) for anti-AAV2 and two other loci (D5Mit348 and D15Mit161; LOD=7.66) for anti-cF.IX. These results indicate that multiple genetic loci independently regulate the isotype-specific antibody response to the AAV2 capsid and the cF.IX transgene.",

FasL was toxic, however, and controlled regulation of FasL was not achieved. Here we describe an improved approach to delivering TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in vivo in which collagen II-induced (CII-induced) arthritis-susceptible (CIA-susceptible) DBA/1j mice were treated with CII-pulsed DCs that had been transfected with a novel Ad system. The Ad was engineered to exhibit inducible TRAIL under the control of the doxycycline-inducible (DOX-inducible) tetracycline response element (TRE). Four groups of mice were treated with CII-DC-AdTRAIL+DOX, CII-DC-AdTRAIL (no DOX), CII-DC-AdGFP+DOX, or DC-AdTRAIL+DOX (no CII), beginning 2 weeks after priming with CII in CFA. The incidence of arthritis and infiltration of T cells in the joint was significantly decreased in CII-DC-AdTRAIL+DOX-treated mice. The in vitro splenic T cell proliferative response and induction of IFN-gamma to bovine CII stimulation were also significantly reduced in mice treated with CII-DC-AdTRAIL+DOX. AdTRAIL+DOX was not toxic to DCs or mice but could induce activated T cells to undergo apoptosis in the spleen. Our results suggest that CII-DC-AdTRAIL+DOX cell gene therapy is a safe and effective method for inhibiting the development of CIA.",

        "abstract": "The nonagenarian population by definition represents individuals who have demonstrated success in aging. We determined the status of CD8(+) T-cell senescence in nonagenarians by analyzing the expression of CD28 and Fas (CD95), and analyzing activation and activation-induced cell death (AICD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from three groups of subjects: adults (20-64-year-old), older adults (65-89-year-old), and nonagenarians (>or=90-year-old). PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (10 microg/ml). The cells were labeled with conjugated antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, CD28, CD45RO, and Fas, and were analyzed by FACS((R)). There was a strong negative correlation of the percentage of CD28(+)Fas(-) CD8(+) T-cells with the age of each individual prior to stimulation in vitro (R(2)=0.76, p<0.0001). Compared to other biomarkers (CD28(-), CD28(-)CD45RO(+), and Fas(+)) that have been associated with CD8(+) T-cell aging, the loss of the CD28(+)Fas(-) CD8(+) T-cell population exhibited the strongest correlation with the individual's chronologic age. After stimulation with PHA, there was a decrease in the percentage of CD8(+) T-cells from individual >or=65-year-old that expresses both CD28(+) and Fas(+) at day 3. Surprisingly, the AICD response of CD8(+) T-cells at day 7 in the nonagenarians was higher than that in the other two groups. These results suggest that successful aging does not prevent development of the senescent phenotype of unstimulated CD8(+) T cells, but is associated with preservation of CD8 T cell functions including activation and AICD. Increased AICD may result in enhanced rejuvenation capacity of T cells and limit the impact of aging on T cell function in nonagenarians.",

        "abstract": "In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type I IFNs promote induction of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) and can drive B cells to produce autoantibodies. Little is known about the expression of distinct type I IFNs in lupus, particularly high-affinity IFN-\u03b2. Single-cell analyses of transitional B cells isolated from SLE patients revealed distinct B cell subpopulations, including type I IFN producers, IFN responders, and mixed IFN producer/responder clusters. Anti-Ig plus TLR3 stimulation of SLE B cells induced release of bioactive type I IFNs that could stimulate HEK-Blue cells. Increased levels of IFN-\u03b2 were detected in circulating B cells from SLE patients compared with controls and were significantly higher in African American patients with renal disease and in patients with autoantibodies. Together, the results identify type I IFN-producing and -responding subpopulations within the SLE B cell compartment and suggest that some patients may benefit from specific targeting of IFN-\u03b2.",

        "abstract": "Background  Abnormal selection of self-reactive B cells has been shown to occur at the transitional B cell stage, the tolerance checkpoint II, in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study investigated novel mechanisms of IFN-beta (IFNb)-dependent tolerance loss of transitional B cells.  Materials and methods  Using a La-peptide specific tetramer, La13-27 autoreactive B cells from the spleens of B6 and autoimmune BXD2 mice were analysed for the development of CD93+ transitional B cell subsets. Mice were treated with IFNa, IFNb, or anti-IFNAR to induce or block type I IFNs. qRT-PCR was used to determine expression of IFN and genes involved in type I IFN induction and responses. IFNB1 expression in human SLE patients and mouse B cells was determined by intracellular flow cytometry analysis.  Results  Enhanced IFNAR provided a needed signal to promote transitional (CD93+) autoreactive (La13-27+) B cell maturation and survival in BXD2 mice. IFNb, compared to IFNa, exhibited a more potent effect to stimulate BXD2 transitional B cells. Surprisingly, there was abnormal elevation of IFNb in transitional T1 B cells of BXD2 mice. Autocrine production and stimulation by type I IFN was necessary for optimal anti-IgM-induced transitional B cell activation in purified B cells from BXD2, and the effect was abrogated by IFNAR blockade. Despite the higher expression of IFNb, there was lower expression of genes involved in nucleic acid sensing and TLR pathway (Rig1, Mda5, Pkr, Zbp1, Irf3, and Irf7) in BXD2 T1 B cells, compared to B6 T1 B cells, suggesting non-conventional induction of Ifnb in BXD2 T1 B cells. Interestingly, in vivo immune complex stimulation enhanced Ifnb levels in BXD2 T1 cells. Further, BXD2 but not B6 T1 B cells were susceptible to anti-IgM induction of IFNb. Higher expression of Ifnb1 was also found in La(+) B cells compared to La(-) B cells, suggesting that BCR stimulation may provide a signal to enhance type I IFN expression in BXD2 B cells. Similar to the mouse finding, elevation of IFNb was identified in 9G4+ transitional B cells from SLE patient, compared to B cells from healthy controls.  Conclusions  These results suggest that transitional B cells from BXD2 mice exhibit autocrine stimulation by intracellular IFNb. In combination with BCR signalling, this facilitates survival and maturation of autoreactive B cells that otherwise will be deleted. Identification of the molecular mechanism leading to INFb autocrine stimulation in transitional B cells should unveil new pathways for development of autoreactive B cells.

        "abstract": "We recently identified that lupus prone BXD2 mice exhibited defective clearance of apoptotic debris.  I  n vivo  administration of excessive autologous apoptotic cells lead to elevation of IgG anti-La 13-27  responses in BXD2 mice but not normal B6 mice, suggesting chronic self-antigen stimulation plus B-cell tolerance defects may be related to the IgG anti-La 13-27  responses. To interrogate if there was abnormal maturation of anti-La 13-27  B cells in naive BXD2 mice, a recently developed La 13-27  tetramer was used with CD80 and PD-L2 co-staining to reveal that there was a significantly higher frequency of memory CD80 + PD-L2 +  La 13-27  +  B cells in BXD2 (17%), compared to that in B6 (3%) mouse spleens. Tetramer analysis of CD93 +  transitional B cells showed that there was an abnormal skewing of the La 13-27  +  T3 population, but not T1 or T2 B cells, in BXD2 (40%) compared to that in B6 (18%) mouse spleens. Survival of anti-La 13-27  producing B cells in BXD2 but not B6 mice was associated with increased protein kinase C (PKC) activation, as stimulation of B cells with PMA+ionomycin which promotes survival of BCR stimulated transitional B cells resulted in an increase in IgG. As T3 B cells are considered anergic B cells maintaining self-tolerance through rapid turnover  in vivo , the abnormal expansion of these B cells coupled with increased BCR signaling response in BXD2 mice may present a risk for B-cell tolerance loss to La 13-27 , leading to maturation into IgG secreting cells.",

        "abstract": "The transitional stage of B cell development is a formative stage in the spleen where autoreactive specificities are censored as B cells gain immune competence, but the intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulating survival of transitional stage 1 (T1) B cells are unknown. We report that B cell expression of IFN-\u03b2 is required for optimal survival and TLR7 responses of transitional B cells in the spleen and was overexpressed in T1 B cells from BXD2 lupus-prone mice. Single-cell gene expression analysis of B6  Ifnb  +/+  versus B6  Ifnb \u2013\u2044\u2013   T1 B cells revealed heterogeneous expression of  Ifnb  in wild-type B cells and distinct gene expression patterns associated with endogenous IFN-\u03b2. Single-cell analysis of BXD2 T1 B cells revealed that  Ifnb  is expressed in early T1 B cell development with subsequent upregulation of  Tlr7  and  Ifna1 . Together, these data suggest that T1 B cell expression of IFN-\u03b2 plays a key role in regulating responsiveness to external factors.",

        "abstract": "Background  Increased type I interferon (IFN) has been shown to affect survival and activation of B cells in SLE. This study investigated novel mechanisms of endogenous production and autocrine activity of IFN\u03b2 in SLE B cells at the single-cell level.  Methods  IFN\u03b2 in B cells from SLE patients was analyzed using t-SNE platform based high dimensional flow cytometry. Intracellular IFN\u03b2 expression was visualized and analyzed by super-resolution confocal imaging and ImageStream analysis. Single cell gene expression analysis was carried out using the Fluidigm/BioMark system for targeted expression of low abundance genes, and the 10x Chromium platform for unbiased transcriptome analysis of up to 4,000 B cells per subject. Functional production of type I IFNs by B cells was analyzed using a human type I IFNs SEAP reporter HEK293 cell line.  Results  High dimension flow cytometry analysis identified intracellular IFN\u03b2 expression in pDCs, B cells, and CD4 T cells. B-cell endogenous IFN\u03b2 was required for optimal  in vitro  BCR and TLR7-induced activation and survival of B cells. Using a Fluidigm targeted-gene approach, B cells could be divided into type I IFN expressing ( IFN +) or type I IFN stimulated gene ( ISG +) subpopulations, suggesting B cells not only respond to type I IFNs but also express type I IFNs including  IFNB  and different  IFNA  genes.  TLR7  and  TLR3  were mainly expressed by  IFN  +cells whereas  TLR9  was mainly expressed by  ISG  +B cells. The production of functional IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b1 protein by single B cells from SLE subjects and was verified using a novel alkaline phosphatase live staining of HEK-blue reporter cells. There was enhanced IFNAR signaling by reporter cells in direct contact with SLE B cells which was blocked by anti-IFN\u03b2 and anti-IFN\u03b1. Interesting, anti-Ig crosslinking was required for optimal B-cell endogenous type I IFNs to stimulate responder cells. Unbiased single cells transcriptome analysis of SLE B cells using the 5\u2019 10X Chromium platform and Loupe V(D)J Browser indicated that gene clusters in type I IFN expressing or responding SLE B cells exhibited unique heavy- and light-chain gene expression repertoires.  Conclusion  (i) B cells are an important source of type I IFNs in modulating TLR and BCR responses in SLE; (ii) well-orchestrated and distinct programs in type I expression and responses genes in subsets of B cells, and (iii) distinct pathways of B cell survival and activation based on combined signaling through BCR, TLR, and IFNAR with a distinct BCR heavy- and light-chain repertoire.

        "title": "AA-05 B cell intrinsic IFN\u03b2 is associated with autoantibodies and active renal disease in SLE",
        "abstract": "Background  Dysregulated responses to type I interferons (IFNs) is a hallmark of autoreactive B cell development in SLE patients. High sera levels of type I IFN protein were recently shown to occur in the absence of increased circulating pDCs and in the absence of increased pDC IFNs, suggesting the likelihood of other important sources of type I IFN that may act on B cells. The present study determined the cellular source of IFN\u03b2 and its association with disease activities in SLE.  Methods  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 31 SLE patients meeting ACR 1997 revised criteria for SLE and 9 healthy controls. Intracellular IFN\u03b2 was determined using flow cytometry with FITC-anti-IFN\u03b2 mAb. Comprehensive clinical data was recorded for each SLE subject and the clinical data and laboratory analysis of B-cell intracellular IFN\u03b2 expression were collected in a double-blind fashion.  Results  IFN\u03b2 was detected in various cell types including CD4 T cells, B cells and pDCs in PBMCs of SLE patients. Endogenous IFN\u03b2 in B cells was significantly higher than endogenous IFN\u03b2 in CD4 T cells and were equivalent to that seen in pDCs. Within B cells, there was a significant increase in endogenous IFN\u03b2 in all B cell subpopulations of SLE patients compared to healthy controls. The most significant increase was found in the CD27 + IgD \u2013  memory subpopulation. B-cell endogenous IFN\u03b2 was not a result of B-cell uptake of exogenous IFN\u03b2 as coculture of SLE B cells with HEK293 reporter cells resulted in induction of interferon stimulatory genes as determined by the secreted alkaline phosphatase assay. This was further blocked by an anti-IFN\u03b2 neutralization antibody. Interestingly B-cell endogenous IFN\u03b2 was highly correlated with clinical disease including renal disease and autoantibodies including anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm and anti-SSA. Strikingly, the highest correlation of IFN\u03b2 with clinical manifestations was observed in African-American patients. B-cell IFN\u03b2 expression was significantly correlated with CD19 lo CD38 hi CD27 +  plasma cell formation.  Conclusion  Intracellular IFN\u03b2 production by B cells is a novel and important B-cell intrinsic factor that may be essential for B-cell development into autoantibody producing B cells. The present work suggests a need for future human lupus studies into type I IFN dysregulation that pioneer beyond the view of pDC produced IFN\u03b1. These results also provided a mechanistic basis for development of more effective therapies to target the high-affinity IFN\u03b2 or the enhanceosome components that promote its induction in a subgroup of lupus patients.

        "abstract": "Objective: To analyze the constituents of the essential oil extracted from the rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong. cultivated in \"GAP base for Chinese medicinal materials of China\" (GAP demonstrative base of L. chuanxiong. in Dujiangyan City of China), and to provide scientific foundation for the quality control and standard establishment of ones. Method: The essential oil was extracted by water-steam distillation and separated by GC capillary column chromatography. The components were determined with normalization method, and identified by GC-MS and co-artificial searches. Result: One hundred forty-two chromatographic peaks were isolated, among them sixty-two components were identified, which was composed of 87. 36% of the total essential oil. The mass fragmentation rules of phthalides and its derivatives in the essential oil were summarized, which primarily underwent two electron impact fragmentation pathways: side-chain cleavage with losses of alkenes/alkanes and ring-opening with elimination of H2O followed by losses of CO. On the basis of these rules, the plane structure of 4, 5-dihydro-3, 1\u2032-dihydroxy-3- pentylphtharide as a new compound was determined. Conclusion: The main components of the essential oil extracted from the rhizomes of L. chuanxiong cultivated in \"GAP Demonstrative Base of L. chuanxiong in Dujiangyan City of China\" were phthalides and its derivatives. 4,5-Dihydro-3,1\u2032- dihydroxy-3-pentylphthalide was a new compound.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of the chemical constituents of the whole herbs of Crossostephium chinense on insulin secretion in rat islets. Method: Islets were isolated from rat pancreata, cultured in vitro, and measured by color signals of dithizone stained digestion solution for detection of pancreatic islets. The morphological observation of islets was carried out by inverted microscope. The effects of test compounds, scopoletin (1), scopolin (2), tanacetin (3), quercetagetin-3,6,7-trimethylether (4) and 5-O-methyl-myo-inositol (5) isolated from the whole herbs of C. chinense, on the insulin secreting level from islets were compared with those of glybenclamide as a positive control substances, and the difference in insulin secreting level from islets between the presence and absence of test compounds was assayed. Result: There was no difference in basal insulin secretion before and after 2 h incubation period of rat islets. The islets treated with quercetagetin-3,6,7- trimethylether have about 2-fold higher insulin secreting level (P < 0.01) compared a normal control group. The islets treated with 5-O-methyl-myo-inositol have about 1.5-fold higher insulin secreting level (P < 0.05) compared to a normal control group. Whereas the islets treated with scopoletin show about 1.9-fold lower basal insulin secreting level (P < 0.05) than a normal control group. Conclusion: In this paper the developed cultivation method of isolated pancreatic islets from rat can be used as a kind of islet-based drug screening model for diabetes mellitus in vitro. Quercetagetin-3,6,7-trimethylether and 5-O-methyl-myo-inositol could enhance rat islet insulin secretion and further in vivo studies are needed to clarify the nature of such an observation. However, scopletin suppress rat islet insulin secretion.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the chemical constituents of 70% aqueous ethanol extract from the whole plant of Crossostephium chinoise for inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase. Method: A bioactivity-guided isolation and purification process was used to identify the alpha-glucosidase activity inhibiting components of the whole plant of C. chinense. The dried whole plants were extracted with 70% aqueous ethanol. The extract was suspended in water and then further fractionated successively with cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, and normal butanol, and tested for their inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase in vitro. The chemical structures of isolated compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods including NMR and MS, and comparison with data of authentic samples. All of compounds were assayed for their inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase in vitro. Result: The ethyl acetate and water layer fractions showed the strong inhibitory activity, and were subjected to column chromatography over the various stationary phases. Tricetin 3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trimethylether (1), scopoletin (2), tanacetin, hispidulin (3), apometzgerin (4), chrysoeriol (5), quercetagetin 3,6, 7-trimethylether (6), selagin (7), scopolin (8), and quercetagetin-3,6- dimethylether (9) were isolated and characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. Among them, compounds 2,3, 5-7 and 9 for inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase with IC50 (\u03bcmol\u00b7L-1) values of (34.36\u00b12.06), (146.28 \u00b1 12.44), (246.26 \u00b1 8.73), (74. 06 \u00b13.83), (42.19 \u00b1 5.25) and (136.20 \u00b1 25.73), respectively, were assayed as the active components. A positive drug, acarbose, showed the inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase with IC50 value of (489.25 \u00b1 38.55) \u03bcmol\u00b7L-1 in the same assay conditions with the above test compounds. The IC50 values of compounds 1, 4, 8 and tanacetin were all more than 1 000 \u03bcmol\u00b7L -1. Conclution: The compounds 5 and 9 were isolated from the genus Crossostephium for the first time. The compounds 2, 3, 5-7, and 9 showed the strong inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase in vitro in the simple competitive manner. The results indicated that these compounds may be involved in the treatment of diabetes in the whole plant of C. chinense for human.",

So occurring mechanism, effect factors and suppression methods of grinding vibration are always hot-point research. WC-Co coating material is used widely now, due to its performance of high rigidity and high abradability. Meanwhile, WC-Co coating is hard to machining. At present, there is still not report about research on precision grinding of WC-Co coating from the angle of grinding vibration. Therefore, related grinding experiment will be performed, and the signals of grinding vibration will be collected and processed from time-domain and frequency-domain in this paper. Results of experiment show no grinding vibration occurred under the condition of selected parameters, and ensure the grinding surface quality.",

By controlling the worktable to rotate in x-y plane, the superposition between the rotary surface of the grinding wheel and the normal vector of the curve was realized.

        "abstract": "A novel multi-metal-layer dipole antenna, in which some identical dipoles are deployed on different metal layers and effectively connected by the feeding and shorting vias, is proposed for wireless inter-/intraconnects. An accurate equivalent model is also presented for better understanding of its physical fundamentals. Simulations show that a six-layer dipole typically has a size reduction of 13.0% and a bandwidth enhancement of 35.3% compared with the corresponding one-layer dipole. An example chip carrying one- and six-layer dipoles was also fabricated through a 0.18-\u00c2\u00bfm mixed-mode process and on-wafer characterized with full two-port measurements. The experimental results show that further size reduction and bandwidth enhancement could be obtained due to the loadings of lossy vias in six-layer dipoles, and the transmission coefficients of multilayer dipoles could also be improved for the in-phase additive contributions of dipoles on different layers. The propagation mechanisms of wireless intraconnects were evaluated and discussed with the assistance of path-loss coefficient \u00c2\u00bf, and it is revealed that the propagation is mostly through the surface waves when the dipole operate far below its resonant frequency, while the space-wave propagation would dominate when approaching the resonant frequency.",

Detailed study on parameters is presented. Both numerical and experimental results show that a circular disk monopole with properly-designed curved or hexagonal grounds would have better pulse preserving performance than the identical monopole with rectangular ground. The improvement of the correlation factors in the x-y plane introduced by the curved and hexagonal grounds is about 6.4% and 8.1% on average, respectively. This optimization process won't bring any size or cost increase to the printed monopole antennas, and the improvement of pulse preserving capabilities is quite discernible, which appears to be a significant improvement over printed monopole antennas.",

In order to reduce the number of microstrip patches in the UWB log-periodic arrays, a large scale factor k = 1.1 was firstly reported and proved to be highly effective. Furthermore, instead of using an absorbing terminal loading, a novel loss-free compensating stub was proposed. Detailed parameters study was also presented for better understanding of the proposed antennas. The impedance bandwidth (measured VSWR < 2.5) of an example antenna with only 11 elements is from 2.26-6.85 GHz with a ratio of about 3.03:1. Both numerical and experimental results show that the proposed antenna has stable directional radiation patterns, very low-profile and low fabrication cost, which are suitable for various broadband applications.",

According to the relative orientations of the linear-polarized source antenna and the corrugated-reflectors, the problem could be divided into H and E cases. Their fundamental differences and design guidelines are discussed in detail. A novel composite corrugated-reflector based on the combinations of H-type and E-type ones is proposed for the first time, and fully characterized with a UWB source dipole which was optimized in the free space for better comparisons. An example antenna with only 21 mm core profile, composed of a printed UWB dipole, a microstrip balun and a composite corrugated-reflector, has an impedance bandwidth (VSWR < 2.0) of 2.75 GHz to 8.35 GHz. Both numerical and experimental results show that the example antenna also has stable uni-directional radiation patterns and a realized gain of over 6 dB within the frequency band from 2.3 to 6.0 GHz, which could be a decent alternative to the EBG antennas due to significant improvements on pattern and gain bandwidth. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.",

The relative molecular mass of the isolated proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The hBD-1 gene mRNA expression in the SPC-A-1 cells was identified by Northern blot and RT-PCR. The cell wall component was injected intraperitoneally to the rats. Forty eight hours later, 5 \u00d7 106 CFU of P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 or Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 were inoculated via trachea. The bacteria colony in the supernatant of the homogenated lungs of the rats was counted 24 hours after the inoculation. Results Two protein components of BCG cell wall were fractionated. The relative molecular mass of component 2 was in the range of 18\u00d710 3-30\u00d7103. The hBD-1 mRNA expression detected by Northern blot was markedly enhanced by the stimulation of heat-inactivated BCG whole cells. The BCG-induced hBD-1 mRNA expression in the SPC-A-1 cells detected by RT-PCR was mainly contributed by fraction 2 of the BCG cell wall proteins. The bacteria decreased significantly in the lungs of the rats with the injection of BCG component 2 (n = 8, P<0.01). Conclusion The fraction (relative molecular mass is 18 \u00d7 103-30\u00d7103) of BCG cell wall proteins improve the defense of rat lungs against P. aeruginosa infection.",

The antimicrobial polypeptides were purified by the Reverse Phase HPLC and identified by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The antimicrobial activity was detected by agar diffusion test. Mass spectrum and Western-blot analysis indicated the individual character of protein. HMGN2 was isolated and purified from human lymph node, and it showed antimicrobial potency against the pathogenic strain E. coli 54,080. The immunocytochemistry staining indicated that HMGN2 was present both in human lymph node cells' nucleus and cytoplasm. In conclusion, HMGN2 protein is of antimicrobial activity and it is probably involved in the defence of innate immunity in vivo.",

After gestation of 3 - 4 weeks, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of HBD-2 peptide in different tissues of the transgenic young mice. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured and injected intraperitoneally to wild type mice and transgenic mice to observe their surviving status.PCR showed that the HBD-2 fragment had been successfully integrated into the chromosome of the mice. A widespread expression of HBD-2 gene was found in many tissues of the transgenic mice: trachea, lung, intestine, esophagus, testis, spleen, skin, endothelium, brain, etc. Four of the 7 transgenic mice survived the Staphylococcus aureus infection, and 10 wild type mice all died within 24 hours.HBD-2 may play an important role ion the host defense against Staphylococcus aureus infection.",

The antibacterial components were identified by Agar radial diffusion assay and gel overlay technique. For further purification, Preparative acid-urea gel electrophoresis and Reverse Phase HPLC were performed. The N-terminal sequencing and degenerate PCR-directered cDNA cloning were performed. The E. coli-based recombinant product was prepared and its antibacterial property was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration.A purified antibacterial polypeptide was obtained. Agar radial diffusion assay showed that the purified polypeptide had antibacterial activities against E. coli ML-35P and Pseudomanas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and its full length of cDNA were identical to High Mobility Group Chromosal protein N2 (HMGN2). The purified recombinant HMGN2 was obtained. Its MIC against E. coli ML-35p and P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 were 10.42 microg/ml +/- 3.13 microg/ml and 27.78 microg/ml +/- 8.33 microg/ml respectively, which were equal to human neutrophil defensins HNP, and the MBC were 20.83 microg/ml +/- 6.25 microg/ml and 55.56 microg/ml +/- 16.67 microg/ml respectively.HMGN2 may be another antibacterial effecter in the defense mechanisms of human cervical mucus.",

They may play an important role in mucosal innate host defense against infections. In this study, we examined their mRNAs expression in normal and pregnant women genital tract.Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed in the detection of HBD-1 and HBD-2 mRNA expression in the samples from normal and pregnant women genital tract. beta-actin was taken as positive control.RT-PCR detection revealed that HBD-1 mRNA expressed in all samples of normal women taken from vagina, cervix, endometrium, fallopian tube, and ovary, and HBD-2 mRNA widely expressed in genital tract except vagina and ovary. In pregnant women, HBD-1 mRNA widely expressed in chorion, villus, placenta, and umbilical cord, but not in amnion, and HBD-2 mRNA were detected in chorion, villus and placenta tissues.The findings of this study on the wide expression of HBD-1 and HBD-2 in both the normal and the pregnant women genital tract suggest that HBDs may play an important role in human genital tract defense mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To examine the stimulatory effect of bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) cell wall components on human \u03b2- defensin-1 (hBD-1) gene expression and analyze the response element in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. METHODS: BCG cell wall proteins were fractionated by Sephadex G-150 chromatography. Using reverse-transcription poly- merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern hybridization analysis, hBD-1 mRNA expression was detected in a human pulmonary gland epithelial cell line SPC-A-1 cells. Progressive deletions of 5'-flanking region of hBD-1 gene were produced by PCR and ligated into promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid to construct pCAT reporter plasmids. Reporter gene expression was determined by ELISA. RESULTS: There was an obvious enhancement of hBD-1 mRNA expression after stimulation with heat-inactivated BCG whole cells (50 mg/L), or the cell wall components with a molecular weight of 18-30 kDa (3 mg/L) for 8 h. The upstream sequence between -314 bp and +54 bp had the inducible activity by BCG, which contained CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-\u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CP2 cis element. CONCLUSION: BCG cell wall components (18-30 kDa) can stimulate hBD-1 mRNA expression in pulmonary gland epithelial cells. The sequence (-314 /+54) containing C/EBP\u03b2, AP-1, and CP2 binding sites in the upstream of hBD-1 is involved in this induction.",

The polyclonal antibodies were partially purified by caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The titter of specific polyclonal antibodies against HMGN2 was detected by ELISA. The immunocytochemical staining was performed to determine the distribution of HMGN2 in THP-1 cells.Gel electrophoresis of the enzyme-digested recombinant plasmid and the DNA sequencing confirmed that the recombinant prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-1lambdaT-HMGN2 was correctly constructed. After IPTG induction, the recombinant-transformed E. coli produced a bulk of GST-HMGN2 fusion protein. The polyclonal antibodies to HMGN2 was obtained from the serum of rabbit immunized with GST-HMGN2 fusion protein and its ELISA titer was 1:2000. The immunocytochemistry staining indicated that when stimulated with LPS, HMGN2 was present not only in THP-1 nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. The presence of HMGN2 was also detected in the culture supernatant.This result suggests that recombinant peptide fusion protein could be used to produce peptide antibody. HMGN2 could be present in the cytoplasm of monocytes and release to the extracellular environment when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",

Synthetic short peptides were generated for studying the relationship between function and structure. Prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed for the holo-HMGN2 and its helical domain. Their E coli-based products were also prepared for antimicrobial testing. The antimicrobial assay included minimal effective concentration, minimal inhibitory concentration, and minimal bactericidal concentration.OMIGA protein structure software analysis revealed a transmembrane alpha-helical structure (the putative antimicrobial domain) located from position 18 to 48 of the HMGN2 protein sequence. The antimicrobial assay showed that the MIC of the recombinant holo-HMGN2 against E coli ML-35p (an ampicillin-resistance strain), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were 12.5, 25, and 100 mg/L, respectively. Against the same microorganisms, the MIC of the synthetic HMGN2 alpha-helical domain were 12.5, 25, and 100 mg/L, respectively, that is, the same as with the recombinant form of HMGN2. In contrast, recombinant holo-HMGN2 was inactive against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The synthetic N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of HMGN2 had no antimicrobial activity against E coli ML-35p, P aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or C albicans ATCC 10231.HMGN2 showed potent antimicrobial activity against E coli ML-35p, P aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and, to some extent, against C albicans ATCC 10231, but was inactive against S aureus ATCC 25923 in these assay systems.

        "abstract": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an important activator and chemoattratant of neutrophils and has been implicated in airway inflammatory diseases. To explore the new gene therapeutic strategies for airway inflammation, plasmid expressing dominant negative myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88 DN) was constructed and transfected into human airway epithelial cell lines A549 and SPC-A-I. The cells were challenged with M. tuberculosis, P. aeruginosa or K. pneumoniae and the release of IL-8 was measured using ELISA. The results showed that the supernatants of M. tuberculosis and R. aeruginosa enhanced IL-8 release from the epithelial cells; and transfection of MyD88 DN diminished this effect. MyD88 DN also reduced IL-8 release from cells induced by live bacteria of P. aeruginosa or K. pneumoniae. These data suggest that MyD88 could be used as a target gene in the gene therapy of airway inflammation.",

Both molecules could effectively kill E. coli ML-35p determined by agarose radial diffusion assay. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of HCP-21 was PKRKAEGDAK and its molecular mass was 9 263.62 identified by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis. HCP-21 showed 100% identity to HMGN2 (high mobility group protein N2, HMGN2) fragment 2-11 by GenBank BLAST searching, and had the same molecular mass as HMGN2. So it was certain that HCP-21 was HMGN2. HCP-26 was SLPI (secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, SLPI) fragment by N-terminal amino acid sequencing which was SGKSFKAGVC. It was the same with SLPI fragment 26-35 by GenBank BLAST searching. Total RNA was extracted from primary culture cervical epithelial cells, and the specific primer was designed based on HMGN2 cDNA sequence. RT-PCR showed that a fragment about 270 bp was amplified, which was same to HMGN2 cDNA. It was suggested that cervical epithelial cells could express HMGN2 mRNA in physiological condition. The fusion protein GST-HMGN2 was purified by low-pressure chromatography. The antiserum of HMGN2 was prepared from the immune rabbit with the fusion protein. Cervical tissue paraffin section and cervical mucus smear were detected by immunhistochemistry. The staining results showed that HMGN2 mainly distributed in mucosa surface of cervix and existed in cervical mucus. HMGN2 constitutively expressed in cervical mucosa and mucus, so it might play an important role in innate defensive of cervical.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the molecular mechanisms of signaling transduction by which Pseudomonas pyocyanin induces IL-8 expression in human airway epithelial cells, A549 and SPC-A-1 cells were challenged with P. aeruginosa conditioned medium or pyocyanin. Chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) release from the challenged cells was measured by ELISA, and Western blot was performed to analyze the degradation of IkappaB-alpha and the phosphorylation of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) in the extracts from cells stimulated with pyocyanin. Both of P. aeruginosa conditioned medium and pyocyanin remarkably increased IL-8 expression by human airway epithelial cells. Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was found shortly after A549 cells were stimulated with pyocyanin. Western hybridization analysis also demonstrated that pyocyanin caused phosphorylation of MAPKs including ERK1/2, p38 and JNK in A549 cells. Pretreatment of A549 cells with U0126 (10 micromol/L), a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 (ERK1/2 kinase) or with SB203580 (10 micromol/L), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, diminished the pyocyanin-induced IL-8 production. These findings suggest that Pseudomonas pyocyanin can increase IL-8 expression by human airway epithelial cells through MAPKs signaling pathways and the activation of NF-kappaB is also involved in this process.",

The recombinant eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA3. 1-myc-his-HMGN2 and pEGFP-N1-HMGN2 were constructed, and then were transfected into HeLa cells. immunocytochemistry staining indicated that HMGN2 were present not only in HeLa nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. The presence of HMGN2 was also detected in the culture supernatant by ELISA with rabbit anti-serum against HMGN2 and mouse anti-His6 monoclonal antibodies. The confocal microscope observation showed the same subcellular localization as that of immunocytochemistry staining. There results suggested that HMGN2 could be present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HeLa cell as well as in the extracellular environment.",

        "abstract": "To examine the transcriptional activation of IL-8 gene induced by 4.2 dyne/cm2 shear stress in human vascular endothelial cells.The one-step RT-PCR was used for detection of IL-8 mRNAs expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after shear stress for 0.5, 1, 2 hours. To construct IL-8 green fluorescent protein reporter gene plasmid pEGFP1-IL8USCS. The endothelial cells were transfected with the pEGFP1-IL8USCS, and stimulated with 4.2 dyne/cm2 shear stress for 3 hours. The green fluorescent protein expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. NF-kappaB nuclear translocation was observed by immunocytofluorescent staining in HUVECs stimulated by shear stress for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 hours. Western blotting was used to examine kappaB phosphorylation and degradation after shear stress for 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes respectively.The results of RT-PCR showed that low laminar shear stress could induce IL-8 mRNA expression in HUVECs, its increased effect was time-dependent. Flow cytometric analysis showed that when exposed to 4.2 dyne/cm2 shear stress for 3 hours, there was a marked increase in the green fluorescent protein expression in the pEGFP1-IL8USCS-transfected cells. NF-kappaB p65 immunocytofluorescent staining of HUVECs showed that flow shear stress could induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Flow shear stress could induce IkappaB phosphorylation and degradation in HUVECs detected by Western blotting.These experiments suggested that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway would probably be involved in flow shear stress-induced IL-8 gene transcriptional activation, It may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis.",

After caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation, high titer of specific polyclonal antibody against HBD-2, which was detected by ELISA and Western blot, was obtained. This result suggests that recombinant peptide fusion protein could be used instead of the conjugate of peptide-albumin or peptide-thyroid globulin to produce antibody.

Methods: Bifidobacterium was cultured in MRS medium in anaerobic incubator and its cell wall was isolated by sonication and centrifugation. The cell wall proteins of Bifidobacteria were extracted with 2% SDS. The level of hBD-2 mRNA in HT-29 cells was detected by reverse-transcription PCR and Northern blot analysis. Results: There was no detectable signal of hBD-2 mRNA in the unstimulated HT-29 cells. However, the heat-killed Bifidobacteria, cell wall of Bifidobacteria, and cell wall proteins remarkably induced hBD-Z mRNA expression in HT-29. Conclusion: Bifidobacterium or its cell wall proteins can induce hBD-2 gene expression in human intestinal epithelial cells, which may play a role in the mechanisms of innate defense against pathogens in the intestine.",

        "abstract": "As a promising option to address the memory wall problem, 3-D processor-DRAM integration has recently received many attentions. Since DRAM dies should be stacked between the processor die and package substrate, we have to fabricate a large number of through-DRAM through-silicon vias (TSVs) to connect the processor die and package for power and input/output (I/O) signal delivery. Although such through-DRAM TSVs will inevitably interfere with DRAM design and induce non-negligible power consumption overhead, little prior research has been done to study how to allocate these through-DRAM TSVs on the DRAM dies and analyze their impacts. To address this open issue, this paper first presents a through-DRAM TSV allocation strategy that well fits to the regular DRAM architecture. Meanwhile, due to the longer path between power/ground pads and processor die, power delivery integrity issue may become more serious in such 3-D processor-DRAM integrated systems. Decoupling capacitor insertion is the most popular method to deal with power delivery integrity issue in high-performance integrated circuits. This paper further proposes to use 3-D stacked DRAM dies to provide decoupling capacitors for the processor die. This can well leverage the superior capacitor fabrication ability of DRAM to reduce the area penalty of decoupling capacitor insertion on the processor die. For its practical implementation, a simple uniform decoupling capacitor network design strategy is presented. To demonstrate through-DRAM TSV allocation and decoupling capacitor insertion strategy and evaluate involved tradeoffs, circuit SPICE simulations and computer system simulations are carried out to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and investigate various design tradeoffs.",

The basic idea is to trade data retention time of NAND flash memory for other system performance metrics including program/erase (P/E) cycling endurance and memory programming speed, and meanwhile use explicit internal data refresh to accommodate very short data retention time (e.g., few weeks or even days). We also propose SSD scheduling schemes to minimize the impact of internal data refresh on normal I/O requests. Based upon detailed memory cell device modeling and SSD system modeling, we carried out simulations that clearly show the potential of using this simple quasi-nonvolatile SSD design strategy to improve system cycling endurance and speed performance. We also performed detailed energy consumption estimation, which shows the energy consumption overhead induced by data refresh is negligible.",

        "abstract": "This paper advocates a time-aware design methodology for using multilevel per cell (MLC) phase-change memory (PCM) in data storage systems such as solid-state disk and disk cache. It is well known that phase-change material resistance drift gradually reduces memory device noise margin and degrades the raw storage reliability. Intuitively, due to the time-dependent nature of resistance drift, if we can dynamically adjust storage system operations adaptive to the time and, hence, memory cell resistance drift, we may improve various PCM-based data storage system performance metrics. Under such an intuitive time-aware system design concept, we propose three specific design techniques, including time-aware variable-strength error correction code (ECC) decoding, time-aware partial rewrite, and time-aware read-&-refresh. Since PCM-based data storage systems have to use powerful ECC whose decoding can be energy-hungry, the first technique aims to minimize the ECC decoding energy consumption. The second technique improves the data retention limit when using partial rewrite in MLC PCM, and the third technique can further improve the efficiency of time-aware variable-strength ECC decoding. Using hypothetical 2-bit/cell PCM with device parameters from recent device research as a test vehicle, we carry out mathematical analysis and trace-based simulations, which show that these techniques can improve the data retention limit by few orders of magnitude, and enable up to 97 and 79 percent energy savings for PCM-based solid-state disk and PCM-based disk cache.",

        "abstract": "The emerging three-dimensional (3D) integration and non-volatile memory based solid-state drive (SSD), which have recently received extensive attentions from both academia and industry, are promising candidates to tackle looming memory gap and storage gap in computing systems. Many critical problems need to be solved before these emerging technologies can be practically employed in computing systems. The purpose of this thesis aims to propose simple yet effective design techniques to address some critical problems and facilitate the adoptions of these technologies in real-life computing systems. First, we proposed a 3D cached-DRAM design strategy which can reduce the 3D DRAM access time and energy consumption by up to 52.5% and 54.4% for a quad-core system, respectively. Second, we developed a through-DRAM TSV (through-silicon via) allocation strategy, which can well fit to the regular DRAM architecture, for 3D processor-DRAM integrated computing system. We also proposed a novel decoupling capacitor implementation method that can reduce the IR drop of power delivery network in 3D processor-DRAM integrated computing systems by up to 61.3%. Third, we proposed a cross-layer design strategy which can reduce the average SSD response time by 61.1%. The key is to cohesively exploit run-time data access workload variation and temporal locality at the system level and NAND flash memory write latency vs. data retention time trade-off at the device level. Fourth, we proposed a self-healing SSD design strategy that exploits heat-accelerated recovery of NAND flash memory cell wear-out to improve memory program/erase (P/E) cycling endurance and hence overall SSD lifetime. Simulation results show that SSD lifetime can be improved by over five times at reasonable performance and energy consumption overhead. Finally, we developed a time-aware design methodology to overcome the significant resistance drift of multi-level per cell (MLC) phase-change memory (PCM) for MLC PCM based data storage systems. Simulation results show that our proposed time-aware design techniques can improve the data retention limit by few orders of magnitude, and enable up to 97% and 79% energy savings for PCM-based solid-state disk and PCM-based disk cache.",

        "title": "Using Planar Embedded DRAM in Memory Intensive Signal Processing Circuits: Case Studies on LDPC Decoding and Motion Estimation.",
        "abstract": "This paper studies the feasibility and potential of using planar embedded DRAM (eDRAM), which is completely compatible with CMOS logic process, to improve circuit implementation efficiency of memory-hungry signal processing algorithms. In spite of its apparent cell area efficiency advantage over SRAM, planar eDRAM is not being widely used in practice, mainly due to its very short retention time (e.g., few \u03bcs and even a few hundreds ns). In this work, we contend that short retention time may not necessarily be a fundamental issue for implementing signal processing algorithms because they typically handle streaming data, which exhibits regular and predictable data access patterns, and has a large algorithm/architecture design space. This study elaborates on the rationale and application of using a planar eDRAM in memory-hungry signal processing circuit implementations, and discusses the possible algorithm and architecture design strategies to better embrace the use of planar eDRAM. For the purpose of demonstration, we use low-density parity-check (LDPC) code decoding and motion estimation in video encoding as test vehicles. Beyond a straightforward SRAM replacement, we propose an interleaved read/write page-mode DRAM operation to reduce planar eDRAM energy consumption by leveraging LDPC code decoding data access pattern, and we investigate the potential of using planar eDRAM to enable a higher degree of image data reuse in motion estimation by proposing a folded scan structure to further improve its effectiveness. We carried out detailed planar eDRAM SPICE simulations at 45 nm node to obtain its characteristics, based on which we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of using planar eDRAM in these two case studies. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.",

Electrical resistance and magnetic measurements in the temperature range from 4 to 600 K demonstrate that both superconducting transition temperature (T c) and the Neel temperature (T N) are suppressed continuously with the lattice expansion. When the Te concentration x in Rb 0.8Fe 2-ySe 2-xTe x approaches 0.4, the superconductivity is completely suppressed, and the sample behaves like a semiconductor; meanwhile, the features for antiferromagnetic transition on resistance and magnetization curves disappear. Our observation suggests that the effect of negative-pressure-induced lattice expansion can be used to tune the correlativity of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the studied system. \u00a9 2012 American Physical Society.",

However, the association of rs10911363 with SLE was not extensively studied in Chinese mainland population. A total of 488 SLE patients and 380 controls were recruited. Unlabeled probe-based high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used in genotyping. HRMA with unlabeled probe successfully distinguished all genotypes. Neither genotype nor allele frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10911363 showed statistically significant differences between SLE patients and controls. The association of SNP rs10911363 with the diagnostic criteria of SLE was also examined. Minor allele (G) of rs10911363 was found to significantly associate with the incidence of arthritis (p\u2009=\u20090.024, odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.35, and 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.04-1.75) and increased abnormalities of antinuclear antibody (p\u2009=\u20090.002, OR\u2009=\u20091.51, and 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.17-1.95) and anti-DNA (p\u2009=\u20090.013, OR\u2009=\u20091.40, and 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.07-1.82).

In this study, we examined this association in Chinese Han population by a recently developed method, unlabeled probe-based high resolution melting analysis. Methods. A total of 297 SLE patients and 351 controls were recruited. Unlabeled probe-based high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was used in genotyping. Results. Statistically significant differences were observed in both genotype and allele frequencies for rs6887695 in the SLE patients as compared with the controls. Minor allele (C) of rs6887695 (P = 0.031, OR 0.78, [95% CI 0.63-0.98]) was found to be protective against SLE. The association of SNP rs6887695 with the diagnostic criteria of SLE was also examined. Minor allele (C) exerts protective effect on the incidence of arthritis (P = 0.013, OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.47-0.92) and abnormalities of antinuclear antibody (P = 0.022, OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49-0.95). IL-12b SNPs were irrelevant to other diagnostic criteria of SLE. Summary. Polymorphisms of rs6887695 in IL-12b gene were associated with disease risk, as well as arthritis and antinuclear antibody synthesis, of systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese population.",

ADAMTS18 is a putative tumor suppressive gene related to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We used high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis to detect the methylation levels of ADAMTS18 gene in 100 gastric cancers, 100 colorectal cancers, 70 pancreatic cancers, and equal number of adjacent normal tissues. The frequency of ADAMTS18 methylation in all three types of cancers was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. Expression levels of ADAMTS18 were inversely correlated with methylation levels. No significant association was found between ADAMTS18 methylation status and TNM staging in the cancers. In summary, epigenetic regulation of ADAMTS18 was associated with carcinogenesis. The application of HRM analysis is a fast and high-throughput way to investigate the epigenetic status of ADAMTS18.",

        "abstract": "We studied high-pressure behavior of CeFeAsO1-xFx superconductors with x=0.16 and x=0.3 by in situ measurements of electrical resistance, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with diamond anvil cell (DAC). A pressure-induced quantum phase transition from the superconducting state to the non-superconducting Kondo screened phase associated with a volume collapse was discovered in the layered CeFeAsO 1-xFx compounds. The XAS data of Ce-L3 in CeFeAsO0.7F0.3 clearly show a spectral weight transfer from the main line to the satellite line after the transition, demonstrating that C\u00e9s valence changes under high pressure. Comprehensive experimental results and analysis in this paper provide some insight into the connection among superconductivity, valence change and structural phase transition, which reveals a picture of pressure-induced competition between Kondo singlet and BCS singlet in the Ce-pnictide superconductors.

A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy-number variations (CNV) of the region encompassing CHST9 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. Most of the current studies, however, focused on the genome-wide screening of CNV, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amounts of clinical samples. In our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multi-types of hematologic malignancies, as well as healthy controls, and detected the CNV of CHST9 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found significant association between the CNV of CHST9 and these hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. We also examined CHST9 mRNA expression in the samples with one or two copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage. In general, the CNV of CHST9 have been shown to associate with hematologic malignancies. The functional consequences of CNV, however, need to be investigated extensively in the future.",

        "abstract": "Background. TNF\u03b1-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) interacting with protein 1 (TNIP1) acts as a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB and plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of immune system. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed that the polymorphism of TNIP1 was associated with the disease risk of SLE in Caucasian. In this study, we investigated whether the association of TNIP1 with SLE was replicated in Chinese population. Methods. The association of TNIP1 SNP rs7708392 (G/C) was determined by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis with unlabeled probe in 285 SLE patients and 336 healthy controls. Results. A new SNP rs79937737 located on 5 bp upstream of rs7708392 was discovered during the HRM analysis. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was found. Furthermore, rs7708392 and rs79937737 were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Hypotypes analysis of the two SNPs also showed no association with SLE in Chinese population. Conclusions. High resolution melting analysis with unlabeled probes proves to be a powerful and efficient genotyping method for identifying and screening SNPs. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was observed in Chinese population.",

A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy-number variations (CNVs) of EphA3 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. CNVs are present in the general population at varying degrees, and have been found to associate with various types of diseases including hematologic malignancies. However, most of the current studies focused on the genome-wide screening of CNVs, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large number of clinical samples.In our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multiple types of hematologic malignancies as well as healthy controls. DNA copy numbers and mRNA levels of EphA3 in these samples were examined.We found significant association between the CNVs of EphA3 and these hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We also observed a positive correlation between the relative mRNA level and gene dosage of EphA3.The CNVs of EphA3 were associated with multiple types of hematologic malignancies including ALL, AML, CLL, CML, MM, and MDS.",

Transitions from metallic Fermi liquid behavior to non-Fermi liquid behavior and from antiferromagnetism to paramagnetism are found in the pressure range of 9.2-10.3 GPa, in which superconductivity tends to disappear. The change around the quantum critical point from the coexisting antiferromagnetism state and the Fermi liquid behavior to the paramagnetism state and the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the iron-selenide superconductors demonstrates a unique mechanism for their quantum critical transition.",

Obviously different from the pressure dependence of Tc in optimally\ndoped BaFe2As1.3P0.7, the experimental results demonstrated that the pressure\ndependence of Tc for the sample investigated exhibited nonmonotonic behavior,\ni.e. the Tc increased with pressure initially before reaching the maximum at ~9\nGPa, then dramatically decreased with further increasing pressure and\ndisappeared at ~21 GPa eventually. In-situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray\nabsorption measurements with diamond anvil cells revealed that the\npressure-induced valence transition of Eu ions was a favorable factor for the\nTc enhancement, while the formation of collapsed tetragonal phase was a\nnegative factor for the superconducting transition.",

GADD45G was identified as an interleukin-2-induced immediate-early gene, and methylation of GADD45G was studied in various tumor cell lines and a few primary tumor samples. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis has been used as a novel tool for analysis of promoter methylation.In our study, we used HRM analysis to detect the methylation levels of GADD45G gene in 100 gastric cancers, 100 colorectal cancers, 70 pancreatic cancers and equal number of adjacent normal tissues.The frequency of GADD45G methylation in all three types of cancers was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. Consistent with previous reports, expression levels of GADD45G were inversely correlated with methylation levels. But we did not find significant association between GADD45G methylation status and TNM staging in all three types of cancers.In summary, application of HRM analysis to large amount of clinical samples proves to be a fast and high-throughput way to investigate the epigenetic status of GADD45G. And this is the first study to evaluate the prevalence of GADD45G methylation based on large amount of tumor samples, showing that epigenetic regulation of GADD45G was associated with carcinogenesis.",

Substitution of a large cation by a smaller rare-earth ion to simulate the pressure effect has raised the superconducting transition temperature T c to a record high of 55 K in these materials. In the same way as T c exhibits a bell-shaped curve of dependence on chemical doping, pressure-tuned T c typically drops monotonically after passing the optimal pressure. Here we report that in the superconducting iron chalcogenides, a second superconducting phase suddenly re-emerges above 11.5 GPa, after the T c drops from the first maximum of 32 K at 1 GPa.

Keratinocytes are the primary cells involved in clinical lesions caused by HSV-2. In our study, we intensively examined cytokine expression in the HSV-2-infected keratinocytes. We observed upregulation of a series of cytokines including early-induced antiviral cytokines as interferons \u03b1, \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), colony stimulating factors (CSFs) as G-CSF, GM-CSF, interleukin 3 (IL-3), growth factors (EGF, KGF, and IGF-\u03b21), defensins, selectins, leukocyte function-associated antigens (LFAs,) and toll-like receptors (TLR-2, 3, 4, and 9). More importantly, we found that HSV-2-infected keratinocytes stimulated the proliferation of lymphocytes in co-cultivation system. These data suggest that keratinocytes participate in the immune response to HSV-2 infection in two ways. They secrete inflammatory cytokines to resist the HSV-2 infection directly and recruit the immune cells to eliminate the primary infection indirectly and enhance the adaptive immunity to prevent subsequent infections.",

        "title": "Superconductivity emerging from a suppressed large magnetoresistant state in tungsten ditelluride",
        "abstract": "The recent discovery of large magnetoresistance in tungsten ditelluride provides a unique playground to find new phenomena and significant perspective for potential applications. The large magnetoresistance effect originates from a perfect balance of hole and electron carriers, which is sensitive to external pressure. Here we report the suppression of the large magnetoresistance and emergence of superconductivity in pressurized tungsten ditelluride via high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction, electrical resistance, magnetoresistance and alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements. Upon increasing pressure, the positive large magnetoresistance effect is gradually suppressed and turned off at a critical pressure of 10.5\u2009GPa, where superconductivity accordingly emerges. No structural phase transition is observed under the pressure investigated. In situ high-pressure Hall coefficient measurements at low temperatures demonstrate that elevating pressure decreases the population of hole carriers but increases that of the electron ones. Significantly, at the critical pressure, a sign change of the Hall coefficient is observed. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) is a well-known non-magnetically thermoelectric semimetal1, 2, 3. Recently, its unexpected property of large magnetoresistance (LMR) has been discovered4, yielding a research hotspot in condensed matter physics and material science. The LMR effect found in WTe2 and some other nonmagnetic compounds4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is a peculiar transport property. At ambient pressure, WTe2 crystallizes in a crystal structure of distorted MoS2 (ref. 11), and the distortion is induced by the tungsten chains that are arranged along the a axis of the orthorhombic unit cell. The electrical resistance along the a axis increases markedly when magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the dichalcogenide layers (along the c axis), resulting in the LMR effect. Theoretical and experimental investigations indicate that the LMR effect is resulted from the perfect balance between electron and hole Fermi pockets along the \u0393\u2013X direction in the Brillouin zone4, 12, 13, different from that of giant and colossal magnetoresistance previously found in magnetic materials14, 15. Due to the complicated band structure with multiple Fermi pockets in WTe2, the fine details of the electronic structure play a significant role in the LMR effect. It is well known that pressure as an important control parameter can effectively tune lattice structures and the corresponding electronic states in a more systematic fashion, avoiding the complexity brought by chemical doping13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. In particular, the Fermi surface changes had been observed in pressurized NbSe2 and NbS2 (ref. 21 and ref. 22, respectively). Therefore, the high-pressure studies on WTe2 are important to explore novel phenomena and understand the physics behind. We demonstrate here that how external pressure suppresses the LMR state and induces the emergence of superconductivity in WTe2 with the experimental results from multiple in situ high-pressure measurements. We find that, upon increasing pressure, the inter-plane lattice constant c is substantially reduced without structural phase transition, while the LMR effect is gradually suppressed and turned off at a critical pressure of 10.5\u2009GPa where superconductivity accordingly emerges. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches 6.5\u2009K at ~13.0\u2009GPa and then decreases monotonically with increasing pressure down to 2.6\u2009K at ~24.0\u2009GPa. Significantly, our Hall measurements reveal a sign change in the Hall coefficient at the critical pressure, indicating a quantum phase transition of the Fermi surface reconstruction. During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware of an arXiv paper that reports the evidence of pressure-induced superconductivity in WTe2 from electrical resistance measurements without a pressure-transmitting medium23. We first characterize the structure of the WTe2 sample at ambient pressure. Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of a powdered sample that is ground from a few pieces of single crystals. As it can be seen, the Bragg peaks in the pattern can be well indexed by orthorhombic structure. To clarify whether there is a structure change in pressurized WTe2, we perform in situ high-pressure synchrotron XRD measurements. The results shown in Fig. 2a indicate no first-order structure phase transition under pressure up to 20.1\u2009GPa. Then we extract the lattice parameters as a function of pressure, shown in Fig. 2b,c. The pressure dependence of volume also displays in Fig. 2d. It is found that the lattice constants (a, b and c) as well as the volume decrease continuously upon increasing pressure. However, the reduction of c is substantial, compared with those of the in-plane parameters. The electrical resistance measurement for the single crystal is performed under quasi-hydrostatic pressure. Since WTe2 has an anisotropic electron structure, the LMR effect was discovered along the tungsten chain direction (a axis)4. To reveal the pressure effect on the LMR state, we apply the magnetic field and current in the same manner as ambient pressure. Figure 3 shows the typical temperature dependence of electrical resistance measured at zero magnetic field for pressures ranging from 0.3 to 24.0\u2009GPa. In Fig. 3a, the electrical resistance curve at 0.3\u2009GPa shares the similar behaviour to that measured at ambient pressure4, 13. Upon increasing pressure below 13.0\u2009GPa, the electrical resistance in the whole temperature range is suppressed, while it is enhanced above 13.0\u2009GPa. Intriguingly, at the pressure of 10.5\u2009GPa, the resistance drops abruptly at 2.8\u2009K. Such a drop becomes more pronounced at higher pressures, and the zero-electrical resistance is achieved between 11.0 and 24.0\u2009GPa (Fig. 3b). To confirm whether the zero-electrical resistance state is superconducting or not, we carry out in situ high-pressure alternating-current (a.c.) susceptibility measurements. The Meissner effect is observed at the selected pressures of 15.0 and 18.3\u2009GPa, respectively (Fig. 3c). The onset temperatures of the diamagnetism are consistent with that of the electrical resistance drop (Fig. 3b). Both electrical resistance and magnetic measurements coordinately confirm that pressure induces a superconducting transition in WTe2. The Tc can reach to 6.5\u2009K at ~13.0\u2009GPa and monotonically decreases down to 2.6\u2009K at ~24.0\u2009GPa. To reveal how the LMR state evolves into the superconducting state, we systematically investigate the temperature dependence of electrical resistance at fixed pressures under different magnetic fields. We find that the positive LMR effect of WTe2 is suppressed by applying pressure (Fig. 4a,b). At the pressure of 11.0\u2009GPa and above, the positive magnetoresistance effect no longer exists (Fig. 4c,d), and the superconductivity appears simultaneously. Notably, the superconductivity of the sample is fully suppressed at 13.0\u2009GPa under 3 and 7\u2009Tesla (Fig. 4d). To determine the value of upper critical magnetic field (Hc2) precisely, we perform the temperature dependence of resistance measurements under lower magnetic fields on the pressurized sample (Fig. 5a\u2013c). Using the Ginzburg\u2013Landau formula to fit the experimental data yields the values of upper critical magnetic field at zero temperature: 1.86\u2009T at 13.7\u2009GPa, 1.44\u2009T at 16.0\u2009GPa and 0.85\u2009T at 19.4\u2009GPa (Fig. 5d). A characteristic temperature (T*ZF) as the turn-on temperature of the LMR effect at zero field is defined, as indicated by the arrows in the inset of Fig. 3a. Such a definition of the T*ZF is coincident with the temperature of the linear extrapolation of turn-on LMR temperatures under different magnetic fields. Then we summarize our experimental results in the pressure\u2013temperature phase diagram (Fig. 6a). There are two distinct regions in the diagram: the LMR state and the superconducting state. It is found that the T*ZF of the LMR state decreases with increasing pressure and vanishes at the critical pressure 10.5\u2009GPa, where the superconductivity emerges at 2.8\u2009K. The value of Tc increases up to a maximum at 13.0\u2009GPa and then declines with further increasing pressure. This phase diagram clearly demonstrates how the pressure can effectively suppress the LMR state and induce superconductivity. It is known that the perfect balance between hole and electron populations accounts for the ambient-pressure LMR effect4, 12. To understand the suppression of the LMR effect under pressure, we conduct the in situ high-pressure Hall coefficient (RH) measurements at low temperature (Fig. 6b). The set-up of our high-pressure Hall measurements leads to the detected RH combining signals from the two components of parallel and perpendicular to the tungsten chains (see Methods). Thus, the obtained results involve contributions from both hole and electron carries at the Fermi surface in the Brillouin zone. Below 10.5\u2009GPa, the RH is positive and it decreases with elevating pressure. On further increasing pressure, significantly, we find that the RH suffers from a sign change from the positive to the negative at the critical pressure of 10.5\u2009GPa, where the LMR state vanishes and superconductivity emerges. The sign change in RH is an indication of a significant reconstruction of Fermi surface, in good agreement with the reported Shubnikov-de-Hass oscillation measurements13. At the critical pressure, the second derivative of the Hall coefficient with respect to pressure shows a maximum, which is expected to become divergent in the zero temperature limit. Actually, our high-pressure XRD measurements indicate that, at the critical pressure, the c axis is compressed by 6.5%, almost 10-fold of the a-axis compressibility (0.6%) and twofold of the b-axis compressibility (3.3%). These results suggest that the reconstruction of Fermi surface is associated with anisotropic reductions of the lattice. We thus propose that a quantum phase transition occurs at the critical pressure, separating the LMR state and superconducting state. Such a kind of quantum phase transition with the changes of the Fermi surface structure can be characterized by the Lifshitz phase transition24, so the emergence of superconductivity observed in the pressurized WTe2 may be connected with this transition, reminiscent of what is seen in Fe-based superconductors25. The mechanism of superconductivity in WTe2 deserves further investigations from both experimental and theoretical sides. Single crystals of WTe2 were grown by means of a solid-state reaction. Tungsten powder (99.9%) was mixed with excessive amounts of tellurium (99.999%) and placed in an alumina ampoule, then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The operation above was performed in a glove box filled with high-purity argon gas. The mixture was heated in a furnace to 1,000\u2009\u00b0C with a rate of 100\u2009\u00b0C\u2009h\u22121, followed by keeping the temperature at 1,000\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009h. After reaction, the sample was cooled down to 800\u2009\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u2009\u00b0C\u2009h\u22121, then to 700\u2009\u00b0C at a rate of 5\u2009\u00b0C\u2009h\u22121. The quartz tube was then taken out from the furnace, and put in a centrifuge to remove the Te flux. Pressure was generated by a device, the so-called diamond anvil cell that consists of two opposing anvils sitting on the supporting plates. Diamond anvils of 300-\u03bcm flats were used for this study. Nonmagnetic rhenium gaskets with a 100-\u03bcm diameter hole were used for different runs of the high-pressure studies. The four-probe method was applied in the ab plane of the single-crystal WTe2 for all high-pressure transport measurements. For the high-pressure Hall coefficient measurements, the van der Pauw method was applied in this study. A constant current goes through the squared sample diagonally, and the Hall voltage is measured from the other diagonal. To keep the sample in a quasi-hydrostatic pressure environment, NaCl powder was employed as the pressure medium. The high-pressure alternating-current susceptibilities were detected using a primary/secondary-compensated coil system surrounding the sample26. High-pressure XRD experiments were performed at beam line 15U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. A monochromatic X-ray beam with a wavelength of 0.6199\u2009\u00c5 was chosen for all XRD measurements. Diamonds with low birefringence were selected for the experiments. To maintain the sample in a hydrostatic pressure environment, silicon oil was used as a pressure medium in the high-pressure XRD measurements. Pressure was determined by the ruby fluorescence method27. How to cite this article: Kang, D. et al. Superconductivity emerging from a suppressed large magnetoresistant state in tungsten ditelluride.

Its zero-resistance superconductivity persists from ambient pressure to the pressure as high as 261.7 GPa, a record-high pressure up to which a known superconducting state can continuously survive. Remarkably, at such an ultra-high pressure, although the ambient pressure volume is shrunk by 45% without structural phase transition, the superconducting transition temperature (T ) increases to \u224819.1 K from \u22489.6 K, and the critical magnetic field (H ) at 1.8 K has been enhanced to 19 T from 15.4 T. These results set new records for both the T and the H among all the known alloy superconductors composed of only transition metal elements. The remarkable high-pressure superconducting properties observed in the niobium-titanium alloy not only expand the knowledge on this important commercial superconductor but also are helpful for a better understanding on the superconducting mechanism.",

Studying SmB 6  under pressure provides an opportunity to acquire the much-needed understanding about the effect of electron correlations on both the metallic surface state and bulk insulating state. Here we do so by studying the evolution of two transport gaps (low temperature gap  E  l  and high temperature gap  E  h ) associated with the Kondo effect by measuring the electrical resistivity under high pressure and low temperature (0.3\u202fK) conditions. We associate the gaps with the bulk Kondo hybridization, and from their evolution with pressure we demonstrate an insulator-to-metal transition at \u223c4\u202fGPa. At the transition pressure, a large change in the Hall number and a divergence tendency of the electron-electron scattering coefficient provide evidence for a destruction of the Kondo entanglement in the ground state. Our results raise the new prospect for studying topological electronic states in quantum critical materials settings.",

        "abstract": "One of the most strikingly universal features of the high-temperature superconductors is that the superconducting phase emerges in the close proximity of the antiferromagnetic phase, and the interplay between these two phases poses a long-standing challenge. It is commonly believed that, as the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed to zero, there appears a quantum critical point, around which the existence of antiferromagnetic fluctuation is responsible for the development of the superconductivity. In contrast to this scenario, we report the observation of a bi-critical point identified at 2.88\u00a0GPa and 26.02\u00a0K in the pressurized high-quality single crystal Ca 0.73 La 0.27 FeAs 2  by complementary  in-situ  high pressure measurements. At the critical pressure, we find that the antiferromagnetism suddenly disappears and superconductivity simultaneously emerges at almost the same temperature, and that the external magnetic field suppresses the superconducting transition temperature but hardly affects the antiferromagnetic transition temperature.",

Our  in-situ  high-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction and electrical resistance measurements reveal that upon increasing pressure the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase shifts to higher temperature. We find that the stability of the orthorhombic phase that hosts the non-trivial topological ground state can be pushed up to room temperature by an applied pressure of \u223c\u00a020 GPa. This is in contrast with the commonly known 3D-TIs whose ground state is usually destroyed under pressure. Our results indicate that pressure provides a possible pathway for realizing a room temperature topological insulating state in Ru 2 Sn 3 .",

        "abstract": "In layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDCs) that display both charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity, the superconducting state generally emerges directly on suppression of the CDW state. Here, however, we report a different observation for pressurized TaTe2, a non-superconducting CDW-bearing LTMDC at ambient pressure. We find that a superconducting state does not occur in TaTe2 after the full suppression of its CDW state, which we observe at about 3 GPa, but, rather, a non-superconducting semimetal state is observed. At a higher pressure, ~21 GPa, where both the semimetal state and the corresponding positive magnetoresistance effect are destroyed, superconductivity finally emerges and remains present up to ~50 GPa, the high pressure limit of our measurements. Our pressure-temperature phase diagram for TaTe2 demonstrates that the CDW and the superconducting phases in TaTe2 do not directly transform one to the other, but rather are separated by a semimetal state, - the first experimental case where the CDW and superconducting states are separated by an intermediate phase in LTMDC systems.",

The optimally doped topological insulators Bi2Te2Se and Bi2\u2212xSbxTe2S, however, allow for such characterizations to be made. Here we report an experimental comparison of the conductance for the topological surface and bulk states in Bi2Te2Se and Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S, based on temperature-dependent high-pressure measurements. We find that the surface state conductance at low temperature remains constant in the face of orders of magnitude increase in the bulk state conductance, revealing in a straightforward way that the topological surface states and bulk states are decoupled at low temperatures, consistent with theoretical models, and confirming topological insulators to be an excellent venue for studying charge transport in 2D Dirac electron systems.",

The superconducting phases emerge at structural phase transitions, the first at 8.4 GPa for BTS and 12.4 GPa for BSTS, and the second at 13.6 GPa for BTS and 20.4 GPa, for BSTS. Electronic structure calculations show that these phases do not have topological character. Comparison of our results with prior work on Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and (Bi,Sb)2(Se,Te)3 allows us to uncover a universal phase diagram for pressure-induced superconductivity in tetradymites, providing a basis for understanding the relationships between topological behavior, crystal structure, and superconductivity for these materials.",

For elements that superconduct, it is known that hole-carriers govern the superconductivity for transition and main group metals [8-10]. The role of hole-carriers in elements that are not normally conducting but can be converted to superconductors, however, remains unclear due to the lack of experimental data. Here we report the first in-situ high pressure Hall effect measurements on single crystal black phosphorus, measured up to ~ 50 GPa, and find a correlation between the Hall coefficient and the superconducting transition temperature (TC). Our results reveal that hole-carriers play a vital role in developing superconductivity and enhancing TC. Importantly, we also find a Lifshitz transition in the high-pressure cubic phase at ~17.2GPa, which uncovers the origin of a puzzling valley in the superconducting TC-pressure phase diagram. These results offer insight into the role of hole-carriers in developing superconductivity in simple semiconducting solids under pressure.",

Superconductivity appears in CeRhGe3 at a pressure of 19.6 GPa and the transition temperature Tc reaches a maximum value of 1.3 K at 21.5 GPa. This finding provides an opportunity to establish systematic correlations between superconductivity and materials properties within this family. Though ambient-pressure unit-cell volumes and critical pressures for superconductivity vary substantially across the series, all family members reach a maximum Tcmax at a common critical cell volume Vcrit, and Tcmax at Vcrit increases with increasing spin-orbit coupling strength of the d-electrons. These correlations show that substantial Kondo hybridization and spin-orbit coupling favor superconductivity in this family, the latter reflecting the role of broken centro-symmetry.",

The transition to superconductivity (TC) increases from an initial temperature of 7.7 K at ambient pressure to 10 K at ~ 60 GPa, and then slowly decreases to 9 K by 190.6 GPa, a pressure that falls within that of the outer core of the earth. We infer that the continuous existence of the zero-resistance superconductivity from one atmosphere up to such a high pressure requires a special combination of electronic and mechanical characteristics. This high entropy alloy superconductor thus may have a bright future for applications under extreme conditions, and also poses a challenge for understanding the underlying quantum physics.",

        "abstract": "Here we report the observation of pressure-induced melting of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and emergence of a new quantum state in the honeycomb-lattice halide alpha-RuCl3, a candidate compound in the proximity of quantum spin liquid state. Our high-pressure heat capacity measurements demonstrate that the AFM order smoothly melts away at a critical pressure (Pc) of 0.7 GPa. Intriguingly, the AFM transition temperature displays an increase upon applying pressure below the Pc, in stark contrast to usual phase diagrams, for example in pressurized parent compounds of unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, in the high-pressure phase an unusual steady of magnetoresistance is observed. These observations suggest that the high-pressure phase is in an exotic gapped quantum state which is robust against pressure up to ~140 GPa.",

Here, we report contrary behavior in pressurized CeRhGe3, a non-centrosymmetric heavy fermion compound. We find that its pressure-tuned antiferromagnetic transition temperature (TN) appears to avoid a continuous decrease to zero temperature by terminating abruptly above a dome of pressure-induced superconductivity. Near 21.5 GPa, evidence for TN suddenly vanishes, the electrical resistance becomes linear in temperature and the superconducting transition reaches a maximum. In light of X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, these characteristics appear to be related to a pressured-induced Ce valence instability, which reveals as a sharp increase in the rate of change of Ce valence with applied pressure.",

We find that TaIrTe4 shows superconductivity with transition temperature (TC) of 0.57 K at the pressure of ~23.8 GPa. Then, the TC value increases with pressure and reaches ~2.1 K at 65.7 GPa. In situ high-pressure Hall coefficient (RH) measurements at low temperatures demonstrate that the positive RH increases with pressure until the critical pressure of the superconducting transition is reached, but starts to decrease upon further increasing pressure. Above the critical pressure, the positive magnetoresistance effect disappears simultaneously. Our high pressure X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that, at around the critical pressure the lattice of the TaIrTe4 sample is distorted by the application of pressure and its volume is reduced by ~19.2%, the value of which is predicted to result in the change of the electronic structure significantly. We propose that the pressure-induced distortion in TaIrTe4 is responsible for the change of topology of Fermi surface and such a change favors the emergence of superconductivity. Our results clearly demonstrate the correlation among the lattice distortion, topological physics and superconductivity in the WSM.",

Many efforts have been made to understand the microphysics in SmB6, but some puzzles that have been hotly debated and argued have not been solved. In this article, based on the latest progress made in our high-pressure studies on SmB6 and the accumulating results reported by other groups, we propose a notion named the u0027accompany-type valence fluctuation stateu0027, which possibly coexists with the bulk Kondo insulating ground state of SmB6. We expect that this notion could be taken as a common starting point for understanding in a unified way most of the low-temperature phenomena observed by different experimental investigations on SmB6, thus promoting the deciphering of the puzzles. We also expect that this notion could attract rigorous theoretical interpretation and further experimental investigation, or stimulate better thinking on the physics in SmB6.",

        "abstract": "Finding the exotic phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems (SCESs) and understanding the corresponding microphysics have long been the research frontiers of condensed matter physics. The remarkable examples for the intriguing phenomena discovered in past years include unconventional superconductivity, heavy Fermion behaviors, giant magneto-resistance and so on. A fascinating type of rare earth hexaboride RB6 (R\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009Sm, Yb, Eu and Ce) belongs to a strongly correlated electron system (SCES), but shows unusual ambient-pressure and high-pressure behaviors beyond the phenomena mentioned above. Particularly, the recent discovery of the coexistence of an unusual metallic surface state and an insulating bulk state in SmB6, known to be a Kondo insulator decades ago, by theoretical calculations and many experimental measurements creates new interest for the investigation of the RB6. This significant progress encourages people to revisit the RB6 with an attempt to establish a new physics that links the SCES and the unusual metallic surface state which is a common feature of a topological insulator (TI). It is well known that pressure has the capability of tuning the electronic structure and modifying the ground state of solids, or even inducing a quantum phase transition which is one of the kernel issues in studies of SCESs. In this brief review, we will describe the progress in high pressure studies on the RB6 based on our knowledge and research interests, mainly focusing on the pressure-induced phenomena in YbB6 and SmB6, especially on the quantum phase transitions and their connections with the valence state of the rare earth ions. Moreover, some related high-pressure results obtained from CeB6 and EuB6 are also included. Finally, a summary is given in the conclusions and perspectives section.",

        "abstract": "In a quantum magnet, localized electronic spins can form unusual collective states at low temperature. While theoretical proposals for exotic states abound, many of the most intriguing scenarios of quantum phases and phase transitions beyond classical descriptions have been difficult to realize experimentally. In one class of hypothetical states, the spins entangle locally into dimer- or quadrumer-singlets, which order in patterns breaking some of the symmetries of the crystal lattice. Experimental signatures of such a state with four-spin singlets were only recently detected in an inelastic neutron scattering study of the quasi-two-dimensional quantum magnet SrCu2(BO3)2 under high pressure. The state remained incompletely characterized, however, and its existence has been questioned. Here we report heat capacity C(T) measurements along with simulations of relevant quantum spin models and map out the (P,T) phase diagram of the material. At pressures P between 1.7 and 2.4 GPa, the temperature dependence of C/T exhibits features - a hump followed by a smaller peak at lower T - characteristic of a paramagnet with strong quantum fluctuations undergoing a phase transition below T = 2 K into a plaquette-singlet state. We also observe a different transition at T ~ 2 - 3.5 K into what appears to be a previously missed antiferromagnetic state at P ~ 3 - 4 GPa. The possibility to tune SrCu2(BO3)2 between the plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic states at moderately high pressures opens opportunities for experimental tests of quantum field theories and lattice models involving fractionalized excitations, emergent symmetries, and gauge fluctuations.",

The dysfunction of neurogenesis and increased degeneration of neurons contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. We now report that miR-211-5p, a small non-coding RNA, can impair neurite differentiation by directly targeting NUAK1, decrease neuronal viability and accelerate the progression of A\u03b2-induced pathologies. In this study, we observed that during embryonic development, the expression levels of miR-211-5p were down-regulated in the normal cerebral cortexes of mice. However, in APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 double transgenic adult mice, it was up-regulated from 9 months of age compared to that of the age-matched wild type mice. Studies in primary cortical neuron cultures demonstrated that miR-211-5p can inhibit neurite growth and branching via NUAK1 repression and decrease mature neuron viability. The impairments were more obvious under the action of A\u03b2. Our data showed that miR-211-5p could inhibit cortical neuron differentiation and survival, which may contribute to the synaptic failure, neuronal loss and cognitive dysfunction in AD. ",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that repress the expression of their target proteins. The roles of microRNAs in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not clear. In this study we show that miR-200c represses the expression of PTEN protein. PTEN downregulation by miR-200c supports the survival and differentiation of cultured neurons. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease signified by beta amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide aggregation and deposition. In a mouse model of AD that is induced by  and \u0394 double transgenes, we found A\u03b2 deposition results in neuronal ER stress that induces miR200c. Pharmacological blockade of ER stress inhibited A\u03b2-induced miR-200c overexpression in AD brains. MiR-200c was detected in the serum of both AD mice and human AD patients. These findings suggest that miR-200c functions as part of the neuronal cell-intrinsic adaptive machinery, and supports neuronal survival and differentiation in response to A\u03b2 induced ER-stress by downregulating PTEN.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies employing microRNA-seq and genome-wide sequencing have identified some non-coding RNAs that are influentially involved in AD pathogenesis. Non-coding RNAs can compete with other endogenous RNAs by microRNA response elements (MREs) and manipulate biological processes, such as tumorigenesis. However, only a few non-coding RNAs have been reported in the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we constructed the first competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network leveraging whole transcriptome sequencing and a previously studied microRNA-seq of APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 transgenic mice. The underlying mechanisms for the involvement of ceRNA in AD were validated using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay, detection of transcription levels by quantitative RT-PCR and translation levels by Western blotting, and morphological examination in primary cultured neurons. In the ceRNA network, four lncRNAs (C030034L19Rik, , A830012C17Rik, and Gm15477) and five miRNAs (miR-182-5p, miR-330-5p, miR-326-3p, miR-132-3p, and miR-484) are enriched in nine pathways and an AD-related gene pool. Among them, Ribonuclease P RNA component H1 () is upregulated in the cortex of APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 mice compared to wild type controls.  binds to miR326-3p/miR-330-5p and causes the release of their downstream target , which leads to CDC42 upregulation. This effect was disrupted upon mutation of the MRE on . Moreover, overexpression of  increased dendritic spine density in primary cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whereas knocking down of  had the reverse effect. In conclusion,  modulates CDC42 expression level in a ceRNA-dependent manner, which may represent a compensatory mechanism in the early stage of the AD pathogenesis.",

A great deal of effort by doping has been made to find superconductivity in Mn-based compounds, which are thought to bridge the gap between the two families of high temperature superconductors, but the AFM order was not successfully suppressed. Here we report the first observations of the pressure-induced elimination of long-ranged AFM order at ~ 34 GPa and a crossover from an AFM insulating to an AFM metallic state at ~ 20 GPa in LaMnPO single crystals that are iso-structural to the LaFeAsO superconductor by in-situ high pressure resistance and ac susceptibility measurements. These findings are of importance to explore potential superconductivity in Mn-based compounds and to shed new light on the underlying mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.",

        "title": "Re-emerging superconductivity at 48[thinsp]kelvin in iron chalcogenides",
        "abstract": "The recent discoveries of superconductivity at 30\u201332\u2009K in a new family of iron-based chalcogenide superconductors6, 7, 8, 9 A1\u2009\u2212\u2009xFe2\u2009\u2212\u2009ySe2 (where A = K, Rb or Cs, with possible Tl substitution) bring new excitement to the field of superconductivity10. These superconductors have unusually large magnetic moments up to 3.3\u03bcB per Fe atom and a Fe-vacancy ordering in the Fe square lattice11. How superconductivity with such a high Tc can exist on such a strong magnetic background remains perplexing10. It has been established that superconductivity in strongly correlated electronic systems can be dictated by their crystallographic structure, electronic charge, and orbital and spin degrees of freedom, which can all be manipulated by controlling parameters such as pressure, magnetic field and chemical composition12, 13, 14, 15. Pressure is a \u2018clean\u2019 way to tune basic electronic and structural properties without changing the chemistry. High-pressure studies are thus very useful in elucidating mechanisms of superconductivity as well as in searching for new high-Tc superconducting materials. We studied single crystals of Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2, K0.8Fe1.7Se2 and K0.8Fe1.78Se2 grown by the Bridgman method6, 16, 17. We conducted both high-pressure resistance and susceptibility measurements to detect superconductivity in situ at high pressures and low temperatures. Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance at different pressures for Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2 single crystals. Here we define Tc as the intersection of the tangent through the inflection point of the resistive transition with a straight-line fit of the normal state just above the transition. As can be seen, Tc starts at the maximum of 33\u2009K at 1.6\u2009GPa, shifts to lower temperatures at increasing pressures, and vanishes near 9\u2009GPa in our experimental temperature range, which is 300\u20134\u2009K for our high-pressure resistance measurements (Fig. 1a). At slightly higher pressures, however, an unexpected superconducting phase re-emerges with an onset Tc as high as 48.0\u2009K at 12.4\u2009GPa (Fig. 1b). The sample is not superconducting at pressures higher than 13.2\u2009GPa. We repeated the measurements with new samples in three independent experiments, and the results were reproducible. To confirm the pressure-induced changes of superconductivity in Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2, we also performed magnetic alternating-current susceptibility measurements in situ at high pressures (Fig. 2). The value of Tc is taken to be the onset of superconductivity defined by the intersection of a line drawn through the steep slope of the curve and the region of zero slope above the transition. The magnetic study showed that Tc decreased with increasing pressure and vanished at 9.8\u2009GPa in the first superconducting phase SC-I (Fig. 2a). With further increasing pressure, the material enters a new superconducting phase SC-II and its transition temperature reaches 40.2\u2009K at 12.2\u2009GPa (Fig. 2b). The magnetic measurements yield Tc values consistent with the resistivity data within the experimental uncertainties. These results provide convincing evidence for the existence of two distinct superconducting phases in Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2. To investigate whether the pressure-induced re-emergence of superconductivity was unique to Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2 or more general among iron chalcogenides, we conducted parallel electrical resistance measurements on K0.8Fe1.7Se2 single crystals, and observed nearly identical behaviour (Fig. 3). The initial Tc of 32\u2009K at 0.8\u20131.6\u2009GPa decreased monotonically with increasing pressure and became undetectable at 9.2\u2009GPa. At a slightly increased pressure, the second superconducting phase of K0.8Fe1.7Se2 re-emerged and reached the maximum Tc of 48.7\u2009K at 12.5\u2009GPa. We repeated the experiment six times using six single crystals cut from different batches, and the results were reproducible. We further repeated the measurements with a slightly different composition, K0.8Fe1.78Se2, and again, observed similar pressure-induced behaviour. We summarized the pressure dependence of Tc of Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2, K0.8Fe1.7Se2, and K0.8Fe1.78Se2 in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 1 to 4. The diagram clearly reveals two distinct superconducting regions: the initial superconducting phase SC-I and the pressure-induced superconducting phase SC-II. In the SC-I region, Tc is suppressed with applied pressure and approaches zero between 9.2 and 9.8\u2009GPa. At higher pressures, the SC-II region appears, in which the Tc is even higher than the maximum Tc of the SC-I region. The SC-II region has a maximum Tc of 48.7\u2009K for K0.8Fe1.7Se2 and 48.0\u2009K for Tl0.6Rb0.4Fe1.67Se2, higher than previously observed in chalcogenide superconductors. The SC-II region appears in a narrow pressure range. Unlike the usual parabolic pressure-tuning curve of Tc, the high Tc in SC-II appears abruptly above 9.8\u2009GPa and disappears equally abruptly above 13.2\u2009GPa. Intermediate Tc\u2009<\u200938\u2009K is not observed even with small pressure increment steps of 0.1\u2009GPa. A similar re-emergence of superconductivity has been observed in some other strongly correlated electronic systems, such as heavy-fermion12 and organic systems18. Our preliminary high-pressure polycrystalline X-ray diffraction results of the two iron chalcogenides K0.8Fe1.7Se2 and K0.8Fe1.78Se2 confirm that, to the first degree, the basic tetragonal crystal structure persists throughout the pressure range studied (Supplementary Information). Therefore, the disappearance of Tc in SC-I, the re-emergence of higher Tc in SC-II, and the final non-superconducting region reflect detailed structural variances within the basic tetragonal unit cell, which await future in-depth investigation with advanced diagnostic probes. For instance, the possible change in magnetic-ordering structures would require high-pressure neutron diffraction, and the possible superlattice and Fe vacancy ordering would require high-pressure single-crystal X-ray structural investigations. The pressure dependence of Tc in the SC-I region is expected but its mechanism is still much debated. Quantum criticalities are thought to affect superconductivity for strongly correlated electronic systems19. A characteristic feature of the new iron chalcogenide superconductors is the existence of Fe-vacancies in the Fe-square lattice, ordered by a \u221a5\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u221a5 superstructure11. It remains unclear whether pressure could destroy the vacancy ordering at a critical value and drive the materials into a disordered lattice. Detailed structural studies of these superconducting behaviours in the iron chalcogenide superconductors are currently being conducted. Their magnetic properties at high pressures should help us to understand the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in these iron chalcogenides. This observation of the SC-II region with the re-emerging higher Tc is unexpected. It will certainly stimulate a great deal of future experimental and theoretical studies to clarify whether the observed re-emergence of superconductivity in iron chalcogenides is associated with the quantum critical transition, magnetism, superstructure, vacancy ordering or spin fluctuation.

        "abstract": "We report comprehensive high-pressure studies on the correlation between intercalated magnetic layers and superconductivity in a EuFe2(As0.81P0.19)(2) single crystal through in situ high-pressure resistance, specific-heat, X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption measurements. We find that an unconfirmed magnetic order of the intercalated layers coexists with superconductivity in a narrow pressure range 0-0.5GPa, and then it converts to a ferromagnetic (FM) order at pressure above 0.5GPa, where its superconductivity is absent. The obtained temperature-pressure phase diagram clearly demonstrates that the unconfirmed magnetic order can emerge from the superconducting state. In stark contrast, the superconductivity cannot develop from the FM state that is evolved from the unconfirmed magnetic state. High-pressure X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements reveal that the pressure-induced enhancement of Euu0027s mean valence plays an important role in suppressing the superconductivity and tuning the transition from the unconfirmed magnetic state to a FM state. The unusual interplay among valence state of Eu ions, magnetism and superconductivity under pressure may shed new light on understanding the role of the intercalated magnetic layers in Fe-based superconductors.

        "abstract": "Non-centrosymmetric superconductors, whose crystal structure is absent of inversion symmetry, have recently received special research attentions due to the expectation of unconventional pairings and exotic physics associated with such pairings. However, it is largely unknown whether the absence of the inversion symmetry plays a role in their pairing mechanisms. In this study, we are the first to report the finding through high pressure studies that the superconductivity has a strong positive correlation with the degree of non-centrosymmetry in the newly discovered superconductors A2Cr3As3 (A=K, Rb), featured by the quasi-one dimensional non-centrosymmetric structure with conducting CrAs chains. Our data from in-situ high pressure ac susceptibility and synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that the two lattice parameters, i.e. the difference of the two distinct As-Cr-As bond angles in the CrAs chains and the distance between the chains, determine the superconductivity cooperatively. Our results suggest that the non-centrosymmetry is essential in developing superconductivity in these Q1D superconductors. The achieved data not only shed a new light on the underlying mechanism of the superconductivity in these Q1D superconductors but also provide new perspective to understand the physics in the other non-centrosymmetric superconductors.",

We report the observation of two pressure-induced quantum phase transitions in a YbB6 single crystal, i.e., from a topologically trivial semiconductor to an intermediate semimetal and then from the semimetal to a possible topologically nontrivial high-pressure gapped phase through in situ high-pressure transport and synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements. Our high-pressure absorption results reveal that the mixed-valence state in pressurized YbB6 above 15 GPa plays an important role in the formation of the high-pressure state with a reopened gap. These high-pressure results may be helpful for shedding light on the intriguing relation between the topology and the 4f electrons in the rare-earth hexaborides.",

        "abstract": "ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) is a family of proteins characterized by the presence of a metalloproteinase domain linked to a variety of specialized ancillary domains. The ADAMTS9 gene (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 9); has been characterized as a novel tumor suppressor gene in and epigenetically silenced in association with lymph node metastases in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis has been used as a tool for analysis of promoter methylation. Here, we report HRM analysis used to detect the methylation levels of ADAMTS9 gene in 100 gastric cancers, 100 colorectal cancers, 70 pancreatic cancers, and an equal number of adjacent normal tissues. The frequency of ADAMTS9 methylation in all three types of cancers was significantly higher than in normal tissues. Consistent with previous reports, expression levels of ADAMTS9 were inversely correlated with methylation levels. There was no significant association between ADAMTS9 methylation status and tumor-node-metastasis staging in all three types of cancers. In summary, application of HRM analysis to large numbers of clinical samples is a rapid and high-throughput way to investigate the epigenetic status of ADAMTS9. The present study is novel in evaluating the prevalence of ADAMTS9 methylation based on a large number of tumor samples and showing that epigenetic regulation of ADAMTS9 was associated with carcinogenesis.",

A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) of BS69 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. CNVs are present in the general population at varying degrees and have been found to associate with various types of diseases including hematological malignancies. However, most of the current studies focused on the genome-wide screening of CNVs, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amount of clinical samples. Thus, in our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multi-types of hematological malignancies as well as healthy controls. We found significant association between the CNVs of BS69 and these hematological malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We also examined the expression of BS69 mRNA in the samples with one or two copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage. In general, the CNVs of BS69 have the potential to serve as a diagnostic indicator, alone or in combination with other markers, for hematological malignancies.",

Therefore, seeking reliable biomarkers and delineating the potential biological mechanism are important for optimizing treatment strategies and improving their curative effect. In this study, using a microRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based chip assay, microRNA-153-3p (miR-153-3p) was screened and selected as a potential biomarker of aGVHD. The elevated plasma miR-153-3p levels at +7 d after transplant could be used to predict the upcoming aGVHD. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for aGVHD+/aGVHD- patients receiving haploidentical transplant was 0.808 (95% confidence interval, 0.686-0.930) in a training set and 0.809 (95% confidence interval, 0.694-0.923) in a validation set. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis indicated that indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a potential target of miR-153-3p. In vitro study confirmed that IDO could be directly inhibited by miR-153-3p. In a GVHD model, recipient mice injected with a miR-153-3p antagomir exhibited higher IDO expression levels at the early stage after transplantation, as well as delayed aGVHD and longer survival, indicating that the miR-153-3p level at +7 d post-transplant is a good predictor of aGVHD. miR-153-3p participates in aGVHD development by inhibiting IDO expression and might be a novel bio-target for aGVHD intervention.",

Packet-average performance of user flow is getting more and more important for users, and especially for network service providers. But in network active measurement area, there are not empirical efforts to investigate the performance of active measurement for packet performance from user's standpoint. We quantitatively assess and compare the one-way delay statistics experienced by user flow and active probe flow based on simulation experiments, and find that: (1) Active measurement systematically underestimates statistics of packet delay experienced by user flow and the estimation error is far severe than can be ignored. (2) Increasing sampling frequency is almost helpless for the reducing of the estimation error. (3)The estimation error degrees of active measurement decrease as the increasing of the queue utilization. The above conclusions are based on active measurements using Poisson sampling and Periodic sampling. As they are mainly used sampling methods in active measurement area, so our conclusions indicate that current active method for measuring Internet packet delay suffer from system errors from user's standpoint.",

        "abstract": "Ultra wideband (UWB) network brings both chance and challenge to personal area wireless communications. Compared with other\n IEEE 802 small range wireless protocols (such as WLAN and Bluetooth), UWB has both extremely high bandwidth (up to 480 Mbps)\n and low radiation. Moreover, the structured MAC layer of UWB is the fundamental difference to WLAN. The top one is that only\n when two UWB devices belong to the same piconet can they communicate with each other directly, which means that we must jointly\n consider topology formation and routing when deploying UWB networks because the interaction between routing and topology formation\n makes separate optimization ineffective. This paper tries to optimize UWB network from a cross-layer point of view. Specifically,\n given device spatial distribution and traffic requirement, we want to form piconets and determine routing jointly, to maximize\n the overall throughput. We formulate the problem of joint optimization to mixed-integer programming and give a practical lower\n bound that is very close to the theoretical upper bound in our simulation. Furthermore, our lower bound is much better than\n an algorithm that only considers topology formation in UWB networks.",

        "abstract": "Sampling technique is elemental and important for network measurement. It is traditionally believed that Poisson sampling is unbiased, which makes it being widely used in network active measurement area. And it is well known that the unbiased estimation of Poisson sampling is true when network state is considered. As it is coming to be an important problem to measure the packet performance of user flow, there are not empirical efforts to investigate the performance of Poisson sampling on packet performance measurement from user's view. By using various actual Internet traffic datasets in simulation experiment, the difference of packet delay statistics between Poisson sampling results and user flow was systemically investigated. Poisson sampling systematically underestimates the statistics of packet delay, and the error degree decreases with the increasing of system utilization and has no relation with the frequency of Poisson sampling. Then the reason of above simulation results was analyzed.",

Its particularity lies in that: (1) resources negotiate about which process (or task) should be triggered; (2) if the resource demand of a task can't be satisfied, the task should be given up. After having studied the arbitrator-based solution, authors present a Completely Distributed Algorithm (CDA) in this paper. They also prove the aliveness and correctness of CDA, and finally analyze the message complexity, space complexity and convergence time. Compared with the arbitrator-based algorithm, CDA can be used in the system with larger scale. To validate the efficiency of CDA, authors put forward Single Wait State Algorithm (SWSA) and a simulation experiment. The experiment indicates that, in the course of a large scale of measurement, when the concurrent number of measurement tasks created randomly is small, CDA has no better efficiency than SWSA. But with the increase of concurrent number, CDA gradually has higher efficiency. It also shows that CDA has much better ability of dealing with conflict tasks than SWSA. With the portion of conflicted tasks increasing, the efficiency of CDA even slightly increases. CDA can also be utilized in many aspects, such as disaster rescue, distributed agent collaboration, object position and so on.",

Since the clocks at end systems often behave diversely, the synchronization between end hosts is what we care about all along. In this paper, we firstly propose a general model for clock skew estimation in one-way measurements, which turns the problem of clock skew estimation to the solution of n-dimension equation group, and give the equation group needed based on different presumptions. We then present Piece-wise Reliable Clock Skew Estimation Algorithm (PRCSEA), which introduces reliability test to estimation results and eliminates the extra presumptions needed by other algorithms, such as only one clock adjustment in the measurements. PRCSEA solves the skew estimation problem in a heuristic way, and it can handle many special cases affecting the estimation of clock skew, such as routing change, clock hiccup and network congestion. PRCSEA is the only algorithm that can handle clock drift to the best of our knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Accuracy is one of the primary goals of network measurement. Concurrent execution of measurement tasks usually impacts the accuracy of measurement results, while exclusive, sequential execution of measurement tasks may avoid this kind of influence. On the other hand, one-way measurement always requires collaboration of two nodes; thus the randomly initiated measurement tasks may produce conflicts and then lead to problems such as deadlock and low efficiency. We call this kind of problem the Measurement Collaboration Problem (MCP), which belongs to the general distributed collaboration problem with conflicting tasks, while earlier studies mostly focus on a conflict-free solution. The MCP solution is an algorithm for deciding which measurement tasks can be performed by negotiation among nodes. According to the number of nodes with decision-making power, the solution can be divided into arbitrator-based and completely distributed. This paper gives the arbitrator-based MCP algorithm and proves the algorithm's aliveness, correctness and optimality. The algorithm can also be utilized in many aspects, such as disaster recovery, distributed-agent collaboration, object positioning and so on.",

People have made lots of studies of it, but many conclusions only adapt to the cases of small packet loss rate. We study the RTT characteristics on nearly 40 end-to-end paths in CSTNET and CERNET in China, and draw the following conclusions: (1) the distribution characteristics of RTT and loss rate are dependable; (2) when loss rate is small, RTT distribution is usually unimodal, but with the increase of loss rate, RTT distribution is no longer unimodal and it becomes more and more decentralized; (3) with the increase of loss rate, the occurring times of inherent RTT tend to decrease.",

Then it gives an analysis of 78357 end-to-end Internet traceroute measurements conducted between 47 traceroute servers randomly chosen from the Internet. The experiment lasted for 1 month, and 2117 paths were included. It is found that: (1) there exists dominant delay (1/3 of the end-to-end delay) in most of the routes (90%) in the Internet, and the ratio of bottleneck delay to end-to-end delay in more than 80% of the paths is between 1/3 and 3/4. (2) There may be more than one delay bottleneck in a network path. 90% of the paths have a delay bottleneck whose frequency accounting for more than half of the total number of traceroutes measuring that path. The difference between bottleneck delays is small. (3) Delay bottlenecks appear in transit network more often, and occur in AS more often. (4) At present, most of the paths in the Internet are lightly loaded, and propagation delay is the major composition of bottleneck delay.",

        "abstract": "Owning to the asymmetry of Internet paths, more and more studies have turned to the measurement for one-way metrics. However, since the clocks at end systems often behave diversely, the synchronization between end hosts is what we care about all along. In this paper, we firstly propose a general model for clock skew estimation in one-way measurements, which turns the problem of clock skew estimation to the solution of n-dimension equation group, and give the equation group needed based on different presumptions. We then present Piece-wise Reliable Clock Skew Estimation Algorithm (PRCSEA), which introduces reliability test to estimation results and eliminates the extra presumptions needed by other algorithms, such as only one clock adjustment in the measurements. PRCSEA solves the skew estimation problem in a heuristic way, and it can handle many special cases affecting the estimation of clock skew, such as routing change, clock hiccup and network congestion. PRCSEA is the only algorithm that can handle non-constant clock skew to the best of our knowledge. The time complexity of PRCSEA is O(n*logn), which is the same of that of Paxson's algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Multiple injuries have been highlighted as an important clinical dimension of the injury profile following earthquakes, but studies are scarce. We investigated the pattern and combination of injuries among patients with two injuries following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. We also described the general injury profile, causes of injury and socio-demographic characteristics of the injured patients.A retrospective hospital-based analysis of 1,871 earthquake injured patients, totaling 3,177 injuries, admitted between 12 and 31 May 2008 to the People's Hospital of Deyang city (PHDC). An electronic, webserver-based database with International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-based classification of earthquake-related injury diagnoses (IDs), anatomical sites and additional background variables of the inpatients was used. We analyzed this dataset for injury profile and number of injuries per patient. We then included all patients (856) with two injuries for more in-depth analysis. Possible spatial anatomical associations were determined a priori. Cross-tabulation and more complex frequency matrices for combination analyses were used to investigate the injury profile.Out of the 1,871 injured patients, 810 (43.3%) presented with a single injury. The rest had multiple injuries; 856 (45.8%) had two, 169 (9.0%) patients had three, 32 (1.7%) presented with four injuries, while only 4 (0.2%) were diagnosed with five injuries. The injury diagnoses of patients presenting with two-injuries showed important anatomical intra-site or neighboring clustering, which explained 49.1% of the combinations. For fractures, the result was even more marked as spatial clustering explained 57.9% of the association pattern. The most frequent combination of IDs was a double-fracture, affecting 20.7% of the two-injury patients (n = 177). Another 108 patients (12.6%) presented with fractures associated with crush injury and organ-soft tissue injury. Of the 3,177 injuries, 1,476 (46.5%) were fractures. Most injuries were located in the head (22.9%) and lower extremities (30.8%).Multiple injuries are put forward as an important component of the injury profile after this earthquake. A pattern of injury combinations and spatial aggregation of injuries was also found. Clinical diagnosis and treatment should be adapted to care of these patients. More studies are needed to generalize these findings.",

Methods The analysis was based on the data provided by the Department of Orthopedics of the Hospital up until July 18,2008. The software Microsoft EXCEL was used for data input, and SPSS 13.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results Up to July 18 420 cases from the disaster area have been treated in the department of orthopedics, including 176 men (41.9%) and 244 women (58.1%), the age was from 1 to 102 years and a median age of 43 years (2 761) among the inpatients. Most patients(328 cases) were sent to the hospital within the first three days after the quake (78.1%), and the number of inpatients were 92 4-7 days after the quake. The wounded were mainly from Mianzhu, Shifang , and Guanghan. The admission fracture diagnoses were tibial fractures (18.8%), fibular fractures (16.6%), and femoral fractures (14.9%). The major treatments were splinting, plaster fixation, or traction for closed fractures (301 cases), internal fixation or external fixation for malreduction (85 cases), and debridement suture and plaster fixation for open fractures (78 cases). Conclusion It is a vital to develop an emergent plan for fracture patients after an earthquake disaster and to strengthen the reserve of medical supplies, personnel training, and individual therapy. \u00a9 2009 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.",

The sample consisted of 810 females and 386 males, with a mean age of 47.9 years (SD=10.0, range: 16-73). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, and alternative models were evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. Results indicated that a six-factor model comprised of intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal factors emerged as the best fitting model. The current findings add to limited literature on the latent structure of PTSD symptoms described in the recently released DSM-5, and carry implications for further trauma-related research and clinical practice.",

The models are important due to their flexible non-parametric modeling abilities using Mercer kernels and the Bayesian framework for probabilistic inference. In this paper, we propose a sparse GP regression (GPR) model for tourism demand forecasting in Hong Kong. The sparsification procedure of the GPR model not only decreases the computational complexity but also improves the generalization ability. We experiment the proposed model with monthly demand data that are relevant to Hong Kong's tourism industry, and compare the performance of the sparse GPR model with those of various kernel-based models to show its effectiveness. The proposed sparse GPR model shows that its forecasting capability outperforms those of the ARMA model and the two state-of-the-art SVM models.",

        "abstract": "In present competitive environment, it is necessary for companies to evaluate design time and effort at the early stage of product development. However, there is somewhat lacking in systemic analytical methods for product design time (PDT). For this end, this paper explores an intelligent method to evaluate the PDT. At the early development stage, designers are short of sufficient product information and have difficulty in determining PDT by subjective evaluation. Thus, a fuzzy measurable house of quality (FM-HOQ) model is proposed to provide measurable engineering information. Quality function deployment (QFD) is combined with a mapping pattern of ''function-principle-structure'' to extract product characteristics from customer demands. Then, a fuzzy support vector regression machine (FSVRM) model is built to fuse data and realize the estimation of PDT, which makes use of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to simplify structure. In a word, the whole estimation method consists of four steps: time factors identification, product characteristics extraction by QFD and function mapping pattern, FSVRM learning, and PDT estimation. Finally, to illustrate the procedure of the estimation method, the case of injection mold design is studied. The results of experiments show that the fuzzy method is feasible and effective.",

Since there exist some problems of finite samples and uncertain data in many forecasting problem, the input variables are described as crisp numbers by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. To represent the fuzzy degree of these input variables, the symmetric triangular fuzzy technique is adopted.

The QPSO algorithm is a new global convergent stochastic search technique, which is inspired\n by the fundamental theory of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and quantum mechanics. The corresponding weighting matrix for\n faulty situations is developed with the faults of the thruster detected, and the QPSO is used to find the solution of the\n control reallocation problem, which minimizes the control energy cost function. Comparing with the method of the weighted\n pseudo-inverse, QPSO algorithm does not need truncation or scaling to ensure the feasibility of the solution because its particles\n search the solution in the feasible space. Both the magnitude error and direction error of the obtained control input vector\n using QPSO algorithm are equal to zero. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme based on QPSO algorithm\n performs an appropriate control reconfiguration.\n ",

A mapping relationship between fuzzy numbers and crisp real numbers that allows a fuzzy sample set to be transformed into a crisp real sample set is also presented. Furthermore, the paper proposes a novel fuzzy robust wavelet support vector classifier (FRWSVC) based on a wavelet base function and develops an adaptive Gaussian particle swarm optimization (AGPSO) algorithm to seek the optimal unknown parameter of the FRWSVC. The results of experiments that apply the hybrid diagnosis model based on the FRWSVC and the AGPSO algorithm to fault diagnosis demonstrate that it is both feasible and effective.

On the basis of that, a new support vector machine called Rv-SVM (robust v  -support vector machine) that meets SRM is proposed to deal with sale series. Moreover, by modifying the standard v-SVM formulation, Rv-SVM is characterized by simpler dual optimization and fewer output parameters. With the help of the above, a sale forecasting method based on Rv-SVM and its relevant parameter-choosing algorithm are formulated and applied to car sales forecasting, the convincing results of which definitely confirm the feasibility and validity of the forecasting method.

Experimental PE rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups:normal saline (NS) group (n = 18) , LMWH group (n = 18) and UK group (n = 18), and other 18 rabbits underwent sham operations as SHAM group (n = 18). Each group was divided into 3 subgroups based on 2 days (day 2), 4 days (day 4), and 14 days (day 14) after therapies. Arterial blood gas analysis was measured. MCP-1 levels in lung tissue and blood were assayed with ELISA at various times (day 2, day 4 and day 14 ). Fixed sections were stained with trichrome for intimal hyperplasia determination.The overall rate of success for making PE rabbit models was 90% (54/60), which was not affected by treatment. Compared with NS group, P(A-a)O2 significantly decreased in UK group. Compared with NS group, MCP-1 levels in lung tissue significantly decreased in LMWH group on day 4 [(33 \u00b1 9) ng/L vs (48 \u00b1 5) ng/L, P < 0.05] and day 14 [(30 \u00b1 11) ng/L vs (41 \u00b1 4) ng/L, P < 0.05]; MCP-1 levels in serum on day 14 also significantly decreased in LMWH group [(36 \u00b1 10) ng/L vs (51 \u00b1 5) ng/L, P < 0.05]. Compared with NS group, MCP-1 levels in lung tissue significantly decreased in UK group on day 2 and 4 [Day 2: (34 \u00b1 8) ng/L vs (50 \u00b1 4) ng/L, P < 0.05; Day 4: (29 \u00b1 7) ng/L vs (48 \u00b1 5) ng/L, P < 0.05]; MCP-1 levels in serum on day 2 and day 4 also significantly decreased in UK group [Day 2: (44 \u00b1 3) ng/L vs (48 \u00b1 3) ng/L, P < 0.05; Day 4: (44 \u00b1 4) ng/L vs (53 \u00b1 1)ng/L, P < 0.05].UK treatment may rapidly improve V/Q ratio and decrease MCP-1 levels in lung tissue or serum, but it can not inhibit persistent inflammation.

Methods: Thirty healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into alcohol group (n=10), alcohol+NAC group (n=10), and control group (n=10). Ethanol liquid diet was given to rats in alcohol group and alcohol+NAC group. NAC 300 mg/(kg\u00b7d) was given to rats of alcohol+NAC group. The pathological changes of lung tissue were observed after 8-week treatment. The activity of SOD and content of MDA of lung tissue were detected. Results: there were varying degree of alveolar and alveolar septal infiltration of inflammatory cells, and more deposition of collagen fibers at intervals of alveolar in alcohol group. The similar pathological changes were found in alcohol+NAC group, but the degree was lower than that of alcohol group. The degree of alveolitis and the degree of pulmonary fibrosis were lower in alcohol+NAC group than those in alcohol group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, respectively). The SOD activity of lung tissue was higher in alcohol+NAC group than that of alcohol group. The MDA content of lung tissue was lower in alcohol+NAC group than that of alcohol group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: NAC can increase the SOD activity and decrease the content of MDA of lung tissue, and restrain the oxidative stress induced by alcohol, decrease the degree of pulmonary fibrosis induced by chronic ethanol ingestion in rats.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to develop an overlap syndrome rat model with intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure as seen in obstructive sleep apnea, on a base of preexisting emphysema caused by 16 wk of smoke exposure to determine whether IH and emphysema existing simultaneously play overlapped roles on systematic/endothelial inflammation and endothelial damage.Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups of 15 each, labeled according to exposure conditions as control, IH, emphysema, and overlap groups. In these animals, electroencephalogram monitoring and preliminary experiments to obtain arterial blood gas values were performed. Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 concentrations in the culture medium, Ras homology A mRNA expression levels of endothelial cells from right common carotid artery, and ratio of carotid intima-media thickness of whole thickness of vascular wall expressed in percent (C-IMT) (%) values were evaluated. Subsequently, circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) within rat peripheral blood and bone marrow were measured with flow cytometry.The serum and endothelial concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and the levels of endothelial Ras homology A mRNA have statistically significant results described as overlap > emphysema > IH > control. The levels of EPCs in rat peripheral blood and bone marrow have statistically significant results described as overlap > IH > emphysema > control. C-IMT (%) values from right common carotid artery are the highest in the overlap group and the lowest in the control group. There is no statistical difference when comparing the IH and the emphysema groups.Regardless of whether IH and emphysema exposure are mechanistically synergistic, this overlap elicits a more severe systematic/endothelial inflammation and endothelial damage; meanwhile, a robust mobilization of EPCs is demonstrated, which is not to mean a robust adherent and repairing capability.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of chronic alcohol ingestion on lung interstitial tissue by detecting transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA expression. Methods: Twenty male healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into non-ethanol (substitution of maltose-dextrin for EtOH) group (n=10) and ethanol (36% total calories) group (n=10). The inflammatory cells infiltration in the alveolar space were observed and graded in rats at 16 weeks after Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. The histological change of lungs was evaluated by Masson stain and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The mRNAs of TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF were detected by real time fluorescent quantization polymerase chain reaction. Results: In light microscope, the pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltrate score was significantly higher in alcohol group than that of control group (Z = 50, P < 0.05). In TEM, mitochondrial membrane fused and fuzzy structure and collagen fiber deposition were observed in cell compartments of different levels in alcohol group. The mRNA expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF (34.74.\u00b112.29, 218.08\u00b1100.37) were both significantly increased in alcohol group compared with those of control group (18.33\u00b14.27, 90.52\u00b143.38, t = 3.702, 3.487, all P < 0.01). Conclusion: The chronic alcohol intake can cause alveolitis and lung interstitium disease by increasing the mRNA expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF.",

Data was analyzed by cluster software. Based on the concept of Beijing lineage, it was determinate two sub-groups: atypical Beijing strains and W strain/typical family strains by multiplex and real-time PCR. The associations of subgroups with drug resistance and age were assessed by the chi2 test.96 M. tuberculosis strains were genotyped in which 91.7% (88/96) strains belonged to Beijing genotype (including 3 Beijing-like strains) by spoligtyping. VNTR typing could differentiate 60 genotypes among the 88 Beijing genotype strains. 93.2% of the Beijing lineage M. tuberculosis strains of this study belonged to W strain/typical Beijing family strains (82/88). No statistically significant differences were observed in the proportions of the two sub-groups in patients of different age, or drug resistance (P > 0.05).The M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype strains were dominated on tuberculosis hospital patients of Tianjin area.

Methods: Twenty clean healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group fed non-alcohol containing Lieber-DeCarli diet (n=10) and alcohol group fed alcohol containing Lieber-DeCarli diet (n=10). Rats were killed after 16 weeks to get lung tissues. Masson staining collagen deposition was observed in alveolar interval. Contents of glutathione (GSH) and hydroxyproline(HYP) were measured by colorimetric. The level of TIMP-1 in lung tissues was detected by ELISA. Results: The more deposition of collagen fibers was found in alveolar septa of alcohol group than that of control group. Compared to control group, the content of GSH in rat lung tissues reduced significantly but HYP and TIMP-1 increased significantly in alcohol group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Chronic alcohol ingestion can cause collagen deposition in alveolar interval and higher expression of TIMP-1 in lung tissues. Alcohol may be one of reasons for pulmonary fibrosis in rats.",

Progressive infiltration of lungs was evident in chest radiography, changes suggestive of interstitial pneumonia. Oxygenation was improved by mechanical ventilation and anti-shock therapy was administered. A. veronii biovar sobria was grown in three consecutive cultures of airway secretions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Mild interstitial inflammation was revealed by pathology of transbronchial lung biopsy specimens. The clinical symptoms and the chest infiltrates improved significantly after therapy with antibiotics and glucocorticoids.A. veronii biovar sobria, an intestinal bacterial pathogen, can cause severe pneumonia, which is often underestimated and inadequately understood. Appropriate antibiotics, glucocorticoids and nutritional support are effective treatments.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research was to evaluate long-term pulmonary sequelae on paired inspiration-expiration thin-section computed tomography (CT) scans 3 years after influenza A (H1N1) virus-associated pneumonia, and to analyze the affecting factors on pulmonary fibrosis.Twenty-four patients hospitalized with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia at our hospital between September 2009 and January 2010 were included. The patients underwent thin-section CT 3 years after recovery. Abnormal pulmonary lesion patterns (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, parenchymal bands, air trapping, and reticulation) and evidence of fibrosis (architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing) were evaluated on follow-up thin-section CT. Patients were assigned to Group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and Group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis). Demographics, rate of mechanical ventilation therapy, rate of intensive care unit admission, cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose, laboratory tests results (maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatine kinase [CK]), and peak radiographic opacification of 24 patients during the course of their illness in the hospital were compared between two groups.Parenchymal abnormality was present in 17 of 24 (70.8%) patients and fibrosis occurred in 10 of 24 (41.7%) patients. Patients in Group 1 (10/24; 41.7%) had a higher rate of mechanical ventilation therapy (Z = -2.340, P = 0.019), higher number of doses of cumulative prednisolone-equivalent (Z = -2.579, P = 0.010), higher maximum level of laboratory tests results (AST [Z = -2.140, P = 0.032], LDH [Z = -3.227, P = 0.001], and CK [Z = -3.345, P = 0.019]), and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs (Z = -2.743, P = 0.006) than patients in group 2 (14/24; 58.3%).H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia frequently is followed by long-term pulmonary sequelae, including fibrotic changes, in lung parenchyma. Patients who need more steroid therapy, need more mechanical ventilation therapy, had higher laboratory tests results (maximum levels of AST, LDH, and CK), and had higher peak opacification on chest radiographs during treatment are more likely to develop lung fibrosis.",

The classification and typing of the disease were based on a consensus report recently published by Chinese Journal of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases. Chi-square test was performed to analyze the differences between groups.Of the 288 cases of EBTB, 47.9% (138/288) was classified as Type I (Inflammatory infiltrative), 33.3% (96/288) as Type II (ulcerous necrotic), 5.2% (15/288) as Type III (granulomatous hyperplastic), 7.3% (21/288) as Type IV (scar stricture) and 0.4% (1/288) as Type V (Bronchomalacia), respectively. There were 17 cases (5.9%) classified as a mixed type with a combination of Type IV or Type V disease with 1 or more of the other types. 37.5% (108/288) of the patients were young females, while young and middle-aged patients with type I and type II diseases accounted for 74.7% (215/288) of the cases, much more than old aged patients (6.6%, 19/288). 97.2% (n=280) of the cases suffered from secondary pulmonary tuberculosis. In 107 cases, the disease was located in the left, 162 cases in the right, while in 109 cases the right upper lobe bronchus was involved, and right main bronchus in 36 cases, 3 cases and 58 cases in left upper lobe with and without lingular segment, 10 cases in lingular segment only. Chest CT showed that local mucosal thickening of the trachea or bronchus was evident in 40.3% (116/288); toothed or spike protuberance in 30.9% (89/288), bronchial obstruction in 11.1% (32/288), and bronchial stenosis in 87.9% (253/288). The negative rate of sputum in the first month after interventional therapy was 60.2% (56/93), significantly higher than that in non-interventional therapy group (23.1%, 18/78).The new consensus report on EBTB was clinically useful for classification and typing of the disease, and for the selection of treatment modalities.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To observe the effects of different concentrations of alcohol on expressions of transforming growth factor(TGF)-\u03b21 and basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF) in rat pulmonary,and to explore the relationship between alcohol and pulmonary fibrosis and the possible mechanisms thereof.Methods:Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group(C,n = 8),3% alcohol group(A3,n = 8),10% alcohol group(A10,n = 8) and 20% alcohol group(A20,n = 8).The levels of TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF in the rat lung tissue were measured by immunohistochemistry after 16 weeks treatment.By Masson staining,the interstitial lung collagen deposition was observed in rats of groups.Results:Immunohistochemical results showed:(1) the positive cells of TGF-\u03b21 increased in the alcohol group.There was significant difference in the level of TGF\u03b21 between control and A20 and A10 alcohol groups(P < 0.05),but no significant difference compared with that of A3 group(P > 0.05).(2)The positive cells of bFGF increased in the alcohol groups.The number of positive cells increased as the alcohol concentration increased,and there was significant difference between the different concentrations of alcohol groups(P < 0.05).Masson results showed that the deposition of collagen increased more significantly in the alveolar interval in alcohol group than that of control group,especially in A20 group.Conclusion:The study suggested that the expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF increased in the alveolar type \u2161 epithelial cells and macrophages with the increase of the concentrations of alcohol.A certain concentration of alcohol would cause lung collagen deposition.The results also suggested that alcohol may be one of the reasons for leading to pulmonary fibrosis.",

Methods Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups(n=10 in each group). All rats were exposed to cigarette smoke twice a day (30 min each time). From 29th day on,the rats in Group A (pulmonary emphysema with short SIH) were also exposed to mixed gas of 12.5% oxygen for 1.5 hours during sleeping time every day (the expose time was divided into 4 periods,22.5 min each).The rats in Group B (pulmonary emphysema with mild SIH) were also exposed to mixed gas of 15% oxygen for three hours during sleeping time every day(the expose time was divided into 4 periods,45 min each). The rats in Group C(pulmonary emphysema with standard SIH) were also exposed to mixed gas of 12.5% oxygen for three hours during sleeping time every day(the expose time was divided into 4 periods,45 min each).

Two cases were pregnant women and 3 patients suffered such concurrent disorders as dilated cardiomyopathy, multiple myeloma or atrophic gastritis. Over 3 lung fields were involved on chest imaging studies and the oxygenation index was less than 300 mm Hg at admission. The therapies of oseltamivir and methylprednisolone were administered and mechanical ventilation was initiated within 24 hours. Refractory hypoxemia and a higher level of lactate dehydrogenase were present during treatment. Pneumothorax or mediastinal emphysema occurred in 4 patients, acute renal failure in 1 and pneumopyothorax in 1. The culture of airway secretion at 3 - 7 days after mechanical ventilation showed Staphylococcus aureus in 4 patients and Aspergillus in 2. The progress of disease was so quick that the duration from onset of clinical symptoms to hospitalization was a median of 4 (3 - 6) days and the duration from onset of clinical symptoms to death a median of 12 days.The fatal cases with A H1N1 influenza in Tianjin occurred mostly in young individuals and pregnant women. This severe disease had a rapid progression. And bacterial co-infections were quite common. Refractory hypoxemia resulting in respiratory failure was the main mortality reason.",

MIC75 and MIC50 were 6 g/L. The number of drug sensitive mycobacterium tuberculosis was most in 6 g/L MIC, and decreased progressively with MIC value changed to both sides of the descending. There was not relevance between the strain number of mild drug resistance to mycobacterium tuberculosis and the MIC value. The number of ethambutal (EMB) mild resistance strain was increased progressively with MIC value changed from low to high. The number of rifampicin (RFP) mild resistance strain was decreased progressively with MIC changed from low to high.

        "abstract": "To study the therapeutic effect Bufei granule, which is a traditional Chinese drug that can enhance the immune function of the lung, on patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, and multicenter clinical study. Three medical centers in Tianjin, China, participated in the trial. A total of 140 patients with stable COPD were enrolled and randomized into two groups, with 70 patients in each. The treatment group was treated with Bufei granule, while the control group received Bufei placebo. The pharmacological treatment lasted for 12 weeks from the date of enrollment. Then, the indexes of patients were observed. Data were analyzed to study the effect of Bufei granule, with the frequency of acute exacerbation as the primary outcome. Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes, Modified British Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score, St. George's respiratory questionnaire scores, pulmonary function, and serum inflammatory marker levels [including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transformation growth factor-beta1] were the secondary outcomes.During the 12-week treatment, treatment and control groups had no adverse reactions. The analysis of the indexes obtained from all patients showed that the therapeutic effect in the treatment group was significantly better than that in the control group because most of the similar probabilities of primary and secondary outcomes were less than 0.05, except for the level of IL-6.Bufei granule can treat patients with stable COPD by lowering the frequency of acute exacerbation, improving the quality of life, and alleviating the severity of inflammation.",

Both medical management (in terms of resuscitation and bronchoscopic interventions) and surgery have severe limitations in these patients population. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) represents the first-line treatment for hemoptysis. This article discusses clinical analysis, embolization approach, outcomes and complications of BAE for the treatment of hemoptysis.A retrospective analysis of 344 cases, who underwent bronchial arteriography at Tianjin Haihe Hospital between 2006 and 2013. Several aspects of outcome were analyzed: Demographics, clinical presentation, radiographic studies, results, complications and follow-up of BAE.Three hundred and forty-four consecutive patients underwent bronchial arteriography, 336 of 344 patients (97.7%) performed BAE; there were 1530 coils for 920 arteries embolized; the main responsible sources for bleeding were right bronchial artery (29.7%), left bronchial artery (21.6%), combined right and left bronchial trunk (18.4%), right intercostal arteries (13.3%); 61 patients (17.7%) had recurrent hemoptysis within 1 month after undergoing BAE, 74 patients (21.5%) had recurrent hemoptysis over 1 month after undergoing BAE; The common complications of BAE included subintimal dissection, arterial perforation by a guide wire, fever, chest pain, dyspnea, etc. The follow-up was completed in 248 patients, 28 patients had been dead, 21 patients still bleed, 92 patients had lost to follow-up.The technique of BAE is a relatively safe and effective method for controlling hemoptysis . The complications of BAE are rare. Although the long-term outcome in some patients is not good, BAE may be the only life-saving treatment option in patients who are poor surgical candidates.",

        "abstract": "In several organ systems, the transitional zone between different types of epithelium is a hotspot for pre-neoplastic metaplasia and malignancy, but the cells of origin for these metaplastic epithelia and subsequent malignancies remain unknown. In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63KRT5KRT7) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63KRT5KRT7 basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered epithelium and Barrett's oesophagus.",

        "abstract": "Patients with respiratory overlap syndrome (OS), defined as concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, may exhibit an increased blood concentration of ingested drugs. This poor elimination of drugs is primarily attributed to downregulated gene expression of the drug\u2011metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in the liver. However, the underlying mechanisms of the decreased expression of CYPs in OS are poorly understood. In order to address this, a rat model of intermittent hypoxia with emphysema was evaluated in the present study, by analyzing liver gene expression using the reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Intermittent hypoxia and cigarette smoke exposure caused upregulation of hepatic inflammatory cytokines, while CYPs were downregulated. This downregulation of CYPs was associated with an increase in nuclear factor (NF)\u2011\u03baB expression and a decrease in the expression of nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and glucocorticoid receptor, which are the upstream regulatory molecules of CYPs. The results of the present study indicated that, during the development of OS, systematic inflammatory reactions may downregulate hepatic CYP gene expression via the NF\u2011\u03baB signaling pathway.",

However, how hepatic metabolism is altered during cigarette smoking\u2011induced inflammation remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, a rat model of smoking was established to examine the effects of cigarette smoking on inflammation, autophagy activity, and the expression of nuclear receptor and CYP in the liver. Elevated expression of interleukin\u00a01\u03b2 and activation of autophagy in the liver were observed upon smoking exposure in rats. Cigarette smoking induced a significant reduction in the mRNA expression levels of cytochromes, including cytochrome P450 (Cyp)1A2, Cyp2D4 and Cyp3A2. Accordingly, a decrease was also observed in glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a regulator of the expression of Cyp. Activation of the GR signal in human hepatic LO2 cells did not affect autophagic genes, however, it led to the upregulation of hCYP1A2, hCYP2C19 and hCYP3A4, and the downregulation of hCYP2C9. The GR antagonist, RU486, eliminated this effect, suggesting the importance of GR in liver metabolism upon cigarette smoking.",

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-like coronavirus are a potential threat to global health. However, reviews of the long-term effects of clinical treatments in SARS patients are lacking. Here a total of 25 recovered SARS patients were recruited 12 years after infection. Clinical questionnaire responses and examination findings indicated that the patients had experienced various diseases, including lung susceptibility to infections, tumors, cardiovascular disorders, and abnormal glucose metabolism. As compared to healthy controls, metabolomic analyses identified significant differences in the serum metabolomes of SARS survivors. The most significant metabolic disruptions were the comprehensive increase of phosphatidylinositol and lysophospha tidylinositol levels in recovered SARS patients, which coincided with the effect of methylprednisolone administration investigated further in the steroid treated non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia. These results suggested that high-dose pulses of methylprednisolone might cause long-term systemic damage associated with serum metabolic alterations. The present study provided information for an improved understanding of coronavirus-associated pathologies, which might permit further optimization of clinical treatments.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate regional airway obstruction with balloon catheter in stabilizing the vital signs in experimental animals suffered from acute massive pulmonary embolism. Methods: Pulmonary embolism of right lung artery by using auto-blood clots or detachable latex balloons was established in 27 healthy sheep. When the blood oxygen saturation decreased by 25% compared to that before the procedure, the placement of balloon catheter in corresponding right main bronchus was carried out in 18 sheep (study group). Five sheep were used as control group. The blood oxygen saturation in the remaining four sheep did not reach the intervention level. The pulmonary arterial pressure, the peripheral arterial pressure, the central venous pressure, the heart rate, the blood oxygen saturation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen as well as of carbon dioxide were invasively determined. Results: The experimental model of acute massive pulmonary embolism was successfully established in 23 sheep. After the establishment of pulmonary embolism, increased heart rate, tachypnea, a decrease of \u2265 25% in blood oxygen saturation within 30 minutes and a rise in pulmonary arterial pressure were detected. After the placement of balloon catheter in study group, a reduction of the pulmonary arterial pressure and an elevation of the blood oxygen saturation as well as the arterial partial pressure of oxygen rose were observed. The difference between study group and control group was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The result of this animal experiment indicates that obstruction of airway with balloon can be served as a first aid for acute massive pulmonary embolism, which can stabilizes the animal's vital signs and, therefore, can help gain precious time for the follow-up thrombolysis treatment.",

Methods: The target areas of 7 patients with severe emphysema for valvular stenting form May 2006 to Aug. 2007 were prospectively selected on the basis of CT scan. Under general anesthesia, one-way valvular stenting were carried out over a guidewire under flexible bronchoscopy and fluoroscopic control. The symptom, pulmonary function, blood gas analysis, B-ultrasonic wave, 6 minute walk distance and thoracic CT were undertaken. Results: 4-6 stents per patient took place in 136 \u00b1 72.3 min to obstruct the upper-lobe segments unilaterally but without obvious atelectasis under imaging. The patients could walk 2 hours after the operation with relief of dyspnea. No major change in radiologic findings and lung function occurred in 2 weeks, only bronchi distal to the stents gathered together. 6-min walk distance, Borg dyspnea scale fell and the pulmonary arterial pressure showed significant (P < 0.05)statistical discrepancy. No major life-threatening complications were noted in the 15-day study period and no conspicuous change in lung function, blood gas analysis and lung volume. Lower-lobe pneumonia of nontarget area developed in 1 patient and acute episode of COPD occurred in another. Conclusions: Bronchoscopic interventional lung volume reduction may improve dyspnea and quality of life, as a rather safety therapeutic measure.",

Lung functional residual capacity (FRC) was analyzed before and 8 weeks after operation. Animals were euthanized at the 8-week time point. Lungs were removed en bloc and inflated with a super syringe to look for areas of gross collapse. Samples were collected from collapsed and non-collapsed areas, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, made paraffin section and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) to observe morphologic change of bronchi.BLVR was well tolerated without complications, and it reduced lung volumes (change in residual volume 49.5%). There was no evidence of infection, abscess, or granuloma formation, or allergic reaction. Scar tissue, generated by BLVR, replaced hyperinflated lung,improved respiratory function safely and consistently.BLVR using one-way flap device is a minimally invasive procedure and the stimulus of the devices to walls of bronchi is slight, moreover, the technique may attain effectiveness of surgery. Therefore maybe it will be a perspective treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

Methods From May 2006 to March 2008,8 cases with severe emphyseme,male 7,female 1,aged 43 - 70 years,were implanted flexible stents under general anesthesia. Among them total or partial withdrawal were performed in 2 patients. Results Four to six stents per patient were implanted into the obstructed upper-lobe branchial segments unilaterally with operation time (124.00 \u00b1 63.26) min. All patients could walk in 2 hours after operation,their dyspnea relieved obviously. No major life-threatening complications were found. Lower-lobe pneumonia developed in 1 patient and 1 patient occurred acute episode of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pneumonia occurred in 2 patients during following-up 6 - 24 months. Stents withdrawal were performed in 2 patients due to the distal end pneumonia. Conclusion The technique of stents implantation and withdrawal with one-way value stent lung volume reduction under general anesthesia is convenient and comparatively safe.",

The result showed that two protein bands which were designated human cervical protein-1 (Hcp-1), human cervical protein-2(Hcp-2) were potently antibacterial against E. coli 25922 and S. aureus 25923. Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that Hcp-1, Hcp-2 actually contained three and four protein bands respectively. The molecular weights of Hcp-1 were 6.7 kd, 10 kd, 15.4 kd; these of Hcp-2 were 4.4 kd, 6.7 kd, 9 kd, 15.4 kd.

Determination of HNP1 mRNA expression in tracheal epithelial cells was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The result showed that HNP1-gene expression was detected both in human and rabbit transfected epithelial cells; while in untransfected epithelial cells, no specific signals were detected by RT-PCR. This result and the result of our previous determination by immunocytochemical staining both demonstrated that the epithelial cells could express the antibiotic peptide when transfected with its gene, suggesting that the mucosal antibiotic peptide gene transfer might develop a new antimicrobial approach to prevention and treatment of respiratory infections.",

        "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells and cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been implicated as important effectors of antiviral defense. We previously isolated a novel antibacterial polypeptide, which was identified as high mobility group nucleosomal-binding domain 2 (HMGN2), from human mononuclear leukocytes. This study examined the antiviral activity of HMGN2 against human hepatitis virus B. HMGN2 was isolated and purified from the acid soluble proteins of the human THP-1 cell line, and identified by mass spectrum, Western blot and antibacterial assay. The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-transfected HepG2.2.15 cell line was used in the in vitro assay system. In the range of 1-100 microg/ml HMGN2, no cytotoxicity for HepG2.2.15 cells was detected by MTT assay. When incubated with HMGN2 at 1-100 microg/ml for 72 or 144 h, there was a significant reduction in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression, which were detected by ELISA, and a significant reduction in HBV DNA copies, which was determined by the real time quantitative PCR, in the supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells. Northern and Southern blot analysis also showed that the levels of the HBV 3.5 kb and the 2.4/2.1 kb mRNA species and HBV replicative intermediate DNA were significantly reduced in the HMGN2-treated HepG2.2.15 cells. These results indicated that HMGN2 protein could markedly inhibit HBV protein expression and replication in vitro.",

SPC-A-1 cells were co-transfected with pCAT hBD-1 constructs and pSV-beta-Galactosidase control vector and were stimulated with effective BCG cell wall components. CAT and beta-Gal protein expressions were determined by ELISA.The promoting activity of the -69 region was lower than that of the region -575 and -314. After being stimulated with the active fraction of BCG cell wall proteins, the relative CAT expression of pCAT hBD-1/-69 still showed the increasing tendency of -2161 construct.

Based on the nucleic acid sequence analysis and the deduced amino acid sequence, the cDNA encoded peptide sequence was found to be homologous to human \u03b2-defensin hBD-2 (50% identity and 32% similarity in mature peptide), and it possessed six characteristic cysteines. Thus, we named it rat \u03b2-defensin-2 (rBD-2). This study also showed that the expression of rat \u03b2-defensin-2 mRNA markedly increased in rat skin challenged with E. coli ML-35p, a phenomenon similar to human \u03b2-defensin-2 gene expression in the skin. It is suggested that \u03b2-defensin-2 might be an important immune mediator in the skin defense, response to infections.",

In addition to the generation of toxic oxygen radicals and nitric oxide, leukocytes express and secrete a broad array of antimicrobial proteins and peptides. In the study, an antimicrobial polypeptide was isolated and purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2. Microsequencing provided that its N-terminal amino sequence was PKRKAEGDAK, which was identical to high mobility group nucleosomal-binding domain 2 (HMGN2). Mass spectrometric value and Western blot also indicated its individual character of HMGN2. The antimicrobial assays showed that the Escherichia coli-based production of HMGN2 had a potent antimicrobial activity against E. coli ML-35p, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and to some extent, against Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The HMGN2 alpha-helical domain had the same antimicrobial activity as HMGN2. The immunocytochemistry staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot revealed that HMGN2 was present in the cytoplasm of mononuclear leukocytes and released to the extracellular environment when stimulated with IL-2. These results suggest that HMGN2 would be a novel antimicrobial effector molecule of human mononuclear leukocyte.",

METHODS: A cDNA encoding mature FALL-39 was cloned from SPCA-1 cell mRNA and the prokaryotic expression vector PGEX-1\u03bbT-FALL-39 was constructed. Two kinds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the site-direction mutagenesis were used to construct FALL-39 mutant expression vector, FALL-39-Lys- 32 and FALL-39-Lys-24. Minimal effective concentration, minimal inhibitory concentration, and minimal bacteri- cidal concentration were used to assay the antibacterial activities of these peptides. Effects of different solution on the antibacterial activity of FALL-39 and FALL-39-Lys-32 were observed by CFU determination. The hemolytic effects of these peptides were also examined on human red blood cells. RESULTS: Two site-specific mutants FALL-39-Lys-32 and FALL-39-Lys24 were obtained by PCR-induced mutagenesis. In comparison with two-step PCR which required two pairs of primers, one step PCR which required one pair of primers is a simple and efficient method for the PCR based site-specific mutagenesis. Using the prokaryotic expression system, the E coli-based products of recombinant FALL39 and its mutant peptides were also obtained. The antibacterial assay showed that FALL-39-Lys-32 and FALL-39-Lys24 were more potential in the antibacterial activity against E coli ML35p and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 than that of FALL-39, and no increase in hemolysis was observed at the antibacterial concentrations. The antibacterial activity of FALL-39-Lys-32 against E coli was more potent than that of FALL-39 in NaCl-containing LB medium, while its activity was almost the same as FALL-39 in SO4 2- containing Medium E. CONCLUSION: PCR-based mutagensis is a useful model system for studying the structure and function relationship of antimicrobial peptides. Keeping \u03b1-helical conformation of FALL-39 and increasing net positive charge can increase the antibacterial activity of FALL-39 without increasing hemolysis at the antibacterial",

        "abstract": "Aim: To examine the antimicrobial spectrum and functional structure of high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 2 (HMGN2). Methods: OMIGA protein structure software was used to analyze the two-dimensional structure of HMGN2. Synthetic short peptides were generated for studying the relationship between function and structure. Prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed for the holo-HMGN2 and its helical domain. Their E coli-based products were also prepared for antimicrobial testing. The antimicrobial assay included minimal effective concentration, minimal inhibitory concentration, and minimal bactericidal concentration. Results: OMIGA protein structure software analysis revealed a transmembrane \u03b1-helical structure (the putative antimicrobial domain) located from position 18 to 48 of the HMGN2 protein sequence. The antimicrobial assay showed that the MIC of the recombinant holo-HMGN2 against E coli ML-35p (an ampicillin-resistance strain), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were 12.5, 25, and 100 mg/L, respectively. Against the same microorganisms, the MIC of the synthetic HMGN2 \u03b1-helical domain were 12.5, 25, and 100 mg/L, respectively, that is, the same as with the recombinant form of HMGN2. In contrast, recombinant holo-HMGN2 was inactive against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The synthetic N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of HMGN2 had no antimicrobial activity against E coli ML-35p, P aeruginosa ATCC 27853 or C albicans ATCC 10231. Conclusion: HMGN2 showed potent antimicrobial activity against E coli ML-35p, P aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and, to some extent, against C albicans ATCC 10231, but was inactive against 5 aureus ATCC 25923 in these assay systems.

In the present study, we investigated the possible protective effects of puerarin against A\u00df40-induced vascular damage and impairment to angiogenesis in transgenic TG (fli1:EGFP) zebrafish and human endothelial cells. A\u00df40 peptides at 5\u03bcM caused an obvious reduction of vessel branches in the subintestinal vein basket, induced NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species and impaired vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis. Pretreatment with puerarin attenuated A\u03b240-induced vessel reduction and impairment to angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, A\u00df40 decreased VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, whereas puerarin treatment attenuated these detrimental effects. Furthermore, the restoration of A\u00df40-induced-angiogenesis impairment by puerarin was abolished by either the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10\u03bcM) or eNOS inhibitor L-NAME. The present study suggests that puerarin exerts its protective action probably through reduction of NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species overproduction and activation of the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathways.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 2% of the population aged over 65 years old. Mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress actively participate in degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in PD. Paeonolum, a main component isolated from Moutan cortex, has potent antioxidant ability. Here, we have examined the effects of paeonolum against MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity in zebrafish and PC12 cells.The overall viability and neurodegeneration of DA neurons was assessed in ETvmat2:green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic zebrafish, in which most monoaminergic neurons are labeled by GFP. Damage to PC12 cells was measured using a cell viability assay and assessment of nuclear morphology. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the level of total GSH were assessed. The mitochondrial cell death pathway including mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome C release and caspase-3 activity were also examined in PC12 cells.Paeonolum protected against MPP(+)-induced DA neurodegeneration and locomotor dysfunction in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar neuroprotection was replicated in the PC12 cellular model of MPP(+) toxicity. Paeonolum attenuated MPP(+)-induced intracellular ROS accumulation and restored the level of total GSH in PC12 cells. Furthermore, paeonolum significantly inhibited the mitochondrial cell death pathway induced by MPP(+).Collectively, the present study demonstrates that paeonolum protects zebrafish and PC12 cells against MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity.",

To identify neuroactive small molecules, we first screened 36 compounds (1-36) derived from marine natural products xyloketals and marine isoprenyl phenyl ether obtained from the mangrove fungus. Compound 1 demonstrated the most potent inhibition on the locomotor activity in larval zebrafish. Compounds 37-42 were further synthesized and their potential anti-epilepsy action was then examined in a PTZ-induced epilepsy model in zebrafish. Compound 1 and compounds 39, 40 and 41 could significantly attenuate PTZ-induced locomotor hyperactivity and elevation of c-fos mRNA in larval zebrafish. Compound 40 showed the most potent inhibitory action against PTZ-induced hyperactivity. The structure-activity analysis showed that the OH group at 12-position played a critical role and the substituents at the 13-position were well tolerated in the inhibitory activity of xyloketal derivatives. Thus, these derivatives may provide some novel drug candidates for the treatment of epilepsy.",

The etiologies,clinical manifestations,imaging,diagnosis and treatment were analyzed. Results CVT was more frequent in young patients. The onset was acute and the etiologies could be found in majority of cases. Headache was the most common primary manifestation. MRI combined with MRV could demonstrate the pattern and the occlusion of the venous system clearly. DSA could clearly show the localization of the thrombosis and the arteriovenous fistula secondary to CVT. Early diagnosis and therapy by heparin were important for good prognosis. Conclusions The etiology of CVT is various and the manifestations of CVT are not typical. MRI,combined with MRV,is now very important for the diagnosis and follow-up should be carried out in CVT patients with unreasonable intracranial hypertension. Anticoagulation therapy should be used once the diagnosis is established.",

The bidirectional permeability of the eight sesquiterpenes was studied from the apical (AP) side to the basolateral (BL) side or from the BL side to the AP side. The eight compounds were assayed by HPLC. Transport parameters and apparent permeability coefficients ( P(app)) were then calculated. The bidirectional P(app) values of the eight compounds were compared with those of propranolol, a marker of high permeability and transcellular transport. The transport of the eight sesquiterpenes was concentration-dependent in the range of 10-200 microM. Lower recoveries of ICL, BSE and DML than other sesquiterpenes were found during transport. The results indicated that all the sesquiterpenes are well absorbed mainly by the passive diffusion via the transcellular pathway and metabolism may be involved during the absorption of ICL, BSE and DML.",

External perturbations such as pH and hydrogen bonding can also trigger the spin state transition of hemes through deprotonated histidine (e.g. Cytochrome c). In this work, we report the isolated 2-methylimidazole Cobalt(II) [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)] and [Co(TTP)(2-MeHIm)], and the corresponding 2-methylimidazolate derivatives where the N-H proton of axial 2-MeHIm is removed. Interestingly, various spectroscopies including EPR and XAFS determine a high-spin state (S\u2009=\u20093/2) for the imidazolate derivatives, in contrast to the low-spin state (S\u2009=\u20091/2) of all known imidazole analogs. DFT assisted stereoelectronic investigations are applied to understand the metal-ligand interactions, which suggest that the dramatically displaced metal center allowing a promotion e(d)\u2009\u2192\u2009b([Formula: see text]) is crucial for the occurrence of the spin state transition.",

Firstly, PEI lipids, with a low molecular weight PEI headgroup and hexadecyl chain tail group, were prepared through a highly efficient ring-opening reaction of glycidyl hexadecyl ether (EpoxyC16) by amine from PEI. Then, the PEI lipids were used as a component of cationic liposomes and as a surfactant for the preparation of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticle (NP) via solvent extraction/evaporation method. As potential effective gene delivery platforms, their preparation, size, size distribution, toxicities, plasmid DNA loading, in vitro transfection and intracellular trafficking were studied. Both facile platforms showed less toxicity and higher transfection efficacy when compared to high molecular weight PEI in vitro, and may have further versatile applications in the gene delivery field.",

        "abstract": "Hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) have attracted more and more attention because of their specially branched architecture and interesting properties. A series of novel poly(amine-ester)-type HBPs were synthesized through CALB-catalyzed polycondensation between triethanolamine (TEOA) and diesters after the optimization of reaction conditions. The precise structure including degree of branching, components percentage, and the controllable terminal structures at the outer surface were determined by FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 2D NMR and GPC. The interesting multifunctionality displayed by the poly(amine-ester)-type HBPs was investigated. These HBPs could be degraded efficiently under the catalysis of lipase in weak acid buffer. The amphiphilic HBPs with hydroxyl terminals were able to form multimolecular micelles with 250-400 nm diameter, and 0.042 g L-1 CMC. They were nontoxic to COS-7 cells, while they could effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells HepG2 with IC50 of 130 \u03bcg mL-1 after an anticancer drug was encapsulated within the micelles. All these results indicated the prepared poly(amine-ester)-type HBPs can serve as multifunctional biomaterials for biomedical applications.

        "abstract": "An electrochemical sensor based on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)-gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) nanocomposite was constructed for determination of dopamine (DA). MWNTs-PEI-AuNPs nanocomposite combined the advantages of PEI-well dispersed MWNTs and in situ formed AuNPs, thus endowed with high stability and some special properties to the enzyme-free sensor. The formation of the material was characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray. Electrochemical activation of the modified sensor at a positive potential remarkably enhanced the signal due to some introduced fragmentation in the side wall of MWNTs-PEI-AuNPs. Another important conclusion which was not recognized before is that CVD-CNT with open end caps of CNT also can be electrochemically activated after coating with polyelectrolytes (PEs). The prepared sensor showed good performance for the determination of DA in a linear range from 50 to 4000 nM with a limit of detection of 6.56 nM and a sensitivity of 5.2 \u03bcA \u03bcM-1. It also exhibit high stability of at least 2 months and high selectivity of DA under the interferences of glucose, ascorbic acid, etc. due to the novel sensing materials and remarkable electrochemical activation. We also demonstrated the successful application of this sensor for the determination of dopamine in serum. \u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Although CALB-catalyzed KR of \u03b1-trifluoromethylated amines with substituents of methyl (1a), isopropyl (1c), phenyl (1d) and benzyl group (1e) can provide good stereoselectivity factors E from 31 to >200 respectively, DKR and sequential process of KR/DKR/KR possess better practical application potential because of the higher conversion (62%-84%) and the similar enantiomeric excesses (90%-99%). The enantiopreference and inversion for the \u03b1-trifluoromethylated amines displayed by CALB were observed and explained by docking modes. Namely, for 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propylamine (1a), the product amide with R-configuration was obtained, and the enantiopreference was converted to S for the amines (1b-1e) with substituents larger than methyl group.

        "abstract": "Because of the potential application of prodrugs of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) catalyzed polycondensation of profen-containing diol monomers and diesters were designed to prepare a series of biodegradable polymeric prodrugs composed of NSAID branches and poly(amide-co-ester) backbone. The structure of the products was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, NMR, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The reaction conditions of polymerization, such as the enzyme source, amount of catalyst, and temperature, were optimized. The molecular weights of resultant copolymers were 2170-13,270 g/mol, with corresponding polydispersities from 1.17 to 2.4. The copolymers had relatively high drug loadings of 44.7-59.7 wt % because every repeat unit contained one drug molecule. The strategy of enzymatic polymerization appeared to be quite general and accommodated a large number of comonomer substrates with various chain lengths and substituents. The optically pure (R)-naproxen monomer was demonstratively incorporated into the corresponding copolymers with the developed synthesis strategy. The in vitro study showed that the polyester could release the drug effectively under physiological conditions with enzyme, which indicated that the obtained product could be a promising prodrug for extending pharmacological effects by delayed drug release. With GPC analysis, we confirmed that the prodrug was completely degradable in aqueous solution. The attractive features of the copolymer were its high drug loading, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. The high tolerance of the CAL-B toward drug groups, as described in this article, provides a new route for synthesizing polymeric drugs with potential biomedical applications in mild conditions and for reducing environmental impact. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Amphiphilic poly(amine-co-ester)s, which contain a single effective enantiomer of an asymmetric drug and thus can avoid potentially serious side effects, are difficult to prepare through nonselective chemical routes not only in the process of introducing chiral drugs to the polymer, but also in the synthesis of the polymer's backbone by metal catalysts. A model of racemic mexiletine, an important antiarrhythmic agent, was used to demonstrate the tandem combination of Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B)- and Pd/C-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) and subsequent CAL-B-catalyzed polycondensation, as an efficient protocol to prepare poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized poly(amine-co-ester)s containing (R)-mexiletine with 99% ee value. Chemoenzymatic DKR and enzymatic polymerization conditions were optimized, and the optical purity of incorporated (R)-mexiletine was confirmed through its hydrolysis from polyester. The copolymers can readily self-assemble into nanometer-scale-sized micelles with well-dispersed spheres, which have a size distribution that can be efficiently adjusted by changing the polymer concentration. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "In this study we fabricated and characterized novel galactose- functionalized multidrug-containing nanoparticles, and in vitro evaluated their enhanced anti-tumorous cell cytotoxicity and hepatoma-targeting ability for the controlled delivery of two synergistic anticancer drugs. A chemo-enzymatic synthesis strategy was used to prepare a galactose-functionalized amphiphilic random copolymer containing cytarabine (Ara-C) and fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR). The formed nanoparticles were characterized for their critical aggregation concentration (CAC), morphology, cellular uptake, cell cytotoxicity, hepatoma targeting ability and controlled drug release. The micellization ability of the galactose-functionalized amphiphilic random copolymer was confirmed. In vitro drug release studies showed that the two anticancer agents could be simultaneously released from the nanoparticles. Cellular uptake assay and cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that these nanoparticles could be effectively internalized by HepG2 cells and had an evident targeting function through the selective recognition of galactose pendants of the copolymer by ASGP-R of HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the enhanced anti-tumorous cell cytotoxicity indicated the combination of Ara-C, FUDR and d-galactose in one copolymer may have a better synergistic effect. This encouraging finding illustrated that the d-galactose functionalized nanoparticles could be used as a novel potential hepatoma-targeting multidrug delivery vehicle.

The experimental protocols were first optimized on flat, smooth silica substrates using UV-vis, contact angle, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The film properties of PGEDMC/PSS multilayers are modified by varying polyelectrolyte concentration, ionic strength, and counteranion types. Hollow capsules were formed after the removal of colloidal templates; transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy were used to verify the LbL process integrity. PGEDMC/PSS planar films and capsules carrying beta-galactose as recognition signals have specific recognition abilities with peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin rather than concanavalin A (Con A) lectin observed by fluorescence spectroscopy.",

Among these examples, many enzymes from different family have been verified to be able to catalyze the same type of reaction through distinct mechanism. Many complex compounds or important intermediates can be synthesized using promiscuous enzymes or through novel synthesis pathways.

        "abstract": "Acylases have shown several promiscuities towards non-natural substrates. For example, acylases have been proved to be able to catalyze Markovnikov addition of N-heterocycles to vinyl esters recently. Some interesting and unexplainable observations drew our attention, and the acylase-catalyzed Markovnikov addition was investigated further in this paper. We detected an acylation product in the reaction and found that acetaldehyde was able to improve the reaction rate. Moreover, Markovnikov adduct could be formed using isopropenyl acetate or 2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl acetate as substrates in the presence of acetaldehyde. Based on these results, it was proposed that the so-called acylase-catalyzed Markovnikov addition actually consisted of three steps identified as acylation, hemiaminal intermediate formation and transesterification. This discovery revealed that the promiscuity of acylase for Markovnikov addition was pseudo-promiscuity. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All Rights Reserved.",

        "abstract": "The formation of so-called enzyme-substrate complex is the key step for a successful enzyme-catalysis reaction. Enzymes use substrate-binding energy both to promote ground-state association and to stabilize the reaction transition state selectively. Some residues besides the catalytic triads play important roles toward the substrate binding process. In this study, we employed ONIOM methodology and docking to explore the influence of individual amino acids of Bacillus subtilis (B.sub) lipase A on the hydrolysis reaction, with the aim to guide mutagenesis experiments on the basis of computational framework. Subsequently, the B.sub lipase A is modified experimentally with different non-polar residues at the position 12, which is spatially adjacent to the active site, by using site-directed mutagenesis. We obtain a good correlation model between the computationally predicted binding energies and the experimental measured affinities, with a correlation coefficient r=0.78. It is largely unexplored that the combination of docking and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) analyses is used in conjunction with experimental procedure to investigate the enzyme catalysis process. We therefore expect that this work could provide a new pathway for exploring the molecular mechanism of enzyme- substrate recognition and interaction. \u00a9 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The morphology of the formed nanocomposite film was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the electrochemical behaviors of the immunosensor were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Under the optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor could detect CEA in two linear ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 ng mL(-1) and from 2.0 to 200.0 ng mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.04 ng mL(-1).

Thirteen mPEG-PPAE copolymers with different profens, dicarboxylates, or PEG were designed and prepared as carriers for the sustained release of the ketoprofen, naproxen and ibuprofen amides. Their structure was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR and GPC measurements. These copolymers can readily self-assemble into nanosized micelles with the well dispersed sphere in aqueous solution, which were confirmed by DLS and TEM. The size of the micelles was influenced by the copolymer concentrations, and the higher copolymer concentration lead to the smaller size. The in vitro ibuprofen amide sustained release behavior indicated that the copolymer is highly sensitive to acid environment, and the release of ibuprofen amide can be effectively controlled. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The random copolymer was easily prepared by a two-step chemoenzymatic synthetic route, and the possibility of its self-assembly was verified by ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy using pyrene as the hydrophobic probe. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicated that aggregation morphologies of these self-assemblies were thin disks with radii from 250 to 500nm. Section analysis of atomic force microscopy for a thin disk gave a thickness of approximately 16nm. The existence of hydrogen bonds among the pendants was investigated by infrared spectra and Gaussian calculation. Cellular uptake assay observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and cell cytotoxicity tests by MTT dye reduction method showed that the self-assemblies had an evident hepatoma-targeting function to hepG2 human hepatoma cells and could effectively realize cellular internalization of azacitidine.",

The influences of reaction parameters including enzyme, solvents, molar ratio of substrates, reaction time, the carbon length of acyl donor and reaction temperature were investigated in details. And then, protease-catalyzed highly regioselective acylation of d -glucose, d -mannose and d -galactose with vinyl esters of 5-FUR gave 5-FUR-saccharide derivatives successfully.

Graphical abstract Keywords Liver-targeting Nanoparticle Random copolymer 1 Introduction In recent years, design and synthesis of polymeric micelles or nanoparticles suitable for biomedical applications have been an intense field of research, among which, the most challenging issues are how to prolong the circulation of the micelles or nanoparticles in blood and enhance their targeting functionalities to the specific site of interest [1,2] . A reliable strategy for achieving the long blood circulation is to design polymeric micelles or nanoparticles containing covalently bound drug. Therefore, polymeric micelles or nanoparticles generated through the directed-assembly of drug-containing amphiphilic polymers have emerged as a promising new class of polymer therapeutics [3\u20135] . The introduction of targeting ligands such as antibodies, sugars, folic acid, or RGD on the surface of the micelles or nanoparticles can effectively realize the specific recognition of these micelles or nanoparticles to certain site of interest, and thus enhances their targeting ability [6\u201310] . Bertin et\u00a0al. prepared core\u2013shell polymeric nanoparticles, which allowed for the surface conjugation of DNA and tumor-targeting antibodies, by self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers containing small-molecule drug segments and tosylated hexaethylene glycol segments [11] . Bae et\u00a0al. designed folate-functionalized adriamycin-containing polymeric micelles self-assembled from a amphiphilic block copolymer, folate\u2013poly(ethylene glycol)\u2013poly(aspartate hydrazone adriamycin) [12] . Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of sporadic, post-transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis [13] . An estimated 170 million people worldwide are thought to be infected with hepatitis C virus and up to 80% of infected individuals turn chronic infection [14\u201316] . Chronic HCV is the single most common indication for orthotopic liver transplantation worldwide, and long term chronic HCV infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and to hepatocellular carcinoma [17\u201319] . However, treatment of HCV infection remains problematic. Currently, the recommended therapy is a combination of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) or pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and nucleotide analogue ribavirin, which has only a success rate of <60% [20\u201322] . Furthermore, this combination treatment is limited by severe side effects. The major toxicity is a dose-dependent hemolytic anemia that is caused by high ribavirin accumulation in red blood cells, which results in a ribavirin dose reduction or premature cessation of therapy [23] . Constructing liver-targeting ribavirin-conjugating polymeric micelles or nanoparticles is a strategy for improving drug efficacy and reducing systemic side effects. However, most of the previous studies about polymeric micelles or nanoparticles have been focused on amphiphilic block copolymers, whose synthesis often requires nontrivial conditions [24] . Moreover, the preparation of these block copolymers linking drug and targeting ligands always requires a somewhat complex synthetic route [12] . Therefore, it is significant to seek more facile protocol for the formation of targeting drug-conjugating polymeric micelles or nanoparticles. Herein, we wish to achieve the formation of liver-targeting ribavirin-linking nanoparticles by self-assembly of the amphiphilic random copolymer, which could be facilely prepared by a two-step chemoenzymatic synthetic route. The aggregation morphologies, size distribution, and critical aggregation concentration of the resulting nanoparticles were, respectively, characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and fluorescence probe technology. We further evaluated liver-targeting function of the nanoparticles by cell cytotoxicity tests, and investigated in vitro release behaviors of ribavirin in different incubation media by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Lipase acrylic resin from Candida antarctica (E.C. 3.1.1.3, 10,000 U/g, CAL-B) was purchased from Sigma. Alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis (E.C. 3.4.21.14, a crude preparation of the alkaline serine protease, 100 U/mg, Subtilisin) was purchased from Wuxi Enzyme Co. Ltd. (Wuxi, PR China). \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-Azobis-(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) was purchased from Fluka and purified by re-crystallization in ethanol and dried at room temperature under vacuum. Ribavirin (raw drug) was supplied by Xinxiang Tuoxin Biochemical Science & Technology Co. Ltd. (Xinxiang, PR China). 5\u2032- O -Vinyladipyl-ribavirin (VAR) was synthesized and purified as described in the paper [25] . 6- O -Vinylsebacyl-lactose (VSL) was prepared and purified according to the literature [26] . N , N -Dimethylformamide (DMF) was HPLC grade. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol, and all other chemicals were analytical grade. 2.2 Characterization methods FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrophotometer at room temperature in the range of 4000\u2013400 cm \u22121 . 1 H NMR (500 MHz) and 13 C NMR (125 MHz) spectra measurements were run on a Bruker AMX-500 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer using DMSO- d 6 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Polymer molecular weights were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The GPC columns were standardized with near-monodisperse polystyrene from Aldrich in molecular weights ranging from 7.0 \u00d7 10 5 to 1920 Da. DMF was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. 2.3 Enzymatic synthesis of vinyl ribavirin derivative and lactose derivative A general procedure : the reaction was initiated by adding CAL-B to anhydrous acetone containing ribavirin and divinyl adipate or adding Subtilisin to pyridine containing lactose and divinyl sebacate [25, 26] . The suspension was then kept at 50 \u00b0C and stirred at 250 rpm. The reaction process was monitored using TLC, and reaction was terminated by filtering the enzyme. The product was separated by silica gel chromatography. 2.4 Synthesis of poly(5\u2032- O -vinyladipyl-ribavirin- co -6- O -vinylsebacyl-lactose) Poly(5\u2032- O -vinyladipyl-ribavirin- co -6- O -vinylsebacyl-lactose) [poly(VAR- co -VSL)] was prepared by adding VAR (398 mg, 1.0 mmol) and VSL (570 mg, 1.0 mmol) into a 10-mL polymerization tube containing DMSO (1.00 mL) and AIBN (20.0 mg). The mixture was degassed by three freeze\u2013thaw cycles, and then stirred under nitrogen at 70 \u00b0C for 24 h. The resulting product was repeatedly precipitated in methanol and dried under vacuum to afford a light yellow solid poly(VAR- co -VSL) (328 mg, 34%). M n = 17,000, M w / M n = 2.65.

The sample was prepared as follows: poly(VAR- co -VSL) aqueous solution (0.50 mg/mL, 5.00 mL) was firstly added to the vial containing a known amount of pyrene, and the final concentration of pyrene was 10 \u22124 M. The resulting mixture was then heated at 50 \u00b0C for 5 h to reach the equilibrium of pyrene in the copolymer aqueous solution. Finally, the mixture was cooled overnight at room temperature. The absorption spectra were recorded ranging from 245 to 400 nm. 2.6 CAC measurement Nine samples of the copolymer aqueous solution with concentrations ranging from 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 0.5 mg/mL were prepared and then left to equilibrate with a constant pyrene concentration of 6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 M for 12 h at room temperature. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 339 nm and the emission spectra were recorded from 360 to 460 nm. Both excitation and emission bandwidths were 3 nm. In the emission spectra of pyrene/copolymer, the intensity ratio of the first band ( I 373 ) to the third band ( I 384 ) was analyzed as a function of copolymer concentration. A CAC (critical aggregation concentration) value was determined from the intersection of the tangent to the curve at the inflection with the horizontal tangent through the points at low concentration [27] . 2.7 Nanoparticle preparation The ribavirin-containing copolymer was dissolved in DMSO at an initial concentration of 0.01%. Then, a given volume of ultrapure water (15% of the solution) was added into the copolymer/DMSO solutions with stirring. The resulting solution was dialyzed using dialysis bag (MWCO = 3500) against ultrapure water for 2 days to remove DMSO from the solution. 2.8 Transmission electron microscopy measurement Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement was performed with a JEM 200CX instrument operated at 100 kV. The nanoparticle solution was dropped onto carbon-coated copper grids and dried at room temperature before measurement. 2.9 Scanning electron microscopy measurement Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement was carried out with a Sirion-100 instrument (FEI, USA) at the acceleration voltage of 25.0 kV. Sample was prepared by loading 80 \u03bcL of the aggregate solution onto a glass slide. The glass slide was then dried and a thin layer of Au was coated on the sample surface before measurement. 2.10 Dynamic light scattering measurement Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement was carried out in the nanoparticle aqueous solution using a Nanoseries (Malvern, UK) zetasizer at a scattering angle of 90\u00b0 under 25 \u00b0C. All samples were passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm pore size filter before measurement. 2.11 Cell cytotoxicity assay HepG2 liver carcinoma cell line was provided by Biochemistry Institute of Zhejiang University and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO 2 [28] . Cells were firstly seeded in serum-containing RPMI 1640 medium to 96-well plates until 70\u201380% confluent. Then, the cells were exposed to serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing various concentrations (1.5, 3.0, 7.5, 15 mg/L ribavirin equivalent concentration, respectively) of the polymers for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C. PBS (phosphate buffer solution) was chosen as the control. The cytotoxic effects of the ribavirin-containing polymers were determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide) dye reduction assay. 2.12 In vitro release experiment In vitro release behavior of ribavirin from the copolymer was studied by dialysis experiment. Firstly, the resulting lactose-functionalized ribavirin-containing copolymer poly(VAR- co -SLA) (10.0 mg) was added to 1.00 mL incubation medium (pH = 1.2, 0.2 M HCl/NaCl/glycine solution, or pH = 7.4, 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution) and subsequently placed into a dialysis bag (MWCO = 3500). The dialysis bag was then placed into a 10-mL bottle with 5.00 mL corresponding medium and stirred at 37 \u00b0C under 100 rpm. At set time intervals, the whole medium (5.00 mL) was taken and replaced with the same volume of fresh solution. Lastly, the concentration of ribavirin released from the copolymer in different media was determined by an Analytikjena SPECORD 200 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer at 207 nm. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the amphiphilic random copolymer In this study, we developed a facile and effective method for the construction of liver-targeting drug-conjugating nanoparticles via self-assembly of the lactose-functionalized amphiphilic random copolymer. The functional drug-containing amphiphilic random copolymer could be easily prepared by a two-step chemoenzymatic synthetic route in ordinary conditions. Because of high selectivity and mild reaction conditions, it is convenient to achieve the selective synthesis of polymerizable multifunctional substrate derivatives such as drug and sugar derivatives by enzymatic approaches. The radical copolymerization of the resulting polymerizable drug derivatives with properly selected comonomers could provide an enormous variability in composition and properties of the resulting drug-containing polymers. Herein, a lactose-functionalized ribavirin-containing amphiphilic random copolymer poly(VAR- co -VSL), in which ribavirin was chosen as a model drug and lactose was employed as the targeting ligand, was facilely prepared by combining enzymatic synthesis with radical polymerization ( Scheme 1 ). By enzymatic transesterification of ribavirin or lactose with divinyl dicarboxylates, controllable selective acylation at the primary hydroxyl of ribavirin or lactose could be easily achieved without protection/deprotection steps to afford polymerizable vinyl ribavirin derivatives or vinyl lactose derivatives. Based on our previous report about the effect of the linker structure on release rate and targeting ability of drug\u2013polymer conjugates [29] , we chose 5\u2032- O -vinyladipyl-ribavirin (VAR) and 6- O -vinylsebacyl-lactose (VSL) as comonomers for further synthesis of the copolymer. The lactose-functionalized ribavirin-containing amphiphilic random copolymer was then prepared by AIBN-initiated radical copolymerization of VAR with VSL and fully characterized by FTIR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and GPC. From FTIR spectrum data of the copolymer, it could be found that vinyl group absorption present in comonomers was absent in the corresponding copolymer (see Supplementary data ). 13 C NMR ( Fig.\u00a01 ) and 1 H NMR data of the copolymer revealed the disappearance of vinyl groups and the existence of ribavirin and lactose groups. From the 1 H NMR spectrum, the molar ratio of VAR to VSL comonomers in the copolymer could be approximately calculated. Thus, the loading capacity of ribavirin in the copolymer could be estimated. According to this method, the content of ribavirin in the copolymer was calculated as 30.7 wt%. Furthermore, the copolymer containing galactose and ribavirin [poly(VAR- co -VGA)], the copolymer containing glucose and ribavirin [poly(VAR- co -VGL)], and the sugar-free polymer (PVAR) were, respectively, prepared and characterized by the same methods (see Supplementary data ). 3.2 Formation and characterization of the nanoparticles The resulting lactose-functionalized ribavirin-linking random copolymer was an amphiphilic polymer, which contained hydrophobic main chains and hydrophilic pendants. Therefore, certain selective polar solvents may trigger self-assembly of the copolymer. The hydrophobic components were preferred to be tucked in the interior of an assembly, and the hydrophilic parts were exposed to the bulk solvent ( Scheme 1 ). Self-assembly of the copolymer was preliminarily proved by UV\u2013vis absorption spectra using pyrene as the guest molecule. From the UV absorption spectrum of pyrene in water, it could be found that pyrene was a strong hydrophobic compound ( Fig.\u00a02 ). If the amphiphilic random copolymer does indeed form the core\u2013shell aggregates in water, the copolymer should be able to act as nanocontainers for pyrene molecules in water. As expected, an UV absorbance of 0.24 was investigated at 341 nm when 10 \u22124 M pyrene was dispersed in the aqueous solution of the copolymer poly(VAR- co -VSL). The self-assembling ability of the amphiphilic random copolymer poly(VAR- co -VSL) in water was also confirmed by the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) measurement using pyrene as the hydrophobic fluorescent probe. In emission spectra of pyrene, the value of I 373 / I 384 emission intensity ratio was very sensitive to the\u00a0polarity of the medium surrounding pyrene molecules [30] . The larger the value was, the bigger the polarity of the medium was. From the plot of fluorescence intensity ratio ( I 373 / I 384 ) versus poly(VAR- co -VSL) concentration ( Fig.\u00a03 ), an abrupt decrease of I 373 / I 384 value could be observed at a critical concentration, indicating the formation of aggregates and the transfer of pyrene into the hydrophobic interior of aggregates [31] . The critical concentration was defined as CAC. From this figure, we could find that the CAC value of poly(VAR- co -VSL) in water was about 0.1 mg/L, which allowed their use in very dilute aqueous media such as body fluids. The CAC measurement of poly(VAR- co -VSL) further proved the formation of self-assemblies from the amphiphilic random copolymer. Aggregation morphology of the self-assemblies was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ( Fig.\u00a04 B and C). Apparently, the self-assemblies were well dispersed as individual nanoparticles with regularly spherical shape in the aqueous phase. From the TEM image, the average diameter of the nanoparticles from poly(VAR- co -VSL) was about 135 nm in the dry state. The size of the nanoparticles was also measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles was 174 \u00b1 27 nm in the aqueous solution of poly(VAR- co -VSL) ( Fig.\u00a04 A), which was in agreement with the TEM result. 3.3 Cell cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles It is well known that terminal galactose and N -acetylgalactosamine can mediate efficient liver targeting via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) of hepatocytes [32\u201335] . In order to verify whether the resulting lactose-functionalized nanoparticles had targeting function against living cells, cell cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles from poly(VAR- co -VSL) was investigated in hepG2 human hepatoma cells, which overexpressed galactose-binding asialoglycoprotein receptor. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was chosen as the control. Evidently, the lactose-functionalized nanoparticles from poly(VAR- co -VSL) showed effective growth-inhibitory activity in hepG2 cells at the ribavirin equivalent concentration of 6 \u03bcg/mL ( Fig.\u00a05 ). Similarly, cell cytotoxicity effects of the nanoparticles from sugar-free polymer PVAR, glucose-containing copolymer poly(VAR- co -VGL), and galactose-containing copolymer poly(VAR- co -VGA) on hepG2 cells were, respectively, determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) dye reduction assays. The nanoparticles from PVAR or poly(VAR- co -VGL) had no evident effect on the hepG2 cell viability. The growth of hepG2 cells was inhibited by the nanoparticles from poly(VAR- co -VGA) at the ribavirin equivalent concentration of 12 \u03bcg/mL. It was obvious that the lactose-functionalized nanoparticles self-assembled from the amphiphilic random copolymer poly(VAR- co -VSL) showed an enhanced liver-targeting function than the galactose-installing nanoparticles from poly(VAR- co -VGA). 3.4 In vitro release of ribavirin In order to investigate whether ribavirin could be slowly released from the system, in vitro release behaviors of ribavirin from poly(VAR- co -VSL) in different media were studied. Small-molecule ribavirin (raw drug) was chosen as the control. Two solutions, pH = 7.4 phosphate buffer solution (simulated extracellular fluids) and pH = 1.2 hydrochloric acid solution (simulated gastric juice), were chosen as incubation media. The release process of ribavirin in different incubation media was monitored by UV, and the curves are shown in Fig.\u00a06 . In pH = 7.4 phosphate buffer solution, ribavirin (raw drug) was quickly released and the cumulative released amount was up to 100% after 2 h. Comparatively, ribavirin was slowly released from poly(VAR- co -VSL) with pseudo zero-order kinetics in the two incubation media. The cumulative released ribavirin was 63 and 38% after 7 days in pH = 1.2 hydrochloric acid solution and pH = 7.4 phosphate buffer solution, respectively. Moreover, the liberation rate of ribavirin was relative with pH value of incubation medium. In pH = 1.2 hydrochloric acid solution, the liberation rate of ribavirin was 9.1%/day, which is faster than in pH = 7.4 phosphate buffer solution (5.4%/day) because the ester bonds binding ribavirin to macromolecular carrier could more easily undergo hydrolysis in acidic medium. 4 Conclusions In this study, a convenient and effective protocol for constructing liver-targeting drug-conjugating nanoparticles was developed by the self-assembly of facilely synthesized lactose-functionalized ribavirin-containing amphiphilic random copolymer. The resulting self-assemblies could be well dispersed as spherical nanoparticles in water, whose hydrodynamic diameter was 174 \u00b1 27 nm. The lower CAC value (0.1 mg/L) of the nanoparticles allowed their use in very dilute aqueous media such as body fluids. Moreover, the nanoparticles had effective growth-inhibitory activity in hepG2 human hepatoma cells. Ribavirin could be slowly released from the system with pseudo zero-order kinetics in different incubation media. Further studies about in vivo disposition of the lactose-functionalized nanoparticles are being conducted in our laboratory.

An effective approach to the control of the enzymatic enantioselectivity and the prediction of the increasing tendency was developed based on the T(r) influenced by reaction media. The T(r) for the resolution catalyzed by Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) was found at 29 \u00b0C in aqueous and S-ketoprofen was obtained predominantly at 40 \u00b0C. However, CRL showed R-selectivity at 40 \u00b0C in diisopropyl ether because the T(r) was changed to 56 \u00b0C. CRL, lipase from AYS Amano(\u00ae) and Mucor javanicus lipase were further applied for the investigation of the enzymatic enantioselectivity in dioxane, DIPE, isooctane and their mixed media with water. The effects of the reaction medium on T(r) could be related to the solvent hydrophobicity, the lipase conformational flexibility and the interaction between the enantiomers and the lipase.",

        "abstract": "Bienzyme electrode with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GOD) multilayers was constructed based on sugar\u2013lectin biospecific interactions for amperometric determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to monitor the uniform layer-by-layer assembly of concanavalin A (Con A) and HRP or GOD on polyelectrolyte precursor film-modified Au electrode. Substituted phenolic compounds and aromatic amines could be determined with in situ generation of H 2 O 2 by GOD-catalyzed oxidation of glucose. The parameters of the biosensor including the number of assembled HRP and GOD layer, and the concentrations of glucose were optimized. The linear range for the determination of catechol and p -phenyldiamine was 6.0\u201360.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 and 7.6\u201368.4 \u03bcmol L \u22121 with detection limit of 0.9 \u03bcmol L \u22121 and 0.4 \u03bcmol L \u22121 , respectively. The biosensor possessed high sensitivity and fast response for phenolic compounds and 95% of the maximum response could be reached in about 3 s. Glucose, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and starch exhibited no interference for the detection. The biosensor presented high stability due to the design for in situ generation of H 2 O 2 with bienzyme system. Keywords Bienzyme biosensor Layer-by-layer Biospecific affinity Phenolic compounds Aromatic amine 1 Introduction Phenolic compounds and aromatic amines were widely distributed in nature and possessed relevance in several industrial processes. Owing to the toxicity and persistency, sensitive and rapid monitoring of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines has gained significance in environmental control and human health [1\u20133] . Different from conventional analytical techniques such as chromatographic method, enzyme-based biosensors offer an attractive route because of their prominent advantages of procedural simplicity, fast response and selectivity. Though tyrosinase or laccase-based biosensors have been described, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) biosensors are more sensitive for the detection of a wide range of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines [2,4\u20137] . Based on the double displacement or \u201cping-pong\u201d mechanism [2,7] , H 2 O 2 is needed for such detection. The presence of a high concentration of H 2 O 2 , however, inhibits the activity of HRP. Owing to the in situ generation of H 2 O 2 by GOD-catalyzed oxidation of glucose, bienzyme biosensors with HRP and GOD co-immobilization is inherently attractive [3,8,9] . New method to immobilize HRP/GOD on electrodes is of great significance for improving the performance of the bienzyme biosensor. Compared with the usually used covalent immobilization or incorporation into sol\u2013gel derived matrix, layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique represents an interesting and attractive alternative due to its simplicity and versatility. Moreover, ultrathin multilayer films with high-level order on a molecular scale could be obtained [10\u201313] . Despite electrostatic interaction usually used for LBL assembly, strongly biospecific affinity between lectin concanavalin A (Con A) and sugar residues of sugar-proteins can be used for constructing multilayer thin films using native biomolecules [8,14\u201315] . For example, Kobayashi and Anzai prepared HRP or GOD multilayer films on the surface of glassy carbon electrode (GC) through biospecific affinity between Con A and sugar chains intrinsically located on the surface of HRP and GOD. Results showed that HRP and GOx retained their catalytic activity in the multilayer film. In the presence of methylene blue, the modified electrodes served as a glucose sensor by response to in situ generated H 2 O 2 . The initial recognition Con A interface, however, was deposited only through non-specific adsorption by immersing GC in Con A solution [8] . The introduction of additional interaction between Con A and electrode might be favorable. Moreover, further expansion in bioanalytical application especially in the sensitive and fast determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines should be promising. Using the negative charges of Con A (p I 5.0) at neutral pH, in our recent work, deposition of Con A to polyelectrolyte precursor film-modified Au electrode through electrostatic interaction gave controllable and high-organized Con A film [16] . The consequently constructed HRP-based electrode could be used as a biosensor for the determination of phenolic compounds. In this work, continuing our interest in pursuing new methods for an efficient determination of phenolic and amine compounds, a HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor was constructed based on sugar\u2013lectin biospecific interactions for amperometric determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines. To assemble Con A needed for deposition of HRP or GOD, polyelectrolyte precursor film was prepared on negative charged gold electrode. Atomic force microscopy was applied to monitor the uniform LBL assembly of Con A and HRP or GOD. By oxidation of glucose catalyzed by GOD, the developed HRP/GOD biosensor allows the in situ generation of H 2 O 2 needed for the determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines. Due to strongly biospecific affinity for assembly and the prevention of negative effect that high H 2 O 2 concentration has on HRP activity, the immobilized HRP exhibited high activity and the biosensor possessed high sensitivity and good stability. 2 Experimental 2.1 Reagents Horseradish peroxidase (E.C.1.11.1.7, 250 U mg \u22121 ) was purchased from Shanghai Lizhu Dongfeng Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Glucose oxidase (E.C.1.1.3.4, 200 U mg \u22121 ) and Concanavalin A from Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) were purchased from Sigma. Poly(sodium- p -styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) were from Acros. Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid, sodium salt (MPS) were from Aldrich. All other reagents were of an analytical grade and used without further purification. Polyelectrolyte solutions, polycation PAH and polyanion PSS, were both 1 mg mL \u22121 in glycine\u2013NaOH buffer (pH 12.0) containing 0.4 mol L \u22121 NaCl. 2.2 Apparatus and electrodes Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained on a Nanoscopy IVA system (Digital Instruments Inc.). Electrochemical measurements were performed with an LK98APLUS electrochemical analytical system (Tianjin Lanlike Chemical&Electronica High-technology Co., Tianjin, China). A conventional three-electrode system was used with bare gold electrode or modified gold electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated with KCl) as the reference electrode, and platinum disk electrode as auxiliary electrode. 2.3 Preparation of HRP/GOD bienzyme electrode Before use, the bare gold electrode was successively polished with emery paper and 0.05 \u03bcm \u03b1-Al 2 O 3 slurry. After sonicated in deionized water for 1 min, the electrode was immersed in freshly prepared Piranha solution (30% H 2 O 2 and concentrated H 2 SO 4 , 3:1 (v/v)) for 10 min. After ultrasonical rinsing, the electrode was electrochemically pre-treated by cyclic potential scanning between 1.4 V and \u22120.2 V in 0.1 mol L \u22121 H 2 SO 4 until cyclic voltammogram of clean gold electrode was obtained. Afterwards, the clean gold electrode was immersed in 0.02 mol L \u22121 MPS aqueous solution for 10 h to form a monolayer with negative charge. Then, the MPS-modified electrode was alternately dipped into the polycation PAH and the polyanion PSS solution for 20 min to form a PAH/PSS/PAH precursor film. Using the net negative charges of Con A at a neutral pH [14] , the first layer of Con A could be assembled on PAH/PSS/PAH precursor film through electrostatic interaction with polycation PAH. Typically, the electrode was dipped into a Con A solution (0.3 mg mL \u22121 in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS, containing 1 mmol L \u22121 CaCl 2 and 1 mmol L \u22121 MnCl 2 , pH 7.0) for 30 min. Afterwards, the obtained electrode was immersed in HRP or GOD solution (0.5 mg mL \u22121 in PBS, pH 7.0) for 60 min to deposit enzyme layer through biospecific Con A\u2013sugar interaction. By alternate dipping the electrode in Con A and enzyme solution, the deposition was repeated to prepare (Con A/HRP) n or (Con A/GOD) n multilayers. The procedure for constructing the HRP/GOD bienzyme electrode was schematically shown in Fig. 1 . 2.4 Preparation of HRP/GOx multilayer films on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) membrane The cleaned PET was first treated in 1.5 mol L \u22121 NaOH for 20 min to create a negatively charged surface [30]. Afterwards, HRP/GOx multilayer films were assembled on the negatively charged PET using the identical procedure described for the assembly on MPS-modified gold electrode. Negatively charged PET, and membrane obtained after each assembly was used for AFM characterization. 2.5 Electrochemical measurements The HRP/GOD bienzyme-modified electrode was immersed in the supporting electrolyte (PBS, pH 7.0) containing appropriate concentration of glucose at room temperature. The solution was mechanically stirred at a constant rate. The amperometric response was obtained at \u22120.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl and typical steady-state response of the biosensor to successive injection of phenolic compounds or aromatic amines was recorded. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation of the HRP/GOD bienzyme electrode In present investigation, the strategy for the preparation of HRP/GOD bienzyme electrode involved four steps, as shown in Fig. 1 . Firstly, interaction between gold electrode and mercapto compound, MPS, was used to form a uniform and tightly attached monolayer on gold electrode. Due to the presence of sulfonic groups, negative-charge-modified gold electrode was obtained. Secondly, a PAH/PSS/PAH polyelectrolyte precursor film was prepared on MPS-modified electrode. Thirdly, Con A was deposited on the PAH/PSS/PAH precursor film through electrostatic interaction between its negative charges at neutral pH and polycation PAH. Fourthly, Con A/HRP or Con A/GOD multilayers were formed based on biospecific binding between Con A and sugar chains on the surface of HRP or GOD. The mechanisms for the determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines using HRP-modified electrode were similar [2,7] . Scheme of mechanism for the determination of phenolic compounds was given as a model in the supplementary material . As shown, H 2 O 2 is needed for the determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines. By oxidation of glucose catalyzed by GOD, the developed HRP/GOD biosensor allows the in situ generation of H 2 O 2 . When the substrates (phenolic compounds or aromatic amines) were present, the catalytic cycle of HRP was driven forward. When the consumption of H 2 O 2 increased, more peroxide was generated by enzymatic reaction of GOD. Consequently, only the required amount of H 2 O 2 was generated at the electrode surface and its inhibitory effect on HRP was minimized or prevented. Kobayashi et al. investigated the effect of the number of enzyme layers and the sequence of immobilization in the multilayer film. Results showed that the electrode with HRP multilayers was coated first and GOD multilayers immobilized as an outer layer could obtain higher performance. As a result, a (Con A/HRP) n \u2013(Con A/GOD) n design was also adopted in this work. The effect of the number of HRP layers or GOD layers on the response of the biosensors was evaluated using electrodes modified with (Con A/HRP) n \u2013(Con A/GOD) n , where n = 2\u20134. For (Con A/HRP) n \u2013(Con A/GOD) 2 -modified electrode, the sensitivity did not increase linearly when the HRP layers increased from two to four. A HRP bilayer, (Con A/HRP) 2 \u2013(Con A/GOD) n was chosen. For (Con A/HRP) 2 \u2013(Con A/GOD) n -modified electrode, the same results was obtained and a GOD bilayer was applied. As a result, (Con A/HRP) 2 \u2013(Con A/GOD) 2 was used to fabricate the bienzyme biosensor. The biosensor was donated as HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor. 3.2 Characterization of the LBL assembly Atomic force microscopy was applied to monitor the uniform LBL assembly of Con A and HRP or GOD. Tapping mode AFM was employed to investigate the morphology of negatively charged PET, polyelectrolyte precursor film-modified PET, Con A-modified PET, HRP, and modified PET, and HRP/GOD bienzyme-modified PET. Fig. 2 shows the AFM image of the negatively charged PET. The surface of the negatively charged PET was smooth and root mean square roughness (RMS) was 1.17 nm. AFM images of PET/PAH/PSS/PAH, PET/PAH/PSS/PAH/Con A, PET/PAH/PSS/PAH/Con A/HRP, and PET/PAH/PSS/PAH/(Con A/HRP) 2 /(Con A/GOD) 2 was shown in Fig. 3 . Compared with PET membrane, the surface of polyelectrolyte precursor film-modified PET, PET/PAH/PSS/PAH, demonstrated significant difference. A rough morphology appeared and the RMS increased to 8.73 nm. When Con A was consequently assembled, Con A filled in the porous structure of the polyelectrolyte precursor film. As a result, the RMS of PET/PAH/PSS/PAH/Con A decreased to 7.04 nm. When HRP and GOD assembled, the surface also emerged grainy embossment. The distribution of HRP was uniform and the smooth surface became slightly smooth. The RMS of HRP and GOx layer was 6.02 nm and 5.86 nm, respectively. 3.3 Effect of concentration of glucose on the sensitivity of the biosensor The concentration of glucose in the supporting medium was also optimized. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the glucose concentration on the HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor for the detection of catechol. At low concentration, the sensitivity of the biosensor increased with the increase of glucose concentration. A constant was obtained when concentration of glucose was higher than 6.0 mmol L \u22121 . Thus, 6.0 mmol L \u22121 glucose was chosen for further investigation. 3.4 The analytical characteristics of the biosensor for the detection of phenolic compounds The response of the bienzyme biosensor to successive additions of 6.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 catechol was given in Fig. 5 . When aliquots of catechol were successively added, a clearly defined reduction current proportional to the catechol concentration was observed. The linear response ranged from 6.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 to 60.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 . The regression equation was I = 0.0776 C + 0.2209 with a good correlation coefficient of 0.998 ( n = 10). I was the response current of the bienzyme electrode (\u03bcA) and C represented the concentration of target catechol (\u03bcmol L \u22121 ). The linear range was better than that reported in the literature [16] . The sensitivity was 76.82 nA L \u03bcmol \u22121 . It was higher than 50 nA cm \u22122 L \u03bcmol \u22121 of multi-wall carbon nanotube-based HRP biosensor [17] , 8.1 nA L \u03bcmol \u22121 of graphite-based HRP biosensor [18] , 38 nA L \u03bcmol \u22121 of silica-based HRP biosensor [7] , and 48.91 nA L \u03bcmol \u22121 of LBL electrostatic assembled HRP biosensor [2] . It indicated that the immobilized HRP has a higher catalytic activity and the more biocompatible microenvironment around the enzyme. The detection limit was 0.9 \u03bcmol L \u22121 obtained using a signal to noise ratio of 3. Due to the uniform LBL assembly, additionally, the response time for the biosensor was very short and 95% of its maximum response could be reached in about 3 s. The repeatability of the measurements, expressed as the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.), was 2.3% for 10 successive experiments in the presence of 24.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 of catechol. The HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor was also used for the detection of different phenolic compounds. The sensitivity of HRP-based biosensor depended on the stability of the phenoxy radicals produced in the enzyme reaction, electrode material, HRP immobilization method and the magnitude of the applied potential [7] . For the detection of different phenolic compounds, the trend of the sensitivity was consistent with the ability of the substituents for forming electron-donor conjugation. Usually, stronger ability of electron-donor conjugation resulted in higher sensitivity for the detection. The relative response and sensitivity of the HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor was investigated for different phenolic compounds. Results were compared with those obtained using five bilayers of PAH/HRP-modified electrode [2] , as summarized in Table 1 . Such five bilayers of PAH/HRP, (PAH/HRP) 5 , modified electrode was prepared using LBL electrostatic assembly between HRP and PAH. The rule of the sensitivities of the bienzyme electrode for different phenolic compounds was consistent with that of (PAH/HRP) 5 -modified electrode. For quercitrin, catechol, hydroquinone, o -aminophenol and o -chlorophenol, the corresponding conjugation structures could be easily formed because of strong ability for forming electron-donor conjugation of the substituents. While the ability to form the conjugation structures was slightly lower for m -hydroxy and methyl groups of resorcinol and o -cresol, low sensitivity was obtained as a result. 3.5 The analytical characteristics of the biosensor for detection of different aromatic amines The response of the bienzyme biosensor to successive additions of 7.6 \u03bcmol L \u22121 p- phenylenediamine was given in Fig. 6 . The linear range was from 7.6 \u03bcmol L \u22121 to 68.4 \u03bcmol L \u22121 . The regression equation was I = 0.1518 C + 1.1581 with a correlation coefficient of 0.991 ( n = 9). I was the response current of the bienzyme electrode (\u03bcA) and C represented the concentration of target p- phenylenediamine (\u03bcmol L \u22121 ). The detection limit was 0.4 \u03bcmol L \u22121 . The HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor was also used for the detection of different aromatic amines. The linear range, sensitivity and detection limit for p -phenylenediamine, o -phenylenediamine, m -phenylenediamine and aniline were illustrated in Table 2 . Significant difference in sensitivity could be found for the detection of different aromatic amines. The trend was given as follows: p -phenylenediamine > o -phenylenediamine > m -phenylenediamine > aniline. It was also consistent with the ability for forming the electron-donor conjugation of the substituents. In the case of p -phenylenediamine and o -phenylenediamine, the electron-donor conjugation effect of the substituents stabilized the resulting radicals produced in the enzyme reaction. The sensitivities for these two substrates were higher than those for m -phenylenediamine and aniline. The result was in agreement with those obtained on graphite-based HRP electrode [18] and graphite\u2013Teflon electrode [3] . Moreover, the HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor exhibited higher sensitivities for the detection of different aromatic amines than graphite-based HRP electrode [18] . 3.6 Effect of interferences Enzymatic electrodes may give wrong results when used in complex media containing interferences. The possible interferences such as glucose, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and starch on the determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines were studied at the developed HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor. As shown in Fig. 7 , when 6.0 mmol L \u22121 glucose, 300 \u03bcmol L \u22121 ascorbic acid, 6.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 catechol (or 7.6 \u03bcmol L \u22121 phenylenediamine) were orderly added in the supporting PBS, no significant interference was found. Tartaric acid, citric acid and starch were also measured when their concentrations were 50-folds of catechol or p- phenylenediamine. Results shown that those compounds did not interfere with the calibration assay (data not shown for brief). It is clear from above results that the developed HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor can offer high selectivity. 3.7 Stability of the HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor The stability of the HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor was evaluated by monitoring the response currents in the presence of 24.0 \u03bcmol L \u22121 catechol, over a 4-week period. The electrode was stored at 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator when not used. The response was constant for the first week. After 4 weeks, the biosensor retained about 78% of its original response. The stability was better than that with the sol\u2013gel derived HRP biosensors [19,20] and LBL electrostatic assembled HRP biosensor [2] . The results might be ascribed to strong biospecific affinity for assembly and the prevention of negative effect that high H 2 O 2 concentration has on HRP activity [21] . 4 Conclusions An amperometric HRP/GOD bienzyme biosensor was developed based on LBL self-assembling of Con A and native HRP or GOD for the determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines with the in situ generation of H 2 O 2 . AFM was used to monitor the uniform LBL assembly between polyelectrolyte precursor film and Con A, Con A and HRP or GOD. The biosensor with uniform multilayers demonstrated success for the determination of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines with high sensitivity and fast response. Glucose and ascorbic acid exhibited no interference to the determination. Due to strong biospecific affinity for assembly and the prevention of negative effect of high H 2 O 2 concentration on HRP activity, the biosensor possessed high stability.

        "abstract": "Gemcitabine is an important pyrimidine antimetabolite that inhibits cellular DNA synthesis. However, the therapeutic efficacy and clinical benefit of gemcitabine are severely compromised due to its rapid plasma metabolism and low selectivity towards tumor tissues. To overcome these limitations, we prepared novel PEGylated gemcitabine-contained comb-like copolymers poly(monomethoxyl PEG350 methylacrylate -co- 5'-O-vinyladipyl- gemcitabine) (poly(mPEG350MA-co-VAG) and (poly(mPEG1000MA-co-VAG), which could self-assemble into micelles and displayed enhanced antitumor activity. The copolymers and the formed micelles were well characterized for their structure, critical aggregation concentration (CAC), morphology, cellular uptake, cell cytotoxicity, and controlled drug release. Cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity assays against human lung cancerous cells (A549) demonstrated that these micelles could be effectively internalized and induced cell apoptosis. These micelles efficiently inhibited tumor growth when injected intravenously into A549 cell derived xenograft tumor bearing Balb/C nude mice using a dose of 10mg/kg in terms of reduced tumor volume compared to free gemcitabine. In conclusion, PEGylated micelles could protect gemcitabine from rapid plasma metabolism, provided a sustained release and showed enhanced antitumor activity, thus have the potential to be used as novel anticancer drug delivery vehicle.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Enzymatic multicomponent reactions (MCR) are very powerful for complex organic synthesis with environmentally friendly, highly efficient and selective characters, while sometimes having some unavoidable shortages such as narrow substrate scope and so on. Herein, this work demonstrated how to redesign one previously reported lipase-catalyzed MCR to achieve more broad substrates and more efficient synthesis. Twelve new spirooxazino derivatives with different substitutions were obtained in moderate to good yield, while all of them could not be synthesized using the previous route. Reaction conditions such as enzymes, enzyme concentration, amides and ratio of substrates were screened. Furthermore, particularly interesting is that chiral spirooxazino could also be obtained through a further developed two-enzymatic MCR process in one pot. As a domino process simultaneously constructing six new C-C/N bonds and two rings in only one step, the work will remarkably expand the application scope of enzymatic MCR for simple and green synthesis of complex compounds.",

In recent years, the catalytic promiscuity of many enzymes in unnatural reactions has been revealed and studied by chemists and biochemists, which has expanded the application potential of enzymes. To enhance the selectivity and activity of enzymes in their natural or promiscuous reactions, many methods have been recommended, such as protein engineering, process engineering, and media engineering. Among them, the additive approach is very attractive because of its simplicity to use and high efficiency. In this paper, we will review the recent developments about the applications of additives to improve the catalytic performances of enzymes in their natural and promiscuous reactions. These additives include water, organic bases, water mimics, cosolvents, crown ethers, salts, surfactants, and some particular molecular additives.",

In this strategy, the synthesized adamantine-modified primary antibodies (ADA-Ab 1 ) were immobilized on the IDEs functionalized with carboxymethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (CM-\u03b2-CD). After the immuno reaction between Ab 1  and CEA, the polyaniline-Au nanoparticles-labeled antibody (PANi-Au NPs-Ab 2 ) as a signal tag was captured onto the immunosensor and connected the microgap of IDEs, which led to the resistance value decrease of IDEs greatly. In addition, the bottom of the immuno platform decorated with CD, Ab 1  and CEA was fully insulated and the electrochemical response only depended on the number of PANi-Au NPs-Ab 2  which was exactly proportional to CEA. The fabricated immunosensor detected CEA with a wide linear range from 0.1\u00a0ng/mL to 1000\u00a0ng/mL and low detection limit (0.007\u00a0ng/mL), and provides an enormous application potential for clinical analysis.",

        "abstract": "Most of reported synthesis approaches for poly(ester amide)s suffer from the difficulty in controlling the sequence of amino acid and ester units, and also some environmental disadvantages. Herein, we developed a facile approach for the lipase-catalyzed synthesis of chiral L-/D-Asp-based poly(ester amide)s with alternating aspartate and hydroxyhexanoic acid (HA) units. In the Novozym 435-catalyzed polycondensation starting from four monomers, namely N-(6-hydroxyhexanoyl) aspartate diesters with an L- or D-aspartate configuration, and methyl or benzyl ester groups at the \u03b1 or \u03b2-carbonyl positions of Asp, we successfully obtained the corresponding alternating poly(HA-alt-L/D-\u03b2-aspartate)s with \u03b1-benzyl or \u03b1-methyl ester groups. The L-aspartate diester monomer was preferred to the D-aspartate diester monomer in the Novozym 435-catalyzed polycondensation, and it also showed high regioselectivity, mainly forming the \u03b2-linkage of the aspartate unit. Among the four poly(ester amide)s, poly(HA-alt-L-\u03b1-benzyl-\u03b2-aspartate) has the highest molar mass of up to 13\u2006000 Da and 98% \u03b2-linkage. The thermal properties and the aggregate microstructures of these alternating poly(HA-alt-L/D-aspartate)s were also compared and some interesting differences were observed. Our results also showed that these enantiopure poly(HA-alt-L/D-aspartate)s did not form a stereocomplex.",

        "abstract": "Enzymatic stereodivergent synthesis to access all possible product stereoisomers bearing multiple stereocenters is relatively undevel-oped, although enzymes are being increasingly used in both academic and industrial areas. When two stereocenters and thus four stereoisomeric products are involved, obtaining stereodivergent enzyme mutants for individually accessing all four stereoisomers would be ideal. Although significant success has been achieved in directed evolution of enzymes in general, stereodivergent engineer-ing of one enzyme into four highly stereocomplementary variants for obtaining the full complement of stereoisomers bearing multi-ple stereocenters remains a challenge. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a model, we report the protein engineering of this enzyme into four highly stereocomplementary variants needed for obtaining all four stereoisomers in transesterification reactions between racemic acids and racemic alcohols in organic solvents. By generating and screening less than 25 variants each isomer, we achieved >90% selectivity for all of the four possible stereoisomers in the model reaction. This difficult feat was accomplished by developing a strategy dubbed \"focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis\" (FRISM) at sites lining the enzyme's binding pocket. The accumulation of single mutations by iterative site-specific mutagenesis using a restricted set of rationally chosen amino acids allows the formation of ultra-small mutant libraries requiring minimal screening for stereoselectivity. The crystal structure of all stereodivergent CALB variants, flanked by MD simulations, uncovered the source of selectivity.",

In the TEA-WT CALB catalysis system, WT CALB displays excellent S enantioselectivity for a series of MBH acetates tested (up to 96% ee and 98% conversion).

        "abstract": "Optically active polymeric prodrugs containing saccharides were prepared via a facile procedure combining enzymatic resolution with chemical polymerization. Polymerizable optically active chlorphenesin derivatives were obtained in excellent optically purity (ee > 99.9%) and high yield (\u223c50%) in short time (\u223c4 h) by lipase-catalyzed resolution after optimization of reaction conditions. Then, polymerizable optically active monomer was copolymerized with different polymerizable glycolipids using free radical polymerization method. The obtained optically active polymeric prodrugs bearing ( R )-chlorphenesin residue were characterized by IR, NMR and GPC. In vitro released studies showed that the cumulative released optically pure chlorphenesin (ee = 88\u201392%) from the polymeric prodrug (VADG) was from 19.3% to 34.3% in pH 7.4, pH 5.4 and pH 1.2 after 7 days. The cumulative liberation rate of optically active polymeric prodrugs (ee = \u223c88%) with different glycolipids was from 26.4% to 38.5% in pH 1.2. Graphical abstract Keywords Copolymer Lipase-catalyzed resolution Optically active 1 Introduction In recent years, much attention has been focused on the design of polymeric prodrugs or polymer\u2013drug conjugates because the drug released from the polymers increases the duration of drug activity and improves the targeting ability of polymeric prodrug in the body [1\u20137] . Several polymer-based pharmaceutical products have achieved both improved clinical outcomes and considerable market success [8] . However, there are few reports about the synthesis of optically active polymeric prodrugs starting from the racemic mixture of chiral drugs [9] , though there are some researches on optical active polymers [10] . In particular, it has been an attractive and significative topic for the synthesis of polymeric prodrugs of optically active drugs with biocompatible moieties. Biocompatibility is an important factor for application of macromolecular drugs [8,11] . Saccharides play a central role in living systems due to their biological recognition, functional biomolecular and excellent biocompatibility. The combinations of carbohydrates with other specific molecules provide much opportunity for developing new drug types and improving diseases therapy effect [12\u201318] . A great number of drugs in use today rely on carbohydrates as their important parts. As a result, the synthesis of polymeric prodrugs of optically active drugs containing saccharides is especially desirable [19] . Considerable efforts have been made to prepare optically active drugs by enzymatic resolution due to their high selectivity, mild reaction conditions and simplified downstream processing [20\u201327] . Our group has achieved successfully the enzymatic resolution of vinyl esters of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and prepared optical active polymeric prodrugs of NSAIDs with MMA [9,28] . In addition, a series of racemic polymerizable chlorphenesin monomers have been successfully synthesized [19,29] . However, the polymeric prodrugs of optically active drugs with saccharide branch and their in vitro sustained release haven't been investigated. In this present work, polymerizable optically active chlorphenesin derivatives were obtained with excellent optical purity and in high yield in short time by lipase-catalyzed resolution. Then, we developed the efficient chemo-enzymatic method to prepare polymeric prodrugs of optically active chlorphenesin with glycolipids. Furthermore, the length of linker and pH value of incubation medium were found to have important influence on the release rate of chlorphenesin through in vitro release experiments. The investigation of the ee value of the residue chlorphenesin from polymeric prodrugs showed that the stereoselectivity of chlorphenesin remained after the sustained release of optically active polymeric prodrugs. This strategy can provide possibility to design other novel multifunctional polymeric prodrugs with optically active drugs. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Lipozyme \u00ae (E.C. 3.1.1.1, an immobilized preparation of lipase from Mucor miehei ), lipase from porcine pancreas (E.C. 3.1.1.3, Type II, powder), Candida antarctica lipase acrylic resin (E.C. 3.1.1.3) and lipase Type VII from Candida rugosa (E.C. 3.1.1.3, powder) were purchased from Sigma. Lipase PS \u201cAmano\u201d (E.C. 3.1.1.3, powder) and lipase PS\u2013C \u201cAmano\u201d (E.C. 3.1.1.3, an immobilized preparation of lipase of Burkholderia cepacia ) were purchased from Aldrich. Alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis (E.C. 3.4.21.14, a crude preparation of the alkaline serine protease, powder) was purchased from Wuxi Enzyme Co. Ltd (Wuxi, P.R. China). Chlorphenesin was purchased from Alfa Aesar, a Johnson Matthey Company. All the enzymes were used directly in commercial preparations without further purification. 2,2\u2032-Azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was purified by recrystallization with methanol and dried at room temperature under vacuum. All solvents were of analytical grade and were dried by storing over activated 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves before use. All other reagents were used as received. 2.2 Analytical methods The process of reactions was monitored by TLC on silica. The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with TMS as internal standard using a Bruker AMX-500 MHz spectrometer. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm and coupling constants ( J ) in Hz. IR spectra were measured with a Nicolet Nexus FTIR 670 spectrophotometer. Analytical HPLC was performed using an Agilent 1100 series with a reversed-phase Shim-Pack VP-ODS column (150 \u00d7 4.6 mm) and a UV detector (275 nm). Methanol/water (80/20, v/v) was used as a mobile phase, while the flow rate was adjusted to 1 mL min \u22121 . GPC was performed with a system equipped with refractive-index detector (Waters 2410) and Waters Styragel GPC columns. The GPC columns were standardized with narrow dispersity polystyrene in molecular weights ranging from 4.7 \u00d7 10 6 to 2350. The mobile phase was tetrahydrofuran at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min \u22121 . The enantiomers of chlorphenesin were analyzed using an Agilent 1100 series with a chiral column (Chiral OD-H Column No. ODH0-EA031 (DAICEL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD.)) and were detected at 275 nm. The mobile phase was n -hexane/isopropanol (85/15, v/v) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min \u22121 . 2.3 Synthesis of ( R , S )-chlorphenesin vinyl ester and d -glucose derivatives Racemic polymerizable chlorphenesin derivatives were synthesized by enzymatic transesterification of chlorphenesin ( 1 ) and divinyl adipate using Lipozyme \u00ae as catalyst in anhydrous acetone at 50 \u00b0C under 250 rpm [29] . When alkaline protease from B. subtilis was employed as catalyst in pyridine, polymerizable sugar derivatives were prepared using the same method. By selective enzymatic synthesis, we prepared racemic polymerizable chlorphenesin derivative and three polymerizable glucose derivatives, 6- O -vinyladipyl-chlorphenesin (OVAC, 2 ), 6- O -vinylsuccinyl- d -glucose (VSUG, a ), 6- O -vinyladipyl- d -glucose (VADG, b ) and 6- O -vinylsebacyl- d -glucose (VSEG, c ) [30] . 2.4 Synthesis of optically active polymerizable chlorphenesin vinyl ester The synthesis of ( R )-chlorphenesin vinyl ester (( R )- 2 ) was catalyzed by PS\u2013C in anhydrous MTBE. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 mg lipase to 10 mL solvent containing 1.0 g racemic chlorphenesin vinyl esters and vinyl acetate (1:2, molar ratio). The suspension was kept at 25 \u00b0C and shaken at 200 rpm. The reaction was detected by HPLC and terminated by filtering off the enzyme. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The products ( S )- 3 and ( R )- 2 were separated by silica gel chromatography with a mobile phase consisting of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (5:2, v/v) and petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (2:1, v/v), respectively. The product was analyzed by IR and NMR. 2.5 ( R )-1- O -Vinyladipoyl-chlorphenesin (( R )-OVAC, ( R )- 2 ) 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 (ppm): 7.27 (dd, 1H, J = 6.3 Hz, J = 14.1 Hz, \u2013CH ), 7.22 (d, 2H, Ar\u2013H), 6.84 (d, 2H, Ar\u2013H), 4.88 (dd, 1H, J = 14.1 Hz, J = 6.3 Hz, CH 2 ), 4.57 (dd, 1H, J = 6.3 Hz, J = 1.5 Hz, CH 2 ), 4.32\u20134.21 (m, 3H, \u2013C H (OH)C H 2 \u2013), 3.98 (m, 2H, \u2013OC H 2 CH\u2013), 3.05 (br, 1H, \u2013CH(O H )\u2013), 2.39 (m, 4H, 2-CH 2 \u2013), 1.68 (m, 4H, 2-CH 2 \u2013). 13 C NMR (CDCl 3 ): \u03b4 (ppm): 173.5, 170.6 (C O), 157.1, 129.5, 129.5, 126.3, 116.0, 116.0 (Ar, chlorphenesin), 141.2 (\u2013O\u2013CH ), 98.0 ( CH 2 ), 69.2 (C\u20133, chlorphenesin), 68.5 (C\u20132, chlorphenesin), 65.4 (C\u20131, chlorphenesin), 33.8, 33.5, 24.3, 24.0 (\u2013CH 2 \u2013).

In vitro drug release experiments were carried out as follows: the resultant polymeric prodrug (10 mg, ( R )- 4a , ( R )- 4b or ( R )- 4c ) was added to 1 mL incubation medium (pH 7.4, 0.2 M Na 2 HPO 4 \u201312H 2 O/NaH 2 PO 4 \u20132H 2 O buffer solution, pH 5.4, 0.2 M HAc/NaAc buffer solution, or pH 1.2, 0.1 M HCl/NaCl/glycine solution) and subsequently placed in a dialysis membrane (MWCO = 3500 Da) for release studies. The dialysis membrane was then placed in a 10 mL bottle with 5 mL corresponding incubation solution and the medium was stirred at 100 rpm at 37 \u00b0C. At set time intervals, the whole medium (5 mL) was taken and replaced with the same volume of fresh solution. The products released from the polymeric prodrugs were analyzed by HPLC with a UV\u2013vis detector and a reversed-phase Shim-Pack VP-ODS column (150 \u00d7 4.6 mm). A mixture of methanol and water (v/v = 80/20) was employed as the mobile phase, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL min \u22121 . The detection wavelength was 275 nm. The concentration of the chlorphenesin released in incubation solution was determined by an Analytikjena SPECORD 200 UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer at 275 nm. The ee values of released drugs from polymeric prodrugs were detected by HPLC with a chiral column. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Optimization for the synthesis of polymerizable optically active chlorphenesin Optically active polymers can be prepared from optically active monomers [31\u201333] . Enzymatic resolution is a facile and useful approach to synthesize optically active compounds. In this study, six commercial enzymes were selected to prepare drug monomers with high ee value. There was no reaction without enzyme participation, and it was proved that the biocatalyst was the critical factor in this enzymatic resolution reaction. From Table 1 , lipase PS showed moderate enantioselectivity ( E = 21.5, C \u223c 14%) at 6 h, and lipase PS\u2013C was the most effective for enzymatic resolution in organic solvent, which showed highest enantioselectivity ( E > 100). The conversion of reaction reached 54.5% and ee s was more than 99.9% at 6 h. The catalytic activity and enantioselectivity were much better than previous experiment results [34] . It was proved that immobilized enzyme was much stable in the organic solvent and retained much more catalytic reactivity during the reaction procedure. In addition, the reactivity of racemic OVAC was higher due to the vinyl group of OVAC. The other lipases in this research showed poor catalytic reactivity and low enantionselectivity ( E < 4). As shown in Table 1 , Lipozyme \u00ae and CRL selected R configuration of chlorphenesin vinyl ester (OVAC), while lipase PS\u2013C, PS, CAL-B and PPL selected S configuration of substrate in the reaction, because enzymes derived from various sources showed different properties, such as activity and specificity. It gave the opportunity for the preparation of optically active monomers with different enantiomers. In this paper, lipase PS\u2013C was chosen as the most efficient lipase for further investigation. Improvement in the lipase catalytic activity and selectivity can be made by changing the solvents [35\u201337] . Eight organic solvents were investigated in order to prepare the optically active monomers efficiently and fast ( Table 2 ). The lipase-catalyzed resolution of racemic OVAC is better in organic solvent with low polarity than in polar solvent. The ee values of ( R )-OVAC were more than 99.9% in n -hexane and MTBE, and MTBE was selected for the lipase-catalyzed resolution of OVAC due to its well solubility for substrates and higher reaction rate. The influence of the reaction temperature on the lipase-catalyzed resolution of OVAC in MTBE was investigated. As shown in Table 3 , higher temperature caused lower enantiomeric excess value of OVAC but higher conversion. The E -value at 5 \u00b0C was the highest ( E > 300) and that at 50 \u00b0C was only 6 as the enzyme was partly inactive in high temperature, while the reaction conversion at 5 \u00b0C was only about 35% after 4 h. Despite high enantiomeric excess observed at low temperature, the reaction rate was much slower than that at higher temperature. Considering the two factors, the optimal temperature in terms of enantioselectivity and conversion was 25 \u00b0C, which is close to ambient and thus environmentally benign. Time process of lipase-catalyzed resolution of rac - 1 is shown in Fig.\u00a01 . The reaction conversion reached \u223c50% after 3 h and the enantioselectivity E was more than 200. The high catalytic reactivity and enantioselectivity was observed in lipase-catalyzed resolution of racemic OVAC in MTBE using lipase PS\u2013C as biocatalyst in 4 h. The E -value decreased with the reaction proceeding after 4 h. The optimal reaction condition was 25 \u00b0C, lipase PS\u2013C, MTBE, 4 h for the synthesis of optically active monomers. 3.2 Synthesis and characterization of polymer prodrugs with optically active chlorphenesin branches Drug-containing monomer, optically active chlorphenesin, was copolymerized with a series of polymerizable glycolipids with different linkers in dried DMF solution by free radical technique at 70 \u00b0C using AIBN as initiator ( Scheme 1 ). The structure of the optically active copolymers with different linker glycolipids was characterized with FT-IR, NMR and GPC. Taking poly-(OVAC- co -VADG) ( 4b ) for example, in IR spectra, 3101 cm \u22121 and 1646 cm \u22121 assigned to the vibration bands of double bond in the optically active OVAC (( R )- 2 ) disappeared, and the absorption at 1596 cm \u22121 , 1582 cm \u22121 , 827 cm \u22121 were assigned to the aromatic ring of the ( R )- 2 . 3419 cm \u22121 , 1170 cm \u22121 and broad 1057 cm \u22121 were assigned to glycolipid ( b ). The results confirmed the structure of the synthesized polymers. NMR of 4b revealed the disappearance of vinyl group ( 1 H NMR: \u03b4 7.27, 4.88, 4.57; 13 C NMR: \u03b4 141.2, 98.0) and existence of ( R )- 2 ( 1 H NMR: \u03b4 7.22, 6.84; 13 C NMR: \u03b4 157.1, 129.5, 129.5, 126.3, 116.0, 116.0, 70.1, 67.8, 66.2), d -glucose groups ( 1 H NMR: \u03b4 5.03\u20133.45; 13 C NMR: \u03b4 97.6, 93.0, 77.4, 75.5, 74.3, 74.1, 73.0, 71.3, 71.0, 70.2, 46.8) and poly(vinyl alcohol) main chain ( 1 H NMR: \u03b4 2.39\u20131.66; 13 C NMR: \u03b4 34.0). The polymeric prodrug 4a has molecular weight with M n of 1.86 \u00d7 10 4 , and M w / M n of 2.36, 4b has\u00a0molecular weight with M n of 1.05 \u00d7 10 4 , and M w / M n of 1.35 and\u00a0 4c has molecular weight with M n of 2.65 \u00d7 10 4 , and M w / M n of 2.95. According to the calculation from the NMR spectra, the ratio of\u00a0( R )- 2 to a \u2013 c monomers in copolymer was 0.88:1, 0.85:1 and 0.87:1. The loadup of ( R )- 2 of the three optically active polymeric prodrugs was 26.8 wt% 4a , 24.8 wt% 4b and 23.6 wt% 4c , respectively. 3.3 In vitro sustained release of polymeric prodrugs The side chain hydrolysis of polymers with drug-pendent depends on the strength and chemical nature of the drug\u2013polymer chemical bonds and the surrounding conditions [38] . In this research, in vitro hydrolysis behavior of the optically active polymeric prodrugs was studied in three incubation media: pH 1.2 glycine solutions (simulated gastric juice), pH 5.4 acetate solutions and pH 7.4 phosphate solution (simulated extracellular fluids) at 37 \u00b0C. HPLC was employed for the qualitative analysis of the released product. The released drug of 4b in different pH solutions passed through the dialysis membrane into the external buffer solution and was detected by UV spectrophotometer at 275 nm. The curves are shown in Fig.\u00a02 . It was found that in vitro release rate of 4b was relative to the pH value of incubation solution. In pH 1.2 acidic solutions, the liberation rate of 4b was faster than that in pH 5.4 acetate solution and pH 7.4 phosphate solutions. The cumulative release drug from 4b in pH 1.2 solutions was 34.3% after 7 days, while that in pH 5.4 acetate solution and pH 7.4 phosphate solutions was 21.5% and 19.3%, respectively. It was because that the ester bond could more easily undergo hydrolysis in acidic medium. The product was confirmed as ( R )-chlorphenesin with the ee value of 88\u201392% by HPLC with a chiral column after the product was dried in vacuum. Drug liberation rate could be widely controlled by changing the relative length of linker between drug and polymer main chain [39] . Three optically active polymeric prodrugs bearing glycolipids with different linkers were selected to investigate the influence of linker length of monomers on in vitro release rate of drug. Fig.\u00a03 shows the optically active polymer\u2013chlorphenesin conjugates in pH 1.2 glycine solution after 7 days, the cumulative released ( R )-chlorphenesin from polymeric prodrugs decreased from 38.5% to 26.4% with the increasing the length of glycolipid monomers. When the linker between polymer backbone and chlorphenesin branch was the same, the relative length of the linker between chlorphenesin and polymer main chain 1 We use the letter \u2018\u2018a\u2019\u2019 to denote the number of methylene units between chlorphenesin and polymer main chain, and \u2018\u2018b\u2019\u2019 was used to denote that between d -glucose and polymer main chain. The value of \u2018\u2018a/b\u2019\u2019 was used to represent the relative length of linkers between chlorphenesin and polymer main chain. 1 was longer, the easier the ester bond connecting chlorphenesin to the linker was exposed to release buffer solution. Therefore, the above results suggested that the sustained-released of polymeric prodrugs could be effeciently controlled by the relative length of linker between drug and polymer main chain. The ee values of ( R )-chlorphenesin released from three optically active polymeric prodrugs 4a \u2013 c were \u223c88% detected by HPLC. The ee value of released drug little depended on the length of glycolipid monomers. 4 Conclusion In this research, we developed a facile and efficient approach to synthesize optically active polymeric prodrugs of chlorphenesin with different linker glycolipids by combining lipase-catalyzed resolution with radical polymerization. High enantioselectivity (ee > 99.9%) and yields (\u223c50%) of polymerizable chorphenesin monomer can be obtained in short reaction time (4 h) after optimization of enzymatic resolution condition. Then, optically active polymeric prodrugs bearing ( R )-chlorphenesin and glycolipids with different linkers were obtained by free radical polymerization, which were characterized by IR, NMR and GPC. In vitro released studies showed that the cumulative released optically pure chlorphenesin (ee = 88\u201392%) from the polymer\u2013chlorphenesin conjugate was 19.3%\u201334.3% in buffer solution with pH 7.4, 5.4 and 1.2 after 7 days. And the sustained release rate of optically active chlorphenesin decreased with increasing the length of glycolipid monomers. These results would be useful for the further research of other optically active polymeric prodrugs prepared from other functional comonomers.

        "abstract": "We established a facile regioselectively chemo-enzymatic synthesis procedure for the preparation of mutual derivatives of nucleosides and pyrimidines by sequential Markovnikov addition and acylation. Firstly, pyrimidine derivatives containing vinyl ester group were synthesized from pyrimidines and divinyl esters through Markovnikov addition catalyzed by K(2)CO(3) in DMSO at 80 degrees C, and the yields were ranged from 50% to 87%. Then regioselective acylation of ribavirin and cytarabine with pyrimidine vinyl ester was catalyzed by CAL-B (immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica) in anhydrous acetone. Reaction conditions of enzymatic acylation including enzyme resource and solvents were optimized. A series of mutual derivatives of nucleosides and pyrimidines were synthesized successfully and characterized with NMR, IR, and HRMS. This chemo-enzymatic protocol involving sequential Markovnikov addition and acylation provided a novel way of synthesizing complicated functional compounds regioselectively which was hard to be achieved either by chemical or by enzymatic methods.",

        "title": "Synthesis of polymeric prodrugs of chlorphenesin with saccharide branches by chemo-enzymatic regioselective strategy",
        "abstract": "A facile and regioselective enzymatic synthesis approach to prepare polymerizable lipophilic chlorphenesin vinyl esters was developed in this research. The influence of different organic solvents, enzyme sources, reaction time and the acylation reagent on the synthesis of chlorphenesin vinyl esters was investigated. Then the polymerizable monomers 1- O -vinylsuccinyl-chlorphenesin (OVSC) and 1- O -vinyladipoyl-chlorphenesin (OVAC) were homopolymerized using AIBN as the initiator. The obtained polymeric prodrugs were characterized with IR, NMR and GPC analyzes. The poly-OVSC has M n of 1.35 \u00d7 10 4 and M w / M n of 1.95, and the poly-OVAC has M n of 2.37 \u00d7 10 4 and M w / M n of 4.30. Moreover, 6- O -vinyladipoyl- d -glucose (OVAG), a biocompatible monomer, was copolymerized with OVSC and OVAC. Polymeric prodrugs of chlorphenesin with saccharide branches were successfully obtained with high molecular weight. Keywords Copolymer Enzymatic synthesis Chlorphenesin 1 Introduction In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing biodegradable polymeric drugs. Generally, macromolecules cannot pass through the capillary walls of normal tissue in contrast to the low-molecular weight compound diffusing into normal and pathological tissues. The endothelial layer of the capillaries in the tumor tissue is fenestrated and leaky so that the entry of macromolecules into tumor tissue takes place in the capillaries where blood flow is diminished and nutrients transfer into the tissue [1\u20133] . Therefore, it is an active research field to prepare macromolecular drugs for increasing therapeutic benefit, controlling the rate of the drug release and minimizing side effects [4\u20139] . On the other hand, as biological recognition signals and functional biomolecules in living systems, saccharides play a central role. A\u00a0great number of drugs in use today rely on carbohydrates for part of their therapeutic action. These combinations of carbohydrates and other specific molecules span a wide range of drug types and diseases [10\u201316] . Moreover, it is particularly effective for the improvement of drugs' dissolution behavior [17] . As a result, the synthesis of polymeric prodrugs containing biocompatible molecules [18] , such as saccharides, is especially desirable. The vast majority of polymers are prepared from rather simple monomer. Nevertheless, the biodegradable polymeric drugs should include structures of complex biocompatible molecules and drugs, which usually contain a large number of functional groups that are nearly indistinguishable chemically. Then, the selective synthesis of polymerizable monomers of biocompatible molecules and drugs is extremely important. However, selective protection/deprotection of polyfunctional compounds is a challenging problem in organic synthesis. Thus, biocatalysts have been widely used to modify some pharmaceutically important compounds and biocompatible molecules due to their high selectivity, mild reaction conditions and simplified downstream processing by using immobilized enzymes [19\u201322] . Many research groups have made great effort in the area of enzymatic modification of drugs [23,24] . Combining the conventional polymerization chemistry [25] with the highly efficient and regioselective enzymatic approaches, this chemo-enzymatic synthetic\u00a0method is attractive for the preparation of polymeric prodrugs. Chlorphenesin (3-(4-chlorophenoxy)-1,2-propanediol) is an orally administered muscle relaxant. It works by blocking nerve impulses (or pain sensations) that are sent to the brain. Chlorphenesin is used, along with rest and physical therapy, to treat injuries and other painful muscular conditions [26\u201328] . It is also an effective antifungal agent. However, chlorphenesin exhibits a short half-life in the blood stream and a high overall clearance rate. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel prodrugs of chlorphenesin. So far, there are only few reports about the synthesis of chlorphenesin prodrugs, especially the chlorphenesin derivatives that carry polymerizable groups, such as vinyl group. These chlorphenesin monomers could be homo- or copolymerized with appropriate monomers,\u00a0especially saccharides, for the preparation of polymeric prodrugs, which increased the parent drugs' stability and prolonged their biological half-life. In the present work, we reported an efficient enzymatic approach for regioselective esterification of chlorphenesin and obtained vinyl esters monomers of chlorphenesin. The chlorphenesin vinyl esters with lipid solubility, as monomers of polymer drugs, would be expected to render them more suitable for diffusion across the lipophilic membranes of the intestinal cells, thus improving intestinal and cellular absorptions [29] . Then, the polymerizable chlorphenesin vinyl esters were homopolymerized with AIBN. In particular, the copolymers with saccharide branches were prepared successfully. Furthermore, the property and function of copolymers would be adjusted by changing the chain length of chlorphenesin vinyl esters and different saccharides. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Lipozyme \u00ae (E.C. 3.1.1.1, an immobilized preparation of lipase from Mucor miehei , 42 U/g), lipase from porcine pancreas (E.C. 3.1.1.3, type II, powder, 30\u201390 U/mg), lipase from Candida cylindracea (E.C. 3.1.1.3, powder, 2.8 U/mg) and lipase from hog pancreas (E.C. 3.1.1.3, powder, 2.4 U/mg) were purchased from Fluka.

Amano lipase M from Mucor javanicus (E.C. 3.1.1.3, powder, 10 U/mg) and Amano protease PS from Aspergillus melleus (E.C. 3.4.21.63, powder, 100 U/mg) were purchased from Aldrich. Lipase AY30 (E.C. 3.1.1.3, powder) was purchased from Acr\u00f6s. Alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis (E.C. 3.4.21.14, a crude preparation of the alkaline serine protease, 100 U/mg) was purchased from\u00a0Wuxi Enzyme Co. Ltd (Wuxi, PR China). Chlorphenesin was purchased from Alfa Aesar, a Johnson Matthey Company. All the enzymes were used directly as commercial preparations without further purification. 2,2\u2032-Azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was purified by recrystallization with methanol. All solvents were of analytical grade and were dried by storing over activated 3 \u00c5 molecular sieves before use. All other reagents were used as received. 2.2 Analytical methods The progress of reactions was monitored by TLC on silica with petroleum ether/EtOAc (2/1, v/v) as solvent, for the monoester compounds ( 3a \u2013 3d ), petroleum ether/EtOAc (3/1, v/v) for the diester compounds ( 4a \u2013 4d ). The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with TMS as internal standard using a Bruker AMX-500 MHz spectrometer. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts were expressed in parts per million and coupling constants ( J ) in Hertz. IR spectra were measured with a Nicolet Nexus FTIR 670 spectrophotometer. Analytical HPLC was performed using an Agilent 1100 series with a reversed-phase Shim-Pack VP-ODS column (150 \u00d7 4.6 mm) and a UV detector (275 nm). Methanol/water (80/20, v/v) was used as a mobile phase, while the flow rate was adjusted to 1 mL min \u22121 . GPC was performed with a system equipped with refractive-index detector (Waters 2410) and Waters Styragel GPC columns. The GPC columns were standardized with narrow dispersity polystyrene in molecular weights ranging from 4.7 \u00d7 10 6 to 2350. The mobile phase was tetrahydrofuran at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min \u22121 . 2.3 General procedure for the synthesis of chlorphenesin vinyl esters The reaction was initiated by adding 15 mg mL \u22121 Lipozyme \u00ae to 20 mL anhydrous acetone containing 5 mmol chlorphenesin and 30 mmol divinyl dicarboxylates ( 1a \u2013 1d ). The suspension was kept at 50 \u00b0C and shaken at 250 rpm. The reaction was monitored by TLC (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 5/2, v/v). The reactions were terminated by filtering off the enzyme and then the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. The products were isolated by silica gel column chromatography with an eluent consisting of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (3/1, v/v).

Based on the general strategy described by Yoshimoto et\u00a0al. [31] , acylation of a hydroxyl group of substrate will lead the O -acylated carbon ( \u2217 CH 2 OCOR) to downfield shift, while the neighboring carbon ( \u2217 CCH 2 OCOR) to upfield shift in 13 C NMR. Characterization of the product 3a by 13 C NMR revealed that chlorphenesin was substituted at primary hydroxyl position. The signals for primary hydroxyl of chlorphenesin shifted downfield from 63.8 ppm to 65.5 ppm and that of neighboring\u00a0secondary hydroxyl shifted upfield from 70.5 ppm to 68.4 ppm. Likewise, analysis of 13 C NMR spectra of other products showed that the products ( 3b \u2013 3d ) substituted at the primary hydroxyl of chlorphenesin. The analysis of 1 H NMR spectra also confirmed the structure of products. Characterization of the product OVAG by 13 C NMR revealed that glucose was substituted at C-6 position, since signals for C-6 shifted downfield and C-5 position shifted upfield compared with d -glucose. These results imply that alkaline protease from B. subtilis shows an effective regioselectivity in the transesterification of glucose with 2b . 3.2 Enzyme screening This study focused on the identification of suitable enzymes for high transesterification activity of chlorphenesin and divinyl dicarboxylates. Ten commercially available enzymes were tested for the transesterification of chlorphenesin with divinyl adipate ( 2b ) in anhydrous acetone at 50 \u00b0C. The screening results are presented and compared in Table 1 . The yield of OVAC was determined by HPLC. The corresponding control reaction in the absence of enzyme resulted in OVAC formation of less than 0.5%, demonstrating that it was the enzyme that played a crucial role in esterification reaction. The yield of OVAC catalyzed by the ten enzymes ranged in 1.9\u201372.5%. The best result was obtained from Lipozyme \u00ae , while alkaline protease from B. subtilis had the lowest activity in the transesterification. It was found that enzymes derived from various sources showed different properties. All investigated enzymes for the transesterification were found to catalyze exclusively the formation of the mono-substituted 1- O -vinyladipoyl-chlorphenesin in the initial reaction stage. 1,2- O -Divinyladipoyl-chlorphenesin ( 4b ) was formed with the increasing reaction time. After 24 h, the yields of 4b were in 0\u20134.5% range with all investigated enzymes (the data was not shown in Table 1 ), and had no obvious increase with extending reaction time. C. antarctica lipase acrylic resin gave the highest yield 4.5% of 4b at 24 h, and Lipozyme \u00ae with the yield of 2.5%. There were no other products detected by HPLC and TLC. Therefore, we selected Lipozyme \u00ae for further investigation. 3.3 Effect of organic solvents Reaction media plays a crucial role in maintaining enzyme catalytic activity and stability [32] . Sixteen different solvents with Log P value ranging from \u22121.3 to 4.9 were screened to optimize the reaction conditions for enzymatic transesterification. The results are shown in Table 2 . In our study, the yields of product varied with solvents. Results indicated that the solvents can be classified into three categories. In the first category of solvents with Log P < 0.6 (entry 1\u20137, Table 2 ), which can dissolve chlorphenesin well, better yields from 72.5% to 40.2% were obtained. It was noteworthy that the highest yield was obtained in anhydrous acetone, which was a solvent with lower toxicity and easier processing. In the second category of solvents with Log P ranging from 0.65 to 2.9, there is no obvious relationship between the yields and Log P of solvents. The yields ranged from 10.8% in toluene to 46.2% in 1,2-dichloroethane. In the last category, which includes more hydrophobic solvents (Log P > 3.0), the reaction was slow and the yield of OVAC was low. It was verified that nonpolar solvents were unsuitable because of poor solubility of chlorphenesin. 3.4 Influence of water content in acetone on the synthesis of OVAC The water content of the reaction medium would be an important factor affecting the activity of enzyme and the yields of products [33] . In the transesterification, more residual water would be favoring the hydrolysis of the ester products. To obtain high yields, the level of the water in the reactions should be maintained as low as possible, but under those conditions, many enzymes are not active. Fig.\u00a01 shows the effect of water content in acetone on the transesterification of chlorphenesin with divinyl adipate catalyzed by Lipozyme \u00ae . In anhydrous acetone, Lipozyme \u00ae brought about the highest yield of OVAC. Then, the yield of OVAC decreased when the content of water increased and the yield was 22.2% with the water content of 5% in acetone. It was presumable that the immobilized enzymes had more stability and less influence on the water content in solvents. 3.5 Influence of the structures of acylation reagents on initial reaction rate and yields The influence of the structures of acylation reagent was evaluated. The enzymatic reactivity decreased as the length of carbon chains of the divinyl dicarboxylates increased. As shown in Table 3 , the initial reaction rate was the highest with 4.73 mM min \u22121 when divinyl succinate was chosen as acylation reagent. However, compared with divinyl succinate, the reactivity of divinyl adipate and divinyl azelate was lower, and the initial reaction rate was 1.85 mM min \u22121 and 1.43 mM min \u22121 , respectively. The activity of divinyl sebacate in the transesterification was the lowest with the initial reaction rate of 0.88 mM min \u22121 ( Fig.\u00a02 ). Similarly, the yield of 3a had already been greater than 81% after 30 min. The yields of 3c \u2013 3d were much lower than that of 3a , which were 58.4% and 53.9% after 4 h, respectively. The yields of 3c \u2013 3d showed no obvious increase with extending reaction time. It was possible that the more sterically hindered divinyl dicarboxylates provided lower yield. 3.6 Preparation of the homopolymer of poly-OVSC and poly-OVAC The use of macromolecular prodrugs allows longer circulation times and gives access to additional chemical functionality or delivery that is more precise. In this study, we carried out the homopolymerization using AIBN as initiator. Products were analyzed by FTIR and NMR. In IR spectra of poly-OVSC ( Fig.\u00a03 ) 3101 cm \u22121 and 1646 cm \u22121 assigned to the vibration bands of double bond in the OVSC disappeared, and the absorption at 3466 cm \u22121 , 1596 cm \u22121 , 1582 cm \u22121 , 1162 cm \u22121 and 825 cm \u22121 was assigned to the aromatic ring of OVSC. As shown in 1 H NMR spectra ( Fig.\u00a04 (b)), as expected, the double bonds of the OVSC monomer was absent in the\u00a0polymer. The aromatic protons appeared at around 7.23\u20136.85 ppm in 1 H NMR of poly-OVSC. Analysis of IR and NMR spectra confirmed the structure of homopolymers. Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis of the polymer from OVSC indicated an M w of 1.35 \u00d7 10 4 and polydispersity of 1.95 (as shown in Fig.\u00a05 ). The polymeric prodrug poly-OVAC has high molecular weight with M n of 2.37 \u00d7 10 4 and M w / M n of 4.30. The loadup of chlorphenesin in poly-OVSC was 61 wt% and that in poly-OVAC was 56 wt%. 3.7 Preparation of the copolymers poly(OVSC- co -OVAG) and poly(OVAC- co -OVAG) As known to all, biopolymers play an essential role. In previous research, we have synthesized a series of polymerizable glycolipids by regioselective enzymatic methods. In this research, we selected polymerizable glucose vinyl esters as monomers for further polymerization, which had good water-solubility and dissolution behavior. The copolymers poly(OVSC- co -OVAG) and poly(OVAC- co -OVAG) were prepared using radical polymerization. In IR spectra of poly-OVSC ( Fig.\u00a03 ), 3101 cm \u22121 and 1646 cm \u22121 assigned to the vibration bands of double bond in the OVSC disappeared, and the absorption at 1596 cm \u22121 , 1582 cm \u22121 and 827 cm \u22121 were assigned to the aromatic ring of OVSC. Absorption at 3419 cm \u22121 , 1170 cm \u22121 and broad 1057 cm \u22121 were assigned to 6- O -vinyladipoyl- d -glucose (OVAG). The result showed that poly(OVSC- co -OVAG) was prepared successfully. 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR of poly(OVSC- co -OVAG) revealed the disappearance of vinyl group and existence of chlorphenesin, d -glucose groups and poly(vinyl alcohol) main chain. The polymeric prodrug poly(OVSC- co -OVAG) has high molecular weight with M n of 4.34 \u00d7 10 4 and M w / M n of 2.15, and poly(OVAC- co -OVAG) has molecular weight with M n of 1.05 \u00d7 10 4 and M w / M n of 1.35. According to the calculation from\u00a0the NMR spectra, the ratio of OVSC (or OVAC) to OVAG monomers in copolymer was 0.85:1. The loadup of chlorphenesin of the two polymeric prodrugs was 26.2 wt% (poly(OVSC- co -OVAG)), and 25.2 wt% (poly(OVAC- co -OVAG)). 4 Conclusion In the present study, we described a highly regioselective enzymatic synthesis approach for the preparation of polymerizable chlorphenesin vinyl esters through the Lipozyme \u00ae -catalyzed transesterification of chlorphenesin with divinyl dicarboxylates in anhydrous acetone. High selectivity and yields can be obtained in short reaction time. The influences of enzyme source, organic solvent, reaction time and the structures of acylation agent on the transesterification were systematically investigated. Moreover, protease-catalyzed regioselective acylation of d -glucose with divinyl adipate provided a biocompatible monomer 6- O -vinyladipoyl- d -glucose (OVAG). The monomers of chlorphenesin were homopolymerized successfully. The obtained polymeric prodrugs were characterized with IR, NMR and GPC. The poly-OVSC and poly-OVAC have M n of 1.35 \u00d7 10 4 and 2.37 \u00d7 10 4 , and M w / M n of 1.95 and 4.30, respectively. Furthermore, the copolymers of chlorphenesin vinyl esters and glucose vinyl ester were also prepared successfully. The loadup of chlorphenesin in the two polymeric prodrugs was\u00a026.2 wt% (poly(OVSC- co -OVAG)), and 25.2 wt% (poly(OVAC- co -OVAG)). The investigation on the controlled release of the above-mentioned polymeric drugs and the preparation of chlorphenesin copolymers containing other biocompatible comonomers are in process.

The influence of parameters including enzyme, solvents and chain length of acyl donor on the reaction was investigated in detail. Lipase AY30 in diisopropyl ether demonstrated high selectivity towards the amino group of propranolol, while lipase M from Mucor javanicus in dioxane acylated selectively the hydroxyl group of propranolol. N -Acylpropranolol ( 3a \u2013 3c ) and O -acylpropranolol vinyl ( 4a \u2013 4c ) derivatives were obtained successfully, and can be used for preparing functional macromolecular prodrugs of beta-blockers drugs. N -(Vinyladipoyl)propranolol (NVAP) was copolymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA) using AIBN as initiator. The obtained polymeric prodrug was characterized with IR, NMR and GPC.

The products were characterized by ESI-MS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, and DSC. The results indicated the products to be monosubstituted esters, with monoacylation occurring at the C-2 secondary hydroxyl groups of beta-CD. The regioselectivity of the monoacylation as catalyzed by alkaline protease was not affected by the chain length of the acyl donor.",

For enzymatic polymerization of amino acids using protease in aqueous environment as the catalysis system, one main restriction is oligomer formation, usually along with other displayed advantages. Herein we developed an efficient solvent-free lipase-catalyzed polymerization of diethyl d- or l-aspartate, providing chiral d- and l-polyaspartates with an average degree of polymerization (DPavg) up to 60 and having about 96% \u03b2-linkages. Additionally, their distinct chemical and physical properties were characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), microscopic observation, and thermal analysis. Poly(\u03b2-d-AspEt) and Poly(\u03b2-l-AspEt) showed vertically mirrored negative and positive CD signals, high crystallinity, and entirely different microscopic morphology. They are thermal stable while having different decomposition (Td), melting (Tm), and cold crystallization temperatures (Tcc), respectively. Our results also showed that the complexation of enantiopure d- and l-polyaspartates was not stereocomplex but homocomplex.",

A serial of N-substituted imidazole derivatives were successfully synthesized in moderate yields by the catalysis of hydrolases in organic medium. Nine commercially available hydrolases from different sources were screened and all of them were found to be able to catalyze this type of addition reaction. The reaction yields depended on the solvent properties and the solvents with higher log P value supported this enzyme-catalyzed reaction to give higher conversion. Influence of the structure of the Michael acceptor and donor on the enzymatic Michael addition was also investigated. The acceptor with shorter alcohol chain afforded a higher yield. A more rapid conversion was observed when the donor had an electron-withdrawing group. This hydrolase-catalyzed Michael addition reaction has widened the applicability of biocatalysts in organic and bioorganic synthesis.",

        "title": "Promiscuous acylase-catalyzed aza-Michael additions of aromatic N-heterocycles in organic solvent",
        "abstract": "An efficient protocol for aza-Michael addition of aromatic N-heterocycles to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated compounds has been described. The reaction was catalyzed by promiscuous zinc-active-site acylase in organic solvent at 50 \u00b0C and most of the procedures could provide products in good yields in several hours (0.5\u20136 h). Abstract A novel and efficient enzymatic promiscuous protocol for aza-Michael addition of aromatic N-heterocycles to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated compounds has been described. The reactions were catalyzed by promiscuous zinc-active-site acylase in organic solvent at 50 \u00b0C. The strategy works with a broad range of N-heterocycles to afford the corresponding Michael adduct with good yields in several hours (0.5\u20136 h). This catalytic promiscuity is the first example of metal-active-site enzyme-catalyzed aza-Michael addition for aromatic N-heterocycles. The synthesis of biologically interesting compounds is an area of growing interest in organic and in some of bio-organic chemistry. N-Substituted aromatic N-heterocyclic compounds, such as imidazoles, triazoles, pyrazoles, pyrimidines and their derivatives obtained through aza-Michael addition are pharmacologically active and may be applied as potential therapeutic alternatives. 1 In general, the aza-Michael addition requires basic conditions or acidic catalysts that may lead to environmentally hazardous residues or undesirable side-products. 2 To avoid typical disadvantages resulting from the presence of such catalysts, a great number of alternatives have been studied in the past few years, such as CeCl 3 , 3a InCl 3 , 3b Yb(OTf) 3 , 3c Bi(OTf) 3 , 3d Cu(OTf) 2 , 3e LiClO 4 , 3f \u03b2-cyclodextrin, 3g polyethylene glycol, 3h heterogeneous solid acids, 3i ionic liquids, 3j\u2013l and water. 3m Recently, several serine-active-site hydrolases were found to be able to catalyze aza-Michael additions. Wild-type 4a and the Ser105Ala mutant of CAL-B 4b could catalyze the Michael-type addition of thiol and amine nucleophiles to a range of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Unfortunately, these works were focused on the enzymatic Michael addition of aliphatic amines and the related reports about aromatic N-heterocycles were rare. In our previous work, we examined the aza-Michael addition of aromatic N-heterocycles catalyzed by serine-active-site hydrolases 5 and found the reaction usually requires one or more days. In this Letter, we surveyed the aza-Michael additions of zinc-active-site acylases and surprisingly found that two zinc-active-site acylase, d -aminoacylase \u2018Amano\u2019 from Escherichia coli (DA) and acylase \u2018Amano\u2019 from Aspergillus oryzae (AA), could catalyze the reaction of aromatic N-heterocycles in several hours. This catalytic promiscuity is the first example about metal-active-site enzyme-catalyzed aza-Michael addition for aromatic N-heterocycles. Under the optimal conditions, Michael derivatives of diversified pentacyclic N-heterocycles and pyrimidines were successfully obtained under mild conditions. Acylase-catalyzed Michael addition of imidazole and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in organic medium has been achieved and it is shown in Scheme 1 . Eighteen derivatives of aromatic N-heterocycles have been obtained in moderate to high yields. The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . The Michael addition of 4-nitro-imidazole ( 1a ) and methyl acrylate ( 2a ) was first examined. When 0.2 mmol 1a and 2 equiv of 2a were added to 2 ml DMSO containing 10 mg DA, a single product was prepared in 95% isolated yield at 50 \u00b0C after 24 h. A similar result was observed for AA. The structure of the additional compounds was confirmed by IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and ESI-MS. We also monitored the formation of the product by HPLC and it is worthwhile to mention that no byproduct was detected resulting from acylation reaction, hydrolytic reaction or other reactions. We designed some control experiments to demonstrate the catalytic specificity of DA and AA. The reaction yields and the initial reaction rates were compared, which are summarized in Table 1 . From this study, the addition without any catalyst led to a very low yield (<0.5%) even after 24 h. In contrast, more than 95% yield was obtained in the presence of 10 mg DA or AA. The initial reaction rates of these cases were up to 333-fold and 638-fold faster than the process in absence of a biocatalyst, respectively. The initial rate is practically proportional to the enzyme amount. When the enzyme (AA) is pre-treated with urea at 100 \u00b0C in order to completely denaturalize the protein, the rate is practically equal to the bovine serum albumin (BSA), suggesting that the tertiary structure of the biocatalyst is necessary to catalyze the reaction. Then control reactions were run with inhibited DA and AA by adding 50 mM non-competitive inhibitor ZnCl 2 . 6 The inhibited enzyme did not show any acylase activity to catalyze the hydrolysis of N -acetyl- d -methionine, and the specific activity for the Michael addition was as that of BSA protein. All these results suggest that the tertiary structure and the specific active sites of zinc-acylase are responsible for the Michael addition reaction. Comparing with serine-active-site hydrolyses such as Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B), alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis (PA) and Amano Lipase M from Mucor javanicus (MJL), zinc-active-site acylase could catalyze the reaction more efficiently. Among the two acylase, AA could catalyze the enzymatic Michael addition more efficiently. Thus AA was selected for the next steps. Reaction media is an important factor in the enzymatic reaction. We examined the enzymatic Michael addition in different organic solvents with log P value ranging from \u22121.3 to 4.9 and the results are shown in Table 2 . The log P value of the solvents is the widely used parameter to describe solvent polarity and their possible effects on the enzyme activity, where P is the partition coefficient of a given solvent between water and n -octanol in a two-phase system. 7 It was found that the reaction only took place in DMSO and DMF. No obvious reaction was detected in other solvents. This may be attributed to the low solubility of 4-nitro-imidazole. In order to exclude the influence, we examined the Michael addition of imidazoles ( 1b ) and 2a . The results are also shown in Table 2 . Similar results were observed in DMF and DMSO. In other solvents, the Michael adducts could also be obtained in moderate to high yield. To our surprise, those solvents with a higher log P value exhibited higher conversion. The reaction proceeded smoothly and good yield was obtained in non-polar solvents such as n -hexane. Based on the good yield and substrate solubility, DMSO was selected in the following reactions. The scope of this method was investigated with a variety of structurally diverse imidazoles and \u03b1,\u03b2-carbonyl compound under Michael additions to generate the corresponding derivatives in moderate to good yields. The results are summarized in Table 3 . The reactivity decreased with increasing chain length of the acceptor, the longer chain the acrylates had, the lower the yield was obtained. Apart from acrylate ester, acrylonitrile could also react with imidazoles in good yields. Vinyl acrylate and butenone showed higher reactivity than methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate. In order to extend the scope of this method, \u03b1,\u03b2-substituted Michael acceptors like methyl \u03b1-methylacrylate and methyl crotonate were tested under the same conditions. Both of the acceptors showed rather lower activity because of the strong steric hindrance. To our disappointment, no enantioselectivity could be observed for the above tested reactions with the catalysis of DA or AA. The reason for this will be further investigated. Comparable behavior was observed using imidazole as substrate. The four substituted imidazoles examined underwent Michael addition with methyl acrylate favorably and all substituted imidazoles could be obtained from moderate to good yields. The reactivity decreased by the following order: 4-nitro-imidazole, imidazole, and 4-methyl-imidazole. The reactivity was in accordance with the nucleophilicity of imidazole derivatives. Substituted imidazoles with strong steric hindrance, such as 2-methyl-4-nitro-imidazole, underwent Michael addition much more slowly . Having obtained favorable results with imidazoles, we then examined the addition of other N-heterocycles to methyl acrylate. Other five membered N-heterocycles such as pyrazole and triazole also exhibited good Michael addition activity. Triazole reacted faster due to its stronger nucleophilicity than pyrazole. More complicated N-heterocycles, such as pyrimidines, can also be used as a substrate to obtain the corresponding Michael adducts. All the substituted pyrimidines derivatives were obtained in high yield. Among the examined pyrimidines, fluorouracil, and bromouracil reacted faster than uracil and thymine. It is worthwhile to mention that only N -1 adducts were observed (monitored by 1 H NMR and HPLC). This result reveals that AA exhibited higher regioselectivity compared to the chemical transformation. In this study, a facile and an efficient biotransformation method to perform aza-Michael addition of aromatic N-heterocycles has been developed by utilizing two promiscuous zinc-active-site acylases as biocatalysts. The structural influence of the Michael donor and acceptor was systematically studied. This strategy has expanded the application of catalytic promiscuities in organic synthesis. The obtained N-heterocyclic derivatives may be potentially bioactive and could be used as pharmacological alternatives.

        "abstract": "AbstractHuman epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become a well-established target for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, a large number of in-frame deletion, insertion and duplication mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) domain have been observed to alter drug response to such a kinase target. Thus, a systematic investigation of the intermolecular interactions between the clinical small-molecule agents and various EGFR in-frame mutants would help to establish a complete picture of drug response to kinase mutations in lung cancer, and to design new EGFR inhibitors with high potency and selectivity to target drug-resistant mutants. Here, we describe a combined pipeline to explore the drug response of five representative EGFR inhibitors, including three FDA-approved agents (gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib) and two compounds under clinical development (AEE788 and TAK-285) to a number of clinically relevant EGFR in-frame mutations, aiming at a comprehensive understa...",

The nanotubes were synthesized by a poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)-mediated polyol method employing a replacement reaction with silver nanowires as templates, and were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Under the optimal conditions, the sensor exhibits good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of AA, and this enables the determination of AA in the 5\u00a0\u03bcM to 2\u00a0mM concentration range, with a detection limit at 2\u00a0\u03bcM (at an S/N of 3). The response time is 2\u00a0s. The sensor displays good reproducibility, selectivity, sensitivity, and long-term stability.",

The influence of solvents, enzymes, chain length of the acyl donors, the power of the ultrasound bath, and intermittent ultrasound on the enzymatic synthesis was investigated. Among the eight solvents selected, pyridine was the most appropriate with alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis whether under ultrasound or shaking. The acceleration effect of ultrasound with Novozym 435 and the alkaline protease from B. subtilis-catalyzed transesterification increased with the chain length of acyl donors, decreasing from C(10) to C(4). We also investigated the influence of the power (50, 100, and 120 W) of the ultrasound irradiation and the manner of operation (continuous ultrasound, 10 min ultrasound/20 min shaking without ultrasound) on the transesterification. The results showed that higher power and continual operational gave the better acceleration. Ultrasound did not change the character and selectivity of the enzyme in the transesterification.",

Alternate deposition of PGEDMC and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) was carried out on ACV microcrystals. It was revealed that the drug release rate decreases with the increase of coated layer number and a microcapsule-drying treatment would enhance the sustained release effect probably because of a multilayer shrink and tightness during the process. The complete release of ACV yielded a hollow PGEDMC/PSS multilayered network with favorable integrity and nano-thickness by TEM and SEM. The potential targetability of the system was proved in vitro by PNA lectin recognition. Lectin hardly adsorbed on the film where the outmost layer was a polyanion or a polycation without galactose component. Whilst the galactose-containing layer (PGEDMC) was the outmost layer, a significant lectin combination was observed. This technique could provide a promising way to encapsulate and deliver various target substances in biological and pharmaceutical applications.",

Thermal treatment was performed on the capsules and a dramatic thermal shrinkage up to 60% decrease of capsule diameter above 50 degrees C was observed. This thermal behavior was then used to manipulate drug loading capacity and release rate. Heating after drug loading could seal the capsule shell, enhancing the loading capacity and reducing the release rate significantly. Excellent affinity between galactose-binding lectin and heated galactose-containing microcapsules were observed, indicating a stable targeting potential even after high temperature elevating up to 90 degrees C.",

Homopolymers of the two drugs were also synthesized by the same method. And the polymers were characterized by FTIR, (1)H NMR, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Self-assembly of the multidrug copolymer was verified by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The morphology of nanoparticles formed from the copolymer was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), which indicated that the nanoparticles were regular spheres with a diameter of 133+/-28nm.

        "abstract": "The efficient enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin using anhydrous tert -pentanol as a novel media has been demonstrated for the first time. p -OH-Phenylglycine methyl ester (HPGM) was selected as the activated acyl donor due to its good solubility in organic solvents. The screening results of 21 organic solvents showed that solvents with either strong polarity or poor substrate solubility were unfavorable. Remarkable catalytic activity of the immobilized penicillin acylase (IPA) from Escherichia coli was retained in tert -pentanol, and high yield could be obtained. Effects of various parameters such as acyl donor, water content or cosolvents of tert -pentanol, substrate concentration, temperature, etc., on the enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin in tert -pentanol were investigated systematically. The best reaction medium, the optimal temperature, initial concentration of 6-APA and HPGM and concentration of enzyme were tert- pentanol, 15 \u00b0C, 100, 200 mM and 20 IU/mL, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the yield of amoxicillin was as high as 88% after a reaction time of 20 h. Keywords Amoxicillin Enzymatic synthesis Organic solvent Penicillin G acylase 1 Introduction Amoxicillin, a widely used semi-synthetic antibiotic, is currently produced industrially via a chemical coupling of a \u03b2-lactam nucleus and suitable acyl donors, which involves tedious steps and very low temperatures [1] . In spite of the high yield achieved, this process has been criticized due to the use of toxic and non-biodegradable solvents and the waste produced during the protection/deprotection of reactive groups. There is an increasing interest in enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, since enzymes display high selectivity, specificity and activity under mild reaction conditions. The enzymatic process, then, has been intensively studied in order to replace the chemical route [2] . Enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin is currently catalyzed by penicillin G acylase (usually immobilized ones) under either a kinetically controlled strategy. But reactions carried out in aqueous media usually result in low yield. Much effort has been done to improve the synthesis in aqueous solution [3\u20137] . Sheldon et al. reported that for amoxicillin synthesis higher yield (38%) was obtained in ice at \u221220 \u00b0C than that obtained at 20 \u00b0C (10% only). However, a much longer reaction time was required to reach the maximum yield (6 days and 40 min, respectively) [8] . In situ product removal was also introduced into amoxicillin synthesis. Ulijn et al. reported that synthetic yield could be increased at least 30-fold in thermodynamic controlled reactions with 0.1 M ZnSO 4 present. However, the overall yield was still low and the presence of ZnSO 4 will result in products degradation at high ZnSO 4 concentration [9] . Low yield obtained in aqueous media was mainly attributed to the hydrolysis side reactions. Yield should increase at reduced water activity by depressing the competing hydrolytic reactions in favor of synthesis [10] . Therefore, organic cosolvents were then introduced into the reaction media as cosolvent to overcome these difficulties. Kim et al. studied the effect of methanol on the synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Higher yield was obtained and the further studies indicated that the solvent effect on reaction rate was mainly attributed to the kinetic effects of changes in p Ka values [11] . Chow et al. also reported that an improved ratio of synthesis to hydrolysis (S/H ratio) was obtained in the presence of methanol [12] . However, this additive also produced enzyme inhibition and deactivation. Park et al. reported that ethyl acetate and carbon tetrachloride could markedly improve the yield of cefazolin in the two-phase system due to the reduction of the hydrolysis of acyl donor and product [13] . Wei and Yang found that ethylene glycol was a favorable cosolvent in the synthesis of ampicillin [14] . Biphasic systems were also employed to improve the synthesis by extracting the product from the enzyme environment. Terreni et al. reported that polyethylene glycol (PEG 600)-ammonium sulphate aqueous two-phase systems provided a continuous extraction of the acylation product outside of the ammonium sulphate phase. This strategy shifted the equilibrium in the thermodynamically controlled synthesis and prevented the hydrolysis of the synthesized antibiotic in the kinetically controlled synthesis [15] . Other method for the synthesis was using enzymes with better properties. The use of penicillin V acylase from Streptomyces mobaraensis [16] and immobilized acylase from Arthrobacter viscosus [17] has been reported and better reaction outcomes than the PGA from Escherichia coli were obtained. However, reactions carried out in fully organic media received little attention. Some strong polar organic solvents are recognized to deprive the water on enzyme surface, while in the cases of weak to moderate polarity solvents, the substrates, both acyl acceptor and donor (usually a hydrochloride) show undesirable low solubility [18,19] . In fact, it is misleading that anhydrous organic solvents are inappropriate media for enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic. The overall performance of the synthesis in organic media is influenced by two factors: (i) the inhibitory effect of the solvent on the enzyme and (ii) the desirable increase in the non-ionized form of the substrate in the presence of solvent [20] . Enzyme activity will be well preserved with satisfying substrate solubility by careful design of organic solvent. Therefore, product hydrolysis can be depressed in fully organic media obviously, and high synthesis yield can be expected. In this paper, anhydrous organic solvents were tested for amoxicillin enzymatic synthesis. Substrate solubility and enzyme stability in these media have been investigated. Among the solvents chosen, tert -pentanol was superior. In our further studies, reaction time, mole ratio of p -OH-phenylglycine methyl ester (HPGM) to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), temperature and enzyme load for synthesis in tert- pentanol were investigated and good synthesis yield was obtained. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Immobilized penicillin acylase (IPA) from E. coli was a commercial product (polymethylacryloyl amide as the carrier) from Hunan Flag Biotech Co. Ltd., with declared activity of 108 U/g. 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) was from North China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation and p -OH-phenylglycine was from Zhejiang Apeloa Pharma Co. Ltd. tert -Pentanol was analytical grade from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Other solvents were all analytical grade. Thionyl chloride was added drop by drop to the mixture of p -OH-phenylglycine and methanol under continuous stirring in ice bath to form p -OH-phenylglycine methyl ester hydrochloride (HPGM\u00b7HCl) [21] . HPGM\u00b7HCl was then dissolved in water and 4 M NaOH solution was added to form the precipitation of HPGM. 2.2 Enzymatic reactions 2.2.1 Enzyme stability assays Stability of IPA was determined by measuring residual activity after incubating IPA for 12 h at 25 \u00b0C in an anhydrous organic solvent without substrates. After removing the organic solvents, enzymes were added to a solution containing 5% penicillin G (w/w in phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) and the hydrolysis was carried out at 25 \u00b0C and 200 rpm for 10 min. The rate of penicillin G hydrolysis in buffer solution was measured to determine the residual enzyme activity. 2.2.2 Synthesis of amoxicillin Enzymatic reactions of amoxicillin were carried out at 25 \u00b0C in vials shaken at 200 rpm in a temperature-controlled shaker. In the standard experiments, the reaction mixture was composed of 100 mM 6-APA, 100 mM acyl donors and 25 mM phosphate buffer of pH 6.8. The reactions were started by adding 10 IU/mL immobilized penicillin G acylase to the reaction mixture. In the case of anhydrous ones, organic solvents were used as media instead of phosphate buffer. Reaction time was 4 and 24 h, respectively. For HPLC analysis, the reaction mixture was added to 49-fold of water to ensure that the substrates and products were completely dissolved. 2.2.3 Analysis Substrates and products were identified and analyzed by HPLC using a Shimadzu SPD-10Avp equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-10Avp UV\u2013vis detector and a reversed-phase Agilent Zorbax SB C18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm). Samples were eluted with a sonicated mixture of 90% (v/v) 50-mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer pH 4.7 and 10% (v/v) methanol at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and analyzed in the UV detector at 230 nm. Elution times were 1.5, 2.6, 3.2 and 4.2 min for HPG, 6-APA, AMOX and HPGM, respectively. Concentration of substrates and products were calculated from calibration curves using stock solutions. HPLC samples were always assayed in triplicate, differences among them never exceeding 3%. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of acyl donor on the synthesis of amoxicillin p -OH-Phenylglycine methyl ester hydrochloride (HPGM\u00b7HCl) and p -OH-phenylglycine methyl ester (HPGM) were used as acyl donor in amoxicillin enzymatic synthesis in organic solvents, respectively. Solvents with different polarity were chosen, including tert- pentanol, tert- butanol, ethyl ether, acetone, methanol, DMF and DMSO. No synthesis was observed in reactions where HPGM\u00b7HCl was used, while product was detected in reactions using HPGM. Similar results were obtained in the cases of phosphate buffer solution under the same reaction conditions, higher yield of 30% with HPGM than that of 18% with HPGM\u00b7HCl was achieved. This may be attributed to the undesirable low substrate solubility of the charged acyl donor. HPGM was then considered to be more favorable than HPGM\u00b7HCl, for enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin in fully organic media. Thus, HPGM was used as acyl donor in all the following experiments. 3.2 Enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin in fully organic media Enzymatic synthesis was carried out in several common organic media, considering solvent polarity and enzyme stability as variable. Initial concentration of both acyl donor and 6-APA was 100 mM, 10 IU IPA was added and reaction time was 24 h. Quite different results were obtained which are shown in Table 1 . The enzyme was inactivated after 12 h incubating in solvents with strong polarity. Thus, no product was detected in DMSO and DMF, although both 6-APA and HPGM dissolved in them very well. Except THF and pyridine, most of the solvents with moderate polarity possessed high residual activity of IPA. In THF and pyridine, IPA showed quite low residual activity and synthetic yield, this may be attributed to the ring structure of the solvents [22] . In these solvents with moderate polarity, tert- pentanol was the most suitable one for the enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin and 48% yield could be obtained. Although enzyme activity could be well preserved in solvents with weak polarity such as chloroform and benzene, the reaction almost could not be detected, which was caused possibly by the poor solubility of the substrates in such solvents. Reactions in organic media took longer time to achieve the maximum yield, compared with those in aqueous media (4\u20135 h usually). This indicates that IPA shows less activity in organic media. However, hydrolysis of both HPGM and amoxicillin was impressive due to the low water activity of the reaction system [13] , thus higher synthesis yield was obtained. 3.2.1 Enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin in alcohols Results above indicated that alcohols could be favorable media for amoxicillin enzymatic synthesis. Thus, a series of alcohols were tested in order to find the most appropriate one. Reactions were carried out at 25 \u00b0C in vials shaken at 200 rpm. Initial concentration of both acyl donor and 6-APA was 100 mM and 10 IU IPA was added. Reaction time was 20 h. Results are shown in Table 2 . Strong polarity alcohols such as methanol and ethanol showed strong inhibition of the enzyme activity and led to very low synthetic yield. For reactions in monohydric alcohol with moderate polarity, the synthetic yield increased with the decrease of alcohol polarity. However, alcohols with weak polarity such as octanol, provided satisfying residual enzyme activity but low synthetic yield, which may be mainly attributed to the poor substrate solubility. Polyhydric alcohols such as 1,4-butanediol and glycerol could well keep the enzyme activity but surprisingly lead to low yields. Moreover, polyhydric alcohols were found to be substrates of the enzyme and new esters were detected. But no new esters were detected in the case of monohydric alcohols. Among the alcohols chosen, tert -pentanol provides the best result. 3.2.2 Effect of water content in tert-pentanol on the synthesis of amoxicillin Effect of water content in tert- pentanol was studied to determine the optimal water concentration for this reaction. Synthesis was carried out in water/ tert- pentanol mixture, considering water concentration (v/v) as variable and product yield as evaluation parameter. When water concentration was above 80%, where these two solvents form a single-phase mixture, synthetic yield decreased rapidly with the increase of tert- pentanol concentration ( Fig. 1 ). This may be mainly due to the inhibition of the synthesis activity of the enzyme at the presence of organic solvent. Direct hydrolysis of HPGM dominated the entire process [23] and only low synthesis yield was achieved. While the further increase of tert- pentanol concentration would improve the synthesis yield gradually. This may be attributed to the reduction of water activity and the incidental suppression of hydrolysis [24] . This indicated the reduction of water in reaction media could improve the synthesis yield. Though tert -pentanol was subjected to a rigorous solvent drying, the IPA we used contained a lot of water. For the further reduction of water, IPA was subjected to lyophilization and used as catalyst for amoxicillin synthesis. No synthesis was detected in tert -pentanol. We firstly considered that the inefficiency of these reactions were mainly caused by the low solubility of 6-APA in anhydrous tert -pentanol. Therefore, piperidine, which showed satisfying solubility in tert -pentanol, was then chosen as an acyl receptor and reactions were carried out under the catalysis of IPA with or without lyophilization. Synthesis was observed in reactions catalyzed by IPA without lyophilization. Thus, it can be concluded that IPA subjected to lyophilization will lose activity and become inappropriate catalyst. 3.2.3 Effect of cosolvents on the reaction in anhydrous tert-pentanol Organic solvents in aqueous media often suppress the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction by lowering water activity and/or altering the p Ka values of substrates [13,22] , and higher yield or S/H ratio can be obtained. Therefore, herein, organic cosolvents were employed to the reactions in tert -pentanol on the hypothesis that organic cosolvents could modify the properties of reaction media, in order to obtain higher yields. Four solvents with different polarity such as DMSO, ethylene glycol, ethyl ether and toluene were chosen. The results are presented in Fig. 2 . All cosolvents chosen showed negative effect on reactions carried out in anhydrous tert -pentanol. Maximum yields of amoxicillin decreased in the presence of cosolvents, compared to those obtained in pure tert -pentanol. The extent of inhibition increased rapidly with the increase of both cosolvent concentration and cosolvent polarity. It is interesting to note that ethylene glycol provided very obvious negative effect on amoxicillin synthesis even at low concentration, which is quite different from the result obtained in aqueous solutions for ampicillin [14] . Therefore, anhydrous tert -pentanol without any cosolvents was considered as a favorable medium for the enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin. Then other factors including reaction time, mole ratio of HPGM to 6-APA, temperature and amount of enzyme used were further studied. 3.3 Effect of reaction time on amoxicillin synthesis in tert-pentanol The time course of the yield was studied to determine the optimal reaction time for amoxicillin synthesis, which is shown in Fig. 3 . During the first several hours, only a little amoxicillin had been synthesized. After 18 h reaction, yield obtained was close to the maximum ones and the optional reaction time would be 20 h. It needs much longer time to obtain the maximum yield, because of the slower reaction rate in organic media than that of aqueous ones. Long reaction time may lead to low productivity in industrial application. However, further studies such as a better dispersion of catalyst and substrates, further improvement on substrate concentration and improvement on enzyme activity, are good for achieving a shorter reaction time. 3.4 Effect of ratio of HPGM to 6-APA on amoxicillin synthesis in tert-pentanol When 6-APA concentration was fixed at 100 mM, synthesis of amoxicillin depended on the concentration of HPGM ( Fig. 4 ). Low yield was obtained at low HPGM concentration, which indicated that much faster HPGM hydrolysis than amoxicillin synthesis occurred in this situation. With the increase of HPGM concentration, amoxicillin synthesis dominated the process and higher yield was obtained. However, no significant improvement was obtained with the further increase of HPGM concentration. Therefore, the appropriate ratio is 1:2. 3.5 Effect of temperature on amoxicillin synthesis in tert-pentanol Reaction temperature plays an important role in enzymatic antibiotic synthesis [8,13] , producing opposite effects on enzyme activity and inactivation rate [25] . Low temperature was found to be beneficial to the synthesis [26,27] . It could be seen from Fig. 5 that the yield increased rapidly with the decrease of temperature. This may be mainly due to the decrease of the rate of product hydrolysis at low reaction temperature [28] . When reaction temperature was above 35 \u00b0C, 6-APA conversion became much larger than the amoxicillin yield, which indicated undesirable side reactions such as 6-APA degradation occurred. 3.6 Influence of immobilized enzyme load on amoxicillin synthesis in tert-pentanol Enzyme load shows a significant influence on synthesis yield ( Fig. 6 ). Only low synthesis yield was obtained when enzyme load was small. This may be mainly attributed to the inhibitory effect of organic solvent on the enzyme [20] . Improved synthesis yield was obtained when the enzyme load increased. However, when the amount of IPA is up to 25 IU/mL, the reaction mixture will become thick and the substrate dispersion became inefficient, and undesirable results come out. However, when a better dispersion of the substrates and IPA is achieved, significant improvement on product yield can be expected. 3.7 Optimal conditions for enzymatic synthesis of amoxicillin Studies above have shown that low temperature, tert -pentanol, low water content, proper substrate ratio and large amount of enzyme used would favor the synthesis of amoxicillin over hydrolysis. Then the optimal reaction conditions were obtained. Reaction was carried out in tert -pentanol at 15 \u00b0C, initial concentration of 6-APA and HPGM were 100 and 200 mM. 20 IU/mL IPA was added and reaction time was 20 h. Yield of product was up to 88%. 3.8 Repeated utilization of IPA Repeated utilization of IPA in tert- pentanol has been investigated. Reactions were carried out in tert- pentanol at 25 \u00b0C, initial concentration of 6-APA and HPGM were 100 and 200 mM, respectively. 20 IU/mL IPA was added and reaction time was 20 h. Results are shown in Fig. 7 . The reaction mixture was filtered after the reaction was completed. IPA was washed and then incubated in tert- pentanol for 30 min. Organic solvent was removed and IPA was used as the catalyst for the next batch of reaction. No significant enzyme activity loss was observed after five reaction cycles. This successfully demonstrated the feasibility of amoxicillin enzymatic synthesis in fully anhydrous tert- pentanol and provided an attractive protocol for enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in organic solvents. However, further studies are still required to improve the S/H ratio, or to further improve the yields and thus reduce the excess of acyl donor. A proper selection of a good enzyme and proper immobilization protocols are hopeful to solve this problem. Moreover, the enzyme showed the highest activity at pH 8\u20139 [29] , incubating IPA in buffer solution of pH 8 before the reaction may be beneficial to the synthesis. 4 Conclusion Kinetically controlled synthesis of amoxicillin with IPA in anhydrous organic solvents was investigated. More than 20 organic solvents were chosen in terms of solvent polarity and substrate solubility, considering yield as evaluation parameters. Alcohols were superior and, among them, tert -pentanol was the best. Factors of reaction were then studied, including reaction time, ratio of HPGM to 6-APA, temperature and amount of enzyme used. It was found that the enzymatic process was significantly influenced by factors above. The best result of 88% yield was obtained at 15 \u00b0C, 20 IU/mL IPA under 2/1 HPGM molar excess, after a reaction time of 20 h.

Keywords Penicillin acylase Ampicillin Enzymatic synthesis One-pot Penicillin G potassium 1 Introduction Ampicillin is one of the most widely used \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in therapy as it is suitable for a wide spectrum of bacterial infections and has a good level of activity and tolerability. Up to now, many evolutions have been acquired in the enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin and kinetically controlled strategy was demonstrated to be efficient [1\u20137] . Furthermore, many approaches also have been reported to improve the efficiency of the synthesis. In aqueous medium, the effect of the substrate concentration was investigated [4\u20139] . It has been shown that high reactant concentrations are favorable for synthesis. Synthesis of ampicillin and cephalexin in highly condensed systems in the absence of a liquid aqueous phase has also been studied [10] . Youshko and Svedas [11] reported that the space-time yield of solid-state enzymatic ampicillin synthesis was shown to be up to ten times higher compared to the homogeneous solutions and heterogeneous systems. Optimizations of pH [6,11\u201313] , ionic strength [12,13] and temperature [13\u201315] were also evolved to improve the efficiency of the acyl transfer to the \u03b2-lactam nucleus. Recently, a lot of efforts have been made in the enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in the presence of organic co-solvents [14,16\u201328] to enhance the performance of enzyme, among which ethylene glycol (EG) has been used most widely. Wei and Yang [21] found that EG was a favorable co-solvent in the synthesis of ampicillin. Synthesis of cephalexin and ampicillin in the presence of EG has been studied thoroughly by Illanes et al. [14,22\u201326] . Although enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in aqueous medium has acquired great results [9] , EG exhibits some advantages as the co-solvent in the synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. A related concept involving the use of enzymatic cascades that subject a starting compound to a number of consecutive reactions may be more efficient than the usual stepwise approach by saving the effort of isolating intermediates and avoiding the accumulation of reactive and unstable intermediates. One-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis of 3\u2032-functionalized cephalosporines (cefazolin) by three consecutive biotransformations in fully aqueous medium has been studied by Justiz et al. [29] . High yields were obtained through a careful selection of the enzyme catalyst, experimental conditions, and synthetic strategy. One-pot enzymatic synthesis of cephalexin has been established by Wegman et al. [30] . To our best knowledge, however, there is no report on the synthesis of ampicillin using one-pot method which attracted our interest. As we known, penicillin G acylase can not only synthesize ampicillin from 6-APA and D-PGM, but also convert penicillin G potassium salt into 6-APA by hydrolysis, which has been applied at the industrial scale widely. These considerations lead us to combine the hydrolysis of PGK into 6-APA with the kinetically controlled enzymatic coupling of 6-APA with D-PGM to give ampicillin as the final product by using a single enzyme (see Fig. 1 ). The novel strategy can not only save the effort of isolating 6-APA, but also efficiently reduce the industrial cost of ampicillin because of the lower price of PGK than that of 6-APA. Here, we report two-step, one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin catalyzed by IPA in aqueous buffer/organic co-solvent. After examining in detail the effects of the reaction parameters including co-solvent content, reaction time, ratio of D-PGM to PGK, temperature and enzyme loading, on the outcome of the procedure, 57.3% yield were achieved. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Immobilized penicillin acylase (IPA-750) from Escherichia coli was purchased from Hunan Flag Bio-technology Co. Ltd. (China). By measuring the initial rate of penicillin G hydrolysis (5%, w/v, pH 8 and 25 \u00b0C), with declared activity was 108 IU/g. d -Phenylglycine (D-PG) was kindly donated by Zhejiang Apeloa Pharma Co. Ltd (China). PGK was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (Japan). EG was analytical grade from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). D-PGM\u00b7HCl was prepared according to our previous report [31] . All other reagents were analytical grade. 2.2 Synthesis of ampicillin The two-step, one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin was carried out in vials agitated at 200 rpm in a temperature-controlled incubator shaker, using PGK and D-PGM as substrates, sodium phosphate buffer and EG as solvent. The reaction was started by adding appropriate amount of enzyme to the reaction mixture (1 ml solvent with substrates). When the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was added to 49-fold water to ensure that substrates and products were completely dissolved. The solution was subjected to HPLC analysis. 2.3 Analysis Substrates and products were identified and analyzed by HPLC using a Shimadzu SPD-10Avp equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-10Avp UV\u2013vis detector and a reversed-phase C 18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm). The eluent was composed of 70% (v/v) sodium phosphate buffer (20 mmol dm \u22123 , pH 6.0), 30% (v/v) methanol. The pH of the eluent solution was adjusted with phosphoric acid. The flow rate of the eluent was 1.0 ml min \u22121 and the solutes were detected by the UV detector at 214 nm. Elution times were 3.0, 3.2, 6.0 and 7.0 min for D-PG, 6-APA, ampicillin and D-PGM, respectively. Concentration of substrates and products were calculated from calibration curves using stock solutions. The yield of ampicillin was determined based on the initial concentration of PGK and expressed as a percentage. Every sample of the reactions was performed repeatedly for 3 times and the relative error was less than 5%. 2.4 Operational stability of biocatalysts The operational stability of the biocatalysts was determined by measuring the residual activity of hydrolysis at the end of one batch. After washing enzymes with phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 5 times and removing solvent, enzymes were added to a solution containing 5% penicillin G (w/w in phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) and the hydrolysis was carried out at 25 \u00b0C and 200 rpm for 10 min. The rate of penicillin G hydrolysis in buffer solution was measured to determine the residual enzyme activity. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of EG on the synthesis of ampicillin For enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics under kinetic control, the yield of product may increase in the presence of EG [14,21\u201326] . Both Illanes and Fajardo [22,23,25] and Wei and Yang [21] reported that EG inhibited the hydrolysis of both the ampicillin and D-PGM, so the synthesis yield of the ampicillin could be improved. Illanes et al. [14,24\u201326] also achieved great success in the synthesis of cephalexin in the presence of EG. So we tried to synthesize ampicillin in one-pot in aqueous buffer/EG co-solvent. The effect of solvent content on the one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin has been studied. As shown in Fig. 2 , the yield of ampicillin varied from 19.3% (in the absence of co-solvent) to 38.6% at 50% (v/v) co-solvent concentration, then the yield decreased with the further increase of EG content. This may be attributed to the following reasons: 1. The hydrolysis of PGK was inhibited at low water concentration. 2. Enzyme activity was also inhibited at high organic solvent concentration. Thus, 50% (v/v) EG in the reaction mixture was selected as the optimal co-solvent concentration in the following experiments. 3.2 Influence of immobilized enzyme loading on the synthesis of ampicillin As shown in Fig. 3 , the concentration of the IPA-750 has a substantial influence on the one pot synthesis of ampicillin. Increased enzyme loading from 32.4 UI/ml to 43.2 UI/ml leads to the increased yield of ampicillin by more than 50%. However further increase of IPA-750 concentration at the same reaction conditions surprisingly results in a suppressed ampicillin synthesis: with enzyme loading 64.8 IU/ml yield falls down nearly to the level observed with 32.4 UI/ml. According to our observation, 43.2 IU IPA-750/ml was regarded as an appropriate initial concentration for the one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin in 50% (v/v) EG, with the yield of 42.0 %. 3.3 Effect of pH on the synthesis of ampicillin The hydrolysis of PGK could be affected by the pH. Thus, sodium phosphate buffers of different pH were investigated for the reaction. As reported [30] , at pH 8.0, the initial rate of PGK hydrolysis was improved. This observation led us to consider the influence of pH on the one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin. The time course of such reactions is shown in Fig. 4 , unexpectedly, the pH had few effects on the reaction time when the maximal yield was achieved. However, the yield of ampicillin was increased while pH varied from 6.0 to 8.0. The effects of pH on the one-pot synthesis of ampicillin were performed as the same results of former researches: yield decreased at low pH, which has been predicted for the kinetically controlled synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in aqueous medium [32] and has been proven experimentally for the synthesis of ampicillin in the presence of co-solvents [22] . As a result, the reaction reached the maximal yield in 52.8% at 17 h when the pH was 8.0. 3.4 Effect of temperature on the synthesis of ampicillin Temperature is a key variable for the enzymatic synthesis. Low temperature is usually more beneficial to enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in aqueous medium [25] . The time courses of the one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin at different temperatures were shown in Fig. 5 . At 15 \u00b0C, the synthesis rate was very low. Thus, it took a long reaction time of 28 h to approach the maximum yield. Then, the yield of the ampicillin decreased because the product was hydrolyzed by the enzyme. However, it took much less time (12 h) to reach the equilibrium at 35 \u00b0C, because the activity of the enzyme was improved at higher temperature, while lower yield was obtained due to the enhanced hydrolysis of ampicillin and D-PGM. Compared with those data at 15 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C, the maximal yield was gained at 25 \u00b0C after 17 h. Therefore, 25 \u00b0C was considered as the optimum temperature for the reaction with the yield of 52.8%. 3.5 Molar ratio of D-PGM/PGK at different initial substrate concentration Using excess D-PGM is a drawback in the kinetically controlled synthesis of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. However, it has proven to be necessary to attain high yield, mainly because penicillin acylase can also hydrolyze D-PGM to the side product D-PG [26] as an esterase. Therefore, the molar ratio of D-PGM to PGK at different concentrations of PGK was investigated. As shown in Table 1 , low yields were obtained at 50 mM PGK with different ratios of D-PGM to PGK. When the initial concentration of PGK was 100 mM, the yield increased from 20.9% to 57.3% when the molar ratio of D-PGM to PGK changed from 1/1 to 1/3. However, there was no evident increase in the yield as the ratio varied from 1/3 to 1/4. It showed that 3 multiple D-PGM was enough for the reaction. The similar results could be observed under the 150 mM initial concentration of PGK. But compared with the former, the yields of ampicillin were brought down possibly because of the lack of enzyme. In conclusion, 100 mM PGK and 300 mM D-PGM was considered as the optimum substrate concentration for the reaction with the yield of 57.3%. 3.6 Optimal conditions for two-step, one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin According to the above results, the optimal reaction conditions were obtained. The two-step, one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin was carried out in the reaction media being composed of 50% EG and 50% phosphate buffer with pH 8.0 at 25 \u00b0C, the initial concentration of PGK and D-PGM were 100 mM and 300 mM, respectively. 43.2 IU/ml IPA-750 was added and reaction time was 17 h. Yield of product was up to 57.3%. 3.7 Repeated utilization of IPA Repeated utilization of IPA-750 for one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin in buffer\u2013EG mixture has been investigated. The reaction mixture was filtered after the reaction was completed. IPA-750 was washed with buffer\u2013EG mixture for 5 times. After solvent was removed, IPA was reused as the catalyst for the next batch of reaction. Reactions were carried out in buffer\u2013EG mixture at 25 \u00b0C, initial concentration of PGK and D-PGM were 100 mM and 300 mM respectively. 43.2 IU/ml IPA-750 was added and reaction time was 17 h. As seen from Fig. 6 , no mechanical losses were produced since the reaction was conducted in a closed system with full retention of the biocatalyst particles in 6 batches. The result successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the one-pot two-step enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin and provided an attractive protocol for enzymatic synthesis of penicillins from penicillin G salts. 4 Conclusions A two-step, one-pot enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin in phosphate buffer\u2013EG system has been demonstrated for the first time. d -Phenylglycine methyl ester (D-PGM) and penicillin G potassium salt (PGK) were used as the substrates. EG were employed to improve the synthesis yield. Reaction parameter, including co-solvent content, reaction time, ratio of PGM to PGK, temperature and enzyme loading were studied to evaluate their effect on the reaction. The best result of 57.3% yield was obtained at 25 \u00b0C, 43.2 IU/ml IPA-750 under 3/1 D-PGM molar excess, after a reaction time of 20 h. The novel strategy can not only save the effort of isolating 6-APA, but also efficiently reduce the industrial cost of ampicillin because of the lower price of PGK than that of 6-APA, which showed a great potential in industry. Further studies about the yields, isolating the product and reducing the excess of acyl donor are being conducted in our laboratory.

A series of organic solvents with different polarity were screened and ethyl acetate was found to be the most satisfying solvent for the enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin. Remarkable catalytic activity of the IPA was retained in ethyl acetate, and high yield could be obtained. Furthermore, some significant factors that greatly affect the ampicillin synthesis process, such as substrate concentration, temperature and water content of IPA etc., were investigated in details. As a result, high yield (92.9%) and synthesis/hydrolysis (S/H) ratio (1.50) were successfully achieved under the optimum conditions.",

Transesterification reactions of metronidazole with fatty acid vinyl esters (from vinyl caprylate to vinyl stearate) and divinyl dicarboxylate (from divinyl butanedioate to divinyl decanedioate) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran were catalyzed by Candida antarctica lipase acrylic resin and provided a series of lipophilic metronidazole ester. Subsequently, under the catalysis of alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis , acylation of d -glucose and d -mannose with metronidazole vinyl ester was carried out in pyridine. Hydrophilic metronidazole-saccharide derivatives were regioselectivly synthesized. Reaction conditions including enzyme sources and solvents for the esterification of metronidazole were examined in detail. The result of enzyme screening showed that C. antarctica lipase acrylic resin in tetrahydrofuran exhibited the highest catalytic activity and the conversion ratio of metronidazole after 24 h was up to 97.4%. Polarity and substrate solubility of reaction solvents have great influence on the enzymatic transesterification. Polar solvents in which metronidazole has high solubility are favorable.",

Here, we report a one-pot cascade combining photocatalysts with (R)- or (S)-selective ketoreductases for the decarboxylative carbonylation of carboxylic acids and the subsequent bioreduction to generate valuable chiral alcohols. Using this approach, various chiral alcohols with complementary (R)- or (S)-configurations were prepared with good yields (up to 93%) and excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee). Such a photochemo-enzymatic one-pot whole-cell process combines the advantages of both photocatalysts and enzyme catalysts and provides a mild, green, metal-free and highly stereoselective alternative in asymmetric decarboxylative hydroxylation reactions.",

The effects of the concentration of isopropanol in the mobile phase were studied, seven of the eight enantiomers got baseline separation on Chiralcel OD-H, and five of the eight enantiomers got successfully separation on Chiralcel OJ-H.

        "abstract": "A Dove prism and an anamorphic prism pair are investigated in negative index imaging systems. An equilateral triangular prism with refractive index of -1 operates as a negative index Dove prism that inverts as well as images the incident field. A negative index anamorphic prism pair acts as a negative index imaging system with magnification. The relationship between achievable magnification and aberrations is discussed. Both prism systems can be implemented by using negative index photonic crystals, and their performance is demonstrated numerically by the finite-difference time-domain method. These negative index prism structures enhance the functionalities of negative index flat lenses and broaden the applications of negative index materials.",

The reflection can be described by either the odd symmetry of the Bloch wave or a tangential momentum matching condition. In addition, the Bloch wave propagates through the photonic crystal in a negative refraction regime, which manages diffraction within the prism. A device with three input channels has been fabricated and tested that illuminates different regions of the reflection interface. The reflected wave is then sampled by a photonic wire array, where the individual channels are resolved. Heterodyne near field scanning optical microscopy is used to characterize the spatial phase variation of the evanescent wave and its decay constant.",

Extensive numerical modeling studies were conducted to find the optimal nanocluster dimensions. Self-assembly of silver nanoparticles coated with nanoscale silica coating was then performed on polymer templates fabricated by laser interference lithography. The nanoclusters supported magnetic resonance in the visible region, and the extracted effective permeability exhibited Lorentz-like resonance. The experimentally observed lowest value for the real part of permeability was 0.06. The nanocluster metamaterial represents a practical metamaterial architecture that is compatible with the scalable bottom-up manufacturing process.",

The graded negative index lens is capable of focusing plane waves and can also be made highly insensitive to frequency, enabling broadband negative index imaging. We provide a simple model for the graded PC lens and predict its superior focusing properties such as low chromatic aberrations and broadband operation. Those properties were also confirmed and analyzed by the finite-difference time-domain simulations. We believe the negative index graded PCs will expand the utility of PC lenses and enable new applications in optoelectronic systems.",

        "abstract": "The two-dimensional concentration distribution was reconstructed by using algebraic iterative reconstruction algorithm. This paper mainly focused on the effects of multispectral H2O absorptions on condition that the laser beam was less and the temperature was known, i.e. the influence of temperature on spectral line-strength was not considered as to this concentration distribution. Based on ART algorithm, increased spectral lines and increased laser beam were compared under the same concentration model. Three H2O lines were selected to reconstruct two-dimensional distribution of non-uniform gas concentration, and these three transitions were selected within the external cavity diode laser turning range in the simulated system. The interested region was discretized to 10\u00d710 grid points, and the temperature and concentration of the reconstruction model were not evenly distributed, so the unimodal distribution and bimodal distribution were used to describe the concentration distribution. The simulated system also calculated the effective utilization of laser beams and absorption lines. The results showed that the reconstruction quality quickly increased with increasing H2O absorption lines when the laser beams were very few, the increased absorption lines could get more spectral information related to the concentration. The increased laser beam is also effective to improve the accuracy of reconstruction results, but increasing the absorption lines can better reconstruct a two-dimensional concentration distribution. Improving the absorption lines can also effectively reduce the costs of the hardware and the complexity of the measurement system, which shows that the multispectral absorption lines are applicable to in-situ measurements.",

Only one distributed feedback diode laser with a center wavelength at 1397.83 nm combined with a scanned-wavelength direct absorption spectroscopy technique was used during measurements. The attenuation of laser intensity caused by soot extinction and H2O gas absorption after transmitting through the flame region was detected and distinguished, respectively. Soot volume faction was inferred from the light extinction with Rayleigh limit assumption. The absorption signals of two H2O spectral lines were acquired during one scanning, thus both the H2O concentration and its temperature can be retrieved. Measurements have been taken in ethylene/air premixed flat flames on a standard bronze McKenna burner at different cold-gas velocities (5.9 cm/s and ...",

        "abstract": "Objective: To establish a lung metastasis mouse model of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and screen for lung metastasis CCRCC cell line, so as to lay a foundation for future study. Methods: RCC05-TXJ, a CCRCC cell line established by our lab, was used in the present study. The cells were proliferated and the cell suspension was subcutaneously injected into the NOD-SCID mice. The newly-formed tumors were transplanted into the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice (in situ), and the formed tumors were harvested and again transplanted into NOD-SCID mice. A stable mouse model with CCRCC lung metastasis was established following several cycles of the transplantation. This transplantation cycle was repeated until the development of stable lung metastasis. The lung metastasis tissues were then injected into renal capsule for several cycles to induce the lung metastasis. The metastasis tissues were also primary cultured and proliferated and the cell suspensions were injected into renal capsule until the development of lung metastasis. The sub-cell lines which could stably produce lung metastasis were screened. During the screening, the in situ tumor information, lymphatic and pulmonary metastasis were all recorded in detail. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to examine the expression of CA9 (a marker of renal cells) and CD133 (a marker of stem cells) on the metastatic CCRCC cells. Results: The lung metastasis was observed in the second cycle of the in situ transplantation of RCC05-TXJ in NOD-SCID mice. When the metastatic lung carcinoma tissues were used for in situ transplantation, lung metastasis was successfully established during the 3-6 cycles. CCRCC cells were successfully cultured with lung metastatic tissues, and the cell suspension of the passage 6 cells caused lung metastasis after implanted in the renal capsule. The result was stable in two repeated cycles. The lung metastatic RCC05-TXJ-L cells grew fast (average passage time was 2 days), and had a short in situ tumor-forming time (1 week). They also had a strong potential for lung metastasis and high expression of CA9 and CDI33. Conclusion: Repeated in situ transplantation of RCC05-TXJ can be used to establish stable lung metastasis mice model of CCRCC. The selected RCC05-TXJ-L sub-cell line can stably induce lung metastasis in NOD-SCID mice.",

Methods: Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique, we examined GSTM3 expression in surgical specimens of 24 primary ccRCCs and adjacent non-malignant tissues, 14 metastatic ccRCCs and 2 ccRCC cell lines (RCC05-TXJ,RCC05-ZTJ) with different metastatic potentials. RCC05-TXJ cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of GSTM3 in response to 5-Aza-CdR treatment. Nested bisulfite sequencing PCR and DNA sequencing were used to analyze different methylation locuses in GSTM3 gene promoter in 10 primary ccRCCs and adjacent non-malignant tissues. We also examined the methylation level in 10 primary ccRCCs and the corresponding non-malignant tissues as well as 8 metastatic tissues by nested methylation-specific PCR. Results: Expression of GSTM3 gene in metastatic ccRCC cells (RCC05-TXJ) was lower than that in the non-metastatic ccRCC cells (RCC05-ZYJ). Down-regulation of GSTM3 gene expression was found in 17 of the 24 primary ccRCCs as compared with the non-malignant tissue. Expression of GSTM3 in the metastatic ccRCCs was lower than that in primary ccRCCs. 5-Aza-CdR treatment increased GSTM3 expression in RCC05-ZYJ. Methylation in GSTM3 promoter was found in 4 of 10 ccRCC tissues, 2 of 10 adjacent tissues, and 1 of 8 metastatic tissues. No significant difference was found between ccRCC and adjacent tissues (P = 0.628) or ccRCC and metastatic disease (P = 0.314) due to limit number of cases. Conclusion: Our findings support that promoter aberrant methylation is one of the major mechanisms of GSTM3 gene down-regulation in ccRCC. The preliminary identification of GSTM3 promoter methylation sites may provide a basis for further study.",

A combination of NMSP and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was better than PSA alone in screen of PCa. Conclusion: CpG islands of promoter region of GSTP1 gene is hypermethylated in PCa tissues. NMSP is sensitive and specific in detection of GSTP1 methylation, which may serve as a new method for early screen of prostate carcinoma.",

However, CMA of aperture antennas is cumbersome as the equivalent magnetic current is rarely available in main stream method of moments solvers. Based on the duality principle, an equivalent CMA of aperture antennas is proposed, by which the characteristic values and characteristic magnetic currents are calculated through its complementary form. A rigorous proof for such equivalence is provided. Lumped loads are very useful for the manipulation of certain modes, and in this paper, the relationship between the loads for an aperture and its complementary plate is built. The duality CMA is applied to reduce the mutual coupling between aperture antennas etched on a finite plate. Interdigital capacitors are adopted to suppress the out-of-band mutual coupling while an H-shaped aperture for the reduction of in-band one for narrow slots. Numerical and experimental results show that over 10 dB reduction of mutual coupling is achieved for both examples.",

However, antenna mutual coupling in the near field is still an intractable problem. In this communication, CMA is adopted to analyze and mitigate the near-field coupling between antennas. It is found that more modes are required in CMA as the contributions of higher order modes are more significant in the near-field region. In addition, the modal near-field distributions are proposed to discriminate the unwanted modes along with the modal admittance and eigencurrent distributions. Inductive loads are used to suppress the unwanted modes for mitigating the out-of-band mutual coupling while the in-band radiation property is mostly retained. The design procedures are elaborated through a two-dipole-antenna system, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through fabricated prototypes. Based on the measured results, a significant reduction, more than 10 dB, of mutual coupling in the near field is obtained compared with those without optimization.",

A bowtie antenna, an aircraft and a spherical shell are selected for numerical verification. To improve the stability and accuracy of the interpolation algorithm, a sampling scheme integrating non-uniform frequency step (NUFS) into adaptive mode tracking is adopted. For comparison, the same problems are computed also by the method of moments (MoM) and a uniform frequency step (UFS) interpolation scheme. It is found that the interpolated eigenvalues and eigenpatterns by the NUFS scheme are very close to those by MoM while the ones by the UFS scheme yield larger deviations. The peak memory and computation time have been also studied. Compared with the computation by MoM, the memory consumed by the interpolation with NUFS is less and up to 80% of the computational time can be saved.",

Designed prototypes (the LSLM and bended LSLM) cover the frequency range of 698\u20132700\u00a0MHz (VSWR u003c 3), which would serve major LTE standards.

Low mutual coupling (lower than \u201323\u00a0dB) between the two antennas is achieved in the frequency range of 698\u20136000\u00a0MHz without any additional filters, and the design method is presented for better understanding the underlying physics.

Systematic investigation of measurement uncertainty is of great importance for developing a national measurement standard. The presence of a dielectric vapor cell containing alkali atoms changes the magnitude, polarization, and spatial distribution of the incident RF field. In this paper, the field distortion of rubidium vapor cells is investigated, in terms of both field strength distortion and depolarization. Full-wave numerical simulation and analysis are employed to determine general optimization solutions for minimizing such distortion and validated by measuring the E-field vector distribution inside different vapor cells. This work can improve the accuracy of atom-based RF E-field measurements and contributes to the development of related RF quantum sensors.",

FSIW-based horn antennas are very promising in millimeter wave applications. To improve the bandwidth and efficiency of such antennas, a thick substrate is preferred but the microstrip feeding line becomes unacceptly wide to obtain a reasonable impedance. This paper introduces compact microstrip feeding lines with elevated ground plane for thick FSIW. Arbitrary characteristic impedance can be achieved without increasing the width of the feeding line, which will be very useful for the integration with other millimeter circuit components.",

The issues like excessive cutting forces and machining damages are encountered in machining due to heterogeneity, anisotropy and low heat dissipation of these materials. The cutting forces are required to be predicted/minimized through modeling. In this article, the novel axial and feed cutting force model has been developed and validated through rotary ultrasonic slot milling of CFRP composites. The variations less than 10% have been found between the measured and corresponding simulated values of the cutting forces. However, some higher variations have also been observed in the few cases mainly due to heterogeneity and anisotropy of such material. The cutting depth is a significant parameter for axial and feed forces, while the feed rate is significant for the axia...",

A special measurement system is at first set up to get reliability of the bonding wire array, where a microscope is used to capture its fractures. The temperature distribution of the LDMOSFET die surface and bonding wire array is also captured by a thermal infrared scanner to investigate the principle underlying the failure of ETS fractures. Simulation studies are also performed. The temperature distribution is closely related to the profiles of the bonding wire array. Numerical methods are employed to calculate the bonding wire array, and the temperature distributions are demonstrated by using our finite-element method code. It also works well in solving the transient temperature of the bond wire array with the stationary current and the heat source from the silicon region. The simulated thermal results agree well with the testing results. Finally, an improved LDMOS design in optimizing the bonding wire profile is proposed. This research can serve as a guide for the design of an LDMOS PA with enhanced reliability.",

This time domain CMA is suitable for transmission and coupling problems, in which it represents the modal unit impulse response on specified ports.

An analytical expression of the relationship between the platform modal excitation coefficient and the platform modal charge is derived under the condition of a coaxial feeding mechanism. It is revealed that the deployment position that leads to a maximum isolation is indicated by the platform modal charge. Based on this finding, a simple and efficient method for antenna placement on aircraft-like platforms is developed to enhance the isolation. Two examples with vertically polarized blade antennas are presented, in which two or three blade antennas can be deployed on the platforms. Both the numerical and experimental results show that the isolation is increased remarkably by the proposed method.",

In this paper, it is studied for the first time using characteristic mode analysis (CMA). Mutual coupling between two antennas is separated into several fundamental modes, and the contribution of each mode is evaluated through modal mutual admittance (MMA). Some higher order modes, which contribute little to the in-band radiation but much to the out-of-band coupling, are discriminated and controlled by means of inductive loadings. The placement of loadings is suggested by the distribution of eigencurrents and optimum values are obtained by evaluating the MMA. Numerical and experimental results are presented for verification.",

        "abstract": "A figure of merit for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing antennas is first introduced and some design considerations are presented. A compact dipole antenna with curved reflector is proposed for 1.0-4.2 GHz EMC measurement. Structure of the curved reflector, defined by a power function, is studied by full-wave simulations and verified by experiments. A comparison between the curved reflector, corner reflector, and pyramidal reflector is presented and discussed. The presented antenna has nearly constant radiation patterns and realized gain. The minimum measurement distance is only 1.0 m for the proposed antenna, which reaches the lower limit recommended by CISPR. For small equipments under test, the measurement distance can be alternated and higher field strength can be provided by the proposed antenna without increasing the input power. In contrast, double-rigided horn antennas do not have the flexibility as they have much larger dimensions.",

A low-profile broadband antenna is proposed as the access point (AP) antenna, and then it is used as an identical array element for constructing two-and three-port multipleinput, and multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. The proposed MS-IDAS antenna covers various IEEE 802.11 standards within 2-6 GHz, and its link-level simulations are performed at 5 GHz for the 802.11n protocol. The error-rate performances of the three-element MIMO antenna is analyzed in WINNER indoor scenarios by using simulated-channelimpulse response (CIR). In a typical indoor-hotspot room with dimensions of 20 m x 20 m x 10 m, the wallmounted MS-IDAS antenna shows better coverage than the ceilingmounted case. In addition, the proposed MIMO antenna outperforms a uniform linear-dipole array with the same interelement distance in terms of error-rate performance.",

        "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems have proven to be very efficient for short-range and mid-range distances, but the transmission efficiency reduces rapidly when the distance is increasing. Multi-coil design based on magnetic resonance can be used to improve the efficiency when the distance is larger than 10 times the diameter of the coils. However, it takes a long computation time when analyzing WPT systems consisting of multiple coils in full-wave simulations. In this paper, a combination of equivalent circuit modeling (ECM) and 3D full-wave modeling based on the method of moments (MoM) is proposed to reduce the calculation time from days to minutes on a todayu0027s PC while the calculation accuracy remains acceptable. An optimization of a multi-coil WPT system is carried out with the proposed technique. For long transmission distances, the highest efficiency can be obtained with multiple coils of the same size and an optimum number along the transmission distance. It has to be ensured that the pitch between adjacent coils is equal to the diameter of the coils.",

First, borderlines are extracted from the borders of large connected components in a document image by using a run length based method. Second, after filtering out non-linear borderlines, a fast iteration algorithm is applied to optimize each linear borderline's directional angle. Finally, the weighted median value of all the directional angles is calculated as the skew angle of the whole document. Experiments on 2000 various skew document images are implemented. Total correct rate is 95.2%, and the detecting time on average is less than 0.2 s for each document. The proposed skew detection method is efficient for complex documents with horizontal and vertical text layout, three kinds of linguistic characters in English, Japanese and Chinese, especially for documents with predominant non-text regions or sparse text regions. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "In many eastern countries, a large number of seal images need to be identified every day. The system compares an input seal image with its reference seal and validates the authenticity of it. However, the reference seal is usually found manually. As each reference seal has quite a long corresponding ID, inputting ID to get the needed seal one by one costs quite a lot of time and this manual stage has become the bottleneck of automatic seal identification. To make the seal verification system more automatic, a new retrieval method based on Chinese characters' shape features will be introduced in this paper. Firstly, the main characters region is obtained by transforming the round seal image to a rectangle one and choosing the main part for each seal. Secondly, every single character is segmented using correlation method, and the number of characters in a seal can be got. Thirdly, four horizontal and four vertical features are extracted for each character in a seal and an eigenvector called position code is defined. Finally, the retrieval strategy is mainly based on transform from position code to a weight to decide which two seal images have the most similarity. Experiments on a database of 1000 testing seal images provide the retrieval ability for the proposed approach. The correct rate goes to 95.3%. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.",

First, because of the benefit that the vanishing point provides knowledge for clear path detection, we apply an example-based method to estimate initial vanishing point candidates. Then, instead of building a pre-trained clear path model over the limited training set, we propose an example-based global image matching method to get an approximate idea of clear path candidate regions, and use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for local image patch modeling to further improve the clear path detection. Finally, we develop an interactive probabilistic refinement to improve performance of both components. Experimental results of real road scenes are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Detecting objects in shadows is a challenging task in computer vision. For example, in clear path detection application, strong shadows on the road confound the detection of the boundary between clear path and obstacles, making clear path detection algorithms less robust. Shadow removal, relies on the classification of edges as shadow edges or non-shadow edges. We present an algorithm to detect strong shadow edges, which enables us to remove shadows. By analyzing the patch-based characteristics of shadow edges and non-shadow edges (e.g., object edges), the proposed detector can discriminate strong shadow edges from other edges in images by learning the distinguishing characteristics. In addition, spatial smoothing is used to further improve shadow edge detection. Numerical experiments show convincing results that shadows on the road are either removed or attenuated with few visual artifacts, which benefits the clear path detection. In addition, we show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms in different conditions.",

We first generate perspective patches for feature extraction in the image. Then, after extracting and selecting features of each patch, we estimate an initial probability that the patch corresponds to clear path using a support vector machine (SVM) based probability estimator on the selected features. We finally perform probabilistic patch smoothing based on spatial and temporal constraints to improve the initial estimate, thereby enhancing detection performance.

        "abstract": "Generally, in order to ensure the reliability of Navigation system, vehicles are usually equipped with two or more sets of inertial navigation systems (INSs). Fusion of navigation measurement information from different sets of INSs can improve the accuracy of autonomous navigation effectively. However, due to the existence of misalignment angles, the coordinate axes of different systems are usually not in coincidence with each other absolutely, which would lead to serious problems when integrating the attitudes information. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely calibrate and compensate the misalignment angles between different systems. In this paper, a dynamic calibration method of misalignment angles between two systems was proposed. This method uses the speed and attitude information of two sets of INSs during the movement of the vehicle as measurements to dynamically calibrate the misalignment angles of two systems without additional information sources or other external measuring equipment, such as turntable. A mathematical model of misalignment angles between two INSs was established. The simulation experiment and the INSs vehicle experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the calibration accuracy of misalignment angles between the two sets of systems can reach to 1\u2033 while using the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rotation modulation technology can enhance the autonomous navigation accuracy of inertial navigation system significantly, which has contributed to the wide applications of rotational inertial navigation system (RINS). To ensure the reliability and safety of high-precision autonomous navigation for the long endurance navigation in vehicle or marine applications, two or more RINSs are usually equipped. In this condition, the RINSs fault detection and isolation can be realized by comparing the differences of navigation information from different RINSs. In this paper, an on-line monitoring method for inertial device biases in the applications of two RINSs redundant configuration is proposed. The method takes advantages that the rotation modulation technology could improve the observable degrees of inertial device biases to achieve on-line optimal estimation of the gyro drifts and accelerometer biases for all the six gyros and accelerometers of the two RINSs. Two RINSs redundant configuration was presented and the inertial device biases estimation models were deduced. Based on the system model, simulations and experiments were both conducted. Simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed method could detect and isolate the faulty inertial devices of two RINSs effectively in autonomous navigation. Furthermore, gyro drifts monitoring accuracy could be better than 0.001\u00b0/h and accelerometer biases monitoring accuracy could be better than 1\u202f\u03bcg in cases where the random constant gyro drifts are 0.02\u00b0/h (    1  \u03c3    ) and random constant accelerometer biases are 50\u202f\u03bcg (    1  \u03c3    ), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed inertial device biases on-line monitoring method.",

Both the high-rate discharge capability and long term cycling performance of Li 3V 1.9Ti 0.05Fe 0.05(PO 4) 3 are much better than those of Li 3V 2(PO 4) 3, which can be attributed to the smaller particle size, larger lattice parameters and better structural stability induced by Ti and Fe codoping. However, the electrochemical performance of Li 3V 1.9Ti 0.05Mn 0.05(PO 4) 3 is worse than that of Li 3V 2(PO 4) 3, which is due to the structural instability induced by the incorporation of Mn. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A series of layered 0.6Li[Li1/3Mn2/3]O 2-0.4LiNi0.5-xMn0.5-xCo2xO 2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.5) materials are prepared by a carbonate coprecipitation method. The variation of the structural, morphological and electrochemical characteristics of these materials with Co content (x) is investigated. Each sample is single phase with layered structure in space group R3\u0304m. The lattice parameter a, c and V decrease, while the c/a ratio increases with an increase in Co content. This result suggests that higher cobalt content facilitates the formation of better hexagonal structure, which is beneficial to the electrochemical properties. However, the increase of Co content is always accompanied by the decrease of Ni and Mn content, which leads to a decrease in the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple and an increase in the structural instability, thus it is detrimental to the charge/discharge capacity and cycling stability. The former positive factor manifests itself when the cobalt content is relative low (x \u2264 0.12), while the latter negative factor becomes dominant when the cobalt content is higher (x\u22650.25). Therefore, only the materials with low cobalt content of 0.03 \u2264 x \u2264 0.12 have good electrochemical properties including high capacity, good rate capacity and excellent cycling stability. The 0.6Li[Li1/3Mn 2/3]O2-0.4LiNi0.38Mn0.38Co 0.24O2 (x = 0.12) sample shows the highest initial capacity of 218 mAh. g-1 and almost 100% capacity retention over fifty cycles, which is the best cobalt content in the series. \u00a9 2012 The Electrochemical Society.",

A citric acid assisted sol-gel method is employed in this study to prepare Li2MnSiO4/C composite, where carbon is in situ coated on Li2MnSiO4 during the synthetic process. The effect of in situ carbon coating on the structural, morphological and electrochemical characteristics is studied in detail. The particle size decreases whereas the amount of impurities increases with increasing amount of carbon. The Li2MnSiO4/C sample with 2.1 wt% carbon shows the best electrochemical performance, and the particle of it is uniformly coated by a thin layer of carbon. The carbon coating is incomplete if the amount of carbon is lower than 2.1 wt%. However, uneven thick layer and/or agglomerates of carbon are formed if the amount of carbon is higher than 2.1 wt%. Li+ transfer on the surface of particles will be hindered if the carbon layer is too thick. Although the smaller particles of the samples with 8.5 wt% and 10.5 wt% carbon have a positive effect on their electrochemical performance, the combined negative effect of higher amount of impurities and thicker carbon layer with carbon agglomerates finally lead to poorer electrochemical performance. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, both the\n discharge capacity and cycling performance at high rates (e.g., 1 and 2\u00a0C) are enhanced with proper amount of Cr doping (x\u2009=\u20090.1).

These are important clues for detecting lies and dangerous behaviors and therefore have potential applications in various fields such as the clinical field and national security. However, recognition through the naked eye is very difficult. Therefore, researchers in the field of computer vision have tried to develop micro-expression detection and recognition algorithms but lack spontaneous micro-expression databases. In this study, we attempted to create a database of spontaneous micro-expressions which were elicited from neutralized faces. Based on previous psychological studies, we designed an effective procedure in lab situations to elicit spontaneous micro-expressions and analyzed the video data with care to offer valid and reliable codings. From 1500 elicited facial movements filmed under 60fps, 195 micro-expressions were selected. These samples were coded so that the first, peak and last frames were tagged. Action units (AUs) were marked to give an objective and accurate description of the facial movements. Emotions were labeled based on psychological studies and participants' self-report to enhance the validity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Micro-expression has gained a lot of attention because of its potential applications (e.g., transportation security) and theoretical implications (e.g., expression of emotions). However, the duration of micro-expression, which is considered as the most important characteristic, has not been firmly established. The present study provides evidence to define the duration of micro-expression by collecting and analyzing the fast facial expressions which are the leakage of genuine emotions. Participants were asked to neutralize their faces while watching emotional video episodes. Among the more than 1,000 elicited facial expressions, 109 leaked fast expressions (less than 500 ms) were selected and analyzed. The distribution curves of total duration and onset duration for the micro-expressions were presented. Based on the distribution and estimation, it seems suitable to define micro-expression by its total duration less than 500 ms or its onset duration less than 260 ms. These findings may facilitate further studies of micro-expressions in the future.",

        "abstract": "Microexpressions are fleeting facial expressions that are important for judging people's true emotions. Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition of microexpressions (with duration of less than 200 ms) and macroexpressions (with duration of greater than 200 ms). We used an affective priming paradigm in which a picture of a facial expression is the prime and an emotional word is the target, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine neural activities associated with recognizing microexpressions and macroexpressions. The results showed that there were significant main effects of duration and valence for N170/vertex positive potential. The main effect of congruence for N400 is also significant. Further, sLORETA showed that the brain regions responsible for these significant differences included the inferior temporal gyrus and widespread regions of the frontal lobe. Furthermore, the results suggested that the left hemisphere was more involved than the right hemisphere in processing a microexpression. The main effect of duration for the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was significant, and the theta oscillations (4 to 8 Hz) increased in recognizing expressions with a duration of 40 ms compared with 300 ms. Thus, there are different EEG/ERPs neural mechanisms for recognizing microexpressions compared to recognizing macroexpressions. ",

        "abstract": "Micro-expressions, as fleeting facial expressions, are very important for judging people's true emotions, thus can provide an essential behavioral clue for lie and dangerous demeanor detection. From embodied accounts of cognition, we derived a novel hypothesis that facial feedback from upper and lower facial regions has differential effects on micro-expression recognition. This hypothesis was tested and supported across three studies. Specifically, the results of Study 1 showed that people became better judges of intense micro-expressions with a duration of 450 ms when the facial feedback from upper face was enhanced via a restricting gel. Additional results of Study 2 showed that the recognition accuracy of subtle micro-expressions was significantly impaired under all duration conditions (50, 150, 333, and 450 ms) when facial feedback from lower face was enhanced. In addition, the results of Study 3 also revealed that blocking the facial feedback of lower face, significantly boosted the recognition accuracy of subtle and intense micro-expressions under all duration conditions (150 and 450 ms). Together, these results highlight the role of facial feedback in judging the subtle movements of micro-expressions.",

To determine the mechanistic basis of AGE action in OA, we treated human articular chondrocytes with AGEs, and found that they not only up-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, but also inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and decreased sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) levels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonist restored the inhibited AMPK and SIRT-1 by AGEs. Pre-treatment of the cells with the agonists or antagonists of AMPK and SIRT-1 respectively abolished and augmented the inflammatory state induced by AGEs. Furthermore, AMPK agonist also restored the levels of SIRT-1 in the AGE-stimulated chondrocytes. Our findings indicate AGEs induce an inflammatory response in human articular chondrocytes via the PPAR\u03b3/AMPK/SIRT-1 pathway, which is therefore a potential target in OA therapy.",

        "abstract": "TRIB2 has been identified as an onco-protein, and O-GlcNAcylation of target proteins has been reported to stimulate transformative phenotypes in liver cancer cells. However, the relationships between TRIB2 and O-GlcNAcylation are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how O-GlcNAcylation and TRIB2 regulate each other. We found that stimulation of O-GlcNAcylation elevates TRIB2 by enhancing its protein stability. TRIB2 can be O-GlcNAcylated by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Also, O-GlcNAcylation boosting of transformative phenotypes of liver cancer cells might occur in a TRIB2-dependent manner. Interestingly, TRIB2 stimulated the metabolism of HBP, demonstrating that TRIB2 has positive feedback on O-GlcNAcylation. Notably, TRIB2 was found to maintain the stability of guanylate cyclase 1 alpha 3 (GUCY1A3), a key component of HBP, by interacting GUCY1A3 and reducing its ubiquitination. Importantly, TRIB2-dependent regulation of metabolism, transformative phenotypes, and O-GlcNAcylation all rely on GUCY1A3. Mouse experiments demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation of TRIB2 is much higher in the livers of diabetic mice compared to control mice, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation of TRIB2 might be critical for diabetes-associated liver cancer. Collectively, we have uncovered a positive auto-regulatory feedback between O-GlcNAcylation and TRIB2, which might be regarded as a promising therapeutic target for liver cancer. ",

Despite the pro-apoptotic effects of corosolic acid (CA) have been revealed, the methods to enhance its efficacy are unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the target that might reduce CA efficacy and figure out the way to conquer it. We found reduction of Yes-associated protein (YAP) might be a critical event that suppresses efficacy of CA. Treatment of CA accelerated degradation of YAP via enhancing its phosphorylation by LATS1. Moreover, we found CA boosts \u03b2TrCP-dependent Ubiquitination of YAP. Interestingly, the protein stability of \u03b2TrCP per se could be enhanced by CA. Notably, ActionomycinD (AD) strengthened CA-induced apoptosis of liver cancer cells via elevating YAP while down-regulating \u03b2TrCP. Importantly, combined treatment of CA and AD had much more obvious influences against transformative phenotypes of liver cancer cells than those under treatment of CA alone. Combined usage of AD successfully reduced IC50 value of CA. In summary, we have first uncovered that suppression of YAP might reduce efficacy of CA to treat liver cancer, combined treatment of AD and CA might solve this problem.",

        "abstract": "Here, bioinformatics data from Sirt1 knock-out (KO) and knock-in (KI) mice suggest that Sirt1 inhibits Wnt/\u03b2Catenin signaling in the liver. However, it is unclear how this relationship occurs and how it contributes to malignant phenotypes in liver cancer cells. We found that Sirt1 expression promotes phosphorylation of \u03b2Catenin at Ser675, which may subsequently decrease expression of total-\u03b2Catenin. Mechanistically, Sirt1 expression elevates phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of protein kinase A (PKA\u03b1), and this event is essential for Sirt1-induced phosphorylation of \u03b2Catenin. The negative effects of Sirt1 on \u03b2Catenin stability are also dependent on PKA\u03b1. Stimulating PKA\u03b1 recruits \u03b2TrCP, a well-known ubiquitin E3 ligase for \u03b2Catenin, to \u03b2Catenin. Interestingly, Sirt1 expression is able to up-regulate \u03b2TrCP expression. Finally, we found that malignant phenotypes occur in hepatocytes when Sirt1 and \u03b2Catenin are co-overexpressed, and such effects are enhanced by simultaneous knockdown of PKA\u03b1. In contrast, malignant phenotypes are abrogated upon knockdown of Sirt1, and this phenotype is magnified by knockdown of \u03b2Catenin. Collectively, we conclude that suppression of both Sirt1 and Wnt/\u03b2Catenin might be effective in treating liver cancer.",

Here, we show that TFCP2 is required for YAP-dependent transcription and liver malignancy. Mechanistically, YAP function is stimulated by TFCP2 via a WW-PSY interaction. TFCP2 also maintains YAP stability by inhibiting \u03b2TrCP. Notably, genomic co-occupancy of YAP and TFCP2 is revealed. TFCP2 acts as a transcription co-factor that stimulates YAP transcription by facilitating YAP binding with YAP binding motif (YBF)-containing transcription factors. Interestingly, TFCP2 also stimulated the YAP-TEAD interaction and TEAD target gene expression. Finally, several genes co-regulated by YAP and TFCP2 that contribute to YAP-dependent tumorigenesis are identified and verified. Thus, we establish a model showing that TFCP2 acts as a YAP co-factor to maintain YAP-dependent transcription in liver cancer cells, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of both YAP and TFCP2 may be an effective therapeutic approach.",

        "abstract": "Although it is generally accepted that diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for liver cancer, the underlying mechanism is still not well understood. The purpose of the current study is to further investigate how high concentrations of glucose (HG), a major symptom of diabetes, stimulate the development of liver malignancy. Using data mining, gap junction protein gamma 1 (GJC1) was identified as a critical proto-oncoprotein that is essential for the HG stimulation of proliferative capacity in liver cancer cells. Furthermore, enhanced transcriptional expression of GJC1 might occur after stimulation by HG. A transcription factor zinc finger protein 410 (APA1)-binding motif was found to be located at the -82 to -77 nt region within the GJC1 promoter. Without APA1, HG was unable to increase GJC1 expression. Interestingly, APA1, but not GJC1, can be O-GlcNAcylated in liver cancer cells. Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation is essential for HG-induced APA1 binding to the GJC1 promoter. Notably, global O-GlcNAcylation and expression of APA1 and GJC1 were highly elevated in liver cancer patients with diabetes compared to those in patients without diabetes. The HG-stimulated proliferative capacity was abolished upon decreasing O-GlcNAcylation, which could be reversed gradually by the simultaneous overexpression of APA1 and GJC1. Therefore, GJC1 could be a potential target for preventing liver cancer in patients with diabetes.",

However, its regulation mechanism and diagnostic roles are largely unknown. Here, we identified that circRNA_104075 (circ_104075) was highly expressed in HCC tissues, cell lines and serum. Mechanistically, HNF4a bound to the -1409 to -1401 region of the circ_104075 promoter to stimulate the expression of circ_104075. Moreover, circ_104075 acted as a ceRNA to upregulate YAP expression by absorbing miR-582-3p. Interestingly, an N-methyladenosine (mA) motif was identified in the 353-357 region of YAP 3'UTR, and this mA modification was essential for the interaction between miR-582-3p and YAP 3'UTR. Further, the diagnostic performance of circ_104075 was evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) for circ_104075 was 0.973 with a sensitivity of 96.0% and a specificity of 98.3%. Collectively, we determined that circ_104075 was highly expressed in HCC and elucidated its upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms. circ_104075 additionally has the potential to serve as a new diagnostic biomarker in HCC. Targeting circ_104075 may provide new strategies in HCC diagnosis and therapy.",

        "abstract": "Emerging studies have revealed that O-GlcNAcylation plays pivotal roles in the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancers. However, the underlying mechanism still remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that YY1 was O-GlcNAcylated by OGT and O-GlcNAcylation of YY1 could increase the protein expression by enhancing its stability. O-GlcNAcylation facilitated transformative phenotypes of CRC cell in a YY1-dependent manner. Also, O-GlcNAcylation stimulates YY1-dependent transcriptional activity. Besides, we also identified the oncoproteins, SLC22A15 and AANAT, which were regulated by YY1 directly, are responsible for the YY1 stimulated tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we identified the main putative O-GlcNAc site of YY1 at Thr236, and mutating of this site decreased the pro-tumorigenic capacities of YY1. We concluded that O-GlcNAcylation of YY1 stimulates tumorigenesis in CRC cells by targeting SLC22A15 and AANAT, suggesting that YY1 O-GlcNAcylation might be a potential effective therapeutic target for treating CRC.",

        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is an outcome of metabolic disorders and closely linked to liver cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the fine regulation of ferroptosis in liver cancer remains unclear. Here, we have identified two categories of genes: ferroptosis up-regulated factors (FUF) and ferroptosis down-regulated factors (FDF), which stimulate and suppress ferroptosis by affecting the synthesis of GSH. Furthermore, FUF are controlled by one transcription factor HIC1, while FDF controlled by another transcription factor HNF4A. Occurrence of ferroptosis might depend on the histone acetyltransferase KAT2B. Upon stimulation of ferroptosis, dissociation of KAT2B prevents HNF4A from binding to the FDF promoter. This effect happens prior to the recruitment of KAT2B to the FUF promoter, which facilitates HIC1 binding to transcribe FUF. Clinically, HIC1 and HNF4A conversely correlate with tumor stage in liver cancer. Patients with lower HIC1 and higher HNF4A exhibit poorer prognostic outcomes. Disrupting the balance between HIC1 and HNF4A might be helpful in treating liver cancer.",

        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a metabolism-related cell death. Stimulating ferroptosis in liver cancer cells is a strategy to treat liver cancer. However, how to eradicate liver cancer cells through ferroptosis and the obstacles to inducing ferroptosis in liver cancer remain unclear. Here, we observed that erastin suppressed the malignant phenotypes of liver cancer cells by inhibiting O-GlcNAcylation of c-Jun and further inhibited protein expression, transcription activity and nuclear accumulation of c-Jun. Overexpression of c-Jun-WT with simultaneous PuGNAc treatment conversely inhibited erastin-induced ferroptosis, whereas overexpression of c-Jun-WT alone or overexpression of c-Jun-S73A (a non-O-GlcNAcylated form of c-Jun) with PuGNAc treatment did not exert a similar effect. GSH downregulation induced by erastin was restored by overexpression of c-Jun-WT with simultaneous PuGNAc treatment. In addition, overexpression of c-Jun-WT, but not its S73A mutant, induced PSAT1 and CBS transcription via directly binding to their promoter regions, suggesting that GSH synthesis is regulated by O-GlcNAcylated c-Jun. A positive correlation between c-Jun O-GlcNAcylation and GSH was observed in clinical samples. Collectively, O-GlcNAcylated c-Jun represents an obstructive factor to ferroptosis, and targeting O-GlcNAcylated c-Jun might be helpful for treating liver cancer.",

Online channel is a wonderful way that can handle numerous queries every day. Even though the increasingly crucial role that E-services of airports websites is playing in the present tourism industry, the existing literature has largely overlooked the examination of content of airport websites. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of information provision on websites of international airports worldwide. Specifically, the research developed a framework of website quality for international airports. Forty-three website attributes were included in the framework, which were further grouped into four dimensions: flight schedule information, airport facilities information, passenger information, and others information. On the basis of the developed framework, the contents of sixty international airport websites were analyzed. Empirical findings showed mixed results with websites in different regions performing differently. The E-Service improvement suggestions and the implications for E-Tourism applications on existing airport websites are given. Future research is highlighted in the end.",

The image fusion process was formulated as a two-class classification problem: in and out-of-focus classes. First, a six-dimensional feature vector was extracted using sub-bands of dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) coefficients from the source images, which were then projected by a trained two-class support vector machine (SVM) to the class labels. A bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) was developed to obtain the optimal parameters of the SVM. The output of the classification system was used as a decision matrix for fusing high-frequency wavelet coefficients from multi-focus source images in different directions and decomposition levels of the DT-CWT. After the high and low-frequency coefficients of the source images were fused, the final fused image was obtained using the inverse DT-CWT. Several existing methods were compared with the proposed method. Experimental results showed that our presented method outperformed the existing methods, in visual effect and in objective evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive state, which is the inner mental state of a person while interacting with an artificial system through man-machine interface, can be affected by various factors, such as fatigue, stress, mental workload, attention deficit, and executive function, among others, which can lead to errors, accidents, or even disasters. One practical solution to this problem is to monitor and recognize the cognitive state of subjects via physiological signals. In this study, a hybrid adaptive flower pollination algorithm-Gaussian process model is proposed to recognize the cognitive state of in-flight pilots. Instead of using the traditional conjugate gradient technique to find optimal hyperparameters, an improved flower pollination algorithm is proposed. The adaptive L\u00e9vy strategy is then used to increase the robustness of this algorithm, as well as to enhance the global optimization and generalization capability of the Gaussian process model. In addition to conventional features in the time-frequency domain, a novel set of features involving wavelet singular entropy and autoregressive-moving average entropy is proposed to improve classification accuracy. Experiments are performed through flight simulations in a full flight simulator with six degrees of freedom. Comparable experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method for recognizing cognitive state and provide a wide range of conclusions on the feature selection and feature patterns of cognitive state.",

Affinity propagation (AP) is an efficient clustering technique to deal with datasets of many instances; however, it has oscillations and its preference value needs to be preset. This study proposes an improved cuckoo search (ICS) technique to solve the AP model. The ICS algorithm utilizes quaternions to represent individuals that are to be optimized. The variable step length of L\u00e9vy flights and a method of discovering probability are also proposed. The proposed adaptive AP based on ICS is utilized (or tested) to identify four standard test datasets, such as face images and handwritten digits. The proposed method produces highly accurate results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA)-Gaussian support vector classifier machine (GSVCM) model was proposed to improve the fatigue classification accuracy of electromyography (EMG) signals. This optimization mechanism involves the kernel parameter setting in the GSVCM training procedure, which significantly influences the classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted based on the EMG signal to differentiate the normal and fatigue status. In the proposed method, the EMG signals were decomposed into intrinsic mode functions by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) before the mean instantaneous frequency could be obtained by Hilbert transform (HT). Finally, the fatigue statistical features can be extracted from fast Fourier transform and EEMD-HT. The application of this model to the fatigue status recognition of EMG signal indicated that further significant enhancement of the classification accuracy can be achieved by the proposed BFA-GSVCM classification system. The diagnostic method is effective and feasible.",

In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for finding an effective sparse feature principal component (PC) of multiple physiological signals. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, it identifies an active index set with a desired cardinality corresponding to the nonzero entries of the PC. In the second one, it uses the power iteration method to find the best direction with respect to the active index set. Experiments on randomly generated data and multiple physiological signals datasets show that our algorithm is very fast, especially on large and sparse data sets, while the numerical quality of the solution is comparable to the state-of-art algorithm.",

For one thing, we applied wavelet packet transform to decompose electroencephalogram signals of pilots to extract the \u03b4 wave (0.4-3 Hz), \u03b8 wave (4-7 Hz), \u03b1 wave (8-13 Hz) and \u03b2 wave (14-30 Hz), and the combination of them was used as de-nosing electroencephalogram signals. For another, we proposed a deep contractive auto-encoding network-Softmax model for identifying pilots' fatigue status. Its recognition results were also compared with other models. The experimental results showed that the proposed deep learning model had a nice recognition, and the accuracy of recognition was up to 91.67%. Therefore, recognition of fatigue status of pilots based on deep contractive auto-encoding network is of great significance.",

The SOEC is a promising device for the sustainable development of energy and hydrogen economy. In this work, the steady-state performance of SOEC is tested under different gas compositions and modelled by extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. According to the experimental results, the concentrations of H 2 O and CO 2  influence the performance of SOEC. For the model, the inputs are the operating voltage and volume percentage of H 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O, while the output is the performance (current) of SOEC. The obtained model has correlation coefficients of higher than 0.999 and root mean square error less than 0.018, which means that the predicted data by the model well matches the experimental results. Then, the obtained ELM model is used to analyse the performances of SOEC under different concentrations of feedstock. Thus, this data driven ELM model is suitable for many instances of fast modelling for individual group and may be helpful to save the cost, time and effort to build a model for the purpose of performance analysis and system level design.",

Firstly, the delta wave (0.5~4Hz), theta wave (5~8Hz), alpha wave (7~14Hz) and beta wave (14~30Hz) are extracted by multi-scale decomposition of electroencephalogram signals using filters, and the reconstruction of them are input vectors of the model. Secondly, a deep contractive sparse auto-encoding network-Softmax model is proposed for identifying pilotsu0027 fatigue status and its recognition results are also compared with those of the deep auto-encoding network-Softmax and traditional PCA-Softmax model. Lastly, the results show that the proposed deep learning model not only has a nice classification, whose accuracy rate is up to 91.17%, but also the learned features is stable, and the proposed model is stable and reusable verified.",

        "abstract": "Irisin, a newly discovered myokine, is considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we used two animal models, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed on a high-cholesterol diet and a mouse carotid partial ligation model to test the anti-atherosclerotic effect of irisin. Irisin treatment (0.5 \u03bcg/g body weight/day) significantly reduced the severity of aortic atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed on a high-cholesterol diet and suppressed carotid neointima formation in a carotid partial ligation model. It was associated with decreased inflammation and cell apoptosis in aortic tissues. In addition, in a cell culture model, irisin restored ox-LDL-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell dysfunction by reducing the levels of inflammatory genes via inhibiting the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/ p38 MAPK/ NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation and inhibiting cell apoptosis via up-regulating Bcl-2 and down-regulating Bax and caspase-3 expression. Our study demonstrated that irisin significantly reduced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice via suppressing ox-LDL-induced cell inflammation and apoptosis, which might have a direct therapeutic effect on atherosclerotic diseases.

However, little is known about the role of irisin in the progression of atherosclerosis.Methods and Results We used a carotid partial ligation model of apolipoprotein E\u2013deficient mice fed on a high\u2010cholesterol diet to test the anti\u2010atherosclerosis effect of irisin. Irisin treatment significantly suppressed carotid neointima formation. It was associated with increased endothelial cell proliferation. In addition, irisin promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cell survival via upregulating microRNA126\u20105p expression through the ERK signaling pathway. Inhibition of microRNA126\u20105p using the microRNA126\u20105p inhibitor abolished the prosurvival effect. The same results were demonstrated in\u00a0vivo as the expression of microRNA126\u20105p noticeably increased in ligated carotid artery after irisin treatment. Furthermore, in\u00a0vivo blockade of microRNA126\u20105p expression using the antagomir abolished the inhibitory effects of irisin on neointima formation, lesional lipid deposition, macrophage area, and the pro\u2010proliferation effects on endothelial cells.Conclusions Taken together, our study demonstrates that irisin significantly reduces atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E\u2013deficient mice via promoting endothelial cell proliferation through microRNA126\u20105p, which may have a direct therapeutic effect on atherosclerotic diseases.",

        "abstract": "The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor delivers inhibitory checkpoint signals to activated T cells upon binding to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on antigen-presenting cells and cancer cells, resulting in suppression of T-cell effector function and tumor immune evasion. Clinical antibodies blocking the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 restore the cytotoxic function of tumor antigen-specific T cells, yielding durable objective responses in multiple cancers. This report describes the preclinical characterization of REGN2810, a fully human hinge-stabilized IgG4(S228P) high-affinity anti-PD-1 antibody that potently blocks PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2. REGN2810 was characterized in a series of binding, blocking, and functional cell-based assays, and preclinical  studies in mice and monkeys. In cell-based assays, REGN2810 reverses PD-1-dependent attenuation of T-cell receptor signaling in engineered T cells and enhances responses of human primary T cells. To test the  activity of REGN2810, which does not cross-react with murine PD-1, knock-in mice were generated to express a hybrid protein containing the extracellular domain of human PD-1, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse PD-1. In these mice, REGN2810 binds the humanized PD-1 receptor and inhibits growth of MC38 murine tumors. As REGN2810 binds to cynomolgus monkey PD-1 with high affinity, pharmacokinetic and toxicologic assessment of REGN2810 was performed in cynomolgus monkeys. High doses of REGN2810 were well tolerated, without adverse immune-related effects. These preclinical studies validate REGN2810 as a potent and promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy. .",

        "abstract": "Most patients with cancer do not develop durable antitumor responses after programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) checkpoint inhibition monotherapy because of an ephemeral reversal of T cell dysfunction and failure to promote long-lasting immunological T cell memory. Activating costimulatory pathways to induce stronger T cell activation may improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition and lead to durable antitumor responses. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of more than 2000 tumor-infiltrating CD8 +  T cells in mice receiving both PD-1 and GITR (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013related protein) antibodies and found that this combination synergistically enhanced the effector function of expanded CD8 +  T cells by restoring the balance of key homeostatic regulators CD226 and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), leading to a robust survival benefit. Combination therapy decreased CD8 +  T cell dysfunction and induced a highly proliferative precursor effector memory T cell phenotype in a CD226-dependent manner. PD-1 inhibition rescued CD226 activity by preventing PD-1\u2013Src homology region 2 (SHP2) dephosphophorylation of the CD226 intracellular domain, whereas GITR agonism decreased TIGIT expression. Unmasking the molecular pathways driving durable antitumor responses will be essential to the development of rational approaches to optimizing cancer immunotherapy.",

The three cell types were treated with or without recombinant ANGPTL8 to investigate its role in lipid metabolism. Hydrodynamic tail vein gene delivery was also used to examine the role of ANGPTL8 in mice.ANGPTL8 is significantly up-regulated in amino acid-deprived cultured cells in vitro. Activation of ANGPTL8 gene transcription was mediated through the RAS/c-RAF/MAPK signaling pathway rather than the general GCN2/ATF4 pathways. ANGPTL8 activated the ERK signal transduction pathway in hepatocytes, adipocytes and pancreatic \u03b2-cells, up-regulating early growth response transcription factor (Egr1) and down-regulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL).ANGPTL8 is a stress-response protein that regulates fat metabolism by suppressing ATGL expression, revealing a mechanistic connection between ANGPTL8 and lipid homeostasis in mammalian cells.",

Although global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances are recognized to shape animal population demography their contribution to panda population dynamics remains largely unknown. We sequenced the whole genomes of 34 pandas at an average 4.7-fold coverage and used this data set together with the previously deep-sequenced panda genome to reconstruct a continuous demographic history of pandas from their origin to the present. We identify two population expansions, two bottlenecks and two divergences. Evidence indicated that, whereas global changes in climate were the primary drivers of population fluctuation for millions of years, human activities likely underlie recent population divergence and serious decline. We identified three distinct panda populations that show genetic adaptation to their environments. However, in all three populations, anthropogenic activities have negatively affected pandas for 3,000 years.",

The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and red panda (Ailurus fulgens) belong to different families in the order Carnivora, but both have evolved a specialized bamboo diet and adaptive pseudothumb, representing a classic model of convergent evolution. However, the genetic bases of these morphological and physiological convergences remain unknown. Through de novo sequencing the red panda genome and improving the giant panda genome assembly with added data, we identified genomic signatures of convergent evolution. Limb development genes DYNC2H1 and PCNT have undergone adaptive convergence and may be important candidate genes for pseudothumb development. As evolutionary responses to a bamboo diet, adaptive convergence has occurred in genes involved in the digestion and utilization of bamboo nutrients such as essential amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins. Similarly, the umami taste receptor gene TAS1R1 has been pseudogenized in both pandas. These findings offer insights into genetic convergence mechanisms underlying phenotypic convergence and adaptation to a specialized bamboo diet.",

        "abstract": "Wild giant pandas use different parts of bamboo (shoots, leaves and stems) and different bamboo species at different times of the year. Their usage of bamboo can be classified temporally into a distinct leaf stage, shoot stage and transition stage. An association between this usage pattern and variation in the giant panda gut microbiome remains unknown. Here, we found associations using a gut metagenomic approach and nutritional analyses whereby diversity of the gut microbial community in the leaf and shoot stages was significantly different. Functional metagenomic analysis showed that in the leaf stage, bacteria species over-represented genes involved in raw fibre utilization and cell cycle control. Thus, raw fibre utilization by the gut microbiome was guaranteed during the nutrient-deficient leaf stage by reinforcing gut microbiome robustness. During the protein-abundant shoot stage, the functional capacity of the gut microbiome expanded to include prokaryotic secretion and signal transduction activity, suggesting active interactions between the gut microbiome and host. These results illustrate that seasonal nutrient variation in wild giant pandas substantially influences gut microbiome composition and function. Nutritional interactions between gut microbiomes and hosts appear to be complex and further work is needed.",

Although some studies have explored the effects of the GC content and parsimony informative sites (PIS) on the phylogenetic tree, the effect of the heterogeneity of the GC content at the first/second/third codon position on parsimony informative sites (GC1/2/3) among different species and the effect of PIS on phylogenetic tree construction remain largely unexplored. Here, we used two different mammal genomic datasets to explore the patterns of GC1/2/3 heterogeneity and the effect of PIS on the phylogenetic tree of genes: (i) all GC1/2/3 have obvious heterogeneity between different mammals, and the levels of heterogeneity are GC3\u202f>\u202fGC2\u202f>\u202fGC1; (ii) the number of PIS is positively correlated with the metrics of \"good\" gene tree topologies, and excluding the third codon position (C3) decreases the quality of gene trees by removing too many PIS. These results provide novel insights into the heterogeneity pattern of GC1/2/3 in mammals and the relationship between GC3/PIS and gene trees. Additionally, it is necessary to carefully consider whether to exclude C3 to improve the quality of gene trees, especially in the super-tree method.",

Here, we aimed to identify potential adaptive evolutionary signatures compatible with high purine and fat metabolism based on analysis of host genomes and symbiotic gut microbial metagenomes. We found that the gut microbiomes of carnivorous Carnivora (e.g. Felidae, Canidae) clustered in the same clade, and other clades comprised omnivorous and herbivorous Carnivora (e.g. badgers, bears and pandas). The relative proportions of genes encoding enzymes involved in uric acid degradation were higher in the gut microbiomes of meat-eating carnivorans than plant-eating species. Adaptive amino acid substitutions in two enzymes, Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1A) and Lipase F (LIPF), which play a role in fat digestion, were identified in Felidae-Candidae species. Carnivorous carnivorans appear to endure diets high in purines and fats via gut microbiomic and genomic adaptations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "The explosively accumulated mammalian genomes have provided a valuable resource to characterize the evolution of the Y chromosome. Unexpectedly, the Y-chromosome sequence has been characterized in only a small handful of species, with a majority of them being model organisms. Thus, identification of Y-linked scaffolds from unordered genome sequences is becoming more important. Here, we used a syntenic-based approach to generate the scaffolds of male specific region in Y chromosome (MSY) from the genome sequence of 6 male carnivore species. Our results identified 14, 15, 9, 28, 14 and 11 Y-linked scaffolds in polar bear, pacific walrus, red panda, cheetah, ferret and tiger, covering 1.55Mbp, 2.62Mbp, 964Kb, 1.75Mb, 2.17Mbp and 1.84Mb MSY, respectively. All of the candidate Y-linked scaffolds in three selected species (red panda, polar bear and tiger) were successfully verified using PCR. We re-annotated these Y-linked scaffolds plus with domestic dog and cat MSY, a total of 11 orthologous genes conserved in at least 7 of the 8 carnivores were identified. These 11 Y-linked genes have significantly higher evolutionary rates compared with their X-linked counterparts, indicating less purifying selection for MSY genes. Taken together, our study shows that the approach of synteny search is a reliable and easily affordable strategy to identify Y-linked scaffolds from unordered carnivore genome and provides a preliminary evolutionary study for carnivore MSY genes.

However, using SNP as a genetic marker, GWAS has been confined to detect genetic basis traits only for within species but not for the large-scale inter-species traits. Here, we propose a practical statistical approach that is using kmer frequencies as the genetic markers to associate genetic variants with large scale inter-species traits. We applied this new approach to the trait of chromosome number in 96 mammalian proteomes, and we prioritized 130 genes including TP53 and BAD, of which 6 were candidate genes. These genes were proved to be associated with cellular reaction of DNA double-strand breaks caused by chromosome fission/fusion. Our study provides a new effective genomic strategy to perform association studies for large-scaled inter-species traits, using the chromosome number as a case. We hope this approach could provide exploration for broadly widely traits.",

        "abstract": "Giant pandas are unusual in belonging to a primarily carnivorous clade and yet being extremely specialized herbivores that feed almost exclusively on highly fibrous bamboo [1]. Paradoxically, they appear inconsistently adapted to their plant diet, bearing a mix of herbivore and carnivore traits. Herbivore traits include a skull, jaw musculature, and dentition that are adapted for fibrous diets and a specialized \"pseudo-thumb\" used for handling bamboo [2, 3]. They have lost functional versions of the T1R1 gene codes for umami taste receptors, which are often associated with meat eating [3]. They also have an herbivore-like subcellular distribution of the metabolic enzyme alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase [4]. But meanwhile, giant pandas have a digestive tract [5], digestive enzymes [6], and a gut microbiota composition that resemble those of carnivores and not of herbivores [6, 7]. We draw on recent developments in multi-dimensional niche theory [8] to examine this apparent paradox. We show that the pandas' diet clustered in a macronutrient space among carnivores and was distinct from that of herbivores. The similarity with carnivore diets applied not only to the ingested diet but also to the absorbed diet, with the absorbed macronutrient ratios similar to those of the ingested foods. Comparison of the macronutrient composition of pandas' milk with those of other species shows that the carnivore-like dietary macronutrient composition extends across the life cycle. These results cast new light on the seemingly incongruous constellation of dietary adaptations in pandas, suggesting that the transition\u00a0from carnivorous and omnivorous ancestry to specialized herbivory might be less abrupt than it might otherwise appear.",

This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we first propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We further show that the same mechanism can be used to incorporate external knowledge, which is critically important for answering high level visual questions. Specifically, we design a visual question answering model that combines an internal representation of the content of an image with information extracted from a general knowledge base to answer a broad range of image-based questions. It particularly allows questions to be asked about the contents of an image, even when the image itself does not contain a complete answer. Our final model achieves the best reported results on both image captioning and visual question answering on several benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) has attracted much attention in both computer vision and natural language processing communities, not least because it offers insight into the relationships between two important sources of information. Current datasets, and the models built upon them, have focused on questions which are answerable by direct analysis of the question and image alone. The set of such questions that require no external information to answer is interesting, but very limited. It excludes questions which require common sense, or basic factual knowledge to answer, for example. Here we introduce FVQA (Fact-based VQA), a VQA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. FVQA primarily contains questions that require external information to answer. We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which contains image-question-answer triplets, through additional image-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. Each supporting-fact is represented as a structural triplet, such as <Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees>.",

Given an image and a question in natural language, it requires reasoning over visual elements of the image and general knowledge to infer the correct answer. In the first part of this survey, we examine the state of the art by comparing modern approaches to the problem. We classify methods by their mechanism to connect the visual and textual modalities. In particular, we examine the common approach of combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to map images and questions to a common feature space. We also discuss memory-augmented and modular architectures that interface with structured knowledge bases. In the second part of this survey, we review the datasets available for training and evaluating VQA systems. The various datatsets contain questions at different levels of complexity, which require different capabilities and types of reasoning. We examine in depth the question/answer pairs from the Visual Genome project, and evaluate the relevance of the structured annotations of images with scene graphs for VQA. Finally, we discuss promising future directions for the field, in particular the connection to structured knowledge bases and the use of natural language processing models.",

        "abstract": "One of the most intriguing features of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) challenge is the unpredictability of the questions. Extracting the information required to answer them demands a variety of image operations from detection and counting, to segmentation and reconstruction. To train a method to perform even one of these operations accurately from {image, question, answer} tuples would be challenging, but to aim to achieve them all with a limited set of such training data seems ambitious at best. Our method thus learns how to exploit a set of external off-the-shelf algorithms to achieve its goal, an approach that has something in common with the Neural Turing Machine [10]. The core of our proposed method is a new co-attention model. In addition, the proposed approach generates human-readable reasons for its decision, and can still be trained end-to-end without ground truth reasons being given. We demonstrate the effectiveness on two publicly available datasets, Visual Genome and VQA, and show that it produces the state-of-the-art results in both cases.",

        "abstract": "Much recent progress in Vision-to-Language (V2L) problems has been achieved through a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we investigate whether this direct approach succeeds due to, or despite, the fact that it avoids the explicit representation of high-level information. We propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We also show that the same mechanism can be used to introduce external semantic information and that doing so further improves performance. We achieve the best reported results on both image captioning and VQA on several benchmark datasets, and provide an analysis of the value of explicit high-level concepts in V2L problems.",

        "abstract": "The visual dialog task requires an agent to engage in a conversation about an image with a human. It represents an extension of the visual question answering task in that the agent needs to answer a question about an image, but it needs to do so in light of the previous dialog that has taken place. The key challenge in visual dialog is thus maintaining a consistent, and natural dialog while continuing to answer questions correctly. We present a novel approach that combines Reinforcement Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS) to generate more human-like responses to questions. The GAN helps overcome the relative paucity of training data, and the tendency of the typical MLE-based approach to generate overly terse answers. Critically, the GAN is tightly integrated into the attention mechanism that generates human-interpretable reasons for each answer. This means that the discriminative model of the GAN has the task of assessing whether a candidate answer is generated by a human or not, given the provided reason. This is significant because it drives the generative model to produce high quality answers that are well supported by the associated reasoning. The method also generates the state-of-the-art results on the primary benchmark.",

By directly optimizing for questions that work quickly towards fulfilling the overall goal, we avoid the tendency of existing methods to generate long series of insane queries that add little value.

There are a great many practical applications where the subjects that may be of interest are not known beforehand, or so easily delineated, however. In many of these cases natural language dialog is a natural way to specify the subject of interest, and the task achieving this capability (a.k.a, Referring Expression Comprehension) has recently attracted attention. To this end we propose a unified framework, the ParalleL AttentioN (PLAN) network, to discover the object in an image that is being referred to in variable length natural expression descriptions, from short phrases query to long multi-round dialogs. The PLAN network has two attention mechanisms that relate parts of the expressions to both the global visual content and also directly to object candidates. Furthermore, the attention mechanisms are recurrent, making the referring process visualizable and explainable. The attended information from these dual sources are combined to reason about the referred object. These two attention mechanisms can be trained in parallel and we find the combined system outperforms the state-of-art on several benchmarked datasets with different length language input, such as RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and GuessWhat?!.",

This is significant because a robot interpreting a natural-language navigation instruction on the basis of what it sees is carrying out a vision and language process that is similar to Visual Question Answering. Both tasks can be interpreted as visually grounded sequence-to-sequence translation problems, and many of the same methods are applicable. To enable and encourage the application of vision and language methods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions, we present the Matter-port3D Simulator - a large-scale reinforcement learning environment based on real imagery [11]. Using this simulator, which can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we provide the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language navigation in real buildings - the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset1.",

        "abstract": "Much of the recent progress in Vision-to-Language problems has been achieved through a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we first propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We further show that the same mechanism can be used to incorporate external knowledge, which is critically important for answering high level visual questions. Specifically, we design a visual question answering model that combines an internal representation of the content of an image with information extracted from a general knowledge base to answer a broad range of image-based questions. It particularly allows questions to be asked where the image alone does not contain the information required to select the appropriate answer. Our final model achieves the best reported results for both image captioning and visual question answering on several of the major benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant progress in a variety of vision-and-language problems, developing a method capable of asking intelligent, goal-oriented questions about images is proven to be an inscrutable challenge. Towards this end, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework based on three new intermediate rewards, namely goal-achieved, progressive and informativeness that encourage the generation of succinct questions, which in turn uncover valuable information towards the overall goal. By directly optimizing for questions that work quickly towards fulfilling the overall goal, we avoid the tendency of existing methods to generate long series of inane queries that add little value. We evaluate our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset and show that the resulting questions can help a standard \u2018Guesser\u2019 identify a specific object in an image at a much higher success rate.",

        "abstract": "As Computer Vision algorithms move from passive analysis of pixels to active reasoning over semantics, the breadth of information algorithms need to reason over has expanded significantly. One of the key challenges in this vein is the ability to identify the information required to make a decision, and select an action that will recover this information. We propose an reinforcement-learning approach that maintains an distribution over its internal information, thus explicitly representing the ambiguity in what it knows, and needs to know, towards achieving its goal. Potential actions are then generated according to particles sampled from this distribution. For each potential action a distribution of the expected answers is calculated, and the value of the information gained is obtained, as compared to the existing internal information. We demonstrate this approach applied to two vision-language problems that have attracted significant recent interest, visual dialogue and visual query generation. In both cases the method actively selects actions that will best reduce its internal uncertainty, and outperforms its competitors in achieving the goal of the challenge.",

Encouraging an agent to ask the right questions is difficult because we donu0027t know a-priori what information the agent will need to achieve its task, and we donu0027t have an explicit model of what it knows already. We propose a solution to this problem based on a Bayesian model of the uncertainty in the implicit model maintained by the visual dialogue agent, and in the function used to select an appropriate output. By selecting the question that minimises the predicted regret with respect to this implicit model the agent actively reduces ambiguity. The Bayesian model of uncertainty also enables a principled method for identifying when enough information has been acquired, and an action should be selected. We evaluate our approach on two goal-oriented dialogue datasets, one for visual-based collaboration task and the other for a negotiation-based task. Our uncertainty-aware information-seeking model outperforms its counterparts in these two challenging problems.",

As a language-to-vision matching task, the key to this problem is to learn a discriminative object feature that can adapt to the expression used. To avoid ambiguity, the expression normally tends to describe not only the properties of the referent itself, but also its relationships to its neighbourhood. To capture and exploit this important information we propose a graph-based, language-guided attention mechanism. Being composed of node attention component and edge attention component, the proposed graph attention mechanism explicitly represents inter-object relationships, and properties with a flexibility and power impossible with competing approaches. Furthermore, the proposed graph attention mechanism enables the comprehension decision to be visualisable and explainable. Experiments on three referring expression comprehension datasets show the advantage of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "One of the long-term challenges of robotics is to enable humans to communicate with robots about the world. It is essential if they are to collaborate. Humans are visual animals, and we communicate primarily through language, so human-robot communication is inevitably at least partly a vision-and-language problem. This has motivated both Referring Expression datasets, and Vision and Language Navigation datasets. These partition the problem into that of identifying an object of interest, or navigating to another location. Many of the most appealing uses of robots, however, require communication about remote objects and thus do not reflect the dichotomy in the datasets. We thus propose the first Remote Embodied Referring Expression dataset of natural language references to remote objects in real images. Success requires navigating through a previously unseen environment to select an object identified through general natural language. This represents a complex challenge, but one that closely reflects one of the core visual problems in robotics. A Navigator-Pointer model which provides a strong baseline on the task is also proposed.",

        "abstract": "The Classification of medical images and illustrations in the literature aims to label a medical image according to the modality it was produced or label an illustration according to its production attributes. It is an essential and challenging research hotspot in the area of automated literature review, retrieval and mining. The significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity caused by the diverse imaging modalities and various illustration types brings a great deal of difficulties to the problem. In this paper, we propose a synergic deep learning (SDL) model to address this issue. Specifically, a dual deep convolutional neural network with a synergic signal system is designed to mutually learn image representation. The synergic signal is used to verify whether the input image pair belongs to the same category and to give the corrective feedback if a synergic error exists. Our SDL model can be trained u0027end to endu0027. In the test phase, the class label of an input can be predicted by averaging the likelihood probabilities obtained by two convolutional neural network components. Experimental results on the ImageCLEF2016 Subfigure Classification Challenge suggest that our proposed SDL model achieves the state-of-the art performance in this medical image classification problem and its accuracy is higher than that of the first place solution on the Challenge leader board so far.",

        "abstract": "Automated skin lesion classification in the dermoscopy images is an essential way to improve diagnostic performance and reduce melanoma deaths. Although deep learning has shown proven advantages over traditional methods, which rely on handcrafted features, in image classification, it remains challenging to classify skin lesions due to the significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. In this paper, we propose a synergic deep learning (SDL) model to address this issue, which not only uses dual deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) but also enables them to mutually learn from each other. Specifically, we concatenate the image representation learned by both DCNNs as the input of a synergic network, which has a fully connected structure and predicts whether the pair of input images belong to the same class. We train the SDL model in the end-to-end manner under the supervision of the classification error in each DCNN and the synergic error. We evaluated our SDL model on the ISIC 2016 Skin Lesion Classification dataset and achieved the state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "Deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated advanced performance on single-label image classification, and various progress also has been made to apply CNN methods on multilabel image classification, which requires annotating objects, attributes, scene categories, etc., in a single shot. Recent state-of-the-art approaches to the multilabel image classification exploit the label dependencies in an image, at the global level, largely improving the labeling capacity. However, predicting small objects and visual concepts is still challenging due to the limited discrimination of the global visual features. In this paper, we propose a regional latent semantic dependencies model (RLSD) to address this problem. The utilized model includes a fully convolutional localization architecture to localize the regions that may contain multiple highly dependent labels. The localized regions are further sent to the recurrent neural networks to characterize the latent semantic dependencies at the regional level. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, especially for predicting small objects occurring in the images. Also, we set up an upper bound model (RLSD+ft-RPN) using bounding-box coordinates during training, and the experimental results also show that our RLSD can approach the upper bound without using the bounding-box annotations, which is more realistic in the real world.",

        "abstract": "The number of social images has exploded by the wide adoption of social networks, and people like to share their comments about them. These comments can be a description of the image, or some objects, attributes, scenes in it, which are normally used as the user-provided tags. However, it is well-known that user-provided tags are incomplete and imprecise to some extent. Directly using them can damage the performance of related applications, such as the image annotation and retrieval. In this paper, we propose to learn an image annotation model and refine the user-provided tags simultaneously in a weakly-supervised manner. The deep neural network is utilized as the image feature learning and backbone annotation model, while visual consistency, semantic dependency, and user-error sparsity are introduced as the constraints at the batch level to alleviate the tag noise. Therefore, our model is highly flexible and stable to handle large-scale image sets. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

By using tag relevance as guidance, we generate three tag sub-sets and use them to fulfill the annotation.

The high digital signal processing (DSP) complexity has become one of the most significant obstacles to experimentally demonstrating real-time high-capacity OOFDM transceivers. In this paper, stage-dependent clipping of FFT DSP operation dynamic range is proposed and extensively explored, for the first time, based on which an improved stage-dependent minimum bit resolution map is numerically identified by taking into account the DSP operation dynamic range-clipping and precision of FFT DSP operations. The validity and high accuracy of the identified minimum bit resolution map is experimentally verified in 25\u00a0km SSMF OOFDM transmission systems based on intensity modulation and direct detection. Experimental results show that, compared to a previously reported FFT stage-dependent bit resolution map including the FFT DSP operation precision only, the improved minimum bit resolution map offers significant bit resolution reductions of up to 3-bits for full-parallel pipelined 64-point FFT architectures. As a direct result, an approximately 30% reduction in FPGA logic resource usage is achievable compared to the spiral FPGA design.",

        "abstract": "Salvianolic acid B (SalB), a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the herb of Salvia miltiorrhiza, possesses antioxidant and neuroprotective properties and has been shown to be beneficial for diseases that affect vasculature and cognitive function. Here we investigated the protective effects of SalB against subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced oxidative damage, and the involvement of underlying molecular mechanisms. In a rat model of SAH, SalB inhibited SAH-induced oxidative damage. The reduction in oxidative damage was associated with suppressed reactive oxygen species generation; decreased lipid peroxidation; and increased glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase activities. Concomitant with the suppressed oxidative stress, SalB significantly reduced neurologic impairment, brain edema, and neural cell apoptosis after SAH. Moreover, SalB dramatically induced nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation and increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 and NADPH: quinine oxidoreductase-1. In a mouse model of SAH, Nrf2 knockout significantly reversed the antioxidant effects of SalB against SAH. Additionally, SalB activated sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression, whereas SIRT1-specific inhibitor sirtinol pretreatment significantly suppressed SalB-induced SIRT1 activation and Nrf2 expression. Sirtinol pretreatment also reversed the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of SalB. In primary cultured cortical neurons, SalB suppressed oxidative damage, alleviated neuronal degeneration, and improved cell viability. These beneficial effects were associated with activation of the SIRT1 and Nrf2 signaling pathway and were reversed by sirtinol treatment. Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro findings suggest that SalB provides protection against SAH-triggered oxidative damage by upregulating the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway, which may be modulated by SIRT1 activation.",

        "abstract": "Inflammation plays a key role in the progression of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Here, we examined the effects of astaxanthin (ATX) on the inflammatory response and secondary damage after SAH and the underlying mechanisms of action. In vivo, a prechiasmatic cistern injection model was established in rats and mice. In addition, neuron-microglia cocultures were exposed to oxyhemoglobin to mimic SAH in vitro. Western blotting revealed that protein expression of TLR4 was markedly increased in microglia at 24 h after SAH, with consequent increases in the downstream molecules myeloid differentiation factor 88 and NF-\u043aB. Treatment with ATX significantly inhibited the TLR4 activation, increased sirtuin 1 expression, and inhibited the subsequent inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. ATX also significantly decreased high-mobility group box 1 nuclear translocation and secretion in neurons, an effect that was reversed by the sirtuin 1-specific inhibitor sirtinol. ATX administered 4 h after SAH ameliorated cerebral inflammation, brain edema, and neuronal death and improved neurologic function. ATX reduced neuronal death but did not improve neurologic function in TLR4 knockout mice. These results suggest that ATX reduces the proinflammatory response and secondary brain injury after SAH, primarily by increasing sirtuin 1 levels and inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway.-Zhang, X., Lu, Y., Wu, Q., Dai, H., Li, W., Lv, S., Zhou, X., Zhang, X., Hang, C., Wang, J.

        "abstract": "The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of amphiphilic copolymer micelles on six major hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. A series of mPEG-PCL polymeric micelles (mPEG-PCL, mPEG-PCL, mPEG-PCL and mPEG-PCL) ranging from 20 to 100 nm were prepared to investigate the inhibitory or inductive activities by in vitro incubations of rat liver microsomes and primary rat hepatocytes. Inhibition of these polymeric micelles on CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, CYP2D2 and CYP3A1/2 isoenzymes were observed above their critical micelle concentrations (>10 \u03bcg\u00b7mL) and in a concentration-dependent manner. The mPEG-PCL micelles showed the strongest inhibition of CYP1A2, followed by CYP2C11. The micelles with lower molecular weight PCL segment exhibited more potent inhibitory potential. Induction on CYP1A2, CYP2B1 and CYP3A1/2 activity (2.1 \u223c 7.2-fold, 1.5 \u223c 2.4-fold and 1.3 \u223c 3.0-fold, respectively) were detected at all tested concentrations (0.1 \u223c 1000 \u03bcg\u00b7mL or 0.1 \u223c 100 \u03bcg\u00b7mL). Accordingly, most of the mRNA levels were upregulated. As demonstrated in ex vivo fluorescence imaging results, the mPEG-PCL micelles mainly accumulated in the liver after intravenous administration. In conclusion, mPEG-PCL micelles can interfere with the normal metabolic function of CYP450s in vitro, indicating polymeric micelles as promising drug nano-carriers might cause micelle-drug interaction and the in vivo interaction deserves further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been proven to play a critical role in neuroinflammation and to represent an important therapeutic target following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Resveratrol (RSV), a natural occurring polyphenolic compound, has a powerful anti-inflammatory property. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of RSV in protecting against early brain injury (EBI) after SAH remain obscure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of RSV on the TLR4-related inflammatory signaling pathway and EBI in rats after SAH. A prechiasmatic cistern SAH model was used in our experiment. The expressions of TLR4, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) were evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The expressions of Iba-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain cortex were determined by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Neural apoptosis, brain edema, and neurological function were further evaluated to investigate the development of EBI. We found that post-SAH treatment with RSV could markedly inhibit the expressions of TLR4, HMGB1, MyD88, and NF-\u03baB. Meanwhile, RSV significantly reduced microglia activation, as well as inflammatory cytokines leading to the amelioration of neural apoptosis, brain edema, and neurological behavior impairment at 24 h after SAH. However, RSV treatment failed to alleviate brain edema and neurological deficits at 72 h after SAH. These results indicated that RSV treatment could alleviate EBI after SAH, at least in part, via inhibition of TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. ",

        "abstract": "Early Brain Injury, rather than Cerebral Vasospasm, has been demonstrated to be more important for patients with Subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is considered that allicin can make sense in a wide range of pharmacological areas and can be taken as a therapeutic method in many pathologic situations. We have explored the potential effect of allicin and possible mechanisms in Early Brain Injury after Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage in Rats. With therapy (70\u202fmg/kg Allicin, rather than 30\u202fmg/kg) 30\u202fmin post SAH, groups showed better neurological scores in 24\u202fh. Significant differences could be found in body weight ratio between the SAH\u202f+\u202fvehicle groups and SAH\u202f+\u202fAllicin groups. Treatment with 70\u202fmg/kg, not 30\u202fmg/kg, Allicin significantly reduced brain edema and EB extravasation in 24\u202fh after SAH. Assessments in 24\u202fh after SAH showed that treatment with 70\u202fmg/kg Allicin in 30\u202fmin after SAH significantly restrained the expression of cleaved caspase-3, mitigated the severity of neuronal degeneration, decreased the proportion of apoptotic neurons and the elevated MDA levels, and increased the suppressed GSH and SOD levels. We demonstrated for the first time that Allicin extenuated brain edema and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, improved neurological outcomes by the suppression of apoptosis and oxidative stress damage after SAH in experimental models, which may shade new light on the treatments of SAH.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the preparation of Fe3O4/PTX/HSA nanoparticles with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and slow release functionality by a self-assembly method is presented. Firstly, hydrophobic Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm are synthesized by thermal decomposition of an iron\u2013oleate complex and then modified and stabilized by hydrophobic paclitaxel (PTX). Lastly, Fe3O4/PTX nanoparticles with a 3 nm PTX shell on the Fe3O4 surface are loaded into human serum albumin (HSA) to form uniform Fe3O4/PTX/HSA nanoparticles by PTX\u2013HSA interaction after breaking the disulfide bond and unfolding hydrophobic region of HSA. The novel PTX modified Fe3O4/PTX nanoparticles have good dispersity in ethanol and strong binding capacity with HSA, which can be homogenously dispersed in HSA matrices to form novel Fe3O4/PTX/HSA nanoparticles with a pie structure by the self-assembly method. The resulting Fe3O4/PTX/HSA nanoparticles with a high saturation magnetization value of 10.2 emu g\u22121, good T2 imaging functionality and excellent ability to cross the cell membrane have been demonstrated by magnetization curves, in vitro MRI and cellular uptake. Furthermore, the in vitro antitumor ability of the system has also been evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Background  Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a severe cerebrovascular accident with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between level of inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aSAH patients, the severity of aSAH, and the outcome of aSAH patients.    Methods  aSAH patients were prospectively included and followed-up for 6 months. CSF samples were collected at 1\u20133, 4\u20136, and 7\u20139 days after aSAH onset. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in the CSF of aSAH patients were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.    Results  Eighty-one aSAH patients were enrolled. The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and TNF-\u03b1 in the CSF were especially higher in the group of aSAH patients with cerebral edema, cerebral vasospasm, and a high grade on Hunt-Hess scale, the high World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades, and Fisher grade ( P   P      Conclusions  The levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1 in CSF were elevated in aSAH patients and were positively associated with cerebral edema and acute hydrocephalus. Our findings suggest that CSF inflammatory cytokines might be biomarkers to assess severity and predict outcomes.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFR\u03b2 enhanced crosstalk among the various components of the neurovascular unit, leading to synaptic recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The soluble PDGF-BB from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH was measured. The relationship between PDGF-BB treatment and astrocytic PDGFR\u03b2 signaling was further explored  and  in experimental SAH models. Compared with the levels in the control samples, the PDGF-BB protein levels in the CSF of patients with SAH were significantly increased. After the generation of experimental SAH, astrocyte activation markers were markedly induced by the binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFR\u03b2, accompanied by improved levels of synaptic recovery and cognitive function. Soluble PDGF-BB and astrocytic PDGFR\u03b2 signaling are essential for the neuroprotective effect in the hippocampus and the coculture system  after SAH that otherwise leads to cognitive dysfunction and neuronal damage.-Zhou, X., Wu, Q., Lu, Y., Zhang, X., Lv, S., Shao, J., Zhou, Y., Chen, J., Hou, L., Huang, C., Zhang, X.

        "abstract": "Abstract   We have previously shown that astaxanthin (ATX) reduces the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neurovascular dysfunction following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) insults. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. It is known that the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of secondary brain injury after SAH. And ATX has the ability to regulate MMP-9 in other models. Herein, we investigated whether ATX could ameliorate MMP-9 activation and expression in a rat model of SAH. A total of 144 rats were randomly divided into the following groups: control group ( n =36), SAH group ( n =36), SAH+vehicle group ( n =36), and SAH+ATX group ( n =36). The SAH model was induced by injection of 0.3\u00a0ml autologous blood into the prechiasmatic cistern. ATX (20\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1\u00a0mmol) or vehicle was administered intracerebroventricularly 30\u00a0min after SAH induction. Mortality, neurological function, brain edema and blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability were measured at 24 and 72\u00a0h after SAH. Biochemical and zymographic methods were used to analyze MMP-9 expression and activity in brain samples. Immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining were also evaluated at 24\u00a0h. Our data indicated that ATX could significantly reduce the expression and activity of MMP-9, leading to the amelioration of brain edema, BBB impairment, neurological deficits and TUNEL-positive cells at 24\u00a0h but not 72\u00a0h after SAH. The ATX-mediated down-regulation of MMP-9 was correlated with the decreased levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, oxidative stress, activated microglia and infiltrating neutrophils. These results suggest that the neurovascular protection of ATX in SAH is partly associated with the inhibition of MMP-9 expression and activity.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasonic wave-sensing technology has been applied for the health monitoring of composite structures, using normal fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors with a high-speed wavelength interrogation system of arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) filters; however, researchers are required to average thousands of repeated measurements to distinguish significant signals. To resolve this bottleneck problem, this study established a signal-processing strategy that improves the signal-to-noise ratio for the one-time measured signal of ultrasonic waves, by application of parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) technology that produces unique multiway decomposition without additional orthogonal or independent constraints. Through bandpass processing of the AWG filter and complex wavelet transforms, ultrasonic wave signals are preprocessed as time, phase, and frequency profiles, and then decomposed into a series of conceptual three-way atoms by PARAFAC. While an ultrasonic wave results in a Bragg wavelength shift, antiphase fluctuations can be observed at two adjacent AWG ports. Thereby, concentrating on antiphase features among the three-way atoms, a fitting atom can be chosen and then restored to three-way profiles as a final result. An experimental study has revealed that the final result is consistent with the conventional 1024-data averaging signal, and relative error evaluation has indicated that the signal-to-noise ratio of ultrasonic waves can be significantly improved.

The uniaxial compression and 3-point bending tests were conducted to determine the compressive strength and flexural strength. The experimental results imply that the steel fiber outperforms the polypropylene fiber and polyvinyl alcohol fiber in improving compressive and flexural strength. The sequent repeated drop weight impact tests for each mixture concrete specimens were performed to study the effect of hybrid fiber reinforcement on the impact energy. It is suggested that the steel fiber incorporation goes moderately ahead of the polypropylene or polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforcement in terms of the impact energy improvement. Moreover, the impact toughness of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete as well as steel-polyvinyl alcohol hybrid fiber reinforced concrete was studied to relate failure and first crack strength by best fitting. The impact toughness is significantly improved due to the positive hybrid effect of steel fiber and polymer fiber incorporated in concrete. Finally, the hybrid effect index is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the hybrid fiber reinforcement effect on the impact energy improvement. When steel fiber content exceeds polyvinyl alcohol fiber content, the corresponding impact energy is found to be simply sum of steel fiber reinforced concrete and polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced concrete.",

The effect of viscoelasticity on FBG-based sensing has been comprehensively researched through theoretical analysis and simulation using a finite-element approach, and a further data processing method to reconstruct the graphical data has been developed. An integrated sensor package comprising an FBG-based sensor in a polymer host and manufactured by using three-dimensional (3D) printing was investigated and examined through tensile testing to validate the approach. The application of the 3D-printed FBG-based sensor package, coupled with the data process method, has been explored to monitor the height of a railway pantograph, a critical measurement requirement to monitor elongation, employing a method that can be used in the presence of electromagnetic interference. The results show that the effect of viscoelasticity can be effectively eliminated, and the graphical system response allows results that are sufficiently precise for field use to be generated.",

        "abstract": "Because the static strain measured by a uniform fiber Bragg grating is a mean value along the grating length, it is difficult to precisely measure a local strain when encountering nonuniformity. It is found that phase-shifted fiber Bragg gratings have short effective grating length and reflectivity approaching one at the central peak; these properties are beneficial for improving the spatial resolution. These advantages have been validated by calculating the light power distribution along the grating and by spectrum simulation using the transfer-matrix method integrated with finite element simulation. An interrogation system integrated with a newly designed algorithm has been used to automatically track the wavelength shift in the central peak. A set of comparison experiments that mimicked symmetrically parabolic strain and linearly increasing strain were conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating over the conventional fiber Bragg grating in static measurements.",

In this research, a high-performance optical fiber sensor using phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating and balanced demodulation system was applied to detect the fundamental and second harmonic Lamb waves propagating in an aluminum plate. After the nonlinearity was calculated from the modes of the Lamb waveform detected by the optical fiber sensor, its change due to the second harmonic generation shows an exponential trend in a fatigue test, which can be used to evaluate the crack growth with sufficient reliability.

There has been a demand for developing a structural health monitoring method to evaluate micro-sized fatigue cracks, as cracking is considered as a precursor to structural failure. However, conventional linear-ultrasound-based technology is not sensitive to crack when it is barely visible in a metal medium. In this article, we present a nonlinear ultrasonic technology based on crack\u2013wave interaction to investigate the growth of a fatigue crack. A breathing-crack model with a plastic zone around it was precisely established to reveal the change in the Lamb wave. The relative nonlinear parameter calculated from the fundamental and harmonic components of the Lamb wave showed linearly increasing with the growth of the fatigue crack. The relative nonlinearity was related to ultrasonic parameters, such as the cycle number and the excited frequency of the tone-burst signal. In addition, it was also related to the ang...",

By leveraging existing ultrasonic optical fiber sensors based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technique, we proposed a novel sensing concept in which the ultrasonic-induced Bragg wavelength shift was demodulated by an erbium fiber laser (EFL). The ultrasonic sensor and light source, i.e., an FBG and EFL, were seamlessly integrated into a fiber laser sensor system, in which the output power change directly represents the ultrasonic signal. In addition to discussing the theory behind the sensor, we focused on the applications and actual performance of the sensor, including sensitivity, bandwidth, and robustness, in practical ultrasonic SHM. We were able to constantly detect ultrasonic signals in the range of 25 \u00b0C\u201385 \u00b0C or simultaneously detect static measurands (temperature or strain) and ultrasonic signals by changing the position of the FBG where it is attached. Because of the diverse structures of the EFL and FBG, we created, investigated, and compared three sensing systems with different properties and advantages to find their most suitable applications and fully explore their maximum potential. In addition, the experimental results from these novel optical fiber sensors were compared to those from a conventional broadband PZT sensor. The results showed that the new sensor has some unique advantages, such as self-adjustable ultrasonic detection.",

To achieve the high-temperature AE detection, a remote AE measurement based on a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG) sensor with a high sensitivity over a broad bandwidth was proposed. The common optical fibers were made from glass with good heat resistance. Hence, in this method, optical fiber was used as the waveguide to propagate the AE in the composite from a high-temperature environment to the room-temperature environment wherein the PS-FBG was located. Owing to the special AE detection configuration, this method was a new adhesive method for remote measurement (ADRM). The experiment and numerical simulation revealed that the PS-FBG sensor in the ADRM configuration demonstrated accurate remote sensing for the AE signals. This was because of the good waveguide system provided by the thin optical fiber and the sensitivity of the PS-FBG sensor to the axial strain in the core of the fiber. Consequently, the remote measurement utilizing the PS-FBG sensor in the ADRM configuration has a high potential for AE detection in high-temperature conditions.",

Based on AE detection, this research proposed a novel method to identify damage types in carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. Because the PS-FBG sensor measured pure dynamic strain, the detected AE signals had great physical reliability, which made elastic wave theory suitable for analysis of the signal. The analysis clarified the different characteristics of Lamb wave modes in three types of AEs caused by a transverse crack, delamination and fiber breakage. Additionally, the ratios of the amplitudes of the S 0  mode to the A 0  mode and the peak frequencies quantitatively evaluated the mode characteristics in the AE signals. Simultaneously using the two physical parameters, we identified the three types of damage among the AE signals detected in a three-point bending test. Furthermore, the finite element method-based AE wave propagation simulation agreed well with the identification results. Hence, the proposed identification method with the PS-FBG sensor has great physical reliability for evaluating damage in composite laminates.",

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and prognostic value of MCTs used by immunohistochemistry and quantum dots-based fluorescent imaging technique in BC and surrounding stroma with emphasis on the interaction between tumour and stroma. Moreover, the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed to evaluate the association between MCTs mRNA expression and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Our study found that MCT1 overexpression was observed in hormone receptor-negative and high-proliferation subtypes. High expression of MCT1 and MCT4 in tumour tissues was associated with poor patient outcome; further the correlation between MCT1 expression and poor prognosis in breast cancer was further strengthened when combined with MCT4 overexpression in the adjacent adipose tissue. These results demonstrate that MCTs tend to play a role in the aggressive BC subtypes through the dynamic interaction between breast cancer cells and adipocytes, and developing therapeutics to block this interaction will be a promising strategy in cancer therapy.",

The prognostic value of DNER in prostate cancer has not been evaluated. Here we showed that the up-regulation of DNER protein was observed in prostate cancer detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantum dot-based immunofluorescent imaging and quantitative analytical system (QD-IIQAS). However, a higher accuracy of measurements of DNER expression in prostate cancer was found by QD-IIQAS than by IHC (AUC = 0.817 and 0.617, respectively). DNER was significantly higher in patients undergoing bone metastasis (P = 0.045, RR = 3.624). In addition, DNER overexpression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (P = 0.028, adjusted HR = 8.564) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.042, adjusted HR = 3.474) in patients suffering prostate cancer. Thus, QD-IIQAS is an easy and accurate method for assessing DNER and the DNER expression was an independent prognostic factor in prostate cancer.",

However, the mediators and mechanisms that mediate cancer-induced cachexia remain unclear. Here, we show that breast cancer-derived exosomes alter adipocytes and muscle cells in terms of increased catabolism characterized by the release of metabolites. Likewise, tumour cells cocultivated with mature adipocytes or C2C12 exhibit an aggressive phenotype through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, we show that cancer cell-secreted miR-155 promotes beige/brown differentiation and remodel metabolism in resident adipocytes by downregulating the PPAR\u03b3 expression, but does not significantly affect biological conversion in C2C12. In vitro the use of propranolol ameliorates tumour exosomes-associated cachectic wasting through upregulating the PPAR\u03b3 expression. These results demonstrate that cancer-derived exosomes reprogram systemic energy metabolism and accelerate cancer-associated cachexia to facilitate tumour progression.",

Methods: Using data obtained by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 2010-2013, a retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted to investigate tumor subtype-specific differences in various characteristics, overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM).   Results: In all, 6867 patients with BCIS were eligible during the 2010-2013 study period. Compared with the hormone receptor (HoR)+/HER- subgroup, patients with triple negative (TN) breast cancer were more likely to have tumors that were higher in grade and larger in size; they were also more likely to have tumors with ductal and comedo histology and were less likely to have tumors with cribriform and papillary histology (each  P  u003c 0.05). During the follow-up period, patients with TN breast cancer had an OS of 97.0% compared with 98.6 % in the HoR+/HER- subgroup ( P  u003c 0.05). Furthermore, the BCSM rate was 1.0% for the TN group compared with 0.1% for the HoR+/HER- subgroup ( P  u003c 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with TN MBC had a poorer OS and BCSM ( P  u003c0.05). Multivariate analysis of OS with respect to the local treatment history showed that patients who received breast-conserving surgery (BCS) combined with radiotherapy (R) were more likely to have an improved OS ( P  u003c 0.05). Moreover, the results demonstrated that patients who underwent SLNB were more likely to have a lower BCSM ( P  u003c 0.05).   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that BCIS appears to alter the prognosis associated with the TN subtype. Meanwhile, BCS plus R was a preferable option and resulted in survival rates that were better than those achieved with mastectomy; thus, SLNB should be considered as an appropriate assessment of axillary staging in patients with BCIS.",

        "abstract": "The crucial interplay between metabolic remodeling and the epigenetics could contribute to promote cancer progression. A remarkable association within interaction, LKB1 has been reported, suggesting that the expression of key enzymes involving  de novo  serine synthesis and DNA methyltransferases like DNMT1 and DNMT3A increase LKB1-deficiency cells. However, the complex interactional link between metabolic remodeling and the epigenetics is still unclear. Hence, we focus on the relationship between YAP/TAZ and serine metabolism to control methylation of DNA or histone in breast cancer with LKB1 deficiency. We hypothesize that YAP/TAZ may have the function to activate key enzymes involving serine metabolism like PSPH and up-regulate the amino acid transporters to supply sources of serine synthesis through activation of C-MYC with TEAD1. Further, we speculate that YAP/TAZ in dependent of FOS may promote DNMT1 and subsequently mediate DNMT1\u2013G9A complex involving serine metabolism and the methylation of DNA and histone. We hope that our study will stimulate further studies and a new targeted therapy and early medical intervention for YAP/TAZ could be a useful option for breast cancer cases complicated with LKB1 deficiency.",

Herein, hydrogen-bonded organic aromatic frameworks (HOAFs) with different pore sizes were constructed through intense intralayer \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, firstly achieving ultralong phosphorescence in metal-free porous materials under ambient conditions. Impressively, yellow UOP with a lifetime of 79.8 ms was realized for PhTCz-1, lasting for several seconds upon ceasing the excitation. For PhTCz-2 and PhTCz-3, on account of oxygen dependent phosphorescence quenching, UOP can only be visualized in N\u2082, demonstrating the potential of phosphorescence porous materials for oxygen sensing. This result not only outlines a principle for the design of new HOFs with high thermal stability, but also expands the scope of metal-free luminescent materials with UOP feature.",

        "abstract": "Metal-free organic phosphorescence materials are of imperious demands in optoelectronics and bioelectronics. However, it is still a formidable challenge to develop a material with simultaneous efficiency and lifetime enhancement under ambient conditions. In this study, we design and synthesize a new class of high efficient ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials through self-assembly of melamine and aromatic acids in aqueous media. A supramolecular framework can be formed via multiple intermolecular interactions, building a rigid environment to lock the molecules firmly in a three-dimensional network, which not only effectively limits the non-radiative decay of the triplet excitons, but also promotes the intersystem crossing. Thus, the supermolecules we designed synchronously achieve an ultralong emission lifetime of up to 1.91 s and a high phosphorescence quantum efficiency of 24.3% under ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance of UOP materials with simultaneous efficiency and lifetime enhancement. Furthermore, it is successfully applied in a barcode identification in darkness. This result not only paves the way toward high efficient UOP materials, but also expands their applications.",

To date, it remains a formidable challenge to develop a highly sensitive visual system for selective detection of VOCs. Herein, we report on a metal-free organic molecule of 2,4-di(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (TDP) with ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) feature as a visible chemical probe for chloroform detection. In the pristine solid state, this phosphor shows a green UOP with a lifetime of 56 ms after the removal of excitation light source; however, the UOP greatly diminishes when fumed with chloroform, which is ascribed to variation of both radiative and non-radiative transitions in crystal with chloroform embedded. Remarkably, TDP materials demonstrate great potential as a visual chemical probe for chloroform, showing high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and good repeatability. The limitation for chloroform detection is as low as 5 ppm. Combining experimental data and theoretical calculations, it is reasoned that the space confinement via intermolecular interactions between chloroform and TDP molecules play a vital role for high selectivity of chloroform detection. These results pave the way toward expanding the scope of organic luminogens with UOP as well as their applications.",

        "abstract": "Many luminescent probes have been developed for intracellular imaging and sensing. During cellular luminescence sensing, it is difficult to distinguish species generated inside cells from those internalized from extracellular environments since they are chemically the same and lead to the same luminescence response of the probes. Considering that endogenous species usually give more information about the physiological and pathological parameters of the cells while internalized species often reflect the extracellular environmental conditions, we herein reported a series of cyclometalated iridium(iii) complexes as phosphorescent probes that are partially retained in the cell membrane during their cellular uptake. The utilization of the probes for sensing and distinguishing between exogenous and endogenous analytes has been demonstrated using hypoxia and hypochlorite as two examples of target analytes. The endogenous analytes lead to the luminescence response of the intracellular probes while the exogenous analytes are reported by the probes retained in the cell membrane during their internalization.",

The theranostic agent has favorable renal excretion and low cytotoxicity, making it of great interest in the nanomedical field. Herein, a water-soluble conjugated zwitterionic polymer (DPP-SPMA) with low-fouling and low cytotoxicity was prepared and used for fluorescence/PA imaging guided PTT/PDT therapy. The in vivo imaging results showed that the DPP-SPMA had excellent enhanced permeability and retention effects. The fluorescence imaging demonstrated that the DPP-SPMA was excreted by renal metabolism because the controlled molecular mass was less than the renal filtration threshold. The DPP-SPMA shows a photothermal effect under 730 nm irradiation and an excellent singlet oxygen generation capacity for the PDT therapy under 635 nm irradiation. The high accumulation of DPP-SPMA by passive targeting around the tumor stimulated excellent synergistic photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy. As a result, the water-soluble zwitterion DPP-SPMA was well suited for fluorescence/PA dual-modal imaging and had significant antitumor activity in vivo via synergistic photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.",

        "abstract": "Applications of the second near infrared (NIR) optical window (NIR-II, 1000\u20131700 nm) have received increasing attention with respect to reduced scattering and negligible auto-fluorescence, thus achieving a high signal-to-background ratio for pinpointing tumors compared with NIR-I imaging. Conjugated polymers have been applied in NIR-II imaging for their advantages, such as high molar extinction coefficient, wide emission wavelength, and ease of preparation. However, currently available conjugated polymer NIR-II agents suffer from a lack of water solubility. Hence, a highly water-soluble triblock conjugated polymer (POEGMA-b-PDPP-b-POEGMA) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole was successfully prepared with a high yield. The NIR-II imaging depth of the conjugated polymer was \u223c7 mm, which is far beyond conventional NIR-I agents. Furthermore, the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of POEGMA-b-PDPP-b-POEGMA reached up to 1.0%, which is higher than most reported NIR-II probes. This novel NIR-II conjugated polymer shows improved solubility (u003e10 mg mL\u22121) and greater dispersion in aqueous solution compared to those conventional conjugated polymers, due to the introduction of the water-soluble polymer POEGMA. With the help of high emission (u003e1000 nm), POEGMA-b-PDPP-b-POEGMA could efficiently realize the highly penetrable NIR-II imaging of tumors. In addition, POEGMA-b-PDPP-b-POEGMA could be a promising photothermal therapy agent to ablate tumors due to its high photothermal conversion efficiency (52%).",

Herein, for the first time, we report a concise chemical strategy to prolong the lifetime of ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) via dihydrogen bonding. On slighlty tailoring alkyl chain in their molecular structure, the phosphorescence lifetime of the as-prepared triazine derivatives increased by 25% (to 788 ms) under ambient conditions. Moreover, tunable ultralong luminescence was realized with various excitation wavelengths. Significantly, a white persistent luminescence was obtained, for the first time, when the excitation at 300 nm was switched off. Combining theoretical simulations and single crystal analysis, we conclude that the polar dihydrogen bonds of C\u2013H\u22efH\u2013N in the DCzNT crystal play a critical role in increasing the lifetime of the UOP. In addition, the ultralong phosphors were successfully applied to anti-counterfeiting of a currency bill. These results can offer a new platform towards tuning the lifetime of UOP and expanding the scope of organic phosphorescence materials and their optoelectronic applications.",

First, using the microstrip technique, a new dualresonance unit cell is proposed for the reflectarray, which provides an approximately linear phase response of 0-360 range. Additionally, its phase response curves are nearly parallel within a broad band, which can widen the operating bandwidth of the reflectarray antenna. Then, using the proposed unit cells, a 1296-element reflectarray antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. Finally, measured results show that the boresight gain is 31.9 dBi and the 1-dB bandwidth is greater than 29.3% at Q-band.

By employing the substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) and half-mode SIW (HMSIW) techniques in antenna designs, low-profile cavity-backed structures are realized using the low-cost standard printed circuit board process. First, a novel spoon-shaped slot antenna is proposed to realize CP radiation based on the SIW cavity. Then, to minimize the antenna size and achieve the impedance bandwidth enhancement, the HMSIW cavity is introduced to realize a cavity-backed semicircle slot antenna (SSA). The equivalence between the edge of the HMSIW cavity and the longitude slot curved on the surface of the SIW cavity is proposed to guide the design process of the SSA. In addition, two hybrid modes are used to improve the impedance bandwidth of the SSA. Furthermore, a sequential rotation antenna array is introduced to validate the feasibility of the SSA for antenna array application. Finally, the proposed antennas and the antenna array are designed and fabricated at 28 GHz. The measured and simulated results agree very well.",

First, the stacked curl element is aperture-fed, using the substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) feeding network. This element is designed under a specific boundary condition, which leads to an excellent agreement of impedance bandwidth and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth between the designed element and the corresponding antenna array. Simulation results show that the antenna element achieves 35.8% impedance bandwidth and 37.8% 3 dB AR bandwidth with a maximum gain of 8.2 dBic. Then, a 2  2 subarray is designed to achieve 33.1% impedance bandwidth. Next, the full-corporate SIW feeding scheme is utilized to construct the 88 broadband antenna array. Finally, the 88 antenna array is fabricated and its performance is evaluated. Measurement results show that its impedance bandwidth is 35.4%, 3 dB AR bandwidth is 33.8%, and 3 dB gain bandwidth is 32.2% with a peak gain of 23.5 dBic. Considering these three types of bandwidth together, its overall bandwidth is 30.6%. Good efficiency of about 70% is obtained because of the low-loss full-corporate SIW feeding scheme. A 4  4 multibeam array is also simulated to verify the multibeam potential of the proposed antenna array.",

Firstly, a new dual-resonance unit cell is proposed for the single-layer reflectarray, which provides an approximately linear phase response during 0-360\u00b0 range. Additionally, its phase response curves are nearly parallel within a broad band, which can widen the bandwidth. Then, a 576-element reflectarray of size 12\u03bb\u00d712\u03bb using the proposed unit cell is designed and analyzed. Simulation results show that the boresight gain is 27.9 dBi and the 1-dB bandwidth is greater than 39.78% at Q band.",

The proposed design method can achieve conversion between the SLL and half-power beamwidth (HPBW). The constraint conditions for the IES and amplitude are set up, and the element size is also taken into account in the pattern function. Based on the solutions from the DEA, two types of series-fed antenna arrays of unequal IES, i.e., uniform amplitude and nonuniform amplitude arrays, are designed, fabricated, and measured. Measurement results show that 8- and 10-element series-fed antenna arrays of unequal IES and nonuniform amplitude can achieve the SLL of -23.7 dB with HPBW of 9.7\u00b0 and the SLL of -25.3 dB with HPBW of 8.3\u00b0, respectively.

        "abstract": "Two types of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity-backed slot (CBS) antennas are proposed for bandwidth enhancement. First, a quad-resonance SIW CBS antenna is proposed using a cross-shaped slot and loading unbalanced shorting vias. Additional half-  $textrm {TE}_{120}$   mode is successfully excited along with three other independent modes including half-  $textrm {TE}_{110}$   and odd and even   $textrm {TE}_{210}$   modes. Next, a penta-resonance SIW CBS antenna with a cross-shaped slot is proposed, in which two pairs of shorting vias are loaded. Two additional hybrid modes of half-  $textrm {TE}_{210}$   and half-  $textrm {TE}_{120}$   modes are introduced along with three other independent modes including half-  $textrm {TE}_{110}$   and odd and even   $textrm {TE}_{310}$   modes. Furthermore, the working mechanism of these two types of SIW CBS antennas is explained. Finally, prototypes of these two antennas are fabricated and measured at  X -band. Their measured fractional bandwidths are   $text{20.0}%$   and   $text{20.8}%$  , respectively. Simulation and measurement results agree very well, which confirms the validity of the proposed designs.",

A longitudinal slot is etched on the patch surface to change the original E-field distribution of the TM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">20</sub>\n mode without affecting that of the TM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub>\n mode. This etching also tunes the resonance frequencies of these two modes to be sufficiently close to each other. Therefore, the antenna is able to realize good impedance performance within the wide designated bandwidth. Moreover, two transverse slots are etched to suppress undesirable modes, but the slots have a small effect on the current distribution of the two designed modes. Thus, the antenna is able to realize a stable radiation pattern and low cross-polarization within the whole operating band. The proposed patch antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured around the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Ka$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-band. The fabricated prototype achieves a wide impedance bandwidth of 45.4%. The simulated total efficiency of the proposed antenna is more than 85.0%. The proposed broadband symmetrical E-shaped patch antenna has a very simple structure and great electrical performance and is a very attractive candidate for 5G mmWave applications.",

        "abstract": "The chiral organic-inorganic hybrid materials can exhibit a high loading, and the chiral selector nanoparticles can create efficient stationary phases for open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC). Hence, a novel protocol for the preparation of an OT column coated with nano-amylose-2,3-bis(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (nano-ABDMPC)-silica hybrid sol through in situ layer-by-layer self-assembly method was developed for CEC enantioseparation. By controlling the assembly cycle number of nano-ABDMPC-silica hybrid sol, a homogeneous, dense and stable coating was successfully prepared, which was confirmed by SEM and elemental analysis. As the main parameter influencing the chiral separating effect, the nano-ABDMPC bearing 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl residues concentration was investigated. The experimental results showed that 10.0 mg mL nano-ABDMPC bearing 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl residues coated OT capillary column possessed chiral recognition ability toward the six enantiomers (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, phenethyl alcohol, 1-phenyl-2-propanol, and Tr\u00f6ger's base) at some of the different conditions tested. Additionally, the coated OT column revealed adequate repeatability concerning run-to-run, day-to-day and column-to-column. These results demonstrated the promising applicability of nano-ABDMPC-silica hybrid sol coated OT column in CEC enantioseparations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

In this study, a novel GQDs bonded silica stationary phase was prepared and applied in multiple separation modes including normal phase, reversed phase and hydrophilic chromatography mode. Alkaloids, nucleosides and nucleobases were chosen as test compounds to evaluate the separation performance of this column in hydrophilic chromatographic mode. The tested polar compounds achieved baseline separation and the resolutions reached 2.32, 4.62, 7.79, 1.68 for thymidine, uridine, adenosine, cytidine and guanosine. This new column showed satisfactory chromatographic performance for anilines, phenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in normal and reversed phase mode. Five anilines were completely separated within 10min under the condition of mobile phase containing only 10% methanol. The effect of water content, buffer concentration and pH on chromatographic separation was further investigated, founding that this new stationary phase showed a complex retention mechanism of partitioning, adsorption and electrostatic interaction in hydrophilic chromatography mode, and the multiple retention interactions such as \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and \u03c0-\u03c0 electron-donor-acceptor interaction played an important role during the separation process.

In this study, a novel octadecyl modified GQDs-bonded silica (C/GQDs/SiO) stationary phase was prepared and applied in reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. This column showed satisfactory separation performance for both hydrophobic, polar and hydrophilic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylbenzenes, anilines, phenols, aromatic acids, alkaloids, nucleosides and nucleobases. Through investigating the impact of organic solvent content on retention, it was found this new stationary phase had typical characteristics of hydrophobic/hydrophilic chromatography. Compared with commercial C column, this column showed better separation performance for polar aromatic compounds because the introduction of GQDs provided more interactions such as \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, hydrophilic and hydrogen bonding interaction with analytes. To get an in-depth understanding of the retention mechanism, linear solvation energy relationship model was established for both C/GQDs/SiO and C columns, theoretically calculated data indicated that C/GQDs/SiO column had higher \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen-bonding acceptance ability. C/GQDs composite stationary phase equipped with hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties has great prospect in separation science.",

        "abstract": "Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which can form hydrophobic, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, hydrogen bond and hydrophilic interactions with analytes, are a type of multifunctional separation materials. GQD-based stationary phases have great prospects in HPLC. In this study, 1-aminoethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ionic liquids (ILs) were chosen as functional molecules to improve the chromatographic performance of GQD-bonded silica stationary phase. This new phase could be applied in multiple separation modes including normal phase, reverse phase, ionic exchange and hydrophilic chromatography modes. Anilines, phenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were efficiently separated on the IL/GQD/SiO2 column within 10 minutes in the normal phase and reverse phase modes. Five inorganic anions were baseline separated in the ionic exchange mode. Hydrophilic compounds including alkaloids, glycosides, amino acids and aromatic acids achieved satisfactory resolutions on this stationary phase in the hydrophilic chromatography mode. The separation performance of the IL/GQD/SiO2 column was compared to those of GQD/SiO2 column and IL/SiO2 column; it was found that the IL/GQD/SiO2 column showed better separation performance than the other two columns, which indicated ILs and GQDs had certain synergistic and complementary effects. Introduction of ILs enhanced the separation performance of the GQD-based phase, especially for acid compounds. By investigating the effects of buffer pH, buffer concentration and water content in the mobile phase, it was found that the electrostatic adsorption retention mechanism played a major role in the hydrophilic chromatography mode. This stationary phase, which allows the selection of appropriate separation modes on the basis of analytes, possesses practical prospects after further improvement.",

        "abstract": "Graphene quantum dots (GQD) functionalized \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) and cellulose silica composites were first prepared and applied in HPLC as chiral stationary phases (CSP) to investigate the effect of GQDs on chiral separation. Through comparing the enantioseparation performance of GQDs functionalized \u03b2-CD or cellulose CSPs and unmodified \u03b2-CD or cellulose CSPs, we found GQDs enhanced the enantioseparation performance of nature \u03b2-CD, \u03b2-CD-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate derivative and cellulose-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate derivative. Molecular modeling was applied to understand and theoretically study the enhancement mechanism of GQDs for enantioseparation. According to molecular simulation results, GQDs provide extra interactions such as hydrophobic, hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction when chiral selector interacts with enantiomers, which enhances the chiral recognition ability indirectly. The molecular simulation results showed a good agreement with the experimental results. Our work reveals the enhancement performance of GQDs for chiral separation, it can be expected that GQDs-based chiral composites and chiral GQDs have great prospect in chiral separation and other research fields such as asymmetric synthesis, chiral catalysis, chiral recognition and drug delivery.",

NCC was further reacted with 3,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate to obtain the nanocellulose derivative, and then coated successfully on the surface of silica gel to a prepared NCC-coated chiral stationary phase (CSP) as a new kind of chiral separation material. Similarly, MCC derivative-coated CSP was also prepared as contrast. The chiral separation performance of NCC-based CSP was evaluated and compared with MCC-based CSP by high-performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, the effects of the alcohol modifiers, mobile phase additives, and flow rates on chiral separations were investigated in detail. The results showed that 10 chiral compounds were separated on NCC-based CSP with better peak shape and higher column efficiency than MCC-based CSP, which confirmed that NCC-based CSP was a promising packing material for the resolution of chiral compounds.Chirality 28:376-381, 2016. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

COFs have attractive properties such as highly tunable porosity, ordered channels, optional building blocks, predictable control of structures, easy to functionalize. Until now, COFs have attracted increasing attention from researchers due to their versatile applications in analytical chemistry. This review provides a comprehensive overview covering COFs and their applications as materials in separation (solid-phase extraction, membrane separation and chromatographic separation) and their roles in analysis (chemical sensing, spectral detection and visual detection). Moreover, we discuss the interaction principles between COFs and target compounds. This review also discusses improvements in performance of COFs over conventional materials when they are used in analytical chemistry. Lastly, we discuss current challenges and possible trends for applications of COFs in analytical chemistry.",

Powder X-ray diffraction, solid nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning electron microscope confirmed the successful preparation of COF-300@SiO 2  chromatographic stationary phase. Multimode chromatographic performance and multiple retention mechanisms were investigated. Neutral and polar compounds were efficiently separated in reverse phase chromatography mode due to hydrophobic interaction, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, electron-donor-acceptor interaction and size selectivity of porous structure, and the column exhibited comparable hydrophobic selectivity with C18 column. Especially, the size selectivity of porous structure promoted the separation of multicomponent compounds on the novel column. Only neutral compounds were completely or partly separated in normal phase chromatography mode based on \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, and the column showed better separation performance than SiO 2  column. Moreover, the column also presented weaker hydrophilic interaction than NH 2 /SiO 2  column in hydrophilic phase chromatography mode. Nucleosides, nucleobases and alkaloids were partly or completely separated on the developed column because of the presence of amino groups on the surface of COF-300. This work indicates promising application values of COFs-based chromatographic stationary phases in chromatographic separation areas.",

        "abstract": "A novel high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) multifunctional immobilized chiral stationary phase was prepared by bonding dialdehyde microcrystalline cellulose to aminosilica via Schiff base reaction and then derivatized with 3,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate. The HPLC multifunctional immobilized chiral stationary phase could not only achieve chiral separation but also achieve achiral separation. Chiral separation evaluation showed that 1-(1-naphthyl)ethanol and mandelonitrile got separation in normal phase (NP) mode. Ranolazine, benzoin ethyl ether, metalaxyl, and diclofop were successfully separated in reversed phase (RP) mode. Aromatic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), anilines, and aromatic acids were selected as analytes to investigate the achiral separation performance of the multifunctional immobilized chiral stationary phase in NP and RP modes. The achiral separation evaluation showed that six PAHs could get good separation within 10\u00a0minutes in NP mode. Four aromatic acids were well separated in RP mode. The retention mechanism of aromatic compounds on the stationary phase was discussed, founding that \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, \u03c0-\u03c0 electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interaction, and hydrogen bonding interaction played important roles during the achiral separation process. This multifunctional immobilized chiral stationary phase had the advantages of simple bonding steps, short reaction time, and no need for space arm.",

        "abstract": "The accumulation of NH in response to Fe deficiency plays a role not only in the remobilization of Fe from the root cell wall, but also in the transportation of Fe from root to shoot. Ammonium (NH) plays an important role in phosphorus-deficiency responses in rice, but its role in responses to Fe deficiency remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the accumulation of NH plays a pivotal role when Arabidopsis thaliana plants are subject to Fe deficiency. The Arabidopsis amt1-3 mutant, which is defective in endogenous NH sensing, exhibited increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency compared to WT (wild type; Col-0). In addition, exogenous application of NH significantly alleviated Fe deficiency symptoms in plants. NH triggers the production of nitric oxide (NO), which then induces ferric-chelate reductase (FCR) activity and accelerates the release of Fe from the cell wall, especially hemicellulose, thereby increasing the availability of soluble Fe in roots. NH also increases soluble Fe levels in shoots by upregulating genes involved in Fe translocation, such as FRD3 (FERRIC REDUCTASE DEFECTIVE3) and NAS1 (NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE1), hence, alleviating leaf chlorosis. Overall, NH plays an important role in the reutilization of Fe from the cell wall and the redistribution of Fe from root to shoot in Fe-deficient Arabidopsis, a process dependent on NO accumulation.",

Using this strategy, 5-aminotetrazole-1-propionic acid (Hatzp) was selected to react with praseodymium(III) nitrate or perchlorate in the same solvent system, producing two different coordination compounds, [Pr2(atzp)4(H2O)8]\u00b72NO3\u00b72H2O (1) and [Pr2(atzp)6(H2O)2]\u00b7H2O (2). These compounds were structurally characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compound 1 displays a dinuclear structure, whereas 2 shows a one dimensional zigzag chain framework. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of compounds 1 and 2 were investigated at room temperature in the solid state.",

        "abstract": "6-Gingerol (6-G) is known to alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of 6-G myocardial protection are not known. In this study, the protective effect of 6-G on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage and whether such a mechanism was related to apoptosis inhibition and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signaling pathway were investigated. Rats were subjected to I/R in the presence or absence of 6-G and the changes of cardiac function, infarct size and histopathological changes, and the levels of cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase-MB, and myocardial apoptosis were examined. The expression of caspase-3, PI3K, p-Akt, and Akt was also determined. We found that 6-G (6\u2009mg/kg) pretreatment significantly improved heart function and ameliorated infarct size and histopathological changes and cardiac troponin T and creatine kinase-MB levels induced by I/R. Moreover, pretreatment with 6-G significantly inhibited myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3 activation induced by I/R. 6-G also upregulated expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and Akt in myocardial tissues. Taken together, these findings suggest that 6-G inhibits apoptosis and activates PI3K/Akt signaling in response to myocardial I/R injury as a possible mechanism to attenuate I/R-induced injury in heart. These results might be important for developing novel strategies for preventing myocardial I/R injury.",

        "abstract": "We extracted the primary pulmonary fibroblasts of the normal and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice and investigated the functioning mechanism of citrus alkaline extract (CAE) in the induction of pulmonary fibroblast apoptosis. The expression intensity of vimentin of the pulmonary fibroblasts in the model mice was higher than that in the normal mice. Meanwhile, the positive expression rate and expression intensity of alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA) of the pulmonary fibroblasts in the model mice were higher than those in the normal mice. Results of MTT showed that pulmonary fibroblast activity of the normal and model mice has been significantly inhibited by CAE in a concentration-dependent manner. The results of flow cytometer analysis showed that the proportion of pulmonary fibroblast apoptosis in the model mice has been profoundly increased by CAE treatment in a dosage-dependent manner. Besides we found that the expression of Cleaved-Caspase 3, Cleaved-Caspase 8, Cleaved-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (Cleaved-PARP), and Fas and Fas Ligand (FasL) was markedly increased after CAE treatment. A further study showed that the expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E receptor 2 (EP2) was dependant on the concentration of CAE, indicating that CAE-regulated receptor apoptosis of Fas was probably related to COX-2. The results of fluorescence detection of oxidative stress showed that the level of oxidative stress was significantly increased after CAE treatment. Furthermore, the results of Western Blot showed that the phosphorylation level of p38 (p-p38) was markedly increased, suggesting that CAE probably has regulated COX-2 through increased p-p38 following oxidative stress. Our results therefore suggest that CAE can effectively induce pulmonary fibroblast apoptosis of the normal and model mice, and its functioning mechanism is probably related to the p38/COX-2/Fas signaling pathway regulated by oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "Neurons that co-express agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are indispensable for normal feeding behavior. Firing activities of AgRP/NPY neurons are dynamically regulated by energy status and coordinate appropriate feeding behavior to meet nutritional demands. However, intrinsic mechanisms that regulate AgRP/NPY neural activities during the fed-to-fasted transition are not fully understood. We found that AgRP/NPY neurons in satiated mice express high levels of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3 (SK3) and are inhibited by SK3-mediated potassium currents; on the other hand, food deprivation suppresses SK3 expression in AgRP/NPY neurons, and the decreased SK3-mediated currents contribute to fasting-induced activation of these neurons. Genetic mutation of SK3 specifically in AgRP/NPY neurons leads to increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity, associated with chronic hyperphagia and decreased energy expenditure. Our results identify SK3 as a key intrinsic mediator that coordinates nutritional status with AgRP/NPY neural activities and animals' feeding behavior and energy metabolism.",

Here we show that the female mice have more pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus than males, and female POMC neurons display higher neural activities, compared to male counterparts. Strikingly, deletion of the transcription factor, TAp63, in POMC neurons confers \"male-like\" diet-induced obesity (DIO) in female mice associated with decreased POMC neural activities; but the same deletion does not affect male mice. Our results indicate that TAp63 in female POMC neurons contributes to the enhanced POMC neuron functions and resistance to obesity in females. Thus, TAp63 in POMC neurons is one key molecular driver for the sexual dimorphism in energy homeostasis.",

We show that mice with DAD knock-in mutations have memory deficits, reduced anxiety levels, and reduced social interactions. Mice with NCOR1 and NORC2 depletion specifically in GABAergic neurons (NS-V mice) recapitulated the memory deficits and had reduced GABA receptor subunit \u03b12 (GABRA2) expression in lateral hypothalamus GABAergic (LH) neurons. This was associated with LH neuron hyperexcitability and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, through a monosynaptic LH to CA3 projection. Optogenetic activation of this projection caused memory deficits, whereas targeted manipulation of LH or CA3 neuron activity reversed memory deficits in NS-V mice. We describe de novo variants in NCOR1, NCOR2 or HDAC3 in patients with intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings identify a hypothalamus-hippocampus projection that may link endocrine signals with synaptic plasticity through NCOR-mediated regulation of GABA signaling.",

Here we show that the female mice have more pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus than males, and female POMC neurons display higher neural activities, compared to male counterparts. Strikingly, deletion of the transcription factor, TAp63, in POMC neurons confers \"male-like\" diet-induced obesity (DIO) in female mice associated with decreased POMC neural activities; but the same deletion does not affect male mice. Our results indicate that TAp63 in female POMC neurons contributes to the enhanced POMC neuron functions and resistance to obesity in females. Thus, TAp63 in POMC neurons is one key molecular driver for the sexual dimorphism in energy homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal lung disease with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The incidence of IPF increases with age, and the mechanisms related to aging such as cellular senescence have been strongly implicated in disease pathology. Therefore, a better understanding of fibroblasts senescence might provide a new therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of citrus alkaline extracts (CAE) on the fibroblasts senescence, and elucidate the underlying mechanism to ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis. We demonstrated that CAE mitigated the collagen deposition by the initial early treatment, suggesting a potential preventive effect of CAE on pulmonary fibrosis. The expression of senescence biomarkers P16 and P21, concomitant with down-regulation of the myofibroblasts marker \u03b1-SMA, and the number of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) positive cells were decreased by CAE treatment, indicating a significant inhibitory effect of CAE on fibroblast senescence. Additionally, CAE down-regulated the expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in etoposide-induced senescent fibroblasts. Further studies indicated that COX-2 activation was required for CAE to inhibit the lung fibroblast senescence through a P53-dependent pathway. Results showed that the anti-senescence effect of CAE was abrogated when COX-2 was knocked down or inhibited by COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or indomethacin in lung fibroblasts. Meanwhile, the anti-fibrotic and anti-senescence effect of CAE were abolished due to disruption of COX-2 in vivo. Collectively, our results provided a novel insight into the potential mechanism of CAE to inhibit the fibroblasts activation through preventing cellular senescence.",

A manual search in relevant journals and of relevant literature on other websites was also performed. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. The PROSPERO ID was CRD42018086377. Results. A total of 19 RCTs were included. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the DCVB6 injection combined with chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone regarding objective response rate (RR=1.58, 95% CI 1.40-1.79), Karnofsky performance score (RR=1.68, 95% CI 1.42-1.99), clinical symptom (RR=1.68, 95% CI 1.44-1.96), white blood cell toxicity (RR=0.36, 95% CI 0.27-0.49), platelet toxicity (RR=0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.63), and vomiting (RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.37-0.67). Conclusions. The current evidence suggests that DCVB6 injection combined with chemotherapy could increase objective response rate and Karnofsky performance score, improve clinical symptoms, and reduce side effects caused by chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. However, these results should be carefully interpreted due to the low-quality methodology and the small sample sizes of the trials, and our conclusions should be verified by high-quality, large-scale, double-blinded RCTs.",

        "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal lung disease with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. -acetylcysteine (NAC), an anti-oxidant drug, has promising potential in the treatment of IPF. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, the efficacy and safety of NAC for IPF were investigated. The following databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies published until August 2018: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wangfang Database, VIP and the Chinese Biology Medical Database. A total of 21 controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of NAC therapy for IPF were identified and primary outcomes [forced vital capacity (FVC), adverse side effects] and secondary outcomes [diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and its percentage predicted value (DLCO%), vital capacity (VC), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO), 6-min walking distance test and mortality] were extracted for the meta-analysis. The risk ratio and mean difference or standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval were calculated using RevMan 5.3 software. Analysis of the pooled data revealed that, compared with control treatments (routine treatment or drugs other than anti-oxidants), NAC therapy reduced the decline in lung function, as indicated by the FVC and DLCO, and slowed the progression of the disease, as indicated by the PaO, while complications and mortality were similar. These results suggest good efficacy, tolerability and safety of the treatment. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that combined therapy including NAC for IPF might be more effective than NAC monotherapy, while oral administration of NAC was safer than inhalation. In conclusion, the results of the present review and meta-analysis provide important information that may serve as a guide regarding NAC therapy for IPF in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Neurons expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP), the so-called hunger neurons, protect mammals from starvation by promoting food-seeking behaviors (Trends Neurosci 36:504-512, 2013). Now an increasing amount of evidence show that these hunger-sensing neurons not only motivate animals to forage and ingest food but also help conserve energy by inhibiting innate processes that demand large amounts of energy such as growth, reproduction, and stress response. It has further been perceived that AgRP neurons transmit signals with negative valence to reward and cognitive centers so as to engage the motivational behavior toward seeking and obtaining foods (Physiol Behav 190:34-42, 2017). Recent advancement in genome editing and neurotechniques unleashed an escalated research of uniquely defined neuronal populations and neural circuits underlying the behavioral regulation of body weight and food responses (Nat Biotechnol 32:347-355, 2014; Proc Natl Acad Sci 113, 2016). In this chapter we will review literatures describing the functional organization of the AgRP circuit and its correlative signaling components that influence ingestive, foraging, motivational, and cognitive responses, a framework that reshaped our thinking toward the new hope and challenges in treatment of obesity and eating disorders.",

        "abstract": "The current epidemic of obesity and its associated metabolic syndromes imposes unprecedented challenges to our society. Despite intensive research focus on obesity pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic strategy to treat and cure obesity is still lacking. The obesity development is due to a disturbed homeostatic control of feeding and energy expenditure, both of which are controlled by an intricate neural network in the brain. Given the inherent complexity of brain networks in controlling feeding and energy expenditure, the understanding of brain-based pathophysiology for obesity development is limited. One key limiting factor in dissecting neural pathways for feeding and energy expenditure is unavailability of techniques that can be used to effectively reduce the complexity of the brain network to a tractable paradigm, based on which a strong hypothesis can be tested. Excitingly, emerging techniques have been involved to be able to link specific groups of neurons and neural pathways to behaviors (i.e., feeding and energy expenditure). In this chapter, novel techniques especially those based on animal models and viral vector approaches will be discussed. We hope that this chapter will provide readers with a basis that can help to understand the literatures using these techniques and with a guide to apply these exciting techniques to investigate brain mechanisms underlying feeding and energy expenditure.",

        "title": "Deciphering a GABAergic Neural Circuit in Critical Control of Leptin-Mediated Feeding, Body Weight, and Glucose Homeostasis",
        "abstract": "Leptin plays a major role in control of glucose metabolism and feeding behavior by acting upon the LepR neurons that widely distribute through the brain. Although several LepR-expressing neuronal groups were identified in distinct nuclei, a dominant neural circuit that mediates the physiological roles of leptin remains elusive, largely due to the inadequate phenotypes as a result of developmental and neural compensations. In this report, a novel, non-sense suppression-based, inducible genetic system is implemented to rapidly delete a specific group of LepR signaling from adult mice within 4 days. Acute deletion of LepR from AgRP neurons show a drastic increase of food intake, massive weight gain, and severe glucose intolerance, developing in a rate with tight manifestation of the global leptin deficiency. Furthermore, a neural circuit comprising of LepR-expressing AgRP neurons and downstream GABAergic neurons in the DMH is mapped by genetic and functional tracing approaches. Optogenetic manipulation of AgRP LepR -DMH GABA  neural circuit or the post-synaptic DMH MC4R  neurons strongly altered food intake and glucose tolerance in a bidirectional controlled manner. Among all GABA A  subunits examined, Gabra3 (encoding GABA A  \u03b13 subunits) displayed the most robust changes in response to genetic inactivation of LepR AgRP  signaling. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique, loss of Gabra3 in DMH MC4R  neurons reduced food intake and enhanced glucose intolerance. Surprisingly, chronic infusion of bicuculline into the DMH fully reversed the obesity and glucose intolerance as a result of acute deletion of LepR AgRP  signaling. Furthermore, genetic ablation of GABA DMH  neurons blunted leptin-mediated control of glucose metabolism and food intake.  In conclusion, we unveil a novel AgRP LepR -DMH GABA  neural circuit and associated GABA A  receptor signaling system in fundamental control of leptin-associated obesity and diabetes.

        "abstract": "A body of revolution, finite-difference time-domain (BOR-FDTD) method is developed for rigorous analysis of axisymmetric transformation optics (TO) lens devices. For normal incidence, a one dimensional (1-D) FDTD method based on the total-field scattered-field (TFSF) technique was proposed to model the propagation of a plane wave launched from the top of a layered medium in cylindrical coordinates. The 1-D FDTD solutions were employed to efficiently inject normally incident plane waves into the BOR-FDTD method. For oblique incidence, analytical formulations were derived and presented by expanding the plane wave into a series of cylindrical modes via Fourier series expansion of the f-dependent variables, which were then used to introduce obliquely incident plane waves into the TFSF formulas associated with the BOR-FDTD method. These procedures allowed for accurate simulations of BOR TO lenses embedded in layered media illuminated by obliquely incident waves. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method were verified by comparing numerical results with either analytical solutions or a commercial software (COMSOL) package. Thereafter, the developed BOR-FDTD code was utilized to study the imaging properties of (a) radial gradient-index (GRIN) lenses with a parabolic index profile, (b) a flat TO GRIN lens, (c) a spherical Luneburg lens, and (d) a cylindrical TO Luneburg lens both in free space and on top of a substrate. Here the TO GRIN lenses were designed by using the quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO) technique. It was found that the flat TO lens was able to provide identical focusing properties as a cemented doublet in both free space and over a dielectric substrate. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrated that the flattened TO Luneburg lens possessed the desired imaging properties under different illuminations for both polarizations.",

        "abstract": "Metasurfaces and metamaterials have been explored extensively in recent years for their ability to enable a variety of innovative microwave devices. However, because their exotic properties often arise from resonant structures, the large field enhancements under high-power microwave illumination can lead to dielectric breakdown and damage to the device. In order to develop metasurfaces and metamaterials capable of being utilized in high-power microwave applications, this paper investigates techniques for reducing the maximum field enhancement factor (MFEF) in several types of structures from the literature. Starting with a simple Sievenpiper metasurface, this paper evaluates the dependence of MFEF on the structure design parameters. For more complex metasurface geometries, a genetic algorithm is demonstrated that can evolve structures that have minimal MFEF. In addition, negative-index and low-index metamaterials are evaluated for field enhancement. By optimizing for low loss and by operating in the resonance tails, metamaterials with low MFEF can be realized for high-power applications. To illustrate this, a quad-beam focusing metamaterial lens is presented with an MFEF less than 5 over the entire operating band.",

        "abstract": "A high-gain reduced-profile antenna is designed by combining the effects of a near-zero-index volumetric metamaterial lens and an artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) ground plane. The AMC/metalens antenna design presented here has 20% reduced height over an equivalent metalens antenna with conventional metallic ground plane at the cost of reduced peak directivity and pattern bandwidth. Both the metamaterial unit cells and the mushroom-type AMC structure are designed independently and retuned in the presence of the other for optimal performance. The lens collimates the electromagnetic radiation of a dipole feed by refraction as well as via a Fabry-Perot cavity effect, with resulting gain and patterns that are better than either mechanism can achieve individually. Full wave simulations of the entire metamaterial and AMC structure with a feed dipole agree well with measurements of the fabricated design.",

        "abstract": "Metamaterials have been used in many different configurations to enhance the radiation properties of antennas. However, the vast majority of these metamaterial applications only consider linearly polarized antennas. This paper discusses the theory, design, implementation, and measurements of a far-field collimating lens for use with a circularly-polarized crossed-dipole antenna constructed from a 3D-volumetric metamaterial slab. Zero-index materials (ZIM) and low-index materials (LIM) cause the magnitude and phase of the radiated field across the face of the lens to be distributed uniformly, increasing the broadside gain over the feed antenna alone. Full-wave simulations were used in design of the lens, and a prototype metamaterial lens (meta-lens) was constructed and measured to verify the theoretical predictions. The meta-lens was found to increase the measured directivity of a crossed-dipole feed antenna by more than 6 dB, in good agreement with numerical simulations.",

The results revealed that plant growth, CO2 assimilation rate and chlorophyll content were significantly reduced in the seedlings grown under red, blue, yellow and green lights as compared with those grown under white light, but each monochromatic light played its special role in regulating plant morphogenesis and photosynthesis. Seedling leaves were thickened and slightly curled; Rubisco biosynthesis, expression of the rca, rbcS and rbcL, the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and quantum yield of PSII electron transport (\u0424PSII) were all increased in seedlings grown under blue light as compared with those grown under white light. Furthermore, the photosynthetic rate of seedlings grown under blue light was significantly increased, and leaf number and chlorophyll content of seedlings grown under red light were increased as compared with those exposed to other monochromatic lights. On the contrary, the seedlings grown under yellow and green lights were dwarf with the new leaves etiolated. Moreover, photosynthesis, Rubisco biosynthesis and relative gene expression were greatly decreased in seedlings grown under yellow and green light, but chloroplast structural features were less influenced. Interestingly, the Fv/Fm, \u0424PSII value and chlorophyll content of the seedlings grown under green light were much higher than those grown under yellow light.",

        "abstract": "To investigate how light quality influences tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L) seedlings, we examined changes in plant growth, chloroplast ultrastructure, photosynthetic parameters and some photosynthesis-related genes expression levels. For this, tomato plants were grown under different light qualities with the same photosynthetic photon flux density: red (R), blue (B), yellow (Y), green (G) and white (W) lights. Our results revealed that, compared with plants grown under W light, the growth of plants grown under monochromatic lights was inhibited with the growth reduction being more significant in the plants grown under Y and G lights. However, the monochromatic lights had their own effects on the growth and photosynthetic function of tomato seedlings. The plant height was reduced under blue light, but expression of rbcS, rbcL, psbA, psbB genes was up-regulated, and the \u03a6PSII and electron transport rate (ETR) values were enhanced. More starch grains were accumulated in chloroplasts. The root elongation, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), NPQ and rbcS and psbA genes expression were promoted under red light. Yellow light- and green light-illuminated plants grew badly with their lower Rubisco content and Pn value observed, and less starch grains accumulated in chloroplast. However, less influence was noted of light quality on chloroplast structure. Compared with yellow light, the values of \u03a6PSII, ETR, qP and NPQ of plants exposed to green light were significantly increased, suggesting that green light was beneficial to both the development of photosynthetic apparatus to some extent.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen gas (H2) was recently proposed as a therapeutic antioxidant and signaling molecule in clinical trials. However, the underlying physiological roles of H2 in plants remain unclear. In the present study, hydrogen-rich water (HRW) was used to characterize the physiological roles of H2 in enhancing the tolerance of Brassica campestris against cadmium (Cd). The results showed that both 50 \u03bcM CdCl2 and 50%-saturated HRW induced an increase of endogenous H2 in Brassica campestris seedlings, and HRW alleviated Cd toxicity related to growth inhibition and oxidative damage. Seedlings supplied with HRW exhibited increased root length and reduced lipid peroxidation, similar to plants receiving GSH post-treatment. Additionally, seedlings post-treated with HRW accumulated higher levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AsA) and showed increased GST and GPX activities in roots. Molecular evidence illustrated that the expression of genes such as GS, GR1 and GR2, which were down-regulated following the addition of Cd, GSH or BSO, could be reversed to varying degrees by the addition of HRW. Based on these results, it could be proposed that H2 might be an important regulator for enhancing the tolerance of Brassica campestris seedlings against Cd, mainly by governing reduced glutathione homeostasis.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen gas (H) has been shown as an important factor in plant tolerance to abiotic stresses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of H and its interaction with nitric oxide (NO) on alleviating cadmium (Cd) stress in Brassica campestris seedlings were investigated. NO donor (SNP) or hydrogen-rich water (HRW) treatment showed a significant improvement in growth of Cd-stressed seedlings. Cd treatment upregulated both endogenous NO and H (36% and 66%, respectively), and the increase of H was prior to NO increase. When treated with NO scavenger (PTIO) or NO biosynthesis enzyme inhibitors (L-NAME and Gln), HRW-induced alleviation under Cd stress was prevented. Under Cd stress, HRW pretreatment significantly enhanced the NO accumulation, and together up-regulated the activity of NR (nitrate reductase) and expression of NR. HRW induced lower reactive oxygen species (ROS), higher AsA content, enhanced activity of POD (peroxidase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase) in seedling roots were inhibited by PTIO, L-NAME and Gln. Through proteomic analysis, the level of 29 proteins were changed in response to H and NO-induced amelioration of Cd stress. Nearly half of them were involved in oxidation-reduction processes (about 20%) or antioxidant enzymes (approximately 20%). These results strongly indicate that in Cd-stressed seedlings, pretreatment with HRW induces the accumulation of H (biosynthesized or permeated), which further stimulates the biosynthesis of NO through the NR pathway. Finally, H and NO together enhance the antioxidant capabilities of seedlings in response to Cd toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Effects of nitrogen (N) deficiency and sucrose (Suc) addition on regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and their relationship were investigated in this study. Radish sprouts subjected to N deficiency had 50% higher anthocyanin accumulation than when grown in Hoagland solution (a nutrient medium with all macronutrients). The contents of endogenous soluble sugars (Suc, fructose, and glucose) in the hypocotyls were also markedly increased by N limitation, with Suc showing the highest increase. Inhibition of carbohydrate biosynthesis by addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) also eliminated N deficiency-induced anthocyanin accumulation. The latter was further supported by the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes and decreased activities of nitrate reductase in the presence of Suc. Together our results indicate that N deficiency-induced anthocyanin accumulation was, at least partly, dependent on the increase of the soluble sugar, especially Suc. This work is the first comprehensive study on relationship between N deficiency and sugar content on anthocyanin accumulation in the hypocotyls of radish sprouts.",

        "abstract": "The progress in plant breeding for salinity stress tolerance is handicapped by the lack of understanding of the specificity of salt stress signalling and adaptation at the cellular and tissue levels. In this study, we used electrophysiological, fluorescence imaging, and real-time quantitative PCR tools to elucidate the essentiality of the cytosolic Na+ extrusion in functionally different root zones (elongation, meristem, and mature) in a large number of bread and durum wheat accessions. We show that the difference in the root's ability for vacuolar Na+ sequestration in the mature zone may explain differential salinity stress tolerance between salt-sensitive durum and salt-tolerant bread wheat species. Bread wheat genotypes also had on average 30% higher capacity for net Na+ efflux from the root elongation zone, providing the first direct evidence for the essentiality of the root salt exclusion trait at the cellular level. At the same time, cytosolic Na+ accumulation in the root meristem was significantly higher in bread wheat, leading to the suggestion that this tissue may harbour a putative salt sensor. This hypothesis was then tested by investigating patterns of Na+ distribution and the relative expression level of several key genes related to Na+ transport in leaves in plants with intact roots and in those in which the root meristems were removed. We show that tampering with this sensing mechanism has resulted in a salt-sensitive phenotype, largely due to compromising the plant's ability to sequester Na+ in mesophyll cell vacuoles. The implications of these findings for plant breeding for salinity stress tolerance are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Soil salinity remains a major threat to global food security, and the progress in crop breeding for salinity stress tolerance may be achieved only by pyramiding key traits mediating plant adaptive responses to high amounts of dissolved salts in the rhizosphere. This task may be facilitated by studying natural variation in salinity tolerance among plant species and, specifically, exploring mechanisms of salinity tolerance in halophytes. The aim of this work was to establish the causal link between mesophyll ion transport activity and plant salt tolerance in a range of evolutionary contrasting halophyte and glycophyte species. Plants were grown under saline conditions in a glasshouse, followed by assessing their growth and photosynthetic performance. In a parallel set of experiments, net K and H transport across leaf mesophyll and their modulation by light were studied in control and salt-treated mesophyll segments using vibrating non-invasive ion selective microelectrode (the MIFE) technique. The reported results show that mesophyll cells in glycophyte species loses 2-6 fold more K compared with their halophyte counterparts. This decline was reflected in a reduced maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, chlorophyll content and growth observed in the glasshouse experiments. In addition to reduced K efflux, the more tolerant species also exhibited reduced H efflux, which is interpreted as an energy-saving strategy allowing more resources to be redirected towards plant growth. It is concluded that the ability of mesophyll to retain K without a need to activate plasma membrane H-ATPase is an essential component of salinity tolerance in halophytes and halophytic crop plants.",

        "abstract": "Soil salinity is a major constraint for the global agricultural production. For many decades, Na exclusion from uptake has been the key trait targeted in breeding programs; yet, no major breakthrough in creating salt tolerant germplasm was achieved. In this work, we have combined the MIFE technique for non-invasive ion flux measurements with confocal fluorescence dye imaging technique to screen 45 accessions of barley to reveal the relative contribution of Na exclusion from the cytosol to the apoplast and its vacuolar sequestration in the root apex, for the overall salinity stress tolerance. We show that Na /H antiporter-mediated Na extrusion from the root plays a minor role in the overall salt tolerance in barley. At the same time, a strong and positive correlation was found between root vacuolar Na sequestration ability and the overall salt tolerance. The inability of salt sensitive genotypes to sequester Na in root vacuoles was in a contrast to a significantly higher expression levels of both HvNHX1 tonoplast Na /H antiporters and HvVP1 H -pumps compared with tolerant genotypes. This data is interpreted as a failure of sensitive varieties to prevent Na back-leak into the cytosol and existence of a futile Na cycle at the tonoplast. Taken together, our results demonstrated that root vacuolar Na sequestration but not exclusion from uptake played the main role in barley salinity tolerance and suggested that the focus of the breeding programs should be shifted from targeting genes mediating Na exclusion from uptake by roots to more efficient root vacuolar Na sequestration.

        "abstract": "AIMS: To determine the effectiveness and safety of varenicline in treating tobacco dependence in patients with severe mental illness. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that compared varenicline with a placebo or an alternative intervention for smoking cessation or reduction. SETTING: Both in-patient and out-patient settings in any country. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients aged 18 and over with any type of severe mental illness. The systematic review included eight studies comprising 398 participants. MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were (1) smoking cessation (2) smoking reduction measured by changes in the number of cigarettes smoked per day and (3) number of psychiatric adverse events, which were collected at the end of treatment. FINDINGS: The random-effect pooled estimates from the five studies that reported smoking related outcomes found that varenicline is statistically superior to placebo in smoking cessation (risk ratios 4.33; 95% CI: 1.96-9.56), and smoking reduction was higher in varenicline groups (mean reduced daily cigarettes was 6.39; 95% CI: 2.22-10.56). There is no significant difference regarding neuropsychiatric and other adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline appears to be significantly more effective than placebo in assisting with smoking cessation and reduction in people with severe mental illness. There appears to be no clear evidence that varenicline was associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric or other adverse events compared with placebo. This article is protected by copyright.

        "title": "Start2quit: a randomised clinical controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using personal tailored risk information and taster sessions to increase the uptake of the NHS Stop Smoking Services",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSSs) offer help to smokers who want to quit. However, the proportion of smokers attending the SSSs is low and current figures show a continuing downward trend. This research addressed the problem of how to motivate more smokers to accept help to quit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, of an intervention consisting of proactive recruitment by a brief computer-tailored personal risk letter and an invitation to a u0027Come and Try itu0027 taster session to provide information about the SSSs, compared with a standard generic letter advertising the service, in terms of attendance at the SSSs of at least one session and validated 7-day point prevalent abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention with follow-up 6 months after the date of randomisation. SETTING: SSSs and general practices in England. PARTICIPANTS: All smokers aged \u2265\u200916 years identified from medical records in participating practices who were motivated to quit and who had not attended the SSS in the previous 12 months. Participants were randomised in the ratio 3\u2009:\u20092 (intervention to control) by a computer program. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention - brief personalised and tailored letter sent from the general practitioner using information obtained from the screening questionnaire and from medical records, and an invitation to attend a taster session, run by the local SSS. Control - standard generic letter from the general practice advertising the local SSS and the therapies available, and asking the smoker to contact the service to make an appointment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proportion of people attending the first session of a 6-week course over a period of 6 months from the receipt of the invitation letter, measured by records of attendance at the SSSs; (2) 7-day point prevalent abstinence at the 6-month follow-up, validated by salivary cotinine analysis; and (3) cost-effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: Eighteen SSSs and 99 practices within the SSS areas participated; 4384 participants were randomised to the intervention (n\u2009=\u20092636) or control (n\u2009=\u20091748). One participant withdrew and 4383 were analysed. The proportion of people attending the first session of a SSS course was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group [17.4% vs. 9.0%; unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 2.57; p\u2009 \u200986% over a lifetime horizon. LIMITATIONS: Participating SSSs may not be representative of all SSSs in England. Recruitment was low, at 4%. CONCLUSIONS: The Start2quit trial added to evidence that a proactive approach with an intensive intervention to deliver personalised risk information and offer a no-commitment introductory session can be successful in reaching more smokers and increasing the uptake of the SSS and quit rates. The intervention appears less likely to be cost-effective in the short term, but is highly likely to be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon. FUTURE WORK: Further research could assess the separate effects of these components. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN76561916.

        "abstract": "Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depressed adults. CBT interventions are complex, as they include multiple content components and can be delivered in different ways. We compared the effectiveness of different types of therapy, different components and combinations of components and aspects of delivery used in CBT interventions for adult depression. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in adults with a primary diagnosis of depression, which included a CBT intervention. Outcomes were pooled using a component-level network meta-analysis. Our primary analysis classified interventions according to the type of therapy and delivery mode. We also fitted more advanced models to examine the effectiveness of each content component or combination of components. We included 91 studies and found strong evidence that CBT interventions yielded a larger short-term decrease in depression scores compared to treatment-as-usual, with a standardised difference in mean change of -1.11 (95% credible interval -1.62 to -0.60) for face-to-face CBT, -1.06 (-2.05 to -0.08) for hybrid CBT, and -0.59 (-1.20 to 0.02) for multimedia CBT, whereas wait list control showed a detrimental effect of 0.72 (0.09 to 1.35). We found no evidence of specific effects of any content components or combinations of components. Technology is increasingly used in the context of CBT interventions for depression. Multimedia and hybrid CBT might be as effective as face-to-face CBT, although results need to be interpreted cautiously. The effectiveness of specific combinations of content components and delivery formats remain unclear. Wait list controls should be avoided if possible.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundSmokers who start smoking at an early age are less likely to quit and more likely to die from their habit. Evidence from the US Truth\u00ae campaign suggests that interventions focusing on tobacco industry practices and ethics may be effective in preventing smoking uptake.ObjectivesIn an exploratory study, to develop, pilot and provide preliminary evidence of the acceptability and effectiveness of Operation Smoke Storm, a school-based intervention based on the premise of the Truth\u00ae campaign, to prevent smoking uptake.DesignMixed-methods, non-randomised controlled study. Component 1 was delivered to Year 7 students, and student focus groups and teacher interviews were conducted to refine the lessons and to develop components 2 and 3. The revised Year 7 lessons and accompanying family booklet were delivered to new Year 7 students 1 year later in one school only; Year 8 students in both schools received the booster session.Setting and participantsStudents in Years 7\u20138 (aged 11\u201313 years) in two UK schools.InterventionA three-component intervention comprising (1) three 50-minute classroom-based sessions in Year 7 in which students acted as secret agents to uncover industry practices through videos, quizzes, discussions and presentations; (2) an accompanying family booklet containing activities designed to stimulate discussions about smoking between parents and students; and (3) a 1-hour interactive classroom-based booster session for Year 8 students, in which students learnt about tobacco marketing strategies from the perspectives of an industry executive, a marketing company and a health campaigner.Main outcome measuresOdds ratios to compare the self-reported prevalence of ever smoking and susceptibility to smoking in Year 8 students after the delivery of the booster session in study schools compared with students in local control schools. Qualitative data on acceptability of the intervention.ResultsThe combined prevalence of ever smoking and susceptibility increased from 18.2% in Year 7 to 33.8% in Year 8. After adjusting for confounders there was no significant difference in the odds of a Year 8 student in an intervention school being an ever smoker or susceptible never smoker compared with controls [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.97; p\u2009=\u20090.263] and no significant difference in the odds of ever smoking (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; p\u2009=\u20090.549). Students mostly enjoyed the intervention and acquired new knowledge that appeared to strengthen their aversion to smoking. Teachers liked the \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 nature of the resource, although they highlighted differences by academic ability in the extent to which students understood the messages being presented. Use of the family component was low but it was received positively by those parents who did engage with it.LimitationsLogistical difficulties meant that students\u2019 responses in Year 7 and Year 8 could not be linked; however, baseline smoking behaviours differed little between intervention and control schools, and analyses were adjusted for confounders measured at follow-up.ConclusionsOperation Smoke Storm is an acceptable resource for delivering smoking-prevention education but it does not appear to have reduced smoking and susceptibility.Future workThe lack of a strong signal for potential effectiveness, considered alongside logistical difficulties in recruiting and working with schools, suggests that a fully powered cluster randomised trial of the intervention is not warranted.",

It is the first example of an alkali metal selenite halide in the literature.

The anionic [SeOCl] groups are arranged in the crystal in nearly the same direction, giving rise to a relatively large macroscopic dipole moment, causing the compound to display second harmonic generation (SHG) eight times as strong as that of KDP, measured using the Kurtz-Perry method on powders. First-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to interpret the relationship between the crystal structure and properties.",

They crystallize in the same polar space group (P2 ) with a two-dimensional double-layered framework constructed by [BiF ] and [BiO F ] units connected to each other by four F atoms, in which two [IO ] groups are linked to [BiO F ] unit on the same side. A hanging Bi-F bond of [BiF ] unit is located on the other side via ionic interaction with the layer-inserted alkali metal ions to form three-dimensional structure. The well-ordered alignments of these polar units lead to a very strong second-harmonic generation response of 12 (1), 9.5 (2), and 7.5 (3) times larger than that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate under 1064\u2005nm laser radiation. All of them exhibited a wide energy bandgap over 3.75\u2005eV, suggesting that they will have a high laser damage threshold.",

This paper reports and compares the properties of RbIO3 and RbIO2F2 as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) materials to be used in the mid-IR region. RbIO3 is a known compound, and its powder SHG (second harmonic generation) effect is carefully measured in this work for the first time to be as strong as 20 times that of KDP, and its powders show a high damage threshold (LDT) of 125 MW/cm2. In order to investigate the influence on the properties by partially replacing oxygen with fluorine atoms, the new compound RbIO2F2 is synthesized and characterized. Although it also shows relatively strong powder SHG responses 4 times that of KDP, the LDT value of the powders is improved to 156 MW/cm2.

        "abstract": "The synaptic uptake of choline via the high-affinity, hemicholinium-3-dependent choline transporter (CHT) strongly influences the capacity of cholinergic neurons to sustain acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and release. To advance research on the impact of CHT capacity in humans, we established the presence of the neuronal CHT protein in human T lymphocytes. Next, we demonstrated CHT-mediated choline transport in human T cells. To address the validity of T cell-based choline uptake as a proxy for brain CHT capacity, we isolated T cells from the spleen, and synaptosomes from cortex and striatum, of wild type and CHT-overexpressing mice (CHT-OXP). Choline uptake capacity in T cells from CHT-OXP mice was two-fold higher than in wild type mice, mirroring the impact of CHT over-expression on synaptosomal CHT-mediated choline uptake. Monitoring T lymphocyte CHT protein and activity may be useful for estimating human CNS cholinergic capacity and for testing hypotheses concerning the contribution of CHT and, more generally, ACh signaling in cognition, neuroinflammation and disease.",

        "abstract": "Background: Phase III EXPAND trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of BAF312 (Siponimod) to placebo in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. To determine the mechanisms of disease progression, we examined the immunological and gene expression profile of SPMS enrolled in the study and compared them to other types of MS patients.Objectives: In contrast to SPMS, benign MS (BMS) is diagnosed primarily retrospectively and is weighted towards motor progression, specifically an EDSS \uf0a33 after at least 15 years of disease onset. We tested the hypothesis that SPMS has a different immunological and gene expression profile than benign or relapsing remitting MS (RRMS).Design/Methods: We conducted flow cytometry and mircroarray analysis of 20 SPMS patients at baseline and compared it to matched 7 BMS, 14 RRMS and 6 healthy controls (HC).Results: We found that SPMS has a significantly lower [percnt] of CD4+ T cells (43.1\u00b18.5) compared to BMS (55.2\u00b111.0, P=0.0072). Both RRMS and SPMS have a significantly higher [percnt] (16.2\u00b16.6 and 15.2\u00b17.8) of CD8+ T cells compared with BMS (9.1\u00b11.5, P=0.0227 and 0.0134, respectively). SPMS has higher [percnt] of B cells (7.6\u00b14.1) compared with both HC (4.8\u00b13.6, P=0.0396) and BMS (4.4\u00b11.9, P=0.0289). RRMS and SPMS have significantly lower [percnt] of Th2 (CD3+CD4+CRTH2+) (0.20\u00b10.09, P=0.0002 and 0.38\u00b10.30, P=0.0014, respectively) among CD4+ T cells compared to HC (0.82\u00b10.38). Microarray analysis of PBMC from BMS shows a different gene expression pattern as compared to SPMS.Conclusion: SPMS has a different immunological and gene expression profile than BMS. Future longitudinal studies will allow us to determine immunological and gene expression changes following treatment with BAF312 and the relationship of these changes to disease progression, which ultimately will help us to identify biomarkers of disease progression.

        "abstract": "Background: BG-12 is an oral treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) that reduces levels of peripheral blood lymphocytes. This report focused on changes within the B cell subsets following BG-12-treatment.Design/Methods: Peripheral blood B cells were compared for surface marker expression in RRMS patients prior to initiation of treatment, after 4-6 months, and at more than one year of treatment with BG-12. Production of IL-10 by RRMS patient B cells was also analyzed.Results: Total numbers of peripheral blood B lymphocytes declined after 4-6 months of BG-12 treatment, due to losses in both the CD27+ memory B cells and CD27neg B cell subsets. Some inter-patient variability was observed. In contrast, circulating CD24highCD38high (T2-MZP) B cells increased in percentage in the majority of RRMS patients after 4-6 months and were present in higher numbers in all of the patients after 12 months of treatment. The CD43+CD27+ B-1 B cells also increased at the later time point in most patients but were unchanged at 4-6 months compared to pretreatment levels. Purified B cells from seven of the nine RRMS patients tested after 4-6 months of treatment were able to produce IL-10 following CD40 ligand-stimulation, and the amount corresponded with the combined levels of T2-MZP and B-1 B cells in the sample. None of the RRMS patients in this study have had a relapse while taking BG-12.Conclusions: These data suggest that BG-12 differentially affects B cell subsets in RRMS patients, resulting in increased numbers of circulating B lymphocytes with regulatory capacity.

        "abstract": "Dimethyl fumarate (DMF; trade name Tecfidera) is an oral formulation of the fumaric acid ester that is Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. To better understand the therapeutic effects of Tecfidera and its rare side effect of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal studies by immunophenotyping cells from peripheral blood (particularly T lymphocytes) derived from untreated and 4\u20136 and 18\u201326 mo Tecfidera-treated stable relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients using multiparametric flow cytometry. The absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly decreased and the CD4/CD8 ratio was increased with DMF treatment. The proportions of both effector memory T cells and central memory T cells were reduced, whereas naive T cells increased in treated patients. T cell activation was reduced with DMF treatment, especially among effector memory T cells and effector memory RA T cells. Th subsets Th1 (CXCR3 + ), Th17 (CCR6 + ), and particularly those expressing both CXCR3 and CD161 were reduced most significantly, whereas the anti-inflammatory Th2 subset (CCR3 + ) was increased after DMF treatment. A corresponding increase in IL-4 and decrease in IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17\u2013expressing CD4 +  T cells were observed in DMF-treated patients. DMF in vitro treatment also led to increased T cell apoptosis and decreased activation, proliferation, reactive oxygen species, and CCR7 expression. Our results suggest that DMF acts on specific memory and effector T cell subsets by limiting their survival, proliferation, activation, and cytokine production. Monitoring these subsets could help to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DMF treatment.",

        "abstract": "Microbial metabolites, produced in the intestine, have significant effects on inflammatory diseases throughout the body. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have protective effects on experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) responses but the detailed roles of SCFAs and their receptors in regulating autoimmune CNS inflammation have been unclear. SCFAs metabolically regulate T cells and change the phenotype of antigen presenting cells to efficiently induce IL-10 regulatory T cells. In line with the overall protective effect, blood levels of major SCFAs, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, are significantly decreased in long-term active progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Importantly, SCFAs can induce CD4 effector T cells, which are highly inflammatory when transferred into mice, suggesting that the direct effect of SCFAs on T cells can even be pro-inflammatory in the CNS. In contrast to the moderate protective effect of SCFAs, mice deficient in GPR41 or GPR43 are more resistant to EAE pathogenesis. Thus, despite the overall protective function of SCFAs, SCFAs and their receptors have the potential to regulate autoimmune CNS inflammation both positively and negatively.",

        "title": "Discharge characteristics of a radio-frequency capacitively coupled Ar/O2 glow discharge at atmospheric pressure",
        "abstract": "In this study, the discharge characteristics of the developed atmospheric pressure homogeneous and cold plasma source in Ar/O 2 glow discharge driven by radio-frequency (13.56 MHz) are investigated experimentally by means of electric measurements. The electron density is estimated to be in the order of 10 11 cm \u2212 3 in the abnormal discharge regime and is reduced by half in amount when the oxygen is mixed into argon plasma at oxygen-to-argon ratio of 0.3 and 0.6 vol.% at the same input power. The estimated electron temperature assumes the value of 1.4 eV in the abnormal discharge regime and the addition of oxygen to the argon plasma at the oxygen-to-argon ratio smaller than 1.0 vol.% does not alter the electron temperature appreciably. Keywords Glow discharge Atmospheric pressure Radio-frequency 1 Introduction Nonequilibrium oxygen plasmas have a variety of applications, such as etching, cleaning, sterilization, and thin film deposition. In this regard, most works are carried out in vacuum environment containing several tenths to several Torrs of oxygen gas [1] . One of alternative solutions to generate oxygen plasmas is an atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD) at open environment with the rare gas, such as He or Ar, diluted with O 2 [2\u20139] . For it operates in the absence of vacuum chamber and system, the costs of equipment investment and maintenance are greatly reduced and it is ready to be used in a pattern of continuous in-line processing. It has been studied that the radio-frequency (rf) capacitively coupled plasma discharge is an important approach to generate a stable, homogeneous, arcless plasma discharge at atmospheric pressure, e.g., one-dimensional plasma source (line source) employed for large-area surface treatment [2\u20139] . The addition of several tenths percent of oxygen in carrier gas is capable of yielding a high concentration of reactive species, which is comparable to a pure oxygen discharge at low pressure of several Torrs. Furthermore, at high gas pressure the damage on the substrate is prevented from bombarding by accelerated ions [3] . However, when the economic argon is used as a carrier gas and the reactive gas, such as O 2 and N 2 , is added to produce reactive species, several issues arise with respect to its ignition, stability, and restricted chemical and physical operation window. In our previous work, we have developed the argon rf-APGD in a bare metal electrode configuration by introducing a dielectric strip between bare metal electrodes in its gas inlet end [9] . The allowable oxygen-to-argon ratio reaches 1.0 vol.% and the generated Ar/O 2 plasma discharge is characterized by a low gas temperature and good spatial homogeneity. And its treatment efficacy is demonstrated by the practical use in ashing of carbon black. In this work, we evaluate the important plasma parameters in the rf-APGD, the electron density n e and the electron temperature T e , to inspect the discharge characteristics of the Ar/O 2 plasma discharge by means of measuring its electric characteristics and establishing an equivalent electric circuit model of the plasma discharge and with use of an energy balance equation. 2 Experimental procedure The experimental setup is illustrated in Fig.\u00a01 where the reactor used in this study is composed of two parallel plate electrodes made of stainless steel, the surface of which for discharge is polished smoothly with sandpaper. Both electrodes are rectangular shape of 60 \u00d7 90 mm 2 and cooled with chilled water; the upper electrode is connected to a rf power supply (13.56 MHz) via a manual L-type matching box; the lower one is grounded. The gap spacing between the pair of electrodes is d = 1.6 mm. A dielectric strip of 1 mm thick, 60 mm long, and 2.3 mm wide is applied on the lower electrode near the gas inlet port to construct a gas passage with a narrow cross section of 0.6 \u00d7 60 mm 2 . The introduction of this gas inlet passage has been shown to be important and necessary in enhancing the oxygen-to-argon ratio up to 1.0 vol.% while exciting an stable Ar/O 2 plasma discharge at atmospheric pressure. The power supply is equipped with a pair of meters for simultaneously monitoring forward power and reflected power; therefore, the input power is able to be measured directly, when the complete matching is achieved by adjusting the tuning capacitor in matching box. A Pearson 4100 current probe and a high-voltage probe P6015A are connected directly to the powered electrode to capture current and voltage waveforms. In the experimental procedure, the argon gas (99.995% pure) is excited first and then the oxygen gas is added into argon discharge gradually till to a certain amount. The total gas flow rate is set at 28 l/min and the flow rate of argon and oxygen is best controlled by precise mass flow controllers, for a fluctuation of gas flow may deteriorate the discharge stability when the electronegative gas is fed. The detailed experiment setup and its discharge images could be found in [9] for a good illustration. 3 Results and discussion In Fig.\u00a02 , the discharge current and voltage in RMS values versus the input power measured in the glow discharge at total gas flow rate of 28 l/min are shown for three different oxygen-to-argon ratios of 0.0, 0.3, and 0.6 vol.%, respectively. With increasing input power, both discharge current and voltage increase simultaneously. In Fig.\u00a02 (a), the turning points (O, P, and Q for three cases) on the curves connecting two linearly varying segments of the discharge voltage versus input power indicate the transition from normal to abnormal glow discharge. With the data in Fig.\u00a02 , a current and voltage characteristic (CVC) curve is obtained for these three different oxygen-to-argon ratios and correspondingly plotted in Fig.\u00a03 . The turning points are labeled by O, P, and Q respectively for three cases in Fig.\u00a03 . Since the discharge covers partial area of electrodes in normal glow discharge and it is difficult to define the discharge area in the current experiment setup, we pay our attention to the abnormal discharge regime to inspect the dependence of the electron temperature and the electron density on the input power and the different oxygen-to-argon ratios. In fact, it is in this abnormal discharge region that the practical applications are carried out to implement a large-area surface treatment. It is notable that the discharge current increases linearly with the applied voltage even for admixture of oxygen into argon in this abnormal discharge regime and the maximum value of the discharge current in termination of the abnormal glow discharge for these three oxygen-to-argon ratios are almost identical at the RMS value of 2.8 A, while the corresponding values of input power are quite different, as shown at 220, 340, and 380 W for the oxygen-to-argon ratios of 0.0, 0.3, and 0.6 vol.%, respectively. The spatiotemporal structure of O 2 plasma discharge between parallel plates driven by rf of 13.56 MHz at pressure of 0.5 Torr has been investigated by using the relaxation continuum model by considering the elementary particles, O 2 + , O + O 2 \u2212 , O \u2212 , electrons, and O in O 2 [10,11] . The numerical simulation shows that even in pure oxygen discharge, the dominant carriers of the total current are still electrons in the bulk plasma region due to large electron mobility, although the number density of heavy charged particles, O 2 + and O \u2212 , are two orders of magnitude more than the electron density. For our case of mixture of no more than 1.0 vol.% of oxygen into argon, the oxygen concentration is almost equal to that in pure oxygen discharge at pressure of several tenths Torr; however, the mean-free-path length of particles is reduced greatly due to high density of argon atoms at atmospheric pressure. And taking into account the fact that the conduction current predominates over the displacement current in the bulk of plasma and the total current continuity is conserved in the circuit, it is reasonable to assume that the electron density n e is proportional to the amplitude value of applied current I rf as follows, (1) n e = \u03be I rf in which the coefficient \u03be is a complex function of input power and oxygen-to-argon ratio and trivially dependent of n e . The structure of an electronegative discharge can be nonuniform, consisting of two plasma regions: a central electronegative region and an edge electropositive region, followed by sheath with immobile positive ions in vicinity of the electrodes. In the case of high pressure, the electropositive region diminishes and the negative ions are attracted in bulk plasma [12] . In an approximation, a homogenous model is employed in this study to describe the \u03b1 -mode discharge structure with a central bulky neutral region embedded by two sheaths, as adopted in [13] to model an argon plasma discharge. Then, the capacitance of both sheaths neighboring the electrodes is expressed as C s = en e \u03c9\u03b5 0 A 2 /2I rf = e\u03be\u03c9\u03b5 0 A 2 /2 , where \u03c9 is the angular frequency of rf, A is the electrode area, e is the one electron charge, and \u03b5 0 is the permittivity of free space, and the second equality is derived with the aid of Eq.\u00a0 (1) [12] . As far as the plasma bulk is concerned, it is usually lumped as an equivalent resistor R p , which is inversely proportional to discharge current I rf as R p = \u03b6/I rf with the introduced coefficient \u03b6 being associated with input power and oxygen-to-argon ratio [12,13] . The resistor is connected in series with the sheaths capacitors to compose an equivalent C s -R p series circuit to model the plasmas generated in the reactor. Therefore, we are able to establish the relation between the amplitude value of the externally applied voltage V rf and that of the current I rf as follows (2) V rf 2 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03be \u22c5 I rf 2 = \u03b6 2 where \u03b7 = 2/e\u03b5 0 \u03c9 2 A 2 . The coefficients \u03be and \u03b6 are determined simultaneously by fitting the experimental data in CVC curves with Eq.\u00a0 (2) ; thereby, the electron density at the specific discharge current is further evaluated by making use of Eq.\u00a0 (1) . Thus obtained electron density at various input power for three oxygen-to-argon ratios, 0.0, 0.3, and 0.6 vol.%, is plotted in Fig.\u00a04 . As the input power increases in the abnormal discharge regime, the electron density increases proportionally for all three cases. However, the electron density in mixture of oxygen into argon is lower than that in pure argon discharge. As the oxygen is an electronegative gas and the plasma discharge is generated at high gas pressure, the attachment processes become important and much amount of electrons participate in the processes to produce amount of negative ions, e.g., O 2 \u2212 and O \u2212 , as a loss channel of electrons. As it is shown in Fig.\u00a04 , when oxygen gas is fed into argon plasma, about half of electrons are depleted by such attachment so that the electron density is reduced to its half value for pure argon discharge at the same power density. Moreover, the energy balance equation for free electron is employed to evaluate the average electron temperature. Considering the discharge occurring at atmospheric pressure, some trivial terms (such as the energy loss due to radiation and inelastic collisions between electrons with excited species and ions) in the energy balance equation can be neglected in the calculation and only the dominant terms are kept, which makes the quantitative discussion possible and without loss of verity [13\u201315] . Thus a reduced power balance is achieved for a steady state as follows, (3) P a b s \u2248 n e n A r ( K i z , A r \u03b5 i z , A r + K e x , A r \u03b5 a * , A r + K e l , e - a 3 m e M A r T e ) + n e n O 2 ( K i z , O 2 ( 2 ) \u03b5 i z , O 2 ( 2 ) + \u2211 j = 3 , 4 K e x , O 2 ( j ) \u03b5 m * , O 2 ( j ) + \u2211 j = 5 , 6 , 7 K d i s s , O 2 ( j ) \u03b5 d i s s , O 2 ( j ) + K e l , e - m ( 1 ) \u03b5 e l , O 2 ( 1 ) ) where P abs is the input power density (W/cm 3 ), m e , M Ar and M O 2 are the mass of the electron, atomic argon, and molecular oxygen, respectively, and n Ar and n O2 are the particle density of Ar and O 2 . And K iz,Ar and K iz,O 2 (2) are the ionization rate coefficients and \u03b5 iz,Ar and \u03b5 iz,O 2 (2) are the first ionization energy (eV) from ground state of Ar and O 2 ; K ex,Ar and K ex,O 2 ( j ) are the excitation rate coefficients and \u03b5 a*,Ar and \u03b5 m*,O 2 ( j ) are the excitation energy (eV) by direct impact from ground state of Ar and O 2 ; K el,e-a and K el,e-m (1) are the electron-argon and electron-oxygen elastic-collision rate coefficients for Ar and O 2 ; and K diss,O 2 ( j ) represents the dissociative rate coefficient and \u03b5 diss,O 2 ( j ) is the electron energy loss (eV) due to the dissociative processes of O 2 . The above rate coefficients corresponding to the various kinetic processes are all functions of electron temperature T e . And the formula and values for argon could be found in our previous work in [13] and as for oxygen the reaction set for electron direct impact on ground state O 2 as well as the rate constants and the electron energy loss employed in our calculation of T e are listed in Table\u00a01 . Under the consideration of discussions given in [14] , it is found that the reasonable simplification made by approximating the energy balance equation with Eq.\u00a0 (3) only have a minimal effect on the calculation of electron temperature. Now it is capable of solving the Eq.\u00a0 (3) to obtain electron temperature T e with use of the experimental data ( I \u2013 P curve) in Fig.\u00a02 (b) and the calculated data ( n e \u2013 P curve) in Fig.\u00a04 . And thus evaluated electron temperatures corresponding to each input power are plotted in Fig.\u00a05 for three cases of different oxygen-to-argon ratio. It is found that the electron temperature varies in the small range of 0.06 eV around the average value of 1.4 eV (from 1.37 to 1.43 eV) even though the input power is increased greatly from 100 to 400 W and the oxygen gas is mixed into argon plasma with the oxygen-to-argon ratios of 0.3 and 0.6 vol.%. Our calculated electron temperatures as well as its variation tendency in our studied range of the oxygen-to-argon ratio (smaller than 1.0 vol.%) are well consistent with previously reported results obtained with use of zero-dimensional global model developed by Park, etc. for He/O 2 and Ar/O 2 atmospheric pressure glow discharge [18] . We know that the electron temperature, T e , is related to the total effective cross section of argon-oxygen mixture, \u03c3 T , and the total particle density, n 0 , as, T e \u221d E / \u03c3 T n 0 , where E is the strength of the electric field. The total effective cross section can be further expanded in terms of the densities of argon and oxygen, n Ar and n O 2 , in the mixture and the total cross sections of argon and oxygen, \u03c3 Ar and \u03c3 O 2 , as follows \u03c3 T = ( n Ar / n 0 ) \u03c3 Ar + ( n O 2 / n 0 ) \u03c3 O 2 . In the experiment that the argon is diluted with O 2 by a small amount less than 1.0 vol.%, the dominant term in the expression of \u03c3 T is the first one of the above relation, which is relevant to atomic argon. Because \u03c3 Ar increases with the energy of impact electron, the proportional dependence of T e on E is counteracted by the increasing variation of \u03c3 T with E ; therefore the electron temperature increases slightly with the input power [13] . Moreover, although the oxygen component in argon plasma discharge could consume the free motion electrons to reduce the electron density pronouncedly due to its electronegative property, the addition of oxygen into carrier gas in the studied range smaller than 1.0 vol.% is imposing ignorable influence on determination of the electron temperature. 4 Conclusions The electric characteristics of the capacitive plasma discharge in the developed plasma reactor driven by rf power supply are investigated experimentally in this work. On the basis of equivalent electric circuit model of plasma discharge, the electron densities of the generated Ar/O 2 plasma discharge are calculated with the experimental results of the discharge current and voltage versus input power at various oxygen-to-argon ratios. Moreover, the electron temperatures are estimated by means of an energy balance equation to examine its dependence on the input power and the oxygen component at various oxygen-to-argon ratios in a range smaller than 1.0 vol.%. It is found that the electron density is reduced by half and the electron temperature takes an almost invariable value of 1.4 eV in our study regime when the oxygen is fed into argon plasma.

        "abstract": "This pilot study was undertaken to assess the effect of weekly docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (DCF) as a preoperative treatment for gastric cancer with multiple synchronous hepatic metastases. Gastric cancer patients with synchronous multiple liver metastasis were first given preoperative chemotherapy consisting of two courses (each course consisted of 6-week administration and 2-week withdrawal) of weekly DCF regimen. Following the operation, postoperative chemotherapy and hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) treatment were performed as required. Eight patients completed two courses of preoperative chemotherapy with weekly DCF regimen. No toxicity of grade 3 or more was observed during the course of chemotherapy. The response rate was 100% according to the RECIST criteria. Seven of the patients have survived for over 1 year, and six of them are still alive after more than 1 year. Because of the unexpected high response to weekly DCF, we consider that it should be verified through phase II and III trials as an important part of the comprehensive treatment for gastric cancer with liver metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies targeting PD-L1/PD-1 have been shown to be effective in treating several types of human cancer. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), little is known about the expression of PD-L1/PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment or its potential correlation with BRAF V600E mutation status. In this study, we examined the expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and BRAF V600E in PTC by immunohistochemistry and investigated the clinical significance of expression status. We studied the expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and BRAF V600E by immunohistochemical staining in 110 cases of PTC with a diameter >\u20091\u00a0cm. Cases with a background of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) were excluded, as differentiating lymphocytes in the context of CLT from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is difficult. We classified PD-L1+/PD-1+ expression as type 1 (41%), PD-L1-/PD-1- as type 2 (17%), PD-L1+/PD-1- as type 3 (5%), and PD-L1-/PD-1+ as type 4 (37%). Significant correlations were found between expression of BRAF V600E and that of PD-L1 and PD-1. The positive correlation observed between expression of BRAF V600E and PD-L1/PD-1 suggests that immunotherapies targeting PD-L1/PD-1 might be effective for PTC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation, which are refractory to radioiodine therapy.",

        "abstract": "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques are not specific to Alzheimer's disease and occur with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Soluble brain A\u03b2 may be neuroprotective and increases in response to neuroinflammation. Sepsis is associated with neurocognitive compromise. The objective was to determine, in a rat endotoxemia model of sepsis, whether neuroinflammation and soluble A\u03b2 production are associated with A\u03b2 plaque and hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the brain. Male Sprague Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS). Brain and blood levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 and cortical microglial density were measured in LPS-injected and control animals. Soluble brain A\u03b2 and p-tau were compared and A\u03b2 plaques were quantified and characterized. Brain uptake of [F]flutemetamol was measured by phosphor imaging. LPS endotoxemia resulted in elevations of cytokines in blood and brain. Microglial density was increased in LPS-treated rats relative to controls. LPS resulted in increased soluble A\u03b2 and in p-tau levels in whole brain. Progressive increases in morphologically-diffuse A\u03b2 plaques occurred throughout the interval of observation (to 7-9 days post LPS). LPS endotoxemia resulted in increased [F]flutemetamol in the cortex and increased cortex: white matter ratios of activity. In conclusion, LPS endotoxemia causes neuroinflammation, increased soluble A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 diffuse plaques in the brain. A\u03b2 PET tracers may inform this neuropathology. Increased p-tau in the brain of LPS treated animals suggests that downstream consequences of A\u03b2 plaque formation may occur. Further mechanistic and neurocognitive studies to understand the causes and consequences of LPS-induced neuropathology are warranted.",

To enhance the antenna integration, substrate-integrated technology is also introduced to form a cylindrical cavity.

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common primary intrinsic brain tumor and remains incurable despite maximal therapy. Glioblastomas display cellular hierarchies with self-renewing glioma-initiating cells (GICs) at the apex. To discover new GIC targets, we used in vivo delivery of phage display technology to screen for molecules selectively binding GICs that may be amenable for targeting. Phage display leverages large, diverse peptide libraries to identify interactions with molecules in their native conformation. We delivered a bacteriophage peptide library intravenously to a glioblastoma xenograft in vivo then derived GICs. Phage peptides bound to GICs were analyzed for their corresponding proteins and ranked based on prognostic value, identifying VAV3, a Rho guanine exchange factor involved tumor invasion, and CD97 (cluster of differentiation marker 97), an adhesion G-protein-coupled-receptor upstream of Rho, as potentially enriched in GICs. We confirmed that both VAV3 and CD97 were preferentially expressed by tumor cells expressing GIC markers. VAV3 expression correlated with increased activity of its downstream mediator, Rac1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1), in GICs. Furthermore, targeting VAV3 by ribonucleic acid interference decreased GIC growth, migration, invasion and in vivo tumorigenesis. As CD97 is a cell surface protein, CD97 selection enriched for sphere formation, a surrogate of self-renewal. In silico analysis demonstrated VAV3 and CD97 are highly expressed in tumors and inform poor survival and tumor grade, and more common with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Finally, a VAV3 peptide sequence identified on phage display specifically internalized into GICs. These results show a novel screening method for identifying oncogenic pathways preferentially activated within the tumor hierarchy, offering a new strategy for developing glioblastoma therapies.",

        "title": "Evaluating dosage effects for the positive action program: How implementation impacts internalizing symptoms, aggression, school hassles, and self-esteem.",
        "abstract": "Positive Action (PA) is a school-based intervention for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students that aims to decrease problem behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use) and increase positive behaviors (e.g., academic achievement, school engagement). PA has a long history of documented success achieving these aims, making it an Evidence Based Practice (EBP). Intervention research on EBPu0027s has established the importance of implementation fidelity, especially with regard to program dosage; failure to properly implement an EBP can have negative consequences on targeted outcomes, especially if participants are exposed to a low dosage of the program (e.g., fewer lessons than specified). Much of the current research on PA has neglected to examine how program dosage impacts PAu0027s effect on targeted outcomes. Using propensity score models, multiple imputation, and a 2-level hierarchical linear model, the current study fills this gap and examines how different dosages of PA as measured by years participating in PA and number of PA lessons, impacts adolescent internalizing symptoms, aggression, perceptions of school hassles, and self-esteem over a 3-year period. The current sample included middle school students in grades 6, 7, and 8 (N = 5,894). The findings indicate that students who received 3 years of the PA intervention and a high number of PA lessons had a significantly higher self-esteem score than those who received 0 years of PA or zero lessons. Participants who received 1 year of PA also reported significantly lower school hassle scores than those who received 0 years. Dosage had no statistically significant effects on aggression or internalizing score. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record(c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved). Language: en",

Positive Action (PA) is an SEL program for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students. Extensive research documents the effectiveness of PA in decreasing adolescent risk factors and enhancing protective factors, however, minimal research has examined the mechanisms of change responsible for these effects. The current study examined whether PA was associated with SEL outcomes (i.e., alcohol use, aggression, depression, and anxiety) through school hassles (a proxy for school climate). The analytic sample consisted of 8333 ethnically/racially diverse, rural adolescents (51% female) in grades 6 through 12. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data. Engagement in PA was significantly associated with decreased school hassles, indicating an improvement in school climate. Subsequently, decreases in school hassles were significantly associated with decreased alcohol use, aggression, depression, and anxiety. Thus, there was an indirect effect between PA, decreased school hassles, and improved adolescent outcomes. Implications were discussed.",

        "abstract": "The current study examined risk and protective factors across microsystems that impact the development of internalizing symptoms and aggression over 4 years in a sample of culturally diverse, rural adolescents. We explored whether risk and protective factors across microsystems were associated with changes in rates of internalizing symptoms and aggressive behavior. Data came from the Rural Adaptation Project (RAP), a 5-year longitudinal panel study of more than 4,000 students from 26 public middle schools and 12 public high schools. Three level HLM models were estimated to predict internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and aggression. Compared with other students, risk for internalizing symptoms and aggression was elevated for youth exposed to risk factors in the form of school hassles, parent-child conflict, peer rejection, and delinquent friends. Microsystem protective factors in the form of ethnic identity, religious orientation, and school satisfaction decreased risk for aggression, but were not associated with internalizing symptoms, whereas future orientation and parent support decreased risk for internalizing symptoms, but not aggression. RESULTS indicate that risks for internalizing symptoms and aggression are similar, but that unique protective factors are related to these adolescent behavioral health outcomes.

        "abstract": "Positive Action is a school-based program that aims to decrease problem behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use) and increase positive behaviors (e.g., school engagement, academic achievement). Although a number of studies have shown that Positive Action successfully achieves these goals, few studies have evaluated the program\u2019s effectiveness in rural schools. Given that rural youth are at an increased risk for risky behaviors (e.g., violence, substance use), this is a critical gap in the existing Positive Action research base. The current study assesses the impact of Positive Action on change rates of self-esteem, school hassles, aggression, and internalizing symptoms in a group (N\u00a0=\u00a01246, 52\u00a0% female) of ethnically/racially diverse (27\u00a0% White, 23\u00a0% African American, 12\u00a0% mixed race/other, 8\u00a0% Latino, 30\u00a0% as American Indian) middle school youth (age range 9\u201320) located in two violent, low-income rural counties in North Carolina. One county engaged in Positive Action over the 3-year study window while the other county did not. Following multiple imputation and propensity score analysis, 4 two-level hierarchical linear models were run using each of the outcome measures as dependent variables. The results indicate that the program generates statistically significant beneficial effects for youth from the intervention county on self-esteem scores and school hassles scores. Although the program generates beneficial effects for intervention youth on the change in aggression scores, the finding is not statistically significant. The finding on the change in internalizing scores shows a non-significant detrimental effect: the youth from the comparison county have lower internalizing scores than those from the intervention county. Implications are discussed.",

Using four waves of data, three-level hierarchical linear models were estimated for males and females. Results revealed that negative peer influence was a particularly salient risk factor for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors among males, although future optimism did not emerge as a significant protective factor.

Then, Monte Carlo method with nucleation in every MC step is used for the simulation of the grain growth in FSW. In addition, the process of dynamic recrystallization which results in the nucleation of new grains has been modeled. The model is validated by comparison of both experiments and numerical results from the literature. The width of the stirring zone has been estimated by monitoring the movements of the traced material particles and by identifying the region containing dynamically recrystallized fine grains. The inner border of the heat-affected zone has been determined by monitoring the material flow, while the outer border has been identified by monitoring the average grain size as a function of the lateral distance from the weld. The effect of two FSW process parameters, tool rotational speed and tool shoulder diameter, is investigated. An increase in either of these two parameters has been found to increase the overall grain size as well as the width of the welding zones.",

        "abstract": "Background: The associations between early life-socioeconomic status and health, specifically substance use, are well substantiated. The vulnerabilities associated with adversity in childhood, particularly poverty, can have a cumulative effect on an individual\u2019s risk and resilience throughout the life course. While several studies substantiate the relationship between substance use and welfare participation, less known is the impact of and prevalence of behavioral health problems later in life among young adults who were welfare recipients before age 18. Objective: This article explores whether childhood welfare participation before the age of 18 years influences substance use until young adulthood (24\u201334 years). Methods: This study used Add Health data with sample sizes ranging from 12,042 to 12,324 respondents, and propensity score matching methods to balance the samples and account for selection bias. Matched data were then used to run a series of regression models. Results: Those who participated in welfare before the age of 18 years had a significant lower probability of remaining substance-free until young adulthood (marijuana-free by 30%, p < 0.001; and other illicit substances-free by 16%, p < 0.05). However, no significant between-group differences were found on any of the alcohol-related variables. Conclusions: Findings highlight long-term behavioral health risks, especially substance use, faced by young adults who participated in welfare before the age of 18 years. Acknowledging the vulnerabilities associated with welfare participation and living in poverty could help increase the effectiveness of program and treatment efforts. The prevention of long-term behavioral health disorders hinges on early diagnosis and intervention.",

        "abstract": "Acculturation-based family conflicts can influence parent-child relationships and children's development among immigrant families. The Asian American Family Conflict Scale (AAFCS) was developed to measure conflicting practices and values between parents and children in the context of acculturation. Given that considerable cultural and institutional changes have taken place in original countries for the Chinese immigrant population, it is important to investigate whether the factor structure of the AAFCS is appropriate for measuring the attitudes and practices of acculturation among the current Chinese immigrant population. A sample of Chinese American immigrant parents (n = 269) from the Survey of Asian American Families was employed to conduct exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The principal-axis factoring method of EFA was used to determine the factor structure of the AAFCS, followed by the weighted least squares means and variance estimation in CFA to assess the fitness of the measurement model. A nine-item one-factor model (without the first item regarding decision making) was suggested by EFA with all factor loadings greater than .45. CFA results indicated a good fit of the nine-item one-factor model: \u03c7 (27, 296) = 40.24, p < .05, root-mean-square error of approximation = .04, 90% CI [.00, .07], comparative fit index = .99, Tucker-Lewis index = .99. The validation of the AAFCS is useful for practitioners and researchers to better assess the outcomes of acculturation conflicts among Chinese immigrants who are adjusting to living in the United States. This study can inform social work practitioners in regards to cultural sensitivity and cultural competency when working with Chinese immigrants and their U.S.-born children.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSupervision that provides supports helps students to develop intervention skills and forms a strong professional identity. Yet, the literature on supervision largely stems from Western countries. Less is known about supervisory relationships in countries such as China. This article presents a qualitative case study of three MSW students and two supervisors in Mainland China focusing on how the practice context and Chinese cultural norms intersect with student expectations over a 10-month period. Findings demonstrate important differences between student expectations for supervision and the reality of their experience. These differences are based in current realities but reinforced by cultural norms.",

However, since their inception, welfare programs have been accompanied by contentious debate about their impact on the wellbeing of participants and, hence, about their collective value as a strategy for alleviating poverty. This study uses welfare participation as a marker of lower socioeconomic status to identify and synthesize the relationship between welfare participation and depression among youth. A systematic review was undertaken based on literature published between 1997 and 2017 through a search of 9 electronic databases, 15 reports met criteria for study inclusion. Four descriptive studies reported mixed findings. Of the 11 comparison studies, 10 studies showed consistent findings that participation in welfare programs was associated with a higher vulnerability for depression. Discussion includes the effects of stigma related to welfare and mental health treatment, and the implications for policy makers, social workers, and future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A general correlation for heat transfer coefficients of saturated flow boiling is developed based on the first experimental database consisting of 17,778 data points from 101 sources and 13 different fluids. The new correlation makes a significant breakthrough in the prediction accuracy for saturated flow boiling heat transfer, achieving a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 4.5% against the database, with 68.1% and 89.7% of the data falling within \u00b15% and \u00b110% error bands, respectively. The new correlation is validated and compared with 45 existing correlations on the base of the second database of saturated flow boiling heat transfer. The second database contains 6664 data points from 60 sources and 18 different fluids and has no duplicate data from the first. The validation results show that the new correlation has an MAD of 4.4% against the second database, with 69.0% and 93.5% of the data within \u00b15% and \u00b110% error bands respectively, further confirming its superior prediction accuracy and reliability. The best existing correlation for the second database, meanwhile, has an MAD of 26.0%, with only 13.0% and 26.0% of the data falling within \u00b15% and \u00b110% error bands, respectively.

A number of correlations for subcooled flow boiling heat transfer were proposed. However, their prediction accuracy for water was not systematically investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive review of correlations of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer. A large database of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer of water containing 1184 data points is compiled from 14 published articles, based on which 21 correlations of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer are assessed, and their prediction accuracy is analyzed for different channel sizes, channel shapes, and flow directions. The results are helpful for understanding the prediction methods of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer and choosing a proper correlation for a given application.",

        "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type\u00a09 (PCSK9) is a lipid regulatory gene involved in cell apoptosis. However, the function and mechanism of PCSK9 in neuronal apoptosis following hyperlipidemia remains to be elucidated. The present study established a hyperlipidemic mouse model by feeding a high\u2011fat diet (HFD) to 6\u2011week\u2011old apoE(\u2011/\u2011) mice. Plasma lipid levels, hippocampal lipid accumulation, hippocampal histology, and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis were all monitored for changes. The expression levels of PCSK9, \u03b2\u2011secretase\u00a01 (BACE1), B\u2011cell lymphoma\u00a02 (Bcl\u20112), Bcl\u20112\u2011associated X\u00a0protein (Bax), and caspase\u20113 in hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neurons were also measured. Results demonstrated that a HFD increased the lipid accumulation in the CA3 hippocampus and the levels of plasma lipids, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, low\u2011density lipoprotein, and high\u2011density lipoprotein. In addition, CA3 neurons in the HFD group indicated apparent injuries and increased neuronal apoptosis, which are associated with the expression of Bcl\u20112, Bax, and caspase\u20113. A HFD also increased the expression levels of PCSK9 and BACE1. BACE1 promotes cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to generate \u03b2\u2011amyloid peptide (A\u03b2), which induces neuronal apoptosis. Protein levels of A\u03b2 are associated with the observation of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus of the HFD group. The results suggest that hyperlipidemia regulates neuronal apoptosis by increasing PCSK9 and BACE1 expression. Overall, the current study may elucidate the role of lipid metabolism disorder in AD pathogenesis.",

The present study established a hyperlipidemic mouse model by feeding a high\u2011fat diet (HFD) to 6\u2011week\u2011old apoE(\u2011/\u2011) mice. Plasma lipid levels, hippocampal lipid accumulation, hippocampal histology, and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis were all monitored for changes. The expression levels of PCSK9, \u03b2\u2011secretase\u00a01 (BACE1), B\u2011cell lymphoma\u00a02 (Bcl\u20112), Bcl\u20112\u2011associated X\u00a0protein (Bax), and caspase\u20113 in hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neurons were also measured. Results demonstrated that a HFD increased the lipid accumulation in the CA3 hippocampus and the levels of plasma lipids, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, low\u2011density lipoprotein, and high\u2011density lipoprotein. In addition, CA3 neurons in the HFD group indicated apparent injuries and increased neuronal apoptosis, which are associated with the expression of Bcl\u20112, Bax, and caspase\u20113. A HFD also increased the expression levels of PCSK9 and BACE1. BACE1 promotes cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to generate \u03b2\u2011amyloid peptide (A\u03b2), which induces neuronal apoptosis. Protein levels of A\u03b2 are associated with the observation of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus of the HFD group. The results suggest that hyperlipidemia regulates neuronal apoptosis by increasing PCSK9 and BACE1 expression. Overall, the current study may elucidate the role of lipid metabolism disorder in AD pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP) has been confirmed to reduce the ischemia-reperfusion injury but its mechanisms are still not clear. This study clarified the mechanism of LRIP based on the nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-P38 pathway of neutrophils. Rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used in this study. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was carried out by MCAO 1.5 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. LRIP operation was performed to the left femoral artery at 0, 1 or 3 h after reperfusion. Behavioral testing, including postural reflex test, vibrissae-elicited forelimb placing test and tail hang test, showed that LRIP operated at 0 h of reperfusion could significantly ameliorate these behavioral scores. Pathological examinations, infarct size, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity showed that LRIP operated at 0 h of reperfusion could significantly ameliorate the pathological scores, reduce the infarct size and MPO activity in the brain and increase the MPO activity in the left leg. By using Neutrophil counting, immunofluorescence and real-time PCR techniques, we found that LRIP operated at 0 h of reperfusion could reduce neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood and downregulate the activation of neutrophil in the peripheral blood and rat brain. Western blots revealed that MyD88, TRAF6, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) in neutrophils and the phosphorylation of p47phox (Ser 304 and Ser 345) in neutrophil could be downregulated by LRIP. Our study suggests that LRIP inhibits the number and activation of neutrophils in the rat brain and peripheral blood linked to down-regulating the activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils by MyD88/TRAF6/p38-MAPK pathway.",

Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, inhibits sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). In this study, we characterized the effect of the PTEN - SREBP-1 pathway on HBV HCV co-replication in a cellular model. We found that HBV and HCV can co-replicate in Huh-7 cells with no interference. Overexpression of PTEN inhibits, whereas PTEN knockdown enhances, HBV replication as well as HBV and HCV co-replication. Knocking down SREBP-1 decreases HBV replication in an HBx-dependent manner. SREBP-1 knockdown also decreases HCV replication. PTEN knockdown is concomitant with increased nuclear SREBP-1 levels. PTEN and SREBP-1 double knockdown results in intermediate levels of HBV and HCV replication in mono- and co-replication scenarios. Taken together, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the PTEN - SREBP-1 pathway can regulate HBV HCV co-replication.",

        "abstract": "The nucleus represents a cellular compartment where the discrimination of self from non-self nucleic acids is vital. While emerging evidence establishes a nuclear non-self DNA sensing paradigm, the nuclear sensing of non-self RNA, such as that from nuclear-replicating RNA viruses, remains unexplored. Here, we report the identification of nuclear-resident RIG-I actively involved in nuclear viral RNA sensing. The nuclear RIG-I, along with its cytoplasmic counterpart, senses influenza A virus (IAV) nuclear replication leading to a cooperative induction of type I interferon response. Its activation signals through the canonical signaling axis and establishes an effective antiviral state restricting IAV replication. The exclusive signaling specificity conferred by nuclear RIG-I is reinforced by its inability to sense cytoplasmic-replicating Sendai virus and appreciable sensing of hepatitis B virus pregenomic RNA in the nucleus. These results refine the RNA sensing paradigm for nuclear-replicating viruses and reveal a previously unrecognized subcellular milieu for RIG-I-like receptor sensing.",

        "abstract": "Visual Grounding (VG) aims to locate the most relevant object or region in an image, based on a natural language query. The query can be a phrase, a sentence or even a multi-round dialogue. There are three main challenges in VG: 1) what is the main focus in a query; 2) how to understand an image; 3) how to locate an object. Most existing methods combine all the information curtly, which may suffer from the problem of information redundancy (i.e. ambiguous query, complicated image and a large number of objects). In this paper, we formulate these challenges as three attention problems and propose an accumulated attention (A-ATT) mechanism to reason among them jointly. Our A-ATT mechanism can circularly accumulate the attention for useful information in image, query, and objects, while the noises are ignored gradually. We evaluate the performance of A-ATT on four popular datasets (namely Refer-COCO, ReferCOCO+, ReferCOCOg, and Guesswhat?!), and the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in term of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Visual Grounding (VG) aims to locate the most relevant region in an image, based on a flexible natural language query but not a pre-defined label, thus it can be a more useful technique than object detection in practice. Most state-of-the-art methods in VG operate in a two-stage manner, wherein the first stage an object detector is adopted to generate a set of object proposals from the input image and the second stage is simply formulated as a cross-modal matching problem that finds the best match between the language query and all region proposals. This is rather inefficient because there might be hundreds of proposals produced in the first stage that need to be compared in the second stage, not to mention this strategy performs inaccurately. In this paper, we propose an simple, intuitive and much more elegant one-stage detection based method that joints the region proposal and matching stage as a single detection network. The detection is conditioned on the input query with a stack of novel Relation-to-Attention modules that transform the image-to-query relationship to an relation map, which is used to predict the bounding box directly without proposing large numbers of useless region proposals. During the inference, our approach is about 20x ~ 30x faster than previous methods and, remarkably, it achieves 18% ~ 41% absolute performance improvement on top of the state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.

        "abstract": "Real images often have multiple labels, i.e., each image is associated with multiple objects or attributes. Compared to single-label image classification, the multilabel classification problem is much more challenging due to several issues. At first, multiple objects can be anywhere in the image. Second, the importance of different regions in an image is different, and the regions of interest in a multilabel image can be very different from another one. Finally, multiple labels of an image can have label dependencies due to complex image structures. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose to predict the labels sequentially by applying the recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are used to encode the label dependencies. When predicting a specific label, we introduce a dynamic attention mechanism to enable the model to focus on only regions of interest in the image. Two benchmark datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO) are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our work. Moreover, we construct a new dataset, which includes many semantic dependent labels in each image, to verify the effectiveness of our model. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-arts, especially when predicting some semantic relative labels.",

        "abstract": "Target detection has occupied a pivotal position in distributed system. Scan statistics, as one of the most efficient detection methods, has been applied to a variety of anomaly detection problems and significantly improves the probability of detection. However, scan statistics cannot achieve the expected performance when the noise intensity is strong, or the signal emitted by the target is weak. The local vote algorithm can also achieve higher target detection rate. After the local vote, the counting rule is always adopted for decision fusion. The counting rule does not use the information about the contiguity of sensors but takes all sensors\u2019 data into consideration, which makes the result undesirable. In this paper, we propose a scan statistics with local vote (SSLV) method. This method combines scan statistics with local vote decision. Before scan statistics, each sensor executes local vote decision according to the data of its neighbors and its own. By combining the advantages of both, our method can obtain higher detection rate in low signal-to-noise ratio environment than the scan statistics. After the local vote decision, the distribution of sensors which have detected the target becomes more intensive. To make full use of local vote decision, we introduce a variable-step-parameter for the SSLV. It significantly shortens the scan period especially when the target is absent. Analysis and simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of our method.",

In this paper, a data fusion algorithm for target detection is proposed based on tree topology combine with the orderly full binary tree and we discuss the optima threshold fusion rule problem. Different from the conventional tree topology, the sensors in our topology are well ordered and the sensors with highest signal amplitude are selected as the fusion center. Moreover, we derive a fusion decision rule which take the channel noise into consideration based on this topology. B introducing the probability of error, we prove that with equal prior probability there is a concave function of the likelihood ratio threshold used in the sensor decision rule. In the case of minimizing the probability of error, the optimal threshold of each level can be obtained. Finally, the distributed detection performance of tree topology is analyzed and comparisons wit other topologies are drawn. These results show that the detection performance improves as the level decreases and our fusion rule can achieve a higher probability of detection.",

Nine samples from two states tested positive. Six of these were from New South Wales and 3 from South Australia in a total of eight varieties. All these varieties were imported from Europe within the last 4-19\u00a0years. A fragment of 431 nucleotides on the coat protein gene of Grapevine Pinot gris virus was targeted for virus identification by RT-PCR. The virus specificity of each positive sample was confirmed by sequencing followed by the BLASTn analysis which showed an identity of up to 99.3% to the virus sequences in the NCBI database. The phylogenetic tree as well as pairwise sequence identity showed that, although the virus sequence in each variety was unique, they all grouped with the isolates from Europe and well away from the South Korean and several Chinese isolates.

Although GLVd has the typical sequence motifs of the genus Apscaviroid, it is still an unassigned viroid. In this study, a sensitive, convenient, and rapid one-step RT-qPCR method using hydrolysis probes for the detection of GLVd was developed. Survey and bioassays were also performed for this viroid. Using this method in the survey of GLVd, a low infection rate of 2/226 in a grapevine germplasm resource nursery and a demonstration vineyard in China was determined. Bioassays using agroinfiltration showed that GLVd can infect 'Kyoho' grapevine but not any of the tested herbaceous plants. Furthermore, sequence variability of GLVd was analyzed in six GLVd-infected grapevines. Sequencing revealed a predominant variant with only a few nucleotide changes compared with the reference variant of GLVd. Therefore, the developed RT-qPCR method should be helpful for determining GLVd in other vineyards of the world. The low infection rate, host range, and sequence variability of GLVd have important implications to further improve our knowledge on this novel grapevine viroid.",

Accordingly the sputtered Mo films were proposed to serve as the capping layers, indicating that the 20-nm-thick Mo could effectively form ohmic contact with the a-IGZO, prevent the Ag diffusion into the SiO x , and make good adhesion to the glass substrates.

The a-IGZO TFTs in air were more thermally stable than the devices in the ambient argon. Oxygen, rather than nitrogen and moisture, was responsible for this improvement. Furthermore, the thermal stability of the a-IGZO TFTs improved with the increasing oxygen content in the surrounding atmosphere. The related physical mechanism was examined, indicating that the higher ambient oxygen content induced more combinations of the oxygen vacancies and adsorbed oxygen ions in the a-IGZO, which resulted in the larger defect formation energy. This larger defect formation energy led to the smaller variation in the threshold voltage for the corresponding TFT devices.",

More interestingly, very stable properties were observed in the bias stress and light illumination tests for these a-IZO/a-IGZO:N TFTs, as seemed to be the evident improvements over the prior arts. The improved performance and stability might be mainly due to the hetero-junctions in the channel layers and less interface/bulk trap density from the in situ nitrogen doping process in the a-IGZO layers. In addition, the passivation effect of the a-IGZO:N films also made some contributions to the stable properties exhibited in these novel DSCL TFTs.",

Two types of bottom-meson loops are discussed. We show that the loop contributions with all intermediate states being the $S$-wave ground state bottom mesons are negligible, while the loops with one bottom meson being the broad $B_0^ast$ or $B_1^prime$ resonance could provide the dominant contributions  the $Upsilon(5S) to Z_b^{(prime)} pi$. It is found that such a mechanism is not suppressed by the large width of the $B_0/B_1u0027$ resonance. In addition, we also estimate the branching ratios for the $Upsilon(6S) to Z_b^{(prime)} pi$ which could be tested by future precise measurements at Belle-II.",

        "abstract": "The identification of protein-ligand binding sites is critical to protein function annotation and drug discovery. The consensus algorithm COACH developed by us represents one of the most efficient approaches to protein-ligand binding sites prediction. One of the most commonly seen issues with the COACH prediction are the low quality of the predicted ligand-binding poses, which usually have severe steric clashes to the protein structure. Here, we present COACH-D, an enhanced version of COACH by utilizing molecular docking to refine the ligand-binding poses. The input to the COACH-D server is the amino acid sequence or the three-dimensional structure of a query protein. In addition, the users can also submit their own ligand of interest. For each job submission, the COACH algorithm is first used to predict the protein-ligand binding sites. The ligands from the users or the templates are then docked into the predicted binding pockets to build their complex structures. Blind tests show that the algorithm significantly outperforms other ligand-binding sites prediction methods. Benchmark tests show that the steric clashes between the ligand and the protein structures in the COACH models are reduced by 85% after molecular docking in COACH-D. The COACH-D server is freely available to all users at http://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/COACH-D/.",

        "abstract": "This tutorial presents topological methods for the analysis and visualization of scientific data from a user\u2019s perspective, with the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a recently released open-source library for topological data analysis. Topological methods have gained considerably in popularity and maturity over the last twenty years and success stories of established methods have been documented in a wide range of applications (combustion, chemistry, astrophysics, material sciences, etc.) with both acquired and simulated data, in both post-hoc and in-situ contexts. While reference textbooks have been published on the topic, no tutorial at IEEE VIS has covered this area in recent years, and never at a software level and from a user\u2019s point-of-view. This tutorial fills this gap by providing a beginner\u2019s introduction to topological methods for practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular, instead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this tutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice for concrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction or tracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve these tasks with TTK. First, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in data analysis, a brief overview of TTK\u2019s main entry point for end users, namely ParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK\u2019s main features will be given. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access TTK\u2019s features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions will concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative data analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers, in particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis projects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the usage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given. Presenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core authors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or industry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises and a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines, code, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants. This tutorial mostly targets students, practitioners and researchers who are not experts in topological methods but who are interested in using them in their daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological methods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a key technology for large-scale simulations that allows for adaptively changing the simulation mesh resolution, resulting in significant computational and storage savings. However, visualizing such AMR data poses a significant challenge due to the difficulties introduced by the hierarchical representation when reconstructing continuous field values. In this paper, we detail a comprehensive solution for interactive isosurface rendering of block-structured AMR data. We contribute a novel reconstruction strategy-the octant method-which is continuous, adaptive and simple to implement. Furthermore, we present a generally applicable hybrid implicit isosurface ray-tracing method, which provides better rendering quality and performance than the built-in sampling-based approach in OSPRay. Finally, we integrate our octant method and hybrid isosurface geometry into OSPRay as a module, providing the ability to create high-quality interactive visualizations combining volume and isosurface representations of BS-AMR data. We evaluate the rendering performance, memory consumption and quality of our method on two gigascale block-structured AMR datasets.",

Our technique efficiently supports tube primitives with fixed and varying radii, general acyclic graph structures with bifurcations, and correct transparency with interior surface removal. Such tube primitives are widely used in scientific visualization to represent diffusion tensor imaging tractographies, neuron morphologies, and scalar or vector fields of 3D flow. We implement our approach within the OSPRay ray tracing framework, and evaluate it on a range of interactive visualization use cases of fixed- and varying-radius streamlines, pathlines, complex neuron morphologies, and brain tractographies. Our proposed approach provides interactive, high-quality rendering, with low memory overhead.",

        "abstract": "Ibrutinib is highly efficacious and used at 420 mg/d for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously demonstrated a decline in BTK protein levels in CLL cells after 1 cycle of ibrutinib, suggesting that ibrutinib dose could be lowered after the first cycle without loss of biological effect. To test this postulate, a pilot study (NCT02801578) was designed to systematically reduce ibrutinib dosing within the same patient with CLL over three 28-day cycles. Following an initial cycle of 420 mg/d, the dose was reduced to 280 mg/d in cycle 2 and then to 140 mg/d in cycle 3. Eleven patients began study treatment, and nine completed the 3 cycles. Plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics (PK), BTK occupancy, and pharmacodynamic (PD) response at different doses of ibrutinib were compared. Plasma and intracellular levels of ibrutinib were dose-dependent, and even the lowest dose was sufficient to occupy on average >95% of BTK protein. In concert, BTK downstream signaling inhibition was maintained with 140 mg/d ibrutinib in cycle 3, and there were comparable reductions in total and phospho-BTK (Tyr223) protein levels across 3 cycles. Reductions of plasma chemokine CCL3 and CCL4 levels, considered to be biomarkers of ibrutinib response, were similar over the 3 cycles. These PK/PD data demonstrate that following one cycle of ibrutinib at the standard 420 mg/d dose, the dose can be reduced without losing biological activity. Clinical efficacy of lower doses needs to be systematically evaluated. Such dose reductions would lower drug cost, lessen untoward toxicity, and facilitate rationale-based combinations.",

        "abstract": "Ibrutinib is highly efficacious and used at 420 mg/d for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously demonstrated a decline in Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) protein levels in CLL cells after 1 cycle of ibrutinib, suggesting ibrutinib dose could be lowered after the first cycle without loss of biological effect. To test this postulate, a pilot study (NCT02801578) was designed to systematically reduce ibrutinib dosing within the same patient with CLL over the course of three 28-day cycles. After an initial cycle of 420 mg/d, the dose was reduced to 280 mg/d in cycle 2, and then to 140 mg/d in cycle 3. Eleven patients began study treatment, and 9 completed the 3 cycles. Plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics (PK), BTK occupancy, and pharmacodynamic (PD) response at different doses of ibrutinib were compared. Plasma and intracellular levels of ibrutinib were dose-dependent, and even the lowest dose was sufficient to occupy, on average, more than 95% of BTK protein. In concert, BTK downstream signaling inhibition was maintained with 140 mg/d ibrutinib in cycle 3, and there were comparable reductions in total and phospho-BTK (Tyr223) protein levels across 3 cycles. Reductions of plasma chemokine CCL3 and CCL4 levels, considered to be biomarkers of ibrutinib response, were similar during the 3 cycles. These PK/PD data demonstrate that after 1 cycle of ibrutinib at the standard 420 mg/d dose, the dose can be reduced without losing biological activity. Clinical efficacy of lower doses needs to be systematically evaluated. Such dose reductions would lower drug cost, lessen untoward toxicity, and facilitate rationale-based combinations. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02801578.",

        "abstract": "Inhibiting glycolysis remains an aspirational approach for the treatment of cancer. We recently demonstrated that SF2312, a natural product phosphonate antibiotic, is a potent inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase with potential utility for the collateral lethality-based treatment of Enolase-deficient glioblastoma (GBM). However, phosphonates are anionic at physiological pH, limiting cell and tissue permeability. Here, we show that addition of pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) groups to SF2312 (POMSF) dramatically increases potency, leading to inhibition of glycolysis and killing of ENO1-deleted glioma cells in the low nM range. But the utility of POMSF in vivo is dose-limited by severe hemolytic anemia. A derivative, POMHEX, shows equipotency to POMSF without inducing hemolytic anemia. POMHEX can eradicate intracranial orthotopic ENO1-deleted tumors, despite sub-optimal pharmacokinetic properties. Taken together, our data provide in vivo proof-of-principal for collateral lethality in precision oncology and showcase POMHEX as a useful molecule for the study of glycolysis in cancer metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1 and IDO2) and tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) are heme-containing enzymes that mediate the rate limiting step in the oxidative degradation of L-tryptophan (L-TRP) to kynurenine (KYN) metabolites. Tryptophan catabolism through the KYN metabolic pathway is now recognized as one of many mechanisms involved in tumor cell evasion of the immune surveillance system. Inhibition of the KYN pathway in the tumor microenvironment can lead to improved immune response and tumor growth suppression. Recently, clinical proof of concept of this mechanism has been demonstrated using an Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) inhibitor in combination with a PD-1 antagonist in a variety of tumor contexts. Consideration of known low molecular weight heme-co-ordinating ligands identified from the PDB, in conjunction with a virtual screen performed in-silico identified a number of potentially interesting starting points for medicinal chemistry development. Identification of an attractive indazole fragment as a starting point, and expansion into alternative bicyclic cores, resulted in the discovery of a family of imidazopyridines as potent human IDO1 inhibitors with u003e200 fold selectivity against TDO. Utilizing a structure-based design approach allowed rapid lead optimization that resulted in the identification of IACS-8968. Crystallography studies were conducted, and binding of IACS-8968 to the heme domain of the human IDO1 was confirmed. The homochiral imidazopyridine IACS-8968 displayed cellular IC 50 = 29 nM in a HeLa cell line expressing human IDO1 and IC 50 = 21 nM in a PANC02 mouse cell line expressing the murine IDO1 enzyme, showed satisfactory selectivity margin (u003e 150 fold) versus its CYP 450  inhibition profile and good oral bioavailability across species. PK/PD experiments indicated that, at equivalent exposure, IACS-8968 (sodium salt) and epacadostat decreased tumor KYN at comparable levels in CT26 syngeneic mouse model.

Temporary wafer bonding and debonding technology have been widely studied and developed over the last decade for use in various WLP technologies, such as package on package, fan-out integration, and 2.5-D and 3-D integration using through-silicon-via. Temporary bonding technology enables handling of thinned substrates (u003c100 \u03bcm), which can no longer self-support during backside processing and packaging. Moreover, some applications require the temporary bonding materials to withstand temperatures up to 250\u00b0C in high-vacuum conditions, and even up to 350\u00b0C or higher during the dopant activation step required for manufacturing power devices. Therefore, a simple yet effective temporary bonding process and material that can survive all the backside processes is highly desired. In this study, a series of formulations based on...",

        "title": "Temporary Bonding and Debonding Technologies for Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging",
        "abstract": "Handheld consumer electronics are requiring more complex packaging designs to accommodate higher component densities and reduce form factor. Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) has garnered much attention lately as a cost-effective way to achieve high interconnect density and manage larger I/O counts within an affordable package. Two principal approaches to manufacturing FOWLP components have evolved: chip-first and chip-last, which refer to the point in the process flow where the chips are attached and over-molded in the package. Many variants of these two main schemes are now starting to appear. Chip-first processes are more mature and have been in high-volume production for some time, while chip-last schemes are still largely in development. Both processing flows present unique substrate handling challenges that can be addressed by the use of a carrier support system. For example, reconstituted substrates formed in chip-first processes are prone to severe warping and bending, especially at high processing temperatures. Brewer Science is developing thermally stable polymeric adhesive systems and release agents for temporarily attaching reconstituted wafers and panels to a rigid carrier that mechanically stabilizes the substrates through processing and then allows the carrier to be separated with low force when processing is finished. Chip-first FOWLP processing also has two variants known as face-down and face-up. These designations refer to the position of the active face of the die with respect to the carrier when the dies are over-molded at the start of the process flow. While both variants have advantages and disadvantages, either flow can require that the substrate be  at some point so that processing on the opposing face of the die or package can be done. Transferring the reconstituted substrate from the original carrier to a temporarily bonded second carrier is often the most reliable way to mitigate downstream handling problems and preserve yield. Chip-last FOWLP processing usually starts with the build-up of a redistribution layer interconnect (RDL) on a carrier. The dies are flip chip-attached to the RDL and then over-molded near the very end of the process flow, which ensures that known good die (KGD) will not be lost in a defective package. In most cases, a temporary adhesive is not utilized to attach the build-up RDL to the carrier. Instead, the RDL is fabricated on a thin, laser-sensitive release layer that can be activated by exposure through the carrier at the point when separation is desired. On the other hand, some flows require the RDL to be flipped prior to die-attach, which again creates the need for a temporarily bonded carrier system to provide support. This paper will highlight how temporary bonding materials and processes can enable all of the prevailing FOWLP flows and explain how adhesives and release layer systems can be selected to achieve reliable performance.",

        "abstract": "Fan-out wafer-level-packaging (FOWLP) technology has been developed with various advantages, such as smaller form factor, lower cost, and simplified supply chain for heterogeneous integration. There have been several process schemes like chip-first or chip-last FOWLP integration discussed widely in conferences in recent years. One process in all of these process schemes has in common is the use of a temporary carrier for subsequent redistribution layer (RDL) formation, chip stacking and molding processes. Although the separation of a temporary carrier from the reconstituted wafer could be achieved without significant hurdles, there were few studies addressing optimization of carrier separation for throughput enhancement. Thus, this paper is designed to address the needs in optimizing carrier separation process based upon laser ablation technology. Two phases of experiments were designed to select the appropriate laser release layer and define optimal laser settings. The first experiment was used to evaluate correlation of the laser absorption, laser energy, and spot pitch versus completeness of laser ablation. The second experiment included RDL-first FOWLP integration. At first, 300-mm glass carriers (1000 \u00b5m thick) with coefficient of thermal expansion of 8\u00a0ppm/oC were treated by selected laser release layers. After deposition of 0.05-\u00b5m Ti/0.15 \u00b5m Cu on the glass carrier, passivation of around 8 \u00b5m was coated and patterned by lithography for electroplating Cu interconnections with a density of approximately 10% of the surface area. Subsequently, die bonding, build-up layers, or molding compound were applied on top to form a 200-\u00b5m reconstituted wafer. The reconstituted wafer was then separated from the glass carrier through a laser ablation process using a 355-nm laser to determine optimal throughput. Experiments to study correlation of laser release layer with laser settings along with a demonstration of full RDL-first FOWLP integration are discussed thoroughly to address the need of throughput enhancement, which could serve as cornerstone for realizing cost-effective RDL-first FOWLP.",

In this study, a novel fan-out WLP with RDL-first method is demonstrated. Finite element method was used to optimize the warpage control of a reconstituted wafer and to identify the material properties and fabrication for the FOWLP. Calculation results were applied in the design of the test vehicle.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Plant growth and grain yield of various upland crops in response to zeolite application have been extensively studied, but little information is available on the impact of zeolite application on rice grown in the lowlands under water stress. A two-year experiment was conducted using lysimeters in the field to evaluate the influence of zeolite application (15 t ha \u20131 ) on phenology, grain yield and grain quality in a local rice cultivar (Shennong 9765) under three irrigation regimes (CF, continuous flooding irrigation; IAWD, improved alternate wetting and drying irrigation; and AWD, alternate wetting and drying irrigation). Regardless of water supply, zeolite application significantly increased leaf area index (LAI) at all the measured stages except for tillering, SPAD values at the jointing\u2013booting and heading\u2013flowering stages, photosynthetic rate (Pn) at heading\u2013flowering stage, and grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Moreover, zeolite addition significantly increased the head rice rate and decreased the chalk rice rate and chalkiness. The IAWD and CF treatments had similar SPAD values and Pn at the heading\u2013flowering stage, and grain yield, while the AWD treatment significantly reduced those values, relative to the CF treatment. The IAWD and AWD treatments significantly increased WUE, milled rice rate, head rice rate, peak viscosity, and breakdown, but decreased water use, LAI, chalky rice rate, chalkiness, cool viscosity, and setback. These results suggest that the adoption of IAWD with 15 t ha \u20131  of zeolite application could reduce irrigation water use, increase grain yield and improve grain quality in rice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Clinoptilolite zeolite (Z) has been increasingly recognized as a valuable soil conditioner, which is beneficial to nitrogen (N) loss reduction and crop yield improvement. However, limited information is available for a rice production system, especially under alternate wetting and drying irrigation (AWD). Therefore, a 2-year field experiment with lysimeter was carried out in a split plot design with two irrigation regimes (CF: continuously flooded irrigation, AWD: alternate wetting and drying irrigation) as main plots and three Z amendment rates (0, 5 and 10\u2009t Z ha \u22121 ) as sub-plots. The impact of Z amendment on ammonia (NH 3 ) volatilization, N leaching, rice grain yield, water productivity (WP) and economic benefit were analyzed under both irrigation regimes. The results showed that AWD slightly reduced NH 3  volatilization without Z application, but significantly increased residual mineral N (RMN) in soil at the depths of 0\u2009\u2212\u200930 and 30\u2009\u2212\u200960\u2009cm, and NH 4  + -N and NO 3  \u2212 -N leaching, relative to CF. AWD-grown rice significantly improved WP without affecting grain yield in 2016, but reduced yield in 2017 without Z amendment. Compared with control (without Z amendment), addition of 5 and 10\u2009t Z ha -1  increased RMN by 12 and 21%, respectively in the 0\u2009\u2212\u200930\u2009cm soil depth, but reduced it by 18 and 32%, respectively in the 30\u2009\u2212\u200960\u2009cm soil depth. Total NH 3  volatilization and NH 4  + -N and NO 3  \u2212 -N leaching loss decreased with increasing rates of Z amendment. Z amendment significantly increased N uptake, rice grain yield, economic benefit and WP, especially under AWD. In the two years, integration of 10\u2009t Z ha -1  with either AWD or CF management reduced NH 3  volatilization without increasing N leaching and increased rice grain yield and WP, with an increased economic benefit of $126\u2009\u2212\u2009195\u2009ha -1 , as compared to conventional management (CF without Z). The use of zeolite merits further investigation for application in the rice production systems.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing frequency of marine development activities and local wars at sea, the incidence of scald burns in marine accidents or wars has been increasing yearly. Various studies have indicated that immersion in seawater has a systemic impact on some organs of animals or humans with burn. Thus, for burn/scald injuries after immersion in seawater, it is desirable to study the effects and mechanisms of action on important organs. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of immersion in seawater on lung injury, inflammatory and oxidative-stress responses in scalded rats. The structural damage to lungs was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining and the results showed that seawater immersion aggravated structural lung injury in scalded rats. The expression of HMGB1 in lung tissues was detected by immunohistochemical analysis and the results showed that seawater immersion increased HMGB1 expression in lung tissues of scalded rats. Apoptosis in lung tissues was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and the results showed that seawater immersion increased apoptosis rate in lung tissues of scalded rats. In addition, the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, SOD, and MDA in serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and the results showed that seawater immersion induced secretion of proinflammatory factors (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8), increased MDA protein level, and suppressed SOD activity in the serum of scalded rats. Furthermore, measurement of plasma volume and pH showed that seawater immersion decreased plasma volume and pH value. Overall, the results indicated that all effects induced by immersion in seawater in scalded rats are more pronounced than those induced by freshwater. In conclusion, seawater immersion may aggravate lung injury and enhance inflammatory and oxidative-stress responses after burn.",

The rats in sham operation group and model group were gavaged with normal saline; the rats in Alendronate group were gavaged with the Alendronate at the dose of 1 mg\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9 and the rats in Er-xian decoction group were gavaged with Er-xian decoction at the dose of 8 g\u2022kg\u207b\u00b9, once a day for continuous 90 days. Then the femoral bone mineral density (BMD) was detected. The femoral bone proteins were detected by NanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap system, identified by Protein Discovery software, and the intensity of differentially expressed proteins were quantitated by SIEVE software. The results showed that Er-xian decoction could significantly improve femoral BMD in ovariectomized rats. As compared with model group, 41 differentially expressed proteins whose variation trend was consistent with the sham operation group, were found in Er-xian decoction group, mainly including biological oxidation related protein, signal transduction pathway related protein, proteins involved in aliphatic acid metabolism, cytoskeleton related protein, proteins involved in energy metabolism, and proteins involved in glucose metabolism etc. The osteoporosis could be prevented and cured by Er-xian decoction.

One dimensional transient temperature, energy and exergy models have been developed. Three different porous media materials have been used in the simulation. Findings show that solar pond with cinders gains the highest LCZ temperature and gets the maximum energy and exergy efficiency which are 32.62% and 20.70% respectively, and the lowest one is the case with marbles which are 29.72% and 16.62%. The results indicate that adding porous media with low volume heat capacity and low heat diffusivity to LCZ is beneficial to reach a higher temperature, and high temperature, high volume heat capacity and low thermal diffusivity of the porous media are both positive effect to the solar pond\u2019s energy and exergy storage. Experimental study shows that the numerical energy and exergetic efficiency are both a little higher than experimental ones, and the same temperature difference leads to a bigger exergy difference than energy.",

The influence of the food initial temperature on the temperature distribution of the heat storage layer has been investigated. The results show that adding phase-change heat storage layer (\u03c640 mm/80 mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009770 mm) makes the oven inner wall temperature 30\u00b0C\u201380\u00b0C higher than that without phase-change heat storage layer when the oven cavity temperature is at a constant of 100\u00b0C; and the oven inner wall temperature fluctuation caused by sunshine is obviously reduced from 100\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C\u201335\u00b0C.

The characterization results indicate that the water treatment during preparation process is in favor of the formation of pore structure, enhancing light-harvest ability and suppressing the recombination of the photoexcited electron-hole pair. The as-prepared g-C 3 N 4  catalyst was applied in the photocatalytic selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). The effects of incident wavelength, solvent, reaction time and scavenger on the photocatalytic performance were investigated. The results indicate that  O 2  \u2212  plays a key role as dominant active species in photocatalytic oxidation of 5-HMF. Compared with visible light, the UV light illumination is easier to cause the overoxidation of target product and thus leads to a lower DFF selectivity. Under the irradiation of light with wavelength u003e400\u00a0nm, the highest DFF selectivity of 85.6% can be achieved with HMF conversion of 31.2% in the presence of O 2 .",

Besides micropores originating from the elimination of some small molecular substances, the template effects of nano-CaO and nano-Na2CO3 particles (the intermediate products derived from EDTANa2Ca) created some meso/macropores, resulting in a developed hierarchical porous structure. As the pyrolysis temperature increases from 600 \u00b0C to 850 \u00b0C, the nitrogen content decreases from 10.8 at% to 1.48 at%, whereas both the BET surface area and the pore volume increase dramatically. The BET surface area and pore volume of the carbon prepared at 850 \u00b0C reach as high as 2015 m2 g\u22121 and 1.74 cm3 g\u22121, respectively, and the meso/macropores account for about 70% of the total pore volume.

        "abstract": "An in situ hard template strategy coupled with NaOH activation is proposed to prepare hierarchical porous carbons with high surface area from biomass for high-performance supercapacitors. The preparation of the carbon includes the sol\u2013gel process of lotus seed shell and sodium phytate, followed by carbonization and NaOH activation. The soluble sodium phytate is pyrolyzed to nano-Na5P3O10 during carbonization and then reacts with NaOH to convert to nano-Na2CO3 and nano-Na3PO4 particles, which are encapsulated in the carbon matrix as the in situ hard templates and leave large mesopores/macropores after being removed in the subsequent washing treatment. Combined with the micropores created by NaOH activation, the as-prepared carbons possess developed hierarchical pores with a large surface area of 3188 m2 g\u20131 and a pore volume of 3.2 cm3 g\u20131. Furthermore, the carbons are rich in the heteroatoms of O, N, and P originated from the biomass precursors and sodium phytate. As a result, the biomass-derived hierarch...",

In order to explore the mechanism underlying the different fragrances, the floral scents of  'Sibeia', with a strong fragrance, and  'Novano', with a very faint fragrance, were collected  using a dynamic headspace technique. These scents were identified using automated thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (ATD-GC/MS) at different flowering stages. We used RNA-Seq technique to determine the petal transcriptome at the full-bloom stage and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to investigate the molecular mechanism of floral scent biosynthesis. The results showed that a significantly higher amount of  'Siberia' floral scent was released compared with  'Novano'. Moreover, monoterpenes played a dominant role in the floral scent of  'Siberia'; therefore, it is believed that the different emissions of monoterpenes mainly contributed to the difference in the floral scent between the two  genotypes. Transcriptome sequencing analysis indicated that ~29.24 Gb of raw data were generated and assembled into 124,233 unigenes, of which 35,749 unigenes were annotated. Through a comparison of gene expression between these two  genotypes, 6,496 DEGs were identified. The genes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway showed significantly different expression levels.

In the South Qilian belt, amphibolites from the Hualong Complex can be subdivided into four types based on their lithologies, ages, and tectonic affinities. Type I is characterized by garnet and Proterozoic detrital zircons, indicating a metasedimentary origin. Type II and IV amphibolites are tholeiitic and calc-alkaline, respectively, and characterized by enrichment in LREES, Th, U, and Ba, accompanied by depletion in Nb and Ta, indicating a continental arc setting on an active continental margin. Type III is alkaline with ocean island basalt affinity and considered to have intraplate, rift-related origins.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Volcanic rocks in the southern part of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ), eastern China, provide key evidence for the connection between spatially and temporally related pulses of Cretaceous magmatism, activity on the TLFZ, and the dynamics of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. We identify two stages of bimodal volcanism in the Chaohu\u2013Lujiang segment, southern TLFZ, based on lithological assemblages and precise isotopic ages. The Early Cretaceous (125\u2013121\u202fMa) volcanic rocks are fractionated aluminous A-type rhyolites and basalts, whereas the Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks (97\u201383\u202fMa) range in composition from porphyritic andesites and trachydacites to rhyolites. The Early Cretaceous rhyolites display strongly negative Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (e Nd ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221216.3 to \u221216.1, e Hf ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221224.1 to \u221217.9). The most likely source rocks of the fractionated aluminous A-type rhyolites are metaigneous rocks of the Feidong Complex. The Early Cretaceous potassic basalts (K 2 O/Na 2 O\u202f=\u202f1.5\u20133.4, e Nd ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u22129.0) exhibit more enriched isotopic compositions than the Late Cretaceous sodic porphyritic andesites (K 2 O/Na 2 O\u202f=\u202f0.6\u20130.8, e Nd ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u22125.6, e Hf ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221215.1 to \u22126.8), indicating derivation from heterogeneously enriched lithospheric mantle. This heterogeneity is ascribed to derivation from more fertile and isotopically enriched mantle sources with lower solidus temperatures. Modeling of selected elements reveals that the Late Cretaceous trachydacites (e Nd ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221212.2 to \u22128.2, e Hf ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221216.5 to \u22126.4) originated by mixing between coeval mafic and felsic magmas. The most negative (e Nd ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221218.8 to \u221217.1, e Hf ( t )\u202f=\u202f\u221220.5 to \u22124.7) isotopic compositions, along with Neoproterozoic inherited zircons within the Late Cretaceous rhyolites, indicate derivation from lower crust of the South China Block. We suggest that the Early Cretaceous bimodal volcanic rocks formed in an extensional backarc setting induced by retreat of the subducting Izanagi slab. However, the TLFZ became a focus of Late Cretaceous bimodal volcanism due to weak far-field extension caused by the slow northward motion of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Moreover, the high velocity and low angle of subduction of the Izanagi slab were the main driving mechanisms behind an Early Cretaceous transpressional event that separated the two stages of bimodal volcanism.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A strong and tough self-healing elastomer is prepared based on double reversible networks consisting of ionic interactions and Diels-Alder (D-A) crosslinks. The elastomer is synthesized through one-pot copolymerization of a pair of oppositely charged monomers and furan functionalized methacrylate (FMA), which is then crosslinked with 1,1u0027-(Methylenebis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) (BMI) via Diels-Alder (D-A) reaction. The oppositely charged monomers form ionic bonds which can segregate into aggregates with a wide distribution of size. Under heating or external force, the aggregates can dissociate from small to big ones to dissipate amount of energy and endow the materials with high mechanical properties (13\u202fMPa in strength, 480% in stretchability). While the D-A crosslinks act as covalent bonds at room temperature and endow the materials with high elasticity and fast shape recovery ability. These two reversible networks with different dynamics contribute to the multi-scale self-healing properties of the elastomer. As a result, the self-healing efficiency of the elastomer is as high as 86%.",

        "abstract": "A huge challenge for developing self-healing elastomers is achieving a compromise between mechanical properties and healing efficiency. Here, we report a class of high performance self-healing elastomers (HiSHEs) with an exceptional combination of strength (up to 30 MPa), toughness (up to 32 kJ m\u22122) and healing efficiency (u003e80%). The HiSHEs are made of polyampholytes synthesized through kinetically controlled copolymerization of an acrylate monomer with long alkyl side groups and a pair of oppositely charged monomers that forms precipitates slowly. The acrylate monomer enables the formation of polymer chains of high mobility, while the oppositely charged monomers form gradient interactions by segregating into ionic aggregates with a wide range of sizes and stiffnesses. The weak interactions sacrifice progressively to dissipate energy, thereby enhancing the toughness, and the strong interactions impart the elastomers with high strength and elasticity. Moreover, the reversible gradient interactions also enable self-healing and multi-shape memory functions. By harnessing these functions, we design a mendable strain sensor with remarkably improved sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "To mimic the velocity-sensitive ability of human skin, we fabricate a class of \"solid-liquid\" elastomers (SLEs) by interpenetrating polyborosiloxane (PBS) with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). PBS forms a dynamic network through boron/oxygen dative bonds, while PDMS is covalently crosslinked to form a permanent network. The permanent network affords a scaffold for the dynamic network, imparting SLEs with high elasticity and structural stability, thereby overcoming the inherent drawbacks such as fluidity and irreversible deformation of conventional solid-liquid materials. Meanwhile, the dissociation and association of dynamic network is time dependent. Thus, the modulus of SLEs varies with strain rates, and if the SLEs contain carbon nanotubes their electric conductivity is also responsive to strain rates. This property can be utilized to fabricate skin-like sensors with the ability to distinguish different contact velocity. Moreover, the dynamic network can dissipate energy and be repaired, leading to the high stretchability and self-healing performance of SLEs.",

Based on this, two kinds of copolymers with host\u2013guest interaction based on modified \u03b2-cyclodextrin and hydrophobic twin-tail structures, which are expected to be alternatives to currently used copolymers in the oil field, were successfully synthesized via free-radical copolymerization in this study. Subsequently, the copolymers were characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, SEM and TG-DTG to confirm that they were prepared successfully and exhibited favorable thermal stability. Furthermore, the copolymers could enormously increase the viscosity of the aqueous solution compared with partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. And static experiments have convincingly proved that the \u03b2-cyclodextrin and twin-tail structure endowed the copolymers with excellent shear resistance, temperature resistance, salt tolerance, and viscoelasticity. Core flooding experiments further indicated that this unique type of host\u2013guest interaction can make the copolymers have great potential for enhanced oil recovery.",

        "abstract": "The poly (glycidyl methacrylate-co-poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate) monoliths modified with gold nanoparticles, with advantages of enhanced reactive sites, good hydrophilicity and facile modification, were prepared as the matrix, followed by variable functionalization with cysteine and PNGase F for glycopeptide enrichment and on-line deglycosylation respectively. By the cysteine functionalized monolithic column, glycopeptides could be efficiently and selectively enriched with good reproducibility based on hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Furthermore, the enrichment was specially achieved in weak alkaline environment, with 10 mM NH4HCO3 as the elution buffer, compatible with deglycosylation conditions. Therefore, the glycopeptides could be on-line deglycosylated with high efficiency and throughput by directly coupling the PNGase F functionalized monolithic column with the enrichment column during elution without the requirement of buffer exchange and pH adjustment. By such a method, within only 70-min pretreatment, 196 N-linked glycopeptides, corresponding to 122 glycoproteins, could be identified from 5 \u03bcg of human plasma with 14 high-abundant proteins removed, and the N-linked glycopeptides occupied 81% of all identified peptides, achieving to the best of our knowledge, the highest selectivity of HILIC-based methods. All the results demonstrated the high efficiency, selectivity and throughput of our proposed strategy for the large scale glycoproteome analysis.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to establish whether isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (Iars) regulates the differentiation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) during the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In addition, the contribution of various signaling pathways towards this process was ascertained. The study demonstrated that the expression of Iars, p-p38, osteopontin (OPN) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) clearly increased, while levels of p-PI3K and smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM22\u03b1) decreased significantly in AAA tissues. Inhibition of Iars significantly reduced the incidence of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAA in mice, coincident with decreased activity of the p38 MAPK pathway and increased PI3K pathway activity. AngII-induced phenotypic switching and apoptosis of VSMCs decreased following the inhibition of Iars in vitro. Upregulation of the IARS gene induced phenotypic switching and apoptosis in VSMCs in addition to increased p38 MAPK pathway activation and reduced PI3K pathway activation. Following pretreatment with an activator of the PI3K pathway, expression of Iars and the phenotypic markers of VSMCs were not affected, while apoptosis of VSMCs decreased. Similarly, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway in VSMCs did not affect the expression of Iars or the degree of cell apoptosis, but reduced phenotypic switching was observed. Conclusively, upregulation of Iars regulates the phenotypic switching and apoptosis of VSMCs. Targeting Iars may be a promising strategy to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm.",

        "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is a crucial biological process related to cell proliferation, redox balance, and muscle contractility. Aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) show inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis, along with high levels of oxidative stress in aortic dissection (AD). Theoretically, ribosome biogenesis should be enhanced in the ASMCs at its proliferative state but suppressed during apoptosis and oxidative stress. However, the exact status and role of ribosome biogenesis in AD are unknown. We therefore analyzed the expression levels of BOP1, a component of the PeBoW complex which is crucial to ribosome biogenesis, in AD patients and a murine AD model and its influence on the ASMCs. BOP1 was downregulated in the aortic tissues of AD patients compared to healthy donors. In addition, overexpression of BOP1 in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) inhibited apoptosis and accumulation of p53 under hypoxic conditions, while knockdown of BOP1 decreased the protein synthesis rate and motility of HASMCs. The RNA polymerase I inhibitor cx-5461 induced apoptosis, ROS production, and proliferative inhibition in the HASMCs, which was partly attenuated by p53 knockout. Furthermore, cx-5461 aggravated the severity of AD , but a p53-/- background extended the life-span and lowered AD incidence in the mice. Taken together, decreased ribosome biogenesis in ASMCs resulting in p53-dependent proliferative inhibition, oxidative stress, and apoptosis is one of the underlying mechanisms of AD.",

        "abstract": "The development of a highly specific recognition system for glycoprotein capture from complex biological samples is a prerequisite to the success of mass spectra-based glycoproteomics analysis. To achieve this purpose, a one-pot precipitation polymerization (PP) strategy with a novel solvent system composed of water/ethanol (4:1, v/v) is described for preparing boronate-affinity polymeric micro/nano particles using 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (VPBA) as the functional monomer and N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBA) alone or together with divinylbenzene (DVB) as the cross-linker(s). The proposed polymerization strategy not only affords monodisperse polymeric submicrometer particles with a smooth surface and controllable size, ranging from 300 to 700 nm, but also increases the loading capacity of boronic acid, which could hardly be achieved by other polymerization methods, thus leading to the specific recognition of glycoproteins. The effects of solvent systems and monomers on the morphology and boronate-affinity capacity of prepared materials were further investigated based on the Flory-Huggins model. It was proved that the reaction rate of various monomers during particle formation might be the key factor affecting the affinity capacity for glycoproteins. Our results demonstrated that under the theoretical guidance of the Flory-Huggins model the PP strategy with a selected monomer and solvent system might provide a good approach to prepare submicrometer polymer particles with plenty of boronic acid groups on the surface to achieve a highly selective enrichment of glycoproteins.",

However, irreproducible precursor ion selection caused by data dependent acquisition and the chromatographic shift caused by isotope effects limit the wide application of this method. Herein, we expand the use of pseudo IPTL to SWATH MS application and develop a novel quantitative strategy, termed SWATH-pseudo-IPTL, by which the relative quantification could be achieved by comparing the \"complete\" extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) intensity of MS/MS scan instead of a single intensity measurement in DDA-pseudo-IPTL which only reflected the peptide abundances at that given time. The quantitative analysis of various proportions of mixed HeLa samples revealed the strong accuracy and precision of our SWATH-pseudo-IPTL method, both of which were better than that of the DDA-pseudo-IPTL strategy. SWATH-pseudo-IPTL was also applied to the quantitative profiling of the proteome from human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with high and low metastatic potential, and most of the differentially expressed proteins were related to tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis, demonstrating the feasibility of this methodology for biological applications.

        "abstract": "Because of the low abundance of glycopeptide in natural biological samples, methods for efficient and selective enrichment of glycopeptides play a significant role in mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycoproteomics. In this study, a novel kind of zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction chromatography polymer particles, namely, poly(N,N-methylenebisacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid)@l-Cys (poly(MBAAm-co-MAA)@l-Cys), for the enrichment of glycopeptides was synthesized by a facile and efficient approach that combined distillation precipitation polymerization (DPP) and \"thiol-ene\" click reaction. In the DPP approach, residual vinyl groups explored outside the core with high density, then the functional ligand cysteine was immobilized onto the surface of core particles by highly efficient thiol-ene click reaction. Taking advantage of the unique structure of poly(MBAAm-co-MAA)@l-Cys, the resulting particles possess remarkable enrichment selectivity for glycopeptides from the tryptic digested human immunoglobulin G. The polymer particles were successfully employed for the analysis of human plasma, and 208 unique glycopeptides corresponding to 121 glycoproteins were reliably identified in triple independent nano-LC-MS/MS runs. The selectivity toward glycopeptides of these particles poly(MBAAm-co-MAA)@l-Cys is \u223c2 times than that of the commercial beads. These results demonstrated that these particles had great potential for large-scale glycoproteomics research. Moreover, the strategy with the combination of DPP and thiol-ene click chemistry might be a facile method to produce functional polymer particles for bioenrichment application. ",

For imFASP method, proteins dissolved in 8\u00a0M urea were loaded onto a filter device with molecular weight cut off (MWCO) as 10\u00a0kDa, followed by in-situ protein preconcentration, denaturation, reduction, alkylation, and microwave-assisted tryptic digestion. Compared with traditional in-solution sample preparation method, imFASP method generated more protein and peptide identifications (IDs) from preparation of 45\u00a0\u03bcg  Escherichia coli  protein sample due to the higher efficiency, and the sample preparation throughput was significantly improved by 14 times (1\u00a0h vs. 15\u00a0h). More importantly, when the starting amounts of  E.\u00a0coli  cell lysate decreased to nanogram level (50\u2013500\u00a0ng), the protein and peptide identified by imFASP method were improved at least 30% and 44%, compared with traditional in-solution preparation method, suggesting dramatically higher peptide recovery of imFASP method for trace amounts of complex proteome samples. All these results demonstrate that the imFASP method developed here is of high potential for high efficient and high throughput preparation of trace amounts of complex proteome samples.",

        "abstract": "The choroid plexus epithelium within the brain ventricles secretes the majority of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The luminal Na,K-ATPase acts in concert with a host of other transport proteins to mediate efficient fluid secretion across the epithelium. The CSF contains little protein buffer, but the pH value seems nonetheless maintained within narrow limits, even when faced with acid/base challenges. The involvement of choroid plexus acid/base transporters in CSF pH regulation is highlighted by the expression of several acid/base transporters in the epithelium. The aim of the current study was to identify novel acid/base transporters expressed in the luminal membrane of the choroid plexus epithelium to pave the way for systematic investigations of each candidate transporter in the regulation of CSF pH. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins from epithelial cells isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting identified the Cl/H exchangers ClC-3, -4, -5, and -7 in addition to known choroid plexus acid/base transporters. RT-PCR on FACS isolated epithelial cells confirmed the expression of the corresponding mRNAs, as well as NHE6 mRNA. Both NHE6 and ClC-7 were immunolocalized to the luminal plasma membrane domain of the choroid plexus epithelial cells. Dynamic imaging of intracellular pH and membrane potential changes in isolated choroid plexus epithelial cells demonstrated Cl gradient-driven changes in intracellular pH and membrane potential that are consistent with Cl/H exchange. In conclusion, we have detected for the first time NHE6 and ClC-7 in the choroid plexus, which are potentially involved in pH regulation of the CSF.",

State-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based methods possess the capability, on a proteome scale and in an unbiased manner, to detect alterations in protein abundances and/or post-translational modifications in plasma, urine or tissue. Such approaches can provide a large unbiased database to facilitate identification of potential biomarkers. In the diagnosis of kidney diseases, urine is usually a more favorable specimen than plasma and kidney tissue due to its non-invasive collection and simplicity of processing. However, whether analysis of proteins in urine faithfully reflects their changes in the kidney tissue remains unclear. The use of proteomics to analyze kidney tissue samples collected during late-stage kidney diseases has also recently gathered pace. The goal of this mini-review is to provide an overview of the proteomic technologies currently applied to studies of kidney and their limitations, present existing kidney and urine proteome databases, and highlight a few applications of such approaches in kidney disease biomarker discovery.",

        "abstract": "In normal individuals, the epithelium of the colon absorbs 1.5-2\u2009l of water a day to generate dehydrated feces. However, in the condition of bile acid malabsorption (BAM), an excess of bile acids in the colon results in diarrhea. Several studies have attempted to address the mechanisms contributing to BAM induced by various bile acids. However, none have addressed a potential dysregulation of aquaporin (AQP) water channels, which are responsible for the majority of transcellular water transport in epithelial cells, as a contributing factor to the onset of diarrhea and the pathogenesis of BAM. In this study, we aimed to systematically analyze the expression of AQPs in colonic epithelia from rat, mouse, and human and determine whether their expression is altered in a rat model of BAM. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, RT-PCR, and western blotting identified various AQPs in isolated colonic epithelial cells from rats (AQP1, 3, 4, 7, 8) and mice (AQP1, 4, 8). Several AQPs were also detected in human colon (AQP1, 3, 4, 7-9). Immunohistochemistry localized AQP1 to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells in the bottom of the crypts, whereas AQP3 (rat, human) and AQP4 (mice, human) were localized predominantly in the basolateral plasma membrane. AQP8 was localized intracellularly and at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. Rats fed sodium cholate for 72\u2009h had significantly increased fecal water content, suggesting development of BAM-associated diarrhea. Colonic epithelial cells isolated from this model had significantly altered levels of AQP3, 7, and 8, suggesting that these AQPs may be involved in the pathogenesis of bile acid-induced diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "Abstract To broaden the narrow gene base of the cultivated peanut and utilize sources of resistance to abiotic/biotic stresses, quality-related traits and high yielding factors, much attention has been paid to wild relatives of the oilseed crop since 1980s. Species outside section Arachis are cross-incompatible with A. hypogaea L.; even some of the species from section Arachis, which are supposed to be compatible, may also encounter obstacles when crossed with the peanut cultigen. The objective of the present communication is to study the effects of simple hormone treatment on production of true incompatible hybrids in peanut to replace the tedious and lengthy in vitro embryo rescue procedures currently in use. In the incompatible cross, A. hypogaea cv Qunyu 101 \u00d7 A. paraguariensis, post-pollination application of a hormone aqueous solution (IAA 4 mg/L + GA 2 mg/L) at flower bases resulted in 42 seeds, of which 26 were identified as true hybrids by allele-specific PCR for FAD2A genotyping. As a desirable alternative to in vitro embryo/ovules/peg culture, the present method may facilitate the utilization of wild species in peanut breeding. The method described here for peanut may be of reference to other crop plants where embryo abortion is also a problem.",

        "abstract": "As compared with its normal oleate counterpart, high oleate peanuts have better storage quality and several health benefits, and are therefore preferred by peanut shellers and consumers. High oleate has now become one of the main breeding objectives of peanuts. Thus far, over 50 high oleate peanut cultivars have been registered. Yet high oleate peanut breeding relies heavily on a limited number of high oleate genotypes. In this paper, we reported, for the first time, high peanut oleate natural mutants with large seeds derived from an intersectional cross, which were identified with near infra-red spectroscopy and confirmed by gas chromatography. Sequencing of  FAD2  from the high-oleic hybrids along with their normal oleate parents indicated that a 448G u003eA mutation in  FAD2A  coupled with a 441_442ins A or G in  FAD2B  together caused high oleate phenotypes in these peanut hybrids.",

Inspired by this measurement, we propose to study the radiative decays of \\(h_c\\) via intermediate charmed meson loops in an effective Lagrangian approach. With the acceptable cutoff parameter range, the calculated branching ratios of \\(h_c(1P)\\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta \\) and \\(\\gamma \\eta ^\\prime \\) are of the orders of \\(10^{-4}\\) to \\(10^{-3}\\) and \\(10^{-3}\\) to \\(10^{-2}\\), respectively. The ratio \\(R_{h_c}= \\mathcal {B}( h_c\\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta )/\\mathcal {B}( h_c\\rightarrow \\gamma \\eta ^\\prime )\\) can reproduce the experimental measurements with the commonly acceptable \\(\\alpha \\) range. This ratio provide us with some information on the \\(\\eta \\)\u2013\\(\\eta ^\\prime \\) mixing, which may be helpful for us to test the SU(3)-flavor symmetries in QCD.",

        "abstract": "A critical challenge in extended-wear contact lenses is enhancing oxygen permeability. Insufficiency of oxygen results in hypoxia and potential damage to the cornea, with the possibility of occurrence increasing when lenses are worn for longer periods of time. Previous studies indicated the possibility of producing hyper-oxygen permeability in silicone films by incorporating hollow structures. For use in contact lenses, it is necessary to provide transparency and dispersible oxygen permeation-enhancing hollow silicone nanoparticles in hydrogels. This study demonstrates the preparation of hollow silicone nanoparticles with average diameter smaller than 100\u00a0nm and functionality to allow dispersion in aqueous solutions. Process modifications of a literature precedent are defined to achieve particles of desired size and morphology. Nanoparticles are analyzed by FTIR, dynamic light scattering, TEM and atomic force microscopy. Shell functionality provides a platform for further reaction and incorporation in hydrogel solutions.",

        "abstract": "Site-specific recognition of duplex DNA by triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) provides a promising approach to manipulate mammalian genomes. A prerequisite for successful gene targeting using this approach is that the targeted gene must contain specific, high-affinity TFO target sequences (TTS). To date, TTS have been identified and characterized in only approximately 37 human or rodent genes, limiting the application of triplex-directed gene targeting. We searched the complete human and mouse genomes using an algorithm designed to identify high-affinity TTS. The resulting data set contains 1.9 million potential TTS for each species. We found that 97.8% of known human and 95.2% of known mouse genes have at least one potential high-affinity TTS in the promoter and/or transcribed gene regions. Importantly, 86.5% of known human and 83% of the known mouse genes have at least one TTS that is unique to that gene. Thus, it is possible to target the majority of human and mouse genes with specific TFOs. We found substantially more potential TTS in the promoter sequences than in the transcribed gene sequences or intergenic sequences in both genomes. We selected 12 mouse genes and 2 human genes critical for cell signaling, proliferation, and/or carcinogenesis, identified potential TTS in each, and determined TFO binding affinities to these sites in vitro. We identified at least one high-affinity, specific TFO binding site within each of these genes. Using this information, many genes involved in mammalian cell proliferation and carcinogenesis can now be targeted.",

Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind to their target sites in duplex DNA, thereby forming triple-helical DNA structures via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. TFO binding has been demonstrated to site-specifically inhibit gene expression, enhance homologous recombination, induce mutation, inhibit protein binding, and direct DNA damage, thus providing a tool for gene-specific manipulation of DNA. We have developed a flexible web-based search engine to find and annotate TFO target sequences within the human and mouse genomes. Descriptive information about each site, including sequence context and gene region (intron, exon, or promoter), is provided. The engine assists the user in finding highly specific TFO target sequences by eliminating or flagging known repeat sequences and flagging overlapping genes. A convenient way to check for the uniqueness of a potential TFO binding site is provided via NCBI BLAST. The search engine may be accessed at spi.mdanderson.org/tfo.",

Photoreactive molecules have been conjugated to TFOs to direct sequence-specific damage in double-stranded DNA. However, the photoproducts are often repaired efficiently in cells. This limitation has led to the search for sequence-specific photoreactive reagents that can produce more genotoxic lesions. Here we demonstrate that photoactivated pyrene-conjugated TFOs (pyr-TFOs) induce DNA strand breaks near the pyrene moiety with remarkably high efficiency and also produce covalent pyrene-DNA adducts. Free radical scavenging experiments demonstrated a role for singlet oxygen activated by the singlet excited state of pyrene in the mechanism of pyr-TFO-induced DNA damage. In cultured mammalian cells, the effect of photoactivated pyr-TFO-directed DNA damage was to induce mutations, in the form of deletions, approximately 7-fold over background levels, at the targeted site. Thus, pyr-TFOs represent a potentially powerful new tool for directing DNA strand breaks to specific chromosomal locations for biotechnological and potential clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "We consider a two-period sourcing and production problem. First, a firm (OEM) sources from multiple suppliers who have limited capacity and correlated disruption risk. After the supply is realized, the firm also has access to the spot market for the extra material needed for its production. The firm must decide (1) which suppliers to source from, (2) how much to source from them, and (3) how much to produce and how much to source from the spot market. We formulate this as a stochastic optimization problem to study the tradeoff the firm faces between costs and default risk. In order to incorporate the correlation of the supplier\u2019s default risk, we use the t-copula dependence structure. A contract default is a rare event. Thus, in a Monte Carlo simulation, there is considerable variance around the optimal sourcing quantity. This variance leads to complexity in computing the optimal decision. We find that a diligent combination of importance sampling and conditional Monte Carlo schemes effectively reduces the variance in simulation estimates for the first-order conditions in the stochastic optimization problem. This paper shows that, for a supply chain with correlated default risks, the optimal sourcing problem can be solved by using importance sampling and a conditional Monte Carlo simulation.",

        "abstract": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis, mainly caused by osteoclast-induced bone resorption, has become a global public health burden. Natural compounds are emerging as potential therapeutics for postmenopausal osteoporosis. In vitro osteoclastogenesis assay was conducted to investigate the effect of Glycyrrhizic acid (Gly) on osteoclast differentiation without cytotoxity. We applied bone resorption pit assessment and F-actin immunofluoresence to explore the effect of Gly on osteoclasts function in vitro. RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the expression level of RANKL-induced osteoclast-specific gene. Western blotting was conducted for analyzing potential mechanisms of inhibitory influence of Gly on the formation and function of osteoclasts in vitro. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice model, micro-CT and histomorphometry was used to survey the potential effect of Gly on the resorption of bone in vivo. Gly inhibited osteoclast differentiation and function without significant cytotoxicity at a dose of no more than 8\u202fmM in vitro. Gly attenuated mRNA expression of osteoclast-specific genes including NFATc1, c-fos, TRAP, CTR, cathepsin K, and V-ATPase d2 in vitro. Gly inhibited degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, phosphorylation of ERK and JNK without disturbing phosphorylation of p38 after treating osteoclasts in vitro. In OVX mice, Gly attenuates osteoclast formation and preserves bone mass and trabecular structure. Gly can effectively inhibit osteoclast maturation and bone resorption by suppressing NF-\u03baB, ERK, and JNK pathway in vitro and exhibits an osteoprotective effect in OVX mice.",

        "abstract": "Plant roots are constantly exposed to a variety of abiotic stresses, and high salinity is one of the major limiting conditions that impose constraints on plant growth. In this study, we describe that OsMADS25 is required for the root growth as well as salinity tolerance, via maintaining ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpression of OsMADS25 remarkably enhanced the primary root (PR) length and lateral root (LR) density, whereas RNAi silence of this gene reduced PR elongation significantly, with altered ROS accumulation in the root tip. Transcriptional activation assays indicated that OsMADS25 activates OsGST4 (glutathione S-transferase) expression directly by binding to its promoter. Meanwhile, osgst4 mutant exhibited repressed growth and high sensitivity to salinity and oxidative stress, and recombinant OsGST4 protein was found to have ROS-scavenging activity in vitro. Expectedly, overexpression of OsMADS25 significantly enhanced the tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress in rice plants, with the elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased accumulation of osmoprotective solute proline and reduced frequency of open stoma. Furthermore, OsMADS25 specifically activated the transcription of OsP5CR, a key component of proline biosynthesis, by binding to its promoter. Interestingly, overexpression of OsMADS25 raised the root sensitivity to exogenous ABA, and the expression of ABA-dependent stress-responsive genes was elevated greatly in overexpression plants under salinity stress. In addition, OsMADS25 seemed to promote auxin signaling by activating OsYUC4 transcription. Taken together, our findings reveal that OsMADS25 might be an important transcriptional regulator that regulates the root growth and confers salinity tolerance in rice via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.",

        "abstract": "OsMADS27 is one of the ANR1-like homologues in rice, whreas its functions in plant growth and development as well as the abiotic stress responses remain unclear. Here we investigated the roles of OsMADS27 in the root development in response to NO- availability. Constitutive expression of OsMADS27 significantly inhibited the elongation of primary root (PR), but enhanced lateral root (LR) formation in a NO--dependent manner. Furthermore, OsMADS27 overexpression promoted NO- accumulation as well as the expression of NO- transporter genes. ABA is reported to play an important role in mediating the effects of NO- on the root development, thus it is supposed that OsMADS27 might regulate the root growth and development by ABA pathway. The root growth and development in OsMADS27 overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type. Moreover, under NO- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in OsMADS27 overexpression plants. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsMADS27 physically interacts with ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) via DELLA protein OsSLR1. More importantly, OsMADS27 overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance. Taken together, our findings suggested that OsMADS27 is an important regulator controlling the root system development and adaption to osmotic stress in rice.",

In this work, a novel algorithm is developed to detect seizures employing log-Euclidean Gaussian kernel-based sparse representation (SR) in long-term EEG recordings. Unlike the traditional SR for vector data in Euclidean space, the log-Euclidean Gaussian kernel-based SR framework is proposed for seizure detection in the space of the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, which form a Riemannian manifold. Since the Riemannian manifold is nonlinear, the log-Euclidean Gaussian kernel function is applied to embed it into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for performing SR. The EEG signals of all channels are divided into epochs and the SPD matrices representing EEG epochs are generated by covariance descriptors. Then, the testing samples are sparsely coded over the dictionary composed by training samples utilizing log-Euclidean Gaussian kernel-based SR. The classification of testing samples is achieved by computing the minimal reconstructed residuals. The proposed method is evaluated on the Freiburg EEG dataset of 21 patients and shows its notable performance on both epoch-based and event-based assessments. Moreover, this method handles multiple channels of EEG recordings synchronously which is more speedy and efficient than traditional seizure detection methods.",

        "abstract": "Automatic seizure detection has played an important role in the monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. In this paper, a patient specific method is proposed for seizure detection in the long-term intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. This seizure detection method is based on sparse representation with online dictionary learning and elastic net constraint. The online learned dictionary could sparsely represent the testing samples more accurately, and the elastic net constraint which combines the l1-norm and l2-norm not only makes the coefficients sparse but also avoids over-fitting problem. First, the EEG signals are preprocessed using wavelet filtering and differential filtering, and the kernel function is applied to make the samples closer to linearly separable. Then the dictionaries of seizure and nonseizure are respectively learned from original ictal and interictal training samples with online dictionary optimization algorithm to compose the training dictionary. After that, the test samples are sparsely coded over the learned dictionary and the residuals associated with ictal and interictal sub-dictionary are calculated, respectively. Eventually, the test samples are classified as two distinct categories, seizure or nonseizure, by comparing the reconstructed residuals. The average segment-based sensitivity of 95.45%, specificity of 99.08%, and event-based sensitivity of 94.44% with false detection rate of 0.23/h and average latency of -.14 s have been achieved with our proposed method.",

In this study, we describe an algorithm for motor imagery (MI) classification of electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based BCI. The proposed approach employs multi-resolution fractal measures and local binary pattern (LBP) operators to form a combined feature for characterizing an ECoG epoch recording from the right hemisphere of the brain. A classifier is trained by using the gradient boosting in conjunction with ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The fractal intercept, lacunarity and LBP features are extracted to classify imagined movements of either the left small finger or the tongue. Experimental results on dataset I of BCI competition III demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The cross-validation accuracy and accuracy is 90.6% and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, the low computational burden of this method makes it a promising candidate for real-time BCI systems. ",

This paper presents a novel seizure detection method using sparse representation-based Earth Mover's Distance (SR-EMD). In the proposed algorithm, wavelet decomposition is executed on the original EEG recordings with five scales, and the scales 3, 4 and 5 are selected to structure the distributions of EEG signals. Then, the Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of EEG signals are estimated and the distances between GMMs are computed using SR-EMD as EEG features. After that, EEG features are sent to Bayesian linear discriminant analysis classifier for classification. To improve the detection accuracy, the post-processing procedure is employed finally. The long-term intracranial EEG dataset with 21 patients is used to evaluate the performance of the method, and the satisfactory sensitivity of 93.54\u00a0%, specificity of 97.57\u00a0% and false detection rate of 0.223/h are achieved. The results indicate that SR-EMD is more effective and efficient than the conventional Earth Mover's Distance (EMD).

This paper shows the comprehensive analysis on the autocorrelation property of the chronological RSS samples in the same RSS sequence, and meanwhile presents the correlated RSS correction approach. Furthermore, the correlated RSS correction approach can also be integrated into the conventional radio-map based K nearest neighbor (KNN) and weighted KNN (WKNN) localization algorithms.

However, this province is facing various challenges due to its fast development. In order to promote its sustainable development, an emergy accounting approach was employed to evaluate its sustainability for the year 2014. Temporal analysis of emergy-based indicators was also conducted to provide a holistic picture of Yunnanu0027s economic performance. In addition, sensitivity analysis of dominant contributors was performed to improve the research reliability. Results show that the total emergy used for supporting Yunnanu0027s economy was 1.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 24  sej in 2014 and its economy highly relied on indigenous metals (45%) and minerals (23%), as well as fuels imported to Yunnan province (12%). Emergy-based indicators reflect that economy development in Yunnan province was highly dependent on the local ecosystem, far away from sustainable development. Policy recommendations were provided in order to improve its sustainable development, such as promoting circular economy, adjusting industrial structure, developing renewable energy based on local resource endowment, and promoting capacity-building activities.",

However, a substantial increase in the number of hydrological site, especially for the unmanned hydrometric station brought great difficulty and caused the more workload for the Hydrologists every year. With the development of sensor technology and the data acquisition and fusion applications, itu0027s important to build an embedded measurement and control system for the hydrological flow station. Therefore, in this paper we research and design a realtime embedded measurement and control system for the discharge measurement which can measure, store, communicate and calculate the river discharge automatically. The design of the intelligent Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is a key step in implementation of the real-time embedded measurement and control system. The design of RTU adopts the STM32F107 as a kernel controller and the software program based on a real-time embedded operation system. This system has high accuracy and high automation level which can greatly reduce the workload of the hydrologist and promote the development of water resources informatization construction. Hydrologists can benefit from this system.",

In order to evaluate its current sustainability and provide useful policy suggestions to improve its sustainable development, a systematic study on Qinghaiu0027s socio-economic system was conducted by applying emergy synthesis. Results show that the total emergy use for supporting Qinghaiu0027s economy was 5.13\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 24 \u202fsej in 2015. The values of emergy to money, emergy density, and emergy used per person are 2.12\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 13 \u202fsej/RMB, 7.11\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 12 \u202fsej/m 2 , and 8.72\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 17 \u202fsej/person, respectively. The holistic picture of Qinghaiu0027s socio-economic system is also uncovered based on the temporal analysis of emergy-based indicators. Results show that emergy yield ratio increased from 52.21 in 2002 to 164.10 in 2015. Similarly, the environmental loading ratio increased from 4.64 in 2002 to 57.99 in 2015. Correspondingly, the value of emergy-based sustainability index decreased from 11.25 in 2002 to 2.83 in 2015. These results indicate that Qinghai was highly dependent on local resources and its sustainability experienced a declining trend. In addition, the high absolute value of emergy to money ratio indicates that Qinghai was a net loser for its domestic and international trade. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the reliability of these results. Finally, policy recommendations based on such a systematic evaluation and local realities were proposed to improve its sustainable development.",

The catalysts and the hydrogenation products were analyzed by XRD, TEM, TG, FTIR, UV-Vis absorption, GC and GC-MS, respectively. Hydrogenation process was also optimized through varying the reaction parameters. The results demonstrate that Pd/CNT catalysts possess the highest hydrogenation efficiency, give the full conversion of BA and 100.0% selectivity towards CCA at the optimal hydrogenation conditions, by comparing with some commercial hydrogenation catalysts and Pd/C catalysts with commercial carbonaceous supports. The excellent hydrogenation performance of Pd/CNT is attributed to the stable crystalline CNT support and the high dispersion of Pd nanoparticles. In addition, the protic solvent is also beneficial to lower the activation energy barrier of BA hydrogenation, a...",

The multifaceted role of autophagy in cancer has been revealed in previous years. However, the mechanism of this role remains unknown. In the present study, the two most common free fatty acids, palmitate acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA), were used to determine the effect on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, and the possible role of autophagy was investigated by detecting light chain 3 (LC3)-II/I. Bafliomycin A1 was used to detect autophagy flux. High palmitate acid condition-induced MDA-MB-231 cell death and invasion were mitigated by 3-methyladenine pretreatment or transfection with shRNA against autophagy protein 5. By contrast, high oleic acid condition induced MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration and invasion were mitigated using rapamycin. The present results suggest that autophagy has an important role in the effects of PA and OA on breast cancer growth and metastasis .",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the differences in clinical and sonographic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) between cervical lymph node metastatic (CLNM) and nonmetastatic groups. Clinical data of PTC patients (414 patients with 624 malignant nodules) who underwent a preoperative ultrasonography and surgery between June 2010 and March 2015 at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical factors, preoperative ultrasound features and the final pathological findings were obtained. The differences in the sonographic features of PTC between the CLNM group and the non-CLNM group were analyzed. There were 187 CLNM and 227 non-CLNM patients. The median age at the diagnosis of this cohort was 45.4 years old (ranging from 18 to 77 years). Ultrasonographic parameters that were significantly associated with CLNM [OR=2.569 (1.502, 4.393), P<0.001)] were as follows: the mulifocality of the nodules, size over 2 cm, the presence of microcalcifications, the distance ratio (DR) pattern showing the contact of the nodules with the thyroid capsule, and the extracapsular spread of the nodules. No significant differences in age, gender, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and other ultrasonography parameters were found between the CLNM and the non-CLNM groups. Therefore, our results suggest that a larger size, microcalcifications, mulifocality, and the DR pattern showing the contact of the nodules with the thyroid capsule and extracapsular spread are significantly more indicative of CLNM in PTC.",

        "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer (CP/PC) is characterized by fibrous connective tissue proliferation induced by activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Galectin-1 is upregulated in activated PSCs and is important for the continuing activation of PSCs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of galectin-1 derived from activated PSCs on the progression of fibrosis in CP/PC. To this end, the expression of desmin, \u03b1-SMA, galectin-1, fibronectin and collagen type\u00a0I in normal pancreatic, CP and PC tissues, as well as quiescent/activated PSCs, was investigated. The proliferation rate and migration ability of control, galectin-1-overexpressing and galectin-1-silenced PSCs were also evaluated, as well as the mRNA and protein expression of fibronectin, collagen type\u00a0I, \u03b1-SMA, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, MMP-2, Smad2 and TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, the effect of adding a TGF-\u03b21 receptor inhibitor on the expression of these proteins was examined. The results revealed that the expression profile of desmin, \u03b1-SMA, galectin-1, fibronectin and collagen type\u00a0I in the normal pancreas was similar to that of quiescent PSCs and the expression profile in CP/PC tissues was similar to that of activated PSCs. Furthermore, galectin-1-overexpressing PSCs exhibited a significantly higher proliferation rate and migration ability, while galectin-1-silenced PSCs exhibited a significantly lower proliferation rate and migration ability than the control PSCs. The expression of fibronectin, collagen type\u00a0I, \u03b1-SMA, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 was also significantly higher in the galectin-1-overexpressing PSCs than the control PSCs and this effect was found to be mediated by the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway. The trends in the expression of these factors were reversed in the galectin-1-silenced PSCs. From these findings, it can be concluded that overexpression of galectin-1 promotes PSC activity (proliferation and migration) and stimulates fibrosis by increasing extracellular matrix synthesis and decreasing the MMP/TIMP ratio via the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway. Thus, galectin-1 may be a novel candidate for reversing or halting fibrosis progression in CP/PC.",

        "abstract": "DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are among the most toxic types of damage to a cell. For this reason, many ICL-inducing agents are effective therapeutic agents. For example, cisplatin and nitrogen mustards are used for treating cancer and psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is useful for treating psoriasis. However, repair mechanisms for ICLs in the human genome are not clearly defined. Previously, we have shown that MSH2, the common subunit of the human MutSalpha and MutSbeta mismatch recognition complexes, plays a role in the error-free repair of psoralen ICLs. We hypothesized that MLH1, the common subunit of human MutL complexes, is also involved in the cellular response to psoralen ICLs. Surprisingly, we instead found that MLH1-deficient human cells are more resistant to psoralen ICLs, in contrast to the sensitivity to these lesions displayed by MSH2-deficient cells. Apoptosis was not as efficiently induced by psoralen ICLs in MLH1-deficient cells as in MLH1-proficient cells as determined by caspase-3/7 activity and binding of annexin V. Strikingly, CHK2 phosphorylation was undetectable in MLH1-deficient cells, and phosphorylation of CHK1 was reduced after PUVA treatment, indicating that MLH1 is involved in signaling psoralen ICL-induced checkpoint activation. Psoralen ICLs can result in mutations near the crosslinked sites; however, MLH1 function was not required for the mutagenic repair of these lesions, and so its signaling function appears to have a role in maintaining genomic stability following exposure to ICL-induced DNA damage. Distinguishing the genetic status of MMR-deficient tumors as MSH2-deficient or MLH1-deficient is thus potentially important in predicting the efficacy of treatment with psoralen and perhaps with other ICL-inducing agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A new model for calculating stress fields of fractured media was established by incorporating stress correction factor based on displacement discontinuity boundary element method. The accuracy of the new model is close to 3D displacement discontinuity model, and its calculation is significantly simplified. An algorithm for multi-fracture propagation geometry was proposed based on fracture criterion and fracture growth rate law, which was used to investigate multi-fracture stress interference and propagation geometry. The results show that the size of stress interference is determined by the shortest dimension of fracture face, which is 1.2\u22121.5 times fracture height when fracture length is longer than fracture height, and 1.2\u22121.5 times fracture length when fracture length is shorter than fracture height. The larger the ratio of fracture spacing to fracture height, or the smaller the ratio of net pressure to the differential principle stress, the more close to well-bores the deviation position is, and the larger the deviation angle is. The middle fracture propagates to the fracture at a further distance and one dominating fracture propagates longest when three-cluster fractures are not equally spaced, while the middle fracture propagates straightly when three-cluster fractures are equally spaced.",

The implementation methods, design models and key issues were analyzed, and the future development direction was put forward. The research shows that the multi-cluster limited entry technique can achieve homogenous growth of multiple fractures. The hybrid stimulation of \u201cbreaking by rock gel stimulation + carrying proppant by slick water\u201d plus small-particle proppant can reduce the fracture complexity near the well bore and increase stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) in the far-field. The requirement of fracture conductivity in unconventional formations can be met by shear-sustained fractures and proppant-transporting slick water. The optimum well spacing between a child well and a parent well should be determined by the stimulation modes, injection volume and pressure drawdown. Reconstructing seepage field, stress field and stimulation targets is crucial for improving the stimulation results in a horizontal well. Reducing cluster spacing and well spacing is the basis for establishing development modes of fracture-controlled reserves. Fracturing-design decision system based on \u201cspatial-mode stimulation\u201d and geology-engineering integration is an important research direction for volume stimulation techniques.",
