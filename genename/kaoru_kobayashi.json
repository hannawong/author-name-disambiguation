        "abstract": "Many reports support the concept of serotonergic-dopaminergic interaction in the brain. However, at present, there are few methods to study this relationship in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitor, clomipramine, on a dopamine (DA) transporter ligand, [123I]β-CIT (RTI-55), in rat brain. Dose-dependent changes in [123I]β-CIT specific binding induced by clomipramine were studied in the striatum (rich in DA transporter) and the hypothalamus (rich in 5-HT transporter). The changes in the time-activity curves of [123I]β-CIT specific binding after clomipramine injection were also examined in these two regions. Using the cerebellum as the reference region,k3 andk4 values with and without clomipramine administration were estimated by a two-compartment kinetic analysis. Clomipramine inhibited [123I]β-CIT specific binding in the hypothalamus, but enhanced its specific binding in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analysis showed thatk3 in the striatum was increased by 55%. In conclusion, enhancement of [123I]β-CIT binding in the striatum after clomipramine administration indicated the possibility of 5-HT-DA interaction.",

        "abstract": "Benzbromarone (BBR) is a potent uricosuric drug that can cause serious liver injury. Our recent study suggested that 1'-hydroxy BBR, one of major metabolites of BBR, is metabolized to a cytotoxic metabolite that could be detoxified by glutathione (GSH). The aim of this study was to clarify whether GSH adducts are formed from 1'-hydroxy BBR in human liver microsomes (HLM). Incubation of 1'-hydroxy BBR with GSH in HLM did not result in the formation of GSH adducts, but 1',6-dihydroxy BBR was formed. In addition, incubation of 1',6-dihydroxy BBR with GSH in HLM resulted in the formation of three novel GSH adducts (M1, M2 and M3). The structures of M1 and M2 were estimated to be GSH adducts in which the 1-hydroxyethyl group at the C-2 position and the hydroxyl group at the C-1' position of 1',6-dihydroxy BBR were substituted by GSH, respectively. We also found that the 6-hydroxylation of 1'-hydroxy BBR is mainly catalyzed by CYP2C9 and that several CYPs and/or non-enzymatic reaction are involved in the formation of GSH adducts from 1',6-dihydroxy BBR. The results indicate that 1'-hydroxy BBR is metabolized to reactive metabolites via 1',6-dihydroxy BBR formation, suggesting that these reactive metabolites are responsible for BBR-induced liver injury.",

The ratio of radioactivity in the striatum to that in the cerebellum at 15 min after i.v. injection of 3H-SCH23390 or 45 min after injection of 3H-NMSP were used as indices of dopamine D1 or D2 receptor binding in vivo, respectively. In vivo binding of D1 and D2 receptors was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by acute treatment with desipramine (DMI). A saturation experiment suggested that the DMI-induced reduction in the binding was mainly due to the decrease in the affinity of both receptors. No direct interactions between the dopamine receptors and DMI were observed in vitro by the addition of 1 mM of DMI into striatal homogenate. Other antidepressants such as imipramine, clomipramine, maprotiline and mianserin also decreased the binding of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. The results indicated an important role of dopamine receptors in the pharmacological effect of antidepressants.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that is expressed in the liver and small intestine of humans. Various factors influence the expression of CYP3A4, but gender difference in CYP3A4 expression remains debatable. Objective: To clarify gender difference of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 in CYP3A-humanized mice generated by a human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector system. The CYP3A-humanized (CYP3A-HAC) mice have essential regulatory regions, including promoters and enhancers, and unknown elements affecting the expression of CYP3A4.Method: We examined the expression and activity of hepatic and intestinalCYP3A4 in male and female CYP3A-HAC mice. CYP3A activity was determined asɑ- and 4-hydroxylation activity of triazolam in liver and intestinal microsomes. Expression level of CYP3A protein was determined by Western blot analysis. Expression level of CYP3A4 mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR.Results: The results showed that triazolam hydroxylation activities and protein levels of CYP3A in the liver were significantly higher in female than in male CYP3A-HAC mice, whereas those in the intestine were not significantly different between the genders. In addition, the expression ofCYP3A4 mRNA showed a tendency similar to that found for the activity and expression of CYP3A protein in the liver and intestine of CYP3A-HAC mice.Conclusion: These findings suggest that the expression and activity levels of CYP3A4 in the liver are higher in females than in males, whereas there is no gender difference in the intestine of humans.",

The intra- and interassay CV were 3.83-5.34% and 3.56-5.84%, respectively. We determined and compared anti-PPC IgG antibody titers in the 40 normal individuals. We confirmed that a high titer of anti-PPC IgG antibody is contained in all normal human sera and that these antibodies are directed primarily to mannan by immunoblotting analysis. The ratio of the maximum to minimum anti-PPC IgG antibody titers in normal individuals was > 8,000. Anti-PPC IgG antibody titers did not correlate with the age.

In this study, we examined whether assembly assays to exploit the ligand-dependent interaction of N- and C-terminal regions of the LBD could be used for detection of ligands for PXR, CAR and LXR. Rifampicin, CITCO and T1317 significantly enhanced interactions for human PXR, human CAR and human LXR, respectively.

        "abstract": "Materials and methods Sixty-one patients with unilateral CCL who underwent a VGIR were enrolled in this study. At the 3-month follow-up after VGIR, the 61 patients were divided into either the good outcome (g-) group ( n = 37) or poor outcome (p-) group ( n = 24), according to the clinical success criteria. Age, gender, duration of symptoms, preoperative painless range of mandibular motion (P-ROM), preoperative TMJ pain, muscle symptoms, MRI findings (the severity of bony change, disc deformity and joint effusion), and arthroscopic findings (the severity of osteoarthritic change, synovial lesion and fibrous adhesion) were selected as the candidates of prognostic factors for VGIR. Each factor was compared between the two groups. Moreover, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Result The preoperative P-ROM of the p-group was significantly lower than that of the g-group. The severity of osteoarthritic change in the p-group was significantly greater than that of the g-group. Regarding the MRI findings, there were no significant differences between the two groups. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio showed that only a decreased preoperative P-ROM was significantly predictive for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR. Conclusion A pronounced decrease of preoperative P-ROM would be a significant risk factor for a poor clinical outcome of TMJ irrigation in patients with CCL. Keywords Temporomandibular joint Chronic closed lock Joint irrigation Clinical outcome Risk factor 1 Introduction Simple temporomandibular joint (TMJ) irrigation has been described as an effective treatment for chronic closed lock (CCL). However, it does not provide any diagnostic information on joint pathosis. The authors have developed and clinically applied the technique of visually guided TMJ irrigation (VGIR) [1,2] . The concept of VGIR was originally applied to the knee joint by Kalunian et a1. [3] . For the TMJ, the technique comprises an irrigation of the superior joint compartment (SJC) with a simultaneous arthroscopic examination using a 1.2-mm-diameter rod-lens arthroscope. The VGIR enables us to study on the correlation between clinical outcome parameters and arthroscopic findings. The therapeutic effects of TMJ irrigation are thought to be obtained through the draining of various inflammatory substances from the SJC [4,5] , and its clinical success rate for CCL ranged from 70 to 90% [6–8] . Risk factors of the poor clinical outcome for TMJ irrigation include the presence of condylar bony changes [9,10] , severe joint pain before surgery [9] , fibrous adhesion [10] , long duration of closed lock, [11] and a higher age of the patients [7] . In patients undergone a unsuccessful TMJ irrigation, condylar bony spicules [10,12] and severe fibrous adhesions [10] are often found during subsequent TMJ open surgery. In our previous reports, we have shown that the key predictive factor for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR was not arthroscopic findings [1,2] , but decreased preoperative painless range of mandibular motion (P-ROM) [12] . However, preoperative MR findings of possible predictive factors for prognosis were not included in those studies. Therefore, in this study, MR findings in addition to preoperative clinical data and arthroscopic findings were all analyzed to examine the predictive factors for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR in patients with CCL of the TMJ. 2 Materials and methods Sixty-four consecutive patients with unilateral CCL of the TMJ comprised the study group. They had all received unsuccessful nonsurgical treatments (medication, physiotherapy and an nocturnal bite splint therapy) prior to VGIR for more than 1 month. CCL was defined a persistent restricted mouth opening caused by functional TMJ pain for more than 1 month. On the other hand, all of them had unconscious bruxism which was proved by attrition, oppressive pain or discomfort of masticatory muscles and awareness of their clenching habit. The exclusion criteria were past history of severe jaw trauma, previous TMJ surgeries, or other joint diseases. The 64 patients underwent VGIR under local anesthesia as previously described [1,2] , briefly, VGIR of the SJC with more than 150-ml physiological saline solution concomitant with arthroscopic observation using a 1.2-mm-diameter rod-lens arthroscope. We did not perform any surgical treatment such as lysis of fibrous adhesion or lateral release of the joint capsule even if intra-articular fibrous adhesions were arthroscopically observed. No additional TMJ injections with sodium hyaluronate or corticosteroids were given because we would investigate the clinical course of VGIR without medication. At the time of VGIR, the patient's painless range of mandibular motion (P-ROM; interincisal distance, mm) was <38 mm or self-evaluated functional TMJ pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; range 0–100) was ≥20, or both. After VGIR, an antibiotic and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) were prescribed for 3 days in all patients to control postoperative inflammation and infection. Mandibular motion exercises consisting of self-controlled mouth opening, protrusion, and lateral movements began 3 days after VGIR. They were done at 2 or 3 sessions per day, with 5 repeats of each movement per session. Nocturnal bite splint therapy was continued in all patients to prevent overloading to the TMJ due to overnight bruxism. These postoperative treatments including nocturnal bite splint therapy were continued until the patient was symptom-free. Moreover, we made a rule to perform no additional surgical treatment until the 3-month follow-up after VGIR. However, if additional surgical treatments were clinically required after 3-month follow-up, we applied the second VGIR or open TMJ surgery to the patients needing them. Three of the 64 patients (4.7%) dropped out from regular follow-ups and the remaining 61 patients were analyzed. The mean age of the 61 patients (9 men and 52 women) was 40.7 ± 15.1 (1SD) years. The median duration of symptoms prior to the VGIR was 7 (range 2–127) months. The patients received nonsurgical treatment for a median 3 (range 1–48) months. The baseline data of the mean preoperative P-ROM and VAS were 31.1 ± 6.31 (1SD) mm and a median 48 (range 11–85), respectively. MR images were obtained with a 0.3 T system (MPR-7000; Hitachi Medical Co, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a coil for the TMJ. The imaging parameters for sagittal direction of TMJ were TR/TE 400/23 ms, field of view (FOV) of 120 mm, and slice thickness of 4.0 mm, coronal TR/TE 450/23 ms, FOV of 180 mm, and slice thickness of 4.0 mm. Using MR images, we evaluated and scored the severity of bony changes (BC), the severity of changes in disc configuration (DC), and the severity of joint effusion (JE) ( Table 1 ). We used the evaluation criteria of Larheim et al. [13] and Westesson and Brooks [14] as a reference. The severity of arthroscopically observed intra-articular lesions during VGIR was assessed according to the following arthroscopic scores: articular surface (AS) score, synovial lining (SL) score, and fibrous adhesion (FA) score ( Table 2 ) [12] . The success criteria for VGIR are shown in Table 3 [12] . They were established by referring to the minimal limit of the maximal range of mandibular motion (38 mm) in women without TMJ dysfunction [15] , and the success criteria for TMJ irrigation presented by Murakami et al. [7] . The follow-up period in this study was more than 12 (median 24, range 12–40) months after VGIR. According to the success criteria, however, the 61 patients were divided into either the good outcome (g) group or poor outcome (p) group at the 3-month follow-up, because a slower improvement of clinical state observed after 3-month follow-up does not seem to be an independent effect of VGIR. Actually, the prominent clinical improvement after TMJ irrigation or arthroscopic surgery had generally been observed within 3 months [12,16,17] . Between the g- and p-groups, the investigated factors of age, gender, duration of symptoms prior to the VGIR, preoperative P-ROM and VAS, muscle symptoms before or after VGIR, the arthroscopic scores, and MRI scores were compared. After that, the clinical course after 3-month follow-up point including their experiences of additional surgical treatments (a repeated VGIR or open TMJ surgery) were recorded. Mann–Whitney U -test or chi-square test were used for comparative analyses. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to calculate the crude odds ratio (OR) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the investigated factors for the clinical outcome of VGIR. Then, to eliminate the confounding factors, multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted OR by the factors correlated to the clinical outcome. A probability value ( P -value) of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. The software used for statistical analyses was the SPSS Version 12.0 (SPSS, Tokyo, Japan). 3 Results At 3-month follow-up, 37 (60.6%) of the 61 patients were classified into the g-group, and 24 patients into the p-group. The mean preoperative P-ROM of the p-group (28.0 ± 6.16; range, 18–42 mm) was significantly lower than that of the g-group (33.1 ± 5.63; range, 20–46 mm) ( P = 0.002), but there are no differences in other parameters between g- and p-groups ( Table 4 ). At postoperative 3-month follow-up, the mean P-ROM of p-group (32.8 ± 6.59; range, 20–45 mm) was significantly lower than that of the g-group (43.5 ± 4.02; range, 38–52 mm), and the median VAS of the p-group (25; range 7–90) was significantly greater than that of the g-group (0; range 0–15) ( Table 5 ). The frequency of high AS score in the p-group was significantly greater than that of the g-group ( P = 0.024) ( Table 6 ). Regarding the BC, DC and JE scores, there were no significant differences between the g- and p-groups ( Table 7 ). The multivariate adjusted OR showed that a decreased preoperative P-ROM (0.843; 95%CI, 0.737–0.966) was significantly predictive for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR ( P = 0.013) ( Table 8 ). Seven of the 24 patients in the p-group reached to the success criteria between 3- and 6-month follow-ups, and final success rate of a single VGIR without additional surgical treatments was 72.1%. Of the remaining 17 patients, 14 patients underwent a successful second VGIR or open TMJ surgery. Finally, 3 patients did not reach to the success criteria until the end of follow-up period. 4 Discussion The present results showed that preoperative decreased P-ROM is a predictive risk factor for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR. This is congruent with our previous report [12] . The BC, DC and JE scores based on the preoperative MR findings did not show any significant differences between the g- and p-groups. Therefore, the preoperative MR findings do not seem to be predictive for the clinical outcome of VGIR. But a condylar bony spicule with persistent pain is regarded as one of the indications of open TMJ surgery [10,12] . If MRI can precisely detect the bony spicule of the TMJ, its findings would provide useful information for deciding to apply an open TMJ surgery after unsuccessful TMJ irrigation. However, the detectability of bone surface on the MRI appeared to be less than that of CT [18] . Therefore, our criteria for bony changes on MRI were focused on the erosive changes and abnormal signal in the condyle, which are considered to be suggesting signs of a progressive disease, and the bone lesion recognized on the MRI in this study might need to be verified by the findings of CT. JE has been suggested to indicate intra-articular inflammation in patients with internal derangement (ID) and OA of the TMJ. Close correlation between JE and TMJ pain was reported [14] . A strong correlation between JE and hypervasculality of the synovial membrane has been also found [19] . Furthermore, preoperative severity of JE may be a predictor for the clinical outcome of VGIR [20] . Therefore, we expected a reduction of JE scores in the g-group compared to the p-group. In fact, although JE was detected more frequently in the p-group than in the g-group. However, there were no significant differences in the JE score between the two groups. This suggests that preoperative findings of JE might not be a risk factor of a poor clinical outcome of VGIR. On the other hand, JE was frequently detected in the nonfunctional TMJs [21] . Lack of pumping action from joint movements impairing metabolism of synovial fluid may let a surplus pool in the joint compartment [22] . Thus, JE detected in this study might be derived from TMJ dysfunction due to decreased P-ROM. Regarding the relationship between the arthroscopic scores and the prognosis, the AS score of the p-group was higher than that of the g-group. However, the multivariate adjusted OR showed that the AS score was not a single prognosis-predicting factor for VGIR. SL score designed to evaluate the severity of synovitis which is assumed to be related to the various inflammatory substances in the synovial fluid. Symptom relief after TMJ irrigation has been thought to result from washing out various pro-inflammatory mediators in the synovial fluid with more than 100-ml irrigation [4,5,23] . Therefore, we irrigated TMJ with more than 150-ml saline, and assumed that the severe synovitis is a powerful risk factor for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR. In the present study, however, there were no significant differences in the preoperative SL score between the two groups. This result is consistent with our previous reports [12,20] and indicating that SL score is not a predictive risk factor for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR. On the other hand, the presence of fibrous adhesions have been suggested to lead a poor clinical outcome of TMJ irrigation [10] . Fibrous adhesion was reported to impair TMJ movement, thus it has been believed that trismus can be improved by dissecting fibrous adhesions [24–26] . However, our serial studies [2,12,27] including this one suggested that the severity of fibrous adhesion is not significant predictor for clinical outcome of VGIR. Holmlund and Axelsson [28] stated that fibrous adhesion did not always impair mandibular movement. Moreover, it was demonstrated that fibrous adhesions were not improved at all even in cases with successful outcome of VGIR [27] . Consequently, we noticed that preoperative arthroscopic findings are not predictive for clinical outcome of TMJ irrigation, and the success rate of a single VGIR is almost same as that of a simple TMJ irrigation (arthrocentesis) without arthroscopy [7,8,29] . This seems to show that arthroscopic inspection does not contribute to the clinical outcome of TMJ irrigation. However, VGIR technique using a thin rod-lens arthroscope is considered as a useful modality with respect to that it makes us to be able to obtain clear arthroscopic findings concomitant with TMJ irrigation under local anesthesia. The prominent clinical improvement in ROM and VAS after TMJ irrigation or arthroscopic surgery had generally been observed within approximately 3 months [16,17] . Moreover, obvious improvements in symptoms are observed over time without aggressive treatment in at least 40% of patients with ID [30] . Therefore, it is not clear whether the improvements of clinical symptoms were attributable to the effect of VGIR or a natural course at the over 3-month follow-up. For these reasons, we evaluated the prognosis of VGIR at 3-month follow-up to minimize the effect of natural course in the present study. In conclusion, a pronounced decrease of preoperative P-ROM is detected as a significant risk factor for a poor clinical outcome of VGIR in patients with CCL. References [1] T. Kondoh M.F. Dolwick Y.

The presence or absence of disk perforation was confirmed by TMJ arthrography. The MR images were evaluated for the presence or absence of disk deformity, disk displacement, condylar bone changes and joint effusion and for visualization of the temporal posterior attachment (TPA) of the posterior disk attachment. Those findings were compared among the 3 groups.The incidences of anterior disk displacement and condylar bone changes in the patients group with disk perforation were significantly higher than in asymptomatic volunteers. Disk deformity and obscurity of TPA were significantly more frequent in the patient group with disk perforation than in the other 2 groups.In addition to disk deformity, TPA obscurity was considered to be one of the characteristic MRI findings of TMJs with disk perforation.",

[11C]-[S]-DMBA was rapidly distributed into the brain, heart and lungs, and considerable long-term retention in the brain was\n observed. The radioactive metabolites in the plasma were analyzed by liquid chromatography. Kinetic analysis using unmetabolized\n [11C]DMBA in the plasma as the input function was performed employing a simplified two-compartment model. The estimated distribution\n volumes (DV) of [11C]DMBA in the brain and heart were 6.05 and 3.95, respectively. The right striatum of the rat brain was lesioned with ibotenic\n acid 2 weeks before the tracer experiment. Bothin vitro andin vivo autoragiographic studies were performed, and revealed significant reduction of the radioactivity levels in the lesioned striatum.\n On the other hand, the regional cerebral blood flow, as measured by [14C]iodoantipyrine, was not significantly altered in the lesioned striatum. These results indicate that the ionic binding component\n for DMBA exists mainly in neural cells rather than in glial cells. [11C]DMBA might be a useful radiotracer for detection of neural cell loss in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Studies to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform(s) involved in chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylation were performed using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed human CYPs. The kinetics of chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes showed a simple Michaelis-Menten behavior. The apparent Km and Vmax values were 3.4+/-1.0 microM and 200.5+/-83.7 pmol/min/mg, respectively. The chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes showed good correlations with desipramine 2-hydroxylase activity (r = 0.763, p < 0.05), a marker activity for CYP2D6, and phenacetin O-deethylase activity (r = 0.638, p < 0.05), a marker activity for CYP1A2. Quinidine (an inhibitor of CYP2D6) completely inhibited while alpha-naphthoflavone (an inhibitor of CYP1A2) marginally inhibited the chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylase activity in a human liver microsomal sample showing high CYP2D6 activity. On the other hand, alpha-naphthoflavone inhibited the chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylase activity to 55-65% of control in a human liver microsomal sample showing low CYP2D6 activity. Among eleven cDNA-expressed CYPs studied, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 exhibited significant activity for the chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylation. The Km values for the chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylation of both cDNA-expressed CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 were in agreement with the Km values of human liver microsomes. These results suggest that chlorpromazine 7-hydroxylation is catalyzed mainly by CYP2D6 and partially by CYP1A2.",

        "abstract": "We compared 11C-choline and FDG PET/CT scan findings for the staging and restaging of prostate cancer. Twenty Japanese prostate cancer patients underwent 11C-choline and FDG PET/CT before (n=5) or after (n=15) treatment. Using a five-point scale, we compared these scanning modalities regarding patient- and lesion-based diagnostic performance for local recurrence, untreated primary tumor, and lymph node and bony metastases. Of the 20 patients, documented local lesions, and node and bony metastases were present in 11 (55.0%), 9 (45.0%), and 13 (65.0%), respectively. The patient-based sensitivity/specificity/accuracy/area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) values for 11C-choline-PET/CT for diagnosing local lesions were 90.9% /100%/ 95.0% / 1.0, whereas those for FDG-PET/CT were 45.5% /100%/ 75.0% / 0.773. Those for 11C-choline-PET/CT for node metastasis were 88.9% /100%/ 95.0% / 0.944, and those for FDG-PET/CT were 44.4%/100%/75.0%/0.722. Those for 11C-choline-PET/CT for bone metastasis were 84.6%/100%/90.0%/0.951, and those for FDG-PET/CT were 76.9% /100%/ 85.0% / 0.962. The AUCs for local lesion and node metastasis differed significantly (p=0.0039, p=0.011, respectively). The lesion-based detection rates of 11C-choline compared to FDG PET/CT for local lesion, and node and bone metastases were 91.7% vs. 41.7%, 92.0% vs. 32.0%, and 94.8% vs. 83.0% (p=0.041, p=0.0030, p<0.0001), respectively. 11C-choline-PET/CT is more useful for the staging and restaging of prostate cancer than FDG-PET/CT in Japanese men.",

However, little is known of the binding properties of sabcomeline under in vivo conditions. In this study, muscarinic receptor occupancy by sabcomeline in mouse brain regions and heart was estimated using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and [3H]N-methylpiperidyl benzilate (NMPB) as radioligands. In the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, the estimated IC50 value of sabcomeline for [3H]NMPB binding was almost 0.2 mg/kg. Sabcomeline was not a selective ligand to M1 receptors as compared with biperiden in vivo. In the cerebral cortex, maximum receptor occupancy was observed about 1 hr after intravenous injection of sabcomeline (0.3 mg/kg), and the binding availability of mACh receptors had almost returned to the control level by 3-4 hr. These findings indicated that the binding kinetics of sabcomeline is rather rapid in mouse brain. Examination of dopamine D2 receptor binding revealed that sabcomeline affected the kinetics of both [3H]raclopride and [3H]N-methylspiperone (NMSP) binding in the striatum. It significantly decreased the k3 and k4 of [3H]raclopride binding resulting in an increase in binding potential (BP = k3/k4 = Bmax/Kd) in sabcomeline-treated mice, and an approximately 15% decrease in k3 of [3H]NMSP binding was also observed. Although the mechanism is still unclear, sabcomeline altered dopamine D2 receptor affinity or availability by modulations via neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements in 6-month-old F344/N rats were performed in the conscious state and the influence of chloral hydrate, ketamine, and pentobarbital anesthesia on dopamine D(1) (DA-D(1)) receptor binding was evaluated using [(11)C]SCH23390, a selective DA-D(1) receptor ligand. To perform the PET study in conscious rats, an original fixation apparatus was developed and the animals were trained to acclimate to the scanning atmosphere for 3 h. This training was carried out twice a day for 2 weeks. PET measurements in conscious rats were successful, since the trained rats scarcely moved during the scanning (as monitored by video camera) and since highly reproducible measurements of binding potential (BP) were derived from their scanning. Chloral hydrate and ketamine anesthesia significantly increased the striatal BP of DA-D(1) receptors by 36% and 46%, respectively, compared to that observed in the conscious state. In contrast, pentobarbital markedly decreased the BP by 41%. These BP values of DA-D(1) receptors were calculated using a curve-fitting method. Our results indicate that PET studies in rats should be performed in the conscious state since the anesthetics dramatically modified ligand-receptor bindings, such as DA-D(1) receptor binding, in rat brain.",

Overexpression of GADD34 significantly enhanced the production of recombinant AT-III in CHO 13D-35D cells. The specific rate of AT-III production in the GADD34-overexpressing CHO 13D-35D cells reached approximately 28 pg/cell/d. After 144 h of incubation, the AT-III concentration in the culture supernatant was approximately 40% higher than that observed in the case of the parental CHO 13D-35D cells. The mRNA expression, specific activity, and fucosylation of AT-III were not affected by GADD34 overexpression. Overexpression of GADD34 is a promising method of improving the production of secreted protein pharmaceuticals in CHO cells.",

        "abstract": "Although \"genomically\" humanized animals are invaluable tools for generating human disease models as well as for biomedical research, their development has been mainly restricted to mice via established transgenic-based and embryonic stem cell-based technologies. Since rats are widely used for studying human disease and for drug efficacy and toxicity testing, humanized rat models would be preferred over mice for several applications. However, the development of sophisticated humanized rat models has been hampered by the difficulty of complex genetic manipulations in rats. Additionally, several genes and gene clusters, which are megabase range in size, were difficult to introduce into rats with conventional technologies. As a proof of concept, we herein report the generation of genomically humanized rats expressing key human drug-metabolizing enzymes in the absence of their orthologous rat counterparts via the combination of chromosome transfer using mouse artificial chromosome (MAC) and genome editing technologies. About 1.5 Mb and 700 kb of the entire UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 and cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A genomic regions, respectively, were successfully introduced via the MACs into rats. The transchromosomic rats were combined with rats carrying deletions of the endogenous orthologous genes, achieved by genome editing. In the \"transchromosomic humanized\" rat strains, the gene expression, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism observed in humans were well reproduced. Thus, the combination of chromosome transfer and genome editing technologies can be used to generate fully humanized rats for improved prediction of the pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions in humans, and for basic research, drug discovery, and development.",

        "abstract": "The effect of MK-801, a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, on the in vivo binding of [3H]SCH 23390, a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, was investigated in the mouse brain. The radioactivity following injection of the tracer was measured in the striatum, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. It was found that MK-801 increased the [3H]SCH 23390 binding in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner, but did not influence the binding in the cerebral cortex. The kinetic analysis using the cerebellum as a reference region revealed that the apparent increase in [3H]SCH 23390 binding in the striatum was mainly due to the increase in the input rate of the specific binding component. An in vivo saturation study using varying doses of [3H]SCH 23390 indicated that the maximum binding sites available (Bmax) in the striatum was not altered by MK-801. As the rate constant K3 includes both Bmax and the association rate constant (kon), an increase in the rate constant kon in vivo was the primary factor in the changes in [3H]SCH 23390 binding. The changes in the rate constant kon in vivo seem to be due to a NMDA receptor-mediated process. An in vivo binding method would be applicable for the investigation of the neural interaction between glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons in intact brain.",

Uptake of [11C]NMPB continuously increased in all brain areas with the exception of the cerebellum. For the quantification of receptor binding, a compartment model, in which radioactivity in the cerebellum was used as an input function, was used.

        "abstract": "The human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) plays a dominant role in the metabolism of numerous clinically useful drugs. Alterations in the activity or expression of this enzyme may account for a major part of the variation in drug responsiveness and toxicity. However, it is generally accepted that most of the known single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding and 5'-flanking regions are not the main determinants for the large inter-individual variability of CYP3A4 expression and activity. We show that the allelic variation is critically involved in determining the individual total hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA level and metabolic capability. There exists a definite correlation between the total CYP3A4 mRNA level and allelic expression ratio, the relative transcript level ratio derived from the two alleles. Individuals with a low expression ratio, exhibiting a large difference of transcript level between the two alleles, revealed extremely low levels of total hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA, and thus low metabolic capability as assessed by testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. These results present a new insight into the individualized CYP3A4-dependent pharmacotherapy and the importance of expression imbalance to human phenotypic diversity.",

A phase-1 trial examined 22\n healthy volunteers to determine its safety and suitable massage pressure, examining three different pressures. The volunteers\n evaluated their comfort, warmth, and ease of mouth opening by use of a visual analogue scale (VAS). A phase-2 trial examined\n the safety, suitable dose regimen, and efficacy in 12 patients. Maximal mouth opening was measured, and muscle pain and massage\n were evaluated subjectively.\n \n \n \n Results  The robot was safe in the phase-1 trial, except for two massages in which the pressure was excessive. Massages at 6–10 N were\n given the highest VAS scores. In phase 2, the massage pressure was arbitrary and each muscle was massaged seven times for\n 1 min, three times every two weeks. After evaluating the efficacy, additional treatments were performed at a greater pressure\n or for longer. The massage treatment was very effective for most patients.\n \n \n \n Conclusion  The massage treatment was safe and effective for most patients when administered at a pressure of 6–10 N seven times for 1 min\n per muscle every two weeks. The robot may constitute a useful tool for treating TMJ dysfunction associated with myofascial\n pain.",

Two PET scans were performed in each subject: (1) control scan; (2) after oral administration of 0.5 mg triazolam or placebo. The previously discussed amnestic effect of triazolam was measured by immediate and delayed recall of meaningful and meaningless syllables. A compartment model employing the radioactivity in the cerebellum as an input function was used for the quantification of receptor binding. The binding parameter, k3, was decreased after triazolam administration in all measured regions, whereas no change was observed after placebo treatment. The reduction compared to the control study varied from 8.6 +/- 3.7% in the temporal cortex to 16.3 +/- 6.3% in the thalamus. Triazolam administration impaired both immediate and delayed recall of syllables, whereas placebo administration had no effects. Benzodiazepine agonists are reported to decrease the cortical acetylcholine release. The decrease of acetylcholine release in the synaptic cleft might be the explanation for the decreased binding of [11C]NMPB.",

Recently, we developed fully humanized transchromosomic (Tc) CYP3A mice with the CYP3A cluster including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43. Our humanized CYP3A mice have the CYP3A5*3 (g.6986G) allele, resulting in the almost absence of CYP3A5 protein expression in the liver and intestine. To produce model mice for predicting CYP3A5's contribution to pharmacokinetics, we performed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) modification of CYP3A5 (g.6986G to A, *3 to *1) on the CYP3A cluster using genome editing in  both mouse ES cells and fertilized eggs, and produced humanized CYP3A5*1 mice recapitulating the CYP3A5*1 carrier phenotype in humans. The humanized CYP3A mouse with CYP3A5*1 is the first Tc mouse for predicting the SNP effect on pharmacokinetics in humans. The combination of Tc technology and genome editing enables the production of useful humanized models that reflect humans with different SNPs.",

Optically active isomers 2 and 13 were synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated. Compound 2 exhibited greater potency and more isoform selectivity than enantiomer 13 in the iNOS inhibition assay. One of the gem-chlorines on the fused cyclopropane moiety of 2 was eliminated to produce 3, which showed reduced potency for iNOS inhibition, as well as 4 with an increased potency. The isoform selectivity of 4 was also much higher than that of 3. This was also true for the corresponding methyl derivatives 6-9. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) study and computer aided docking study of the most optimized structure 4 with human iNOS will also be reported.",

The results were analyzed in relation to a single nucleotide polymorphism (-11187G>A) located in the promoter region and levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha mRNA.There was a 4.9-fold interindividual variability of OATP1B1 mRNA expression level in the livers analyzed, which was not associated with -11187G>A polymorphism. Accordingly, the -11187G>A polymorphism did not alter the SLCO1B1 gene promoter activity in luciferase assays. On the other hand, OATP1B1 mRNA levels showed a significant correlation with HNF1alpha mRNA levels (r=0.83, P<0.0001). This correlation was consistent with the results of luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showing functional interaction between HNF1alpha and SLCO1B1 gene promoter.Our results suggest that HNF1alpha is an essential regulator of OATP1B1 mRNA expression and thus the level of HNF1alpha expression is one of the major determinants of interindividual variability in OATP1B1 mRNA expression.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear receptor constitutive androstane/active receptor (CAR) is well known as a transcription factor regulating many genes that encode drug-metabolizing enzymes and factors modulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, there have been few studies on regulation of the CAR gene itself. In this study, we examined the involvement of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) in transcriptional regulation of the CAR gene in the liver. The expression levels of CAR mRNA in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells were increased by all-trans retinoic acid. Activities of the human CAR promoter containing a region (termed cRARE) located at +1453/+1469 within intron 1 were increased by co-expression of RAR alpha in HepG2 cells. In addition, introduction of mutation into cRARE abolished transcriptional activation of the promoter by RAR alpha. The results of gel mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that RAR alpha was bound to cRARE. These results suggest that RAR alpha transactivated the human CAR gene by binding to cRARE located at +1453/+1469 within intron 1 of the gene. In contrast, the rat CAR gene was not activated by exposure to all-trans retinoic acid, probably due to the lack of a region corresponding to cRARE in the human CAR gene. Although the physiological significance of RAR alpha-dependent up-regulation of CAR in the human liver remains to be clarified, retinoid metabolism may be regulated by the up-regulation of CAR.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a fermentation process for recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) production using an expression strain of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The high productivity of the process enables it to compete with the production of plasma derived HSA. After purification of the rHSA, the content of yeast derived contaminants was less than 1 ng/250 mg of rHSA. The results from structural analyses suggested that purified rHSA possessed an identical conformation to plasma derived HSA. Furthermore, no neoantigenicity different from that of plasma derived HSA was observed. The efficacy and safety of rHSA were tested in clinical studies, and it was shown that there was no difference between rHSA and plasma derived HSA in a comparison study. The high efficacy of rHSA with little or no adverse reaction was confirmed in these studies.",

Two mandibles indicating the presence of AMF were examined more minutely using a limited CBCT. Following the three-dimensional radiological observation of ABF, the mandibles were removed from the cadavers and dissected with referring to the findings of AMF on the limited CBCT images.Four ABF of the three mandibular sides, which were depicted with limited CBCT, had different perimandibular neurovascularisation. Three accessory foramina were associated with the following arteries: a branch of the submental, facial, and buccal artery, and one was associated with a branch of the mental nerve. A branch of the mental nerve re-entered the mandible through the accessory foramen after it exited from a mental foramen.Limited CBCT is useful for pre-operative three-dimensional assessment of mandible since high-resolution analysis demonstrates not only the skeletal conditions but also the assessment and suggestions of perimandibular neurovascularisation.",

        "abstract": "The diagnostic imaging examinations in all 29 dental university hospitals in Japan were analyzed during a 1-year period from April 1999 to March 2000. The total number of patients examined was 790?859, which corresponded to 27?271 patients per hospital on average, with a range from 7872 to 62?904. Relative to the total number of patients, intraoral radiography was found to have been most frequently performed, 59% on average, with a range from 40% to 80%, depending on the hospital. Extraoral radiography, mostly panoramic radiography, was 36% on average with the range from 18% to 56%. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the percentages of intraoral and extraoral radiography, relative to the total number of all types of imaging examinations. Computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed with their own apparatuses in 27 hospitals with a frequency of 2.9% of patients in all imaging examinations on average and 9.1% at maximum. The scanning parameter of milliampere seconds (mAs) for individual types of routinely performed CT examinations varied widely, and thus the patient dose can be expected to be considerably reduced, without reducing the amount of diagnostic information to be obtained. Other imaging examinations performed were magnetic resonance imaging in 11 hospitals, X-ray fluoroscopy in 8 hospitals, ultrasonography in 20, nuclear medicine in 5, and bone densitometry in 1 hospital.",

We enrolled 192 patients (including four with distant metastasis at diagnosis) who were pathologically diagnosed as having minimally invasive FTC between 1998 and 2007 at Kuma Hospital. When the Ki-67 LI was higher than 5% in the hot area, we regarded it as a high Ki-67 LI. In a univariate analysis, patient age (≥45 years), high-frequent vascular invasion (≥4 in H&E specimens), and high Ki-67 LI significantly predicted the disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients. Since none of the patients <45 years old showed a recurrence, we performed a multivariate analysis of variables other than patient age. In the multivariate analysis including the presence of vascular invasion, high Ki-67 LI was an independent predictor of carcinoma recurrence. However, in the multivariate analysis including high-frequent vascular invasion, only high-frequent vascular invasion independently affected the DFS. These findings suggest that the Ki-67 LI has a rather strong prognostic value for the DFS of patients, although its impact was less than those of patient age and high-frequent vascular invasion.",

We found a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CYP2C19 gene as follows: SNP, 040110MoritaJ001; GENENAME: CYP2C19; ACCESSION NUMBER: NT_030059.8; LENGTH; 25 bases; 5'-GAGGGCCTGGCCC/TGCATGGAGCTGT-3'. The SNP (168946C>T) induced an amino acid alteration (Arg442Cys) located in exon 9 close to the heme-binding region of CYP2C19, which may result in the decrease in the catalytic properties of CYP2C19. A new allele having this SNP was designated as CYP2C19*16.",

The monkey was anesthetized with ketamine and intravenously injected with either11C-iomazenil or11C-flumazenil in combination with the coadministration of different doses of non-radioactive flumazenil (0,5 and 20 μg/kg).\n \n The regional distribution of11C-iomazenil in the brain was similar to that of11C-flumazenil, but the sensitivity of11C-iomazenil binding to competitive inhibition by non-radioactive flumazenil was much less than that of11C-flumazenil binding. A significant reduction in11C-flumazenil binding in the cerebral cortex was observed with 20 μg/kg of flumazenil, whereas a relatively smaller inhibition\n of11C-iomazenil binding in the same region was observed with the same dose of flumazenil. These results suggest that11C-flumazenil may be a superior radiotracer for estimating benzodiazepine receptor occupancy in the intact brain.",

        "abstract": "Objectives  An insufficient knowledge of anatomy often complicates the interpretation of radiological findings by students learning clinical\n medicine. During a 3-week clinical course in oral radiology, students attended lectures on anatomy for half of each day. Our\n objectives were to evaluate this program and determine why some students remained unmotivated to learn anatomy.\n \n \n \n Methods  Surveys were carried out using two questionnaires, one for evaluating the students’ beliefs regarding the necessity of knowing\n anatomy and their understanding of radiology and anatomy, and the other for determining the value of the educational program.\n In total, 126 questionnaires were analyzed. Structural equation modeling and decision analysis were used to analyze the data\n obtained.\n \n \n \n Results  Beliefs regarding the necessity of knowing anatomy were explained by three variables: the necessity of knowing imaging anatomy,\n the necessity of knowing gross anatomy, and understanding of anatomy. Awareness of the necessity of knowing anatomy and understanding\n of graphical images were not strongly correlated. The educational program was characterized by two factors: “value” and “appropriateness”\n These were strongly correlated. Student interest in the content of the course was found to be the most important factor in\n student evaluations of the educational program. Students who answered “agree”, “disagree” or “strongly disagree” to three\n items, “interested in the content of the course”, “obtained knowledge through the course” and “expected the course to be useful\n in the near future” were likely to have insufficient understanding of and awareness of the necessity of radiology and anatomy.\n \n \n \n Conclusions  The inclusion of lectures on anatomy is beneficial for improving student understanding of oral radiology. Student interest\n in the content is important in evaluations of radiology–anatomy programs.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that overproduction of prostanoids attributable to overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an im- portant role in colon carcinogenesis. We have shown recently that the prostaglandin (PG) E receptor, EP1, but not EP3, is involved in mouse colon carcinogenesis. In line with our previous study, here we examined the role of prostanoid receptors in colon carcinogenesis using six addi- tional lines of knockout mice deficient in prostanoid receptors EP 2 ,E P 4, DP, FP, IP, or TP. The animals were treated with the colon carcinogen, azoxymethane (AOM), and examined for the development of aberrant crypt foci (ACFs), putative preneoplastic lesions in the colon. Formation of ACFs was decreased only in the EP4-knockout mice, to 56% of the wild-type level. To confirm these results, we also examined the inhibitory effects of an EP4-selective antagonist, ONO-AE2-227, in the diet on the formation of AOM-induced colon ACFs in C57BL/6Cr mice and on the development of intestinal polyps in Min mice. ONO-AE2-227 at a dose of 400 ppm reduced the formation of ACFs to 67% of the control level, and intestinal polyp numbers in Min mice receiving 300 ppm were decreased to 69% of the control level. Plating efficiency assays showed that addition of 1.0 M ONO-AE1-329, an EP4-selective agonist, resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the colony number of the human colon cancer cell line, HCA-7, similar to the effect of PGE2. Moreover, EP4 mRNA expression was clearly observed in normal colon mucosa and colon tumors in mice. Our previous and present results indicate that PGE2 contributes to colon carcinogenesis through its actions mediated through EP1 and EP4 recep- tors; therefore, antagonists for these two receptors may be good candi- dates as chemopreventive agents against colon cancer.",

        "abstract": "We studied the kinetic disposition and metabolism of E3810 [(+/-)-sodium 2-[[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl]methylsulfinyl ]-1H- benzimidazole], a new proton pump inhibitor, and omeprazole in 15 Japanese male volunteers, six of whom were poor metabolizers and nine of whom were extensive metabolizers of S-mephenytoin. All received once-daily 20 mg doses of E3810 or omeprazole for 7 days in a randomized crossover manner, with a 3-week washout period between the two trial phases. The parent drugs and their principal metabolites in plasma and urine were measured on days 1 and 7 after drug administration. The mean values for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of omeprazole were 6.3- and 4.4-fold greater, whereas those of E3810 were 1.8- and 1.9-fold greater in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers after the first and final doses, respectively. Although the mean AUC values for both drugs were significantly (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) greater in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, the difference in the AUC between the two groups was smaller after E3810 than after omeprazole administration. The AUC of omeprazole tended to increase with the repeated doses in extensive metabolizers, whereas no such change was observed for E3810. The urinary excretions of the principal metabolite(s) of two proton pump inhibitors also reflected the data derived from plasma samples in relation to S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation status. We conclude that the metabolism of two proton pump inhibitors is under coregulatory control of S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19), but that the magnitude of CYP2C19-mediated metabolism appears to differ between the two drugs. In contrast to omeprazole, the metabolism of E3810 is less saturable in extensive metabolizers during the repetitive dosings.",

A 60-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of discomfort and mastication difficulty as a result of dislocation of the mandible on the left side. After a general examination, she was diagnosed with temporomandibular joint disorder and MR imaging was performed. The images showed artifacts in the bilateral temporal regions, although the patient had not undergone surgical treatment in the region and there were no metal hair accessories. However, mascara had been applied to the region to dye the patient’s hair black. To verify that mascara could be the cause of the artifacts in the temporomandibular area, we performed mock MR imaging using a phantom and mascara. Artifacts were also observed in the area with mascara, confirming that the mascara caused the artifacts during MR imaging. This case suggests that care should be taken during MR imaging when different cosmetics are used in the head and neck region.",

Fifteen temporomandibular joints (24%) had a history of luxation. Clicking was observed in 26 temporomandibular joints (42%), all of which were the thin flat disk type (chi-square test, P < .01). Pain was observed in 19% of patients with the thin flat disk type and 60% of those with the perforated disk type (P < .05).Magnetic resonance imaging could clearly reveal the details of posterior disk displacement in the temporomandibular joint. The clinical findings were dissimilar between the thin flat and the perforated disk type.",

        "abstract": "Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is involved in the transactivation of ABCB1 gene by rifampicin (RIF). However, we found that increase in ABCB1 mRNA by RIF was observed in LS180 cells but not in HepG2 cells. Since both cell lines expressed PXR equally, we hypothesized that a factor(s) other than PXR is responsible for PXR-mediated transactivation of the ABCB1 gene. Reporter activities of a distal enhancer module containing direct repeat 4 (DR4) motifs were increased by RIF in LS180 cells but not in HepG2 cells. Mutation of the DR4 motifs diminished the increase in reporter activities in LS180 cells. Gene subtraction showed that epithelial-specific ETS factor 3 (ESE-3) is a transcription factor enriched in LS180 cells compared to HepG2 cells. When ESE-3 and PXR were co-expressed in HepG2 cells, reporter activities were increased by RIF, which were completely abolished by mutation of DR4 motifs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed specific binding of ESE-3 to the region containing the DR4 motifs of the ABCB1 gene. Finally, knock-down of ESE-3 in LS180 cells resulted in a decrease in the induction of ABCB1 mRNA. These results suggest that ESE-3 is a factor responsible for PXR-mediated transactivation of the ABCB1 gene by RIF in LS180 cells.",

        "abstract": "CYP2D6 is a polymorphic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of various drugs. At least 40-mutant alleles of CYP2D6 have been reported. CYP2D6*14, which is one of them found in Asian populations, causes deficient activity of CYP2D6. Four amino acid substitutions, P34S, G169R, R296C, and S486T, are present in the protein encoded by CYP2D6*14 (CYP2D6 14). Among them, G169R is thought to be a definitive substitution because it is unique to CYP2D6 14. However, a previous study showed that the activity of G169R-substituted CYP2D6 was about 40% of wild-type CYP2D6, suggesting that a combination of G169R and other substitutions may be required to abolish the activity of CYP2D6. In the present study, we examined the effects of combined substitutions of G169R and P34S on the functional properties of CYP2D6 and compared them with those of a single substitution of G169R or P34S using a cDNA expression system of V79 cells. The results showed that a combined substitution of G169R and P34S reduced the activities of CYP2D6 to less than the detection limit of our analytical method for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation. However, these activities were not completely abolished by a single substitution of P34S or G169R. The findings suggest that simultaneous substitution of G169R and P34S is crucial for almost completely abolishing the activity of CYP2D6 at least in V79 cells, although whether the absence of metabolism is due to the absence of functional protein or catalytic incompetency remains unclear because the levels of CYP2D6 protein expressed in V79 cells were too low to be determined by difference CO-reduced spectra.",

The mode of interaction with the enzyme is discussed based on the structure-activity relationship (SAR) data obtained for the synthesized inhibitors. Furthermore, the roles of three pharmacophores, a catechol moiety, a nitrile moiety, and acidic moieties, are discussed using in silico docking studies. More detailed biological evaluations of selected compounds are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2), a key transcriptional factor that regulates genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, is abundantly expressed in the human liver. However, studies on the molecular mechanism of human PXR gene regulation are limited. In this study, we examined the involvement of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha; NR2A1) in the transcriptional regulation of the human PXR gene in the human liver. The activities of the human PXR promoter containing the direct repeat 1 (DR1) element located at -88/-76 of the promoter were significantly increased by co-expression of HNF4alpha in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. In addition, introduction of mutation into the DR1 element abolished the transcriptional activation of the human PXR promoter by exogenous HNF4alpha. The results of gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that HNF4alpha was bound to the promoter region containing the DR1 element. A knock-down of HNF4alpha by siRNA significantly decreased expression levels of endogenous PXR mRNA in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, expression levels of PXR mRNA positively correlated with those of HNF4alpha mRNA in 18 human liver samples. These results suggested that HNF4alpha transactivated the human PXR gene by binding to the DR1 element located at -88/-76 of the promoter and was involved in the expression of PXR in the human liver.",

Rhesus monkeys were intravenously injected with18F-FDG and followed by 60 min of PET scanning. In the conscious state, the18F-FDG concentration reached a plateau 5 min after intravenous injection. Under ketamine anesthesia, the18F-FDG concentration gradually increased with time in all monitored regions. At 60 min after injection, the concentration in\n the striatum was about 3.2 times greater than that in the conscious state, and about 4.5 times greater in the cerebral cortex.\n Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the18F-FDG concentration in the occipital cortex was slightly lower.

        "abstract": "The effects of age on the binding of [11C]Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist of the central benzodiazepine receptor, were studied. Sixteen healthy male volunteers (21-78 years old) participated. Regional radioactivity in the brain was followed for 45 min by positron emission tomography after a bolus injection of [11C]Ro 15-4513. Similar tracer kinetics were observed in both young and old subjects. For the quantification of receptor binding in vivo, a compartment model, in which radioactivity in the pons was used as an input function, was applied. There were no significant changes in the binding potentials with age (P > 0.1) in ten brain regions. These observations delineate an interesting difference between central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors and other neurotransmitter receptors in the human brain measured by PET that have been shown to have a reduction with age.",

The CBCT records of approximately 150 patients were evaluated, and 17 accessory mental foramina were found in 16 patients. The anatomic peculiarities of the mandibular canal that might be relevant to endodontic treatment were observed. Accessory mental foramina tended to exist in the apical area of the first molar and posterior or inferior area of the mental foramen. The accessory branches of the mandibular canal showed common characteristics in the course of gently sloping posterosuperior direction in the buccal surface area. Verification of the existence of accessory mental foramina would prevent accessory nerve injury during periapical surgery. In root canal treatment, the possibility of accessory mental foramina-related nerve paresthesia seems low unless the mental foramen and mandibular canal are injured. Limited CBCT is effective for presurgical 3-dimensional assessment of the neurovascular structures in dentoalveolar treatment.",

Overexpression of ATF4 significantly enhanced the production of recombinant AT-III in CHO 13D-35D cells. The specific rate of AT-III production in the ATF4-overexpressed CHO 13D-35D cells reached approximately 23 pg/cell/day. After 144 h of incubation, the AT-III concentration in the culture supernatant was twofold greater compared to that observed with parental CHO 13D-35D cells. In contrast, ectopic expression of XBP-1s failed to enhance the production of recombinant AT-III in CHO 13D-35D cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed that high levels of XBP-1s mRNA were present in the CHO cells, regardless of ectopic expression of XBP-1s. Our results indicate that overexpression of the UPR transcription factor ATF4 is a promising means for improving the production of secreted protein pharmaceuticals in CHO cells.",

The second virial coefficient of rHSA, obtained from colloid osmotic pressure measurements at pH 6.7 ± 0.1 was not significantly different from that of pHSA ( P > 0.05). A 25% rHSA solution exhibited Newtonian flow, and the viscosity of 25% rHSA at 20 ± 0.02°C was not significantly different from that of 25% pHSA ( P > 0.05). We analyzed the long- and medium-chain fatty acid composition of rHSA by reverse-phase HPLC using 9-anthryldiazomethane as the fluorescent labeling reagent. The total amount of fatty acid was higher for pHSA than for rHSA. The fatty acid composition of the rHSA preparation was the same as that of the pHSA preparation. However, the amounts of palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) in rHSA were much lower than those in pHSA. Interestingly, we found that P. pastoris produced linolenic acid (C18:3) because it was detected in rHSA. The immunochemical properties of rHSA were analyzed by a parallel line assay method using anti-pHSA polyclonal antibody, and were identical to those of pHSA ( P > 0.05).",

        "abstract": "The addition of several kinds of fatty acid to the culture medium of a recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA)-producing yeast, Pichia pastoris, resulted in increased expression levels of the product. Among the fatty acids tested, a small amount of oleic acid (0.01% (w/v)) doubled the rHSA production level in a shake-flask culture when measured by the reversed passive hemagglutination assay method. To elucidate this phenomenon, studies were conducted using deletion mutants from the AOX2 promoter region. Deletion mutants, designed for a detailed evaluation of the methanol regulation elements (AOX2-UAS, AOX2-URS1, and AOX2-URS2) did not respond to the addition of oleic acid. However, a deletion mutant that was not lacking an upstream region from the AOX2 promoter showed a response to oleic acid. The results implied the presence of an oleic acid-responsive element between nucleotides (nt) -1529 and -803, and it may lie between nt -1411 and -1403 in the AOX2 promoter of P. pastoris. The response to oleic acid was shown to function even when the level of rHSA expression was increased by a mutation in the AOX2 promoter. Therefore addition of oleic acid to the medium is likely to play an important role, in cooperation with gene manipulation, in achieving high expression levels of rHSA for the purpose of commercial production.",

ONO-1714 was found to be 10-fold selective for human iNOS over human endothelial NOS (ecNOS). When the inhibitory activity of ONO-1714 was compared for iNOS, it was found to be 451-fold and >20,000-fold more potent than L-NMMA and aminoguanidine (AG), respectively. In terms of human iNOS selectivity, ONO-1714 was approximately 34- and 2-fold more selective for iNOS than L-NMMA and AG, respectively. ONO-1714 inhibited the LPS-induced elevation of plasma nitrate/nitrite in mice with an ID(50) value of 0.010 mg/kg, s.c. The maximum tolerated dose of ONO-1714 was 30 mg/kg, i.v. Thus, ONO-1714 represents one of the most potent iNOS inhibitors in vitro and in vivo to date and has great potentials for use as an inhibitor for clarifying the pathophysiological roles of iNOS and for use as a therapeutic agent.",

We used P. pastoris for the production of recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA). In several runs of fed-batch fermentation, rapid degradation of rHSA was observed, coinciding with a sudden increase of protease activity in the culture broth. Monitoring the changes in the concentration of the medium components during fermentation suggested that this phenomenon was caused by nitrogen starvation. Increased initial concentrations of ammonia and phosphoric acid in the medium prevented the protease production during fermentation. Using this improved medium, stable production of rHSA of around 1.4 g/l was achieved. Although protease activity in the culture broth of the improved medium was not detected by the casein plate method at the end of fermentation, potential protease activity remained and could be activated by decreasing the pH of the culture broth, a high degradation rate of 660 mg HSA/l/h was observed at pH 4.3, but degradation did not occur above pH 5.9.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is involved in intestinal carcinogenesis through its binding to the PGE(2) receptor subtypes EP(1) and EP(4) and activation of downstream pathways. ONO-8711 and ONO-AE2-227, prostaglandin E receptor subtype EP(1)- and EP(4)-selective antagonists, respectively, are known to suppress formation of intestinal polyps in adenomatous polyposis coli gene-deficient mice. The present study was designed to investigate the combined effects of EP(1) and EP(4) antagonists on spontaneous polyp formation in APC1309 mice in order to determine the contribution of each receptor to intestinal tumorigenesis. APC1309 mice were treated with 400 ppm of ONO-8711 alone, 400 ppm of ONO-AE2-227 alone or both in combination in the diet for 6 weeks. The mean area of polyps found in the intestine, calculated as the longer diameter x the shorter diameter x pi, was reduced by 12%, 43% (P < 0.01) and 56% (P < 0.01) of the mean control value (8.8 mm(2)) in the ONO-8711 alone, ONO-AE2-227 alone and combination treatment groups, respectively, suggesting clear additive effects of the combination. The same additive tendency for suppression was also observed with respect to the numbers of polyps in the intestine. Polyp size reduction was more remarkable with the EP(4) antagonist, while the number reduction was more pronounced with the EP(1) antagonist. Our results indicate that EP(1) and EP(4) may have separate intrinsic roles and, to some extent, contribute to polyp formation independently. Thus, combination treatment has potential for the chemoprevention of colon carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3) is a key transcriptional factor that regulates genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. However, studies on regulation of CAR target genes via up- or down-regulation of CAR are limited. In this study, we examined the effects of PPARalpha agonists (ciprofibrate, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and WY14643) on the expression of CAR and its target gene CYP2B1/2 in rat primary hepatocytes. Results from real-time PCR analysis showed that CAR and CYP2B1/2 mRNAs exhibit increases in response to all PPARalpha agonists studied (5 to 10-folds of control). Pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, completely suppressed increase in CYP2B1/2 mRNA in response to ciprofibrate, suggesting that protein synthesis is required in this process. In addition, the induction of CAR by ciprofibrate on the protein level was observed with nuclear extracts as well as total cell lysates. These results indicate that CYP2B1/2 mRNAs are induced by PPARalpha agonists and that this effect is accompanied by increase in the expression of CAR gene at both mRNA and nuclear protein levels. Activated PPARalpha may increase functional CAR protein, which can induce the expression of CAR target genes such as CYP2B.",

        "abstract": "Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is retained as an inactive form phosphorylated at threonine in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Upon activation, CAR is dephosphorylated to move into the nucleus and induces the transcription of genes. Thus, nuclear translocation is a key step for CAR activation in hepatocytes. However, this nuclear translocation has not been demonstrated in conventional two-dimensionally-cultured immortalized cell lines such as HepG2, in which CAR spontaneously accumulates in the nucleus. In this study, we showed that treatment with the indirect CAR activator phenobarbital activated transcription of the CYP3A4 gene in three-dimensionally (3D)-cultured HepG2 cells. CAR was retained as its phosphorylated form in the cytoplasm and was translocated to the nucleus in 3D-cultured HepG2 cells in response to treatment with phenobarbital. Moreover, okadaic acid and epidermal growth factor, were found to repress phenobarbital-induced CAR nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of the CYP3A4 gene promoter. These results suggested that 3D-cultured HepG2 cells properly regulated CAR activation as has been observed in hepatocytes.",

No changes in in vitro [3H]QNB binding were seen in autoradiograms of brain slices from irradiated rat. The irradiated side of the brain showed a significant increase in [3H]QNB binding in vivo in the striatum and cerebral cortex 24 h after irradiation. This increase in binding was transient, and had almost disappeared 2 weeks after irradiation. These results indicate that early changes in receptor function as a results of radiation damage are only detected in in-vivo conditions. In the striatum of the intact rat brain, an apparent positive cooperativity of binding was observed, which was more pronounced on the irradiated side.",

        "abstract": "To assess the effects of Ile359 to Leu359 change on CYP2C9-mediated metabolism, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and cDNA expression in yeast for CYP2C9 and examined in detail the kinetics of seven metabolic reactions by wild-type CYP2C9 (Ile359) and its Leu359 variant. For the metabolism of all the substrates studied, the Leu359 variant exhibited smaller Vmax/Km values than did the wild-type. The differences in the Vmax/Km values between the wild-type and the Leu359 variant varied from 3.4-fold to 26.9-fold. The Leu359 variant had higher Km values than did the wild-type for all the reactions studied. Among the seven reactions studied, the greatest difference in the Vmax values between the wild-type and the Leu359 variant was for piroxicam 5'-hydroxylation (408 versus 19 pmol/min/nmol P450), whereas there were no differences in the Vmax values between the wild-type and the Leu359 variant for diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and tolbutamide methylhydroxylation. These results indicate that the Ile359 to Leu359 change significantly decreases the catalytic activity of all the CYP2C9-mediated metabolisms studied, whereas the extent of the reduction in activity and changes of the kinetic parameters varies between substrates. Moreover, the amino acid substitution decreased the enantiomeric excess in the formation of 5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin from phenytoin.",

        "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is deeply involved in the metabolism of chemicals including pharmaceuticals. Therefore, polymorphisms of this enzyme have been widely studied to avoid unfavorable side effects of drugs in chemotherapy. In this work, we performed computational analysis of the mechanism of the decrease in enzymatic activity for three typical polymorphisms in CYP 2C9 species: *2, *3, and *5. Based on the equilibrated structure obtained by molecular dynamics simulation, the volume of the binding pocket and the fluctuation of amino residues responsible for substrate holding were compared between the wild type and the three variants. Further docking simulation was carried out to evaluate the appropriateness of the binding pocket to accommodate substrate chemicals. Every polymorphic variant was suggested to be inferior to the wild type in enzymatic ability from the structural viewpoint. F-G helices were obviously displaced outward in CYP2C9*2. Expansion of the binding pocket, especially the space near F' helix, was remarkable in CYP2C9*3. Disappearance of the hydrogen bond between K helix and β4 loop was observed in CYP2C9*5. The reduction of catalytic activity of those variants can be explained from the deformation of the binding pocket and the consequent change in binding mode of substrate chemicals. The computational approach is effective for predicting the enzymatic activity of polymorphic variants of CYP. This prediction will be helpful for advanced drug design because calculations forecast unexpected change in drug efficacy for individuals.",

        "abstract": "The effects of systemic administration of rolipram, a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, on [(3)H]2-deoxyglucose (DG) uptake in brain and peripheral tissues were examined. Rolipram significantly and dose-dependently decreased [(3)H]DG uptake in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. In contrast, the radioactivity concentrations in the plasma of rolipram-treated mice were significantly higher than those of control mice at all times after injection of the tracer. In the kinetic study, the initial uptake of [(3)H]DG in brain was decreased by rolipram, whereas no significant differences were observed in the uptake in heart and skeletal muscle. However, radioactivity concentrations in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle 30 min after the injection of [(3)H]DG were significantly lowered by rolipram to about 60%, 10% and 10% of control values, respectively. The uptake of [(13)N]ammonia in brain and heart of rolipram-treated mice was slightly decreased, which indicated that rolipram diminished both cerebral and cardiac blood flow. These results indicate that the phosphorylation process via hexokinase rather than the transport of [(3)H]DG might be depressed by rolipram. Together with the previous observations that inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) markedly enhanced [(14)C]DG uptake in rat brain, these results indicate an important role of the cAMP/PKA systems in the regulation of glucose metabolism in the living brain as well as in peripheral tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, we analyzed the function of a novel mutation (c.1628T>G, p.Leu543Trp) in the solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO) 1B1 gene, encoding organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, which was identified in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy. OATP1B1 variants carrying the mutation (OATP1B1*1a+c.1628T>G or *1b+c.1628T>G) showed a reduced transporting activity toward typical substrates and pravastatin compared with the activity of the references (OATP1B1*1a or *1b). This was due to reduction in V(max) values of the variants, not due to change in their K(m) values. OATP1B1*1b+c.1628T>G was normally expressed on the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells at the same level as that of OATP1B1*1b. Taken together, our results suggest that the mutation c.1628T>G (p.Leu543Trp) reduced the function of OATP1B1 probably due to decrease in turnover rate of one OATP1B1 molecule rather than impairment of protein sorting to the plasma membrane.",

        "abstract": "Mammalian carboxylesterases comprise a multigene family, the gene products of which are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. The carboxylesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of various xenobiotics and endogenous substrates such as ester, amide and thioester bonds and are thought to function mainly in drug metabolism. We have suggested the possibility that individual variation of human liver carboxylesterase activity causes the difference in expression levels of CES1A isozymes. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of human carboxylesterase genes. In the present study, we isolated two CES genes encoding human carboxylesterase CES1A, which were designated as CES1A1 (AB119997) and CES1A2 (AB119998). These genes were identical except for exon 1 and the 5' regulatory element. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of these two CES genes. A reporter gene assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Sp1 and C/EBPalpha could bind to each responsive element of the CES1A1 promoter but that the Sp1 and C/EBP could not bind to the responsive element of the CES1A2 promoter. Thus, CES1A1 mRNA expression level is much higher than the expression level of CES1A2 mRNA in the liver and lung. It is thought that these results provide information on individual variation of human carboxylesterase isozymes.",

        "abstract": "The effects of systemic administration of rolipram, a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, on [3H]2-deoxyglucose (DG) uptake in brain and peripheral tissues were examined. Rolipram significantly and dose-dependently decreased [3H]DG uptake in brain, heart and skeletal muscle. In contrast, the radioactivity concentrations in the plasma of rolipram-treated mice were significantly higher than those of control mice at all times after injection of the tracer. In the kinetic study, the initial uptake of [3H]DG in brain was decreased by rolipram, whereas no significant differences were observed in the uptake in heart and skeletal muscle. However, radioactivity concentrations in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle 30 min after the injection of [3H]DG were significantly lowered by rolipram to about 60%, 10% and 10% of control values, respectively. The uptake of [13N]ammonia in brain and heart of rolipram-treated mice was slightly decreased, which indicated that rolipram diminished both cerebral and cardiac blood flow. These results indicate that the phosphorylation process via hexokinase rather than the transport of [3H]DG might be depressed by rolipram. Together with the previous observations that inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) markedly enhanced [14C]DG uptake in rat brain, these results indicate an important role of the cAMP/PKA systems in the regulation of glucose metabolism in the living brain as well as in peripheral tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In the earliest stage of drug discovery/development, various cell-based models and animal models were used for the prediction of human pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics. Unfortunately, drugs under development are often discontinued because their nonclinical results do not extrapolate to human clinical studies in relation to either safety or efficacy. Therefore, it is important to improve the time- and cost-effectiveness of drug development. This might be achieved by developing new technologies including pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics models that use human and mouse artificial chromosome vectors (HACs/MACs). HACs/MACs are unique vectors with several advantages: 1) independent maintenance, 2) defined copy number and mitotically stable, 3) no silencing of the transgene, and 4) no limitation of DNA insertion size. This review provides information on the advantages and examples of the utility of various models based on the recent advances in HAC/MAC technologies, including multifunctional cell-based models for assaying drug–drug interactions, bidirectional permeability, and cytotoxicity, as well as fully genetically humanized mouse models. We also discuss the future prospects of these technologies to advance drug discovery. In summary, these technologies offer advantages over current conventional models and should improve the success rate of drug development related to efficacy and safety for humans.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of jaw movement has long been used as a measure for clinical diagnosis and treatment of prosthodontics, orthodontics, and oral surgery. However, prior analysis methods focus on the trajectory of the mandible or nearby points, and involve analysis which assumes a standard human bone shape or analysis which takes into consideration a portion of the shape of the mandible or other bones. Anatomically accurate assessment of the shape and motion of the bones overall for each patient is problematic. The authors have combined the morphological information for the bones of each subject obtained from CTs and the information on the movement of the mandible obtained from infrared markers set up on the teeth, and developed a system that can visualize and analyze in real time the state of the temporomandibular joint using real-time imaging technology. As a result, the three-dimensional shape of the mandible overall and its movements over time can be analyzed in real time quantitatively; in other words, analysis of jaw movement in four dimensions is possible. This system can be used to clarify the cause of bone deformations thought to result in jaw movement abnormalities, to assess treatment options for patients with temporomandibular joint illness, and to provide explanations to patients. Moreover, through further validation of its precision, the system may also be used clinically as a navigation system for dental therapy. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is believed to involve altered activation of dopamine receptors, and support for this hypothesis comes from the antipsychotic effect of antagonists of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). D2R is expressed most highly in the striatum, but most of the recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies have failed to show any change in D2R densities in the striatum of schizophrenics, raising the possibility that other receptors may also be involved. In particular, the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R), which is highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex, has been implicated in the control of working memory, and working memory dysfunction is a prominent feature of schizophrenia. We have therefore used PET to examine the distribution of D1R and D2R in brains of drug-naive or drug-free schizophrenic patients. Although no differences were observed in the striatum relative to control subjects, binding of radioligand to D1R was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics. This reduction was related to the severity of the negative symptoms (for instance, emotional withdrawal) and to poor performance in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. We propose that dysfunction of D1R signalling in the prefrontal cortex may contribute to the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "To obtain PET imaging of glucose metabolism in the brains of conscious rats, a method of rat head fixation was developed. PET measurement with microPET was performed for 60 min after 18F-FDG injection. Significant enhancement of glucose utilization in the right striatum was observed with infusion of Rp-adenosine-3,5-cyclic phosphorothioate triethylamine (Rp-cAMPS). FDG uptake increments were also seen in the ipsilateral frontal cortex and thalamus. As initial FDG uptake in the brain was not significantly altered by Rp-cAMPS, increased glucose metabolism might be due to an increase in the phosphorylation rate by hexokinase rather than the delivery process from plasma to the brain. In contrast to awake rats, the effect of Rp-cAMPS was abolished by anesthesia using chloral hydrate, indicating that neuronal activity has an important role in short term regulation of hexokinase activity through the cAMP/PKA system in the brain. These results strongly demonstrated the value of measuring glucose utilization in the brains of conscious rats.",

Eight normal male subjects lay in a sleeping bag through which air was blown, exposing subjects to cold air (8 degrees C) for 22 min. Each subject scored their degree of thermal comfort and discomfort every min. As the subjects reported more discomfort the blood oxygen level dependent response in the bilateral amygdala increased. There was no activation in the thalamus, somatosensory, cingulate, or insula cortices. This result suggests that the amygdala plays a role in the genesis of thermal discomfort due to cold.",

In vitro autoradiography data demonstrated an increase in the melatonin binding activity in the fetal (embryonic day 21) and early postnatal SCN (postnatal day 3) caused by maternal pinealectomy. This upregulation of the melatonin receptor in the SCN was then normalized after the melatonin system of the neonate started to work. The pregnant rats themselves did not show such a change in their melatonin receptors in the SCN following pinealectomy. Dopamine D1 receptor binding was affected by pinealectomy exclusively in the SCN of fetal and neonatal rats as well as in that of mothers. These results clearly indicate that the fetal circadian clock in the SCN is controlled and prepared before birth to some extent by maternal melatonin rhythm.",

        "abstract": "1. To investigate cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)-mediated metabolism in vivo, plasma concentrations of triazolam (TRZ) are often monitored as a CYP3A marker in CYP3A-humanised mice. However, it has not been determined whether plasma concentrations of TRZ after intravenous administration can reflect hepatic CYP3A activity in CYP3A-humanised mice. 2. Firstly, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of TRZ in wild-type and Cyp3a-knockout (Cyp3a-KO) mice. Plasma concentration profiles of TRZ and α-hydroxy (OH) TRZ were very similar in wild-type and Cyp3a-KO mice. On the other hand, AUC of 4-OH TRZ in Cyp3a-KO mice was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice. Pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) decreased the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) of TRZ and α-OH TRZ in both groups. There was no significant effect of PCN on AUC of 4-OH TRZ in Cyp3a-KO mice. 3. Next, we verified that AUC of 4-OH TRZ in CYP3A-humanised mice was higher than that in Cyp3a-KO mice, although the difference was not significant. 4. In conclusion, plasma concentrations of 4-OH TRZ, but not those of TRZ and α-OH TRZ, might reflect hepatic CYP3A activity in mice in vivo. These results provide important insights for in vivo studies using a CYP3A-humanised model.",

        "abstract": "P-Glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene in humans and by Mdr1a and Mdr1b genes in rodents, is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Since P-gp is constitutively expressed in numerous tissues and exhibits a broad specificity in substrate recognition, it can play a crucial role in limiting the absorption and distribution of xenobiotics by decreasing their intracellular accumulation. The expression of P-gp is regulated by various nuclear receptors such as pregnane X receptor (PXR). Although the characterization of P-gp induction by PXR ligands is a crucial goal for predicting pharmacokinetics of drugs, findings regarding the induction of P-gp by PXR ligands in vivo are still controversial. In this study, we examined the effect of pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a murine PXR ligand, on the expression of Mdr1a/1b mRNA and P-gp protein in the intestine, brain and liver of mice. The results showed that PCN increased the expression of both Mdr1a/1b mRNA and P-gp protein in the intestine and the brain. The present study provided the first evidence that P-gp is inducible by PCN in the large intestine. The results also showed that P-gp protein was induced by PCN in the cortex but not in the whole brain. On the other hand, PCN increased the expression of Mdr1a/1b mRNA in the liver, although no increase was observed in the expression of P-gp protein. These results suggested different effect of PCN on the expression of P-gp protein in the intestine, brain and liver of mice.",

        "abstract": "Treatment with benzbromarone can be associated with liver injury, but the detailed mechanism remains unknown. Our recent studies demonstrated that benzbromarone was metabolized to 1',6-dihydroxybenzbromarone and followed by formation of reactive intermediates that were trapped by glutathione, suggesting that the reactive intermediates may be responsible for the liver injury. The aim of this study was to clarify whether the reactive intermediates derived from 1',6-dihydroxybenzbromarone is a risk factor of liver injury in mice. An incubation study using mouse liver microsomes showed that the rates of formation of 1',6-dihydroxybenzbromarone from benzbromarone were increased by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Levels of a hepatic glutathione adduct derived from 1',6-dihydroxybenzbromarone were increased by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Furthermore, plasma alanine amino transferase activities were increased in mice treated with benzbromarone after pretreatment with dexamethasone. The results suggest that the reactive intermediate derived from 1',6-dihydroxybenzbromarone may be associated with liver injury.",

        "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the  gene in humans and by the  genes in rodents, is expressed in numerous tissues and plays as an efflux pump to limit the distribution and absorption of many drugs. Owing to species differences of P-gp between humans and rodents, it is difficult to predict the impact of P-gp on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of P-gp substrates in humans from results of animal experiments. Therefore, we generated a novel P-gp humanized mouse model by using a mouse artificial chromosome (MAC) vector [designated human MDR1-MAC (hMDR1-MAC) mice]. The results showed that hMDR1 mRNA was expressed in various tissues of hMDR1-MAC mice. Furthermore, expression of human P-gp protein was detected in the brain capillary fraction and plasma membrane fraction of intestinal epithelial cells isolated from hMDR1-MAC mice, although the expression levels of intestinal P-gp protein were extremely low. Thus, we evaluated the function of human P-gp at the blood-brain barrier of hMDR1-MAC mice. The brain-to-plasma ratios of P-gp substrates in hMDR1-MAC mice were much lower than those in Mdr1a/1b-knockout mice, and the brain-to-plasma ratio of paclitaxel was significantly increased by pretreatment with a P-gp inhibitor in hMDR1-MAC mice. These results indicated that the hMDR1-MAC mice are the first P-gp humanized mice expressing functional human P-gp at the blood-brain barrier. This mouse is a promising model to evaluate species differences of P-gp between humans and mice in vivo and to estimate the brain distribution of drugs in humans while taking into account species differences of P-gp.",

        "abstract": "11C-labeled cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists, 3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-[11C]methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine- 3-yl)-N'-(3-methylphenyl)urea ([11C]L-365,260) and its (S)-enantiomer ([11C]L-365,346), have been synthesized and evaluated in vivo for use in CCK receptor studies with positron emission tomography (PET). Selective N-methylation of a racemic precursor with [11C]iodomethane and subsequent optical resolution of the racemate with HPLC afforded optically pure [11C]L-365,260 and [11C]L-365,346, which are selective for CCK-B (central-type) receptors and CCK-A (peripheral-type) receptors, respectively. Biodistribution studies in mice showed very low brain uptakes (<0.8% dose/gram) of the radioactivities after intravenous injections of these compounds, although that of brain CCK-B receptor-selective [11C]L-365,260 was 2-fold that of [11C]L-365,346. In peripheral organs, uptake of the radioactivity in the pancreas was the highest among the organs tested after the injection of [11C]L-365,346 and was 3-fold that of [11C]L-365,260. It was also observed that high uptake of [11C]L-365,346 in rat pancreas was significantly inhibited by a simultaneous injection with a large dose of L-365,346 (3 mg/kg). These preliminary results suggest that the nonpeptide CCK antagonist [11C]L-365,346 may be useful for probing pancreatic CCK-A receptors by PET. Owing to the very low brain permeability, however, [11C]L-365,260 may have no potential as a PET tracer for probing brain CCK-B receptors.",

        "abstract": "SLCO1B1*5 and SLCO1B1*15 have been reported to reduce the clearance of pravastatin in healthy volunteers. However, there remains controversy in the effects of SLCO1B1*5 on the activity of OATP1B1 in vitro. In addition, the effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the function of OATP1B1 has not been studied using cDNA-expression systems. Object of the present study was to study the influence of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, a novel haplotype found in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy, on the functional properties of OATP1B1 by transient expression systems of HEK293 and HeLa cells using endogenous conjugates and statins as substrates.Transporting assays for endogenous substrates were performed using tritium labeled estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and estrone-3-sulfate. Quantitation of pravastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin were carried out using HPLC tandem mass spectrometry.The transporting activities of cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G decreased significantly but those of SLCO1B1*1b, *1a+C1007G and *1b+C1007G were not altered for all of the substrates tested except for simvastatin. Kinetic analysis of pravastatin and atorvastatin showed that Km values were not altered but Vmax values decreased significantly in cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G. Immunocytochemical study showed that SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G proteins are localized not only at the plasma membrane but also in the intracellular space.These findings suggest that 521T>C, existing commonly in SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, is the key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that determines the functional properties of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G allelic proteins and that decreased activities of these variant proteins are mainly caused by a sorting error produced by this SNP.",

        "abstract": "Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor that inactivates several coagulation proteases, primarily thrombin and factor Xa. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line transfected with a vector expressing recombinant human antithrombin (rAT) and a selectable marker, glutamine synthetase (GS), was cultivated in a 2-l fed-batch culture process using serum-free, glutamine-free medium. To maximize the rAT yield, effects of culture pH, balanced amino acid feeding, and an increased glutamate concentration on cell metabolism and rAT production were investigated. When cells were grown at pH values of 6.6, 6.8, 7.0, and 7.2, the maximum cell density and maximum lactate concentration decreased with decreasing pH. The highest production level of rAT was obtained at culture pH 6.8 due to the extended culture lifetime. Compared to the imbalanced amino acid feeding at culture pH 6.8, the balanced amino acid feeding increased the amount of rAT activity by 30% as a result of an increased viable cell number. A decrease in the specific glucose consumption rate (q(Glc)) with increasing culture time was observed in all the above-mentioned experiments, while the glucose concentration was maintained above 0.7 g l(-1). In addition, a decrease in the specific rAT production rate (q(rAT)) was observed after the depletion of lactate in the late cultivation stage. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduced availability of cellular energy caused by the decrease in q(Glc) and depletion of lactate led to the decrease in q(rAT). This decrease in q(rAT) was partially prevented by increasing the residual glutamate concentration from 1 mM to 7 mM, thus resulting in an additional 30% increase in the amount of rAT activity. The optimized fed-batch culture process yielded 1.0 g l(-1) rAT at 287 h of cultivation.",

        "abstract": "1. The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its possible mechanisms on the first ovulation were investigated in immature female rats. The first ovulation was induced by administration of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) at 0800 h at 26 days of age. 2. A single s.c. injection of 360 mg x kg(-1) CBZ at 1300 h on the first pro-oestrus (day 28) completely inhibited the first ovulation on the morning of day 29. A marked elevation in 13, 14-dihydro-prostaglandin F2alpha (13, 14H2-PGF2alpha) forming capacity, a sensitive indicator of luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, was not detected in the CBZ-treated group at 0800 h on day 29 (72 h after eCG treatment). The elevation in serum LH levels at 57 h after eCG treatment was not observed in the CBZ-treated group, either. The blocking of the first ovulation and 13, 14H2-PGF2alpha forming capacity were recovered by an i.p. injection of human CG on day 28 in all animals. 3. However, the first ovulation was not blocked by repeated injections of 360 mg x kg(-1) CBZ at 1300 h once daily for 3 days (days 26 - 28). The repeated injections of CBZ caused a great fall (64% decrease) in the serum levels of CBZ at 4 h after the final CBZ injection as compared with the case of a single injection of CBZ and resulted in a delay for 5 h the occurrence of LH surge, which is normally observed around 57 h after eCG injection. 4. A significant increase in the activity of microsomal CBZ catabolism by the repeated injections of CBZ was quantitatively verified by the HPLC analysis. But, the activity of CBZ metabolism in the single injected-animals showed almost similar levels to that in the control. 5. The present results demonstrated that a single injection of CBZ blocks the ovulation by inhibiting LH surge but that the failure of the inhibition of ovulation by repeated injections of CBZ is due to a decrease in serum CBZ levels mediated through CBZ-induced hepatic enzyme induction.",

The subjects were 10 neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients, 7 schizophrenic patients who were drug-free but had previously been treated with neuroleptics, and 12 normal controls. A non-significant trend towards decreased prefrontal [11C]NMSP binding was observed in the neuroleptic-treated patients, suggesting a possible effect of previous neuroleptic treatment on the alteration in cortical 5-HT2 function. However, the neuroleptic-naive patients showed no noticeable difference in cortical [11C]NMSP binding compared to controls. Our results do not rule out the role of 5-HT2 function as a crucial site of therapeutic activity of schizophrenia, but they do suggest that cortical 5-HT2 receptors might not be primarily involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Iodine-123-labelled 3ß-(4-iodophenyl)tropane-2ß-carboxylic acid ([123I]ß-CIT) labels both the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and this ligand is able to clarify pathological changes in both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. However, the differential kinetics of ß-CIT binding to DAT and 5-HTT has not been clarified fully. In this study we examined time-activity curves of [123I]ß-CIT in individual regions in the rat brain. Using cerebellum as the reference region,k3 andk4 values were estimated by a two-compartment kinetic analysis. In the striatum, the kinetics was slowest among all brain areas. In this area specific binding reached its peak 4 h after the injection. In the hypothalamus, specific binding reached its peak 1 h after the injection and its amount did not change until 4 h after the injection. In the occipital cortex, the binding and washout of the ligand were fastest among all brain regions. Estimatedk3 values were 0.040±0.003 in the striatum, 0.019±0.002 in the hypothalamus and 0.082±0.011 in the occipital cortex (min-t, mean ±SD). Estimatedk4 values were 0.0034±0.0005 in the striatum, 0.0071±0.0009 in the hypothalamus and 0.083±0.013 in the occipital cortex (min-1, mean ±SD). Therefore binding kinetics of [123I]ß-CIT in the region rich in DAT is apparently different from that in the region rich in 5-HTT. These results will provide fundamental data to image both DAT and 5-HTT in one series of examinations with [123I]ß-CIT.",

        "abstract": "Many reports support the concept of serotonergic-dopaminergic interaction in the brain. However, at present, there are few methods to study this relationship in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitor, clomipramine, on a dopamine (DA) transporter ligand, [123I]&#35-CIT (RTI-55), in rat brain. Dose-dependent changes in [123I]&#35-CIT specific binding induced by clomipramine were studied in the striatum (rich in DA transporter) and the hypothalamus (rich in 5-HT transporter). The changes in the time-activity curves of [123I]&#35-CIT specific binding after clomipramine injection were also examined in these two regions. Using the cerebellum as the reference region, k3 and k4 values with and without clomipramine administration were estimated by a two-compartment kinetic analysis. Clomipramine inhibited [123I]&#35-CIT specific binding in the hypothalamus, but enhanced its specific binding in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analysis showed that k3 in the striatum was increased by 55%. In conclusion, enhancement of [123I]&#35-CIT binding in the striatum after clomipramine administration indicated the possibility of 5-HT-DA interaction.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the production of recombinant human antithrombin (rAT) by the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. In preliminary methanol-limited fed-batch fermentation, the rAT concentration reached 324 mg/l at 192 h of cultivation, but the specific heparin cofactor (HC) activity of rAT in the culture supernatant was 10% of that of plasma-derived antithrombin (pAT). To improve the specific HC activity of rAT, effort was first focused on the optimization of culture pH and media composition, resulting in protection of rAT against pH-dependent instability and proteolytic degradation. However, even in the optimized methanol-limited fed-batch fermentation, the specific HC activity of rAT in the culture supernatant was still 20% that of pAT. To investigate the unknown mechanisms involved in the decreased specific HC activity of rAT, the culture supernatant of mock-transfected cells was prepared by methanol-limited fed-batch fermentation. When pAT was added to this supernatant, a rapid decrease in HC activity was observed; the residual HC activity was 26% after 24 h of incubation at 25 degrees C. The loss of pAT activity was prevented by addition of a formaldehyde scavenger, amino urea, to the supernatant. In addition, alcohol oxidase activity was observed in the supernatant, resulting in the accumulation of formaldehyde in the culture broth. These results suggest that the formaldehyde produced by methanol oxidation in the culture broth of P. pastoris might decrease the HC activity of rAT during fermentation. Replacing the methanol with glycerol as the carbon source improved the specific HC activity of rAT from 20% to above 40% of that of pAT. In the glycerol-limited fed-batch fermentation, rAT is expressed at 100 mg/l under the control of the truncated mutated AOX2 promoter.",

        "abstract": "Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was microinjected into rat cerebral cortex and changes in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) binding and benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) binding were followed for 24 h after the infusion using [(3)H]-N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate ([(3)H]-NMPB) and [(3)H]-flumazenil, respectively, as a radioligand. The microinjection of SNP dose-dependently caused significant neural cell death 3 h after infusion, with the area of cell death becoming extensive 24 h after infusion. Neither SIN-1 nor NOC-18, other types of NO donors, caused neural cell death. Together with the result that deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent, protected SNP-induced brain injury indicated important roles of iron-related radicals in SNP cytotoxicity in rat brain. In vitro [(3)H]-NMPB binding was significantly reduced in parallel with the time course of neural cell death detected by TTC staining and Nissl staining. In contrast, [(3)H]-flumazenil binding was essentially unaltered during the 24-h period after the SNP infusion. Similar results were observed in in vivo binding experiments. In vivo [(3)H]-NMPB binding was found to be much more sensitive at detecting cell death caused by SNP. On the other hand, [(3)H]-flumazenil binding in vivo was relatively insensitive to SNP-induced cell death. These results indicate that mAChR binding may be superior to BZR binding for detecting cell death in brain tissue, in contrast to what was previously thought.",

A highly sensitive method using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with postcolumn derivatization was developed to measure the liberated formaldehyde as N- and O-demethylase activity of drugs in human liver microsomes. Following the chromatographic separation of formaldehyde on a C18 column, the formaldehyde was reacted with the Nash reagent in the postcolumn reactor at 100 degrees C and detected by the fluorescence method. The results showed that the present method has excellent precision and accuracy. The intra- and interassay variances of this method were less than 10%. The newly developed HPLC method was found to be about 80-fold more sensitive than the colorimetric method in detection of formaldehyde. The N-demethylase activity of sertraline in rat liver microsomes determined by the present method did not differ from those detected by previous methods quantifying produced desmethyl metabolite. The present method has been successfully applied to determine the N-demethylase activities of several drugs, including aminopyrine, erythromycin, fluoxetine, S-mephenytoin, and sertraline, in human liver microsomes. This assay should be useful for generic analysis of N- and O-demethylase activities of xenobiotic and endobiotic chemicals by CYP enzymes.",

Abscopal effect might depend upon the activation of antitumor immune response. However, such responses induced by thermal ablation had been thought to be usually weak and that they rarely induce distant tumor regression. Recently, results of several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that thermal ablation can induce therapeutically effective systemic antitumor immune response if appropriate immunomodulators are combined. To elucidate the mechanisms of these promising strategies, effects of thermal ablation on the immune system are overviewed. Furthermore, recent promising preclinical and clinical studies examining enhancement of systemic antitumor immune response by combining thermal ablation and immunomodulation are summarized.",

A significant enhancement in glucose metabolism, as measured using [14C]deoxyglucose (DG), was observed throughout widespread areas of the cerebral cortex within 1 h of microinjection of 50 nmol/microl SNP. Using a kinetic analysis, the increase in glucose metabolism was found to be due to an increase in the phosphorylation of [14C]DG in the brain. On the other hand, regional cerebral blood flow, as measured using [14C]iodoantypirine, was not significantly altered by the SNP infusion. No significant cell death was detected by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining 1 h after the SNP infusion. The uncoupling of flow and metabolism was almost completely prevented by pretreatment with an NMDA antagonist, MK-801. However, pretreatment with MK-801 did not prevent the SNP-induced neural cell death detected 6 h after the SNP infusion. These results suggest that the SNP-induced uncoupling of flow and metabolism was not directly related to neural cell death in the cerebral cortex.",

        "abstract": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyze phase-II biotransformation reaction of a variety of substances. Among the UGT1A isoforms, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 are predominantly expressed in the liver. Interindividual variability in expression of these isoforms would cause interindividual differences in drug response, toxicity and cancer susceptibility. In the present study, we investigated the interindividual variability in UGT1A mRNA expression and whether hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and HNF4alpha were factors responsible for their variability in human livers. The amounts of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha mRNA in 18 human livers were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The largest and smallest interindividual differences in expression levels were observed in UGT1A1 (8.6-fold) and UGT1A4 (2.5-fold) mRNA, respectively. The amounts of HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha mRNA were strongly correlated with the amount of UGT1A9 mRNA and moderately correlated with that of UGT1A6 mRNA, whereas no significant correlation was found with the amounts of UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 mRNA. Our results suggest that HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha are the factors involved in the interindividual variability of UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 mRNA expression. Further studies of other transcription factors are needed to clarify the factor(s) determining the interindividual variations in UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 mRNA expression.",

Methods: MR images of 68 joints (2 males, 32 females) were used. The subjects were classified into three groups: with/without defects of cortical bone groups and a combination group without defects. The AFS was measured as the length between the protrusive point and the apex of the condyle on MRI (4-mm-thick slices), and the quad value of the length was defined as the area on the slice. The summed quad values of all slices were used as the AFS area. Differences in the areas among the three groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: The non-defect group had significantly larger AFS areas than the defect group. Conclusions: Quantitative measurement on MR images clarified the changes in the condylar sagittal appearance.",

The vertical distance from a reference point to the alveolar ridge was measured by caliper on the sliced mandible, and measurement error on the CT images was calculated in percentages based on the actual values and the measurement values obtained from the CT images.Measurement error was determined to range from 0 to 1.11 mm (0% to 6.9%) on SCT and from 0.01 to 0.65 mm (0.1% to 5.2%) on LCBCT, with measurement errors of 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively (P < .0001).This study suggests that distance can be measured accurately using LCBCT. The size of the rectangular solid images obtained using LCBCT (30 mm wide and 42.7 mm long) is thought to be adequate for observation of mandibular bony structure and for preoperative assessment before dental implant placement.In this experiment on cadaver mandibles, LCBCT was shown to be a useful tool for preoperative evaluation in dental surgery because the relatively small field size of its images limits the patient's exposure to radiation.",

        "abstract": "The binding kinetics of11C-N-methyl piperidyl benzilate (11C-NMPB) in rhesus monkey brain were studied using animal positron emission tomography (PET) (SHR2000). This study is intended\n to assess the validity of the method using the cerebellum as a reference region, and to evaluate the effects of anesthesia\n on11C -NMPB binding. Two monkeys, anesthetized with ketamine, received intravenous11C-NMPB alone (370–760 MBq, μg/kg) or mixed with varying doses of nonradioactive NMPB (3 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg, 30 μg/kg) and were subjected to PET scans for 60 minutes.\n Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on reconstructed PET images and a time-activity curve was obtained for each region.11C-NMPB accumulated densely in the striatum and cerebral cortex with time. In contrast, the tracer accumulation significantly\n decreased with increased doses of nonradio-active NMPB. In the cerebellum, on the other hand, the accumulation of11C-NMPB remained low and the tracer was slowly eliminated from the brain following the injection.11C-NMPB binding in the cerebellum was barely affected by the increased dose of nonradioactive NMPB. We thus concluded that\n the specific11C-NMPB binding was negligible in the cerebellum, and performed simplified evaluation of11C-NMPB binding in each brain region by a graphical method using the cerebellum as a reference region. PET was conducted 26\n times, in total both in ketamine-anesthetized and awake monkeys (n = 3 each). Measurements of11C-NMPB binding showed good run-to-run reproducibility within individual animals. When11C-NMPB binding was compared between ketamine-treated and awake animals, a significant increase in11C-NMPB binding was observed in the striatum but not in other brain regions of ketamine-treated animals.",

Treatment with either flunitrazepam or NNC-711 reduced the specific binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone in the striatum. Flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, blocked the effect of flunitrazepam, indicating that the reduction in specific binding in the striatum was mediated via the GABAergic system. The flunitrazepam significantly decreased the specific binding of [3H]N-methylspiperone in the striatum at all time points studied after tracer injection, whereas specific binding in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex was unaltered. This decrease in specific binding in the striatum was found to be due to a reduced input rate constant (k3) of [3H]N-methylspiperone. The maximum number of the binding sites available for dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum was not changed by the flunitrazepam treatment.",

We had to consider not only proteins from host cells as impurities but also mannan, which exhibits harmful effects on humans. However, the analysis of mannan in biopharmaceuticals produced from yeast has not been reported. Contaminating mannans in the final product were one important index to assess the clinical safety of rHSA. We have developed a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA), utilizing an avidin-biotin system, for the detection of either the protein or mannan polysaccharide components from P. pastoris components (PPC) in rHSA. In addition, we used anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (AE-PAD) for monosaccharide analysis of glycoconjugates for the detection of mannan from PPC in rHSA. The detection limits of the EIA for PPC (PPC EIA) and the AE-PAD were 1 ng of protein/250 mg of rHSA and 180 ng of mannose/mg of rHSA, respectively. The mannan content in partially purified rHSA as determined by the AE-PAD was about same as the PPC content as determined by the PPC EIA. We showed that the PPC EIA and the AE-PAD are useful methods for the purity analysis of biopharmaceuticals produced from yeast.",

        "abstract": "Prourokinase (proUK)-annexin V chimeras expressed by the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris in a synthetic medium as part of a system designed to yield a novel thrombolytic agent are degraded, as it is thought, by various yeast proteases present in the culture supernatant. Minimization of proteolysis was therefore investigated to increase the yield of intact proUK-annexin V. Protease inhibitor screening study indicated several proteases including at least serine protease like chymotrypsin were involved in the proteolysis. Addition of more than 10% of peptone or more than 0.2 mol l(-1) of arginine to the medium was effective in minimizing proteolysis in shake-flask culture. Culture condition of higher pH was also effective, however, induced a cell death. Cell improvement by increasing the methanol utilization ability yielded greater tolerance to high pH. As a result, the culture condition with highly concentrated peptone solution fed under controlled conditions of pH 8.0 was established, which greatly reduced proteolytic degradation in fed-batch fermentation. These optimal conditions, which enabled fibrinolytic activity to reach 7800 IU ml(-1), could easily be applied in industrial scale production.",

        "abstract": "Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a drug commonly used in endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer, although it is known to cause thrombosis as a serious side effect. Recently, we found that cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) mainly catalyzed the metabolism of MPA via CYP in human liver microsomes. However, the metabolic products of MPA in humans and rats have not been elucidated. In addition, it is not clear whether thrombosis could be induced by MPA itself or by its metabolites. In this study, we determined the overall metabolism of MPA as the disappearance of the parent drug from an incubation mixture, and identified the enzymes catalyzing the metabolism of MPA via CYP in rats. Moreover, the effects of CYP-modulators on MPA-induced hypercoagulation in vivo were examined. Intrinsic clearance of MPA in rat liver microsomes was increased by treatment with CYP3A-inducers. The intrinsic clearance of MPA in liver microsomes of rats treated with various CYP-inducers showed a significant correlation with CYP3A activity, but not CYP1A activity, CYP2B activity or CYP2C contents. Among the eight recombinant rat CYPs studied, CYP3A1, CYP3A2 and CYP2A2 catalyzed the metabolism of MPA. However, since CYP3A2 and CYP2A2 are male-specific isoforms, CYP3A1 appears to be mainly involved in the metabolism of MPA in liver microsomes of female rats. In an in vivo study, pretreatment of female rats with SKF525A, an inhibitor of CYPs including CYP3A1, significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced MPA-induced hypercoagulation, whereas pretreatment with phenobarbital, an inducer of CYPs including CYP3A1, reduced it. These findings suggest that CYP-catalyzed metabolism of MPA is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A1 and that MPA-induced hypercoagulation is predominantly caused by MPA itself in female rats.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing rapidly in many countries, resulting in rising societal costs of the care of thyroid cancer. We reported that the active surveillance of low-risk papillary microcarcinoma had less unfavorable events than immediate surgery, while the oncological outcomes of these managements were similarly excellent. Here we calculated the medical costs of these two managements. We created a model of the flow of these managements, based on our previous study. The flow and costs include the step of diagnosis, surgery, prescription of medicine, recurrence, salvage surgery for recurrence, and care for 10 years after the diagnosis. The costs were calculated according to the typical clinical practices at Kuma Hospital performed under the Japanese Health Care Insurance System. If conversion surgeries were not considered, the 'simple cost' of active surveillance for 10 years was 167,780 yen/patient. If there were no recurrences, the 'simple cost' of immediate surgery was calculated as 794,770 yen/patient to 1,086,070 yen/patient, depending on the type of surgery and postoperative medication. The 'simple cost' of surgery was 4.7 to 6.5 times the 'simple cost' of surveillance. When conversion surgeries and recurrence were considered, the 'total cost' of active surveillance for 10 years became 225,695 yen/patient. When recurrence were considered, the 'total cost' of immediate surgery was 928,094 yen/patient, which was 4.1 times the 'total cost' of the active surveillance. At Kuma Hospital in Japan, the 10-year total cost of immediate surgery was 4.1 times expensive than active surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Oxyphilic cell carcinoma is a relatively rare type of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. We investigated the diagnosis of oxyphilic cell carcinoma based on surgical specimens and cytology to elucidate the indications for surgery for oxyphilic tumors. Among 330 patients pathologically diagnosed as having an oxyphilic cell carcinoma or adenoma, the incidence of carcinoma was 21%. The pathological diagnosis of oxyphilic cell carcinoma was related to tumor size (>4 cm). On cytology, 79% of the tumors were classified as category IV or greater by the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC), but no significant difference was established between category IV or greater and categories I-III regarding the incidence of carcinoma. Of 998 patients cytologically diagnosed as having oxyphilic cell tumors (BSRTC category IV), 426 underwent surgery and 66 (15%) were diagnosed as malignancies. In a univariate analysis, serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (>500 ng/dL) for anti-Tg antibody-negative patients, tumor size (>4 cm) and US class (≥3) significantly predicted malignant histology. A multivariate logistic analysis revealed that US finding was an independent predictor of malignant histology, and tumor size (>4 cm) also predicted malignancy when the Tg level was excluded from the variables. These findings suggest that, for thyroid tumors diagnosed as oxyphilic follicular neoplasms on cytology, surgical indications are tumors with US class ≥3, tumor size >4 cm, and Tg >500 ng/dL (with negative Tg-antibody). It is not appropriate to perform surgery for all cases for a precise histological classification, unlike the BSRTC recommendation.",

Based on this recommendation, it is predicted that the equivalent dose limit of our crystalline lens can be lowered in the near future. Therefore, it is important to grasp the current situation of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study is to measure the crystalline lens of surgeons by focusing on the CT-fluoroscopy guided interventional radiology's (IVRs). We also examined whether the exposure dose of the crystalline lens can be correctly evaluated by measuring the unequal exposure dose of the neck, which is usually used for the unequal exposure measurement. Results of the analysis of 200 CT-fluoroscopy guided IVR procedures showed that the unequal exposure dose of the neck was significantly correlated with the exposure dose of the crystalline lens which was measured near the left eye ball (R=0.83). However, the exposure dose of the crystalline was 33% lower than those of the neck. Therefore, although the individual dosimeter worn on the neck can be used as the useful index of the exposure dose of the crystalline lens, the results can be overestimated.",

        "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes metabolize approximately half of all drugs on the market. Since the endogenous compounds 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) are generated from cholesterol via CYP3A enzymes, we examined whether the plasma levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC reflect hepatic CYP3A4 activity by using a CYP3A-humanized mouse model, in which the function of endogenous Cyp3a was genetically replaced by human CYP3A. CYP3A-humanized mice have great advantages for evaluation of the relationship between hepatic CYP3A protein levels and plasma and hepatic levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC. Levels of CYP3A4 protein in the liver microsomes of CYP3A-humanized mice were increased by treatment with pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile, a CYP3A inducer. Hepatic and plasma levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC normalized by cholesterol were significantly correlated with hepatic CYP3A4 protein levels. In addition, in vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the formation of 4β-HC was strongly inhibited by a CYP3A inhibitor, while the inhibitory effect of the CYP3A inhibition on the formation of 25-HC was weak. These results suggested that CYP3A mainly contributed to the formation of 4β-HC in human liver microsomes, whereas other factors may be involved in the formation of 25-HC. In conclusion, the in vivo studies using CYP3A-humanized mice suggest that plasma 4β-HC and 25-HC levels reflect hepatic CYP3A4 activity. Furthermore, taking the results of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes into consideration, 4β-HC is a more reliable biomarker of hepatic CYP3A activity.",

        "abstract": "The effects of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-related compounds on in vivo [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding to striatal dopamine D(1) receptors were investigated using autoradiography in order to clarify the possible regulation of the cAMP-dependent mechanisms in the in vivo ligand-receptor bindings in the living brain. Intrastriatal infusion of the cAMP analogue, N6,2'-O-dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP; 5, 25 and 100 nmol/side) produced a dose-dependent increase of in vivo [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding in conscious rats. This increasing effect of [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding completely disappeared by 6 h after the infusion of db-cAMP. A similar increase of in vivo [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding to striatal D(1) receptors was also observed by intrastriatal injection of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8Br-cAMP, 100 nmol/side). Pretreatment with Rp-cyclic AMP triethylamine (Rp-cAMPS, 100 nmol/side), an inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), completely blocked the increasing effect of [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding induced by db-cAMP. In contrast, in vitro [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding was not significantly altered by intrastriatal infusion of db-cAMP, which indicated that the maximum number of binding sites (B(max)) for D(1) receptors was not changed. The kinetic analysis employed the graphical method indicated that a db-cAMP-induced increase of in vivo [(3)H]SCH 23390 binding was mainly due to an increase in the bimolecular association rate constant (k(on)). These results strongly indicate that the PKA-mediated phosphorylation may play a pivotal role in the regulating the in vivo [(3)H]SCH 23390 dopamine D(1) receptor binding in intact rat brain.",

        "abstract": "We assessed the relationship between the metabolism of R- and S-mephobarbital (MPB) and genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2B6. Nine homozygous extensive metabolizers (homo-EMs, 2C19*1/2C19*1) of CYP2C19, ten heterozygous EMs (hetero-EMs, 2C19*1/2C19*2, 2C19*1/2C19*3) and eleven poor metabolizers (PMs, 2C19*2/2C19*2, 2C19*3/2C19*3, 2C19*2/2C19*3) recruited from a Japanese population, received an oral 200 mg-dose of racemic MPB. Blood and urine samples were collected, and R-MPB, S-MPB and the metabolites, phenobarbital (PB) and 4'-hydroxy-MPB, were measured. Each subject was also genotyped for CYP2B6 gene.The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of R-MPB was 92-fold greater in PMs than in homo-EMs. R/S ratios for AUC of MPB were much higher in PMs than in EMs (homo- and hetero-). The cumulative urinary excretion of 4'-hydroxy-MPB up to 24 h postdose was 21-fold less in PMs than in homo-EMs. The metabolic ratio of AUCPB/(AUCS-MPB + AUCR-MPB) was higher in PMs than in EMs (homo- and hetero-). In addition, this metabolic ratio was lower in the carriers of CYP2B6*6 compared with that in its non-carriers.Our results indicate that the 4'-hydroxylation of R-MPB is mediated via CYP2C19 and that the rapid 4'-hydroxylation of R-MPB results in a marked difference in the pharmacokinetic profiles between R-MPB and S-MPB in the different CYP2C19 genotypic individuals. In addition, a minor fraction of the interindividual variability in PB formation from MPB may be explainable by the CYP2B6*6 allele.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic programming method was applied to obtain the optimal specific growth rate, mu, in the fed-batch fermentation using the recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA)-producing yeast, Pichia pastoris. Based on the relationship between the specific production rate, varrho, and the specific growth rate, mu, a simple mathematical model describing the growth and rHSA production was constructed and used for calculations. Two constraints, final volume and maximum methanol feed rate, were adopted for calculations and the optimal mu resulted as follows. That is, mu was initially at the maximum value, mu(max), then decreased gradually. Finally, mu decreased to the mu(min) that gave a maximum varrho. The decline of mu was revealed to be caused by the constraint for maximum methanol feeding rate, F(max), and F(max) was constant until mu decreased to mu(min). We tried to realize the optimal mu in the fed-batch fermentation by manipulating the methanol feeding rate and obtained it. However, the observed varrho was differed from the expected one. The discrepancy between the expected varrho and observed varrho after the change of mu suggests the inapplicability of the relationship between mu and varrho to dynamic situations where mu changes. To confirm this, simulation and fed-batch fermentation runs were carried out at a methanol feeding rate that would cause a continuous change in mu. The rHSA production was simulated well, suggesting the applicability of the relationship between mu and varrho in such situations. Discontinuity in the change in methanol feeding rate of the optimal feed pattern at the time mu changed is considered to be the cause for the discrepancy between the expected and observed varrho. Therefore, a new methanol feeding strategy that could mimic the changes in mu and varrho of the optimal strategy without a discontinuity in the feeding rate was sought using a mathematical model of fermentation by trial and error. This modification in the methanol feeding rate resulted in a considerably improved varrho and 18% increase in total rHSA production compared with those obtained by the optimal strategy.",

        "abstract": "Iodine-123-labelled 3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid ([123I]β-CIT) labels both the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and this ligand is able to clarify pathological changes in both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. However, the differential kinetics of β-CIT binding to DAT and 5-HTT has not been clarified fully. In this study we examined time-activity curves of [123I]β-CIT in individual regions in the rat brain. Using cerebellum as the reference region,k3 andk4 values were estimated by a two-compartment kinetic analysis. In the striatum, the kinetics was slowest among all brain areas. In this area specific binding reached its peak 4 h after the injection. In the hypothalamus, specific binding reached its peak 1 h after the injection and its amount did not change until 4 h after the injection. In the occipital cortex, the binding and washout of the ligand were fastest among all brain regions. Estimatedk3 values were 0.040±0.003 in the striatum, 0.019±0.002 in the hypothalamus and 0.082±0.011 in the occipital cortex (min−t, mean ±SD). Estimatedk4 values were 0.0034±0.0005 in the striatum, 0.0071±0.0009 in the hypothalamus and 0.083±0.013 in the occipital cortex (min−1, mean ±SD). Therefore binding kinetics of [123I]β-CIT in the region rich in DAT is apparently different from that in the region rich in 5-HTT. These results will provide fundamental data to image both DAT and 5-HTT in one series of examinations with [123I]β-CIT.",

The mesio-distal position of the lingual foramina was classified into 17 areas of the midline area and each tooth area. The vertical position was assessed from the positional relationship between the lingual foramina and mandibular canals. Additionally, anastomoses of the lingual canals from the lingual foramina to mandibular canals were observed on the images.One hundred and fifty-four lingual foramina were observed. The highest regional frequency was recognized in the midline area followed by second premolar and canine area. Plural lingual foramina were observed only in the midline areas. No lingual foramina were observed in the superior area of the mandibular canals. Thirty-one lingual foramina showed anastomoses between the lingual canals and mandibular canals.Information on the high regional frequency of lingual foramina in the second premolar area would be clinically significant to avoid life-threatening incidents because of the possible presence of an artery. It is therefore important to confirm the location of lingual foramina.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we performed a screening of the specificities of rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms for metabolic reactions known as the specific probes of human CYP isoforms, using 13 rat CYP isoforms expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells or B-lymphoblastoid cells. Among the metabolic reactions studied, diclofenac 4-hydroxylation (DFH), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (DMOD) and midazolam 4-hydroxylation were specifically catalyzed by CYP2C6, CYP2D2 and CYP3A1/3A2, respectively. These results suggest that diclofenac 4-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan O-demethylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation are useful as catalytic markers of CYP2C6, CYP2D2 and CYP3A1/3A2, respectively. On the other hand, phenacetin O-deethylation and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation were catalyzed both by CYP1A2 and by CYP2C6. Benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation and pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylation were also catalyzed by CYP1A2 in addition to CYP2B1. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation was extensively catalyzed by CYP2D2 but also by CYP2C6 and CYP2C11. p-Nitrophenol 2-hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation were extensively catalyzed by CYP2E1 but also by CYP1A2 and CYP3A1. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further study to clarify whether these activities in rat liver microsomes are useful as probes of rat CYP isoforms. In contrast, coumarin 7-hydroxylation and S- and R-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation did not show selectivity toward any isoforms of rat CYP studied. Therefore, activities of coumarin 7-hydroxylation and S- and R-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation are not able to be used as catalytic probes of CYP isoforms in rat liver microsomes. These results may provide useful information regarding catalytic probes of rat CYPs for studies using rat liver microsomal samples.",

        "title": "Development and preliminary application of a high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for omeprazole metabolism in human liver microsomes.",
        "abstract": "A high-performance liquid chromatography assay was developed to measure the enzymatic activities of the 5-hydroxylation and sulphoxidation of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, in human liver microsomes. The preliminary study was also undertaken to assess the assay's applicability for the enzyme kinetic analysis of omeprazole metabolism by human liver microsomes. The recovery of 5-hydroxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulphone and phenacetin (internal standard) after the precipitation of microsomal protein by acetonitrile was nearly complete. The intra-assay relative standard deviations (n = 6) were 8.2 and 12.8% for quantitation of the 5-hydroxylation and sulphoxidation activities of omeprazole, respectively. Eadie-Hofstee plots for the formation of 5-hydroxyomeprazole and omeprazole sulphone gave a biphasic relationship for all the microsomal samples studied (n = 6). The respective mean (+/- SD) high- and low-affinity component kinetic parameters for the 5-hydroxylation and sulphoxidation of omeprazole estimated by a two-enzyme kinetic analysis were: Km1 = 6.3 +/- 1.7 and 10.4 +/- 6.3 microM, Km2 = 183.2 +/- 180.4 and 671.2 +/- 639.4 microM, Vmax1 = 109.8 +/- 75.4 and 77.5 +/- 46.1 pmol mg-1 min-1, and Vmax2 = 163.3 +/- 94.1 and 318.3 +/- 163.3 pmol mg-1 min-1. The results suggest that the assay is reproducible, accurate and applicable for studying the metabolism of omeprazole in human liver microsomes.",

        "abstract": "Mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) often causes serious drug-drug interactions. To examine species differences in MBI of CYP3A between humans and rodents, we compared MBI potencies of five representative CYP3A inhibitors in human, rat and mouse liver microsomes. Among the inhibitors studied, erythromycin and clarithromycin exhibited markedly weaker MBI effects on CYP3A activity in rat and mouse liver microsomes compared to human liver microsomes. Results of spectroscopic experiments showed that erythromycin and clarithromycin form a metabolic intermediate complex with human liver microsomes but not with rat or mouse liver microsomes. In contrast, troleandomycin, diltiazem and nicardipine form a metabolic intermediate complex with rat and mouse liver microsomes, although some differences in MBI potency among species were observed. Parameters for MBI potency (k(inact)/K(I) ratio) and reversible inhibition (IC(50)) were negatively correlated (r=-0.820, p=0.0003), suggesting that the different affinities of CYP3A inhibitor for CYP3A may partly contribute to the different MBI potencies of inhibitor among species. Taken together, the results suggest that there are species differences in MBI of CYP3A in humans, rats and mice, which should be considered when rodents are used as in vivo models for MBI-mediated drug-drug interaction study.",
