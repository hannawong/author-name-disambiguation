        "abstract": "A novel carbon composite electrode has been fabricated using ionic liquid n-octylpyridinum hexafluorophosphate (OPFP) and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). This electrode combined the advantages of ionic liquid and SWCNT as well as the characteristics of the \"bulk\" composite electrodes. Compared with the commercial glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and the ionic liquid-graphite (IL-G) composite electrode, the ionic liquid-SWCNT (IL-SWCNT) composite electrode exhibited remarkable increase in the electron transfer rate for electroactive compound and significant decrease in the overpotential for the oxidation of nitrite. Based on the enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of nitrite, a wide linear range from 1.0 μM to 12.0 mM with a low detection limit of 0.1 μM was obtained. Furthermore, the IL-SWCNT electrode was applied to determine nitrite levels in milk samples. Experimental results showed that the proposed electrode could be used as an effective and sensitive sensor for the determination of nitrite. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Sex chromosomes in dioecious and polygamous plants evolved as a mechanism for ensuring outcrossing to increase genetic variation in the offspring. Sex specificity has evolved in 75% of plant families by male sterile or female sterile mutations, but well-defined heteromorphic sex chromosomes are known in only four plant families. A pivotal event in sex chromosome evolution, suppression of recombination at the sex determination locus and its neighboring regions, might be lacking in most dioecious species. However, once recombination is suppressed around the sex determination region, an incipient Y chromosome starts to differentiate by accumulating deleterious mutations, transposable element insertions, chromosomal rearrangements, and selection for male-specific alleles. Some plant species have recently evolved homomorphic sex chromosomes near the inception of this evolutionary process, while a few other species have sufficiently diverged heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Comparative analysis of carefully selected plant species together with some fish species promises new insights into the origins of sex chromosomes and the selective forces driving their evolution.",

The aim of this study was to explore the rates and risks of PGD, and the association between PGD, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in bereaved Chinese adults. The PG-13, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were administered to 445 subjects. Prevalence within the general population of China was 1.8% (i.e., 8/445). Among the eight subjects who met the PGD diagnosis, 75%, 87.5% and 75% scored above the cut-off point on the PCL-C, SDS and SAS, respectively, although a portion remained free from comorbidity. ANOVA, correlation analysis and stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that kinship to deceased, age of the deceased, religion belief and cause of death were predictive of prolonged grief. A small proportion of bereaved persons may exhibit PGD. There is a substantial but far from complete overlap between PGD and the other three diagnoses. Bereaved parents and the widowed have high risk of PGD. These findings highlight the need for prevention, diagnosis and treatment for PGD patients.",

        "abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-fiber optical mode switching structure supporting independent switching, exchanging, adding, and dropping functionalities in which each mode can be switched individually. The mode switching structure consists of cascaded mode selective couplers (MSCs) capable of exciting and selecting specific higher order modes in few-mode fibers with high efficiency and one multiport optical switch routing the independent spatial modes to their destinations. The data carried on three different spatial modes can be switched, exchanged, added, and dropped through this all-fiber structure. For this experimental demonstration, optical on-off-keying (OOK) signals at                 10        -        Gb        /        s           carried on three spatial modes are successfully processed with open and clear eye diagrams. The mode switch exhibits power penalties of less than 3.1 dB after through operation, less than 2.7 dB after exchange operation, less than 2.8 dB after switching operation, and less than 1.6 dB after mode adding and dropping operations at the bit-error rate (BER) of                          10                     −            3                          , while all three channels carried on three spatial modes are simultaneously routed. The proposed structure, compatible with current optical switching networks based on single-mode fibers, can potentially be used to expand the switching scalability in advanced and flexible short-reach mode-division multiplexing-based networks.",

The main technique of this method is clipping the processed signal whose probability of the peak value has been reduced by PTS technique. Then the PAPR value will be further reduced. It will bring in slight change to the BER performance between with and without clipping. We know that both the ROF and OFDM techniques are key issues of the next generation network. Reduce the PAPR of OFDM is a necessary work. The simulation results show the feasibility of this method.",

Light-trail can inherently support multicast given its bus nature. In this paper, we study how to use the minimum number of light- trails to form a multicast tree for supporting the given multicast session. The problem for general light-trail WDM networks is proved to be NP-hard. Two auxiliary graphs will be proposed to transform the problem into minimum steiner tree problem that many effective algorithms can be applied. We then show that the same problem in light-trail WDM ring networks can be solved in polynomial time. The simulations show the effectiveness of our work.",

        "abstract": "The gold ore deposit in Jiaodong is the product of geological processes on a regional scale. Its formation and evolution are controlled by the mantle shear zone, deep - seated fluids, the maturity of continental lithosphere and deep - faults, and are closely related with the formation and evolution of the Tancheng-Lujiang Fault Zone and plate subduction-collision-jams. The occurrence and formation process of deposits are controlled by the crust-mantle interaction and are interconnected with the formation and evolution of the Tancheng-Lujiang Wrench Fault System. The Tancheng-Lujiang Fault is mature lithosphere fault of deep mantle-cut and a fluids bearing mantle shear zone where the coupling of fluid - heat - chemistry - physics occurred. The shear anatexis of the Tancheng - Lujiang Fault is one of basic forces generating lithogenesis and mineralization, and is one of basic reasons of ore - forming reactivation and migration. Mantle-fluids were changed into alkali metasomatizing solution by crust-mantle interaction. And with ore fluid system being migrated to upper horizon through this solution diverging and migrating along the Tancheng-Lujiang Fault, the source of ore is supplied. The gold ore deposit in Jiaodong is a mantle upwelling area where the gold ore deposits are located at gradient variation and deformation locations of the Moho. The intensity of mineralization in an upward area of a down - warping region is minor. The scale of super-large alkali metasomatism, the intensity of ore fluids and enriched effect of ore-forming elements controls super-large deposits. The authors propose that the transformation of tectonodynamic mechanism gave a dynamic guarantee for the mineralizing materials to react, transport, gather and mineralize, then the transformation of tectonic stress field and the mineralization of gold took place on the space-time interface where shear-strain deformed structural lithofacies transformed to shear -tension deformed structural lithofacies.",

Anharmonic transition frequencies and anharmonicities for the molecules in vacuum are evaluated. Instantaneous normal-mode analysis is performed and the vibrational frequency distribution correlations are examined for the molecules solvated in TIP3P water. Many local and regional motions of the biomolecules are predicted to be anharmonically coupled and their vibrational frequencies are predicted to be largely correlated. These coupled and correlated vibrational motions can be easily visualized by pairwise cross peaks in the femtosecond broadband two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra, which are simulated using time-domain third-order nonlinear response functions. A network of distinctive spectral profiles of the 2D IR cross peaks, including peak orientations and positive and negative signal patterns, are shown to be intimately connected with the couplings and correlations. The results show that the vibrational couplings and correlations, driven by solvent interactions and also by intrinsic vibrational interactions, are vibrational mode dependent and thus chemical group dependent, and form the structural and dynamical basis of the anharmonic vibrators that are ubiquitous in biomolecules.",

Here, we investigated a new sandwich-like neoadjuvant regimen with bevacizumab.This was a single-arm, open-labeled, phase II trial. Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received sandwich-like neoadjuvant therapy with bevacizumab (induction therapy with bevacizumab and FOLFOX, concurrent chemoradiotherapy with bevacizumab and consolidation chemotherapy with FOLFOX). Surgery was performed 4-6 weeks later. The primary endpoint of this study was pathologic complete response.Twenty-five eligible patients were included. All completed the neoadjuvant therapy protocol. During the course of neoadjuvant therapy, 3 patients (12 %) had grade 4 hematological toxicity events and 12 (48 %) had grade 3 non-hematological toxicity events. According to RECIST criteria, 18 patients (72 %) achieved partial response and the rest seven patients (28 %) remained stable disease. Two patients (8 %) refused the subsequent surgical therapy for personal reasons, and 23 patients (92 %) underwent operations finally. Nine (39.1 %, 95 % CI 18.0-57.5 %) of them achieved pathologic complete response. Five of them (21.7 %) had postoperative complications. After a median follow-up period of 25.3 (14.4-40.9) months, four patients developed disease progression and two died of cancer. The 3-year overall survival rate was 95 % (95 % CI 69.5-99.3 %), and the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 72.5 % (95 % CI 33.7-90.9 %).Sandwich-like neoadjuvant therapy with bevacizumab is safe and effective for locally advanced rectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "Truthful resource request from users is the premise to achieve the maximum social welfare in an enterprise private cloud. To stimulate the truthfulness of users, most previous works mainly rely on introducing the payment, which however, might not be applicable in enterprise private clouds, where there is a lack of money transfer. To address this issue, this paper proposes non-payment but efficient mechanisms in private clouds to stimulate the truthfulness of the users and meanwhile maximize the social welfare. Moreover, different from previous works that allow only one job request from one user, this paper studies a more general model, where multiple jobs can be submitted by each user. Specifically, we consider two task models: the migration-admissible model and non-migration model. In the former model, jobs can be executed at different servers, and may undergo migration if necessary. Alternatively, in the latter model, jobs can only be executed at one server without migration. For both models, we design incentive resource allocation mechanisms to maximize the social welfare. Theoretically analysis shows that the proposed mechanisms are truthful for general monotonic profit functions and the worst-case performance on the social welfare are well-bounded within a constant factor of the optimal solution for linear profit functions. Simulation results also demonstrate that the performances of the proposed mechanisms are very close to the optimal solution, in terms of maximizing the social welfare.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIt has been difficult to obtain the fitted bra wire shape for women’s breasts, since the under breast root shape extracted from 3D bodyscan breast images is three dimensional. A detailed matrix algorithm for the geometric relation is firstly introduced and presented for transferring the 3D bra wire shape to one that is 2D to create a fitted bra underwire shape prototype. In this paper, the under breast root shape was extracted from a medium average avatar, then the curve line was exported as a point format. Points were taken as research subject, then the transformation matrix algorithm was applied to the spatial coordinates of the points to fulfill the transformation. Thereby a detailed program was operated in MATLAB for obtaining the coordinates of points to create the contour for the 2D wire shape. The matrix algorithm method was a useful, simple and straightforward method to implement. In addition, it works well for various kinds of breast shapes.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】In order to study the difference of starch quantity among the local germplasm resources, the starch pasting characteristics of local germplasm resources for glutinous rice were evaluated and then indentified, which can lay a foundation for selecting special and valuable germplasm and promoting the proceeding of glutinous rice breeding and production. 【Method】A total of 97 glutinous rice cultivars collected in the 1950 s in the Taihu Lake area were employed in this study. The characteristic values of RVA profiles were investigated to access the gelatinization characteristics of these cultivars. 【Result】 The results showed that: there was a very significant diversity among germplasm types, where the range of the breakdown value was as high as 4 798 cp, while that of the peak viscosity, the final viscosity and the setback viscosity were around 3 000 cp. There were also high differences in terms of the peak time and the gelatinization temperature. The results indicated that the RVA profile have fairly high diversity with the Shannon index 1.86. The RVA profile of these cultivars fell into four categories: the category of general characteristics that account for 92.7% of the total cultivars, the peak viscosity of which ranged from 1 000 to 2 700 cp; the specific category such as the varieties of Liyangnuo, Zhuxiangnuo, Baikehuolanhuang, and Jinggunuo, the peak viscosity of which was over 3 000 cp and with comparatively high breakdown value and setback value; the category such as Huangjingnuo, Maonuo and Putaonuo with fairly low peak viscosity, which ranged from 500 cp to 800 cp; the category such as Bainuodao from Wuxian and Duizinuo from Wujing with positive setback values which were 461 cp and 1 849 cp, respectively. But these cultivars of the specificcategories did not show any difference in plant shape. 【Conclusion】There was a significant variation in the RVA profiles of Taihu Glutinous rice cultivars including three specific categories, i.e. two with extremely high and low peak viscosity respectively and one with characters of indica rice, which therefore indicates that RVA profile have fairly high diversity.",

Results indicate that, either sampling performance or sampling efficiency, MCMC method both has its special advantages in producing posterior distribution.

The effective magnetic anisotropy including shape anisotropy and strain anisotropy has been determined from the magnetizing curves of these granular solid samples using the law of approach to saturation. The obtained values of the effective magnetic anisotropy exceed 106 erg cm-3. The almost temperature-independent effective magnetic anisotropy can approximately explain the variation of Hc versus T for the granular solid samples. The shape anisotropy has been estimated assuming that the average axis ratio of the metal particles c/a is 1.2 and the strain anisotropy has been calculated from the effective anisotropy and the shape anisotropy. The magnitude of the strain anisotropy and the variation of the strain anisotropy with temperature are explained for the Fe-SiO2 and Fe20Ni80-SiO2 granular solid samples.",

        "abstract": "In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), it is important to understand the throughput-delay trade-off (TD trade-off) problem in large-scale scenarios. In the literature, the TD tradeoff problem has been studied extensively and many of them are based on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) mobility model, in which each node can randomly move to any place in the network, after every time slot. Although the i.i.d. model has been widely used, it cannot fully represent MANETs in which nodes change positions less frequently. To characterize such MANETs, in this paper, we propose a generalized i.i.d. (g.i.i.d.) mobility model, in which each node moves once after every 1/f (0 <; f ≤ 1) time slots, and remains static between two moves. To investigate the TD trade-off under the g.i.i.d. model, we develop a novel multi-relay multi-hop (MRMH) scheme that exploits the opportunities of multi-hop transmissions when the network is static. Furthermore, to enable the multi-hop transmissions, we construct a new percolation highway system, which has not been used in the TD trade-off analysis for MANETs. Using the proposed MRMH scheme, we develop and prove constructive bounds for throughput and delay in MANETs with different scales of f. Our constructive bound is asymptotically optimal for f = 1 (i.e., the i.i.d. model).",

        "abstract": "Internet traffic is doubling almost every other year which implies that datacenter (DC) scalability will play a critical role in enabling future communications. In this paper, we propose FISSION (Flexible Interconnection of Scalable Systems Integrated using Optical Networks)-a scalable, fault-tolerant DC architecture based on a switchless optical-bus backplane and carrier-class switches, and its supporting protocol. The FISSION DC enables unprecedented scalability using affordable optics and standardized electrical switches. It is architecturally bifurcated into sectors that internally have a nonblocking carrier-class switching interconnection structure. Sectors are connected in the switchless backplane using optical buses. Each sector can receive traffic on all wavelengths (achieved through optical-bus property without any switch reconfiguration) and across all fibers, but a sector transmits on only a group of wavelengths and only in one of the fiber rings in the backplane. The switches function based on an SDN methodology that facilitate mapping of complex protocols and addresses to DC-specific addressing that is scalable and easier to use. We present an analysis to optimize the FISSION architecture. A simulation model is proposed that (1) compares the FISSION approach to other contemporary designs; (2) provides scalability analysis and protocol performance measurement; and, (3) provides optical layer modeling to validate working of the FISSION framework at high line-rates. Our architecture, which provides 100% bisection bandwidth, is validated by simulation results exhibiting negligible packet loss and low end-to-end latency.",

        "abstract": "Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) provide new opportunities for exploring oceans and consequently improving our understanding of the underwater world. UASNs usually rely on hardware infrastructure with poor flexibility and versatility. Compared with wireless sensor networks, UASNs are quite expensive to manufacture and deploy. Due to the unique data format, protocols, and service constraints of various applications, UASNs are typically deployed in a redundant manner, which not only leads to waste but also causes serious interference due to the presence of multiple signals in the same underwater region. Software-defined networking (SDN) provides an innovative means of improving the flexibility of underwater systems. In this paper, we present an SDN-based UASN framework, followed by the design of a clustering method in which learning automata and degree-constrained connected dominating sets are employed. We then propose a load balancing mechanism involving multiple controllers, based on the consistent hashing algorithm. Finally, we describe a simulation program (called UASNs hypervisor) that we developed and implemented to assess the network survival time, bit-error rate, and computational complexity. The experimental results show that the UASN was improved significantly. This work provides important theoretical and technical support for the implementation of SDN-based UASNs.",

The objectives of our optimal LNC design include (1) satisfying the ITS requirement, (2) maximizing the transmission rate of a unicast stream, and (3) minimizing the number of additional random symbols. We first formulate the problem that maximizes the secure transmission rate under the requirement of ITS, which is then transformed to a constrained maximum network flow problem.We devise an efficient algorithm that can find the optimal transmission topology. Based on the transmission topology, we then design a deterministic LNC which satisfies the aforementioned objectives and provide a constructive upper bound of the size of the finite field. In addition, we also study the potential of random LNC and derive the low bound of the probability that a random LNC is information theoretically secure.",

The performance of DCO-OFDM VLC system is analyzed and discussed with different techniques of LED nonlinearity alleviation. The simulation results show that compared to the original DCO-OFDM VLC system, the system with the proposed scheme can achieve about 4.8 dB improvement of PAPR reduction and 7 dB improvement of bit error rate (BER) performance. The reason is that the signals acquiring the desired shape in LED linear region can be recovered correctly without distortion induced by LED nonlinearity. It is demonstrated that the proposed SLM-RC technique effectively reduces not only PAPR but also the impacts of LED nonlinearity without BER deterioration.",

        "abstract": "In service computing, it is often desirable to find the service composition solution for a given service composition request such that the total cost of the service composition solution is minimized. In this paper, we study the problem of finding the minimum cost service composition (MCSC) for a general service composition request which is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We first prove that the general case of the MCSC problem is NP-Hard. We then show that optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time for some special structured service composition requests. To this end, we derive a sufficient condition on the service composition request graph and propose corresponding algorithms to find the optimal solutions in polynomial time. Using such algorithms as building blocks, we propose heuristic algorithms to decompose the general service composition request graph into service composition request subgraphs with optimal structures. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of adding virginiamycin to diets of steers on ruminal microbial populations. Four ruminally cannulated steers (559.4 ±30.1 kg) were utilized in a repeat crossover design. Treatment group added virginiamycin. Ruminal fluid was collected on 28 d of experimental period,starting at 8:00 prefeeding and at 12:00 and 16:00 post-feeding from the anterior,dorsal,and mid-ventral region of the rumen. The Amount of microbial was counted after culturing using roll-tube technique. We detected that adding virginiamycin to diets of steers could active suppression and regulate amylolytic bacteria populations and proteolytic bacteria populations (P<0.01). But the populations of cellulolytic bacteria,total viable bacteria and protozoon were no difference between control group and treatment group. Statistics result of virginiamycin regulated that the different sampling time showed:viginiamycin could inhibite and regulate amylolytic bacteria populations when the sampling time was at 8:00 (P<0.05). Viginiamycin could inhibite and regulate amylolytic bacteria populations and proteolytic bacteria populations when the sampling time was at 12:00(P<0.05). But the populations of cellulolytic bacteria,total viable bacteria and protozoon were no difference between control group and treatment group at the different sampling time. But the populations of total viable bacteria and protozoon to showed a tendency that \"high-low-high\" with time changed between control group and treatment group. The results showed that virginiamycin could active suppression and regulate amylolytic bacteria populations and proteolytic bacteria populations on high concentration. Therefore,virginiamycin potentially could prevent ruminal acidosis.",

        "abstract": "Located in the northern part of the Da Hinggan Mountain metallogenic belt,the Jiawula deposit is a large Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic ore deposit which was discovered in recent years.Ore body is totally controlled by fault structure and the main metallic minerals are galena,sphalerite,chalcopyrite,pyrite,pyrrhotite,arsenopyrite,molybdenite,magnetite,etc.In this paper,the author analyzed geochemistry of sulfur,hydrogen,oxygen,carbon and lead isotopes of the deposit.The study indicated that the δ34S(‰) values range from 1.37 to 4.10‰ with an average of 3.10‰(n=13);that the δ18Owater(‰) values range from—18.96 to +1.08‰(n=9) with an average of—11.36‰;that the δDV-SMOW(‰) values range from—133.6 to—103.4‰(n=9);that the 206Pb/204Pb,207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb values of 27 samples range 18.228 3—18.758 7,15.457—15.880 and 37.841—39.049,respectively,and the lead isotope compositions showed that all the lead belong to normal radiogenic lead;that the δ13CV-PDB(‰) values range from—5.2 to—8.4‰ with an average of—6.8‰(n=2).The sulfur and carbon isotope data suggested that the ore forming fluids were mainly derived from the deep magmatic fluids and the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions indicated that the ore forming fluids were composed of magmatic fluids in the early stage and of meteoric water in the late stage.The lead isotopic compositions confirmed that the origin of lead in the deposit was mainly from mantle source as well as little from crust source.All the isotopic compositions demonstrated that the formation of the Jiawula large Pb-Zn-Ag deposit was associated with the volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal activities in the late Yanshanian period and the addition of meteoric water within the magmatic fluids created a favorable condition for the metallogenic elements to accumulate and precipitate to form such a large deposit.The occurrence of mineralization was under a low δ34S∑S,medium oxidation state,relatively open and non-equilibrium system.Geodynamic settings of the mineralization were under a process of huge lithosphere thinning.The genetic type of the Jiawula deposit can be regarded as the volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal vein Pb-Zn-Ag ore deposit.",

The incidence of large volume (diameter > or = 8 cm), serosal invasion (T(4)) and late TNM stage (IV stage) were significantly higher in the UO group than that in the PG group. There was no difference in peritoneal dissemination, distant lymph node and hepatic metastasis, and tumor location between the two groups. The one- and two-year survival of the patients in the PG group was 48.1% and 23.1%, and significantly better than 13.5% and 0 in the UO group.Palliative gastrectomy, compared with unresectable operation, can improve the prognosis of the patients with late-staged gastric cancer even with peritoneal dissemination, distant lymph node and hepatic metastasis, and surrounding organ invasion.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the wide adoption of the RFID technology in many important application domains including logistics, inventory, retailing, public transportation, and security. Though RFID tags (transponders) can be passive, the high power consumption of RFID readers (interrogators) has become a critical issue as handheld and mobile readers are increasingly available in pervasive computing environments. Moreover, high transmission power aggravates interference, complicating the deployment and operation of RFID systems. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient RFID inventory algorithm called Automatic Power Stepping (APS). The design of APS is based on extensive empirical study on passive tags, and takes into consideration several important details such as tag response states and variable slot lengths. APS dynamically estimates the number of tags to be read, incrementally adjusts power level to use sufficient but not excessive power for communication, and consequently reduces both the energy consumption for reading a set of tags and the possibility of collisions. We design APS to be compatible with the current Class-1 Generation-2 RFID standards and hence a reader running APS can interact with existing commercial tags without modification. We have implemented APS both on the NI RFID testing platform and in a high-fidelity simulator. The evaluation shows that APS can save more than 60% energy used by RFID readers.",

The gastric cancer patient died of recurrence 5 months after operation. The rectal cancer patient with pulmonary tuberculosis died of hepatic function failure 7 months after operation without recurrence.

        "abstract": "To protect user privacy, many smartphone systems, such as Android and Windows Phone, adopt the permission-based mechanism in which a user can evaluate the request of private information by a mobile app before installing it. However, recent studies show that the permission-based mechanism is vulnerable to application colluding attacks because two apps, which appear to be harmless individually, can establish a covert channel and use it to leak confidential information. In general, existing known covert channels usually work in a way that one app can modify the status of a system component, while the other can read the status. Even though several covert channel detection schemes have been proposed recently to fight against this type of covert channels, we point out that such designed covert channel detection schemes are not sufficient. In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of establishing novel covert channels that work in quite different ways, in which one app (e.g., a game) can be designed deliberately such that the user will be induced to voluntarily modify the status of a system component (e.g., a motion sensor), while the other app can read the status of the system component. To validate our design, we implement three covert channels on Android. Our experiments show that these channels can bypass existing detection schemes. Moreover, we also measure the achievable throughput, error rate, and energy consumption in devices. The results demonstrate that our covert channels can achieve a transmission with high accuracy and low energy consumption. Our work sets a new alarm for the security issue of using smartphones.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various civilian applications, most of which only require a single UAV. In the near future, it is expected that more and more applications will be enabled by the cooperation of multiple UAVs. To facilitate such applications, it is desirable to utilize a general control platform for cooperative UAVs. However, existing open-source control platforms cannot fulfill such a demand because (1) they only support the leader-follower mode, which limits the design options for fleet control, (2) existing platforms can support only certain UAVs and thus lack of compatibility, and (3) these platforms cannot accurately simulate a flight mission, which may cause a big gap between simulation and real flight. To address these issues, we propose a general control and monitoring platform for cooperative UAV fleet, namely, CoUAV, which provides a set of core cooperation services of UAVs, including synchronization, connectivity management, path planning, energy simulation, etc. To verify the applicability of CoUAV, we design and develop a prototype and we use the new system to perform an emergency search application that aims to complete a task with the minimum flying time. To achieve this goal, we design and implement a path planning service that takes both the UAV network connectivity and coverage into consideration so as to maximize the efficiency of a fleet. Experimental results by both simulation and field test demonstrate that the proposed system is viable.",

        "title": "Energy-Efficient Transmission With Data Sharing in Participatory Sensing Systems.",
        "abstract": "In a participatory sensing system, data sensed from smartphone users are shared with the general public who requests data through submitting tasks. When multiple tasks request the data from a mobile user, the mobile user can make a transmission schedule to achieve the balance between the amount of data transmitted and energy consumption. Intuitively, reducing the amount of data transmitted by making use of data sharing between the tasks can save the energy consumption. However, due to the convexity of rate-power function for rate-adaptive transmitting devices, a schedule purely minimizing the amount of data transmitted may not always be the optimal one minimizing the energy consumption. Thus, there exists a tradeoff between the amount of data transmitted and energy consumption. This paper formulates the problem as a bi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the amount of data transmitted and the energy consumption. Two task models are studied, first-in-first-out (FIFO) task model and arbitrary deadline (AD) task model, respectively. We first provide optimal algorithms for the off-line case. We then study the online case where requests arrive dynamically without prior information. For FIFO tasks, we develop an online algorithm that is $O(\\\\ln L)$ -competitive with respect to both the amount of data transmitted and energy consumption, where $L$ is the longest length of the time duration of the tasks. For AD tasks, we devise an online algorithm that is $O(\\\\ln ^{2} L)$ -competitive with respect to both the amount of data transmitted and energy consumption. Our simulation results validate the efficiency of our online algorithms.",

In our study, we mean to establish micro integral membrane protein -knockout Lactobacillus plantarum (LPKM) to investigate the change of its protective effects and verify the role of micro integral membrane protein on protection of normal intestinal barrier function.Binding assay and intestinal permeability were performed to verify the protective effects of micro integral membrane protein on intestinal permeability in vitro and in vivo. Molecular mechanism was also determined as the zonulin pathway. Clinical data were also collected for further verification of relationship between zonulin level and postoperative septicemia.LPKM got decreased inhibition of EPEC adhesion to NCM460 cells. LPKM had lower ability to alleviate the decrease of intestinal permeability induced by enteropathogenic-e.coli, and prevent enteropathogenic-e.coli -induced increase of zonulin expression. Overexpression of zonulin lowered the intestinal permeability regulated by Lactobacillus plantarum. There was a positive correlation between zonulin level and postoperative septicemia. Therefore, micro integral membrane protein could be necessary for the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum on intestinal barrier.MIMP might be a positive factor for Lactobacillus plantarum to protect the intestinal epithelial cells from injury, which could be related to the zonulin pathway.",

Then a distributed noncooperative power control algorithm based on differential game is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm achieves the distributed dynamic power control under the condition that the requirements, including the average power threshold and QoS of secondary users, are guaranteed. Furthermore, an analytical solution to feedback Nash equilibrium is obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can regulate the transmitted power of secondary users effectively to enhance the total throughput, and the performance of CR system is thereby improved.",

        "abstract": "It is envisioned that many different types of applications, each requesting a different set of network functions with different quality of service requirements, will run on 5G networks. To accommodate such requests, network slicing, which dynamically creates virtual networks for different types of applications, is proposed in the literature and IETF. A critical issue for the success of network slicing is to determine the amount of resources for a slice to ensure the required quality of service, i.e., the relationship among traffic demand, resource, and delay. This paper aims to tackle this problem. We first study the delay bound for a given traffic distribution and amount of resources using Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC). Then we propose a solution to derive the amount of resources that should be allocated to meet a given delay bound for a given traffic distribution. Extensive simulations show that given the derived amount of resources, the experienced end-to-end delay is less than the given delay bound. However, if only 90% of the derived amount of resources is given, the experienced end-to-end delay is much higher than the allowed delay bound. This demonstrates that the derived amount of resources is close to the minimum amount of resources for ensuring quality of service. The work provides a useful tool for network slice tenants to decide the amount of resources to request from physical network providers.",

Sox2 or Oct4A positive expression was significantly associated with an aggressive phenotype. Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that Sox2 or Oct4A was an independent prognostic factor for HCC. When using subgroup analysis, the patients with a co-expression of Sox2/Oct4A had the poorest prognosis. Further analysis demonstrated that Sox2 alone or Sox2/Oct4A could stratify outcome in HCC patients with early stage.Sox2 and Oct4A can be novel predictors of poor prognosis for patients undergoing resection of HCC.",

        "abstract": "The barite deposits in which Ba presents as BaSO_4 are widespread in the world,whereas the witherite deposits in the presence of BaCO_3 are rarely reported.Numerous layered witherite and barite deposits occur within the Early Paleozoic silicate formations of southern Qinling Mountains.These two types of deposits,representing a large-scale particular metallogenic belt in the world,exhibit paragenetic and separated distribution characteristics.This paper focuses on the fluid inclusion features of witherite,barytocalcite,barite,and quartz in the barium metallogenic belt.The results indicate that the homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions of each mineral ranges from 90 to 310℃,mainly concentrating at the range of 120-220℃.For all that,the peak of forming temperature of witherite and barytocalcite is higher than that of barite about 40℃,and quartz forming temperature distributes more homogeneously,and does not appear peak.The salinity of fluid inclusions of most minerals ranges from 1 to 15 wt%NaCl_(eqv),but the salinity of fluid inclusions of witherite,bary-tocalcite, and quartz generally is more than 5 wt%NaCl_(eqv),while for a considerable proportion of barite,the salinity of fluid inclusions is less than 5 wt%NaCl_(eqv).The fluid inclusions of the barite mainly are of NaCl-H_2O type,whereas the fluid inclusions of witherite are rich in aqueous solution with complicated components like N_2-CO_2-H_2S-CH_4 etc.,which shows that there is a large difference between the metallogenic environments of witherite and barite.Based on these evidences,we suggest that the thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR)of the solution was the main formation mechanism of witherite deposits.",

        "abstract": "The Jiawula Ag-polymetallic deposit in the northern Ag-polymetallic ore concentration area in China belongs to the Manchuria-Xiqi Ag-polymetallic metallogenic belt in Da Hinggan Mountain. Studies of fluids evolution and metallogenic mechanism of the ore deposit are carried out in the paper. Microthermometric study of the fluid inclusions indicates that homogenization temperature ranges from 180 °C to 260 °C. Salinities, densities,pressure and depth of ore forming fluids of the deposit are 0. 18% ∼12. 62% NaCl eqv, 0. 637 g/cm3∼0. 976 g/cm3,0. 344 MPa16. 205 MPa and 0. 5 km-1.5 km,respectively. Test results of the laser Raman study show that the ore forming fluids belong to the H2O-NaCl system. All data demonstrate that the ore forming fluids of the Jiawula deposit are characterized by medium-low temperature,medium-low pressure, medium-low salinity,low density fluids. The composition of the fluids can be divided into two end members:one member is possibly dominated by magmatic fluids while the other is by meteoric water. With high content of metallogenic elements, the magmatic fluids mixed with the rebuiltmeteoric fluids. Fluid mixing is the key factors controlling the accumulation and precipitation of metallogenic elements and the formation of ore deposit.",

        "abstract": "To facilitate mobile cloud computing, a cloud service provider must dynamically create and terminate a large number of virtual machines (VMs), causing fragmented resources that cannot be further utilized. To solve this problem proactively, most of the existing studies have been based on server consolidation, with the main objective of minimizing the number of active servers. Although this approach can minimize resource fragmentation at a particular time, it may be over aggressive at the price of too frequent VM migration and low system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel provident resource defragmentation framework that is revenue-oriented with the goal to reduce unnecessary VM migration. Within the proposed framework, we formulate an optimization problem for resource defragmentation at a particular time epoch, with the consideration of the future impact of any VM migration. We then develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that can obtain near-optimal results. Extensive numerical results confirm that our framework can provide the highest profit and can significantly reduce the VM migration cost in practical scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This experiment examined the egg quality of hens fed vanadium (V) and vitamin C (VC) during storage, as well as the V and VC withdrawal on egg quality and V residual in egg. A total of 360 laying hens (31 weeks old) were randomly allotted into a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement treatments (6 replicates and 10 chicks per replicate) with three levels of dietary V (0, 5, and 10 mg/kg) and two levels of VC (0 and 100 mg/kg) for 19 weeks (feeding V and VC 12 weeks, recovery 7 weeks). The V residual in eggs at 4, 8, and 12th weeks were increased (linear effect, P ≤ 0.01) as V levels increased and was not detected in albumen at 7th week after V withdrawal. Followed by 12-week feeding period, albumen height and Haugh unit of eggs during 2-week storage were decreased (linear and quadratic effect, P u003c 0.01) by dietary V supplementation. Lightness value was increased (linear effect, P u003c 0.01), whereas redness and yellowness value of the eggshell were lowered (linear effect, P u003c 0.01) in V-containing diet. During 7-week withdrawal period, eggs from groups pre-feeding 5 and 10 mg/kg V had lower (linear effect, P u003c 0.01) overall albumen height and Haugh unit. The reducing effect on albumen height and HU continued to be observed until the seventh week, whereas the bleaching effect on eggshell color disappeared after 1-week withdrawal. The results indicated that feeding 5 or 10 mg/kg V increases egg V residual and reduces egg albumen quality and bleached the shell color, and the impaired albumen quality induced by 10 mg/kg of V lasted at least 6 weeks after changing to no V supplementation diet. The addition of VC did not show to affect egg quality during storage or recovery phase.",

        "abstract": "Snail and Twist, transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin as well as inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, play pivotal roles in tumor invasion and metastasis. We investigated the expression of Snail, Twist, and E-cadherin by immunohistochemistry in 193 colorectal cancers, including 79 with positive lymph nodes, 36 with tumor deposits, 39 with both, and 39 with no metastases. Snail was expressed to a greater extent in the group with positive lymph nodes (68.4%), whereas Twist was overexpressed in patients with other metastases (75.0%). Ectopic expression of Snail and Twist correlated with reduced membranous expression of E-cadherin. Importantly, Snail overexpression correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis (P < .0001), whereas Twist up-regulation correlated strongly with other metastases (P < .0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Snail was an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis (odds ratio, 4.445; 95% confidence interval, 2.250-8.781; P < .0001), whereas Twist displayed predictive value for metastasis formation (odds ratio, 5.606; 95% confidence interval, 2.829-11.111; P < .0001), suggesting that lymph node and other metastases may follow different signaling pathways. In conclusion, ectopic expression of Snail and Twist contributed to lymph node and disseminated metastasis, respectively, by reducing E-cadherin expression, providing a novel role for Snail and Twist in the progression of colorectal cancer.",

        "title": "S-Pb isotopic geochemistry, U-Pb and Re-Os geochronology of the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit, Inner Mongolia, NE China",
        "abstract": "The Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit is located in the eastern section of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) and in the southern segment of the Great Hinggan Range polymetallic belt. This deposit is the largest tin-based polymetallic ore deposit in the northern part of the North China plate. The Fe-Sn mineralization principally occurs in skarn zones, which formed in the contact areas between granite intrusions and marbles. Twenty-one ��34SV-PDB values for sulfides from the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit range from -2.3 to +2.7��, with an average of +0.38��, and these values are interpreted to reflect a deep magmatic source of the sulfur contained within the ore minerals of the deposit. The distribution of lead isotopic compositions from sulfides in the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit exhibits a generally concentrated field, indicating that those sulfides have homogeneous lead isotopes and may derive from the same metallic source. The existence of such identical Pb isotopic compositions of sulfides and host granites suggests that granitic magmatism was probably largely responsible for the Huanggangliang mineralization. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating from the Huanggangliang granite exhibits a tight cluster on the Concordia plot and yields a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 139.96��0.87Ma, which is considered to be the best estimate of the crystallization age of the Huanggangliang granite. Results obtained from the molybdenite Re-Os isotopic analysis indicate Re-Os model ages of 133.6 to 141.5Ma and a weighted mean age of 135.1��2.3Ma. The molybdenite Re-Os dating yields an isochron age of 134.9��5.2Ma and an initial 187Os/188Os ratio of -0.22��0.35. The molybdenite Re-Os isochron age is largely consistent with the zircon U-Pb age, indicating that both granite intrusion and Fe-Sn mineralization were associated with the Mesozoic magmatism in NE China. Based on ore deposit geology, isotope geochemistry and geochronology of the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit and regional geodynamic evolution, the formation of this deposit is believed to be related to lithospheric thinning, which was caused by delamination and subsequent upwelling of the asthenosphere under the intra-continental extension in NE China. The dynamic setting for the geological processes should be linked to the NNW subduction of the Izanagi plate beneath the Eurasian plate during the Mesozoic. This subduction triggered intensive magmatism and mineralization events in the Great Hinggan Range of NE China, making this district an important Cu-Mo-Sn-Fe-Ag-Pb-Zn metallogenic province. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Our experiment was based on that the R-SH in degradation product could cause a deoxidization peak at gold working electrode. The response was optimized with respect to accumulation time, ionic strength, drug concentration, reproducibility and other variables. We found that the degradation product of CEP in Na2HPO 4-NaH2PO4 buffer could cause a sensitive deoxidization peak at -0.68V. A linear dependence of peak currents on the concentration was observed in the range of 10-7 - 10-6 mol/L, with a detection limit of 0.5*10-7mol/L.

Objective: To investigate the feasibility for repairing the articular cartilage defect by co-culture of allogenic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and allogenic chondrocytes mixed with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid. Methods: Fifteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups, including experimental group, control group and blank group, and the articular cartilage defect models were prepared. The articular cartilage defect was filled with allogenic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and the complex of allogenic chondrocytes and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and the complex of autologous chondrocytes and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, and the poly lactic-co-glycolic acid copolymer material. Results and Conclusion: Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome staining at 12 weeks after operation showed that the chondrocytes could be seen in the articular cartilage defect of the experimental group with round or polygonal-shaped and in a columnar arrangement. The typical cartilage lacunae were formed and a large number of extracellular matrix depositions could be seen and the repaired tissue showed a hyaline cartilage-like and integrated well with the surrounding tissues and closed well with underlying bone. There was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group; in the blank group, the fiber-like cells could be seen in the articular cartilage defect. It is feasible to repair articular cartilage defect by co-culture of allogenic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and allogenic chondrocytes mixed with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid.",

        "abstract": "According to data broadcast, we can satisfy multiple requests for the same data item in a broadcast tick. However, there is no significant breakthrough in performance improvement until recently that some studies proposed to use network coding in data broadcast. After broadcasting an encoded packet which encodes a number of data items, multiple clients can retrieve different requested data items in a broadcast tick. This not only utilizes bandwidth more efficiently, but also improves system performance. In this work, we propose a generalized encoding framework to incorporate network coding into data scheduling algorithms for on-demand broadcast. In the framework, data scheduling can be formulated as a weighted maximum clique problem in a graph where the weight of the clique is defined according to the performance objectives of the applications. Under the proposed framework, existing data scheduling algorithms for on-demand broadcast can be migrated into their corresponding coding versions while preserving their original criteria in scheduling data items. Our simulation results using a number of representative scheduling algorithms show that significant performance improvement can be achieved with coding. © 2006 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the development of adenoma, the major precursor lesion of colorectal cancer (CRC), would provide a basis for early detection, prevention as well as treatment of CRC. Using the highly sensitive 2-D DIGE method coupled with MS, we identified 24 differentially expressed proteins in adenoma tissues compared with matched normal colonic mucosa and CRC tissues. Fifteen proteins were downregulated and three proteins were upregulated in adenoma tissues when compared with individual-matched normal colonic mucosa. Five proteins were downregulated, while one protein was upregulated in adenoma tissues when compared with matched CRC tissues. A protein, β-tropomyosin (TM-β), recently suggested to be a biomarker of esophageal squamous carcinoma, was downregulated in both adenoma and CRC tissues. Additionally, the reduction in the level of TM-β in adenoma and CRC tissues was further validated by Western blotting (p<0.05) and RT-PCR (p<0.001). Our findings suggest that downregulation of TM-β is involved in the early development of CRC and that differentially expressed proteins might serve as potential biomarkers for detection of CRC.",

The rights of taxpayers are based on the fact that taxpayers transfer the ownership of their own legal property and should be enjoyed by taxpayers in the process of tax payment. They are classified as 14 types, including participation in tax legislation, fair and reasonable tax burden, tax payment by laws and so on. In fact, they are the extension of the basic civil rights, and the property rights are at the core of the extension of the whole rights of taxpayers. It is necessary to attach great importance to the protection of taxpayers' rights during the contemporary economic and social development. Therefore, in China, it is required to construct a theoretical frame for the protection of taxpayers' rights that integrates legislation protection, administrative protection, judicial safeguard, social protection and self-protecting on the basis of the research concerning the natural rights, legal rights and practical rights for taxpayers.",

        "abstract": "There has been an increased effort to understand the nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in non-Western cultures. In particular, growing research has examined OCD in China, but there are no comprehensive instruments that measure both OCD severity and heterogeneity for characterizing samples.A validated, comprehensive measure that could be used in China would provide researchers with a useful instrument for evaluating severity and heterogeneity of OCD in a non-Western culture, allowing researchers to better understand the universal and cultural components that play a role in the nature of OCD.The current investigation presents data on the reliability and validity of a Mandarin translation of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (CH-OCI) using both a student (n = 1950) and clinical sample (n = 50 patients with OCD; n = 50 patients with anxiety as a comparison group).Results support the factor structure, convergent and discriminant validity, criterion-related validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of the CH-OCI.Validation of the instrument permits researchers and clinicians to measure OCD presentation in Mandarin-speaking samples.",

        "abstract": "Many wireless sensor networks require sufficient sensing coverage over long periods of time. To conserve energy, a coverage maintenance protocol achieves desired coverage by activating only a subset of nodes, while allowing the others to sleep. Existing coverage maintenance protocols are often designed based on simplistic sensing models that do not capture the stochastic nature of distributed sensing. We propose a new sensing coverage model based on the distributed detection theory, which captures two important characteristics of sensor networks, i.e., probabilistic detection by individual sensors and data fusion among sensors. We then present three coverage maintenance protocols that can meet the specified event detection probability and false alarm rate. The centralized protocol only activates a small number of sensors, but introduces extremely long coverage configuration delay. The Se-Grid protocol reduces the configuration time by dividing the network into separate fusion groups, but increases the number of active sensors due to the lack of collaboration among sensors in different groups. In contrast, by coordinating overlapping fusion groups, the Co-Grid protocol can effectively reduce the number of active sensors and the coverage configuration time. The advantages of Co-Grid have been validated through simulations and benchmark results on Mica2 motes.",

        "abstract": "Light-trail is proposed as a candidate to carry IP traffic over wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks given its capability of accommodating multi-granularity traffic by time-division multiplexing (TDM). Light-trail's unidirectional shared-media multicast nature makes it hard to implement distributed access control and restricts that at most one packet transmission can take place at any time. Recently, opportunistic optical hyperchannel was proposed to improve light-trail by permitting easy distributed access control. In this paper, we propose a set of distributed access control protocols, namely, 1-persistent protocols, for opportunistic optical hyperchannels to maximize the throughput and provide fair service among contending nodes by taking their inherent advantage of adaptive space-division multiplexing (SDM).

In order to determine the diagenetic age of the deposit,LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age study was conducted on the zircons in the gabbro and diorite associated with the mineralization.The results suggest that the gabbro and diorite were crystallized in 133.19 Ma and 130.48 Ma, respectively. The gabbro and diorite are enriched in LILE, LREE and depleted in HFSE, which indicate that the magma were derived from lithospheric mantle and formed in extensional tectonic setting. Combined with the geological characteristics and the previous research in this region, the Yanshanian is considered to be a peak period of mineralization and magmatism of the southern Daxing'anling. The tectonic setting of the intrusive rocks was in the transition period from lithosphere compression to extension.",

        "abstract": "Background  Tissue factor (TF) is emphasized as the promising target in the future targeted therapy strategy for colorectal cancer (CRC).\n Recent evidence showed that TF expression is under the control of K-ras and p53. However, a comprehensive evaluation of TF expression, K-ras status, and p53 mutation has not been systematically analyzed. The aims of this study were to identify the percentages of positive TF in\n CRC patients; analyze the associations of TF expression, K-ras status, and p53 mutation; and evaluate the prognostic value of TF in CRC patients.\n \n \n \n \n Methods  Ninety-six CRC samples were tested for TF expression, p53 mutation, and K-ras status by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis, direct sequencing, and real-time quantitative\n PCR. Associations were sought with TF expression and clinical outcomes.\n \n \n \n \n Results  TF expression was related to clinical stages, tumor differentiation, and tumor size. The positive proportions of TF expression\n on tumor cells and tumor vascular endothelial cells were 70% and 53% respectively in CRC patients. The positive proportion\n of TF co-expression on both cancer cells and tumor vascular endothelial cells was 40%, compared to an 83% total TF positive\n proportion in CRC patients. TF expression on CRC appeared to be increased with K-ras and/or p53 mutation(s). Disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly reduced in CRC patients with high TF expression.\n \n \n \n \n Conclusions  TF may participate in both K-ras and p53 mutations involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and could be considered as a prognostic indicator for patients CRC.",

The basic volcanic rocks' Na_2O(3.84%～4.30%)>K_2O(2.49%～3.80%)and Na_2O+K_2O=6.44%～7.92%.Feldspar phenocryst of it consists of oligoclase(An=11～25).The acidic volcanie rocks' Na_2O(3.64%～5.31%)>K_2O(1.19%～2.75%)and Na_2O+K_2O=6.28%～7.68%.Both feldspar phenocryst and microlite consist of albites(An=0～1.1).(3)Only meta-basic volcanic rock occurred in Hougeqi.Its Na_2O (1.36%～3.78%)>K_2O(0.30%～2.16%)and Na_2O+K_2O=2.03%～4.09%;(4)Distribution patterns of Ree and trace elements of the volcanic rocks of Tanyaokou,Dongshengmiao and Hougeqi deposits are both similarity and marked difference;(5)Sm- Nd isotopic model ages of basic volcanic rocks of these deposits are:1857～1877Ma and 2006～2132Ma in Tanyaokou,1740～1867Ma in Dongshengmiao and in Hougeqi;(6)Some tuffs and volcanic blocks and debris occurred in the host succession or in pyrite ore.These facts mentioned above,together with the lead isotopic model ages of all deposits in this aulacogen and the fact that only few tuffs occurred in the host succession of Jiashengpan deposit suggest that the breakup process of the aulacogen orderly started from Tanyaokou in the west via Dongshengmiao to Jiashengpan in the east along the strike of Longshan? Zhaertaishan aulacogen,and the southern side(inside of the aulacogen)of Langshan cracked earlier than the northern side(outside of the aulacogen)of Langshan did along the dip of the aulacogen(e.g.from Dongshengmiao and Tangyaokou to Huogeqi),and the volcanic activities changed from strong to weak from Langshan aera to Zhaertaishan aera.",

GSD (Group-based Service Discovery) protocol is a typical service discovery protocol for MANETs. However, its packet overhead is high due to its much redundant packet transmissions. Some previous works improve GSD at the expense of slightly larger cache size and packet size. However, the added information can be used to improve protocol performance further. In this paper, FNMGSDP (Forward Node Minimization enhanced Group-based Service Discovery Protocol) is proposed to minimize the number of next hop nodes when forwarding request packets by exhaustively utilize the information in Service Information Cache.

The stabilization process can be divided into six sections, including deflagration, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) process, coexistence of detonation with deflagration, coexistence of strong u0026 weak detonations, unstable to stable detonation transition and stable detonation. The phenomenon of single-double-single wave transition is found and analyzed for the first time in the experiment. During the transition, the initial strong detonation wave weakens until it disappears, and the weak detonation wave becomes stronger until it propagates steadily. The reinitiation phenomenon is related to the injection pressures of the propellant. Increasing the injection pressure helps to reinitiate, thus avoiding the occurrence of the quenching phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rotating detonation engines of high thermal efficiency and specific impulse have been studied a lot. However, rotating detonation waves lead to uneven flow field, local high temperature and high pressure, tending to damage the combustor. An experimental way to keep both rotating detonation waves and deflagration in the combustor and to combine the advantages of rotating detonation engines and deflagration engines, is introduced here. Pressure sensors measure the pressure of rotating detonation waves and gas mass flow controllers control the mass flow rates of reactants. A standard speed camera captures the events of rotating detonation and deflagration. It is discovered that the rotating detonation is much more intense than deflagration. Both upstream rotating detonation waves and downstream deflagration respectively dependent on the trunk stream and the tributary can coexist in the combustor. The predetonator is the boundary between the detonation region and deflagration region in the combustor. The coexistence of detonation and deflagration weakens the combustion instability caused by rotating detonation, which may be helpful for rotating detonation to be applied.",

Then, the numerical values of clothing pressure of these postures were measured using three-dimension virtual-reality technology. Finally, the data mining technology was applied to analyze the collected data.FindingsThe wearing comfort of pants is mainly influenced by four factors – waist-hip factor, knee-shank factor, crotch factor and thigh-calf factor – and their contributions account for 39.17, 16.4, 13.96 and 6.95 percent, respectively. Hip, waist, crotch and knee influence wearing comfort significantly, and the part below the knee and the part of back thigh have no obvious effect on wearing comfort. Furthermore, the wearing comfort is acceptable if the numerical clothing pressures are below 20 kPa at the parts of hip, waist and crotch and below 10 kPa at the parts of back thigh, knee and shank.Originality/valueThe paper demonstrates how different human body parts influence garment-wearing comfort. All of the results in this research facilitate pattern design of pants and quantitative evaluation of garment-wearing comfort.",

        "abstract": "Synaptogenesis is considered necessary for learning and memory. Recently, it has been suggested that progesterone (PROG) effects synaptogenesis of the cerebellar Purkinje cell, helps alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis and helps arrest spinal cord neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear whether PROG influences synaptic plasticity in central nervous system neurons after global cerebral ischemia. The purpose of the present study was to reveal PROG's influence on postischemic synaptogenesis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by the 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method. To determine the amount of synaptogenesis, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and synaptophysin (SYP) expression were examined by immunohistochemical, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot techniques. Histological and behavioral tests were used to indicate the effect of PROG on global cerebral ischemia. Recovery times were 3, 7, 14, 21, and 35 days after surgery. We found that PROG increased the expression of GAP-43 and SYP. In addition, there was a significant increase in neuronal cell density and improvement ability to remain on an accelerating rotarod observed in the 4-VO rats treated with PROG compared to vehicle. We propose that PROG helped enable synaptogenesis in the CA1 region of therat hippocampus after global cerebral ischemia in rats.",

        "abstract": "A simply and sensitively electroanalytical method for the determination of bisphenol A (BPA) using ionic liquid n-octylpyridinum hexafluorophosphate (OPFP) and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composite electrode was presented. This electrode combined the advantages of ionic liquid and SWCNT as well as the characteristics of the \"bulk\" composite electrodes. Compared with bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and other composite electrode using graphite or paraffin oil, the ionic liquid-SWCNT (IL-SWCNT) composite electrode not only significantly enhanced the oxidation peak current of BPA, but also lowered the oxidation overpotential, suggesting that the IL-SWCNT electrode can remarkably improve the determining sensitivity of BPA. Factors influencing the detection processes were optimized and kinetic parameters were calculated. Under the optimal conditions, the oxidation current increased linearly with increasing the concentration of BPA in the range of 1.0 μM to 50.0 μM with a low detection limit of 0.5 μM. Furthermore, the IL-SWCNT electrode was applied to determine BPA levels in milk samples. Experimental results showed that the proposed electrode could be used as an effective and sensitive sensor for the determination of BPA.",

        "abstract": "Over expression of tissue factor (TF) occurs in more than 50 % of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, TF represents an attractive target antigen for immunotherapy in CRC.Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of a recombinant adenovirus vector encoding the light chain of human coagulation factor VII (hfVII-LC) and human IgG1 Fc fragment (hIgG1-Fc), termed \"benc vector,\" by targeting TF in the mouse model with colon cancer. Benc vector was administered intravenously or intratumorally in SCID mice with TF over-expressing HT-29 colon cancer. The safety and efficacy of benc vector were observed during animal experiments.Complete inhibition of tumor growth (5/5) was observed not only in the intravenously injection of benc vector group but also in the intratumorally of benc vector group. We also observed a precautionary effect on lung metastases of HT-29 cells by intratumoral injection of benc vector. In the control group of animals given empty control vector, all animals (5/5) developed lung tumors and exhibited a higher number of nodules after injection with HT-29 cells via the tail vein. In contrast, only three animals (3/5) in the treatment group receiving benc vector had any observable lung metastases and a lower number of nodules. No animals died and no bleeding was observed both in treatment groups and control groups. Moreover, only moderate liver damage was detected in mice receiving benc vector by intravenous injections.Benc vector encoding hfVII-LC and hIgG1-Fc can effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastases in SCID mice with TF over-expressing colon cancer and shows promise as an agent for CRC immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Light-trail is proposed as a candidate to carry IP traffic over wavelength-division multiplexing optical networks given its capability of enabling high-speed provisioning and accommodating multigranularity traffic. In a light-trail, the optical shutters at the start node and the end node are configured to be in OFF state and the optical shutters at the intermediate nodes are configured to be in ON state. Thus, an optical bus is formed, allowing traffic multiplexing without the state change of any optical shutter. This, however, limits the system throughput and also makes it impossible to implement a fully distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol to assure quality of service (QoS) in a light-trail. With the recent development on ultrafast optical shutter, we propose an improved light-trail architecture, called opportunistic hyperchannel in this paper. In an opportunistic hyperchannel, an intermediate node can dynamically control its optical shutter which makes it possible to design a fully distributed QoS assuring MAC protocol. We then present a QoS assuring distributed dynamic scheduling protocol, namely, minimum source round robin (minSrcRR) protocol, for opportunistic hyperchannels. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed QoS assuring protocol and the worst-case delay bound are also derived in this paper. The simulation results quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of opportunistic hyperchannels and the effectiveness of minSrcRR protocol.",

But the urban distribution network below 35kV has not developed into a sound pattern. Ad-hoc network featured with low power consumption, low operating cost, good fault tolerance and high reliability is now a new trend in the distribution communication. An improved routing protocol based on the AODV, which is named \"LQ-AODV\" is put forward for Ad-hoc network that is suitable for the urban distribution grid. By evaluating the quality of link, a qualitied routing is picked up by LQ-AODV as the communication path. In this way, the problem of defective realtime performance due to the deficiency of link evaluation is solved. This Ad-hoc network and LQ-AODV routing protocol has been tested in Huangshan Power Supply Company. It proves that it is an effective method in the distribution communication.",

        "abstract": "In a general context, the sharing of intermediate service results among different processes is seldom feasible because parameters are often different and there may be transactional and side effects. However, in a streaming video multicast environment, a large number of users often request various similar processing on the same stream. Therefore, service sharing is feasible, with a large potential of savings in processing cost. In this paper, we study the problem of determining the service invocation orders for multiple service composition requests in a streaming video multicast with the aim of maximizing the service sharing. We first formally define the problem. After proving the problem is NP-complete, we develop an optimal algorithm for the base case of two requests. Then for the general case, we develop two heuristic algorithms, namely, a global greedy algorithm and a local greedy algorithm using the optimal algorithm for the base case as the building block. The global greedy algorithm is designed for a system where the existing service composition requests can be recomposed with the arrival of a new request. The local greedy algorithm can be used in a system where the existing service composition requests do not change their service composition solutions with the arrival of a new request. We prove that the global greedy algorithm is a 2-approximation algorithm in terms of maximizing service sharing. Simulation results show that the greedy algorithms can save more service costs compared with a naive algorithm, and are effective compared with the cost lower bound.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting communication system enables energy to be dynamically harvested from natural resources and stored in capacitated batteries to be used for future data transmission. In such a system, the amount of future energy to harvest is uncertain and the battery capacity is limited. As a consequence, battery overflow and energy dropping may happen, causing energy underutilization. To maximize the data throughput by using the energy efficiently, a rate-adaptive transmission schedule must address the trade-off between a high-rate transmission which avoids energy overflow and a low-rate transmission which avoids energy shortage. In this paper, we study an online throughput maximization problem without knowing future information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the fully-online transmission rate scheduling problem for battery-capacitated energy harvesting communication systems. We consider the problem under two models of the communication channel, a static channel model that assumes the channel status is stable, and a fading channel model that assumes the channel status varies. For the former, we develop an online algorithm that approximates the offline optimal solution within a constant factor for all possible inputs. For the latter, that the channel gains vary in range $[h_{min},h_{max}]$ , we propose an online algorithm with a proven $\\\\Theta (\\\\log (\\\\frac{h_{max}}{h_{min}}))$ -competitive ratio. Our simulation results further validate the efficiency of the proposed online algorithms.",

Based on systematic sampling from drill holes ZK18, ZK30 and ZK40 in the Shuangwang breccias-type gold deposit, the authors mainly studied the crystal forms and thermoelectricity of pyrite, and have reached the following conclusions. The crystal forms of pyrite are fairly simple, comprising cube, octahedron, pentagonal dodecahedron and their composite combination, with the main crystal habit being {hk0}. Overall, the number of crystal forms is in decreasing order of {hk0}, {100}, {111}. The thermoelectric conductive type of pyrite is mainly N-P type, with the thermoelectric coefficients of Ntype pyrite ranging from-322.0 to-1.7μV·℃-1and those of P-type pyrite ranging from 1.7 to 346.7μV·℃-1; the thermoelectric parameters of pyrite vary greatly; the degree of denudation varies from 53.67% to 60.12%. All of the above data indicate a better exploration prospect at the depth of drill holes ZK18, ZK30 and ZK40 in No. 9 and No. 8 ore bodies.",

The U-Pb ages of zircons from the Hashitu granite and porphyry units are 147 �� 1. Ma and 143 �� 2. Ma, respectively. The Re-Os isochron age of molybdenites from the deposit is 150 �� 4. Ma. The molybdenite Re-Os model ages vary from 144 to 150. Ma, with a weighted mean of 147 �� 1. Ma. The results show that the ages of zircon crystallization and Mo mineralization are similar, mostly within analytical uncertainties, and that the host granite pluton is one of many late-Jurassic plutons in the Great Hinggan Range. The formation of the late-Jurassic granitic plutons in this region coincides with the subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North China block which took place ~2000. km to the east at the time. The occurrence of abundant late-Jurassic granitoids with compositions similar to the Hashitu pluton in the Great Hinggan Range is a positive sign for more discoveries of Mo deposits in this region. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "With the increased usage of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, improved surgical technique and stapling devices, sphincter-preserving resection has become more frequent for patients with rectal cancer. However, as for locally advanced ultra-low rectal cancer, sphincter-preservation is still facing an enormous challenge.To introduce an NLT strategy of sphincter-preservation-neoadjuvant therapy (NT) followed by local excision (LE) and two-stage total mesorectal excision (TME)-into the treatment of locally advanced ultra-low rectal cancer (lesions with anal sphincter invasion).From October 2010 to October 2011, nine patients with locally advanced rectal cancer located less than 3 cm from the anal verge were treated by the NLT strategy. All patients had shown good clinical response to NT. The LE procedure was carried transanally 6-8 weeks after completion of the NT. TME was performed to dissect mesorectal lymph nodes 4-6 weeks after LE.Of the nine patients, the lesion was assessed as T2 in two, T3 in five, and T4 in two before NT, and lymph node metastasis was detected in five patients. The median distance from the tumor to the anal verge was 2.5 cm (range: 1-3 cm). The median follow-up was 27 months (range: 24-34 months). No distant metastasis was detected. Only one patient (11.1%) developed local recurrence at 12 months post-operatively and then underwent abdomino-perineal resection. The remaining eight patients had preserved long-term continence and the median Wexner score at two years post-operation was 4 (range: 2-6).The new NLT strategy can achieve sphincter-preservation in some patients with ultra-low rectal cancer, with favorable oncological outcome and preservation of normal anal sphincter function.",

        "abstract": "\n In an integrated fiber and wireless (FiWi) access network, multi-path routing may be applied in the wireless subnetwork to\n improve throughput. Due to different delays along multiple paths, packets may arrive out of order, which may cause TCP performance\n degradation. Although the effect of packet reordering due to multi-path routing has been well studied, remedy solutions are\n either to schedule packets at the source node to proactively reduce the chance of packet reordering, or to modify TCP protocol.\n Resequencing packets arrived out-of-order has only been considered at the end systems which can cause long delay as packets\n must be buffered until there is no sequence gap. As all traffic in a FiWi network is sent to the Optical Line Terminal (OLT),\n the OLT serves as a convergence node which naturally makes it possible to resequence packets at the OLT before they are sent\n to the Internet. However, the challenge is that OLT must re-sequence packets effectively with a very small delay to avoid\n a performance hit. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm at the OLT to resequence packets while providing fairness.\n Simulation results validate that our packet scheduling algorithm is effective in improving the performance of TCP flows. Since\n resequencing is conducted in the access network which has a much fewer number of flows compared with those at routers, our\n proposed work provides a scalable solution to mitigate the side-effect of packet reordering caused by multi-path routing.\n \n ",

        "title": "Daratumumab (DARA) in Combination with Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone (KRd) in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MMY1001): Updated Results from an Open-Label, Phase 1b Study",
        "abstract": "Introduction:  Standard of care treatments for patients (pts) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) include triplet regimens containing a proteasome inhibitor (PI) or an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), with or without autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Among triplets, extended treatment with KRd has emerged as a highly active combination in NDMM (Jakubowiak AJ, et al.  Blood , 2012;120[9]:1801-1809). As multiple myeloma progresses, the depth and duration of clinical response is reduced with each treatment relapse, making it critical for front-line therapy to drive pts to deep and sustained clinical responses. Daratumumab (DARA) is a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting CD38 with direct on-tumor and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action. DARA induces rapid, deep, and durable responses in combination with dexamethasone and either bortezomib or an IMiD (lenalidomide or pomalidomide) in pts with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM; Palumbo A, et al.  NEJM  . 2016 375[8]:754-766; Dimopoulos MA, et al.  NEJM  . 2016 375[14]:1319-1331; Chari A, et al.  Blood  . 2017; epub, ahead of print). This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study investigated the safety profile and efficacy of DARA in combination with KRd in NDMM.   Methods:  Pts with NDMM were enrolled regardless of transplant eligibility, and had no evidence of clinically significant cardiac disease. Pts received a split first-dose of daratumumab (8 mg/kg on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1) and received 16 mg/kg weekly for the remainder of Cycles 1 and 2, every 2 weeks on Cycles 3-6, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Carfilzomib (K) 20 mg/m 2  was administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 and escalated to 70 mg/m 2  on Cycle1 Day 8, and was administered weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Pts received lenalidomide 25 mg on Days 1-21 of each cycle and dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/week. Pts were treated for ≤13 treatment cycles or until elective discontinuation for ASCT. Primary endpoints included safety and tolerability; overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, time to response, infusion-related reactions (IRR), and progression-free survival (PFS) were also examined. For DARA interference on serum immunofixation (IFE), a second reflex assay using an anti-idiotype mAb was used to confirm DARA migration on the IFE.   Results:  Among the 22 pts enrolled in the study, the median (range) age was 59.5 (34-74) years and 95% of pts had an ECOG score ≤1. After median (range) duration of follow-up of 13.1 (6.6-14.9) months, pts received a median (range) of 12 (1-13) treatment cycles. Treatment discontinuations were due to elective ASCT (n = 6), adverse events (AE; n = 1), and progressive disease (n = 1).  At the clinical cutoff date of June 16, 2017, the most common (u003e10%) grade 3/4 treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) included lymphopenia (14 [64%]), neutropenia (4 [18%]), diarrhea (4 [18%]), and pulmonary embolism (3 [14%]). Serious TEAEs occurred in 10 (46%) pts, with pulmonary embolism being the most common (3 [14%]). A transient grade 3 cardiac failure was reported in 1 pt who resumed treatment on Cycle 2 Day 1 with a reduced K dose (56 mg/m 2 ). IRRs (all grade 1 or 2) were reported in 27% of pts and occurred primarily during the first infusion. Median left ventricular ejection fraction did not change over time from baseline ( Table ).  21 response-evaluable pts achieved an ORR of 100%, including 43% stringent complete response (sCR), 14% complete response (CR), 33% very good partial response (VGPR), and 10% partial response (PR); responses deepened with treatment duration ( Figure ). Responses among 15 pts who did not undergo ASCT were as follows: 40% sCR, 20% CR, 27% VGPR, 13% PR. At the time of follow-up, all pts were alive and the 12-month PFS rate was 95% (95% confidence interval, 70-99). CD34 +  cell collection yields were consistent with previous KRd studies (median, 10.6 x 10 6  cells/kg) and 15/20 eligible pts had a response of ≥VGPR prior to stem cell harvest. Among the 20 eligible pts, median (range) number of cycles received prior to stem cell harvest was 5 (4-9).  Updated safety and efficacy data will be presented.   Conclusion:  DARA+KRd, with weekly K dosing, is well tolerated in pts with NDMM and demonstrates a safety profile consistent with previous reports of DARA and KRd. High response rates were observed with DARA+KRd and the depth of response improved with treatment duration. No adverse impact on stem cell collection was observed. These data support further investigation of DARA+KRd in NDMM.

The structures were determined by extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic data analyses, and the absolute configuration of these new compounds were undoubtedly confirmed by X-ray crystal diffrations. Compound 1 is a rare spiroaxane sesquiterpenoid and the absolute configuration of spiroaxane sesquiterpenoid was determined for the first time. Compound 2 is the first drimane-type sesquiterpenoid containing both amino acid residue and butanediol group. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed significant suppressive effect on the production of NO on LPS induced BV-2 cells, with IC values ranging from 4.97 to 7.81 μM. In addition, 1, 4, and 5 exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activities against the production of TNF-α and IL-6. Further immunofluorescence experiments revealed the mechanism of action to be inhibitory the NF- κB-activated pathway.",

The implementation of safety development concept relies on the safety sustainable development,and so the comprehensive,coordinative and sustainable safety development concept must be built up. System dynamics model of safety system is established by using system thinking method,this model shows that the safety degree of system will decline under the influence of the 4 variables of staff,mechanical equipment,environment and management,which cause the sustainable safety system get into the critical sustainable state,and ultimately into the unsustainable safety state that leads to the injury and fatal accident. Also the simulation result is reviewed with consideration on the factors of safety cask.",

        "abstract": "High density DNA methylation microarrays were used to study the differences of gene methylation level in six pairs of colorectal cancer (CRC) and adjacent normal mucosa. We analyzed the profile of methylated genes by NimbleGen Microarray and the biologic functions by NIH-NAVID. In addition, preliminary validation studies were done in six pairs of samples by MSP (methylation-specific PCR). A total of 4,644 genes had a difference in methylation levels. Among them 2,296 were hypermethylated (log2ratio > 1), 2,348 genes were hypomethylated (log2ratio < -1), in which 293 hypermethylated and 313 hypomethylated genes were unmapped according to the NIH-NAVID. All these genes were randomly distributed on all the chromosomes. However, chromosome 1 contained the most of the hypermethylated genes (232 genes), followed by chromosome 19 (149 genes), chromosome 11 (144 genes), chromosome 2 (141 genes), chromosomes 3 (127 genes). Through the analysis of the statistics, There were 2 hypermethylated/3 hypomethylated genes involved in six pairs of samples simultaneously, followed by 10/14 in five samples, 34/37 in four samples, 101/113 in three samples, 341/377 in two samples, 1,808/1,804 in one sample. According to gene ontology analysis, some physiological processes play important roles in the cell division and the development of tumor, such as apoptosis, DNA repair, immune, cell cycle, cell cycle checkpoint, cell adhesion and invasion etc. Through Preliminary validation, there were two genes (St3gal6, Opcml) in thirty top-ranking genes shown hypermethylated in six pairs of CRC and adjacent normal mucosa.High density DNA methylation microarrays is an effective method for screening aberrantly methylated genes in CRC. The methylated genes should be further studied for diagnostic or prognostic markers for CRC.",

The surface morphologies, phase change properties, and thermal stabilities of the microcapsules were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. The results show the two-phase core materials are well encapsulated in the presence of the emulsifier sodium salt of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer. The average diameter of the microcapsules is about 35 μm. The crystallization temperature of MicroPCMs is higher than that of MicroPCMs without PPy. At the same time, the enthalpy of the heterogeneous nucleation significantly increased with increasing of the PPy concentration. Microcapsules with 4-14 wt % PPy in the core material were free from obvious supercooling, and PPy had no influence on the morphology, the particle distribution, or the thermal resistant temperature of microcapsules. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a new WDM optical network infrastructure named SMART [1], which is capable of dynamically setting up, modifying, and tearing down optical connections, was proposed. The performance of SMART is determined by the performance of its hyperchannels, which are essentially optical buses or light-trails. Previously proposed CSMA protocols for unidirectional optical buses can be used as distributed medium access control protocols for hyperchannels. However, these protocols are either unfair, or not work-conserving. In this paper, we propose a class of work-conserving, collision-free, and fair CSMA protocols for opportunistic hyperchannels which are tailored hyperchannels for SMART. We show that the performances of our proposed protocols are much better than that of pi-persistent CSMA and that of priority-based CSMA protocol in terms of throughput and fairness.",

If implemented, this technology can reduce costs and improve efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model to predict pattern making-related body dimensions by inputting few key human body dimensions. In order to construct the proposed model, anthropometric measurements of 120 young females from the northeastern region of China were collected. The data were then used for training and the proposed model. The results showed that the prediction of the developed BP-ANN model is more accurate and stable than that of linear regression (LR) model. As great as the LR model was at pattern making, the BP-ANN model is even better. In the future, the precision of the proposed model can be further improved if the size of the learning data increases. The proposed method can be especially useful in making garment patte...",

Eligible patients received docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/m(2) bolus followed by 2,400 mg/m(2) 46-h infusion), fortnightly. Prophylactic use of G-CSF was adopted in all patients. The primary end point was response rate (RR). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity and QoL. Thirty-nine patients with a median age of 55 (28-80) were included. The RR was 51.3 %. Median PFS and OS were 6.7 and 14.0 months, respectively. The most common adverse events (all grades) were anemia (34, 87.2 %), fatigue (29, 74.4 %), neutropenia (26, 66.7 %), nail change (19, 48.7 %) and liver dysfunction (15, 38.5 %). In QoL analysis, improvements were obtained in seven scales, whereas drops were seen in three scales. Common Grade 3/4 toxicities included anemia (28.2 %), liver dysfunction (7.7 %) and fatigue (7.7 %). This novel regimen is a promising option for AGC, showing high RR, improvement on QoL and acceptable toxicity.",

        "abstract": "The joint segregation analysis of a mixed genetic model of major gene plus poly-gene was conducted to study the inheri-tance of oil content in Brassica napus L.. Five populations, i.e the populations of 2 parents( P1 and P2), F1, F2 and F2:3 (derived from F2 ) family, from each of the two crosses (1141B × Ken C1-1, 32B × Ken C1-2) were investigated.The frequency distributions of oil content in F2 and F2:3 family populations show characteristics of a mixed normal distribution, which indicated that the inheritance of oil content followed a major gene plus poly-gene model. Twenty-one genetic models were established, which could be classified into five types: one and two major genes, polygenes, one and two major genes plus polygenes. The most suitable genetic model could be selected using Akaike’s Information Criterion and the fitness of the selected one could be examined by a set of tests. Re-sults show that genetic model D-2 is the most fitting genetic model for the trait. In other words, oil content in oilseed rape is con-trolled by one additive major gene plus additive and dominance polygenes. For cross 1 (1141B × Ken C1-1) the heritabilities of major gene and poly-genes in F2 are 68.21% and 27.17%, respectively, and in F2:3 are 81.70% and 16.80% , respectively. The addi-tive effect of major gene is –1.74, which indicates that the locus of the allele in parent 1141B may decrease the oil content, but that in parent Ken C1-1 may increase it. The additive and dominance effects of the polygenes are 1.20 and –1.93, respectively. For cross 2 (32B × Ken C1-2) the heritabilities of major gene and polygenes in F2 are 66.20% and 28.10%, respectively, and in F2:3 were 81.00% and 14.90%, respectively . The additive effect of major gene was –3.74, which also indicates that the locus of the allele in parent 32B may decrease the oil content, but that in parent Ken C1-2 may increase it. The additive and dominance effects are –1.99 and 0.93, respectively. The heritability of the major gene in F2:3 is higher than that in F2 in both crosses, so it would be more efficent to conduct selection in F2:3 families for high oil content in breeding.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects of dietary iron (Fe) levels on manganese (Mn) utilization, 900 8-day-old broilers were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatments in a 3 (Fe level) × 2 (Mn level) factorial arrangement after feeding Mn- and Fe-unsupplemented diet for 7 days. The broilers were then fed with basal corn-soybean meal diets (approximately 28 mg Mn/kg and 60 mg Fe/kg) added with 0, 80, or 160 mg/kg Fe (L-Fe, M-Fe, or H-Fe), and 0 or 100 mg/kg Mn for 35 days. Body weight gain was lower for H-Fe broilers than that for L-Fe and M-Fe broilers. On day 42, H-Fe broilers had lower serum Mn concentration as compared with L-Fe and M-Fe broilers, and tibia Mn concentration decreased as dietary Fe increased. In Mn-supplemented broilers, liver Mn was lower in L-Fe and H-Fe treatments than that in M-Fe treatment. H-Fe treatment decreased Mn concentration and manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity in the heart when compared with L-Fe and M-Fe treatments. Dietary Fe did not significantly influence Mn concentrations in the liver and heart, and heart MnSOD activity in Mn-unsupplemented broilers. In the duodenum, L-Fe treatment decreased divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA abundance when compared with M-Fe and H-Fe treatments, and ferroportin 1 (FPN1) mRNA level was higher in M-Fe treatment than that in L-Fe and H-Fe treatments. These results suggested H-Fe diet decreased Mn status in broilers evaluated by Mn concentrations in serum and heart, and heart MnSOD activity. Dietary Fe influenced Mn absorption possibly through effects on duodenal DMT1 and FPN1 expression.",

Wave structure evolution is classified into four categories, namely two-wave collision (counter-rotating waves), abscission of detonation tail, and shock wave to detonation transition. Two-wave collision consists of symmetric detonation collision, asymmetric detonation collision, and detonation/shock collision. Two symmetric detonation waves turn into shock waves after collision. Collision of asymmetric detonation waves creates single detonation wave. The detonation/shock collision decreases the detonation wave intensity. Abscission of detonation tail and shock to detonation transition can both create single detonation wave or two opposite-direction detonation waves, depending on the wave hitting angle and the amount of fresh gas. All phenomena mentioned above affect the number of detonation waves in the combustion chamber.",

        "title": "Analysis of Quality of Surveillance in fusion-based sensor networks.",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the deployments of wireless sensor networks for mission-critical applications such as battlefield monitoring and security surveillance. These appli- cations often impose stringent Quality of Surveillance (QoSv) requirements including low false alarm rate and short detection delay. In practice, collaborative data fusion techniques that can deal with sensing uncertainty and enable sensor collaboration have been widely employed in sensor systems to achieve stringent QoSv requirements. However, most previous analytical studies on the surveillance performance of wireless sensor networks are based on simplistic models (such as the disc model) that cannot capture the stochastic and collaborative nature of sensing. In this paper, we systematically analyze the fundamental relationship between QoSv, network density, sensing parameters, and target properties. The results show that data fusion is effective in achieving stringent QoSv requirements, especially in the senarios with low signal-to- noise ratios (SNRs). In contrast, the disc model is only suitable when the SNR is sufficiently high. Our results help understand the limitations of disc model and provide insights into improving QoSv of sensor networks using data fusion. work to study the QoSv of large-scale WSNs that adopt col- laborative data fusion algorithms. To quantify the fundamental trade-off between detection delay and false alarm rate, we proposed a new QoSv metric called �-delay that is defined as the average delay of detecting mobile targets subject to the false alarm rate bound �. In this paper, we significantly extend our previous study in several important aspects. First, unlike most existing analytical studies (3), (8) that adopt a specific target signal decay model, we assume a general power-law decay model that can characterize the attenuation of many physical signals, e.g., acoustic and electromagnetic signals. Second, we aim to extend our analysis to the case of arbitrary target speed, which is in contrast to (8) where target speed is assumed to be very high. Due to the arbitrary target speed, successive data fusion processes may be statistically correlated because of the sharing of common sensors. Such correlation among data fusion processes substantially complicates the analysis of QoSv. The main contributions of this paper include: • We present new analytical results on the QoSv of fusion- based sensor networks for intrusion detection. The results can be used to achieve desirable trade-offs between false alarm rate, detection delay and network density. • To understand the limitation of the disc model and the impact of data fusion on the QoSv of WSNs, we con- duct comparative analysis between the two models. In particular, we show that the ratio of network densities to achieve the minimum �-delay under the two models has an asymptotic upper bound of O",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:Comparing tolerance and 3-year survival rate of XELOX regimen and mFOLFOX6 regimen applying in adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III gastric cancer. METHODS: Retrospective analyzed consecutive 60 gastric cancer patients with stage III gastric cancer from January 2004 to April 2007, among them 31 patients received XELOX regimen, 29 received FOLFOX regimen post operatively. NCI-CTC 3. 0 criteria was used to evaluate the toxicity. Three year survival rate was compared with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: The adverse events occurrence rate in the two group were not significant different, except the occurrence of hand-foot syndrome was significantly higher in the XELOX group(51. 6% vs 13. 8%, P<0. 05). The most common grade III-IV adverse events in both groups were nausea/vomiting (32. 2% vs 34. 5%) and white blood cell decrease(12. 8% vs 17. 2%). The 3-year survival rate in XELOX and FOLFOX group was 48. 3% and 63. 0% respectively (P = 0. 122). The estimate mean survival time were 31. 3 months and 37. 4 months respectively (P = 0. 204). CONCLUSIONS: Both XELOX regimen and mFOLFOX6 regimen are safe and well tolerated when applying in patients with stage III gastric cancer. The efficacy of the two regimens is identical. Regimens containing both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are superior to 5-fluorouracil alone and should be first choice regimens in adjuvant setting treating stage III gastric cancer patients.",

Computations based on this model are in good agreement with the\n experiments (Didden (1979) for circular tube and Auerbach (1987) for 2D tube and opening). Using this new model, evidences\n are provided to show that the main failure of the similarity theory (the false prediction of axial trajectory of vortex ring)\n is due to its ignorance of the self-induced ring velocity (mutual induction for vortex pair). We further reason why the similarity\n theory succeeds in its prediction of radial movement of vortex ring. The effects of various parameters such as turning angle\n α and piston speedU\n \n p\n \n (t) on the formation of vortex ring are investigated. Numerical result shows that turning angle α has no effect on circulation\n shed τ. We also discuss Glezer (1988)'s summary on the influence ofU\n \n p\n  upon the shedding circulation, and finally give the variation of core distribution of vortex ring with α andU\n \n p\n \n (t).",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that an increase in CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells may contribute to stroke-induced immunosuppression. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this increase in Treg cells remain unclear. Here, we used a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice and specific pathway inhibitors to demonstrate that stroke activates the sympathetic nervous system, which was abolished by 6-OHDA. The consequent activation of β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in bone marrow. β2-AR antagonist prevented the upregulation of PGE2. PGE2, which acts on prostaglandin E receptor subtype 4 (EP4), upregulated the expression of receptor activator for NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in CD4(+) T cells and mediated the increase in Treg cells in bone marrow. Treatment of MCAO mice with RANKL antagonist OPG inhibited the increase in percent of bone marrow Treg cells. PGE2 also elevated the expression of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in CD11C(+) dendritic cells and promoted the development of functional Treg cells. The effect was neutralized by treatment with indomethacin. Concurrently, stroke reduced production of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) via β3-AR signals in bone marrow but increased the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 4 in Treg and other bone marrow cells. Treatment of MCAO mice with β3-AR antagonist SR-59230A reduced the percent of Treg cells in peripheral blood after stroke. The disruption of the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis may facilitate mobilization of Treg cells and other CXCR4(+) cells into peripheral blood. This mechanism could account for the increase in Treg cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and progenitor cells in peripheral blood after stroke. We conclude that cerebral ischemia can increase bone marrow CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells via signals from the sympathetic nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) plays a key role in the regulation of apoptosis. The function of NFκB is inhibited by binding to NFκB inhibitor (IκB), and disruption of the balance of NFκB and IκB is related to the development of many diseases, including tumors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the NFκB1 (-94del/insATTG) and NFκBIA (2758 A>G) polymorphisms were associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility.In a hospital-based case-control study of 1001 CRC patients and 1005 cancer-free controls frequency matched by age and sex, we genotyped polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and performed luciferase assays and Western blotting analysis to identify whether genetic variants in NFκBIA alter its gene expressions and functions and thus cancer risk.We found that both NFκB1-94 ins/delATTG and NFκBIA 2758 A>G polymorphisms were correlated with CRC risk (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.14-1.86, and OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.14-1.66, respectively). Furthermore, when evaluated these two polymorphisms together, the combined genotypes with 2 variant (risk) alleles (2758GG and -94ins/ins+del/ins) were associated with an increased risk of CRC (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.23-2.38) compared to 0 variant, and the significant trend for 2 variant (risk) alleles were more pronounced among subgroups of aged <60 years, women, never drinkers, never smokers, persons with a normal BMI and those with a family history of cancer(P(trend)<0.01). Moreover, luciferase assays showed that the G allele in the 3'UTR significantly decreased NFκBIA mRNA stability and the A allele regulation by miRNA449a in vitro and that the NFκBIA protein expression levels of the AA+AG variant carriers were significantly higher in peritumoral tissues than those of the 2758GG genotype.NFκB1 and NFκBIA polymorphisms appear to jointly contribute to risk of CRC. These two variants may be a genetic modifier for CRC susceptibility in this southern Chinese population.",

In this study, we determined the level of phosphorylated MEK5 (pMEK5) expression in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and correlated it with clinicopathologic data.pMEK5 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 335 clinicopathologic characterized CRC cases and 80 cases of nontumor colorectal tissues. pMEK5 expression of 19 cases of primary CRC lesions and paired with normal mucosa was examined by Western blotting. The relationship between pMEK5 expression in CRC and clinicopathologic parameters, and the association of pMEK5 expression with CRC survival were analyzed respectively.pMEK5 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues (185 out of 335, 55.2%) than in normal tissues (6 out of 80, 7.5%; P < 0.001). Western blotting demonstrated that pMEK5 expression was upregulated in 12 of 19 CRC tissues (62.1%) compared to the corresponding adjacent nontumor colorectal tissues. Overexpression of pMEK5 in CRC tissues was significantly correlated to the depth of invasion (P = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), distant metastasis (P < 0.001) and high preoperative CEA level (P < 0.001). Consistently, the pMEK5 level in CRC tissues was increased following stage progression of the disease (P < 0.001). Analysis of the survival curves showed a significantly worse 5-year disease-free (P = 0.002) and 5-year overall survival rate (P < 0.001) for patients whose tumors overexpressed pMEK5. However, in multivariate analysis, pMEK5 was not an independent prognostic factor for CRC (DFS: P = 0.139; OS: P = 0.071).pMEK5 expression is correlated with the staging of CRC and its expression might be helpful to the TNM staging system of CRC.",

        "abstract": "Cell-based therapy is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke treatment. Although unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) have been tried in both preclinical and clinical trials, the effective subpopulations need to be identified. In this study, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to harvest the CXCR4(+)CD45(+) and CXCR4(+)CD45(-) BMMNC subpopulations from transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein. We then allogeneically grafted unfractionated BMMNCs or a subpopulation into mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and compared the effects on stroke outcomes. We found that CXCR4(+)CD45(-) BMMNCs, but not CXCR4(+)CD45(+) BMMNCs, more effectively reduced infarction volume and neurologic deficits than did unfractionated BMMNCs. Brain tissue from the ischemic hemisphere of mice treated with CXCR4(+)CD45(-) BMMNCs had higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and lower levels of TNF-α than did tissue from mice treated with unfractionated BMMNCs. In contrast, CXCR4(+)CD45(+) BMMNCs showed an increase in TNF-α. Additionally, CXCR4(+)CD45(+) and CXCR4(+)CD45(-) populations exhibited more robust migration into the lesion areas and were better able to express cell-specific markers of different linages than were the unfractionated BMMNCs. Endothelial and astrocyte cell markers did not colocalize with eGFP(+) cells in the brains of tMCAO mice that received CXCR4(+)CD45(+) BMMNCs. In vitro, the CXCR4(+)CD45(-) BMMNCs expressed significantly more Oct-4 and Nanog mRNA than did the unfractionated BMMNCs. However, we did not detect gene expression of these two pluripotent markers in CXCR4(+)CD45(+) BMMNCs. Taken together, our study shows for the first time that the CXCR4(+)CD45(-) BMMNC subpopulation is superior to unfractionated BMMNCs in ameliorating cerebral damage in a mouse model of tMCAO and could represent a new therapeutic approach for stroke treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective: As an activator of JNK and p38, phosphorylated MKK4 is considered to be associated with tumor progression and prognosis. This study was to examine the expression of pMKK4 and evaluate its prognostic significance in colorectal carcinoma. Methods: A total of 343 cases of colorectal cancer were followed up to analyze the associations between the expression of pMKK4 and various clinicopathological factors. The expression of Serine257/Threonine261 pMKK4 was detected immunohistochemically by tissue microarray. Results: The staining of pMKK4 was present in cytoplasm of colorectal carcinoma. And the expression of pMKK4 was correlated with invasion depth (P = 0.003), differentiation (P = 0.018), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), metastasis (P < 0.001), hepatic metastasis (P = 0.039) and TNM stage (P <0.001). The patients with strong pMKK4 staining had a better overall survival than those with lowered levels (bog rank = 4.531, P = 0.033). Univariate analysis indicated that the expression of pMKK4 was correlated with either overall survival (HR = 0.785, P = 0.035) or relapse-free survival (HR = 0.788, P = 0.044). In multivariate analysis, there was no prognostic significance of pMKK4 after adjusting for invasion depth, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, metastasis, liver metastasis and TNM stage. Conclusions: The down-regulation of S257/T261 pMKK4 is associated with more advanced stages and it plays an important role in tumor progression. A high-level expression of pMKK4 indicates favorable clinical outcomes, but it is not an independent predictor. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.",

        "abstract": "Bedded acid volcanic rocks, which preserve blasto-glomeroporphyritic or porphyritic crystals consisting of quartz and albite with clear evidence of alterations and deformations, from the Mesoproterozoic Zha’ertaishan Group in the southwestern section of Langshan, Inner Mongolia were analyzed. Zircons from two acid volcanic rock samples, A8-0 and A14-5, were separated. The zircons exhibited an igneous morphology, oscillatory zonings and relatively high Th/U ratios, and they were mostly pris-matic or short prisms either colorless or brown in color, suggesting a magmatic origin. SHRIMP U-Pb dating was carried out and the 20 measurement points obtained from sample A8-0 yielded a weighted average 206Pb/238U age of 805±5 Ma. Twenty measurements were also taken on the A14-5 sample, but five points (3.1, 6.1, 7.1, 20.1 and 21.1) were discarded because of their higher 206Pb/238U ages (867.0 ± 10, 829.1 ± 8.0, 849.7 ± 9.8, 839.2 ± 9.7 and 830.7 ± 9.3 Ma, respectively). The remaining 15 points yielded a weighted average 206Pb/238U age of 814 ± 4.6 Ma. These ages are interpreted as the timing of an acid volcanic eruption and thus represent a Neoproterozoic (805–814 Ma) submarine volcanic eruption in the southwestern section of Lang-shan, Inner Mongolia. Geochemical data show that the acid volcanic rock is enriched in light rare earth and high field strength elements, but depleted in heavy rare earth and lithophile elements that have well-developed Eu anomalies similar to those of the Neoproterozoic volcanic rocks. These rocks are comparatively depleted in high field strength elements Th, Nb, Ta, Hf, Zr, and from the western Yangtze block and Ciwu, Zhejiang, revealing that the acidic magma had erupted in. We suggest that this sub-marine volcanic eruption is probably related to the breakup of Rodinia in Langshan, Inner Mongolia. This discovery, together with the ages of 814–872 Ma reported for the neighboring terranes of Jinningian deformed granites in the Alax area and the age of 827 Ma for the ultramafic rock (ultramafite) in Jinchuan, as well as the recent report of magma activities during the Neopro-terozoic in the North China Platform and adjacent areas, is of significance help in understanding the Rodinia evolution in the western section of Langshan, Inner Mongolia.",

        "abstract": "Nano-encapsulated n-octadecane (NanoPCMs) was synthesized by free-radical emulsion polymerization using a styrene-divinylbenzene co-polymer as the shell and n-octadecane as the core. The surface morphologies, thermal properties, thermal stability, diameter distribution and the structure of the nanocapsules were investigated using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TG), laser diffraction particle size analysis, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. The experimental results show that, the use of a stirring speed of higher than 6000 rpm is suitable for the nano-encapsulation in the presence of blended emulsifier, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and polyoxyethylene (10) nonyl phenyl ether (NP-10). Dodecyl mercaptan (DDM) has a great influence on the morphology and thermal properties of NanoPCMs under the experimental conditions. When the content of DDM is 0.016 g, nanocapsules were regular spheres and their surfaces are smooth. The enthalpy of the nanocapsules is 87 J.g-1. The thermal resistant temperature of NanoPCMs is about 226 °C. © 2013 by American Scientific Publishers.",

Given the scarcity of GI PEComas and their relatively short follow-up periods, our current knowledge of their biologic behavior, molecular genetic alterations, diagnostic criteria, and prognostic factors continues to be very limited.We present 2 cases of GI PEComas, one of which showed an aggressive histologic behavior that underwent multiple combined chemotherapies. We also review the available English-language medical literature on GI PEComas-not otherwise specified (PEComas-NOS) and discuss their clinicopathological and molecular genetic features.Pathologic analyses including histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural studies were performed to evaluate the clinicopathological features of GI PEComas, their diagnosis, and differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and DNA sequencing assays were carried out to detect the potential molecular genetic alterations in our cases. Microscopically, the tumors showed distinctive histologic features of PEComas-NOS, including fascicular or nested architecture, epithelioid or spindled cell type, and clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for melanocytic markers. Molecular pathological assays confirmed a PSF-TFE3 gene fusion in one of our cases. Furthermore, in this case microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and its downstream genes were found to exhibit elevated transcript levels.Knowledge about the molecular genetic alterations in GI PEComas is still limited and warrants further study.",

Examination of Au 2 Te grains from the Sandaowanzi gold deposit, utilizing optical microscope, EPMA, SEM backscattered electron, and X-ray images revealed an apparently homogeneous composition leading to its examination as a possible new mineral. However, high resolution SEM, TEM, and micro-zone XRD analyses demonstrate that the Au 2 Te phase gives a false stoichiometry and is not a new mineral species, but a mixture of native gold and calaverite with a nanographic texture that is highly comparable to that of the Turing pattern. This finding implies that the nanographic textures of Au 2 Te composed of alternating growth layers of native gold (Au) and calaverite (AuTe 2 ) are attributable to decomposition or breakdown of the previous metastable phases during cooling.",

        "abstract": "5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is the main chemotherapeutic approach for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Because chemoresistance occurs frequently and significantly limits CRC therapies, a novel agent is needed. Pseudolaric acid B (PAB), a small molecule derived from the Chinese medicinal herb ''Tujinpi'', exhibits strong cytotoxic effects on a variety of cancers. However, the detailed mechanisms by which PAB inhibits CRC cell growth and its potential role in overcoming 5-FU resistance have not been well studied. In this study, we showed that PAB significantly inhibited the viability of various CRC cell lines but induced minor cytotoxicity in normal cells. Both the in vitro and in vivo results showed that PAB induced proliferation inhibition, mitotic arrest and subsequently caspase-dependent apoptosis in both 5-FU-sensitive and -resistant CRC cells. Moreover, PAB was shown to interfere with CRC cell mitotic spindle apparatus and activate the spindle assembly checkpoint. Finally, CDK1 activity was involved in PAB-induced mitotic arrest and apoptosis in CRC cells. Taken together, these data reveal that PAB induces CRC cell mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis and overcomes 5-FU resistance in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that PAB may be a potential agent for CRC treatment, particularly for 5-FU-resistant CRC.",

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), one major challenge is how to prolong the network lifetime while maintaining a certain data collection rate for resource-limited static sensors. To achieve this goal, many mobility-assisted data collection (MADC) schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis on the behaviors of the MADC models in terms of both throughput capacity, which is defined as the maximal data collection rate, and lifetime, which will be associated with a specific data collection rate. In this paper, we address this issue in a large-scale WSN with mobile sinks from a theoretical perspective, which has not yet been studied. In particular, we first propose a general MADC model that includes many important parameters such as the number of mobile sinks, the velocity of a mobile sink, and the traveling path of a mobile node. We then develop a comprehensive theoretical approach to obtain the achievable throughput capacity and lifetime. By applying the proposed approach, we investigate the behaviors of WSNs with one or more mobile sinks. Our analysis not only shows how a WSN with mobile sinks can outperform a static WSN but also provides insights on how we can adjust the MADC parameters to improve the data collection rate and to maximize the lifetime. Finally, our analysis is validated through extensive simulations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The vibration of high speed turbine handpiece during post space and post core preparation has an adverse effect on the continuous force of the bonding interfaces among the cement, dentin and post core, which influences the apical sealing effect of post core. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of post space and post core preparation at different time on apical microleakage with fiber posts system. METHODS: Totally 55 extracted mandibular premolars each with single root canal were biomechanically prepared by using the step back technique. The samples were divided into five groups randomly: the immediate post space preparation group, 2 days after post space preparation group, 1 week after post space preparation group, a positive control group and a negative control group. Each group was averagely divided into three subgroups and they all were mixed for 15, 30 and 60 minutes on the cements, and then performed post core preparation. After that, all roots were dyed and transparentized. The dyeing scores of apical microleakage in each group were recorded under stereoscopic microscope observation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The score of apical microleakage in 1 week after post space preparation group was obviously higher than that in 2 days after post space preparation group. There were significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). No significant difference was shown for the microleakage of post core preparation after mixed for 15, 30 and 60 minutes on the cements (P > 0.05). These findings suggest that the immediate post space preparation can play a good protective effect on apical sealing. In terms of fiber posts, there are not effects of post core preparation at different time on apical microleakage after the same kind of cement solidified completely.",

Existing solutions apply classic classifiers to make real-time decision based on the traffic features of present moment. However, due to the frequently happening burst and noise in dynamic Internet traffic, the decision based on short-term features is not reliable. To address this problem, we propose MS-LSTM, a multi-scale Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to consider the Internet flow as a multi-dimensional time sequence and learn the traffic pattern from historical features in a sliding time window. In addition, we find that adopting different time scale to preprocess the traffic flow has great impact on the performance of all classifiers. In this paper, comprehensive experiments are conducted and the results show that a proper time scale can improve about 10% accuracy of LSTM as well as all conventional machine learning methods. Particularly, MS-LSTM with optimal time scale 8 can achieve 99.5% accuracy in the best case.",

        "abstract": "The study was aimed to investigate the relationship between hypermethylation of Syk gene and clinicopathological characteristics and long-term outcomes in colorectal cancer. The effect of Syk on cell proliferation and invasion ability was also assessed. Methylation and expression status of Syk were explored in CRC tissues and cell lines by MSP, qRT-PCR and western blot assay. The effects of Syk overexpression on tumorigenesis were studied by in vitro assay. The correlation between Syk methylation and clinical relevance in CRC patients was also analyzed. Syk methylation was found 48.6 % in CRC tissue samples and 57.1 % in cell lines, respectively. The loss of Syk expression could be restored by demethylation agent. Overexpression of Syk in CRC cell inhibited cell proliferation (p < 0.01) and invasion (p < 0.01). The methylation of Syk was significantly associated with histological grade (p = 0.002), lymph node status (p < 0.001) and TNM stage (p < 0.001). Five-year overall survival in methylated Syk group was significantly lower than that in unmethylated Syk group (59 vs. 80 %, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Syk methylation was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Syk is identified as a potential tumor suppressor in CRC progression. Syk methylation is correlated with poor overall survival, which acts as an independent prognostic indicator of CRC.",

In this method, LS-SVM was used for establishing model of spectral analysis, and was applied to predict the sugar contents (SC) and available acid (VA) in tomato juice samples. NIR transmission spectra of tomato juice were measured in the spectral range of 800-2,500 nm using InGaAs detector. The radial basis function (RBF) was adopted as a kernel function of LS-SVM. Sixty seven tomato juice samples were used as calibration set, and thirty three samples were used as validation set. The results of the method for sugar contents (SC) and available acid (VA) prediction were: a high correlation coefficient of 0.9903 and 0.9675, and a low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.0056 degree Brix and 0.0245, respectively. And compared to PLS and PCR methods, the performance of the LSSVM method was better. The results indicated that it was possible to built statistic models to quantify some common components in tomato juice using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) regression method as a nonlinear multivariate calibration procedure, and LS-SVM could be a rapid and accurate method for juice components determination based on NIR spectra.",

        "abstract": "The Bainaimiao copper deposit of Inner Mongolia is located in the copper polymetallic belt of the Ondor Sum Caledonian accretion zone in Xing'an-Mongolia orogenic belt. The deposit is comprised of the northern and the southern ore belts. The host rock of the southern ore belt is greenschist, whereas the orebodies in the northern belt mainly occurred in the Caledonian granodiorite porphyry. Because of its complicated process of mineralization, the metallogenesis of this deposit is rather debatable and the study of this deposit is of great significance. The present paper is the first time to report accurate Re-Os isotopic data acquired from 7 crystals of molybdenite separated from this deposit. The Re-Os isotopic model age ranges from (439.6±6.4) Ma to (450.0±6.6) Ma and weighted average age is (446.5±3.5) Ma. The Re-Os isotope analysis also gives an isochronal age of (451.2±3.5) Ma and the MSWD is 1.3. Combined with the geological features of the deposit, it is concluded that the deposit is a porphyry copper deposit produced by island arc granodioritic porphyry on the basis of the primitive exhalative sedimentary mineralization under a subduction environment. Therefore, the metallogenesis of the deposit should belong to the multiple superimposed mineralizations.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the association between postoperative body temperature and prognosis in patients with rectal cancer. Five hundred and seven patients with stage I to III rectal cancers were enrolled in the current study. Basal body temperature (BBT, measured at 6 am) and maximal body temperature (MBT) on each day after surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two equal groups according to the median of BBT and MBT at each day. The primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The univariate and multivariate analyses showed that patients with low D0-MBT (<37.4 °C) had lower 3-year DFS [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.56 (95 % CI 1.08-2.24, P = 0.017)] as well as OS [adjusted HR 1.72 (95 % CI 1.05-2.82, P = 0.032)] rate as compared to those with high D0-MBT (>37.4 °C). In the subset of 318 patients with T3 stage tumor and the subgroup of 458 patients without blood transfusion as well, low D0-MBT continues to be an independent predictor of DFS/OS with an adjusted HR equal to 1.48 (95 % CI 1.02-2.24, P = 0.046)/1.68 (95 % CI 1.04-2.99, P = 0.048) and 1.45 (95 % CI 1.02-2.13, P = 0.048)/1.59 (95 % CI 1.01-2.74, P = 0.049), respectively. In addition, we found that patients have higher risk of 1-year recurrence if those were exhibiting low preoperative BBT (<36.6 °C) (17 vs. 10 %, P = 0.034). Low body temperature (D0-MBT < 37.4 °C) after surgery was an independent predictor of poor survival outcomes in patients with rectal cancer.",

        "abstract": "A label-free capacitive immunosensor based on quartz crystal Au electrode was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7. The immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing affinity-purified anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibodies onto self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) on the surface of a quartz crystal Au electrode. Bacteria suspended in solution became attached to the immobilized antibodies when the immunosensor was tested in liquid samples. The change in capacitance caused by the bacteria was directly measured by an electrochemical detector. An equivalent circuit was introduced to simulate the capacitive immunosensor. The immunosensor was evaluated for E. coli O157:H7 detection in pure culture and inoculated food samples. The experimental results indicated that the capacitance change was linearly correlated with the cell concentration of E. coli O157:H7. The immunosensor was able to discriminate between cellular concentrations of 10(2)-10(5) cfu mL(-1) and has applications in detecting pathogens in food samples. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were also employed to characterize the stepwise assembly of the immunosensor.",

Methods Microglia were obtained from cerebral cortexes of neonatal Sprague Dawley rats. Microglia were separated,purificated,cultured and activated. ELISA was used to detect the level of TNF-α,IL-1β in supernate fluid before and after induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or influenced by progesterone. Results LPS strongly induced the expression of TNF-α,IL-1β in microglia from cerebral cortexes. Progesterone inhibited the expression of TNF-α,IL-1β.

        "abstract": "AIM:To demonstrate the presence of protease-activated receptor-1(PAR-1) and PAR-2 in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus(DMNV),and to elucidate the cellular mechanisms that are triggered upon receptor activation in the rat with inflammatory bowel disease.METHODS:Twenty rats were used to produce the animal model of inflammatory bowel disease.The tissues of DMNV were collected from these animals for measuring PAR-1 and PAR-2.By using the Fura-2-AM,the concentration of intracellular calcium in primary cultured DMNV cells from newborn rats was observed in the presence of PAR-1 or PAR-2.RESULTS:Thrombin and PAR-1 agonist peptide(PARP-1) activated PAR-1 with a maximum change in intracellular calcium concentration Δ[Ca2+]i.Trypsin and PAR-2 agonist peptide(PARP-2) activated PAR-2 with a maximum Δ[Ca2+]i.Inhibition of phospholipase C(PLC) by 1 μmol/L U73312 decreased Δ[Ca2+]i induced by PAR-1 activation.The PAR-2-mediated Δ[Ca2+]i decreased when PLC was inhibited.Blockade of IP3 receptor by 2APB decreased the Δ[Ca2+]i due to PAR-1 and PAR-2 activation.CONCLUSION:Our results indicate that PAR-1 and PAR-2 are present in the DMNV neurons,and their activation leads to increases in intracellular calcium via signal transduction mechanism that involves activation of phospholipase C and the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.",

Fixed and random effects models were used.Six RCTs enrolling 1033 participants (LS group:577 cases, OS group:456 cases)were included in the meta-analysis. Number of lymph node harvested was similar(WMD=-0.38, 95%CI:-1.35-0.58, P=0.43). LS had a slightly higher circumference resection margin(CRM) positive rate with no statistical significance[7.94% vs. 5.37%; risk ratio(RR)=1.13; 95%CI:0.69-1.85, P=0.63]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in local recurrence (RR=0.55; 95%CI:0.22-1.40, P=0.21). The 3-year overall survival [Hazard ratio(HR)=0.76; 95%CI:0.54-1.07, P=0.11] and 3-year disease-free survival(HR=1.16; 95%CI:0.61-2.20, P=0.64) were not significantly different between the two groups.Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery of rectal carcinoma offers similar oncological clearance and long-term oncological outcomes.",

        "abstract": "To determine the effects of dietary Fe concentration on Mn bioavailability in rats fed inorganic or organic Mn sources, fifty-four 22-d-old male rats were randomly assigned and fed a basal diet (2·63 mg Fe/kg) supplemented with 0 (low Fe (L-Fe)), 35 (adequate Fe (A-Fe)) or 175 (high Fe (H-Fe)) mg Fe/kg with 10 mg Mn/kg from MnSO4 or Mn-lysine chelate (MnLys). Tissues were harvested after 21 d of feeding. Serum Mn was greater (Pu003c0·05) in MnLys rats than in MnSO4 rats, and in L-Fe rats than in A-Fe or H-Fe rats. Duodenal divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) mRNA was lower (Pu003c0·05) in H-Fe rats than in A-Fe rats for the MnSO4 treatment; however, no significant difference was observed between them for MnLys. Liver DMT1 mRNA abundance was greater (Pu003c0·05) in MnSO4 than in the MnLys group for H-Fe rats. The DMT1 protein in duodenum and liver and ferroportin 1 (FPN1) protein in liver was greater (Pu003c0·05) in the MnSO4 group than in the MnLys group, and in L-Fe rats than in H-Fe rats. Duodenal FPN1 protein was greater (Pu003c0·05) in L-Fe rats than in A-Fe rats for the MnLys treatment, but it was not different between them for the MnSO4 treatment. Results suggest that MnLys increased serum Mn concentration as compared with MnSO4 in rats irrespective of dietary Fe concentration, which was not because of the difference in DMT1 and FPN1 expression in the intestine and liver.",

        "abstract": "Microencapsulated n-octadecane with melamine–formaldehyde resin (MF) shell was synthesized by in situ polymerization. Ammonium chloride was used\n to reduce the residual formaldehyde content of microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) caused by the inherent\n characteristics of MF. Moreover, microPCMs were heat-treated at 160 �C for 30 min. The surface morphology of the microPCMs\n fabricated at various microencapsulation periods was examined, and the shell thickness was measured. The effects of heat treatment\n on the surface morphology, residual formaldehyde content, phase change properties, and thermal stability of the microcapsules\n were systematically investigated. The globular surface of microcapsules fabricated at microencapsulation period of 120 min\n was smooth and compact with an average diameter about 2.2 μm, and the shell thickness was ranged from 30 to 70 nm. The thermal\n stability of heat-treated microcapsules enhanced significantly as microencapsulation period increased; in addition, the residual\n formaldehyde content of microcapsules decreased from 125 � 1 mg/kg to 19 � 1 mg/kg.",

In addition, considering the dynamic character of group members, this protocol adopts efficient group key management strategies to ensure the forward and backward secrecy of the group communications. Through simulation experiment and analysis, it is proved that this protocol can ensure the security of multicast tree establishment, and achieve satisfactory blocking probability and key update delay.",

As wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks have emerged as a promising candidate for future networks with large bandwidth, supporting efficient multicast in WDM networks becomes eminent. Different from the IP layer, the cost of multicast at the WDM layer involves not only bandwidth (wavelength) cost but also wavelength conversion cost. In this paper, we study the multicast problem in WDM networks supporting wavelength conversion. In particular, we address the problem of minimizing cost of wavelength conversion in a multicast tree with upper bound on the number of conversions from source to destinations. An efficient optimal wavelength assignment algorithm is presented",

Given a fixed amount of bandwidth for broadcasting and patching, there is no prior work on determining the minimum WPD, let alone guaranteeing it. In this work, we propose novel schemes that leverage the unique properties of a TDM-based Passive Optical Network (PON) by performing rebroadcasting and patching at its Optical Network Unit (ONUs). For a given bandwidth available for VoD services in the PON, we derive the minimum worst-case playback delay (WPD), and also design optimal patch scheduling algorithm as well as ONU rebroadcast and patching channel assignment to guarantee such minimum WPD. Numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed schemes over the existing ones in terms of both worst-case and average performance.",

DATA SYNTHESIS: Due to the similar biocompatibility with the natural bone inorganic structure, and the bone inductivity, nanometer HAP plays a crucial role in the bone defect repair. Nanometer characteristic can reduce micro-leakage following the root canal filling, and the nanometer HAP compounded with some bacteriostasis/antibiosis preparations, may obtain good effect in treatment of pulposis and periapical disease. CONCLUSION: The HAP nanometer compound conforms the cell toxicity requirement for biological materials, with the absence of toxicity (according to the toxicity dosage graduation), pyrogenicity and skin stimulation, also with the presence of good biocompatibility, bone inductivity, cell adherence and bacteriostasis/antibiosis properties, thus it hopefully displays greater effectiveness in the stomatology basic research and the clinical application.",

        "abstract": "AIM:The aim of the present study was to detect the methylation status of multiple genes(Syk,CDH1 and TIMP-3)in colorectal cancer(CRC)tissues,to investigate the roles in the pathogenesis of CRC,to investigate whether methylation of multiple genes was associated with recurrence and metastasis of CRC,and to evaluate its ability to predict the prognosis of CRC.METHODS:Nested methylation-specific PCR(n-MSP)were used to detect methylation status of spleen tyrosine kinase(Syk)from 120 CRC tissues and the methylation status of CDH1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3(TIMP-3)from 100 CRC tissues.RESULTS:We found that methylation in one or more genes,co-methylation in two genes and three genes were detected in 74%,21%,and 8% of CRC tissues.No significant correlation between three genes co-methylation and lymph node metastasis(χ2=0.725,P>0.05)was observed.The methylation of CDH1 gene,but not Syk or TIMP-3 gene,was significantly related with liver and lung metastasis of CRC(χ2=6.938,P<0.01).The methylation of Syk or TIMP-3,and co-methylation of CDH1 and TIMP-3 were risk factors in the prognosis of colorectal cancer after surgical treatment,and three genes co-methylation was not a risk factor.CONCLUSION:Our results indicate that methylation of multiple genes exists in CRC tissues.The methylation of multiple genes is not a necessary factor in the pathogenesis,metastasis and recurrence of CRC,and also it is not a necessary prognostic factor in CRC.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore Syk(L) and Syk(S) expression, subcellular localization in breast cancer cells and their effects on breast cancer cells invasion. Methods Western blot was used to examine 2 Syk isoform's expression in breast cancer cells. Cytosolic and nuclear fractionation and plasmids mutation techniques were used to examine the two Syk isoforms subcellular localization in the cells and the mechanisms of Syk(L) translocalization to the nuclears. The effects of the two Syk isoforms and Syk(L) mutants, whose basic amino acids on DEL domain were mutated into non basic amino acids, on breast cancer cells invasion were explored by chemoinvasion assay. Results Both Syk( L) and Syk (S) were expressed in 4 out of six breast cancer cell lines. The expression of Syk ( L) in breast cancer cells inhibited cells invasion ability significantly. In breast cancer cell line MB468 expressing both Syk(L) and Syk( S) and in MB435 in which stable cells express either Syk(L) or Syk(S) ,only Syk(L) ,which is with large moleeuar weight, was able to translocate into nuclears from cytoplasm. When the basic amino acids in the DEL domain of Syk(L) were mutated into non basic amino acids, Syk(L) was deprived of the ability to translocate into the nuclears and the ability to suppress cell invasion. Conclusions The basic amino acids on DEL domain of Syk(L) has nuclear localization signal function. Syk(L) invasion suppression activity in breast cancer cells is associated with its nuclear translocation. Syk(L) tumor suppression function is determined by its nuclear protein functions.",

        "abstract": "The Huachanggou gold deposit of Shaanxi Province occurs in the submarine basic volcanic effusive spillite. Based on field geological work in the Huachanggou gold deposit, this paper analyzes trace elements of the samples in the north ore zone by such means as geo -mathematic analysis and calculation of the primary halo zoning. The result shows that the front halo elements are Sb, As, Cu, Hg, the near-ore halo elements are Au, Ag, Bi, Pb, W, and the rear halo elements are Ni, Co, Mn, Mo, Zn, Cd. The primary halo axial zoning sequence from the top to the deep part of the north ore zone is Hg-Bi-Mo-Au-Ag-As-Cu-Pb-Co-W- Mn-Sb-Ni- Zn -Cd. According to the characteristics of threshold halo zoning, the ideal zoning model of the primary superimposed halos is built. Three ore bodies (A, B and C) appear in the area form the 950m level down to the 830m level. The tail of ore body A is stacked on the top of ore body B, while ore body C is far away from ore body B. The tail of the ore body C appears at the 830m level, and the its downward extension is not large.",

To achieve high performance, it has been proposed to use TCAMs to implement search engines in hardware. In this paper, the state- of-art TCAM-based MSMB-LPT scheme is used as an example to show how to introduce pipelining into TCAM-based search by presenting pipelined scheme P-MSMB-LPT. It is shown that P-MSMB-LPT eliminates the unnecessary hazard that exists in the MSMB-LPT scheme, and achieves near-optimal speedup with almost no additional hardware overhead.",

        "abstract": "Sex determination in papaya is controlled by a recently evolved XY chromosome pair, with two slightly different Y chromosomes controlling the development of males (Y) and hermaphrodites (Y h). To study the events of early sex chromosome evolution, we sequenced the hermaphrodite-specific region of the Y h chromosome (HSY) and its X counterpart, yielding an 8.1-megabase (Mb) HSY pseudomolecule, and a 3.5-Mb sequence for the corresponding X region. The HSY is larger than the X region, mostly due to retrotransposon insertions. The papaya HSY differs from the X region by two large-scale inversions, the first of which likely caused the recombination suppression between the X and Y h chromosomes, followed by numerous additional chromosomal rearrangements. Altogether, including the X and/or HSY regions, 124 transcription units were annotated, including 50 functional pairs present in both the X and HSY. Ten HSY genes had functional homologs elsewhere in the papaya autosomal regions, suggesting movement of genes onto the HSY, whereas the X region had none. Sequence divergence between 70 transcripts shared by the X and HSY revealed two evolutionary strata in the X chromosome, corresponding to the two inversions on the HSY, the older of which evolved about 7.0 million years ago. Gene content differences between the HSY and X are greatest in the older stratum, whereas the gene content and order of the collinear regions are identical. Our findings support theoretical models of early sex chromosome evolution.",

During the experiment, an external electrical voltage is applied through two platinum electrodes dipped in the beakers. A gas bubble forms inside the capillary when the applied voltage is higher than 1000 V. Since the beakers are tilted slightly, after generation, the bubble moves slowly to the uphill outlet of the capillary due to buoyancy. When the bubble reaches the end of the capillary, it cracks and a bright discharge is ignited. The emission spectra of the discharge plasma are related to the metal ions dissolved in the solution and thus can be used for metal ion detection. An application of the system to measurement of water hardness is shown.",

However, their applications are mainly limited by the compactness and thermal stability of the traditional polyurea shell microcapsules. To increase the thermal compactness and thermal stability of PCM microcapsules, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was employed to form polymer/SiO₂ composite shells to enhance the mechanical performance of polyurea and polyurethane microcapsule via interfacial polymerization and in situ polymerization. The morphology and chemical components of the microcapsules were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, respectively. The thermal properties of the microcapsules were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravity analysis (TGA). The results showed the smoothness and compactness of both polyurea⁻SiO₂ and polyurethane⁻SiO₂ microcapsules enhanced slightly, when compared with that without TEOS addition. Moreover, the SiO₂ composite shell had good effect on thermal compactness, as the weight loss rate of polyurea⁻SiO₂ microcapsules and polyurethane⁻SiO₂ microcapsules decreased 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The ability to discover services offered in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) is the major prerequisite for effectively utilizing these services. Caching service advertisements is an essential component in service discovery protocols for MANETs. To fully utilize the advantage of the cached service advertisements, the cached service description can be advertised with the local service description in a vicinity, which however will increase packet size. To reduce packet size, a better solution is to representing the cached service advertisements with a meta service description. In this paper, we introduce a fine-grained group-based meta service description scheme and propose an efficient service discovery protocol: Meta Service Description Assisted Service Discovery Protocol (MSDASDP) for MANETs, where the number of forwarding nodes of request packets is minimized with the help of the fine-grained meta service description. Simulation results both show that MSDASDP is an effective, efficient, and prompt service discovery protocol for MANETs",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) patients aged 75 years and older undergoing potentially curative surgery.A total of 2,482 CRC patients at TNM stage I-III undergoing surgical treatment between 1995 and 2005 were evaluated, and patients were divided into a younger (<75 years old) and an elderly (≥75 years) group.There were 2,482 CRC patients in this study, of which 2,194 (88.4 %) patients were in the younger group (mean age 57 years) and 288 (11.6 %) were in the elderly group (mean age 79 years). Significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, tumor location, co-morbidities, emergency procedures, use of chemotherapy, proportion admitted to the ICU, length of ICU stay, causes of death, T/N stage and postoperative recurrence. The postoperative mortality increased from 4.8 % in the younger group to 8.3 % in the older group (p = 0.011). Although significant differences were found in the overall 5-year survival (73 vs. 56 %, p < 0.0001) and disease-free 5-year survival (68 vs. 54 %, p < 0.0001) between the two groups, the cancer-specific 5-year survival was similar (88 vs. 85 %, p = 0.089) in both groups.Although elderly CRC patients have unique clinicopathological features, a higher postoperative mortality and a worse overall and disease-free survival compared with younger patients, the cancer-specific survival at five years is similar between elderly and younger patients. Elderly patients benefit from radical surgery and have a good postoperative oncological outcome, irrespective of their age.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This article presents a numerical study on the rotating detonation engine (RDE). The simulation explores the phenomenon of the reinitiation of detonations in the RDE with a cylindrical combustion chamber. The process is modelled by the three-dimensional reactive Euler equations with an Arrhenius form of the reaction rate for the premixed stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture. The detonation flow goes through three stages: initiation, quenching, and spontaneous reinitiation. The detonation fronts collide with each other and also have frequent collisions with the outer wall after initiation. While there is a possibility of generating new detonation fronts from the explosion, it is also likely that the explosion will burn out the surrounding reactive mixtures and snuff out the detonation waves. The simulation shows that a strong collision between two detonation wave fronts extinguishes the detonation flow and consequently renders the engine inoperative for an extended period until a spontaneous reinitiation occurs in the flow. The reinitiation is found to be triggered by a rapid and sharp increase of pressure near the chamber wall.",

This involves high-temperature ion diffusion, then step annealing. These particles exhibit a high magnetic thermal stability and low-temperature coefficient of coercivity. The latter demonstrates a striking contrast to the ordinary cobalt-body-doped ��-Fe2O3 particles. The induced uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1 of the particles were determined by torque measurements. The novel properties of these particles are mainly due to the high uniaxial anisotropy, resulting from the anisotropic arrangements of cobalt ions. With the above characteristics and low Co content, these acicular particles can be one of the promising candidates for particulate high-density magnetic recording materials.",

        "abstract": "To protect user privacy in wireless mesh networks (WMNs), it is important to address two major challenges, namely: flow untraceability and movement untraceability, which prevent malicious attackers from deducing the flow paths and the movement tracks of mobile devices. For these two privacy requirements, most existing approaches rely on encrypting the whole packet, appending random padding, and applying random delay for each message at every intermediate node, resulting in significant computational and communication overheads. Recently, linear network coding (LNC) has been introduced as an alternative but the global encoding vectors (GEVs) of coded messages have to be encrypted so as to conceal the relationships between the incoming and outgoing messages. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LNC to ensure the flow untraceability and movement untraceability. Specifically, we first determine the necessary and sufficient condition, with which the two privacy requirements can be achieved without encrypting either GEVs or message contents. We then design a deterministic untraceable LNC (ULNC) scheme to provide flow untraceability and movement untraceability when the sufficient and necessary condition is satisfied. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed ULNC scheme against traffic analysis attacks in WMNs.",

        "abstract": "Organic manganese (Mn) sources can replace inorganic Mn as dietary Mn supplements in poultry. To compare the uptake of Mn from the Mn-lysine complex (MnLys) and MnSO, we first established the primary chicken intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) model and used it to determine Mn uptake. The MnLys increased the uptake of Mn compared to MnSO. The uptake of Mn decreased in the IECs with Fe addition in the medium regardless of the Mn sources. The MnLys decreased the Mn efflux transporter ferroportin 1 (FPN1) mRNA level but did not influence the Mn influx transporter divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA expression when compared to MnSO. The results above indicated that the increase of Mn accumulation for MnLys at least partly was due to the decrease of Mn efflux by reduced FPN1 expression. The addition of -ethylmaleimide, an L-lysine transport system y inhibitor, decreased the uptake of Mn from MnLys but did not affect the uptake of Mn from MnSO. The cycloheximide, as an L-lysine transport system b activator, increased the uptake of Mn from MnLys, whereas they did not influence the uptake of Mn from MnSO. The MnLys increased the system y members cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) 1 and CAT2, and system b components rBAT and bAT mRNA expression when compared to MnSO. These results suggested that the uptake of MnLys complex might be transported by CAT1/2 and system b, which was different from the ionized Mn uptake pathway. In conclusion, the uptake of Mn from MnLys complex not only might be uptake through the ionized Mn pathway, but also appeared to be transported through the CAT1/2 and system b in primary chicken IECs.",

        "abstract": "Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) are an important technical means to explore the ocean realm. However, most UASNs rely on hardware infrastructures with poor flexibility and versatility. The systems typically deploy in a redundant manner, which not only leads to waste but also causes serious signal interference due to multiple noises in designated underwater regions. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel network paradigm, which provides an innovative approach to improve flexibility and reduce development risks greatly. Although SDN and UASNs are hot topics, there are currently few studies built on both. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on the advances in software-defined UASNs. First, we briefly present the background, and then we review the progress of the Software-Defined Radio (SDR), Cognitive Radio (CR), and SDN. Next, we introduce the current issues and potential research areas. Finally, we conclude the paper and present discussions. Based on this work, we hope to inspire more active studies and take a further step on software-defined UASNs with high performances.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the hybrid Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access network integrating passive optical networks (PONs) and wireless mesh networks (WMNs) has been proposed to provide the high bandwidth, low cost and ubiquitous Internet access. Typically, for the PON subnetwork of FiWi networks, a hybrid TDM/WDM architecture has been applied due to its cost efficiency and the high bandwidth provided by multiple wavelengths carried in the optical trunk. In such hybrid TDM/WDM FiWi networks, we aim to maximize the overall network throughput and meanwhile to find an appropriate wavelength assignment scheme of ONUs to achieve the approximate maximal throughput with the minimum number of wavelengths to be used. In this paper, we first obtain the maximal achievable throughput at ONUs and then get the minimal number of wavelength to be used. Given the number of wavelengths, we first use LP-based formulations to estimate the expected traffic load range at each ONU and then proposed the Approximate Wavelength Assignment(AWA) algorithm to calculate the appropriate traffic load at each ONU and obtain the proper wavelength assignment scheme of ONUs. We also verify the efficiency of the wavelength assignment scheme obtained through AWA algorithm. Simulation results strongly validate our algorithm.",

We sequenced the genome of Ananas comosus var. bracteatus CB5 and assembled 513 Mb into 25 chromosomes with 29,412 genes. Comparison of the genomes of CB5, F153 and MD2 elucidated the genomic basis of fiber production, color formation, sugar accumulation and fruit maturation. We also resequenced 89 Ananas genomes. Cultivars 'Smooth Cayenne' and 'Queen' exhibited ancient and recent admixture, while 'Singapore Spanish' supported a one-step operation of domestication. We identified 25 selective sweeps, including a strong sweep containing a pair of tandemly duplicated bromelain inhibitors. Four candidate genes for self-incompatibility were linked in F153, but were not functional in self-compatible CB5. Our findings support the coexistence of sexual recombination and a one-step operation in the domestication of clonally propagated crops. This work guides the exploration of sexual and asexual domestication trajectories in other clonally propagated crops.",

        "title": "Effects of Values on the PTSD Symptoms of Deliberate Truama Victims",
        "abstract": "What are the causes of PTSD(Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) One explanation is that a traumatic event may have shattered our deeply held and probably unexamined assumptions and beliefs about the world and ourselves. But many researches suggest that not all people who suffer from the same traumatic event suffer from PTSD, and that a negative social environment is a better indicator of PTSD symptomatology than a lack of positive support. The aim of the present study is to investigate how values impact PTSD symptoms of the deliberate trauma victims and, particularly, to identity whether a negative social environment mediates the influence of value to PTSD symptoms. One hundred and three adults who came from hospitals and police stations in different regions in China responded to the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Acknowledgement as a Victim Scale, and Schwartz Value Survey-Portrait Version. We conducted correlation analyses, ANOVA analyses, multiple regression and path analyses. The results showed that 3 PTSD symptoms of the deliberate trauma victims manifested significant differences, with the intrusion symptom level being the highest, avoidance the second, and the hyper arousal symptom the lowest. Among different negative exterior conditions, disproval of partner and acquaintance had more apparent effects than family disapproval and social cognition. To a degree, the values could forecast 3 PTSD symptoms, and achievement was the best indicator of PTSD symptomatology of the deliberate trauma victims. Finally, the introversive values could impact on the intrusion symptom by some factors which reflected exterior criterions such as social cognition. According to the results, we can conclude that the effects of values on PTSD symptoms of the deliberate trauma victims depend on value types and other factors which reflect exterior criterions such as social cognition. The negative influence of social disapproval on avoidance symptom of the introversive-value deliberate trauma victims suggests that we should not only think of social supporting, but also attach importance to value types during the intervention for deliberate trauma victims.",

        "abstract": "Interference modeling is crucial for the performance of numerous WSN protocols such as congestion control, link/channel scheduling, and reliable routing. In particular, understanding and mitigating interference becomes increasingly important for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) as they are being deployed for many data-intensive applications such as structural health monitoring. However, previous works have widely adopted simplistic interference models that fail to capture the wireless realities such as probabilistic packet reception performance. Recent studies suggested that the physical interference model (i.e., PRR-SINR model) is significantly more accurate than existing interference models. However, existing approaches to physical interference modeling exclusively rely on the use of active measurement packets, which imposes prohibitively high overhead to bandwidth-limited WSNs. In this paper, we propose the passive interference measurement (PIM) approach to tackle the complexity of accurate physical interference characterization. PIM exploits the spatiotemporal diversity of data traffic for radio performance profiling and only needs to gather a small amount of statistics about the network. We evaluate the efficiency of PIM through extensive experiments on both a 13-node and a 40-node testbeds of TelosB motes. Our results show that PIM can achieve high accuracy of PRR-SINR modeling with significantly lower overhead compared with the active measurement approach.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive radio network (CRN) is an emerging technology that can increase the utilization of spectrum underutilized by primary users (PUs). In the literature, most exiting investigations on CRNs have focused on how secondary users (SUs) can coexist harmlessly with the PUs. Despite the importance of such a coexistence issue, it is also crucial to investigate the coexistence of SUs because (i) the PUs usually rarely use the licensed spectrum and (ii) the advantages of CRN will significantly increase the number of SUs in the future. To address this challenging issue, we propose, in this paper, an optimal randomized spectrum access scheme, whose main ideas include the following: (i) an SU shares its sensing results with neighboring SUs and (ii) with the regional sensing results, an SU will access available channels with a non-uniform probability distribution. We first formulate a multichannel optimal randomized multiple access (MC-ORMA) problem that aims to maximize the throughput of the CRN; we then develop efficient distributed algorithms to solve the MC-ORMA problem; we derive the closed-form value of collision probability for each SU; and finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments and compare our theoretical analysis with simulation results to demonstrate the advantages of our scheme.

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is often necessary to update the software running on sensors, which requires reliable dissemination of large data objects to each sensor with energy efficiency. During data dissemination, due to sleep scheduling designed for energy efficiency, some sensors may not receive some packets at some time slots. In the meantime, due to the unreliability of wireless communication, a sensor may not successfully receive a packet even when it is in the active mode. Thus, retransmission of such packets to those sensors is necessary, which consumes more energy and increases the delay of data dissemination cycle. In this paper, we propose a network coding-based approach in data dissemination such that data dissemination can be accomplished at the earliest time. Thus, less energy is consumed and the delay can be decreased. The impact of packet loss probability and the sleep probability of sensors on the network coding gain is analyzed. A threshold is also given to decide whether the current sleep scheduling is effective on energy saving in data dissemination process or not. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed work.",

        "abstract": "An all-optical analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on the nonlinear effect in a silicon waveguide is a promising candidate for overcoming the limitation of electronic devices and is suitable for photonic integration. In this paper, a lumped time-delay compensation scheme with 2-bit quantization resolution is proposed. A strip silicon waveguide is designed and used to compensate for the entire time-delays of the optical pulses after a soliton self-frequency shift (SSFS) module within a wavelength range of 1550 nm–1580 nm. A dispersion coefficient as high as –19800 ps/(kmnm) with ±0.5 ps/(kmnm) variation is predicted for the strip waveguide. The simulation results show that the maximum supportable sampling rate (MSSR) is 50.45 GSa/s with full width at half maximum (FWHM) variation less than 2.52 ps, along with the 2-bit effective-number-of-bit and Gray code output.",

        "abstract": "The influence of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) supplementation on growth performance, carcass traits, intestinal development, and lipid metabolism was assessed in 600 one-day-old male meat ducks (Cherry Valley ducks) from 1 to 35 d of age. Diets were supplemented with 0, 200, 500, 800 and 1,500 mg/kg NCC during both the starter (1-14 d) and grower (15-35 d) phases. Each dietary treatment consisted of 8 replicate cages of 15 birds. Supplementation of NCC was associated with dose dependent increases in BW gain and feed intake ( < 0.01) during 1-14 d of age and in BW at 35 d of age. As NCC content increased, the percentage of breast meat weight ( < 0.05) and leg (with bone) weight ( < 0.05) linearly increased, while the percentage of abdominal fat weight ( < 0.01) linearly decreased in ducks at 35 d of age. Supplementation of NCC resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the weight ( < 0.05) and density ( < 0.01) of the cecum. The percentage of total hepatic lipid content ( < 0.01) at 14 d of age and serum triglyceride (TG) concentration ( = 0.052) at 35 d of age linearly decreased with increasing of dietary NCC addition. In conclusion, inclusion of 1,500 mg/kg NCC in feed resulted in the greatest improvements in duck performance, intestinal development and lipid deposition.",

        "abstract": "Parathion is one of the most poisonous pesticides in the world. An immunosensor system was developed for the rapid and sensitive determination of pesticides, using the insecticide parathion as a model analyte. The immunosensor, based on the biocomposites of ferrofluids loaded with anti-parathion antibodies for detection ofparathion pesticide in aqueous solutions was described. Ferrofluids-antibody conjugates (FACs) were prepared by immobilizing biotinylated polyclonal anti-parathion (anti-PA) antibodies onto streptavidin ferrofluid, which were used to separate and concentrate target parathion from samples. After immunomagnetic separation, the test solution containing magnetic conjugates were resuspended in washing solution and injected into microfluidic chips. Thus, impedance was observed and the faradaic impedance spectra at the transducer were presented to reflect this specific antibody-antigen binding. Detection ofparathion at a concentration of 0.01 μg/mL was achieved with this system. The time required for detection was thirty minutes. Antibody regeneration was also discussed in this study. The biosensor indicated that it could be used as a pre-scanning method in pesticide determination for the analysis of environmental, agricultural and pharmaceutical samples due to its rapidity, sensitivity and low cost.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on multihop range-free localization in anisotropic wireless sensor networks. In anisotropic networks, geometric distance between a pair of sensor nodes is not always proportional to their hop count distance, which undermines the assumption of many existing range-free localization algorithms. To tolerate network anisotropy, we propose a pattern-driven localization scheme, which is inspired by the observation that in an anisotropic network the hop count field propagated from an anchor exhibits multiple patterns, under the interference of multiple anisotropic factors. Our localization scheme therefore for different patterns adopts different anchor-sensor distance estimation algorithms. The average anchor-sensor distance estimation accuracy of our scheme, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, is improved to be better than 0.4r when the average sensor density is above eight, and the sensor localization accuracy thus is approximately better than 0.5r. This localization accuracy can satisfy the needs of many location-dependent protocols and applications, including geographical routing and tracking. Compared with previous localization algorithms that declares to tolerate network anisotropy, our localization scheme excels in 1) higher accuracy stemming from its ability to tolerate multiple anisotropic factors, including the existence of obstacles, sparse and nonuniform sensor distribution, irregular radio propagation pattern, and anisotropic terrain condition, 2) localization accuracy guaranteed by theoretical analysis, rather than merely by simulations, and 3) a distributed solution with less communication overhead and enhanced robustness to different network topologies.",

End points included 5-year overall survival, 5-year disease-free survival, recurrence, and mortality.A significant improvement in 5-year overall survival was associated with surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-0.91) and for stage II rectal cancer (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86). The 5-year disease-free survival also favored the group of surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98) and for stage II rectal cancer (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51).

The Valtrac BAR from USA was employed in the control group while the experimental group used domestic BAR. The operative performance of the BARs, as well as the patients vital signs and bowel function, complications, fragmentation status of the rings were compared between two groups.No significant difference was found between two groups in the operative performance, the fragmentation status of the BARs, the temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and bowel function (P>0.05).The domestic BAR possesses similar safety and efficacy with the Valtrac BAR in intestinal anastomosis.",

Four scenarios were assumed and analyzed. Results of the base case scenario showed that TN concentration of the Miyun Reservoir had highly exceeded the environmental quality standard for surface water, and TP was relatively better. Furthermore, there were many regions that chlorophyll-a concentration exceeded 10 microg/L in the reservoir, and centralized in the reservoir area of Chaohe River. Scenario 1, 2 and 3 investigated effects of different pollution control measures on the water quality of the reservoir. Results showed that the control of nutrient input loads could improve the water quality greatly, especially control of TP loadings would limit algae growth effectively, and regions that chlorophyll-a concentration exceeded 10 microg/L even disappeared. The results indicated that some control measures, such as changing farming style, part treatment on stockbreeding pollution and reducing point source pollutant loadings were very effective and essential to decrease the eutrophic level of the reservoir.",

As a commonly used global optimization method, genetic algorithm (GA) has very simple structure, the key related to whether a practical issue can be solved using GA or not is algorithm design and selection of the control parameters. Based on the feature of parameter optimization of water quality model, orthogonal test method was proposed for reviewing effects of different control parameters of GA on the performance of water quality parameter optimization. The results indicate that orthogonal method could identify key factors, and also provide possible optimized experiment plan.

The mapped WENO scheme achieves optimal order near critical points but needs too much CPU costs, since the division mapping spends much CPU time. In consideration of the unnecessary of monotonicity, we construct a new polynomial mapping. The new scheme also achieves optimal order near critical points but saves considerable CPU time.

However, such distributed access cannot be fully supported and exploited by existing routing protocols in a large-scale WSN. In this paper, we will address this challenging issue and propose a distributed geographic K-anycast routing (GKAR) protocol for WSNs, which can efficiently route data from a source sensor to any K destinations (e.g., storage nodes or sinks). To guarantee K-delivery, an iterative approach is adopted in GKAR where in each round, GKAR will determine not only the next hops at each node, but also a set of potential destinations for every next hop node to reach. Efficient algorithms are designed to determine the selection of the next hops and destination set division at each intermediate node. We analyze the complexity of GKAR in each round and we also theoretically analyze the expected number of rounds required to guarantee K-delivery. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the GKAP scheme in reducing the total duration and the communication overhead for finding K destinations, by comparing with the existing schemes, e.g., K 1-anycast [10].",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Foodborne diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria have increasingly become a major public health issue worldwide. Rapid, simple, and accurate detection methods are urgently needed for in-field screening of bacterial pathogens. In our previous work, rapid detection methodologies have been established based on fluorescent nanobiosensors for simultaneous separation and detection of multiple foodborne pathogenic bacteria. In this research, a portable fluorescent biosensing system was designed and built and further assessed for in-field detection of three main types of bacterial pathogens that have been associated with the outbreaks of foodborne illness. Using the developed fluorescent nanobiosensor coupled with nanobead-based immunomagnetic separation, we conducted blind tests with the portable device to simultaneously detect  E. coli  O157:H7,  L. monocytogenes , and  S.  Typhimurium in different food products in three cities selected from three big agricultural provinces in China. Specificity tests showed low interference of this multiplex biosensor from non-targets in food samples. The detection could be done from sampling to results within 60 min. Limits of detections of this method for  E. coli  O157:H7,  L. monocytogenes , and  S.  Typhimurium were determined to be 10 2 , 10 3 , and 10 3  CFU/mL in lettuce, shrimp, and ground beef, respectively. Recovery tests were also investigated and this method was evaluated to be accurate comparing with the gold standard culturing method. Therefore, it is feasible for this portable fluorescence biosensing system to be used in rapid and in-field screening of multiple foodborne pathogenic bacteria in foods, such as vegetables, livestock meat, and sea food. And together with fluorescent nanobiosensors, it provides a promising alternative tool to traditional culturing method, or even conventional ELISA and PCR based methods.",

There were 415 lymph nodes retrieved from the mesorectum in the group without neoadjuvant therapy including 169 metastatic lymph nodes and 59 micro-metastatic lymph nodes. Among these nodes, there were 12 rectal cancer cases with lymph nodes and 4 cases with micro-metastatic lymph nodes. The proportions of metastatic lymph nodes in outer zone between the two groups were 21.5% and 29.0%, and those in pre-zone were 17.6% and 17.2% respectively. The ratio of metastatic lymph nodes in ischiorectal fossa between the two groups were 25.0% vs. 22.2% respectively.

        "abstract": "A major disruption may affect many network components and significantly lower the capacity of a network measured in terms of the maximum total flow among a set of source-destination pairs. Since only a subset of the failed components may be repaired at a time due to e.g., limited availability of repair resources, the network capacity can only be progressively increased over time by following a recovery process that involves multiple recovery stages. Different recovery processes will restore the failed components in different orders, and accordingly, result in different amount of network capacity increase after each stage. This paper aims to investigate how to optimally recover the network capacity progressively, or in other words, to determine the optimal recovery process, subject to limited available repair resources. We formulate the optimization problem, analyze its computational complexity, devise solution schemes, and conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the algorithms. The concept of progressive network recovery proposed in this paper represents a paradigm-shift in the field of resilient and survivable networking to handle large-scale failures, and will motivate a rich body of research in network design and other applications.",

        "abstract": "Zonulin is a newly discovered protein that has an important role in the regulation of intestinal permeability. Our previous study showed that probiotics can decrease the rate of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy for colorectal cancer.The objective was to determine the effects of the perioperative administration of probiotics on serum zonulin concentrations and the subsequent effect on postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.A total of 150 patients with colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned to the control group (n = 75), which received placebo, or the probiotics group (n = 75). Both the probiotics and placebo were given orally for 6 d preoperatively and 10 d postoperatively. Outcomes were measured by assessing bacterial translocation, postoperative intestinal permeability, serum zonulin concentrations, duration of postoperative pyrexia, and cumulative duration of antibiotic therapy. The postoperative infection rate, the positive rate of blood microbial DNA, and the incidence of postoperative infectious complications-including septicemia, central line infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and diarrhea-were also assessed.The infection rate was lower in the probiotics group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Probiotics decreased the serum zonulin concentration (P < 0.001), duration of postoperative pyrexia, duration of antibiotic therapy, and rate of postoperative infectious complications (all P < 0.05). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway was inhibited by probiotics.Perioperative probiotic treatment can reduce the rate of postoperative septicemia and is associated with reduced serum zonulin concentrations in patients undergoing colectomy. We propose a clinical regulatory model that might explain this association. This trial was registered at http://www.chictr.org/en/ as ChiCTR-TRC-00000423.",

        "abstract": "Aim:To investigate the influence of progesterone(PROG) on the expression of MMP-9 and collagen Ⅳ after focal cerebral ischemia in rats.Methods:Rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model was used in this experiment. All rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operated group,ischemic group, vehicle (HBC)-treated group and PROG-treated group. Except for shamed operated group, 6 rats were killed in each group at 12,24,48 and 72 h post-occlusion, respectively. Immunohistochemistry technique was used to detect the expressions of MMP-9 and collagen Ⅳ.Results:The expression level of MMP-9 protein was higher in ischemic group and vehicle (HBC)-treated group than other two groups after stroke. There is significant difference between this four groups at all time points (P<0.05). In addition, this study also revealed that the expression of MMP-9 protein was obviously down-regulated when compared with the ischemic group and the HBC treated group at all time points (P<0.05). In the ischemic group the expression of collagen Ⅳ gradually decreased with time prolonging. There is significant difference between this four groups at all time points (P<0.05). In the progesterone treated group, the degradation of collagenⅣ protein was obviously reduced when compared with the ischemic group at all time points (P<0.05).Conclusion:Progesterone significantly reduced the expression of MMP-9 and block the down regulation of collagen Ⅳ, which is probably correlated with its effects in alleviating the degree of brain edema.",

        "abstract": "Multi-carrier code-division multiple access is an important technical means for high-performance underwater acoustic sensor networks. Nevertheless, severe multiple access interference is a huge challenge. As the core technology, multi-user detection is used to eliminate multiple access interference. The traditional optimal detection algorithms (e.g. maximum likelihood) have very high computational complexity, and the performances of suboptimal detection methods (i.e. zero forcing, minimum mean square error, etc.) are poor. Therefore, taking into account the characteristics of underwater acoustic sensor networks, it is of great significance to design multi-user detection algorithms for achieving a tradeoff between the detection performance and the computational complexity in multi-carrier code-division multiple access systems. In this article, we design a transmitter model of underwater multi-carrier code-division multiple access system and then implement a multi-user detection algorithm based on convex optimization, which is named convex optimization–based algorithm. Next, we conduct the detection performance and computational complexity comparisons of maximum likelihood, zero forcing, minimum mean square error, and convex optimization–based algorithm. The results show that the performance of convex optimization–based algorithm is close to that of maximum likelihood, and the complexity is close to that of zero forcing. Therefore, a tradeoff between the computational complexity and the detection performance is realized in convex optimization–based algorithm. It means that convex optimization–based algorithm is suitable for the multi-user detection in multi-carrier code-division multiple access systems of underwater acoustic sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "Located in Lueyang County of Shaanxi Province, the Huachanggou gold deposit is a small -sized deposit which is currently being mined. The gold deposit occurs in the slightly metamorphosed Middle and Lower Devonian strata composed of mafic volcanic rocks (spilite) and marine carbonate rocks. Gold mineralization is strictly controlled by a fault zone. There are mainly three types of ores : altered spilite gold ore, limestone quartz gold ore and quartz sandstone gold ore. These three types of ores occur respectively in the main ore belt, the north ore belt and the south ore belt, and the south-south ore belt. The S, C, Pb, H and O isotopic compositions show that there is a distinctive difference between the spilite ore and the limestone ore: the ore forming material source of the former ore came from deep source while that of the latter ore was derived from the upper crust. The Q-type cluster analysis of the trace elements and the REE distribution patterns show that the spilite ore and the limestone ore were closely related to the wall rocks. The geochemical characteristics clearly show that the ore-forming material sources came from the mafic volcanic rocks and the marine carbonate rocks. The data obtained also suggest that the ore-forming fluid was derived predominantly from an active meteoric groundwater system with the addition of small amounts of volcanic water.",

After a development of over 20 years, neoadjuvant synchronous chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment and cornerstone of neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer. However, radiotherapy does not really increase the overall survival and is associated with long-term impact on the functions of anus, sex, urinary system and fertility, so the application of simple neoadjuvant chemotherapy rises gradually and becomes a potentially better treatment option.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we will address the modeling and optimal design of linear network coding (LNC) for secure unicast with multiple streams between the same source and destination pair. The objectives include 1) satisfying the weakly secure requirements, 2) maximizing the transmission data rate, and 3) minimizing the size of the finite field. To fulfill the first two objectives, we formulate a secure unicast routing problem and prove that it is equivalent to a constrained link-disjoint path problem. Based on this fact, we develop an efficient algorithm that can find the optimal unicast topology in a polynomial amount of time. With the given topology, we investigate the design of both weakly secure deterministic LNC and weakly secure random LNC. In the designs of deterministic LNC and random LNC, we prove that the required size of the finite field decreases with the decrease of the number of intermediate nodes in the topology. Therefore, to meet the third objective, we formulate a problem to minimize the number of intermediate nodes. We prove that this problem is NP-Complete and develop an approximation algorithm to solve it. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

And the influences of four different buffers with the same pH (pH = 7.4), Tris-HCl, PBS, KH2PO4-NaOH and Na2 HPO4-C6H8O7, and five different chemical substances with the same mass concentration (10 g x L), NaCl, KCl, NaOH, MgCl2 and NaH2PO4 on ATP bioluminescence were compared. The results showed that Tris-HCl was a suitable buffer for dilution, since it could distinguish well between different concentrations and had the lowest background signals. And MgCl2 could intensify luminescence distinctly, while the other four chemical substances decreased luminescence, of which NaOH decreased luminescence most obviously. Moreover, ATP bioluminescence was correlated well with conventional culture methods (r = 0.96), and the detection limit was 10(3) cells x mL(-1).",

        "abstract": "The relation between the peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) reduction schemes and the transmission performance of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based visible light communication (VLC) system is experimentally investigated. The linear selective mapping (SLM) scheme and the nonlinear logarithmic companding scheme are optimized by considering both PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) performance. It is demonstrated that the logarithmic companding scheme, albeit providing larger PAPR reduction when compared to the SLM scheme, may result in worse BER performance due to the additional noise induced in its expanding process. Both numerical and experimental investigations show that, at the expense of increased complexity and reduced efficiency, the VLC system using the linear SLM scheme exhibits better BER performance compared to the system using the nonlinear logarithmic companding scheme. We show that for a 400-Mb/s transmission at a distance of 1 m, the BER can be reduced from 2.02 × 10 to 2.51 × 10 by using logarithmic companding scheme. By using the linear SLM scheme, the BER can be further reduced to 1.77 × 10.",

The effects of stirring rates and monomers/n-Octadecane mass ratios on the average diameter and phase change properties of microencapsulated n-Octadecane (MicroC18) were investigated. The surface morphology, diameters, phase change properties and thermal decomposition temperature of MicroC18 were investigated by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM), Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The average diameters of MicroC18 decreased with an increase of stirring rate. When the monomers/n-Octadecane mass ratio of 1:1 is used, the enthalpy of MicroC18 reaches the highest-126 J/g. Surfaces of majority of MicroC18 show large concaves because of the production of reserved expansion space in the process of micro-encapsulation. The thermal decomposition temperature of MicroC18 is about 230 °C which is higher than that of MicroC18 using melamine-formaldehyde shell. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

        "abstract": "Biomarkers for predicting chemotherapy response are important to the treatment of colorectal cancer patients. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) is a circadian clock protein involved in cell cycle, but the biologic consequences of this activity in cancer are poorly understood. We set up biochemical and cell biology analyses to analyze CRY2 expression and chemoresistance. Here, we report that CRY2 is overexpressed in chemoresistant colorectal cancer samples, and CRY2 overexpression is correlated with poor patient survival. Knockdown of CRY2 increased colorectal cancer sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer cells. We also identify FBXW7 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for targeting CRY2 through proteasomal degradation. Mechanistic studies show that CRY2 is regulated by FBXW7, in which FBXW7 binds directly to phosphorylated Thr300 of CRY2. Furthermore, FBXW7 expression leads to degradation of CRY2 through enhancing CRY2 ubiquitination and accelerating the CRY2's turnover rate. High FBXW7 expression downregulates CRY2 and increases colorectal cancer cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy. Low FBXW7 expression is correlated with high CRY2 expression in colorectal cancer patient samples. Also, low FBXW7 expression is correlated with poor patient survival. Taken together, our findings indicate that the upregulation of CRY2 caused by downregulation of FBXW7 may be a novel prognostic biomarker and may represent a new therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

        "abstract": "The Shuangwang gold deposit, located in the east of the Fengtai ore concentration area of West Qinling, is a large gold deposit of auriferous albite breccias type. The ore deposit occurs in the weakly metamorphosed upper Devonian Xinghongpu Group, dominated by calcareous siltstone, sericite silty slate and carbonate that comprise flyschoid formation. Gold mineralization is strictly controlled by auriferous breccia bodies. Pyrite is the most important ore sulfide, and the main wall-rock alteration is albitization. Systematic stable isotope analyses show that the ore -forming fluids of the early and the main stages came from mixed fluids and those of the late stage mainly came form magmatic hydrothermal fluids with the addition of a little meteoric water. Carbon was derived mainly from the great depth and partly from the dissolution of carbonate strata. Sulfur is the mixed sulfur of the crust and the magma. Lead mainly came from the upper crust with the mixture of a little mantle lead. Based on the regional geological -structural background, it is concluded that the mineralization of the Shuangwang gold deposit was related to the Late Triassic collision between the North China Plate and the Yangtze Plate. The early stage mineralization was mainly caused by hydrothermal metasomatism, and the main gold mineralization occurred at the hydrothennal filling stage after the blasting action. The Shuangwang gold deposit is genetically a cryptoexplosive breccia type gold deposit.",

The FGS encodes video trac into two dieren t layers, the non-scalable base layer (BL) and the scalable enhancement layer (EL). Considering the low-level link qual- ity and the dynamically recongurable wireless network property in ad hoc networks, transmit- ting layered video trac on multiple paths has been proposed in the literature. However, no work has been done to route the multiple paths based on the characteristics of the layered video trac. For the rst time, we dene the rout- ing criteria for the two paths in FGS multime- dia transmission: one path with shortest delay and maximum-bandwidth is routed for BL traf- c, one path with delay bound and maximum- bandwidth is routed for EL trac. The routing algorithms for the two paths are presented. Sim- ulation results shows that our scheme increases the bandwidth used for the video trac, and sat- isfy the requirements of the video trac.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The Badaguan porphyry Cu Mo deposit is located in the Derbugan metallogenic belt of northeastern Inner Mongolia, China. The host granodioritic porphyry and the wall rock granitic porphyry were emplaced at 230 Ma and 238 Ma, respectively. The granodioritic porphyry has ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr)  i   values of 0.70535–0.70549, e Nd (t) values of 0.41–1.17, e Hf (t) values of 1.30–6.51, and two–stage model ages (T DM2 ) of 1131–848 Ma. In contrast, the granitic porphyry is characterized by e Hf (t) values from − 0.75 to 7.28 that yield T DM2  model ages of 1355–816 Ma. The geochemical and Sr Nd Hf isotopic data for the magmatic rocks associated with the Badaguan porphyry Cu Mo deposit indicate that these intrusions were generated by the partial melting of juvenile lower crust. The δ 18 O values of ore fluids from different mineralizing stages are between − 6.0‰ and + 1.5‰, and the fluid δD water  values vary from − 119.3‰ to − 140.0‰, indicating a mixed fluid of magmatic and meteoric water, the S Pb isotopes show that the metal was mostly derived from a deep-seated magma that involved some crustal materials, with a narrow δ 34 S range (− 2.4‰ to + 3.5‰). We infer that the Badaguan porphyry Cu Mo deposit formed during a period of southeast–directed subduction of the Mongol–Okhotsk oceanic plate beneath the Erguna Block.",

After briefly describing the fundamental characteristics of DTN and the major challenges in designing routing protocols, the metrics used to evaluate the DTN routing protocols are proposed. Next, research on routing protocols for DTN is comprehensively summarized and deeply analyzed in this paper, including unicast routing, multicast routing, and anycast routing. Finally, the main routing protocols are compared, and the open issues for the future research are also pointed out to motivate new research and development in the field of DTN. © by Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

A QCM immunosensor was developed for the detection of triazophos by pre-coating the QCMs with toxin-specific antibodies. The antibodies immobilization technique uses self-assembly monolayer(SAM) with 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), and the QCM detection method uses dip and dry application. Upon binding of pesticide in purified form with the immobilised triazophos antibodies, the increase in mass at the QCM surface resulted in a reduction in the frequency of resonance oscillation in a manner dependent upon the amount of pesticide bound. The QCM was able to detect as low as 1 ng pesticide. This detection sensitivity is comparable to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but the assay is faster. This immunoassay was shown to be specific, sensitive, rapid and economical, thus providing a viable alternative to pesticide detection methods.",

Specifically, given a set of wiretapped links, we investigate how to maximize the weakly secure transmission rate of multiple unicast streams between a pair of source and destination nodes, and how to minimize the size of the required finite field, over which the WSLNC can be implemented. In our study, we apply a novel approach that integrates the WSLNC design and the transmission topology construction. We first provide theoretical analysis and prove that the problem of finding the optimal transmission topology is NP-hard. We then develop efficient algorithms to find optimal and sub-optimal topologies in different scenarios. With the transmission topology, we design WSLNC schemes and theoretically analyze the relationships between the transmission topology and two important system factors: (1) the size of the finite field, and (2) the probability that a random linear network coding is weakly secure. Based on the relationships, we further improve our algorithms to address the two system factors, while keeping the same maximal STR. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms can achieve good performance in various scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years, many publish/subscribe‐based information‐centric network (PS‐ICN)\n         architectures have been proposed and investigated to efficiently deliver information\n         from content publishers to subscribers. However, most existing studies on PS‐ICN have\n         not considered how to utilize in‐network caches, which is a common but important feature\n         in ICN. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel cache‐aware K‐anycast\n         routing scheme, namely, CAKA, that can significantly improve the performance of content\n         delivery. Specifically, we choose PURSUIT, which is one of the most important PS‐ICN\n         architectures, and leverage its bidirectional communication procedure to do the following:\n         (1) enable multiple publishers to send probing messages to the same subscriber; and\n         (2) allow the subscriber to retrieve ",

In this paper, we design a new supporting mechanism, have vibration tests to the ground, existing supporting mechanism and a prototype of the new supporting mechanism, analyse influence factors, change trend, power distribution of the ground vibration, calculate and compare the response of existing supporting mechanism and the prototype to ground vibration. The result shows that anti-vibration performance of the prototype is much better than the old supporting mechanism.

        "abstract": "To assess the efficacy and safety of a modified topical formalin irrigation method in refractory hemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis (CRP).Patients with CRP who did not respond to previous medical treatments and presented with grade II-III rectal bleeding according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were enrolled. Patients with anorectal strictures, deep ulcerations, and fistulas were excluded. All patients underwent flexible endoscopic evaluation before treatment. Patient demographics and clinical data, including primary tumor, radiotherapy and previous treatment options, were collected. Patients received topical 4% formalin irrigation in a clasp-knife position under spinal epidural anesthesia in the operating room. Remission of rectal bleeding and related complications were recorded. Defecation, remission of bleeding, and other symptoms were investigated at follow-up. Endoscopic findings in patients with rectovaginal fistulas were analyzed.Twenty-four patients (19 female, 5 male) with a mean age of 61.5 ± 9.5 years were enrolled. The mean time from the end of radiotherapy to the onset of bleeding was 11.1 ± 9.0 mo (range: 2-24 mo). Six patients (25.0%) were blood transfusion dependent. The median preoperative Vienna Rectoscopy Score (VRS) was 3 points. Nineteen patients (79.2%) received only one course of topical formalin irrigation, and five (20.8%) required a second course. No side effects were observed. One month after treatment, bleeding cessation was complete in five patients and obvious in 14; the effectiveness rate was 79.1% (19/24). For long-term efficacy, 5/16, 1/9 and 0/6 patients complained of persistent bleeding at 1, 2 and 5 years after treatment, respectively. Three rectovaginal fistulas were found at 1 mo, 3 mo and 2 years after treatment. Univariate analysis showed associations of higher endoscopic VRS and ulceration score with risk of developing rectovaginal fistula.Modified formalin irrigation is an effective and safe method for hemorrhagic CRP, but should be performed cautiously in patients with a high endoscopic VRS.",

The increasing adoption of lenalidomide-based therapy for frontline treatment of MM has resulted in a need for effective regimens for lenalidomide-refractory patients. This phase 1b study evaluated daratumumab plus carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) in patients with RRMM after 1-3 prior lines of therapy, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug; lenalidomide-refractory patients were eligible. Carfilzomib- and daratumumab-naïve patients (N = 85) received carfilzomib weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle (20 mg/m initial dose, escalated to 70 mg/m thereafter), and dexamethasone 40 mg/week. Of these, 10 patients received the first daratumumab dose as a single infusion (16 mg/kg Day 1 Cycle 1) and 75 patients received a split first dose (8 mg/kg Days 1-2 Cycle 1). Subsequent dosing was per the approved schedule for daratumumab. Patients received a median of 2 (range 1-4) prior lines of therapy; 60% were lenalidomide refractory. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (31%), lymphopenia (24%), anemia (21%), and neutropenia (21%). Infusion-related reactions were observed in 60% and 43% of single- and split-first dose patients, respectively. Overall response rate was 84% (79% in lenalidomide-refractory patients). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached; 12-month PFS rates were 74% for all-treated patients and 65% for lenalidomiderefractory patients. D-Kd was well tolerated with low neutropenia rates, and demonstrated deep responses and encouraging PFS, including patients refractory to lenalidomide.

        "abstract": "Microencapsulated and macroencapsulated n-dodecanol as a phase change material was fabricated using an oil-soluble melamine-formaldehyde prepolymer etherified by methanol and butanol through in situ polymerization. The surface morphology, microstructure, antiosmosis performance, mechanical properties, phase change behavior and thermal stability were systematically characterized and discussed. FTIR analysis revealed the chemical compositions of the microcapsules and primarily ascertained that n-dodecanol was encapsulated within an etherified melamine-formaldehyde resin shell. These microcapsules (mainly ranging from 1 μm to 6 μm) with well-defined core–shell structures were observed by FE-SEM and TEM. The ratio of methanol etherified melamine-formaldehyde (MMF) to butanol etherified melamine-formaldehyde (BMF) prepolymers had a great influence on their surface morphology, antiosmosis performance and mechanical properties. The as-prepared microcapsules also presented high heat storage capability and good thermal stability which could be demonstrated by DSC and TG. In addition, narrow-disperse macrocapsules containing self-assembled MMF resin microcapsules were fabricated through the piercing–solidifying method with sodium alginate as a matrix. The double-encapsulated structure was also investigated by FE-SEM combined EDS analysis, and its thermal stability was enhanced to some extent when compared with that without MMF shell encapsulation.",

The total RNA of each group were extracted, and reversed transcription to cDNA after 30 min. The expression of Runx2 in response to centrifugation in vitro was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR.The expression of Runx2 mRNA in group B was significantly higher than that in group A (P < 0.05). The expression of Runx2 mRNA in group D was significantly lower than that in group B (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference among group A, C, D (P = 0.692).BMP signal transduction pathway plays an important role in the response of osteoblasts to mechanical stimulations.

The immunosensor was fabricated by self-assembling of protein A and affinity-purified anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibodies on the gold electrode of an AT-cut piezoelectric quartz crystal. To enhance the sensitivity of the QCM\n immunosensor, nanoparticle-antibody conjugates, which were prepared using streptavidin-conjugated nanoparticles (145 nm diameter)\n and biotinylated anti-E. coli antibodies, were used for signal amplification. After the binding of E. coli O157:H7 cells with the antibodies immobilized on the electrode, nanoparticle-antibody conjugates were introduced as mass\n amplifiers. Compared to the direct detection of E. coli O157:H7, the binding of the nanoparticle conjugates further resulted in a decrease in resonant frequency and an increase\n in resonant resistance, and the detection sensitivity was improved by five orders of magnitude by lowering the detection limit\n from 107 to 102 CFU/mL. The sensor specificity and nonspecific adsorption of nanoparticle-antibody conjugates were also investigated.",

        "abstract": "Oscillatory zoned garnets are able to record numerous geological processes including variations of physicochemical conditions and hydrothermal fluid evolution. In this contribution, we present the mineralogy, petrography, and systematic major, trace and rare earth element (REE) concentrations of zoned garnets from the Xieertala Fe-Zn skarn deposit. The in situ analytical results of oscillatory zoned garnets from core to rim demonstrate that garnet cores are remarkably HREE-rich, with relatively high ��REE and HREE/LREE ratios as well as negative Eu anomalies. REE patterns of garnet rims are typically LREE-rich, with relatively low ��REE and HREE/LREE ratios and positive Eu anomalies. Estimates of PT conditions suggest that the early fluid formed in relatively high temperature, pressure and salinity conditions, while the later fluid formed in relatively low temperature, pressure and salinity conditions. This transition in P, T and salinity conditions is interpreted to be caused by the dominance of magmatic and meteoric waters in early and late stages, respectively. Based on optical and textural characteristics, REE patterns, Eu anomalies and trace element variations in zoned garnets, it can be shown that during skarn formation, Xieertala hydrothermal fluids shifted from near neutral pH and oxidizing conditions with relatively high ��REE, low LREE/HREE ratios, and U-poor and Y-rich characteristics to acidic and reducing conditions with relatively low ��REE, high LREE/HREE ratios, and U-rich and Y-poor characteristics. We infer that variations of fluid compositions and physicochemical conditions may have a major control on incorporating trace elements and REEs into different sections of oscillatory zoned garnets. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "To efficiently provide cloud storage services, most providers implement data deduplication schemes so as to reduce storage and network bandwidth consumption. Due to its broad application, many security issues about data deduplication have been investigated, such as data security, user privacy, etc. Nevertheless, we note that the threat of establishing covert channel over cloud storage has not been fully investigated. In particular, existing studies only demonstrate the potential of a single-bit channel, in which a sender can upload one of the two predefined files for a receiver to infer the information of 0 and 1. In this paper, we design a more powerful deduplicationbased covert channel that can be used to transmit a complete message. Specifically, the key features of our design include: (1) a synchronization scheme that can establish a covert channel between a sender and a receiver, and (2) a novel coding scheme that allows each file to represent multiple bits in the message. To evaluate the proposed design, we implement the covert channel and conduct extensive experiments in different cloud storage systems. Our work highlights a more severe security threat in cloud storage services.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the clinicopathologic characteristics and short-term and long-term outcomes of colorectal cancer patients with obstruction compared to those of non-obstructive colorectal cancer patients.Between January 1998 and December 2005, 1,672 colorectal cancer patients undergoing operation were enrolled in this study. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presentation: patients with complete obstructive colorectal cancer (COC, n = 215) receiving emergency procedures and patients with non-obstructive colorectal cancer (NOC, n = 1,457) receiving elective procedures. The data on the clinicopathologic characteristics and short-term and long-term outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively.Among 1,672 colorectal cancer patients, 215 cases presented with complete obstruction. The distribution of tumor location and size, macroscopic type, depth of invasion, liver metastasis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and TNM stage were found to be different between the COC and NOC groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor location, depth of invasion, and peritoneal carcinomatosis were independent factors associated with obstruction. Patients with obstruction had an increased risk of death by a factor of 2.251 compared to patients without obstruction. Peritoneal carcinomatosis and TNM stage were independent factors for the survival of the COC group. Obstruction, peritoneal carcinomatosis, tumor macroscopic type, and TNM stage were independent indicators for postoperative recurrence. Postoperative mortality was significantly higher in the COC group than the NOC group. The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates in the COC group were 47.8% and 42.8%, respectively, compared to 67.2% and 59.8% in the NOC group, respectively (p < 0.05). The postoperative recurrence rates were 43.1% in the COC group and 32.8% in the NOC group (p < 0.05).Obstruction is an independent indicator for the survival and postoperative recurrence for patients with colorectal cancer. Patients in the COC group have worse overall survival with high postoperative recurrence rate compared to those in the NOC group.",

METHODS: NOD/SCID mice were treated with 3 Gy of whole-body irradiation (WBI) and divided into three groups. Group A was given intravenous porcine BMCs. Group B was given an implant of human fetal Thy/Liv fragments (1-2 mm3) under the right kidney capsule and additionally an intravenous injection of human fetal liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) purified from the fetal livers. The treatment of group C was the combination of both group A and B. Three weeks after Thy/Liv transplantation and every three weeks thereafter, peripheral blood was drawn to determine the level of porcine and human chimerism using multicolor flow cytometric (FCM) analysis. The proliferation of the T cells was tested in a standard mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). RESULTS: Porcine chimerism persisted (>20 weeks) in all mice that received porcine BMCs, including mice that underwent human Thy/Liv implantation later. Human chimerism persisted >20 weeks in all mice that received Thy/Liv implants, regardless of whether they received porcine BMCs transplants. CONCLUSION: Human immune system is reconstituted by co-transplantation of human fetal Thy/Liv and human fetal liver MNCs in NOD/SCID mice with porcine hematopoietic chimerism. The human T cells are immunocompetent and tolerant to donor porcine BMCs.",

        "abstract": "In wireless mesh networks, delay and reliability are two critical issues in the support of delay-sensitive applications. Due to sleep scheduling designed for energy efficiency, a node along an end-to-end path needs to wait for its next hop to wake up before it can transmit, which incurs extra delay. In addition, because of unreliable wireless communications, a node may not successfully receive the packet even when it is in active mode. In this paper, we propose a coded anycast packet forwarding (CAPF) scheme for both unicast and multicast communications such that the delay can be reduced and the reliability can be improved. We theoretically analyze the impact of nodes' awake probability and the link loss probability on the end-to-end delay and the reliability. A tradeoff between the end-to-end delay and the reliability is also investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that CAPF provides a flexible mechanism to make good delay-reliability tradeoff and is effective to reduce the end-to-end delay and enhance the reliability.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the deployments of wireless sensor networks in a class of mission-critical applications such as object detection and tracking. These applications often impose stringent QoS requirements including high detection probability, low false alarm rate and bounded detection delay. Although a dense all-static network may initially meet these QoS requirements, it does not adapt to unpredictable dynamics in network conditions (e.g., coverage holes caused by death of nodes) or physical environments (e.g., changed spatial distribution of events). This paper exploits reactive mobility to improve the target detection performance of wireless sensor networks. In our approach, mobile sensors collaborate with static sensors and move reactively to achieve the required detection performance. Specifically, mobile sensors initially remain stationary and are directed to move toward a possible target only when a detection consensus is reached by a group of sensors. The accuracy of final detection result is then improved as the measurements of mobile sensors have higher signal-to-noise ratios after the movement. We develop a sensor movement scheduling algorithm that achieves near-optimal system detection performance under a given detection delay bound. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive simulations using the real data traces collected by 23 sensor nodes.",

Tumor size, distance to anal edge, and the number of mitoses were compared before and after the treatment. After 12 weeks of IM therapy, conservative surgical procedures were performed.After IM therapy for the 3 patients, computed tomography scan, colonoscopy, and biopsy showed a decrease in size of the rectal mass, an extension in the distance to anal edge, and a reduction in mitotic count. During this treatment regimen, the patients did not experience any side effects. A sphincter-preserving transsacral excision with direct coloanal anastomosis was performed and the resection margins were uninvolved on all sides. During 22 to 28 months postoperatively, the function of anal sphincter was satisfactory and no recurrence occurred among all 3 patients.Neoadjuvant IM therapy for anorectal GIST is safe and effective. Tumor shrinkage and an extension of the distance to anal edge have a clear benefit for the local excision, in terms of feasibility, function preservation, and safety.",

The specific binding between E. coli 0157:H7 cells and anti-E. coli 0157:H7 antobodies resulted in capacitance changes which was directly detected by electrochemical instrument. The experimental results indicated that capacitance change was correlated with E. coli 0157:H7 concentration. Using capacitance measurement, detection limit of 102 cfu/mL was obtained. A linear relationship range between the capacitance change and the logarithm of E. coli 0157:H7 concentration was found. Cyclic voltammetry was also employed as a confirmation method to follow the stepwise assembly of the systems. This research demonstrated that the capacitive immunosenor had potential to be an alternative rapid and specific technology for the detection of pathogenic bacteria.",

Steady-state and transient infrared spectroscopic methods in combination with quantum chemical computations and molecular dynamics simulations were used. It was found that in these solvents, NEPA exists in different aggregation forms, including monomer, dimer, and oligomers. Hydrogen-bonding interaction and local-solvent environment both affect the amide-A absorption profile and its vibrational relaxation dynamics and also affect the structural dynamics of NEPA. In particular, a correlation between the red-shifted frequency for the NEPA monomer from nonpolar to polar solvent and the vibrational excitation relaxation rate of the N-H stretching mode was observed.",

The aim of this study was to identify temporal changes in protein expression potentially associated with acute inflammation and to elucidate the mechanism underlying radiation enteritis genesis.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated in the abdomen with a single dose of 10 Gy to establish an in vivo model of acute radiation enteritis. Two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectrometer (MALDI-TOF) tandem mass spectrometry, and peptide mass fingerprinting were used to determine differentially expressed proteins between normal and inflamed intestinal mucosa. Additionally, differentially expressed proteins were evaluated by KO Based Annotation System to find the biological functions associated with acute radiation enteritis.Intensity changes of 86 spots were detected with statistical significance (ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 1.5, P < 0.05). Sixty one of the 86 spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. These radiation-induced proteins with biological functions showed that the FAS pathway and glycolysis signaling pathways were significantly altered using the KOBAS tool.Our results reveal an underlying mechanism of radiation-induced acute enteritis, which may help clarify the pathogenesis of RE and point to potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Chronic radiation proctopathy (CRP) is the delayed adverse effect after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies. It is characterized as progressive fibrosis in pathology. The symptoms are usually unspecific which include rectal bleeding, perianal pain, tenesmus, stool frequencies and so on. The course of CRP can present from months to years after radiation. Severe complications can occur in the late stage and will greatly affect the quality of life. Currently, there is no standard guides for diagnosis and treatment of CRP. For advancing the knowledge and proposing new treatment modalities of CRP, this article summarizes our 10-year experience as follows: (1) Except the existence of vessel damage, interstitial fibrosis, mucous ulcer, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in the radiation-injury area, the capillary count was obviously reduced in mucous substratum and angiostatin expression up-regulated remarkably in above area, resulting in the continuous development of compensatory capillary expansion and interstitial fibrosis in mucous layer. (2) Rectal ultrasound examination was used the first time to diagnose CRP. According to thickness change of rectal wall layer and increase of blood signal, severity of CRP activity was evaluated with good diagnostic value. (3) For slight-moderate rectal bleeding, moderate-heavy bleeding and heavy bleeding, application of retention enema with compound preparation based on mucoprotective agents, regional perfusion hemostasis with formaldehyde and proximal colostomy gained satisfactory efficacy. (4) Improved Parks operation should be recommended for CRP patients with advanced complications. (5) For rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, \"proximal extended excision\" should be performed innovatively to decrease the risk of anastomotic complications (Tianhe Procedure).",

Such wireless-optical-wireless communication mode introduced by FiWi access networks can reduce the interference in wireless subnetwork, thus improving network throughput. With the support for direct inter-ONU communication in the optical subnetwork, throughput of peer-to-peer communication in a FiWi access network can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid wavelength division multiplexed/time division multiplexed passive optical network (WDM/TDM PON) architecture supporting direct inter-ONU communication, a corresponding decentralized dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) protocol for inter-ONU communication and an algorithm to dynamically select egress ONU. The complexity of the proposed architecture is analyzed and compared with other alternatives, and the efficiency of the proposed system is validated by the simulations.",

        "abstract": "In wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks, wavelength utilization is limited by the mismatch between the high bandwidth that one wavelength can provide and the relatively low bandwidth request of a single connection. Traffic grooming which grooms multiple connections onto one wavelength is a desirable technique to improve resource utilization. However, with unpredictable traffic demand, the newly arrived request may not be accommodated using remaining resources. Rerouting which reroutes existing connections such that the newly arrived request can be accommodated is an effective approach to further improve network throughput. In this paper, we study adaptive intentional connection rerouting which intentionally triggers rerouting algorithm according to network status, with the aim to reserve maximum resources for future connections. There are two important issues in intentional rerouting scheme: when to trigger rerouting algorithm and the rule to reroute the accommodated connections. The answers to the questions can reduce network blocking probability within an appropriate number of rerouting. In this paper, we propose to use biological attractor selection approach to address the above issues so that rerouting can be performed at the right time to accommodate unpredictable traffic demand. The proposed rerouting scheme can also improve system robustness given its adaptability. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive rerouting approach.",

        "abstract": "To protect user privacy in    wireless mesh networks  , it is important to address    two   major challenges, namely,    flow untraceability   and    movement untraceability  , which prevent malicious attackers from deducing the flow paths and the movement tracks of mobile devices. For these two privacy requirements, most existing approaches rely on encrypting the whole packet, appending random padding, and applying random delay for each message at every intermediate node, resulting in significant computational and communication overheads. Recently,    linear network coding   (LNC) has been introduced as an alternative, but the    global encoding vectors   (GEVs) of coded messages have to be encrypted by homomorphic encryption to conceal the relationships between incoming and outgoing messages. In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LNC to ensure flow untraceability and movement untraceability. Specifically, we first determine the necessary and sufficient condition, with which the two privacy requirements can be achieved without encrypting either GEVs or message contents. We then design a deterministic    untraceable LNC   (ULNC) scheme to provide flow untraceability and movement untraceability when the sufficient and necessary condition is satisfied. We also provide extensive theoretical analysis on the probability that the condition is satisfied, as well as abundant discussions on the key parameters that affect the value of the probability. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed ULNC scheme.",

Their structure and magnetic properties were examined. It was found that the specific saturation magnetization σ s of these particles decrease with decreasing particle size. The Curie temperature of LiFe 5 O 8 particle 8.1 nm in diameter decreases to 590 °C and is 50 °C lower than that of the bulk. From the specific magnetization σ versus temperature T curve of nanocrystalline LiFe 5 O 8 particle (9.1 nm in diameter), it seems that this sample consists of two magnetic phases.

        "abstract": "Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has been reported as a potential tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role of alternative splicing of SYK in carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, SYK isoforms were overexpressed in the human CRC HCT 116 cell line using lentiviral expression vectors to investigate the biological functions of full length SYK [SYK(L)] and short form SYK [SYK(S)] in CRC. Real-time cellular analysis and the 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine assay were used to detect the effects of SYK(L) and SYK(S) on cell proliferation. Cell cycle progression and migration were assessed via flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. The results revealed that the recombinant lentivirus with SYK(L) overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells, while SYK(S) overexpression did not. In addition, MTS assays demonstrated that SYK(L) and SYK(S) increased the cellular sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), suggesting that SYK(L) and 5-FU produce a significant synergistic effect on CRC cell proliferation, while SYK(S) has an effect on modulating CRC 5-FU sensitivity. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction results revealed that SYK(L) was downregulated in 69% of 26 pairs of CRC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues, whereas SYK(S) exhibited no significant differences between tumor and normal tissues. Overall, the present data provides evidence that SYK(L) is a tumor suppressor in CRC, and both SYK(L) and SYK(S) may serve as important predictors in the chemotherapeutic treatment of CRC.",

        "abstract": "Located in the Variscan and Yanshanian metallogenic belt in the middle of the Da Hinggan Mountains, the Xie'ertala Fe-Zn deposit is a large-medium-size Fe-Zn deposit of volcanic eruption sedimentation-hydrothermal enrichment type discovered in recent years. Based on an analysis of material composition, the authors investigated emphatically the fluid inclusions and isotopes so as to study the ore-forming fluid evolution and mineralization. Salinity had negative correlation with fluid temperature from early to middle stage, indicating a boiling event. From middle to late stage, however, salinity was positively correlated with fluid temperatures, suggesting a mixing event. S, C, Pb, H and O isotopic compositions show that the ore-forming materials were derived mainly from country rocks and underlying rocks and partly from deeper sources. The data obtained suggest that the ore-forming fluids were derived predominantly from an active meteoric groundwater system and magmatic water. Because of meteoric supplement in the late stage, strong isotope exchange occurred between ore-forming fluids and surrounding rocks. The amount of the hydrothermal fluids in the ore-forming and alteration system was relatively insignificant. All these data demonstrate a combination of ore-forming fluids with moderate to medium-low temperature, low salinity and low density. Structural thermal effect, geothermal gradient and magmatic exhalation heat might have played the dominant role in Fe and Zn activation, whereas structural transition led to the Fe and Zn precipitation at a favorable position through changing the conditions of the primary well-evolved fluids.",

        "abstract": "Based on the analysis of 3D seismic and log data,and associated with the technology of the sequence stratigraphy and paleogeomorphology recovery,the sequence boundaries of Hainan-Xianhe zone of the western beach area of Liaohe depression are divided into four types according to the strata erosion level,including the parallel unconformity in the sag,the angular unconformity in overlap zone of the depression edge,the angular unconformity on the top of rotating fault blocks,and the angular unconformity on the top of the buried hill of the heavily erosion area.Different erosion recovery methods had been chosen for different surface types to reconstruct the key tectonic period paleogeomorphology of the zone,which shows that the area develops the incised valley,the slop break,and paleo-uplift.The paleogeomorphology presents the trough and the bridge arranged in oblique,incised valley and fault break in steep slop well developed,and provenance widely distributed and its direction cross intersected with Hainan fault.The paleogeomorphology plays an obvious role in controlling the provenance distribution,sequence stratigraphy constitution and the sandstone distribution,showing \"the great trough developing the great fan,and the small trough to the little fan\".The sandstone distribution is controlled by the fault breaks in plane and the system tracts in vertical.",

Rare earth element (REE) concentrations determined by ICP-MS are shown to characterize the ore samples and their wall rocks in three ore zones in order to reveal the origin of ore-forming materials and fluid. In AuI, REE chondrite normalized patterns of ore are similar to those of ore-controlling spilite; the ore-forming materials originated from deep magma, and magmatic activity offered main hydrothermal source for gold mineralization. The REE characteristics of AuII and AuIII are similar, and most of the ore samples are similar with the wall rocks.

The influence of concomitant risk factors was assessed using multivariate analyses.Of the 142 cases of CD patients, 64.8% required at least one operation and the cumulative rate of operation was 52% at 5 years after onset. The relative risk of operation was increased in male patients, older than 40 years of age at onset, and those with CD involving small bowel. Of the patients undergone operation, 33.9% relapsed and required reoperation subsequently. The cumulative reoperation rate was 21% at 3 years after first operation. Male gender, a perforating indication for initial operation, as well as colonic and ileocolonic disease, increased the relative risks of reoperation.Half of patients with CD will undergo an operation at 5 years after onset, and 20% of them will relapse and require reoperation at 3 years after first operation. Men run a higher risk of operation and reoperation than women do. A perforating indication for initial operation predict a higher risk of reoperation.",

Two different traffic distribution modes are considered in our study: the Fractional Flow Assignment (FFA) mode which assumes the bandwidth demand from one connection is infinitely splittable and can be assigned to different wireless access networks, and the Integral Flow Assignment (IFA) mode which assumes that at any time the bandwidth demand from each connection can only be assigned to a single wireless network. We show that the general FFA problem and the IFA problem are both NP-hard and propose optimal solutions to the four special cases of the FFA problem and heuristic solutions to the general FFA problem and the IFA problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the impact of the capacity-demand ratio on the performance of the proposed solutions.",

It also investigated the relative performance of the calibration models with different data preprocessing methods (original, first derivative, and second derivative). Reflectance spectra were collected from two opposite sides of individual peaches, followed by standard destructive methods for analyzing TSS and VA of peaches. Calibration models were developed with the use of a partial least squares (PLS) technique. The best calibration model for TSS gave good predictions of TSS, with a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.916 and a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0.534. The best calibration model for VA prediction yielded r2 = 0.904 and SEP = 0.129. Thus, FT-NIR reflectance can be used to predict the TSS and VA of intact peaches. Based on the results, it was concluded that FT-NIR spectrometry could be an easy to facilitate, reliable, accurate, and fast method for non-invasive measurement of peach TSS and VA. © 2005 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopy and open colorectomy for left-sided malignant colonic obstruction. A total of 193 colorectal carcinoma patients (55 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectomy and 138 who underwent open colorectomy) with left-sided colonic obstruction and surgical therapy, between May 2007 and March 2012, are included in the study. The short-term and long-term outcomes including curative resection rate, hospital stay time, complications, 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates and recurrence rate, as well as recurrence-free survival rate were analyzed retrospectively. No significant difference was found between the laparoscopic and open groups about the short-term outcomes, such as the curative resection rate (81.82 vs. 78.99%, P=0.658), hospital stay time (24.22±17.09 vs. 24.19±14.76 day, P=0.990), the overall and respective complications (32.73 vs. 39.63%, P=0.674). Long-term outcomes, including 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates (P=0.518), recurrence rates (P=0.320), and recurrence-free survival rates (P=0.988), were also indicated no significant differences between the two patient groups.

        "abstract": "A disintegrin and metalloprotease 8 (ADAM8) has been reported to be associated with various malignancies. However, no studies have examined ADAM8 association in colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and function of ADAM8 in CRC.Expression level of ADAM8 in CRC was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining analysis. The role of ADAM8 in colorectal carcinogenesis was evaluated by in vitro assays. The correlations between ADAM8 status and clinicopathological features including survival were analyzed.ADAM8 was highly expressed in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of ADAM8 in two CRC cell lines resulted in reduced cellular growth and proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed no significant correlations of ADAM8 protein expression with clinicopathologic features. Survival analysis indicated that patients with ADAM8-positive tumors had worse 5-year overall survival (OS, p = 0.037) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS, p = 0.014) compared with those with ADAM8-negative tumors. Multivariate analysis indicated ADAM8 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both OS and DFS (both p< 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that 5-year OS of colon cancer, T3-T4 stage and N0 stage was worse for patients with ADAM8-positive tumors than those with ADAM8-negative tumors (p < 0.05). The 5-year DFS in colon cancer, T3-T4 stage, N0 stage, TNM stage II, adenocarcinoma, moderate differentiation and male patient subgroups was also worse for patients with ADAM8-positive tumors than those with ADAM8-negative tumors (p < 0.05).Our results show that ADAM8 is overexpressed in CRC, promotes cell growth and correlates with worse OS and DFS, and thus could serve as a biomarker for individual CRC patient therapy.",

We formally model the problem as a problem of finding k shortest lightpaths from sources to the core subject to the constraint of wavelength collision free. We define and study several subproblems, each addressing a different objective. For the feasibility and the minimum total cost problems of k shortest lightpaths, we show how the classical network flow algorithms can be modified and applied efficiently on the network flow model constructed on the transformed wavelength graph. For the minimum max-cost problem, we prove its NP-completeness and propose two efficient heuristic algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms perform very close to the calculated lower bounds.",

        "abstract": "The continuous growth of media-rich content calls for more efficient and secure methods for content delivery. In this paper, we will address the optimal linear network coding (LNC) design for secure unicast streaming against passive attacks, under the requirement of information theoretical security . The objectives include 1) satisfying the information theoretical security requirement, 2) maximizing the transmission rate of a unicast stream, 3) minimizing the number of additional random symbols, and 4) minimizing the total bandwidth cost of content delivery. To fulfill the first three objectives, we formulate an information theoretically secure unicast streaming (ITSUS) problem, and then solve it by transforming it to a maximum network flow problem with node-capacity constraints. Based on the solution of the ITSUS problem, we develop an efficient algorithm that can find the optimal transmission topology with minimum bandwidth cost in a polynomial amount of time. With the optimal transmission topology, we investigate the design of both deterministic LNC and random LNC. For the deterministic LNC design, we not only prove that it achieves the four objectives but also analyze the size of required finite field. Moreover, for the random LNC design, we analyze the probability that a random LNC scheme satisfies the information theoretical security requirement. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "DL-2-hydroxy-4(methylthio) butanoic acid (DL-HMTBA) exhibits a higher antioxidant capability in vitro as compared to DL-Met, but the mechanism is still not known. A total of 400 8-day-old broiler chicks were allotted to a 2 [low (12 to 14°C) vs. control temperature (thermoneutral, 24 to 26°C)] × 2 (0.17% or 0.51% of DL-HMTBA) factorial arrangement to investigate effects of DL-HMTBA on antioxidant capacity and its related gene expression in lung and liver of broilers exposed to low temperature. The hepatic glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were decreased, whereas protein carbonyl and malodndialdehyde contents in lung were increased in low temperature (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 0.51% DL-HMTBA increased (P < 0.05) GSH and GSH-Px activity in liver and SOD activity in lung in spite of the temperature. The greater gene expression of GSH reductase and lower expression of GSH synthetase (P < 0.01) were observed in lung of broilers that were maintained at low temperature. Higher DL-HMTBA supplementation induced greater (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of glutathione-S transferase in lung, GSH synthetase in liver and lung, as well as lower expression of GSH reductase in lung, and this effect were more obvious for the chicks exposed to low temperature (interaction, P < 0.05). Chicks that were maintained under low temperature had the lower expression of cystathionine β-synthase (CβS), whereas those fed 0.51% DL-HMTBA increased the CβS expression in liver under low temperature (interaction, P ≤ 0.05). The γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase and Met adenosyltransferase 1 (MAT1) gene expression were downregulated (P < 0.05) by low temperature and the higher (P = 0.02) expression of MAT1 was observed in lung of chicks fed 0.51% DL-HMTBA. It indicated that under low temperature, DL-HMTBA supplementation at 0.51% upregulated gene expression of GSH synthesis and Met transsulfuration pathway in liver and lung to increase the antioxidant capacity, and then mitigate the negative effects of cold stress for broilers.",

The pure Fe-SiO2 and Fe20Ni80-SiO2 granular solid samples were fabricated using a sol-gel method in which the nanoscale bcc structure Fe and fcc structure Fe20Ni80 particles are dispersed in the silica matrix. The average size of the metal particles in the two discussed Fe-SiO2 and Fe20Ni80-SiO2 granular solid samples are 10 nm and 8 nm, respectively. The obtained values of the effective magnetic anisotropy are in the order of the 106 erg/cm3 and almost independent with temperature from 80K to 300K for these granular solid samples. These values are far larger than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy for the bulk bcc structure Fe and fee structure Fe20Ni80. The larger stress magnetic anisotropy may result in these larger magnetic anisotropy for these granular solid samples. It was found that the effective magnetic anisotropy of the Fe-SiO2 granular solid is larger than that of the Fe20Ni80-SiO2 granular solid, which may result from the larger stress anisotropy in Fe-SiO2 granular solid than in Fe20Ni80-SiO2 granular solid and the reason is discussed. ? 1996 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that traffic safety and efficiency can be substantially improved by  vehicle platooning , in which vehicles periodically broadcast their kinetic status to neighbors, known as   beacon message dissemination . As a networked control system, vehicle platoon has attracted significant attention from both the control and networking areas. However, few studies consider the practical traffic scenario with both platoons and individual vehicles, and the proposed beaconing schemes lack the deep understanding of relationship between the beaconing performance and the requirements of the control mechanism. To address these challenging issues, we propose a joint control–communication design to achieve reliable vehicle platooning in a more realistic traffic scenario, wherein the traffic consists of both platoons and individual vehicles, and both periodic beacon messages and event-based safety messages shall be delivered together. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive control-theoretical analysis to understand how the vehicular communication can affect features of platoon driving; based on the understanding, we then propose and analyze an adaptive platoon-based message dissemination scheme; finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the protocol and to confirm the accuracy of the our theoretical analysis.",

Parameter analysis indicated that there were many low sensitivity parameters in WASP model and several groups of parameters were correlative apparently. For analyzing effects of sensitivity and correlativity, four numerical experiments were designed. Resulted indicated that global searching method could solve global optimization well and also was an efficient step to acquire auxiliary information of parameters, and MCMC method could sample posterior distributions of parameters effectively; moreover, sampling series could converge to the posterior distributions of parameters eventually. Case study indicated that it was efficient and practicable for the soft-computing approach presented by the paper to identify parameters of complicated model.",

        "abstract": "The next generation multimedia applications such as video conferencing and HDTV have raised tremendous challenges on the network design, both in bandwidth and service. As wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) networks have emerged as a promising candidate for future networks with large bandwidth, supporting efficient multicast in WDM networks becomes eminent. Different from the IP layer, the cost of multicast at the WDM layer involves not only bandwidth (wavelength) cost, but also wavelength conversion cost and light splitting cost. It is well known that the optimal multicast problem in WDM networks is NP-hard. In this paper, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm consisting of two separate but integrated steps: multicast routing and wavelength assignment. We prove that the problem of optimal wavelength assignment on a multicast tree is not NP-hard; in fact, an optimal wavelength assignment algorithm with complexity of O(NW) is presented. Simulation results have revealed that the optimal wavelength assignment beats greedy algorithms by a large margin in networks using many wavelengths on each link such as dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) networks. Our proposed heuristic multicast routing algorithm takes into account both the cost of using wavelength on links and the cost of wavelength conversion. The resulting multicast tree is derived from the optimal lightpaths used for unicast",

        "abstract": "Resistant starch (RS) was recently approved to exert a powerful influence on gut health, but the effect of RS on the cecal barrier function in meat ducks has not been well defined. Thus, the effect of raw potato starch (RPS), a widely adopted RS material, on microbial composition and barrier function of cecum for meat ducks was determined. Cherry Valley male ducks, 360,1-day-old, were randomly divided and fed diets with 0% (control), 12%, or 24% RPS for 35 d. Diets Supplemented with RPS significantly elevated villus height and villus height: crypt depth ratio in the cecum. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that the diet with 12% RPS had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and the butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium, Subdoligranulum, and Erysipelatoclostridium were enriched among all diets. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly increased in the 24% RPS diet vs. the control diet. When compared with the control diet, the diet with 12% RPS also was found to notably increase acetate, propionate and butyrate contents, and up-regulated barrier-related genes including Claudin-1, Zonula occludens (ZO)-1, mucin-2, and proglucagon of cecum. Furthermore, addition of 12% RPS significantly reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and endotoxin concentrations. These data revealed that diets supplemented with 12% RPS partially improved cecal barrier function in meat ducks by enhancing intestinal morphology and barrier markers expression, modulating the microbiota composition, and attenuating inflammatory markers.",

In this study, the effects on the surface morphology and microstructure of micro/nanocapsules caused by microencapsulating different types of core materials (i.e., -hexadecane, ethyl hexadecanoate, hexadecyl acrylate and poly(hexadecyl acrylate)) were systematically studied via field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The confined crystallization behavior of comb-like polymer PCMs cores was investigated via differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Comparing with low molecular organic PCMs cores, the thermal stability of PCMs microencapsulated comb-like polymer enhanced significantly, and the permeability resistance improved obviously as well. Based on these resultant analysis, the microencapsulated comb-like polymeric PCMs with excellent thermal stability and permeability resistance showed promising foreground in the field of organic solution spun, melt processing and organic coating.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, edge computing has become a hot topic because it can significantly reduce the latency of network services by utilizing the computation resources at the edge of the network. To further improve the latency performance, several coded distributed computing (CDC) schemes have been proposed, in which computation and communication resources can be used to trade off the delay. To design CDC scheme, data shuffling among computing nodes has been studied but the security issue in data shuffling has not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate secure data shuffling in edge computing. Specifically, we first formulate a weakly secure edge computing problem, namely, the secure coded distributed computing (SCDC) problem. We then theoretically analyze the existence of weakly secure data shuffling. Based on the analysis, we propose a redundancy reduction (RR) algorithm to assign computing tasks to distributed nodes to minimize the latency with security guarantee, where we prove the correctness of the algorithm and the reduction ratio when RR is compared to existing CDC schemes. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments that confirm the efficiency of the proposed RR scheme.",

        "abstract": "Fine equiaxed ��-CoxFe2-xO3 (x=0, 0.06) particles with a diameter ranging from 200 to 1000 ? were prepared by chemical precipitation. The average crystallite sizes were determined from x-ray line broadening measurements. The saturation magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the particles were determined by using the approach to saturation. An empirical linear dependence of the specific saturation magnetization ��s on the specific surface area S a of the fine crystallites was obtained in the form of ��s(S)=��s(��)(1-ASa). The slope A which reflects the surface spin canting anomaly is different for ��-Fe2O3 and ��-Co0.06Fe 1.94O3 particles. Under the supposition of the fine crystallite consisting of two parts, i.e., the surface layer, whose magnetic moment cannot be turned entirely along the direction of the applied field, but makes an average canting angle with the field, and the inner part, whose magnetic moment can be aligned along the direction of the applied field, the above formula can be interpreted well. The different slope A for ��-Fe 2O3 and ��-Co0.06Fe1.94O 3 particles may be caused by the different anisotropies of the two series particles.",

        "abstract": "Selling spectrum resources to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) is popular among primary network operators (POs) for increasing licensed spectrum utilization. An MVNO seeks transmission opportunities (TXOPs) on the PO's licensed spectrum channel(s) by spectrum sensing. Since licensed primary users (PUs) often have higher transmission priority, TXOPs available to the MVNO are directly determined by PUs' transmission behaviors. In this paper, we present the first study that uses a pricing scheme to regulate PUs' transmission behaviors so that TXOPs for an MVNO are improved, meanwhile quality-of-service (QoS) of PUs can be guaranteed as well. Our idea is to design a non-uniform pricing scheme that regulates PUs to transmit based on a time-varying non-uniform transmission cost. We model the optimal pricing problem as a hierarchical game where the interaction between the PO and PUs is modeled as a Stackelberg game and the spectrum random access among PUs is modeled as a non-cooperative game. We first solve the non-cooperative game among PUs, as a building block, then we embed its outcome to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to solve the whole optimal pricing problem. We strictly shows that there could be multiple optimal pricing schemes for a PO. Comprehensive simulations confirm the theoretical analysis, and valid the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",

        "title": "Mineralization age and geodynamic background for the Shangjiazhuang Mo deposit in the Jiaodong gold province, China",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The Shangjiazhuang Mo deposit is located on the Jiaodong Peninsula in eastern China, which is famous for the ca. 120 Ma “Jiaodong-type” Au deposits with total Au endowment of over 3000 t. In this paper, we discuss the deposit geology, mineralization age, and geochemical features of the host granodiorite of the Shangjiazhuang Mo orebody. Using this information, we aim to clarify the time and geodynamic mechanism for the Mo deposit, which is another constraint to understand the genesis of Au deposits. The Mo mineralization generally occurs as quartz–sulfide veins within the medium-grained Yashan granodiorite. The alteration consists of potassic alteration, silicification, sericitization, chloritization, and carbonatization with a weak unclear zonation. The ore minerals mainly include molybdenite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite. We measured Re–Os isotopes of molybdenite grains, which yielded a weighted mean model age of 116.9 ± 0.81 (MSWD = 1.03) and a well-constrained  187 Re– 187 Os isochron age of 117.1 ± 1.4 Ma (MSWD = 1.6). These ages are slightly younger than the age of Au mineralization on the Jiaodong Peninsula. Rhenium contents of 5.84–29.99 ppm with an average of 16.4 ppm in molybdenites indicate a crustal source. Whole-rock geochemical compositions show that the granodiorite is high-K calc-alkaline and metaluminous to peraluminous. The samples show low Y contents from 8.2 to 10.5 ppm and Sr/Y ratios from 48.2 to 58.8, displaying an adakitic affinity. The Yashan granodiorite has high initial  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of 0.7101 to 0.7104, low e Nd (t) values of − 17.6 to − 16.7, and zircon e Hf (t) values from − 24.8 to − 17.1, with corresponding Hf model ages of 2.7 to 2.2 Ga. These isotopic data, together with the adakitic affinity of the granodiorite, indicate that the parental magma was derived from ancient crust. Mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) that are contemporaneous with the host granodiorite show SiO 2  contents of 57.98–58.41 wt% and depletion in Nb–Ta. The MMEs show enriched initial  87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of 0.7102 to 0.7106 and low e Nd (t) values of − 17.3 to − 16.3. The MMEs are the products of mixing between the metasomatized lithospheric mantle-derived mafic magma and the ancient crust-derived felsic magma. The Early Cretaceous Mo mineralization (120–110 Ma) is slightly younger than the peak time of Au mineralization (126–120 Ma) on the Jiaodong Peninsula, but have a different spatial distribution which suggests different sources of Au and Mo. The “Jiaodong-type” Au deposits were probably related to the upwelling of metasomatized lithospheric mantle, while the Mo mineralization on the Jiaodong Peninsula may delineate a 120–110 Ma Mo metallogenic belt along the southern margin of the North China Craton with the East Qinling, which is related to the melting of ancient crustal sources. The subduction of the Paleo-Pacific slab and accompanying asthenospheric upwelling triggered upwelling of metasomatized lithospheric mantle, forming “Jiaodong-type” Au deposits. Subsequently, the ponding of mantle-derived magmas resulted in partial melting of ancient crust and associated Mo deposits.",

We formally model the problem as a problem of finding k shortest lightpaths from sources to the core with the constraint of wavelength collision free. To address different objectives, we define and study several subproblems. For the feasibility and the minimum total cost problems of k shortest lightpaths, we show how the classical network flow algorithms can be modified and applied efficiently on the network flow model constructed on the transformed wavelength graph. For the minimum max-cost and the constrained feasibility problems, we prove their NP-completeness and propose two efficient heuristic algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms achieve performance very close to the calculated lower bounds.",

        "abstract": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is emerging as the next inevitable technology for application developments. One fundamental issue of SOA is service composition, i.e., to seamlessly compose distributed services into more complex applications. In the mobile environment, a service composition may face disruptions caused by the movement of both users and service providers. Thus, a dependable service composition is desired to handle the mobility in the environment. In this paper, we propose to achieve dependable service composition by taking the mobility prediction of the service providers into consideration. We exploit the fact that the service providers can predict their stay time in the current environment. However, some uncertainty may exist in the prediction such that a service provider may move out of the current environment earlier than the prediction. We use two models to characterize the uncertainty, a probability-free model and a probabilistic model. Our objective is to design dependable service composition under these two models such that the service composition solution can have the maximum tolerance to the uncertainty of the mobility prediction. We focus on the case of sequential service composition, prove the NP-hardness of the problem, then present heuristic algorithms, derive the upper and lower bounds of the problem. Simulation results have showcased the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms.",

The absolute structure of  was determined using X-ray diffraction. Because of the low yield of , a comprehensive characterization of the BACE1 inhibitory activities of  was completed  molecular biological, cell and animal studies guided by  target confirmation (ISTC). ISTC assays suggested that compounds  and  might be BACE1 inhibitors. In cell-based tests, asperterpenes A and B, as natural products, exhibited promising inhibitory activities against BACE1, with IC values of 78 and 59 nM, respectively. LY2811376 (the positive control), one of the most potent clinical BACE1 inhibitors, has shown an IC value of 260 nM. , compound  exhibited activity similar to that of LY2811376 against Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 3xTg AD mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that asperterpene A, which contains a novel carbon skeleton, is the first terpenoid to exhibit effective BACE1 inhibitory activity. Moreover,  represents a potential lead compound and a versatile scaffold for the development of drugs for the treatment of AD.",

Nanocrystalline material has a great variation of the surface and interracial state [1-3], and low saturation magnetization compared with that of bulk materials [4]. In this study we prepared nanocrystals of spinel-type LiFesO8 ferrite by using the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) gel method. The Li2CO3, Fe(NO3)3, PEG (molecular weight 20 000) and HNO3 used were of analytically pure grade. The PEG solution was mixed with the mixture of LizCO3, Fe(NO3)3 and HNO3, then dehydrated at <100 °C and decomposed for PEG at <300 °C to produce the precursor. The precursor was calcined at 250-800 °C for 2-6 h in air to yield nanocrystalline LiFesOs 9.1, 16.4, 22.6, 27.3, 32.4, 46.7 and >100 nm in size. Fig. 1 is a differential thermal analysis (DTA) profile of the LiFesO 8 precursor with heating at 10 °Cmin -1 in oxygen using a System 7/7 model (USA). The nitrate and PEG decomposed, respectively, at 157 °C and 181 or 268 °C. The nanocrystalline LiFesO8 was formed at 303 °C. The crystal structure of the ferrite was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D/max-r A model (Japan) (Fig. 2). The average crystal size was evaluated by XRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2000 FX model (Japan). The XRD result was identical to that using TEM. The magnetic properties were measured from ambient temperature to 700 °C in a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSG) up to a field of 95 kAm -1. Saturation magnetization was obtained by extrapolating to an infinite magnetic field in a plot of (a)",

In this context, we propose a new method to optimize cycling clothes’ patterns based on the difference of static-to-dynamic clothing pressure (DSDCP). Firstly, we mapped 53 measuring points on an upper cycling garment on which we measured garment pressures in both static and dynamic conditions. We then analyzed DSDCP to find the rightful garment patterns to adjust according to the analyzed results. A garment optimization degree (OD) is proposed to carry out a quantitative analysis for garment comfort optimization. Finally, two upper cycling garments were made according to the original patterns and optimized patterns. A comparative analysis through cyclist wear trials of the cycling garments to test the optimization effect was done. Results show that our proposed method improves dynamic wear comfort significantly. Moreover, the optimized upper cycling garment, offers additional improvement of dynamic wear comfort.",

The results showed that Tris-HCl was a suitable buffer for dilution, since it could distinguish well between different concentrations and had the lowest background signals. And MgCl 2 could intensify luminescence distinctly, while the other four chemical substances decreased luminescence, of which NaOH decreased luminescence most obviously. Moreover, ATP bioluminescence was correlated well with conventional culture methods (r=0.96), and the detection limit was 10 3 cells · mL -1.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, many cross-VM covert channels have been discovered in cloud computing, causing serious security concerns. For such covert channels, some mitigation schemes have been proposed, but usually one mitigation scheme aims at a specific covert channel, which may be inefficient in defending against potential new attacks. In this paper, we propose a generic solution to mitigate the risk of a broad class of timing-based cross-VM covert channels. The design is motivated by our finding that the capacity of most timing-based cross-VM covert channels highly depends on the co-run probability among VMs, where the co-run probability depends not only on how VMs are assigned to servers, but also how VMs are scheduled on a single server, which is related to managing the vCPUs assigned to each VM. We find that the VM co-run probability can be reduced when the number of vCPUs increases, but it also causes extra system overhead in resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a generic VM provisioning and VM scheduling solution to jointly minimize the co-run probability among VMs, meanwhile, maintaining high resource utilization. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed scheduling algorithm can mitigate the risk of timing-based cross-VM covert channel with lower system overhead. We also conduct simulation of VM provisioning which shows that the proposed solution can achieve the balance between high resource utilization and low risk of information leakage caused by cross-VM covert channels.",

        "abstract": "Sufficient computing resources available at future generation routers in the access/aggregation networks can be pooled to form a cloud at edge, which we call Access/Aggregation Network Cloud (or ANC). An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.",

        "abstract": "As virtualization is becoming a promising way to support various emerging application, provisioning survivability to requested virtual networks (VN) in a resource efficient way is important. In this paper, we investigate the survivable VN embedding (SVNE) problem from a new perspective. First, we consider the failure dependent protection (FDP) in which each primary facility node would have a different backup facility node, as opposed to the Failure Independent Protection (FIP) which has been studied before, in order to provide the same degree of protection against a single node failure with less substrate resources. Secondly, we enhance the VN with additional computing and communication resources and design the Enhanced VN (or EVN) before embedding it to the substrate in order to further reduce the amount of substrate resources needed to survive a single facility node failure. The work is the first that combines the FDP with EVN design (FD-EVN) to explore a resource efficient solution to the SVNE problem. After presenting a binary quadratic programming (BQP) formulation of the FD-EVN design problem and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of the EVN embedding (EVNE) problem, we propose two heuristic algorithms for FD-EVN design, as well as an EVNE algorithm that explores primary and backup substrate resources sharing. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the solutions to the BQP/MILP formulation when possible, and the heuristics. The proposed FD-EVN approach has shown to be resource efficient and in particular, outperform other approaches in terms of request acceptance ratio and embedding cost, although as a tradeoff, requiring more service migration after failures.",

In the proposed system, the receiver is composed of a horizontal photodetector (PD) and two tilted PDs, and a known calibration point is deployed to improve the accuracy of the positioning. Based upon the multi-PDs’ relative positions and the received signal strength, the location of the receiver can be estimated regardless of the LEDu0027s and PDs’ characteristics. The influences of tilted PDs on the positioning errors are discussed, i.e., the polar angle  α  and the difference  θ  between two azimuth angles. The experimental results show that high accuracy can be achieved when  α  = 20° and  θ  ranges from 30° to 90°. The average and maximum errors are 2.15 and 4.01 cm, respectively, in the case of  α  = 20° and  θ  = 45°. The proposed system avoids the intercell interference caused by different transmitters and can be applied in scenarios with limited LEDs.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) played a pivotal role in the regulation of disease progression and correlated with tumor prognosis. Here, we characterized the prognostic effect of p-p38 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Three hundred and sixteen CRC patients in stages I-III were recruited in this study. P-p38 expression was semi-quantitatively evaluated using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry staining. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local failure-free survival (LFFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patient subgroups, segregated by p-p38 expression level and clinical stage, were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We found that p-p38 was overexpressed in 48.1 % (152/316) CRC tissues, whereas low or deficiently expressed in normal adjacent epithelia. Overexpression of p-p38 predicted poor OS (P < 0.001), DFS (P = 0.002), LFFS (P = 0.016), and DMFS (P = 0.025) in CRC. Importantly, patient subgroups in the early stage (stages I + II) and with low p-p38 had similar OS, PFS, LFFS, and DMFS probabilities to that of stage I, whereas those with high p-p38 were similar to stage III disease. In addition, for stage III disease, the subgroup with low p-p38 had a similar survival probability to that of stage I, whereas the subgroup with high p-p38 had the worst survival. Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed that p-p38 was indeed a significantly independent factor for death, recurrence, and distant metastases in CRC. Our results demonstrated that p-p38 was a negative independent prognostic factor for CRC. Complementing TNM staging with p-p38 might refine the risk definition more accurately for a subset of patients.",

        "abstract": "While previous studies have shown that the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) alone is not sufficient to reflect tumor progression and that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is correlated with colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis, COX-2 expression status and its potential functions in CTCs of CRC patients are unknown. Here, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype-based subsets of CTCs and the COX-2 expression status in CTCs were identified and their potential clinical values were assessed in 91 CRC patients. CTCs were enumerated in peripheral blood and subsets of CTCs (epithelial [eCTCs], mesenchymal [mCTCs], and biophenotypic [bCTCs]) and the COX-2 expression status were determined using the RNA in situ hybridization method. CTCs were detected in 80.2% (73 of 91) patients. Neither the total CTC nor eCTC numbers were found to significantly associate with any of the clinicopathological features. However, the number of mCTCs was significantly associated with distance metastasis (P = 0.035) and had a trend of being associated with lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.055). Among the 73 patients enrolled for evaluating COX-2 expression, 52.5% (38 of 73) were found to express COX-2 in CTCs, and COX-2 expression in CTCs was not found to associate with the clinicopathological factors. However, COX-2 expression in mCTCs tended to have a higher rate in patients with metastasis compared with those without metastasis (72.0% vs 42.8%; P = 0.072). Furthermore, COX-2 expression and mCTC marker expression correlated positively ( R = 0.287; P = 0.017). Further studies are required to investigate the clinical value of the expression of COX-2 in mCTCs, especially in CRC patients with the advanced tumor stage and distant metastasis.",

        "abstract": "The KRAS gene frequently mutates in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we investigated the prognostic and predictive role of KRAS mutation in patients with stage II or III CRC.A consecutive cohort of patients with stage II or III CRC from a single center database was studied. The association between KRAS status, adjuvant FOLFOX therapy, and 3-year disease-free survival (3-y DFS) was analyzed.Of our 433 patients, 166 (38.3%) exhibited the KRAS mutation. Among the 190 patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy, those with KRAS mutation tumors had a worse 3-y DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.924; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.078-3.435; P = 0.027). Among patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, KRAS mutation was not correlated with worse 3-y DFS (HR, 1.083; 95% CI, 0.618-1.899; P = 0.781). Adjuvant chemotherapy improved 3-y DFS only among patients with KRAS mutant tumors (78.0% vs 69.2%) on multivariate analysis adjusted for age, stage, grade, site, vessel invasion, and carcinoembryonic antigen level (HR, 0.454; 95% CI, 0.229-0.901; P = 0.024). In contrast, there was no benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in the KRAS wild-type group (84.3% vs 82.0%).KRAS mutation indicates poor prognosis. FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy benefits patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer with KRAS mutant tumors and is worth further investigation.",

Besides, the thermal weight loss mechanism of Micro/NanoPCMs was clearly investigated using combined analysis of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and OM. MacroPCMs with various narrow-disperse diameter containing Micro/NanoPCMs were prepared through polymer solution spray method, also the morphology, microstructure and the influencing factor were mainly explored. Furthermore, the concerted metal-ion complexation among macrocapsule alginate matrix, capsule shell and carboxylic carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) were also studied by FE-SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) in detail. Based on these resultant analyses, the obtained narrow-disperse MacroPCMs showed promising prospect in the field of thermal energy storage and thermal-regulated fabrics.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the complications of colonic stenting versus emergency surgery for acute left-sided malignant colonic obstruction.Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Only prospective randomized controlled trials that compared the 2 methods were included. Evaluation indexes in our study involved hospital death rates and complications.No significant difference in either hospital death rates or the overall complications between the 2 groups was found. Heterogeneity analysis found that there was no significant heterogeneity. Removing individual studies from the data editor did not substantially change the RR or the level of heterogeneity of significance for our 2 outcome measures. Testing for publication bias showed that hospital death rates and the overall complications had no serious publication bias.Colonic stenting was no better than emergency surgery, and should be only used as an alternative to emergency surgery carefully.",

        "abstract": "Intrusion detection is an important class of wireless sensor network applications with critical performance require- ments. Due to the high deployment cost, it is crucial to understand and predict the intrusion detection capability of a surveillance sensor network. However, most existing analytical studies are based on simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of detection. In practice, data fusion has been adopted in a number of sensor systems to deal with sensing uncertainty and enable the collaboration among sensors. However, the performance analysis of wireless sensor networks designed based on data fusion has received little attention. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental detection performance of large-scale sensor networks under stochastic sensing models that take into account several realistic sensing characteristics such as signal decay and false alarms. Our results show that 1) data fusion is effective in achieving stringent performance requirements such as short detection delay and low false alarm rates, especially in the scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs); 2) the disc sensing model is only suitable when the SNR is sufficiently high. Our results help understand the impact of data fusion and provide important guidelines for the design of wireless sensor networks for intrusion detection.",

        "abstract": "Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising all-optical switching mechanism and signaling is one of the key technologies of optical burst switched networks. According to the propagation direction of control packets, an existing OBS signaling can be classified as one-way or two-way signaling. The transmission of bursts in two-way signaling is guaranteed while in one-way signaling is unguaranteed, so the blocking rate in two-way signaling is less than in one-way signaling. But the end-to-end delay and operation complexity in two-way is greater than in one-way signaling. In this paper, we propose another two-way signaling named subscription-based tell-and-wait (S-TAW), which is a forward reserved, delay-configured and implicitly released two-way OBS signaling. By analysis and simulation, we show that S-TAW can reduce the operation complexity and end-to-end delay without greatly increasing the blocking rate, comparing with the existing best-performed two-way signaling—prebooking reservation mechanism.",

However, it remains a nascent area of research in providing an integrated structure for multiple queries on multidimensional data in a distributed environment. In this paper, we propose a new data structure, called BR-tree (Bloom-filter-based R-tree), and implement such a prototype in the context of a distributed system. The node in a BR-tree, viewed as an expansion from the traditional R-tree node structure, incorporates space-efficient Bloom filters to facilitate fast membership queries. The proposed BR-tree can simultaneously support not only existing point and range queries, but also cover and bound queries that can potentially benefit various data indexing services. Compared with previous data structures, BR-tree achieves space efficiency and provides quick response ({\\le}O(logn)) on these four types of queries. Our extensive experiments in a distributed environment further validate the practicality and efficiency of the proposed BR-tree structure.",

        "abstract": "Hairy enhancer of split-1 (HES1) is a transcriptional target of the Notch pathway, and a high level of HES1 is regarded as a marker of activated Notch. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of HES1 in colorectal cancer progression. We used tissue microarrays to analyze the expression and clinical significance of HES1 in 320 colorectal cancer samples. Stable overexpression and knockdown of HES1 were established in three colorectal cancer cell (CRC) lines (RKO, HCT8 and LOVO). We investigated the differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways in HES1 overexpressing CRC cells by gene expression profiling. Also, the role of HES1 in invasion and migration were examined in vitro and in vivo. We found that high expression of HES1 was significantly correlated with distal metastasis (P = 0.037) at diagnosis, and HES1 could serve as an unfavorable prognostic factor for colorectal cancer patients (P = 0.034). Gene expression profiling and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that HES1 was related to cellular adherens junction loss. In addition, we showed that HES1 overexpression lead to depressed E-cadherin, and elevated N-cadherin, vimentin and Twist-1 levels. Functionally, HES1 enhanced invasiveness and metastasis of CRC cells. HES1 promotes cancer metastasis via inducing epithelial mesenchymal transition and serves as a poor prognosis factor of colorectal cancer patients.",

Regional uplift and denudation are criticai factors controlling post-ore change and preservation of ore deposits. Teetono-thermochronology is an effective way to study regional uplift and denudation, quantitatively providing denudation rate and degree. This paper focused on gold deposits and host rock (Linglong granite) in the northwestern Jiaodong Gold Province, China. Apatite Fission Track (AFT) thermochronology was used to evaluate uplift and denudation history of Linglong granite since 110Ma. The results show that denudation rates are very small, with an average of 0.0303 ±0.0044mm -a -1 , suggesting that the post-ore tectonothermal event is gentle and very beneficial to ore preservation. According to granite denudation rate, the erosion depth was calculated 2.0∼4.2km, far less than the largest mineralization depths mainly concentrated on 4∼10km. Considering that the current depth of exploration and mining is less than 2km, the space with deep gold exploration and prospecting is promising.",

        "abstract": "The Wurinitu W-Mo deposit,located in Sunid Zuoqi,Inner Mongolia,is a large scaled W-Mo deposit which is discovered in recent years.The W-Mo orebodies mainly occurred in Yanshanian granite rock body and the nearby contact zone,with the major type of veinlet mineralization.The measured δ34SV-CDT value of the Wurinitu orebody(0.6‰ to 4.1‰) varies in a very limited range and suggests that the formation of W-Mo ore-body is closely related to magmatism and the sulfur may be leached from the granite intrusion.Based on tectonic patterns of lead isotope and related parameters,the lead isotopic compositions of the Wurinitu orebody(208Pb/204Pb=38.115-38.353,207Pb/204Pb=15.528-15.591,206Pb/204Pb=18.375-18.528) indicate that the mineralization may be induced by the magmatism,and ore-forming material is characterized by the source of lower crust and show crust-mantle mixing.δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW of the hydrothermal calcite are from-8.63‰ to-6.41‰ and from-1.49‰ to 8.72‰,respectively.It shows that the hydrothermal calcite forms in two mineralization stages.The CO2 in the earlier stage is related to the magma;and the later hydrothermal ore fluids show the characteristics of mixture fluids of meteoric water with magmatic water as the meteoric water added.",

An OFDM-ROF system simulation model basing on IEEE 802.16a physical layer protocol had been built up. Special attention had been paid on the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signal which greatly constrained the performance of the OFDM-ROF system. A clipping and filtering technology had been investigated and simulated. Compared with the Naquist sampled, the two over sampled signal had a better performance in reducing PAPR. The bit error rate (BER) error flow research had been done with transmitting the clipped signal in nonlinear distorted ROF link. And the QAM had been testified for the preferred technique in OFDM-ROF link .",

Under such an architecture, the two paths from the source of the multicast session to the two edge routers provide certain protection for the data traffic from the source to the destination host. Two problems are associated with the proposed dual-homing multicast protection scheme. One is to calculate the individual survivability for a destination host that is connected to two edge routers. The other is to assign two edge routers for each destination host such that the total survivability is maximized for the multicast session subject to the port number constraint of edge routers. We propose an optimal algorithm to solve the first problem and a heuristic algorithm to solve the second problem. Through simulations, we show that the proposed heuristic algorithm achieves a performance close to the calculated lower bound.",

        "abstract": "C-Jun plays important roles in the development of multiple cancers, but no well-designed association studies have been conducted to assess the roles of its genetic polymorphisms in cancer risk. In a cohort of 1016 pairs of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and matched cancer-free controls, we investigated two genetic polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the c-Jun (rs4646999, -673C > T and rs2760501, -1318T > G) via the Taqman assay and evaluated the association between two polymorphisms and risk of CRC. We found that both the -1318G and -673C variant genotypes were associated with an increased risk of CRC [-1318TG: odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.54; -1318GG: OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.03-2.60; -673CT: OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.23-2.07; -673CC: OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.36-2.37]. Haplotype association analysis showed that compared with the carriers of -1318T-673T haplotype, carriers of the -1318T-673C, -1318G-673T, and -1318G-673C haplotypes all had a significantly increased risk of CRC (P < 0.05 for all). The combined genotypes incorporating both polymorphisms obtained a more significantly additive risk of CRC (one variant genotype: OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.30-2.51; two variant genotype: OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.70-3.44). Moreover, we found that the change of the -1318T to G allele interact with the -673T to C allele elevated the transcription activity of the c-Jun, and we confirmed the same trends by analyzing c-Jun protein expression in the CRC tissues from patients carrying different number of variant genotypes. This study suggests that -673C > T and -1318T > G genetic variants in c-Jun promoter regions contribute to an increased risk of CRC, possibly by elevating the transcription activity and protein expression levels that appeared to upregulate activity of c-Jun thus tumorigenesis. © The Author 2011.

Mangiterpenes A-C represent the first examples of sesquiterpene-shikimate-conjugated spirocyclic meroterpenoids, and 2',3'-seco-manginoid C features an unexpected 2',3'-seco-manginoids skeleton. Mangiterpene C strongly inhibited the production of NO inducted by LPS, with an IC value of 5.97 μM. It showed an anti-inflammatory effect by means of blocking in the NF-κB signaling pathway and decreasing the expression of inflammatory mediators.",

The third-order finite spectral ENO scheme and the fifth-order WENO-LF scheme were respectively used in the spatial discretization, and the TVD Runge-Kutta methods were employed in the time discretization. The turbulence Mach number is 0.14-0.21, and the shock Mach number is l.06-1.14. The apparent thicknesses of both the shock wave and the contact surface become larger in proportion to the turbulence Mach number, and the distortion of the contact surface is more severe than that of the shock wave. The velocity fluctuation increases behind the shock wave. When the turbulence Mach number is fixed, the amplifications of both the turbulent kinetic energy and the density fluctuation increase in proportion to the shock wave Mach number, and the increasing of the amplification of the density fluctuation is more severe than that of the amplification of the shock wave. When the shock wave Mach number is fixed, the amplifications of both the turbulent kinetic energy and the density fluctuation decrease with the increase of the turbulence Mach number, and similarly the decreasing of the amplification of the density fluctuation is more severe than that of the amplification of the shock wave.",

        "abstract": "As a major driving force for adopting cloud computing, continuous cost reduction has been constantly pursued by cloud users. For a group of users with heterogeneous cloud resource demands, it may be possible for them to buy resources in a collaborative way in order to save the purchase cost, which is known as group-buying in business. While group-buying can benefit cloud users in principle, the question is how to design an implementation scheme to support group-buying on the cloud market. In this paper, we address the question by studying a coalition formation game, aiming to design a way under which the users can form stable coalitions for group-buying. It turns out that group-buying on the cloud market is challenging in that most popular solution concepts may fail to constitute stable coalitions. In order to sustain group-buying for cloud services, we propose a new solution concept, contractually group stable, which is an extension of an existing concept in the literature. We show that this new solution concept can guarantee the existence of stable coalitions, making group-buying always possible on the cloud market. We also develop computing algorithms for solving the coalition formation game under our concept. Computational experiments show that our concept can bring in substantial cost reduction for cloud users.",

        "abstract": "Network virtualization facilitates sharing and efficient utilization of computing and bandwidth resources of an underlying substrate network. As network virtualization becomes popular, it is important to efficiently map a virtual infrastructure (VI) onto a substrate network, such that the survivability of the former can be guaranteed against failures in the latter. In this paper, we study a virtualization layer approach to survivability, whereby the virtualization layer customizes a VI request with redundant nodes and links according to its reliability requirements and then passes limited information about the augmented VI to the physical layer, where the mapping of the augmented VI takes place. More specifically, we develop a flexible scheme to enhance the original VI graph with K redundant nodes, in order to fight against an arbitrary substrate node failure. In addition, a scenario-based component group (SBCG) concept is proposed to describe resource sharing of enhanced VI requests at the physical layer. We also develop an efficient heuristic that takes advantage of the limited information on SBCG to reduce costs when mapping the enhanced VI to the substrate network. The efficiency of the proposed solution is compared using extensive simulation under various performance metrics. It is shown that the K-redundant-node scheme with SBCG information is more cost efficient than the existing 1-redundant-node solution.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Mesh Networking (WMN) is an emerging communication paradigm to enable resilient, cost-efficient and reliable services for the future-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we study the problem of multipoint-to-multipoint (M2M) multicasting in a WMN which aims to use the minimum number of time slots to exchange messages among a group of k mesh nodes in a multi-hop WMN with n mesh nodes. We study the M2M multicasting problem in a distributed environment where each participant only knows that there are k participants and it does not know who are other k-1 participants among n mesh nodes. It is known that the computation of an optimal M2M multicasting schedule isNP-hard. We present a fully distributed deterministic algorithm for such an M2M multicasting problem and analyze its time complexity. We show that if the maximum hop distance between any two out of the k participants is d, then the studied M2M multicasting problem can be solved in time O(dlog^2n+klog^3nlogk) with a polynomial-time computation, which is an almost optimal scheme due to the lower bound @W(d+klognlogk) given by Chlebus et al. (2009) [5]. Our algorithm also improves the currently best known result with running time O(dlog^2n+klog^4n) by Gasieniec et al. (2006) [13]. In this paper, we also propose a distributed deterministic algorithm which accomplishes the M2M multicasting in time O(d+k) with a polynomial-time computation in unit disk graphs. This is an asymptotically optimal algorithm in the sense that there exists a WMN topology, e.g., a line, a ring, a star or a complete graph, in which the M2M multicasting cannot be completed in less than @W(d+k) units of time.",

The two main species in [CpFe(CO)2]2 had a cis:trans molar ratio of 1.7, and showed different vibrational and rotational relaxation dynamics. Both species showed biexponential decay in their two C≡O stretching vibrational excited-state populations, with a fast component (<1 ps) and a slow component (20 ps). The former was believed to be related to the rapid dephasing processes of the coherent state caused by broadband excitation, while the latter was the typical lifetime for the C≡O stretching vibrational excited state. Having a significant permanent dipole, the cis structure could interact strongly with solvent, resulting in relatively slower rotational dynamics. Our work demonstrated that the frequency and vibrational-rotational dynamics of the non-bridged C≡O stretching vibrations were very sensitive to both molecular structures and the solvent.",

        "abstract": "Real-time detection is an important requirement of many mission-critical wireless sensor network applications such as battlefield monitoring and security surveillance. Due to the high network deployment cost, it is crucial to understand and predict the real-time detection capability of a sensor network. However, most existing real-time analyses are based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of detection. In practice, data fusion has been adopted in a number of sensor systems to deal with sensing uncertainty and enable the collaboration among sensors. However, real-time performance analysis of sensor networks designed based on data fusion has received little attention. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the fundamental real-time detection performance of large-scale sensor networks under stochastic sensing models. Our results show that data fusion is effective in achieving stringent performance requirements such as short detection delay and low false alarm rates, especially in the scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Data fusion can reduce the network density by about 60% compared with the disc model while detecting any intruder within one detection period at a false alarm rate lower than 2%. In contrast, the disc model is only suitable when the SNR is sufficiently high. Our results help understand the impact of data fusion and provide important guidelines for the design of real-time wireless sensor networks for intrusion detection.",

        "abstract": "To efficiently provide cloud storage services, most providers implement data deduplication schemes so as to reduce storage and network bandwidth consumption. Due to its broad application, many security issues about data deduplication have been investigated, such as data security, user privacy, etc. Nevertheless, we note that the threat of establishing covert channel over cloud storage has not been fully investigated. In particular, existing studies only demonstrate the potential of a single-bit channel, in which a sender can upload one of the two predefined files for a receiver to infer the information of “0” and “1”. In this paper, we design a more powerful deduplication-based covert channel that can be used to transmit a complete message. Specifically, the key features of our design include: (1) a synchronization scheme that can establish a covert channel between a sender and a receiver, and (2) a novel coding scheme that allows each file to represent multiple bits in the message. To evaluate the proposed design, we implement the covert channel and conduct extensive experiments in different cloud storage systems. Our work highlights a more severe security threat in cloud storage services.",

        "abstract": "Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) has been identified as a factor associated with poor prognosis in a range of cancers, and was reported to be mainly induced by PTEN loss in gliomas. However, the clinical effect of PD-L1 and its regulation by PTEN has not yet been determined in colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we verified the regulation of PTEN on PD-L1 and further determined the effect of PTEN on the correlation between PD-L1 expression and clinical parameters in CRC.RNA interference approach was used to down-regulate PTEN expression in SW480, SW620 and HCT116 cells. It was showed that PD-L1 protein, but not mRNA, was significantly increased in cells transfected with siRNA PTEN compared with the negative control. Moreover, the capacity of PTEN to regulate PD-L1 expression was not obviously affected by IFN-γ, the main inducer of PD-L1. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry was used to detect PD-L1 and PTEN in 404 CRC patient samples. Overexpression of PD-L1 was significantly correlated with distant metastasis (P<0.001), TNM stage (P<0.01), metastatic progression (P<0.01) and PTEN expression (P<0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that patients with high PD-L1 expression had a poor overall survival (P<0.001). However, multivariate analysis did not support PD-L1 as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.548). Univariate (P<0.001) and multivariate survival (P<0.001) analysis of 310 located CRC patients revealed that high level of PD-L1 expression was associated with increased risks of metastatic progression. Furthermore, the clinical effect of PD-L1 on CRC was not statistically significant in a subset of 39 patients with no PTEN expression (distant metastasis: P = 0.102; TNM stage: P = 0.634, overall survival: P = 0.482).PD-L1 can be used to identify CRC patients with high risk of metastasis and poor prognosis. This clinical manifestation may be partly associated with PTEN expression.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the objective clinical outcomes of active specific immunotherapy (ASI) in advanced colorectal cancer (advanced CRC) and suspected minimal residual colorectal cancer (suspected minimal residual CRC).A search was conducted on Medline and Pub Med from January 1998 to January 2010 for original studies on ASI in colorectal cancer (CRC). All articles included in this study were assessed with the application of predetermined selection criteria and were divided into two groups: ASI in advanced CRC and ASI in suspected minimal residual CRC. For ASI in suspected minimal residual CRC, a meta-analysis was executed with results regarding the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Regarding ASI in advanced colorectal cancer, a system review was performed with clinical outcomes.1375 colorectal carcinoma patients with minimal residual disease have been enrolled in Meta-analysis. A significantly improved OS and DFS was noted for suspected minimal residual CRC patients utilizing ASI (For OS: HR = 0.76, P = 0.007; For DFS: HR = 0.76, P = 0.03). For ASI in stage II suspected minimal residual CRC, OS approached significance when compared with control (HR = 0.71, P = 0.09); however, the difference in DFS of ASI for the stage II suspected minimal residual CRC reached statistical significance (HR = 0.66, P = 0.02). For ASI in stage III suspected minimal residual CRC compared with control, The difference in both OS and DFS achieved statistical significance (For OS: HR = 0.76, P = 0.02; For DFS: HR = 0.81, P = 0.03). 656 advanced colorectal patients have been evaluated on ASI in advanced CRC. Eleven for CRs and PRs was reported, corresponding to an overall response rate of 1.68%. No serious adverse events have been observed in 2031 patients.It is unlikely that ASI will provide a standard complementary therapeutic approach for advanced CRC in the near future. However, the clinical responses to ASI in patients with suspected minimal residual CRC have been encouraging, and it has become clear that immunotherapy works best in situations of patients with suspected minimal residual CRC.",

        "title": "Accuracy-aware Interference Modeling and Measurement in Wireless Sensor Networks",
        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly deployed for mission-critical applications such as emergency management and health care, which impose stringent requirements on the communication performance of WSNs. To support these applications, it is crucial to model and measure the effect of wireless interference, which is the major factor that limitsWSN performance. Accurate modeling and measurement of interference faces two key challenges. First, as shown in our experimental results, interference yields considerable spatial and temporal variations of WSN performance, which poses a major challenge for measurement at rumtime. Second, in the unlicensed band, the communication of WSN is interfered by coexisting wireless devices such as smartphones and laptops equipped with 802.11 radios, which lead to cross-technology interference that are difficult to characterize due to the heterogeneous PHY. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a novel accuracy-aware approach to interference modeling and measurement for WSNs. First, we propose a new regression-based interference model and analytically characterize its accuracy based on statistics theory. Second, we develop a novel protocol called accuracy-aware interference measurement (AIM) for measuring the proposed interference model with assured accuracy at run time. Third, building on interference modeling, we propose an algorithm that accurately forecasts the performance of WSNs in the presence of cross-technology interference. Our extensive experiments on a testbed of 17 TelosB motes show that the proposed approaches achieve high accuracy of interference modeling and WSN performance forecasting with significantly lower overhead than state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Down-regulated expression of the putative tumor suppressor gene spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is strongly associated with the development of various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). SYK gene promoter polymorphisms have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple malignant tumors. In this study, we investigated associations of SYK gene promoter polymorphisms with the susceptibility to colorectal cancer development in a Southern Han Chinese population.SNPs in the promoter region of the human SYK gene were identified using in silico analysis tools, linkage disequilibrium analysis, and a search for likely transcription factor binding sites via TFSEARCH in the NCBI SNP database (gene ID: 6850). Based on this information, -803A &amp;gt; T and -534T &amp;gt; C were selected as candidates for further analysis. TaqMan-MGB probe analyses were performed in 567 CRC patients and 569 age- and gender-matched healthy controls for SYK gene promoter genotyping. Associations between CRC risk and SNPs were estimated using an unconditional logistic regression model, and environmental risk factors were included in a multivariate logistic regression model for correction.The frequencies of the TA and TT genotypes and the T allele of the -803A &amp;gt; T SNP were found to be significantly higher in the CRC patients compared to the healthy individuals of the control group (P = 0.020, 0.023, and 0.013, respectively). Synergistic effects between -803A &amp;gt; T genotypes (i.e., TA + TT) and age (≤60 years; P = 0.039), male gender (P = 0.011), smoking (P = 0.005), drinking alcohol (P = 0.002), and high BMI (≥24.0 kg/m(2); P = 0.009) were found to increase the risk to develop CRC by stratified analyses.The SYK -803 A &amp;gt; T genotypes TA and TT are independent risk factors for CRC development in Han Chinese in Southern China, and an association with TA + TT genotypes appears predominant among younger patients, male patients, patients with a high BMI, and patients who smoke or drink alcohol.",

The core of TC-MPCMs was comprised of crystal violet lactone employed as thermochromic colorant, bisphenol A as developer and 1-tetradecanol as co-solvent, respectively. The effects of shell materials on reversible thermochromic properties, thermal performance and thermal stability of TC-MPCMs were investigated systematically as well. These influencing factors of encapsulation process such as the dripping speeds, SMA emulsifier and pH were carried out to optimize the encapsulation parameters. Additionally, the TC-MPCMs modified with fabricated silver nano-particles displayed excellent thermal properties, heat transfer and antibacterial activity. Both the microscopic morphology and microstructure of TC-MPCMs were characterized and discussed systematically. The thermal distribution on the TC-MPCMs was exhibited via the infrared camera. The performance of fusion, crystallization, enthalpy and thermal stability of various capsules were measured and studied as well. In the end, ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry was employed to investigate the antibacterial activity of Ag-TC-MPCMs(B). Furthermore, the TC-MPCMs(B) and Ag-TC-MPCMs(B) exhibited excellent thermal stability and the cyclic durability.",

        "abstract": "The Langshan orogenic belt, located in the western part of northern margin of North China Platform, has experienced a long tectonic evolution and development process, which includes: (1) the formation of its crystalline basement in Neoarchean and deformation in Early Proterozoic; (2) the break-up, deposition and closure of its passive continental margin aulacogen in Mesoproterozoic; (3) the begining of its continental margin activities in late Neo-Proterozoic; (4) the development of compression and orogeny from Hercynian to Mesozoic with considerable intrusion of acid-intermediate magma. Abundant Zn, Pb, Cu, Fe, Au minerals occurred in the Langshan orogenic belt. The types, scales and the regulations of temporal and spatial distribution of these ore deposits show a close coupling relationship with ore-forming geological setting and tectonic evolution, and different deposits were formed in each stage of tectonic evolution in Langshan orogenic belt (as follows) : (1) the hydrothermal sedimentary banded-iron formation (BIF) deposits were formed in submarine volcanic environment in Neoarchean; (2) the submarine exhalative-sedimentary lead-zinc-copper-iron sulfide deposits, related to the break-up process of the Langshan passive continental margin aulacogen, were formed in the Mesoproterozoic; (3) the middle-small sized porphyry copper-gold deposits were formed by the magmatic-hydrothermal activities, related to the process of compression and orogeny of Hercynian to Mesozoic. They were superimposed on the exhalative-sedimentary deposits of Mesoproterozoic and gave apparent modification to the latters. But parts of the Dongshengmiao, Tanyaokou and Hougoqi copper deposits were formed by the magmatic-hydrothermal process in the later orogeny.",

Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) combines endoscopic technique with transanal approach, and solves the problem of surgery exposure in lower rectal cancer. It has become an option for colorectal surgeons in lower rectal cancer. We named this operation as transanal endoscopic surgery, for the appropriateness when it is applied for other colorectal diseases. Transanal endoscopic surgery belongs to the category of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, which achieves the same pathological outcomes with less invasiveness and better organ functions compared with traditional surgery.

        "abstract": "To efficiently archive and query data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), distributed storage systems, and multisink schemes have been proposed recently. However, such distributed access cannot be fully supported and exploited by existing routing protocols in a large-scale WSN. In this paper, we will address this challenging issue and propose a distributed geographic $(K)$-anycast routing (GKAR) protocol for WSNs, which can efficiently route data from a source sensor to any $(K)$ destinations (e.g., storage nodes or sinks). To guarantee $(K)$-delivery, an iterative approach is adopted in GKAR where in each round, GKAR will determine not only the next hops at each node, but also a set of potential destinations for every next hop node to reach. Efficient algorithms are designed to determine the selection of the next hops and destination set division at each intermediate node. We analyze the complexity of GKAR in each round and we also theoretically analyze the expected number of rounds required to guarantee $(K)$-delivery. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the GKAP scheme in reducing the total duration and the communication overhead for finding $(K)$ destinations, by comparing with the existing schemes, e.g., $(K 1)$-anycast [10].",

Here, we designed support vector machine (SVM) model to address this issue by integrating epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-related biomarkers along with clinicopathological variables.Using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry, the EMT-related biomarkers expression was measured in 193 RC patients. Of which, 74 patients were assigned to the training set to select the robust variables for designing SVM model. The SVM model predictive value was validated in the testing set (119 patients).In training set, eight variables, including six EMT-related biomarkers and two clinicopathological variables, were selected to devise SVM model. In testing set, we identified 63 patients with high risk to RLNM and 56 patients with low risk. The sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of SVM in predicting RLNM were 68.3%, 81.1% and 72.3%, respectively. Importantly, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that SVM model was indeed an independent predictor of RLNM status (odds ratio, 11.536; 95% confidence interval, 4.113-32.361; P<0.0001).Our SVM-based model displayed moderately strong predictive power in defining the RLNM status in RC patients, providing an important approach to select RLNM high-risk subgroup for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the role of smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of cancer, and body mass index (BMI) in sporadic colorectal cancer in southern Chinese.A hospital-based case-control study was conducted from July 2002 to December 2008. There were 706 cases and 723 controls with their sex and age (within 5 years) matched. An unconditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of cancer, BMI and sporadic colorectal cancer.No positive association was observed between smoking status and sporadic colorectal cancer risk. Compared with the non alcohol drinkers, the current and former alcohol drinkers had an increased risk of developing sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) (adjusted OR = 8.61 and 95% CI = 6.15-12.05; adjusted OR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.27-4.17). Moreover, the increased risk of developing sporadic CRC was significant in those with a positive family history of cancer (adjusted OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.12-3.34) and in those with their BMI >or= 24.0 kg/m(2) (adjusted OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10-1.75). Stratification analysis showed that the risk of developing both colon and rectal cancers was increased in current alcohol drinkers (adjusted OR = 7.60 and 95% CI = 5.13-11.25; adjusted OR = 7.52 and 95% CI = 5.13-11.01) and in those with their BMI >or= 24.0 kg/m(2) (adjusted OR = 1.38 and 95% CI = 1.04-1.83; adjusted OR = 1.35 and 95% CI = 1.02-1.79). The risk of developing colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, was found in former alcohol drinkers and in those with a positive family history of cancer (adjusted OR = 2.51 and 95% CI = 1.24-5.07; adjusted OR = 1.82 and 95% CI = 1.17-2.82).Alcohol drinking, high BMI (>or= 24.0 kg/m(2)) and positive family history of cancer are the independent risk factors for colorectal cancer in southern Chinese.",

        "abstract": "A series of 3- and 2-dimensional numerical simulations of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) are carried out with a 1-step chemical reaction model to investigate the RDE's propulsive performance. First, the performance is computed by a 3-dimensional simulation. After the initial instability dies down, the specific impulse and mass flux of RDE converge to constant values. Then, some simplified 2-dimensional cases are simulated. The following propulsive performance collusions are obtained: with the injection stagnation pressure increases, the mass flux increases linearly and the specific impulse decreases a little. With combustor length larger than a special value, specific impulse and mass flux change a little. The propulsive parameters obtained from the 3-dimensional simulation case agree with simplified 2-dimensional simulation cases. Copyright © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

        "title": "Anonymous communication with network coding against traffic analysis attack.",
        "abstract": "Flow untraceability is one critical requirement for anonymous communication with network coding, which prevents malicious attackers with wiretapping and traffic analysis abilities from relating the senders to the receivers, using linear dependency of the received packets. There have recently been proposals advocating encryptions on the Global Encoding Vectors (GEV) of network coding to thwart such attacks [1], [2]. Nevertheless, there has been no exploration of the capability of networking coding itself, to constitute more efficient and effective algorithms which guarantee anonymity. In this paper, we design a novel, simple, and effective linear network coding mechanism (ALNCode) to achieve flow untraceability in a communication network with multiple unicast flows. With solid theoretical analysis, we first show that linear network coding (LNC) can be applied to thwart traffic analysis attacks without the need of encrypting GEVs. Our key idea is to mix multiple flows at their intersection nodes by generating downstream GEVs from the common basis of upstream GEVs belonging to multiple flows, in order to hide the correlation of upstream and downstream GEVs in each flow. We then design a deterministic LNC scheme to implement our idea, by which the downstream GEVs produced are guaranteed to obfuscate their correlation with the corresponding upstream GEVs. We also give extensive theoretical analysis on the intersection probability of GEV bases and the influential factors to the effectiveness of our scheme, as well as the algorithm complexity to support its efficiency. © 2011 IEEE.",

        "title": "A study of stable isotope geochemistry of the Jiawula large Pb-Zn-Ag ore deposit, Inner Mongolia",
        "abstract": "Located in the northern part of the Da Hinggan Mountain metallogenic belt, the Jiawula deposit is a large Pb-Zn-Ag polymetallic ore deposit which was discovered in recent years. Ore body is totally controlled by fault structure and the main metallic minerals are galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, arseno-pyrite, molybdenite, magnetite, etc. In this paper, the author analyzed geochemistry of sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and lead isotopes of the deposit. The study indicated that the δ34S(‰) values range from 1.37 to 4.10‰ with an average of 3.10‰ (n=13); that the (δ18 Owater (‰) values range from -18.96 to +1.08‰ (n=9) with an average of - 11.36‰; that the δDV-SMOW(‰) values range from -133.6 to -103.4‰ (n=9); that the 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb values of 27 samples range 18.228 3-18.758 7, 15.457-15.880 and 37.841 - 39.049, respectively, and the lead isotope compositions showed that all the lead belong to normal radiogenic lead; that the δ13CV-EDB(‰) values range from -5.2 to -8.4‰ with an average of -6.8‰ (n=2). The sulfur and carbon isotope data suggested that the ore forming fluids were mainly derived from the deep magmatic fluids and the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions indicated that the ore forming fluids were composed of magmatic fluids in the early stage and of meteoric water in the late stage. The lead isotopic compositions confirmed that the origin of lead in the deposit was mainly from mantle source as well as little from crust source. All the isotopic compositions demonstrated that the formation of the Jiawula large Pb-Zn-Ag deposit was associated with the volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal activities in the late Yanshanian period and the addition of meteoric water within the magmatic fluids created a favorable condition for the metallogenic elements to accumulate and precipitate to form such a large deposit. The occurrence of mineralization was under a low δ34S∑s, medium oxidation state, relatively open and non-equilibrium system. Geodynamic settings of the mineralization were under a process of huge lithosphere thinning. The genetic type of the Jiawula deposit can be regarded as the volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal vein Pb-Zn-Ag ore deposit.",

The main views were as follows. 1) Ore grosses were estimated by the meteorolite sport and numerical value of the clash-magnetism, and occurrence of ore body was ascertained on the basis of the clash-magnetism vector. 2) Test and verify of the clash-magnetism and elements ascertains could decide the metallogenetic epoch. 3) Continual medium mechanics and grosses conservation of the clash-magnetism controlled the enrichment of the metallogenetic elements. The huge clash-magnetism vector related to Fe-Co-Ni element's enrichment of high temperature magma deposit. 4) The continental clash-magnetism resulted in many kind of liquids, and controlled the enrichment of combining elements. The clash-magnetism caused the element combination of high temperature in the meteorolite body, and the element combination of low temperature in the wall rocks. 5) The shear effect of the continental clash-magnetism controlled the element's enriching. The direction of perpendicular to the clash-magnetism might be favorable to the ore-forming element's enrichment. In addition, the total effect of the clash-magnetism, strain speed and magnetization rate controlled the lateral distribution of many ore-forming elements.

Objective: To investigate the ratio of bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the resin matrix, and solid glass bead effects on flexural strength and polymerization shrinkage rate of oral composite resin. Methods: Solid glass beads were siliconized by silane coupling agent KH-550. Solid glass beads at mass fraction of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% were added into the oral composite resin containing bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate at a ratio of 7/3, 6/4, and 5/5, respectively. After mechanical stirring, the mixture filled the mold for solidification. Non-solid glass bead resin served as control. Mechanical properties and shrinkage rate were analyzed. Results and Conclusion: With the increasing addition of solid glass beads, the flexural strength was increased first and then decreased, and polymerization shrinkage rate tended to be declined. The highest flexural strength was (88.29±0.66) MPa (P < 0.05), when bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate were mixed at a ratio of 5/5 and the addition amount of solid glass beads was 70%. The minimal polymerization shrinkage rate was 0.898%, when bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate were mixed at a ratio of 7/3 and the addition amount of solid glass beads was 70%.",

        "abstract": "Video on demand (VoD) is one of the most important services for many network operators that deploy and operate optical access networks. It is crucial to design next generation optical access networks that can guarantee a high quality VoD service. In this paper, we address this challenging issue and focus on the worst-case playback delay (WPD), which cannot be guaranteed by Internet-based video streaming, and has not been well addressed previously in optical access networks. Specifically, we first propose an integrated Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) and Wavelength Division Multiplexing PON (WDM PON) architecture. With the proposed architecture, an optical line terminal (OLT) can broadcast popular videos through GPON and deliver other videos through WDM-PON, while the optical network units (ONUs) can conduct patching for their end users. We then elaborate on two minimum-WPD schemes. In the first one, we assume that the video broadcast schedule is fixed at the OLT and develop an optimal patching scheme at each ONU such that the WPD is minimized. In the second one, we consider coordinated OLT broadcast scheduling and ONU patching. A heuristic algorithm which can achieve near-optimal WPD is proposed for coordinated OLT broadcast scheduling and ONU patching. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed schemes over the existing ones in terms of both worstcase and average delay performance.",

In this paper, we propose several generalizations of CTC(N), including SCTC(N, n) (sparse CTC), SMCTC(N, n) (sparse multi-layer CTC) and MSCTC(N, n) (multi-layer sparse CTC). Through analysis and simulations, we show that these generalizations maintain the same performance of their counterparts CTC(N) and MCTC(N), while reducing the cost from O(N2) to O(N log N).",

The purpose of this work was to assess the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with gastric cancer.We searched systematically electronic through the databases of PUBMED, EMBASE, China Biological Medicine, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Whole Article for studies published from 1975. Two reviewers independently evaluated the relevant reports and searched manually reference from these reports for additional trials. Outcomes assessed by meta-analysis included overall survival rate, progression-free survival rate, R0 resection rate, downstaging effect, postoperative complications, and perioperative mortality.Six randomized, controlled trials with 781 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Odds ratio (95% confidence interval; P-value), expressed as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery versus surgery alone, was 1.16 (0.85-1.58; P = 0.36) for overall survival, 1.24 (0.78-1.96; P = 0.36) for R0 resection, 1.25 (0.75-2.09; P = 0.39) for postoperative complications, and 3.60 (0.59-22.45; P = 0.17) for perioperative mortality.Compared with surgery alone, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery was not associated with a higher rate of overall survival or complete resection (R0 resection). It does not increase treatment-related morbidity and mortality. This meta-analysis did not demonstrate a survival benefit for the combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery.",

        "abstract": "Supercooling of micro- and nanoencapsulated phase change material is widely observed as their diameters depress to a limitation upon cooling. The aim of this study is to suppress the supercooling of nanoencapsulated n-octadecane (NanoC18) using a novel copolymer consisting of long n-alkyl side chains as shell. Nanoencapsulations of n-octadecane with various compositions of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-octadecyl methacrylate) copolymer as shells were carried out by means of miniemulsion polymerization. Fabrication, morphology, diameter distributions, phase change behaviours, and thermal stabilities of nanocapsules were investigated using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, a field-emission scanning electron microscope, a transmission electron microscope, particle size distribution analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicate that a series of nanocapsules with core/shell structure and spherical shapes are fabricated with average diameters ranging from 373 to 398 nm. The average thickness of the shells is about 60 nm. All the NanoC18 crystallize into a stable triclinic phase via a metastable rotator phase (RI) from the liquid phase. The crystallization temperature of n-octadecane within poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocapsules is considerably lower than that in bulk phase. Supercooling is effectively suppressed using the comb-like copolymer with crystallizable n-octadecyl side chains as shell. Octadecyl methacrylate is not only employed as a reactive costabilizer to suppress the influence of Ostwald ripening during the formation of nanocapsules but also as a functional monomer in the composition of the copolymer shell in order to suppress the supercooling of NanoC18. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

BIACORE 3000 SPR instrument and a dextran-modified sensor chip (CM5) were used. After activation with EDC/NHS, anti-E. coli O157 : H7 antibody was immobilized on the gold surface of the SPR sensor, and then following ethanolamine was injected, and the chip was ready for E. coli O157 : H7. Regeneration was achieved using NaOH in order to detect several samples. The limit of detection was found to be 3 x 10(5) CFU x mL(-1) for E. coli O157 : H7, and the change of RU was linearly correlated with the concentration of E. coli O157 : H7 cells (R2 = 0.99). The detection time ranged from 5 to 7 min, and the result of regeneration was effective which allowed the chip to be reused for more than 50 samples. This method is convenient, and stable, and shows potentials for applications in food areas.",

It is intimately accompanied by galenite, Ag-tetrahedrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and boulangerite. Falkmanite crystals show as needle, pillar, prismatic, hair-like, bunchiness and anhedral grain forms, and its grain sizescommonly vary from 0.05 to 4 mm, even to 12 mm. The mineral is lightly grey-white in colour, metallic in lustur and brashy, 93.25 to 127.39 kg/mm2, averaging 111.05 kg/mm for 100 g load in microhardness and Moh's=3.06~3.40. Electron microprobe analyses of seven points in the falkmanite gave thecompositional results as followings(%): Pb 52.20~57.80 (54.89 on average), Sb 22.26~28.13 (26.08 on average), S 18.65~19.62 (19.01 on average), and minor contents of Fe, Cu, Zn, Ag and As, corresponding to the formula (Pb4.91, Cu0.04, Fe0.03, Zn0.01)4.99 (Sb3.97, As0.04)4.01 S11.00, and its simplified formula Pb5Sb4S11. The crystals are monoclinic, with cell dimensions a 2.156, b 2.349, c 0.810 nm. The formation of falkmanite would be favored by a low temperature, increasing f S2 and reduced fluid conditions during polymetallic mineralization.",

At 38 weeks of age, 780 female and 156 male duck breeders were fed either regular or high vitamin premix diet (maternal high premix had higher levels of all vitamins except K than maternal regular premix) for 16 weeks. Ducklings hatched from eggs laid at the end of the duck breeder trial were kept separate according to maternal treatment and were fed 2 levels of vitamin premix (NRC and high, progeny high premix had higher levels of all vitamins except biotin than progeny NRC premix) for 35 days. Body weight (<0.001) and tibia ash (=0.033) of 1-day-old ducklings and serum total superoxide dismutase activity of 14-day-old ducklings (=0.027) were increased by maternal high vitamin premix. Progeny high vitamin premix increased body weight (14 days, =0.019; 35 days, =0.034), body weight gain (1-14 days, =0.021; 1-35 days, =0.034), gain:feed ratio (1-14 days, <0.001), feed intake (15-35 days, =0.037), serum total antioxidant capacity (14 days, =0.048; 35 days, =0.047), and serum calcium (14 days, =0.007), and decreased serum malondialdehyde (14 days, =0.038; 35 days, =0.031) of ducklings. Maternal vitamin premix-progeny vitamin premix interaction significantly affected body weight (14 days, =0.029), body weight gain (1-14 days, =0.029), and feed intake (1-14 days, =0.018) of progeny ducklings. Briefly, progeny NRC premix decreased the growth performance (days 1-14) of ducklings from maternal regular vitamin group, but not duckling from maternal high vitamin group. The results demonstrate a shortcoming of current vitamin recommendations for ducklings and suggest that the vitamin needs of starter ducklings can be met by either maternal or progeny vitamin supplementation.",

        "abstract": "Objective By studying the subcellular localization of Syk(L)in breast cancer cells and the mechanism of its nuclear translocation,explore the possible mechanism of Syk(L)tumor suppression function.Methods Cytosolic and nuclear fractionation experiments were used to separate the cytosolic and nuclear cell lysate of breast cancer cell lines BT474.Western blot was used to analyze the subcellular localization of Syk.Green fluoresent protein(GFP)and Syk(L)nuclear translocation domain fusion proteins were constructed and transfected into Cos 7 cells.The subcellular localization of fusion proteins were observed under fluorescence microscope.Results Both Syk(S)and Syk(L)was found in the cytosolic extracts of breast cancer cell BT474,while only Syk(L)was found in the nuclear extracts.GFP and Syk(L)'s deletion(DEL)domain fusion protein was observed expressing in the cells evenly.Fused IDB domain of Syk(L)was able to transport GFP into nucleus and congregated in the nuecleus.When the basic amino acids 294K,300K and 305K in the DEL domain were mutated to non-basic amino acids asparagine,the mutated GFP-IDB(L)fusion protein lost the ability of nuclear congregation.Conclusions Syk(L)is able to translocate to nucleus from cytoplasm in breast cancer cell.The IDB domain of Syk(L)has complete nuclear translocalization function,which is able to transport cytoplasm protein GFP into nucleus.The basic amino acids in DEL domain of Syk(L)contains nuclear localization signal.Syk(L)tumor suppression function is possiblely associated with its nuclear translocation.",

        "title": "Read More with Less: An Adaptive Approach to Energy-Efficient RFID Systems",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the wide adoption of the RFID technology in many important application domains including logistics, inventory, retailing, public transportation, and security. Though RFID tags (transponders) can be passive, the high power consumption of RFID readers (interrogators) has become a critical issue as handheld and mobile readers are increasingly available in pervasive computing environments. Moreover, high transmission power aggravates interference, complicating the deployment and operation of RFID systems. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient RFID inventory algorithm called Automatic Power Stepping (APS). The design of APS is based on extensive empirical study on passive tags, and takes into consideration several important details such as tag response states and variable slot lengths. APS dynamically estimates the number of tags to be read, incrementally adjusts the transmission power level to use sufficient but not excessive power for communication, and consequently reduces both the energy consumption for reading a set of tags and the possibility of collisions. We design APS to be compatible with the current Class-1 Generation-2 RFID standards so that a reader running APS can interact with existing commercial tags without modification. We have implemented APS both on an NI RFID testing platform and in a high-fidelity simulator. The evaluation shows that APS can save more than 60% energy used by RFID readers while maintaining comparable performance on the read rate.",

All the structures were established based on extensive spectroscopic analyses, including HRESIMS and NMR data. The chiral chromatography analyses allowed the separation of (±)-asperteretones A-D, whose absolute configurations were further confirmed by experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) analysis. Structurally, compounds - represented the first examples of prenylated γ-butenolides bearing 2-phenyl-3-benzyl-4-furan-1-one motifs, and their crucial biogenetically related metabolite, compound , was uniquely defined by an unexpected cleavage of oxygen bridge between C-1 and C-4. Importantly, (±)-asperteretal D and (4)-4-decarboxylflavipesolide C were revised to (±)-asperteretones B (/) and D (), respectively. Additionally, compounds  and  were evaluated for the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and all these compounds exhibited potent inhibitory potency against α-glucosidase, with IC values ranging from 15.7 ± 1.1 to 53.1 ± 1.4 μM, which was much lower than that of the positive control acarbose (IC = 154.7 ± 8.1 μM), endowing them as promising leading molecules for the discovery of new α-glucosidase inhibitors for type-2 diabetes mellitus treatment.",

        "abstract": "Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising way to efficiently use the massive bandwidth in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks. However, the problem of contention between bursts is hard to be solved in OBS networks with general topology. For that reason, the conception of contention-free OBS ring is proposed. In recent years, several OBS ring schemes have been designed. According to the number of transceivers installed at each node, the schemes can be roughly divided into two classes: single-transceiver schemes and multi-transceivers schemes. Among which, multi-transceivers schemes are more efficient than single-transceiver ones. There are two existing multi-transceivers schemes, LightRing and SWING, yet both of them have disadvantages. The LightRing scheme has a high queuing delay and needs large buffers, while the SWING scheme not only needs a large number of fiber delay lines but also has a specific requirement to the girth of the ring. In this paper, we design another multi-transceivers OBS ring scheme named irregularly slotted OBS ring (IS-OBS-Ring). In the IS-OBS-Ring scheme, all data wavelengths are slotted and slots on different wavelengths are not synchronously but irregularly distributed. Simulation results show that the performance of IS-OBS-Ring is further better than the LightRing scheme and similar to the SWING scheme. However, the IS-OBS-Ring scheme can overcome the disadvantages of both the LightRing scheme and the SWING scheme.",

The postoperative total complications, pelvic abscess, anastomotic leak, sexual dysfunction and defecation dysfunction were similar in both groups. There was no reasonably clear evidence in favor of lateral node dissection for recurrence, local recurrence, distal metastasis and 5-year survival.Lateral node dissection can neither reduce recurrence nor improve survival in the current study, which is not recommended to be a routine procedure in rectal cancer surgery.",

        "abstract": "Protecting networking infrastructures from malicious attacks is important as a successful attack on a high data rate link can cause the loss or delay of large amounts of data. In this paper, we consider a proactive approach where the ISPs are willing to allocate some (limited) resources to defend the networking infrastructures against the attacks. We aim to answer where and how much the defending resource should be placed so that the expected data loss can be minimized no matter where the attacker may launch the attack. We model the problem as a 2-player zero-sum game where the payoffs are measured by the maximum network flow. In order to overcome the unique challenges of such payoffs, we transform the payoffs into explicit piece-wise functions through multi-parametric linear programming (MP-LP) and divide the entire strategy space into a set of critical regions. We prove that a global Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists when there is only one critical region. However, when the number of critical regions is greater than 1, there is no global NE. We also prove that there exists one and only one local NE in each critical region. We then design a mixed-strategy solution. Our results have shown that to dedicate all defending resources to one min-cut set when there are multiple min-cut sets will not be an optimal solution, however, min-cut strategies will have higher probabilities to be selected in the mixed-strategy solution when the defending resource is limited.",

In particular, NFV provides an efficient way to deploy network services using SFCs that consist of a set of VNFs interconnected by virtual links. A practical but theoretically challenging problem related to NFV management and orchestration is how to jointly optimize the topology design and mapping of multiple SFCs such that the TBC is minimized, which is called the JTDM problem. In this article, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm, Closed-Loop with Critical Mapping Feedback, to efficiently address the JTDM problem. While minimizing the TBC, we also propose scalable and reliable JTDM strategies that can significantly reduce the network reconfigurations and enhance the service reliability, respectively.",

        "abstract": "As a potential pandemic threat to human health, there has been an urgent need for rapid detection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) H5N1 virus. In this study, magnetic nanobeads amplification based quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor was developed as a new method and application for AI H5N1 virus detection. Polyclonal antibodies against AI H5N1 virus surface antigen HA (Hemagglutinin) were immobilized on the gold surface of the QCM crystal through self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA). Target H5N1 viruses were then captured by the immobilized antibodies, resulting in a change in the frequency. Magnetic nanobeads (diameter, 30nm) coated with anti-H5 antibodies were used for further amplification of the binding reaction between antibody and antigen (virus). Both bindings of target H5N1 viruses and magnetic nanobeads onto the crystal surface were further confirmed by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The QCM immunosensor could detect the H5N1 virus at a titer higher than 0.0128 HA unit within 2h. The nanobeads amplification resulted in much better detection signal for target virus with lower titers. The response of the antibody-antigen (virus) interaction was shown to be virus titer-dependent, and a linear correlation between the logarithmic number of H5N1 virus titers and frequency shift was found from 0.128 to 12.8 HA unit. No significant interference was observed from non-target subtypes such as AI subtypes H3N2, H2N2, and H4N8. The immunosensor was evaluated using chicken tracheal swab samples. This research demonstrated that the magnetic nanobeads amplification based QCM immunosensor has a great potential to be an alternative method for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of AI virus H5N1 in agricultural, food, environmental and clinical samples.",

        "abstract": "The nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR/p75) is a potential tumor suppressor, but its role in colorectal cancer is unknown. Here, the hypermethylation status, biologic function, and clinical relevance were determined for p75NGFR in colorectal cancer. The methylation status and expression of p75NGFR were assessed in colorectal cancer cell lines and clinical tissues by bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS), qRT-PCR, and immunoblot assay. Methylation of p75NGFR was frequently found in colorectal cancer, leading to its silencing or downregulation, and it was effectively restored by a demethylation agent. The overexpression of p75NGFR in multiple colorectal cancer cell model systems significantly inhibited cell proliferation (concomitant with G1-phase arrest), invasion, and colony formation and induced cell apoptosis. In contrast, p75NGFR knockdown significantly promoted proliferative and invasive phenotypes. Importantly, p75NGFR methylation was observed in the majority of primary colorectal cancer specimens and was associated with histologic grade and preoperative serum CA19-9 levels. Multivariate analysis indicated that patients who lack p75NGFR have reduced overall survival (64% vs. 75%, P = 0.028) and disease-free survival (61% vs. 72%, P = 0.034) compared with p75NGFR-positive patients. In conclusion, p75NGFR is predominantly silenced or downregulated in colorectal cancer, and its biologic activities are consistent with it being a relevant tumor suppressor.p75NGFR is a candidate tumor suppressor and has independent prognostic potential in colorectal cancer.",

The detonation wave, the deflagration wave, the oblique shock wave, and the contact surface have a small influence on the paths of flow particles. The fluctuation of paths in the azimuthal direction is less than 12% of the circumference of the combustion chamber. The path will deflect when the flow particle encounters the detonation wave or the oblique shock wave, and it will not deflect when encounters the deflagration wave or the contact surface. About 23.6% fuel is burned by deflagration, and the left is burned by rotating detonation wave. The thermodynamic performance of continuously rotating detonations is then discussed. The p- v and T- s diagrams obtained by numerical simulation are qualitatively consistent with the ideal ZND model. The average thermal efficiency of the detonation combustion in 2D RDE is 31%, and its average net mechanical work is 1.3. MJ/kg. The thermal efficiency of the entire RDE is 26.4%, and its net mechanical work is 30% of the ideal ZND model. The superior performance of continuously rotating detonations is determined. © 2012.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a large cooperative wireless network with relay nodes, in which cooperation is enabled through physical-layer network coding (PLNC). Specifically, we study the impact of the relay selection on the network capacity with power constraints in two scenarios. First, we consider the basic PLNC model (a.k.a., the ARB model), in which one pair of source nodes (A, B) exchange messages via a selected relay node (R). Given the power constraint, we derive the optimal relay selection and power allocation that maximize the sum capacity, defined as the summation of the capacity for two source-destination channels. Based on results obtained above, we then consider a more general scenario with multiple pairs of source nodes. Assuming the constant power constraint, we derive the upper bound of the minimal sum capacity of any source pair. The optimal power allocation among multiple source pairs is also derived. To validate these theoretical results, we also provide two relay selection strategies: a modified optimal relay assignment strategy and a novel middle point strategy for maximizing the minimal sum capacity of any source pair.",

Upon entry the study, they received 4 cycles of chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen. Radiotherapy was added from the second cycle of chemotherapy (CT). The total dose of radiotherapy (RT) was 46 Gy (2 Gy x 23). Total mesorectal excision (TME) was performed 4-8 weeks after RT.Among them, 54 cases received 4 cycles of CT, 1 patient stopped CT after the second cycle of CT because of unrecovery from neutropenia. One patient stopped chemoradiotherapy(CRT) because of complicating with active pulmonary tuberculosis after 2 cycles of CT and 10 times of RT. Two occurred liver, lung and bone metastases after CT. Totally 220 cycles of CT were administrated. Fifty-two patients received operation after CRT, 50 with anal interior sphincter reservation, 19 with prophylactic ileac stoma. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 2 patients after operation, and rectal vaginal fistula in 2 patients 1 month after operation. According to the pathologic results, 7 patients achieved complete response, 41 partial response, 4 stable disease, and the objective response rate was 85.7%.Concomitant treatment of FOLFOX regimen and RT in neoadjuvant setting of rectal cancer was safe and tolerable, and it suggests that protective ileostomy for anastomotic leakage following anus-preserving operation should be performed.",

Microencapsulated PCMs, i.e. the PCMs enclosed in micron-sized shells, have been studied extensively as a route to avoid PCM leakage and facilitate their applications. In this study, a series of microencapsulated bio-based n-dodecanol with various surface morphologies were synthesized through in situ polymerization. The microencapsulation mechanism and microstructure evolution under varying factors such as precursor concentration, emulsifying condition and resin ratio were investigated via ex situ field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). In particular, the surface morphology, particle size and dispersion of microcapsules were analyzed systematically. The self-polymerized nanoparticles located on the surface of the microcapsules could be regulated, and their formation mechanism was also determined. In addition, the regulation parameters of microencapsulation could also be beneficial for the further rational design of microcapsules, and are expected to expand their application to wider fields.",

        "abstract": "The InGaN-based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with dip-shaped quantum wells (QWs) and conventional QWs were fabricated by MOVPE. The performances of fabricated InGaN-based LEDs were investigated experimentally and analyzed theoretically. The results reveal that the efficiency droop of InGaN-based LED is suppressed by using dip-shaped QWs structure. Firstly, the dip-shaped QWs LED has higher emission intensity compared with the conventional QWs LED due to the stronger quantum confinement and weaker polarization effect. Furthermore, the effective combination region in dip-shaped QWs does not reduce obviously which decrease will lead to efficiency droop aggravation. As a result, the efficiency droop at 50 A cm−2 injection current for dip-shaped QWs LED reduce from 59% for conventional QWs LED to 48%. So, the dip-shaped QWs can be used to suppress the efficiency droop of InGaN-based LEDs.",

Data fusion has been shown as an effective technique for improving system detection performance by enabling efficient collaboration among sensors with limited sensing capability. Due to the high cost of network deployment, it is desirable to place sensors at optimal locations to achieve maximum detection performance. However, for sensor networks employing data fusion, optimal sensor placement is a non-linear optimizationproblem with prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we present fast sensor placement algorithms based on a probabilistic data fusion model.Simulation results show that our algorithms can meet the desired detection performance with a small number of sensors while achieving up to 7-fold speedup over the optimal algorithm.",

        "abstract": "NC (Network Coding) provides a new approach to packet retransmission problems in wireless networks, which are named as WPRTPs (Wireless Packet Retransmission Problems) in this paper. Some research has been conducted on P-WPRTPs (Perfect WPRTPs) where, for one receiver, a packet is either being requested by or already known to it. However, very few efforts are focused on IP-WPRTPs (Imperfect WPRTPs) where, for one receiver, a packet can be neither requested by nor already known to it. In this paper, we focus on IP-WPRTPs. Firstly, a WPRTP reduction theorem for simplifying WPRTPs is proposed and proved. Then, the upper and lower bounds of the number of necessary packet transmissions in optimal NC-based solutions to IP-WPRTPs are analyzed. Next, a scheme named as IP-WPRTP-DC (Divide and Conquer based scheme for IP-WPRTPs) is proposed based on the WPRTP reduction theorem using a divide and conquer approach. Extensive simulations show that the IP-WPRTP-DC scheme is effective in saving the number of packet transmissions for solving IP-WPRTPs.",

        "abstract": "The ability to accurately track pedestrians is valuable for various application designs. Although pedestrian tracking has been investigated extensively and owns a well-suited sensing platform, the proposed solutions are far from being mature yet. Pedestrian tracking contains step counting and stride estimation two components. Step counting already has commercial products, but the performance is still unreliable and less trustworthy in practice. Stride estimation even stays in the research stage without ready solutions released on the market. Such a non-negligible gap between the long-term research investigation and technique's actual usage exists due to a series of crucial applicability issues unsolved, including design's vulnerability to interfering activities, extracting purely body's movement from mixed sensor signals, and parameter training without user's intervention. In this paper, we deeply analyze human's gait cycles and obtain inspiring observations to address these issues. We incorporate our techniques into existing pedestrian tracking designs and implement a prototype, PTrack, on LG smartwatch. We find that PTrack effectively enhances the system applicability and achieves promising performance under very practical settings.",

As mobile nodes generally have more power than static nodes, they are preferable to be used as cluster heads. In this paper, we study the mobile node deployment problem with the objective of maximizing the number of static nodes covered by the mobile nodes with minimized moving distance. We prove that this problem is NP-complete and propose a distributed deployment protocol to solve it. In the proposed protocol, different policies of selecting the moving nodes are considered to cover more static nodes with less moving distance. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves high coverage ratio with acceptable moving distance.",

Previous research has also shown that intolerance of uncertainty is one important factor that contributes to symptoms of generalized anxiety. A research question then emerges: do individuals with generalized anxiety pay particular attention to negative stimuli under uncertain situations? Little research has been conducted to answer this question. Consequently, the present research aims at demonstrating the attentional bias of individuals with generalized anxiety. Using the dot-probe task paradigm, two experiments were conducted to examine the attentional bias of individuals with generalized anxiety under ordinary versus uncertain situations. Using the Chinese version of Penn State Worry Questionnaire, we tested 1135 college students among which 60 students with generalized anxiety and 60 control students were selected. The 120 students participated in a test under ordinary situations in Experiment 1 and in another test under uncertain situations in Experiment 2. Results showed significant differences between students with generalized anxiety and control students in their attentional bias under uncertain, rather than ordinary situations. Under uncertain situations, students with generalized anxiety paid more attention to negative stimuli than their counterparts without generalized anxiety did. Additionally, they also felt more stressful and anxious under uncertain situations than their counterparts did.",

The influence of mine construction safety on the project is complex and important, including schedule on milestones, delays in project duration, quality and cost overruns.To reduce the worker' unsafe behaviors on the mine construction project, a number of safety managemnt methods, including legal method, administrative method, economic method, scientific and technological method, cultural method, media method, have been taken to migrate this problem in the face of the poor safety records. However, not all of these methods are effective enough to satisfy with the need of time, resources and cost. Then, to compare and analyze the degree of effectiveness of the methods can help us concentrate on the major management methods. This paper tries to evaluate the current safety management methods and prioritize them with the consideration of various decision criteria. The nonstructural fuzzy decision making method is applied to solve this multiobjective problem. Analysis results shows that the method is suitable for the appraisal of complex construction problems, which allows assessment based on a pair-wise comparison of alternatives using semantic operators, even under the condition that in sufficient precise information is available. Finally, policy implications are obtained to strengthen the safety management on mine construction project.",

        "abstract": "PurposeCurrently, the researches on garment development and wear comfort evaluation mainly focus on the static condition type and seldom involved dynamic condition. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop cycling clothes’ patterns and evaluate their dynamic wear comfort.Design/methodology/approachFirst, the 3D-to-2D flattening technology was applied to develop garment patterns of a cycler’s jersey T-shirt. Then, 3D animation technology was used to simulate the scene of cycling. Next, a novel pressure-measuring method was proposed to measure static and dynamic clothing pressures in a virtual environment. Finally, the collected data were used for evaluating wear comfort.FindingsCompared to static conditions, the dynamic wear comfort noticeably improved at the front neck, side neck, upper front chest, around back neck point and front shoulder, and the front neck. Compared to static conditions, the dynamic wear comfort visibly deteriorates at the back neck, below chest, outseam, back except around back neck point and around scapula, and the around scapula area. The dynamic pressure at back neck, below front chest and shoulder fluctuate wildly throughout the whole cycling. On the contrary, the dynamic pressure at the front neck, side neck, front upper chest and at the back cause it to tend to stability during cycling.Originality/valueThe 3D virtual-reality technology was applied to simulate cycling. And a novel method was proposed to measure numerical clothing pressures for evaluating the dynamic wear comfort. The proposed method can not only quantitatively evaluate the wear comfort of cycling clothes and optimize cycling clothes’ patterns, but also can be applied to other tight garment types.",

The maximum break-over time in 32 IGBTs was 90 ns, while failure protection completion time was 6 μs. Eight independent isolated sources were designed for the isolation voltage of 50 kV.

In the structure of the biosensor, a three electrode system was utilized-quartz crystal Au working electrode, Ag/AgCl/Cl sat - reference electrode and Pt counter electrode. The results indicate that the immobilization of antibodies and the binding of E. coli cells to the Au electrode surface increased the imedance, which was directly measured with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the presence of [Fe(CN)6]3-7/4 as a redox probe. The Δimpedance, Zcells subtract Zantibody, is correlated with the concentration of E. coli cells.

A tube was put in and then ESWL was used. Three of them were operated on because of their serious narrow ureters and the ureteroscope could not get into them. Serious infection and the ureter tearing did not occur in them. [Conclusion] Pneumatic lithotripsy through rigid transurethral ureteroscope is not only safe, dependable, but also less invasive with complete clearance of the calculi.

        "abstract": "802.11-based wireless LANs (WLANs) have become an important communication infrastructure for today's pervasive computing applications. Nevertheless, WLAN users often experience various performance issues such as highly variable signal quality. To diagnose such transient service degradations and plan for future network upgrades, it is essential to closely monitor the performance of a WLAN and collect user statistics. This paper proposes a new WLAN performance monitoring approach motivated by the fact that many low-power wireless technologies such as ZigBee and Bluetooth co-exist with WLAN in the same open radio spectrum and are capable of sensing Received Signal Strength (RSS) of 802.11 transmissions. We have developed a ZigBee-based WLAN monitoring system called WizNet. Powered by batteries, ZigBee sensors of WizNet can be deployed in large quantities to monitor the spatial performance of a WLAN in long periods of time. By adopting digital signal processing techniques, WizNet automatically identifies 802.11 signals from ZigBee RSS measurements and associates them with wireless access points. To ensure the monitoring fidelity, WizNet accounts for the significant differences in ZigBee and WLAN radios, such as bandwidth and susceptibility to multipath and frequency-selective fading. A simple yet accurate linear estimator derived from a signal propagation model is used to infer the access points' signal to noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, WizNet can measure the congestion level of the channel and detect rogue APs. WizNet can also collect WLAN client statistics and classify device models based on RSS signatures of 802.11 access point scans. We have implemented WizNet in TinyOS 2.x and extensively evaluated its performance on a wireless testbed. Our results over a period of 140 hours show that WizNet can accurately capture the spatial and temporal performance variability of a large-scale production WLAN.",

        "abstract": "A pyridone alkaloid, asperpyridone A (), which possesses an unusual pyrano[3,2-]pyridine scaffold, was isolated from solid cultures of the endophytic fungus  sp. TJ23. Its structure, including its absolute configuration, was determined using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, quantum chemical calculations (electronic circular dichroism), and X-ray crystallography. In vitro bioassays demonstrated that asperpyridone A () could function as a potential hypoglycemic agent, which exhibited pronounced glucose uptake effect in liver HepG2 cells, under both normal and insulin-resistant conditions, with higher efficacy than metformin. The underlying mechanism of asperpyridone A was elucidated by analyzing the genes expressed, the Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment, the protein interaction network, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which suggested that asperpyridone A exhibits hypoglycemic activity by activating the insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, on the basis of the hypoglycemic potency, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) was determined to be a potential target for asperpyridone A.",

        "abstract": "Vanadium is a metal of high physiological, environmental and industrial importance. However, vanadium-induced oxidative stress can reduce the egg quality of poultry, and be potentially harmful to humans, and the underlying mechanism is not clear. In this study, we investigated the underlying relationship between the oxidant-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and vanadium-induced oxidative stress in oviduct magnum epithelial (OME) cells. Cultured OME cells were treated with 100 μmol L vanadium and/or MAPK inhibitors [P38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580; extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor, U0126; c-JUN N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor, SP600125]. Cell viability, apoptosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using flow cytometry. The expression of oxidative stress-related genes and their proteins was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Vanadium treatment reduced cell viability, whereas pretreated OME cells with SB203580 and U0126 prevented the reducing effect of vanadium on cell viability (P < 0.05). Likewise, MAPK inhibitors effectively suppressed vanadium-induced apoptosis and ROS generation (P < 0.05). In the OME cells treated with vanadium, SB203580 (P < 0.05) and SP600125 (P = 0.08) increased catalase activity by 89.3% and 55.3%; SB203580 and U0126 increased (P < 0.05) glutathione peroxidase activity by 44.9% and 51.1%, respectively. Incubation of OME cells with MAPK inhibitors also prevents malondialdehyde concentration increase and lactic dehydrogenase activity decrease in response to vanadium (P < 0.05). Vanadium downregulated P38, ERK1/2, JNK, Nrf2, sMaf, GCLC, NQO1 and HO-1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). In contrast, inhibition of JNK with SP600125 upregulated P38, ERK1/2, JNK, Nrf2, GCLC and HO-1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05); inhibition of P38 with SB203580 upregulated JNK, NQO1 and HO-1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05); and inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 upregulated ERK1/2, GCLC and HO-1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, phosphorylation of P38, ERK1/2, JNK, and Nrf2 proteins was enhanced by V incubation; however, SP600125 blocked the phosphorylation of these proteins, whereas SB203580 blocked the phosphorylation of P38 and Nrf2. These results indicate that vanadium inducing oxidative stress in OME cells might be, at least, associated with the phosphorylation of the P38MAPK/JNK-Nrf2 pathway, which reduces the expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes.",

Using western blotting to examine MEKK2 expression in 16 cases of primary colorectal cancer (CRC) lesions with paired normal mucosa, it was identified that MEKK2 is highly expressed in CRC lesions compared with that of the normal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry of 24 normal mucosa, 24 adenoma and 96 adenocarcinoma colorectal specimens indicated that the expression of MEKK2 was significantly increased in the adenoma and carcinoma specimens compared with that of the normal mucosa cases (P<0.0001 for both). However, no significant differences were detected in MEKK2 expression between the carcinoma and adenoma specimens (P=0.85). Similarly, no correlations were identified between MEKK2 expression and clinicopathological features, including gender, age, body mass index, histological differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, UICC stage and K-ras mutations (P>0.05). The present study demonstrated that MEKK2 functions as a promotive factor in CRC.",

        "abstract": "Introduction  :  Daratumumab (DARA) is an anti-CD38 human monoclonal antibody that is approved as a monotherapy and in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pom-dex), or bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with RRMM. Pom is an immunomodulatory drug that increases CD38 expression on multiple myeloma cells. The addition of Pom to DARA was hypothesized to enhance the efficacy of DARA and improve patient outcomes. A multi-arm, phase 1b study (NCT01998971) evaluated DARA in combination with various backbone therapies; updated data from the DARA + pom-dex arm with an additional 1 year of follow-up are presented.   Methods  :  Patients in the DARA + pom-dex arm had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score ≤2, an absolute neutrophil count of ≥1×10 9 /L, ≥2 prior lines of therapy including at least 2 consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and bortezomib, and were refractory to their last line of therapy. Only Pom-naive patients were enrolled. DARA 16 mg/kg was administered intravenously (IV) in 28-day Cycles (weekly for Cycles 1-2, every 2 weeks for Cycles 3-6, and every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression); Pom 4 mg was administered orally (PO) on Days 1-21; and dex 40 mg was administered IV/PO per week. Safety was the primary endpoint. Efficacy endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Cytogenetic risk was determined from bone marrow aspirates at screening. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed via next generation sequencing (NGS).   Results  : A total of 103 patients received ≥1 dose of DARA + pom-dex. Median (range) age was 64 (35-86) years. Median number of prior therapies was 4 (1-13) and 52% of patients had received u003e3 prior therapies; 89%, 71%, 30%, and 71% of patients were refractory to lenalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, and a proteasome inhibitor + immunomodulatory drug, respectively. Of the 87 patients with available cytogenetic profile, 25% were high-risk (18% del17p, 7% t[4;14], and 1% t[14;16]). 44% of patients had baseline grade 1 or 2 neutropenia (Chari A, et al.  Blood  . 2017 doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-05-785246; epub, ahead of print).  At the clinical cutoff date of June 16, 2017, a total of 82% of patients discontinued treatment due to progressive disease (51%), adverse events (AEs; 17%), patient withdrawal (4%), physician9s decision (4%), death (4%), and other reasons (3%). Most common (u003e25%) grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were neutropenia (79%; febrile neutropenia [8%]) and anemia (28%). Serious AEs occurred in 57% of patients, and 19%, 22%, and 19% were related to DARA, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone, respectively. TEAEs leading to death occurred in 9% of patients; none were related to DARA.  At a median follow-up of 24.7 (range: 0.2-34.4) months, the ORR was 66% (12% stringent complete response [CR], 11% CR, 26% very good partial response [VGPR], and 18% partial response). The rates of ≥VGPR and ≥CR were 48% and 22%, respectively. Among responders, the median duration of response was 21.4 (95% CI, 13.6-not estimable [NE]) months. In the total study population, MRD-negative rates were 8%, 7%, and 2% at sensitivity thresholds of 10 -4 , 10 -5 , and 10 -6 , respectively. Median PFS was 9.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-15.4) and the 24-month PFS rate was 30% (95% CI, 21-40). Median OS was 25.1 months (95% CI, 15.6-NE) and the estimated 24-month survival rate was 52% (95% CI, 41-62).  Updated safety and efficacy data, including a listing of secondary primary malignancies based on longer follow up, will be presented at the meeting.   Conclusions  :  Adding DARA to pom-dex resulted in a safety profile consistent with that of the individual therapies. Deep, durable responses were observed, including MRD negativity, and the regimen was associated with encouraging OS in a heavily pretreated patient population. A phase 3 study evaluating DARA + pom-dex versus pom-dex in RRMM patients (APOLLO; NCT03180736) is ongoing.

        "abstract": "Soluble dietary fibers (SDF) are fermented more than insoluble dietary fibers (IDF), but their effect on colonic bacterial community structure and function remains unclear. Thus, bacterial community composition and function in the colon of BALB/c mice ( = 7) fed with a high level (approximately 20%) of typical SDF, oat-derived β-glucan (G), microcrystalline cellulose (M) as IDF, or their mixture (GM), were compared. Mice in group G showed a lowest average feed intake ( < 0.05) but no change on the average body weight gain ( > 0.05) compared to other groups, which may be associated with the highest concentration of colonic propionate ( < 0.05) in these mice. The bacterial α-diversity of group G was significantly lower than other groups ( < 0.01). In group G, the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum  was significantly increased, whereas bacteria from the phylum  were significantly decreased ( < 0.01). The core bacteria for different treatments showed distinct differences. , , and , including known acetogens and carbohydrate fermenting organisms, were significantly increased in relative abundance in group G. In contrast, , , and  were significantly more abundant in group M, whereas , , and , typical hydrogenotrophs equipped with multiple carbohydrate active enzymes, were remarkably enriched in group GM ( < 0.05). The relative abundance of bacteria from the three classes of , ,  (including ) and , were significantly more abundant in group G, indicating a higher ratio of conditional pathogenic bacteria in mice fed dietary β-glucan in current study. The predicted colonic microbial function showed an enrichment of \"Energy metabolism\" and \"Carbohydrate metabolism\" pathways in mice from group G and M, suggesting that the altered bacterial community in the colon of mice with the two dietary fibers probably resulted in a more efficient degradation of dietary polysaccharides. Our result suggests that the influence of dietary β-glucan (SDF) on colonic bacterial community of mice was more extensively than MCC (IDF). Co-supplementation of the two fibers may help to increase the bacterial diversity and reduce the conditional pathogens in the colon of mice.",

        "abstract": "As one of the cornerstones of networked systems, the design of resolution between names and resources, that is, name resolution, is crucial. In recent years, with the emerging research on future Internet architectures, many namespaces and resolution systems have been proposed. However, these namespaces and resolution systems are closed systems, where a system can only support one or more predefined namespaces and the policies for resolution among them. Such closed design lacks the flexibility of defining new resolution policy and interoperability among different networked systems. In this article, we analyze the existing namespaces and resolution systems in various network architectures and propose a generic name resolution framework, which can allow flexible namespace and resolution policy definition and enable interoperation among different network architectures. A prototype of such a name resolution system supporting the interoperability among WiFi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth, and the interoperability between NDN and HTTP is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This study was to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients aged 44 years and younger.Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained CRC database and divided into two groups by age: younger and older group (≤44 and >44 years). Clinicopathologic characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared.There were 530 patients aged ≤44 years at diagnosis. More patients in the younger group had a family history of CRC compared with older patients. Younger patients were more likely than older patients to have larger tumours, infiltrative growth type tumours, poorly differentiated tumours, mucinous and signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma, and advanced TNM stages. Compared to older patients, more younger patients received chemotherapy and died of cancer-related causes. Overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival of younger patients were comparable to older patients. Blood transfusion, TNM stage, histological grade and disease recurrence were independently associated with survival in the younger group.Despite younger patients having unfavourable clinicopathologic features, younger age at diagnosis of CRC appears to be associated with similar oncologic outcomes as compared to older patients.",

        "abstract": "With the advances of control and vehicular communication technologies, a group of connected and autonomous (CA) vehicles can drive cooperatively to form a so-called cooperative driving pattern, which has been verified to significantly improve road safety, traffic efficiency and the environmental sustainability. A more general scenario that various types of cooperative driving, such as vehicle platooning and traffic monitoring, coexist on roads will appear soon. To support such multiple cooperative drivings, it is critical to design an efficient scheduling algorithm for periodical message dissemination, i.e. beacon, in a shared communication channel, which has not been fully addressed before. In this paper, we consider multiple cooperative drivings in a bidirectional road, and propose both the decentralized and the RSU-assisted centralized beacon scheduling algorithms which aim at guaranteeing reliable delivery of beacon messages for cooperative drivings as well as maximizing the channel utilization. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

Then forward modeling method is used to model hands and foots, photo modeling method is used to model head and reverse modeling method is used to model torso. After that, hands, foots, head and torso are integrated together to get a static avatar. Next, virtual skeleton is bound to the avatar. Finally, a lifelike digital human body model is created by the mixed modeling method (MMM).FindingsIn allusion to the defect of the three-dimension original data of human body, this paper presented an MMM, with which we can get a realistic digital human body model with accurate body dimensions. The DHM can well meet the needs of fashion industry.Practical implicationsThe DHM, which is got by the MMM, can be well applied in the field of virtual try on, virtual fashion design, virtual fashion show and so on.Originality/valueThe originality of the paper lies in the integration of forward modeling, reverse modeling and photo modeling to present a novel method of human body modeling.",

The result of ANOVA showed that Kunming mice,which were in the state of immunosuppression,went into the peak period of bacteremia immediately within 3 days,when they were inoculated by purified Eperythrozoon suis through caudal vein with the dosage of 0.1 mL.The test of drug sensitivity revealed that berenil,imidocarb and artemisinin had the strongest activity against Eperythrozoon suis.Thus,the established model should be used to screen drugs efficiently against Eperythrozoon suis.",

Unlike the conventional crossbar and the crossbar with crosspoint buffers, which require complex hardware resolvers to grant one out of multiple output requests, CTC(N) can tolerate output contentions by a pipelining mechanism, with pipeline stages implemented as buffers in input ports. These buffers are used to decouple the scheduling task into N independent parts in such a way that N schedulers are located in N input ports, and they operate independently and in parallel. Without using arbiters and/or crosspoint buffers that require additional chip area, the CTC(N) switch is more scalable than existing crossbars. We analyze the throughput of CTC(N) switch without and with internal speedup by building a queuing model. We show that, under Bernoulli i.i.d. uniform traffic, CTC(N) without internal speedup has worst-case throughput of 63%, and CTC(N) achieves 100% throughput with internal speedup 2. Our simulation results validate our theoretical analysis.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed for missioncritical applications face the fundamental challenge of meeting stringent spatiotemporal performance requirements using nodes with limited sensing capacity. Although advance network planning and dense node deployment may initially achieve the required performance, they often fail to adapt to the unpredictability of physical reality. This paper explores efficient use of mobile sensors to address the limitations of static WSNs in target detection. We propose a data fusion model that enables static and mobile sensors to effectively collaborate in target detection. An optimal sensor movement scheduling algorithm is developed to minimize the total moving distance of sensors while achieving a set of spatiotemporal performance requirements including high detection probability, low system false alarm rate and bounded detection delay. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive simulations based on real data traces collected by 23 sensor nodes. © 2008 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Objective To analyze clinicopathological features of synchronous colorectal carcinoma. Methods Data of colorectal cancer patients admitted to our hospital from June 1994 to December 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into multiple synchronous colorectal carcinoma group ( MCG) and single colorectal cancer group ( SCG). Clinicopathological features and prognosis were compared between the two groups. SPSS 10. 0 was used for data analysis. Results Of all colorectal cancer(CRC) patients,3. 2 % (39/1225) had multiple synchronous CRCs and 939 patients had sporadic single CRC. In MCG, two patients had hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC) syndrome. No significant differences were found between MCG and SCG with regard to demographic features, Dukes stage and differentiation of index CRC. More patients in MCG had metachronous CRC (x2 = 4. 545, P= 0.033) and colorectal polyps ( x2 = 12. 013, P = 0.001) compared with SCG. Forty-six percent of multiple synchronous CRCs located in right colon in MCG, which was higher than that in SCG ( x2 = 25. 757 ,P = 0. 0001). Malignancy in adenoma was the frequent event accompanying cancer in MCG. Five-year survival rate in MCG was 57% compared with 64% in SCG ( x2 =0.084, P = 0.772 ). Conclusion Patients with right colon cancer seem easily to have multiple synchronous CRCs and malignancy in adenoma is most frequently accompanying the cancer. For patients with multiple synchronous CRCs, the prognosis is equivalent to that of patients with SCG.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the effects of different doses of 17Β-estradiol on cognitive function and the expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal CAI region and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in rats with vascular dementia (VD). Methods: A total of 50 healthy male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into sham operation, model and treatment groups (80, 200 and 400 μg/kg dose groups), 10 in each group. The VD model was established by ligating bilateral common carotid arteries. The treatment group was injected 17Β-estradiol intraperitoneally at the second day after the procedure, once every other day; the sham operation and model groups were injected equivalent volume of sterilized peanut oil, and successively injected 30 times for 60 days. The abilities of learning and memory in rats were assessed by Y maze test after 60 days. The expressions of GFAP and nNOS in rat hippocampal CA1 region were detected by immunohistochemical assay. Results: The correct times of learning ability were tested for 30 times in the sham operation, model and treatment (80, 200 and 400 μg/kg) groups, they were 25.8 ± 1.8, 15.5 ± 2.0, 21.2 ± 2.2, 23.7 ± 2.0, and 20.5 ± 2.1, respectively; the correct times of memory ability were 26.2 ± 1.7, 16.0 ± 1.9, 21.3 ± 1.7, 23. 4 ± 2.1, and 21.6 ± 2.0, respectively; the number of GFAP positive cells were 16.5 ± 1.7, 28.8 ± 1.6, 23. 4 ± 1.4, 20.2 ± 1.6, and 27.6 ± 2.0, respectively; the number of nNOS positive cells were 30.3 ± 2.5, 17.8 ± 1.7, 22.1 ± 1.9, 25.8 ± 1.7, and 21.4 ± 1.8, respectively. There was statistical significance in the abilities of learning and memory, and the expressions of GFAP and nNOS positive cells in the model group as compared with other groups (F = 37.620, P = 0.000; F = 39.112, P = 0.000; F = 91.484, P = 0.000; F = 58.839, P = 0.000). There were also statistical significance between the 200 μg/kg dose group and the 80 and 400 μg/kg dose groups (F = 4.983, P = 0.000; F = 16.718, P = 0. 00. Conclusions: 17Β-estradiol may significantly improve the cognitive impairment in rats after chronic ischemia. Its mechanism may be associated with the expressions of decreasing GFAP and increasing nNOS positive cells, and the efficacy was associated with the dosage of estriol.",

        "abstract": "For many emerging mobile broadband services and applications, the source and destination are located in the same local region. Consequently, it is very important to design access networks to facilitate efficient local data exchange. In the past few years, most existing studies focus on either the wired or wireless domains. In this paper, we aim to exploit both the wired and wireless domains. Specifically, we consider a fiber-wireless access network in which a passive optical network (PON), consisting of one optical line terminal and multiple optical network units (ONUs), connects densely deployed base stations. In such a scenario, we propose two novel access schemes to utilize both network coding and device association in the following two cases: each device can be associated with one ONU for uploading and downloading its data packets; and each device can be associated with two different ONUs for uploading and downloading its data packets, which are referred to as, the network coding design and symmetric device association (NCsDA) problem and the network coding design and asymmetric device association (NCaDA) problem, respectively. To understand the potentials of NCsDA, we first formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming to minimize the weighted number of packet transmissions (WNT), which is related to both the energy consumption and system capacity. We then theoretically analyze the tight upper bounds of the minimal WNT in the PON, which helps us to approximate the NCsDA problem by mixed integer linear programming. We also give theoretical analysis on the NCaDA problem and formulate it as a mixed integer linear programming. Next, we develop efficient algorithms based on linear programming relaxation and give network coding designs to solve the NCsDA problem and the NCaDA problem. To validate our design, we conduct extensive simulations, which demonstrate the impact of important network parameters and the promising potentials of the proposed NCsDA and NCaDA schemes.",

        "abstract": "With the recent emergence of online network performance measuring tools, Internet users are now able to measure their received service levels. Such user-initiated network performance measurements push the ISPs to an ever-high standard, requiring them to know the worst-case performance of its admitted flows, whether and where to accommodate a new flow request, without violating the service agreement level (SLA). Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) has been developed to derive performance bounds of a network system for many years in the research community. However, it has not been practically adopted by ISPs due to the lack of a tool supporting features such as end-to-end analysis or optimal parameter tuning. In this demo, we extended the DISCO Stochastic Network Calculator. We also compare the analytical results obtained from the tool with the simulation results obtained in NS-3 to validate the tightness of the performance bounds.",

These nanocrystallites were identified as pure lithium ferrite by x-ray diffraction analysis. Their magnetization and de-magnetization were measured by using a vibrating sample magnetometer at different temperatures. The specific saturation magnetization and the coercivities change with the diameter of these nanocrystallites and with temperature. The effective magnetic anisotropy constants KE of these samples were deduced by using the law of approach to saturation. It is found that the KE value of a lithium ferrite nanocrystallite of diameter 9.1 nm is about ten times greater than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1 of bulk lithium ferrite. The coercivities of these nanocrystallites at different temperatures were calculated by using the mixed coercivity model. The calculated coercivity results are consistent with the experimental ones.",

        "abstract": "Beclin-1 is an autophagy gene. It promotes the formation of the autophagic vesicle as well as plays an essential role in guarding the cells against chromosomal instability. Overexpression of Beclin-1 has been reported to predict a favorable survival in various cancers. However, little is known about its prognostic significance in colorectal cancer.A total of three hundred and sixty-three (363) colorectal tissues from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were collected. Tissue micro-arrays and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of Beclin-1 in CRC. The associations among Beclin-1 expression, clinicopathological parameters and prognosis were evaluated.Beclin-1 had a higher expression in CRC tissues than in normal tissues. A high expression of Beclin-1 was positively correlated with gender (P=0.027), histological grade (P=0.003), pM status (P=0.003) and clinical stage (P=0.024). Patients with a high Beclin-1 expression, when compared to those with a lower expression had both a better overall survival (OS, P=0.006) and disease-free survival (DFS, P=0.008). In the pT3 subgroup, Beclin-1 was also found to be a good prognostic indicator (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed a high expression of Beclin-1 was indeed a positive independent prognostic factor of OS and DFS for CRC patients (P<0.05).Our results demonstrated that a high expression of Beclin-1 correlated with a better overall survival and disease-free survival, thus serving as a favorable independent prognostic marker in CRC.",

Allografts survival period and the testicular cells or islets function were analyzed.The mean survival period of control group was 4.6 +/- 1.1 days. When CsA was administered after transplantation, the mean survival period of islet allografts, (21.8 +/- 4.7) days, was significantly longer than that of control group (P < 0.01). When islets were co-transplanted together with 1 x 10(7) testicular cells (group A), a significant prolongation of graft survival was found (more than 57.5 +/- 4.0 days; P < 0.01 vs. control). But if 1 x 10(7) testicular cells expressing FasL were cultured with FasL-mAb for 30 minutes before co-transplantation (group B), the mean survival period of islet allografts (5.8 +/- 2.6 days), was similar to that in control group, but significantly shorter than that in group A (P < 0.01). When islets and 1 x 10(5) testicular cells were co-transplanted separately into the bilateral renal subcapsular space with CsA (group C), the survival of islet allografts was significantly prolonged in comparison with control group (more than 55.0 +/- 6.5 days; P < 0.01 vs. control), and similar to islets co-transplanted together with 1 x 10(7) testicular cells (group A). When islets were co-transplanted separately with 1 x 10(6) testicular cells without CsA (group D), the mean survival period (11.5 +/- 3.1 days) was shorter than that in group C, but prolonged in comparison to control group (P < 0.05).The co-transplanted testicular cells expressing FasL with administering CsA post-transplantation can jointly inhibit immune rejection of islet allografts by different mechanism and play a systemic and synergistic protective role to islet allografts.",

        "abstract": "AIM: This study was to explore the expression of spleen tyrosine kinase(SYK)(L) and SYK(S) in breast cancer cells and their effects on invasive phenotype of breast cancer cell line MB435. METHODS: The expression of SYK in breast cancer cell lines MB435, ZR75.1, MB468, T47D and MCF 7 were detected by Western blotting. MB435 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-SYK(L), pcDNA3.1-SYK(S) or pcDNA3.1 respectively, G418-resistant stable clones were pooled and the SYK expression was measured by Western blotting. Chemoinvasion assays were performed to study the effects of SYK(L) and SYK(S) on breast cancer cell invasion.RESULTS: SYK(L) and SYK(S) were simultaneously expressed in most detected breast cancer cells. Pooled SYK(L) and SYK(S) stable clones were made by Fugene 6 transfection and G418 selection. The expression of SYK(L) suppressed the invasive ability of breast cancer cells, while SYK(S) didn't.CONCLUSION: The simultaneously expression of SYK(L) and SYK(S) in breast cancer cells is a common phenomenon. Among SYK(L) and SYK(S),only SYK(L) protein is capable of suppressing the invasion of breast cancer cells.",

Corrida was mixture of RCMS hybrid without pollens and pollen supplier line. R2008 could restore the fertility of RCMS lines in different years. Therefore,sterile line, maintainers and restorers of RCMS were obtained. The genetic studies indicated that the restorer was controlled by one dominant gene. The genotype of RCMS lines was S(rr) ,restorer line was ? (RR) and maintainer line was N (rr) . All present Brassica napus lines were maintainers of RCMS lines. Compared with local rapeseed varieties,R2008 has longer growth period (240 days) ,higher erucic acid content (12. 93% ) ,higher glucosinolates content (78. 63 μmol/g) ,lower silique-bearing percentage (74. 89%) and more serious cold injury (cold injury rate was 100% and cold injury index was 73. 5) .

        "abstract": "The transformations of magnetite and hematite, which are main existing forms of iron oxides in nature, have been debated for many years. The transformation of magnetite and hematite in nature has generally been considered as a result of a redox reaction and linked to a specific oxidant or reductant. However, a nonredox reaction mechanism was proposed in recent years and it might be helpful in better understanding the complicated mineralization process. Ore textures caused by replacement of hematite and magnetite in natural environment was summarized in this paper. The nonredox reactions might exist in many different mineralization processes on the basis of evidences from studying on BIF and experimental ways. Mechanisms for the transformations of magnetite and hematite provide important significances both in theoretical and practical aspects: one hand, it indicates that the presence of magnetite and hematite in geologic formations may not provide meaningful information on the redox state of fluid; the other hand, it will provide new exploration strategies for hematite rich secondary ores, extending the target for orebodies to deep zones below the paleosurface.",

        "abstract": "Optical burst switching is a promising all-optical switching technology for the next generation optical networks and signaling is one of the key components of it. According to propagation direction of control packets, the existing signaling schemes for optical burst switched networks can be roughly divided into three categories: one-way, two-way, and hybrid signaling. Since one-way signaling launches bursts without the acknowledgment of successful reservation of resources, it has small end-to-end delay but high data loss rate; two-way signaling uses a control packet to gather the state of links and needs the successful acknowledgment before sending out a burst, so it has large end-to-end delay but low data loss rate. A hybrid signaling gets a tradeoff of performance between one-way and two-way signaling. In this paper, we propose another hybrid signaling named inverse two-way signaling. By introducing the process of link state collection into one-way signaling, the inverse two-way signaling can decrease the data loss rate without increasing the end-to-end delay compared to one-way signaling. In other words, the inverse two-way signaling is an improved version of one-way signaling. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

D(2) lymphadenectomy was performed in 75 (86.2%), and D(3) in 13 cases (13.8%). Distal gastrectomy was performed in 59 (67.8%), total gastrectomy in 24 (27.6%) and proximal gastrectomy in l4 cases (4.6%). Twenty-three (26.4%) cases received postoperative chemotherapy and 64 (73.6% ) did not. The 5-year survival rate of the 87 pN0 gastric carcinoma patients was 56.5%. There were no differences in survival rate considering age, tumor location, gastrectomy, lymph nodes dissection, differentiation grade, and tumor-stroma relationship (P > 0.05), while the differences were significant in survival rate between the patients with postoperative chemotherapy,lymphatic invasion,venous invasion or not,and different pT staging (all Pa< 0.05). The Cox regression analysis revealed that pT staging and postoperative chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors.pT staging and postoperative chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors. It is necessary to develop a precise staging technique to select a suitable surgical therapy or confirm which patients should accept postoperative chemotherapy in pN0 gastric carcinoma patients.",

        "abstract": "In crowdsourcing markets, a requester announces a task and calls for contribution from potential participants. With strategic participants, the requester needs to reward the participants to introduce the incentives of participation. However, it is natural to ask whether it is worth introducing incentives if the total payment for eliciting incentives is too high. This paper addresses such a fundamental concern by designing a frugal mechanism with minimum payment used to procure the total amount of service contributions demanded. We design two mechanisms to provide the incentives of participation while minimizing the payment used by the requester. We first propose a frugal auction-based mechanism, which stimulates participants to truthfully report their information. We theoretically prove that the payment used is not more than the optimal cost (with no incentive considered) plus a bounded additive. We then design a Stackelberg-game-based mechanism, in which the requester fixes a certain total payment at the very beginning so as to encourage the participants to compete for it and participate in the task. We verify the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) and develop a novel algorithm to find the NE, as well as the optimal payment to extract the NE. Our simulation results show that the payment used in these mechanisms is close to the optimal solution with no incentive considered, while the extra payment caused by introducing truthfulness in auction-based mechanism is about twice that of the NE in Stakelberg-game-based mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Service-oriented wireless sensor network (WSN) has been recently proposed as an architecture to rapidly develop applications in WSNs. In WSNs, a query task may require a set of services and may be carried out repetitively with a given frequency during its lifetime. A service composition solution shall be provided for each execution of such a persistent query task. Due to the energy saving strategy, some sensors may be scheduled to be in sleep mode periodically. Thus, a service composition solution may not always be valid during the lifetime of a persistent query. When a query task needs to be conducted over a new service composition solution, a routing update procedure is involved which consumes energy. In this paper, we study service composition design which minimizes the number of service composition solutions during the lifetime of a persistent query. We also aim to minimize the total service composition cost when the minimum number of required service composition solutions is derived. A greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm are proposed to complete these two objectives respectively. The optimality of both algorithms provides the service composition solutions for a persistent query with minimum energy consumption.",

SSRs\n have been used extensively as sequence tagged markers in genetic studies. Recently, the functional and evolutionary importance\n of SSRs has received considerable attention. Here we report the mining and characterization of the SSRs in papaya genome.\n We analyzed SSRs from 277.4 Mb of whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences, 51.2 Mb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end\n sequences (BES), and 13.4 Mb expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences. The papaya SSR density was one SSR per 0.7 kb of DNA\n sequence in the WGS, which was higher than that in BES and EST sequences. SSR abundance was dramatically reduced as the repeat\n length increased. According to SSR motif length, dinucleotide repeats were the most common motif in class I, whereas hexanucleotides\n were the most copious in class II SSRs. The tri- and hexanucleotide repeats of both classes were greater in EST sequences\n compared to genomic sequences. In class I SSR, AT and AAT were the most frequent motifs in BES and WGS sequences. By contrast,\n AG and AAG were the most abundant in EST sequences. For SSR marker development, 9,860 primer pairs were surveyed for amplification\n and polymorphism. Successful amplification and polymorphic rates were 66.6% and 17.6%, respectively. The highest polymorphic\n rates were achieved by AT, AG, and ATG motifs. The genome wide analysis of microsatellites revealed their frequency and distribution\n in papaya genome, which varies among plant genomes. This complete set of SSRs markers throughout the genome will assist diverse\n genetic studies in papaya and related species.",

        "abstract": "In a large-scale storage-centric wireless sensor network (SWSN) where data from different clusters are archived at distributed storage nodes, the dispatching design problem is to determine one or multiple storage nodes for each cluster. To achieve high data fidelity in SWSNs, the dispatching design should aim to reduce the data loss due to the network congestion and, at the same time, to prolong the network lifetime by avoiding sending excessive traffic to some particular storage nodes in order to achieve energy consumption balance among the relaying sensors around the storage node. In this paper, we propose an h-peak dispatching design for SWSN. Under such a design, regular traffic volume from each cluster will receive guaranteed data fidelity, and over-expectation traffic will receive best-effort data fidelity. We use an h-peak model to characterize the traffic deviation which assumes that at most h clusters may have over-expectation traffic simultaneously at a storage node. By incorporating h into the dispatching decision rather than assuming that all clusters may reach their traffic spikes simultaneously, the proposed h-peak dispatching design can achieve high data fidelity in SWSNs.",

Kinetic parameter for drying rate change was determined using moisture (M). Higher drying rates were observed with high microwave energy. Page model kinetics was employed to describe the drying rate change and gave good fit for all experimental runs. Kinetic parameter for color change were determined using L-, a- , b-values. The drying process changed all three color parameters (L, a, b), causing a color shift towards the darker region. Parameters a-and b-values increased and L-values decreased during drying. Zero- and first-order kinetics models were applied to describe color change, L-and b-values followed first-order and a-values followed zero-kinetics.",

The effects of the way of installment and the geometry of the pre-detonators on detonation transmission are studied and discussed. The pre-detonators are installed at the close end of the main detonation tube in two basic ways: either in parallel with or perpendicular to the main detonation tube. The results indicate that the perpendicular arrangement is better than the parallel one because the reflected shock waves play an important role in detonation transmission. The results also demonstrate that the diameter ratio of the pre-detonator to the main detonation tube is a very important parameter. The length of the pre-detonator is much less important than its diameter. For the case of the same mixtures, if the diameter is smaller than the critical diameter, detonation transmission cannot be assured by increasing the length of the pre-detonation tube alone.",

These particles, with a coercivity of 923 Oe and Co content of 3.5 wt%, were prepared by the usual method but with an extra special heat treatment process, step annealing. The induced effective uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K1 of the particles were determined by analyzing the torque curves. The activation energy E of these samples was measured and was found to be about 0.68 eV. The higher coercivity and magnetic thermal stability, and the lower temperature coefficient of coercivity of these particles are due mainly to the higher and more stable induced effective uniaxial anisotropy, resulting from the anisotropic arrangement and preferred orientation of cobalt ions promoted by the presence of manganese and the process of step annealing. With the above characteristics and low Co content, these acicular particles could be promising candidates for particulate high-density magnetic recording materials. ? 1995.",

        "abstract": "In an integrated fiber and wireless (FiWi) access network consisting of a wireless subnetwork and an optical subnetwork, multipath routing may be applied in the wireless subnetwork to improve throughput. Due to different delays along multiple paths, packets may arrive at the destination out of order, which may cause Transmission Control Protocl (TCP) performance degradation. In this paper, we propose two mechanisms to improve in-order departure of packets from the optical line terminal (OLT) in a FiWi network and enhance the TCP performance. We first propose an effective scheduling algorithm at the OLT to ensure possible in-order packet arrivals at the destination. We then design a dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) scheme in the optical subnetwork (i.e.,an Ethernet passive optical network) that gives higher priorities to flows that may trigger fast retransmit and fast recovery in upstream bandwidth allocation. Simulation results show that both the proposed scheduling algorithm and the DBA scheme are effective in improving the TCP performance. © 2011 Optical Society of America.",

Multicast is a means of one-to-many communication which demands simultaneous transmission from a source to a set of receivers. With the introduction of applications demanding various measurements of Quality of Service (QoS), the multicast problem becomes more challenging in terms of end-to-end delay, delay jitter, and loss. Supporting QoS multicast in WDM networks is an important research issue toward providing multicast service in IP over WDM Networks. In this dissertation, I study different models to achieve QoS-assuring multicast in WDM networks under different resource constraints.",

So a number of safety improvement measures have been taken to migrate this problem in the construction industry of China in the face of the poor safety records. However, not all of these programs are effective enough to satisfy with the need of time, resources and cost. Then, to compare and analyze the degree of effectiveness of the measures can help us concentrate on the major management factors. This paper tries to evaluate the current safety management systems and prioritize these steps with the consideration of various decision criteria. The nonstructural fuzzy decision making method is applied to solve this multiobjective problem. Case study shows that the method is suitable for the appraisal of complex construction problems, which allows assessment based on a pair-wise comparison of alternatives using semantic operators, even under the condition that in sufficient precise information is available. Finally, policy implications are obtained to strengthen the safety management in construction project. © 2010 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we carried out steady-state IR absorption, transient IR pump-probe, and waiting-time-dependent two-dimensional (2D) IR measurements on ferrocyanide and ferricyanide ions solvated in water and deuterated water. These two anions are highly symmetric and have distributed cyano groups with IR-active stretching modes in the 5 μm wavelength region. The line width of their linear IR spectra and the initial value of the vibrational frequency-frequency correlation function extracted from their 2D IR spectra indicate water molecules in the hydration shell of the ferro-species are more inhomogeneously distributed but more tightly bound to the cyano groups than those of the ferri-species. Different charges and their distributions in the two anions cause different hydrogen bonding strengths with solvent. The frequency correlation relaxes somewhat slower in ferrocyanide, agreeing with stronger solute-solvent hydrogen-bonding interaction in this case. Mechanisms of the solvent isotope effect on the vibrational relaxation dynamics of the cyano stretching mode are discussed. These results also suggest that in the hydration shell the ferro-species breaks more water structure than the ferri-species, which is opposite to the situation of the bulk water region (beyond the hydration shell) reported previously. This work demonstrated that combined IR methods can be very useful for understanding the molecular details of the structure and dynamics of the hydrated ions.",

        "abstract": "AIM:To investigate the effect of 5-fluorouracil(5-FU)on the expression of the stem cell marker CD133 on colon cancer stem cells. METHODS:CD133 expression on several colon cancer cell lines was detected by flow cytometry. The CD133 positive cells from DLD1 cells were separated by the method of magnetic activated cell separation. Colony assay was used to measure self-renew ability and MTS assay was used to detect the sensitivity to 5-FU after separation. After 5-FU treatment,the change of CD133 mRNA level was measured by qPCR. RESULTS:CD133 expression on the surface of colon cacner cell lines DLD1,HT29,SW480,HCT116,Lovo,RKO was 30.20%,82.00%,0.34%,91.80%,85.30%,0.28% respectively. DLD1 cells had two obvious populations according to CD133 expression. CD133 positive cells were separated from DLD1 cells,the positive purity was 87.21%±5.33% and the negative purity was 84.30%±4.65%. CD133 positive cells formed more colonies with limited dilution colony assay(46.33%±4.44% vs 31.00%±2.00%,P<0.05). CD133 positive cells were less sensitive to 5-FU compared to CD133 negative cells(20% less,P<0.01). 5-FU at concentration of 1 mg/L upregulated CD133 mRNA expression in both DLD1 and HT29 cells,the relative quantity was increased from 1 to 1.684±0.012(P<0.01)and 30.702±0.280 to 49.379±0.460(P<0.01)in HT29 and DLD1,respectively. CONCLUSION:Compared to CD133 negative cells,CD133 positive cells show more ability to form colonies in vitro,and are less sensitive to 5-FU. 5-FU upregulats the mRNA expression of CD133,resulting in the CD133 colon cancer stem cells enrichment during 5-FU treatment.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for media-rich content has driven many efforts to redesign the Internet architecture. As one of the major candidates, information-centric network (ICN) has attracted significant attention, where in-network cache is a key component in different ICN architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for optimal cache management in ICNs which jointly considers caching strategy and content routing. Specifically, we propose a cache management framework for ICNs based on software-defined networking (SDN) where a controller is responsible for determining the optimal caching strategy and content routing via linear network coding (LNC). Under the proposed cache management framework, we formally formulate the problem of minimizing the network bandwidth cost by jointly considering caching strategy and content routing with LNC. We develop an efficient network coding based cache management (NCCM) algorithm to obtain a near-optimal caching and routing solution for ICNs. We further develop a lower bound of the problem and conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance of the NCCM algorithm with the lower bound. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the NCCM algorithm and framework.",

        "abstract": "Network performance tomography infers performance metrics on internal network links with end-to-end measurements. Existing results in this domain are mainly Boolean-based, i.e., they check whether or not a link is identifiable, and return the exact value on identifiable links. If a link is not identifiable, Boolean-based solution gives no performance result for the link. In this paper, we extend Boolean-based network tomography to bound-based network tomography where the lower and upper bounds are derived for unidentifiable links. We develop an efficient algorithm to obtain the tightest total error bound, and present a solution that can significantly reduce the total number of measurement paths required for deriving the tightest total error bound. Furthermore, we propose a method to deploy a new monitor over existing ones such that the total error bound could be maximally reduced. Compared to the random monitor deployment and the monitor deployment that maximizes the total number of identifiable links, our monitor deployment method can lead to up to 15 and 2.4 times more reduction on total error bound, respectively.",

Then the rats in sham operation group and model group were injected normal saline and IGF-1 group was injected IGF-1 via tail vein. Brain tissue of some rats were used to observe nerve cell injury under light microscope after HE staining, and brain tissue of other rats were removed for TTC staining. Positive neurons of nNOS were observed by immunohistochemical method.Results: Compared with the model group, the injury degree of neuron greatly reduced and the infarction volume also markedly decreased in the IGF-1 group (P<0.01). At the same time, the number of nNOS positive neuron dropped significantly in the IGF-1 group compared with model group (P<0.01).Conclusion: IGF-1 plays a protective role in rat focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The nervous protective mechanism of IGF-1 may involve in decreasing nNOS activity.",

In WOAN, transmission delay for traffic up to the Internet consists of wireless path delay in WMNs and waiting delay at ONUs due to the TDMA schedule. The ONU from which transmission delay is minimal is chosen to be the destination for traffic and the minimal transmission delay is defined as delay bound. In the paper, we intend to find the wireless path to the destinated ONU with path delay no more than delay bound and meanwhile with the minimal maximal link delay, which is defined as interference aware and delay bounded routing (IADBR) problem. We propose both centralized and distributed algorithms to solve IADBR. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm performs quite closely to the optimal centralized algorithm and performs much better than the shortest path algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that progesterone (PROG) significantly reduces cerebral edema and enhances functional recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke in several animal models, but its concrete mechanism is still unknown. This study was designed to investigate the inhibitory effects of PROG on inflammatory response after stroke and its influence on the structure of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the treatment group, PROG was dissolved in 22.5% 2-hydroxypropyl-bcyclodextrin and given in a dose of 8 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection 1h and 6h after permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (pMCAO). Additional injections of 15 mg/kg were administered subcutaneously once a day after pMCAO. The expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and claudin5 was measured by western blot technique. Evan's blue extravasation and brain water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere was also detected to evaluate the permeability of BBB. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of TNF-alpha and MMP-9 were reduced while claudin5 was up-regulated in brain tissues of PROG-treated rats. In addition, examination of BBB permeability also showed that administration of PROG significantly reduced Evan's blue extravasation and brain water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared to vehicle-treated rats. Our findings reveal that PROG inhibited the inflammatory response after experimental stroke and mitigated the severity of brain damage, suggesting a role for PROG in the integrity of the BBB and subsequent edema formation following cerebral ischemia.",

The particle size distribution (PSD), surface morphology, structure, encapsulation parameters, release properties and the thermal stability of nanocapsules have been characterized using a laser particle size analyzer (LPSA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier infrared spectrum (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the nanocapsules have a smaller size (ca. 268 nm), regular sphericity, uniform particle size (polydispersity index, PDI=0.078), clear core-shell structure and smooth surface. When the ratio of LO to TDI trimer is 5:10, the yield, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of the nanocapsules can reach a maximum of 70.7%, 98.6%, and 64.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the release experiments showed that the cumulative release of LO from nanocapsules was only about 17% at room temperature and about 32% at 50°C even after 20 days.",

        "abstract": "Service-oriented wireless sensor networks have recently been proposed to provide an integrated platform, where new applications can be rapidly developed through flexible service composition. In wireless sensor networks, sensors are periodically switched into the sleep mode for energy saving. This, however, will cause the unavailability of nodes, which, in turn, incurs disruptions to the service compositions requested by the applications. Thus, it is desirable to maintain enough active sensors in the system to provide each required service at any time in order to achieve dependable service compositions for various applications. In this paper, we study the cross-layer sleep scheduling design, which aims to prolong the network lifetime while satisfying the service availability requirement at the application layer. We formally define the problem, prove that the problem is NP-hard, and develop two approximation algorithms based on the LP relaxation and one efficient reordering heuristic algorithm. The proposed work will enhance the dependability of the service composition in service-oriented wireless sensor networks. © 2006 IEEE.",

The cis and trans isomers, in terms of the position of two terminal C[triple bond, length as m-dash]O groups, are found to coexist in the two solvents. A weak asymmetric stretching peak of the cis-isomer is revealed under that of the IR-active trans-isomer by analyzing the 2D infrared cross peak, which is supported by ab initio computations. Furthermore, vibrational population relaxation is found to be both solute and solvent dependent (ranging from 21 ps to 32 ps) - the fastest dynamics is found for the trans-isomer in the polar solvent environment, which is believed to be associated with the availability and the number of efficient energy accepting channels for solvent molecules. The spectral diffusion dynamics of the C[triple bond, length as m-dash]O stretching vibrations, occurring on an even faster time scale (1 ps to 3 ps), mainly exhibits solvent dependence - faster dynamics is found in the polar solvent, involving weak and rapidly fluctuating hydrogen bonding interactions between CH2 groups of the solvent and the terminal carbonyls of solutes.",

        "abstract": "In the “network-as-a-service” paradigm, network operators have a strong need to know the metrics of critical paths running services to their users/tenants. However, it is usually prohibitive to directly measure the metrics of all such paths due to the measuring overhead. A practical solution is to use network tomography to infer the metrics of such paths based on observations from a small number of monitoring nodes. This problem is termed as path identifiability problem, a new problem that largely differs from existing link identifiability problems. we show that the new problem is harder than link identifiability problems, in the sense that fewer monitors are required for identifying the metrics of given paths than for identifying the metrics of links along the paths. To solve the problem, we develop sufficient and necessary conditions for the identifiability of a given set of interested paths, and design an efficient algorithm that deploys the minimum number of monitors. Experiments show a saving of up to 40% fewer monitors that guarantee the identifiability of a given set of paths.",

        "abstract": "Narrow-dispersed polyurethane (PU) nanocapsules containing lavender essential oil (LO) were fabricated by polyaddition of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) trimer with polyol using a phase inversion emulsification technique. The particle size distribution (PSD), surface morphology, structure, encapsulation parameters, release properties and the thermal stability of nanocapsules have been characterized using a laser particle size analyzer (LPSA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier infrared spectrum (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the nanocapsules have a smaller size (ca. 268 nm), regular sphericity, uniform particle size (polydispersity index, PDI=0.078), clear core-shell structure and smooth surface. When the ratio of LO to TDI trimer is 5:10, the yield, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of the nanocapsules can reach a maximum of 70.7%, 98.6%, and 64.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the release experiments showed that the cumulative release of LO from nanocapsules was only about 17% at room temperature and about 32% at 50°C even after 20 days.",

        "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) is a critical mediator of stress-activated protein kinase signals that regulate apoptosis, inflammations and tumorigenesis. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the MKK4 gene. We hypothesized that genetic variants in the MKK4 promoter may alter its expression and thus cancer risk. In a case-control study of 1056 lung cancer cases and 1056 sex and age frequency-matched cancer-free controls, we genotyped two common polymorphisms in the MKK4 promoter region (-1304T>G and -1044A>T) with the Taqman assay, and we found that compared with the most common -1304TT genotype, carriers of -1304G variant genotypes had a decreased risk of lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61-0.90 for TG, and OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.41-0.94 for GG] in an allele dose-response manner (adjusted P(trend) = 0.0005). Further stratification analysis showed that the protective role of the -1304G variant allele was more evident in low or normal body mass index (BMI) but restrained in the overweighters and that the -1304G variant genotypes interacted with BMI in reducing cancer risk (adjusted P(interaction) = 0.003). Moreover, the luciferase assay showed that the G allele in the promoter significantly increased the transcription activity of the MKK4 gene in vitro and that the MKK4 protein expression levels of the G variant carriers was significantly higher in tumor tissues than those of the -1304TT genotype. However, no significant association was observed between the -1044A>T polymorphism and risk of lung cancer. Our data suggest that the functional -1304G variant in the MKK4 promoter contributes to a decreased risk of lung cancer by increasing the promoter activity and that the G variant may be a marker for susceptibility to lung cancer.",

        "title": "ONU Placement in Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) Networks Considering Peer-to-Peer Communications",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) network is proposed as a hybrid access network that integrates optical access networks (e.g., PONs) with wireless access networks (e.g., WMNs) to provide the high bandwidth, cost-efficient and ubiquitous last mile Internet access. In FiWi networks, besides traffic from wireless mesh clients to the Internet, peer-to-peer communication from one wireless client to another wireless client is introduced due to the recent growth of applications such as multimedia transmissions within community areas. In FiWi networks, such peer-to-peer traffic can be carried either through the wireless path within the wireless mesh subnetwork or through the wireless-optical-wireless mode in which traffic firstly goes from the source client to its closest ONU, and then goes to the ONU closest to the destination client through the PON subnetwork and finally reaches the destination client. Such wireless-opticalwireless mode for peer-to-peer communications can alleviate interferences in the wireless subnetwork, thus improving the network throughput. Considering such mode for peer-to-peer communications, ONUs' placement will have great impact on the achievable network throughput in FiWi networks and will be different from the placement when only traffic to the Internet is considered. In this paper, given the distribution of wireless mesh routers, we study where to place K ONUs in FiWi networks so that the overall network throughput can be maximized when peer-to-peer communications are considered in addition to traffic destinated to the Internet. We first formulate the problem and then propose a tabu search (TS) based heuristic to solve the problem. Simulation results show that compared to the random deployment and the fixed deployment which performs well when only traffic to the Internet is considered, the tabu search heuristic has a much better performance.",

In order to simulate and predict the eutrophic status of the Miyun Reservoir and its watershed, an integrated model was developed based on GIS and RS technology, which was composed of non-point source (NFS) simulation model, aquatic ecological-hydrodynamic model, and river water quality model. Ecological-hydrodynamic model was developed through coupling water quality analysis simulation program (WASP) with environmental fluid dynamics Code (EFDC). SWAT was selected as NFS simulation model, which could also perform water quality simulation in the river. Then the integrated model was calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and verified using observed data. Results indicated that observed water quality data laid around the mode curves of simulation distribution, and which also dropped into the confidence interval on 80 percent credibility of water quality simulation distribution. In conclusion, the results show that the integrated model can meet the need of application.",

On this basis, the efficiency droop effect on the performance of a code division multiple access (CDMA) visible-light communication (VLC) system using GaN-based LEDs was also analyzed. The results reveal that the obvious transmitted signal error under the effect of LED efficiency droop leads to performance deterioration of multiuser CDMA VLC systems. Also, the performance of CDMA VLC systems is reduced with the user number increase due to LED efficiency droop. The bit error rate of a CDMA VLC system was further calculated for different branch signal levels and bias currents. It is demonstrated that the efficiency droop effect on the performance of CDMA VLC systems can be alleviated by adjusting the branch signal level and the bias current.",

        "abstract": "In recent years network coding has attracted significant attention in telecommunication. The benefits of network coding to a communication network include the increased throughput as well as secure data transmission. The purpose of this work is to design secure linear network coding against wiretap attack. The problem is to maximize the transmission data rate of multiple unicast streams between a pair of source and destination nodes, under the condition of satisfying the weakly secure requirements. Different from most existing research on network coding that designs the network coding scheme based on a given network topology, we will consider the integrated network topology design and network coding design. Such an integrated approach has not been reported by other researchers. In this paper, we formally introduce the problem, prove the problem is computational intractable, and then develop efficient heuristic algorithms. We first try to find the transmission topology that is suitable for network coding. Based on the topology, we design linear network coding scheme that is weakly secure. We conduct simulations to show that the proposed algorithms can achieve good performance.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pear fruit biological variability on robustness of FT-NIR models for sugar content of pears. The robustness of the calibration models for sugar content with respect to the three factors (orchard, season and cultivar) was tested based on FT-NIR spectroscopy and a statistical analysis was performed on a large spectral data set to analyze the effect of this three factors. Season and cultivar were responsible for a major amount of the spectral variability, whereas the influence of the orchard was low and only appeared for certain cultivars during specific seasons. It was found that the accuracy of the models increased considerably when including more variability in the calibration set. On the other hand, adding more data to the calibration set increased the chance of adding atypical data, which resulted in reduced model accuracy. Therefore, it is important to construct the calibration data set in such a way that it is representative for future measurements.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of supplemental saturated fatty acid on milk yield, components and fatty acid profile of mid-lactating cows during hot weather. A total of 48 Chinese Holstein cows were divided into three groups according to randomly block design by milk yield, days in milk (DIM, 150～210 d) and parity, and were fed isonitroenous diets containing 0 (SFA 0), 1.5% (SFA 1.5) and 3.0% (SFA 3.0) saturated fatty acid, respectively. The minimum temperature humidity index (TH1) was normally more than 72 during experimental period. Results showed that the milk yields were higher in SFA 1.5 and SFA 3.0 than those in SFA 0 (P<0. 05), and there was no difference between SFA 1.5 and SFA 3.0. The contents of milk fat and total solid in SFA 3.0 were higher than those in SFA 0 (P<0. 05), and there were no differences among treatments in milk protein, lactose, milk urea nitrogen and somatic cell score (P>0. 05). The contents of milk fat and total solid were increased linearly (P<0. 05) and milk protein was increased quadratically (P< 0. 05) by supplemental fatty acids. There were no differences among treatments in medium-chain, long-chain, long-chain unsaturated (LUFA), total unsaturated (TUFA), t10c12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), total saturated fatty acid and the ratio of LUFA to TUFA (P>0. 05). The contents of short-chain fatty acid in SFA 3.0 were lower than those in SFA 0 (P<0.01) and SFA 1.5 (P<0.05), but there was no difference between SFA 0 and SFA 1.5. Supplemental saturated fatty acid decreased linearly the contents of medium-chain fatty acid (P = 0. 03) and c9t11CLA (P<0.01). The contents of c9r11CLA in SFA 0, SFA 1.5 and SFA 3.0 were 0.72, 0.64 and 0.55 g/100 g fat acid methyl esters, respectively. It was concluded that milk yield, milk fat content and total solid were improved by supplemental saturated fatty acid. There was no effect of supplemental saturated fatty acid on milk fatty acid profile except that c9t11CLA was decreased within a normal level.",

The present study assessed the correlation between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the p38β promoter region (rs2235356, -1628A>G) and the predisposition of individuals to sporadic CRC in a case-control study. A genotyping method was developed to detect this SNP, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). It was revealed that the -1628G variant allele was correlated with an increased risk of CRC (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.60-2.47; P<0.0001). An in silico analysis revealed several transcription factors that either acquired or lost the ability to bind to -1628AA in the p38β promoter region due to the SNP. Therefore, this allelic variant may be a genetic modifier for CRC susceptibility.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Garment flats have a wide application in product development production and designing stages. However, the traditional drawing methods of garment flat are very time-consuming, and need professional drawing skills. In this paper, a parametric design method was proposed based on body dimension to draw garment flats. The relations among human body, flats and garment show that a garment flat has a close relation with human body and real garment. Graphic analysis shows that a garment flat is constrained by two kinds of parameters: geometric and dimensional parameters. Then, the parametric relation model between garment flat and human body dimensions was constructed. According to the parametric relation model, all the dimensions of a garment flat can be represented by several dimensional parameters and style parameters. Finally, an application program (JFRS, 2016) based on the proposed method was developed to generate garment flats. The result shows that the proposed method is more effective than traditional methods. Moreover, the engineering design methods have been successfully applied to improve design efficiency in artistic design in this research. This is a novel research idea in the field of fashion design, and could be further applied in other design domains.",

Radical excision (D2, D3 or D4) combining splenectomy for gastric cancer was performed in 45 cases. 343 cases were selected simultaneously for comparison according to the resembling rules in sex, age, tumor size, location, serosa invasion, Borrmann type and range of lymph node dissection. Clinicopathological factors affecting lymph node metastasis, patterns of lymph node metastasis, 5-year survival rate after radical excision combined with splenectomy for gastric cancer were compared.Lymph node metastasis rate of splenic hilus was 15.6 percent. Among them, upper, middle and lower domain is 11.5 percent, 33.3 percent and zero respectively. It was significantly different between gastric adenocarcinoma in proximal and body of stomach and that in distal stomach, poor differentiation and adenocarcinoma anaplastic and well and moderately differentiation adenocarcinoma, Borrmann III and IV types and Borrmann I and II types, infiltrated depth in T(3) and T(4) and infiltrated depth in T(1) and T(2), clinical stages III and IV and clinical stages I and II. The average and median survival time between radical gastrectomy only and radical gastrectomy combining splenectomy for gastric cancer at stage I and II patients were significantly different, but at stage III and IV patients not significantly different.Spleen should be reserved for patients with gastric cancer at stage I and II, and radical excision combining splenectomy could only be performed at stage III and IV patients with cancer infiltrating body and tail of the pancreas, or lymph nodes metastasis in the splenic hilus. Indication of radical excision combining splenectomy for gastric cancer must be further study to clarify its efficacy.",

        "abstract": "A simple, highly-automated instrument system used for on-site detection of foodborne pathogens based on fluorescence was designed, fabricated, and preliminarily tested in this paper. A corresponding method has been proved effective in our previous studies. This system utilizes a light-emitting diode (LED) to excite fluorescent labels and a spectrometer to record the fluorescence signal from samples. A rotation stage for positioning and switching samples was innovatively designed for high-throughput detection, ten at most in one single run. We also developed software based on LabVIEW for data receiving, processing, and the control of the whole system. In the test of using a pure quantum dot (QD) solution as a standard sample, detection results from this home-made system were highly-relevant with that from a well-commercialized product and even slightly better reproducibility was found. And in the test of three typical kinds of food-borne pathogens, fluorescence signals recorded by this system are highly proportional to the variation of the sample concentration, with a satisfied limit of detection (LOD) (nearly 10²-10³ CFU·mL in food samples). Additionally, this instrument system is low-cost and easy-to-use, showing a promising potential for on-site rapid detection of food-borne pathogens.",

        "abstract": "The spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has been reported as a novel biomarker for human hepatocellular carcinoma, but the functional contributions of its two isoforms SYK(L) and SYK(S) are undefined. In this study, we investigated their biologic functions and possible prognostic values in hepatocellular carcinoma. SYK(L) was downregulated in 38% of human specimens of hepatocellular carcinoma examined, whereas SYK(S) was detectable in 40% of these specimens but not in normal liver tissue samples without cirrhosis. SYK(S) expression correlated with pathologic parameters characteristic of tumor metastasis, including multiple tumors (P = 0.003) and vascular invasion (P = 0.001). Further, SYK(S) was specifically associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens. Functional studies showed that SYK(S) promoted tumor growth, suppressed apoptosis, and induced EMT through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, countering the opposite effects of SYK(L). Patients with SYK(L(+)/S(-)) tumors exhibited longer overall survival and time to recurrence than those with SYK(L(-)/S(-)) or SYK(L(+)/S(+)) tumors (P < 0.001). Taken together, our findings showed that SYK(S) enhances invasion, whereas SYK(L) inhibits metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma. We suggest that SYK(L) downregulation or SYK(S) elevation are strong predictors of poor survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, indicative of a need for aggressive therapeutic intervention.",

MWCNTs were dropped on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to immobilize the anti-TET aptamer and to construct the aptasensor. The stepwise assembly process of the aptasensor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. Results demonstrated that the peak currents of Fe(CN) 6 3-/Fe(CN) 6 4- redox pair decreased due to the formation of anti-TET/TET complexes on the modified electrode. The optimization of the loading amount of MWCNTs, the incubating conditions of aptamer and the detection time of TET were investigated in details. Under optimal conditions, the peak currents change obtained by DPV increased linearly with the increasing TET concentrations in the range from 1 × 10 -8 M to 5 × 10 -5 M with a linear coefficiency of 0.995. This electrochemical aptasensor has a detection limit of 5 × 10 -9 M and was successfully applied to the determination of TET in spiked milk samples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "For many emerging mobile broadband services and applications, the source and destination are located in the same local region. Consequently, it is very important to design access networks to facilitate efficient local data exchange. In the past few years, most existing studies focus on either the wired or wireless domains. In this paper, we aim to exploit both the wired and wireless domains. Specifically, we consider a Fiber-Wireless access network in which a passive optical network (PON) connects densely deployed base stations. In such a scenario, we propose a novel access scheme, namely, NCDA, where the main idea is to utilize both network coding and device association. To understand the potentials of NCDA, we first formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to minimize the weighted number of packet transmissions (WNT), which is related to both the system capacity and energy consumption. We then theoretically analyze the tight upper bounds of the minimal WNT in the PON, which helps us to approximate the original problem by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Next, we develop efficient algorithms based on linear programming relaxation to solve the optimal NCDA problem. To validate our design, we conduct extensive simulation experiments, which demonstrate the impact of important network parameters and the promising potentials of the proposed scheme.",

Considering the debate about the core symptom of OCD, researchers proposed that it’s necessary to reconsiderate the relationship among the OCD, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder and hoarding disorder. Furture research should identify the core symptoms of OCD in the perspective of cognitive neuroscience and provide a basis for the OCD diagnostic standard.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the characteristics of lymph node metastases in advanced gastric cancer and its clinical significance.From April 2002 to July 2003, we studied 91 patients with advanced gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy from which specimens were obtained during surgery. Then, collection of dissected lymph node, histopathological and immunohistological studies were performed to detect the lymph node metastasis rates and calculation. In addition, to analyze the relationship between lymph node metastasis rates and tumor diameters, TNM classification, Borrmann analysis, tumor localization and the extent of lymph node resection.Among 91 patients with advanced gastric cancer, lymph node metastases were found in 63 patients (69.2%) with a total collection of 3149 lymph nodes and an average of 34.6 lymph nodes collected per patient. Lymph node metastasis rate was lower in tumor < 3 cm than that in tumor >3 cm. About TNM classification, lymph node metastases in advanced gastric cancer among patients in stage IIIa and stage IV was 100%, with the lymph node metastasis rates varying from 30.3% to 58.4%, which were significantly higher than that among patients in stage I and II (P<0.001). About Borrmann classification, lymph nodes metastasis in advanced gastric cancer among patients in Borrmann type III (79.6%) was higher than other Borrmann types, while in Borrmann type IV with the highest lymph node metastasis rate of 35.3% (P<0.05). Patients undergone lymph node dissection D(3) had higher lymph node metastases among patients and higher lymph node metastasis rate (88.2%, 38.0%) than patients in the D(1) and D(2) (P<0.05). Among 91 patients, 17 patients was found with micrometastasis (18.7%) from which 183 lymph nodes was collected, but no statistically significant difference between tumor location and micrometastasis was found (P>0.05). For tumor localization, lymph node metastases in proximal gastric cancer were more shown in station 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16, with the highest metastasis rate in station 8 (68.1%). Lymph node metastases in middle gastric cancer were more shown in station 1, 3, 7, 12, 13 and 16, with the highest metastasis rate in station 3 (47.6%). Lymph node metastases in distal gastric cancer were more shown in station 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16, with the highest metastasis rate in station 16 (83.3%).Metastasis among patients and lymph node metastasis rates are significantly correlated with the severity of gastric malignancy and they may be valuable guideline to evaluate the extension of lymph nodes dissection in gastric cancer.",

In addition, we compared the effects of BM-MNCs and microglia on infarct volume, brain water content, and functional outcome after permanent cerebral ischemia. BM-MNCs and microglia were obtained from femur and brain, respectively, of newborn rats. Adult rats were injected with vehicle or 3 million BM-MNCs or microglia via the tail vein 24h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). The distribution or morphologic characteristics of transplanted BM-MNCs (double stained with BrdU/Cd34 or BrdU/CD45) and microglia (double stained with BrdU/Iba-1) were detected with immunofluorescent staining at 3 or 7 and 14 days after pMCAO. Functional deficits were assessed by the modified neurologic severity score at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after pMCAO. Brain water content was assessed at 3 days, and infarct volume was determined at 14 days. We observed more BrdU/CD45 and BrdU/Iba-1 double-stained cells than BrdU/CD34 double-stained cells around the infarcted area. Some infused microglia showed the morphology of innate microglia at 7 days after pMCAO, and the number increased at 14 days. BM-MNC-treated rats showed significantly reduced infarct volume and brain water content compared to vehicle- and microglia-treated rats. In addition, BM-MNC treatment reduced neurologic deficit scores compared to those in the other groups. The results provide evidence that infusion of BM-MNCs, but not microglia, is neuroprotective after permanent cerebral ischemia.",

Objective: To analyze the stress magnitude and distribution of remaining dentin and parodontium in mandibular first molar short crown restored with post inlay using three-dimensional finite element method. And then to discuss the rational core design of occlusal surface of mandibular first molar short crown. Methods: The three-dimensional element models of mandibular first molar short crown restored with post inlay were created by CT scanning, Mimics software and Unigraphics NX6.0 software. Different cuspal inclination of post was used in the modeling, including post inlay, crown, root, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. A load of 240 N was applied to the occlusal surface in order to analyze the maximum principal stress, Von-mises peak stress and distribution of remaining dentin in mandibular first molar short crown restored with post inlay. Results and Conclusion: The maximum stress on remaining dentin and parodontium increased markedly with the increasing of different cuspal inclination. Cuspal inclination has influence on magnitude and distribution of stress on remaining dentin and parodontium in mandibular first molar short crown restored with post inlay.",

        "abstract": "The Hashitu Mo deposit was discovered recently in the middle section of the Da Hinggan Montain district. The ore body occurs in granite intrusion and this deposit is regarded as an endogenic metallic ore deposit related to acid magmatism. The metallic minerals are composed of molybdenite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and arsenopyrite, etc. The fluid inclusions study demonstrates that inclusion types mainly involve liquid inclusion (Ia type), gaseous inclusion (Ib type), daughter crystal inclusion (Ic type) and melt inclusion (II type). Co-existence of different inclusion types indicates the fluid boiling. The heating and freezing study shows that homogenization temperature of fluid and melt inclusions ranges 250~500 °C and 750~950 °C, respectively. The calculation of fluid salinity, pressure and density indicates that these values range 1%~49% NaCl eqv, 5~100 MPa and 0.7~1.1 g/cm3, respectively. The fluid inclusion study indicates that ore forming fluid are characterized by high temperature, high salinity, high pressure, high-moderate density and CO2 bearing, which can be classified as H2O-NaCl-CO2-SO4 2- system. δ34Sv-cdt(‰) values of sulfides and δ34SH2S(‰) values of ore forming fluid range from 0.4‰ to 3.8‰ and 1.1‰ to 4.7‰, respectively. These isotopic values indicate that mineralization is related with magmatism in this region. Both fluid boiling and mixing are identified in ore forming fluid evolution and fluid boiling resulting in pressure decrease was the mainly mechanism for sulfide minerals deposition form hydrothermal fluid. Discovery of the Hashitu Mo deposit in this region is helpful to the exploration of other magmatic-hydrothermal Mo-W-Cu-Pb-Zn-Au deposits. More attention should be paid to the contact and intersection parts between intrusions and other host rocks, intrusions and structural zones in future mining exploration.",

        "abstract": "Mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-5 (MEK5), which belongs to a network of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether variants in the MEK5 gene promoter were involved in susceptivity of individuals to sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present hospital-based case-control study of 737 patients with sporadic CRC and 703 healthy control subjects in a southern Chinese population, the two polymorphisms of MEK5 promoter (i.e., rs7172582C>T and rs3743354T>C) were genotyped by TaqMan assay. There were significant differences between cases and controls in the genotype and allele distribution of the MEK5 gene rs3743354T>C polymorphism. The rs3743354 CC genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of CRC when compared with the TT genotype (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]=0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.77). Compared to the T allele, a significant correlation was detected between the presence of the C allele and decreased risk of CRC (adjusted OR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-0.94). The decreased risk of CRC associated with rs3743354 variant genotypes (i.e., CT+CC) was found in the smoker subgroup (adjusted OR=0.63; 95% CI=0.45-0.88). Further, environmental factors, including smoking and drinking, interacted with rs3743354C variant genotypes to reduce CRC risk. Western blot analysis showed that the levels of MEK5 protein in sporadic CRC neoplastic tissues and adjacent normal colorectal epithelium tissues were lower in the carriers of rs3743354 CC genotypes than that in those with rs3743354 TT genotypes or those with rs3743354 TC genotypes. However, no significant association was found between the rs7172582C>T polymorphism and risk of CRC. These data indicate that the rs3743354 polymorphism in the MEK5 promoter may affect the risk of developing CRC.",

        "abstract": "To observe the gene silencing and disruption of WNT pathway mediated by the specific shRNA targeted against beta-catenin and its effect on cell proliferation of the human colon cancer cell line Colo205.The shRNA plasmid vectors against beta-catenin were constructed and transfected into Colo205 cells with Lipofectamine 2000. The expression of beta-catenin was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Immunofluorescence staining was also performed to detect the beta-catenin protein expression in cells. The cell proliferation inhibition was determined by MTT assay and soft agar colony formation assay.The shRNA vectors targeted against beta-catenin were successfully constructed and efficiently suppressed the expression of beta-catenin mRNA and protein(P<0.05). The expression inhibition rates were 47.89% and 45.26% at the mRNA and protein level respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated the inhibition of beta-catenin protein induced by these specific shRNAs. The MTT assay indicated that the specific shRNA resulted in significant inhibition of cell growth on the culture plates in time-dependent manner. At 72 h post-transfection, the cell viability of CAT group was 48.5%, which was significantly different as compared with that of blank control group's 91.3%(P<0.05). In the soft agar, there were 9, 46, 43 cell colonies in the CAT, blank, and negative control groups respectively, which were significantly different(P<0.05).The specific shRNAs targeted against beta-catenin has a gene silencing effect and blocks the WNT signaling pathway, which can inhibit the growth of Colo205 cells.",

        "abstract": "To protect user privacy, many smartphone systems adopt the permission-based mechanism in which a user can evaluate the risk of requests for private information from a mobile app before installing it. However, recent studies show that the permission based mechanism is vulnerable to application collusion attacks because two apps, which appear to be harmless individually, can establish a covert channel and use it to leak confidential information. Consequently, people have designed some covert channel detection schemes, by checking abnormal status of the phone. In this paper, we point out that existing covert channel detection schemes may fail to detect a new type of collusion attacks referred as user-behavior-based covert channels. We implement three covert channels on Android smartphones. Our work sets a new alarm for the security issue of using smartphones. We then study the countermeasures to this new type of covert channels. Instead of trying to directly detect the proposed new type of covert channels, we propose two mitigation solutions to reduce the effectiveness of such covert channels. The mitigation solutions are also valid to other existing sensor-based side channels and/or covert channels on the phone.",

        "abstract": "In an integrated fiber and wireless access (FiWi) network, multi-path forwarding may be applied in the wireless subnetwork to improve throughput. Due to the delay difference along multiple paths, reordered packets of a flow may arrive at the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) waiting for dispatching to the Internet, which may deteriorate the TCP performance. As all traffic in a FiWi network is sent out through the OLT, the OLT serves as a convergence node which naturally makes it possible to resequence packets at the OLT before they are sent to the Internet. The fundamental difference between resequencing at the end systems and resequencing at an intermediate node (e.g., the OLT) is that very tight resequencing delay can be tolerated in the latter. Thus, resequencing at the intermediate nodes must be fast enough. In this paper, we propose an integrated flow assignment and resequencing approach which jointly determines the probability of sending packets along each path from the source and needs virtually zero resequencing delay at the OLT to reduce the out-of-order probability when packets are injected to the Internet from the access network. Simulation results validate our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed integrated flow assignment and resequencing approach.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal liver metastases (CLM) occur frequently and postoperative intestinal infection is a common complication. Our previous study showed that probiotics could decrease the rate of infectious complications after colectomy for colorectal cancer. To determine the effects of the perioperative administration of probiotics on serum zonulin levels which is a marker of intestinal permeability and the subsequent impact on postoperative infectious complications in patients with CLM.150 patients with CLM were randomly divided into control group (n = 68) and probiotics group (n = 66). Probiotics and placebo were given orally for 6 days preoperatively and 10 days postoperatively to control group and probiotics group respectively. We used the local resection for metastatic tumor ,while for large tumor, the segmental hepatectomy. Postoperative outcome were recorded. Furthermore, complications in patients with normal intestinal barrier function and the relation with serum zonulin were analyzed to evaluate the impact on the liver barrier dysfunction.The incidence of infectious complications in the probiotics group was lower than control group. Analysis of CLM patients with normal postoperative intestinal barrier function paralleled with the serum zonulin level. And probiotics could also reduce the concentration of serum zonulin (P = 0.004) and plasma endotoxin (P < 0.001).Perioperative probiotics treatment could reduce the serum zonulin level, the rate of postoperative septicemia and maintain the liver barrier in patients undergoing CLM surgery. we propose a new model about the regulation of probiotics to liver barrier via clinical regulatory pathway. We recommend the preoperative oral intake of probiotics combined with postoperative continued probiotics treatment in patients who undergo CLM surgery.ChiCTR-TRC- 12002841 . 2012/12/21.",

The binding of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis. This study was to investigate the interrelation of VEGF-C, VEGFR-3 and lymphangial density (LAD), and to identify their correlations to clinicopathologic factors of colorectal cancer.The tissue microarrays containing 105 cases of colorectal cancer and 105 cases of normal colorectal tissue were produced separately. The expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry; LAD was assessed through Podoplanin immunohistochemical staining.The positive rates of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3, and LAD were significantly higher in colorectal cancer than in normal colorectal tissue (61.0% vs. 22.8%, P<0.01; 55.2% vs. 20.0%, P<0.01; 8.91+/-3.75 vs. 6.68+/-1.38, P<0.01). The expression of VEGF-C had no correlation to that of VEGFR-3. LAD was significantly higher in VEGF-C-positive colorectal cancer than in VEGF-C-negative colorectal cancer (10.89+/-3.36 vs. 5.83+/-1.67, P<0.01). VEGF-C was up-regulated in colorectal cancer at Dukes'C stage, or with lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis; VEGFR-3 was up-regulated and LAD was higher in colorectal cancer at Dukes'C stage, or with lymph node metastasis.VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 are related with the lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic metastasis, and progression of colorectal cancer.",

Thus, the problem of efficiently mapping a VI to a substrate while guaranteeing the VI's survivability in the event of failures in the substrate becomes important. In this paper, we investigate various survivable virtual infrastructure mapping approaches and algorithms to recover from physical server failures, physical link failures and regional failures. To improve the backup resource efficiency, the paper further discusses the sharing schemes of multiple VI requests.",

        "abstract": "Quantum mechanical computations and molecular dynamics simulations are carried out for the simplest sugar glycolaldehyde to gain insight into the underlying force fields that determine the vibrational spectroscopic parameters relevant to structure and dynamics. The harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies of the 3N--6 modes and their diagonal and off-diagonal anharmonicities are evaluated using the hybrid B3LYP functional in comparison with other high-level theories. Very good performance of B3LYP/6-31+G** is found in predicting the anharmonic frequencies by statistical analysis and by comparison to gas-phase experiments. Full cubic and semidiagonal quartic anharmonic force constants, the origin of the anharmonicities, the isotope dependence of the anharmonicities, and the polarizable continuum solvent effect on the anharmonicities are examined, in particular, for the CO, C-H, and O-H stretching modes. Site-dependent dynamical interactions between glycolaldehyde and water molecules in the hydration shells are examined by molecular dynamics simulations employing a set of molecular mechanical force fields developed on the basis of quantum mechanical computations. The statistical distributions and correlations of the fundamental transition frequencies and transition dipoles are obtained through instantaneous normal-mode analysis. The simultaneous assessment of multiple parameters of multiple vibrational probes shall prove useful in understanding the characteristics of sugar structure and dynamics expressed in two-dimensional infrared correlation spectra.",

        "abstract": "Tripartite motif-containing protein 65 (TRIM65) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a critical regulator of a variety of cellular processes as well as tumor progression. Therefore, more substrates must be identified in the physiology or disease context. Here, we found that TRIM65 is upregulated and associated with poor survival in colorectal cancer (CRC). More specifically, high expression of TRIM65 is associated with CRC metastasis and recurrence. Ectopic overexpression of TRIM65 in CRC cell lines enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration, while knockdown of TRIM65 expression had the opposite effects. Furthermore, we identified a new substrate of TRIM65, namely ARHGAP35, a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is involved in polarized cell migration. Phenotypically, forced expression of TRIM65 induces increased production of migration-related structures, focal adhesions, and/or filopodia and enhances CRC metastasis to the liver or the lung in a mouse model. Mechanistic studies revealed that TRIM65 mediates ubiquitination of ARHGAP35, whose degradation leads to elevated Rho GTPase activity. In addition, we identified several phosphorylation sites on TRIM65. In sum, we reveal a novel TRIM65-GAP-Rho regulatory axis that modulates the actin cytoskeleton and the migration behavior of CRC cells, and the TRIM65-ARHGAP35 interaction might be a valuable therapeutic target in CRC.",

        "abstract": "The Jiashengpan lead-zinc-sulfur deposit is located in the Langshan-Zhaertaishan mineralization belt on the northern margin of the North China Platform.Its ore bodies are hosted in black shale strata of the Mesoproterozoic Zhaertaishan Group.Lead isotopic composition of sulfides in ores can be classified into two groups(Group A and Group B).Group A is characterized by lower radiogenic lead with 206Pb/204Pb ranging from 15.889 to 16.257,207Pb/204Pb ranging from 15.158 to 15.455,and 208Pb/204Pb ranging from 35.112 to 36.271,whereas Group B is characterized by higher radiogenic lead with 206Pb/204Pb ranging from 17.871 to 18.990,207Pb/204Pb ranging from 15.509 to 15.672,and 208Pb/204Pb ranging from 37.525 to 38.770.It is evident that the sulfides in ores can be divided into the early depositional ones having fine-grained,layered and disseminated features and the later ones having coarse-grained and veinlike features.Both of them contain lead isotope compositions of Group A and Group B,but the former consists mainly of the features of Group A whereas the latter consists mainly of the features of Group B.Based on tectonic patterns of lead isotope and related parameters,it can be concluded that the lead of Group A was mainly derived from the upper crust and the orogenic belt with the participation of some mantle-derived lead.The ore-forming materials of Group A were derived from the old basement strata during the main ore-forming period,whereas the lead of Group B was mainly derived from the late hydrothermal event with some influence of the Varisian granite to the north of the ore bodies.The lead of the Jiashengpan ore deposit has a multi-source mixing structure.",

The performance of such a network is mainly determined by the capacity (bandwidth) of its links, and the latency of transmit- ted data encountered at intermediate nodes, which include bridges, switches, routers, gateways, etc. These nodes are referred to as switching nodes, or simply switches, in the rest of this paper. Emerg- ing service-oriented applications require the Internet to provide ser- vice of high communication performance. These applications include, but are not limited to, distributed supercomputing, high-throughput computing, on-demand computing, data-intensive computing and collaborative computing. In order to ensure quality of services (QoS), link bandwidth has to be increased and utilized efficiently, and data transmission delays have to be minimized. Optical dense wavelength- division multiplexing (DWDM) is the way to alleviate the bandwidth issue. However, replacing metal wires by optical fibers in a one-to- one fashion alone cannot solve the packet delay problem because of excessive operations (queuing, routing, switching, scheduling, etc.) involved in packet forwarding. New switching/routing techniques should be developed for node equipment to efficiently use link bandwidth and improve end-to-end communication quality. n 1 2 n 3 n 4 n T R T R T R T R n 1 2 n 3 n 4 n n 1 2 n 3 n 4 n",

The 5- and 10-year survival rates in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer was 43.9% and 28.1% (P=0.000), respectively. Among patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, the 5- and 10-year survival rates of the patients underwent second radical resection were 50.2% and 32.7%, while the 5- and 10-year survival rates of the patients without second surgery were 25.8% and 0, respectively (P=0.000). On univariate analysis, postoperative recurrence was associated with age at diagnosis, cancerous ileus, ascites, lymphs nodes involvement, gross types, infiltration of tumor and Duke's stage. Multivariate analysis revealed that cancerous ileus, ascites, gross types and Duke's stage were independent predictive factors for postoperative recurrence.Cancerous ileus, ascites, gross types and Duke's stage were independent predictive factors for recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer after radical resection. The 5- and 10-year survival rates and quality of life could be improved by second radical resection.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly available for mission-critical applications such as emergency management and health care. To meet the stringent requirements on communication performance, it is crucial to understand the complex wireless interference among sensor nodes. Recent empirical studies suggest that the packet-level interference model, also referred to as the packet reception ratio (PRR) versus SINR model or PRR-SINR model, offers significantly improved realism than other simplistic models such as the disc model. However, as shown in our experimental results, the PRR-SINR model yields considerable spatial and temporal variations in reality, which poses a major challenge for accurate measurement at run time. This paper presents a novel accuracy-aware approach to interference modeling and measurement for WSNs. First, we propose a new regression-based PRR-SINR model and analytically characterize its accuracy based on statistics theory. Second, we develop a novel protocol called accuracy-aware interference measurement (AIM) for measuring the proposed PRR-SINR model with assured accuracy at run time. AIM also adopts new clock calibration and in-network aggregation techniques to reduce the overhead of interference measurement. Our extensive experiments on a 17-node testbed of TelosB motes show that AIM achieves high accuracy of PRR-SINR modeling with significantly lower overhead than state of the art approaches.",

        "abstract": "With the advances of Internet of Things technologies, individual vehicles can now exchange information to improve traffic safety, and some vehicles can further improve safety and efficiency by coordinating their mobility via cooperative driving. To facilitate these applications, many studies have been focused on the design of inter-vehicle message dissemination protocols. However, most existing designs either assume individual driving pattern or consider cooperative driving only. Moreover, few of them fully exploit infrastructures, such as cameras, sensors, and road-side units. In this paper, we address the design of message dissemination that supports heterogeneous driving patterns. Specifically, we first propose an infrastructure-assisted message dissemination framework that can utilize the capability of infrastructures. We then present a novel beacon scheduling algorithm that aims at guaranteeing the timely and reliable delivery of both periodic beacon messages for cooperative driving and event-triggered safety messages for individual driving. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we develop both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. Extensive numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.",

        "abstract": "The fast development of mobile networks calls for the massive consumption of materials, land, and energy in building and maintaining infrastructures, which is always intensified by the repetitive constructions of competing network operators. To reduce the resource consumption for social benefit, one business solution, implemented in the Chinese telecom industry, is forming a joint venture responsible for building and maintaining common infrastructures. The novelty of this practice is that the joint venture is shared by the competing operators who also rent infrastructures from the joint venture. We note that such a solution can be potentially generalized to other industries for reducing resource consumption. However, before generalization, an understanding of the pros and cons from the economic perspective of the business model is urgently needed. In this paper, we study this business model from a game theoretic approach. Our results show that if we properly regulate the joint venture, the market can converge to equilibriums with desirable properties which cannot be achieved without the joint venture. Furthermore, we also study the investment reduction in the presence of the joint venture. Our numerical results show that under a moderate user density, the total investment on the infrastructures can be significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "The experiment was conducted to investigate the bioavailability of manganese (Mn) from humate-Mn complex relative to Mn sulphate for the starter broilers fed a conventional corn-soya bean meal diet. A total of 560 1-day-old Arbor Acres male broiler chicks were randomly allotted to one of eight replicate cages (10 chicks per cage) for each of seven treatments in a completely randomized design involving a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with two Mn sources (humate-Mn and Mn sulphate) and three levels of added Mn (60, 120 or 180 mg Mn/kg) plus a Mn-unsupplemented control diet containing 27.23 mg Mn/kg by analysis. At 14 days of age, the blood, liver, heart and tibia were collected for Mn analyses, and the activity and mRNA abundance of heart manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The results showed that humate-Mn supplementation decreased feed intake from day 1 to day 14, whereas it did not influence (p > 0.20) body weight at day 14 as compared to Mn sulphate. The Mn source did not influence Mn concentration in the liver, heart and tibia, and the activity and mRNA abundance of heart MnSOD, while humate-Mn decreased plasma Mn as compared to Mn sulphate. The Mn concentration in the plasma and heart, and the activity and mRNA abundance of heart MnSOD increased linearly as dietary Mn concentration increased. Based on slope ratios from multiple linear regressions of Mn concentrations in the plasma and heart, and the activity and mRNA abundance of heart MnSOD on daily intake amount of dietary analysed Mn, the bioavailability of humate-Mn complex relative to Mn sulphate (100%) was 82.8, 90.4, 82.8 and 81.9 respectively. These results indicated that the Mn from humate-Mn complex was just as bioavailable as the Mn from Mn sulphate for the starter broilers (day 1-14).",

        "abstract": "Linear network coding (LNC) is a promising approach to facilitate anonymity in information diffusion because each packet is generated by linearly combining multiple incoming packets. Since the coefficients used in the linear combination would reveal the correlation between incoming and outgoing packets at a node, most existing studies on anonymous LNC design focus on encrypting these coefficients. Despite the importance of these studies, the correlation of coded content can still be analyzed and the potential of un-encrypted LNC has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we tackle these issues and we propose a novel ALNCode scheme that can enhance anonymity by generating outgoing packets that are correlated to incoming coded packets of multiple flows. With solid theoretical analysis, we first prove the probability that incoming coded packets from different flows are correlated. Then, we prove that, if such correlation exists, we can design deterministic LNC to obfuscate the correlation of packets. With the same condition, we also prove the probability that a randomly generated coded packet is correlated to coded packets in other flows. Besides the theoretical study, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to understand the impacts of various coding parameters and the performance of ALNCode in real scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a promising nonthermal food preservation technology that is based on the use of electric field to eradicate spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food products. The effect of various biological factors on the transmembrane potential of different microorganisms (,  DH5α, and ) was investigated by means of both numerical simulation and experimental method. The PEF resistance of different microorganisms in grape juice was compared by applying field strength of 12–24 kV/cm, treatment time of 30–180 μs, and an initial temperature of 30 ºC. The results showed that  exhibited the least resistance to PEF treatment,  DH5α the second, and  the third. The simulation results indicated that larger cells like  presented the higher values of transmembrane potential and induced field strength around the cells compared to  DH5α and , which led to a less resistance to PEF treatment. The effect of cell orientation on the induced transmembrane potential was very slight (1.67 % for  DH5α and 3.43 % for ). The thicker cell membrane caused concentrated electric field in the cell membrane, which enhanced the sensitivity of microorganism to PEF treatment. However, both transmembrane potential and electric field strength decreased with the thickness of cell wall increasing. According to both experimental and simulation results, it was evident that there was significant difference in the inactivation rate between different microorganisms, which could be largely attributed to the biological factors of different microorganisms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The purpose of this study was to determine the nutrient composition and AME n  content of corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) to develop prediction equations for AME n  in laying hens. Ten samples of DDGS ranging in ether extract (EE) from 21.8 to 177.8 g/kg (DM basis) were selected and were subsequently fed to laying hens to determine AME n  content. A total of 176 62-week-old laying hens (Lohmann-Pink) were placed in metabolic cages (2 hens/cage) and were allotted into 11 dietary treatments (8 cages per treatment) according to hen-day egg production. Dietary treatments included a corn-soybean meal reference diet and 10 test diets. Each test diet was created by mixing the reference diet with 200 g/kg one of 10 DDGS samples at the expense of the energy-yielding ingredients (139.6 g/kg corn, 59.0 g/kg soybean meal, and 1.4 g/kg rapeseed oil).  Experimental diets were fed in the 7-day adaptation period, followed by the 4-day total excreta collection period. Gross energy (GE) and crude protein (CP) of the experimental diets and excreta were determined to calculate AME n  for each DDGS sample. On the DM basis, AME n  of the 10 corn DDGS samples ranged from 729 to 2535 kcal/kg. Analyses were conducted to determine the GE, CP, EE, DM, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and ash content of the DDGS samples. Stepwise regression resulted in the following best-fit equation for AME n  (DM basis) based on the coefficient of determination, SE, and the Mallows’ statistic (Cp): AME n , kcal/kg = 0.777 × GE (kcal/kg) − 5.39 × NDF (g/kg) (R 2  = 0.99; SE = 172; C p  = −3.37). These results suggested that the composition of corn DDGS may be used to predict AME n  in laying hens.",

        "abstract": "In most existing wireless networks, end users obtain data content from the wired network, typically, the Internet. In this manner, virtually all of their traffic must go through a few access points, which implies that the capacity of wireless network is limited by the aggregated transmission data rate of these access points. To fully exploit the capability of wireless network, we envision that future wireless networks shall be able to provide data content within themselves. In this paper, we address the behavior of such networks from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, we consider that multicast is used for distributed content delivery, and we investigate the asymptotic upper bound of the throughput capacity for distributed content delivery in large-scale wireless ad hoc networks (DCD-WANET). Our analysis shows how the upper bound of throughput capacity is affected by the geometric size of the network, the number of data items, the popularity of the data content, and the number of storage nodes that contain those data items. In particular, our theoretical results show that, if the number of storage nodes exceed a critical threshold, the upper bound grows with the number of storage nodes, according to a power-law where the scaling exponent depends on the popularity of data items. We also provide the data item placement strategy to achieve the upper bound of throughput capacity for DCD-WANET. © 2012 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Real-time detection is an important requirement of many mission-critical wireless sensor network applications such as battlefield monitoring and security surveillance. Due to the high network deployment cost, it is crucial to understand and predict the real-time detection capability of a sensor network. However, most existing real-time analyses are based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of detection. In practice, data fusion has been adopted in a number of sensor systems to deal with sensing uncertainty and enable efficient collaboration among resource-limited sensors. However, real-time performance analysis of sensor networks designed based on data fusion has received little attention. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the fundamental real-time detection performance of large-scale sensor networks under stochastic sensing models. In particular, we consider two basic data fusion schemes, i.e., value fusion and decision fusion. Our results show that data fusion is effective in achieving stringent performance requirements such as short detection delay and low false alarm rates. Moreover, value fusion and decision fusion are suitable for low and high signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, respectively. Our results help understand the impact of data fusion and provide important guidelines for the design of real-time wireless sensor networks for intrusion detection. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection. The results show that data fusion can reduce the network density by about 60 percent compared with the disc model while detecting any intruder within one detection period at a false alarm rate lower than five percent.",

        "abstract": "Human replication factor C4 (RFC4) is involved in DNA replication as a clamp loader and is aberrantly regulated across a range of cancers. The current study aimed to investigate the function of RFC4 in colorectal cancer (CRC).The mRNA levels of RFC4 were assessed in 30 paired primary CRC tissues and matched normal colonic tissues by quantitative PCR. The protein expression levels of RFC4 were evaluated by western blotting (n = 16) and immunohistochemistry (IHC; n = 49), respectively. Clinicopathological features and survival data were correlated with the expression of RFC4 by IHC analysis in a tissue microarray comprising 331 surgically resected CRC. The impact of RFC4 on cell proliferation and the cell cycle was assessed using CRC cell lines.RFC4 expression was significantly increased in CRC specimens as compared to adjacent normal colonic tissues (P <0.05). High levels of RFC4, determined on a tissue microarray, were significantly associated with differentiation, an advanced stage by the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system, and a poor prognosis, as compared to low levels of expression (P <0.05). However, in multivariate analysis, RFC4 was not an independent predictor of poor survival for CRC. In vitro studies, the loss of RFC4 suppressed CRC cell proliferation and induced S-phase cell cycle arrest.RFC4 is frequently overexpressed in CRC, and is associated with tumor progression and worse survival outcome. This might be attributed to the regulation of CRC cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest by RFC4.",

        "abstract": "The Jiawula Ag-Pb-Zn deposit lies in the renowned Ag-polymetallic metallogenic province of northern China. The origin of this structurally controlled ore body is linked to fluid migration and mineralization along cogenetic fault systems. Sulphur isotopic compositions suggest that the ore-forming aqueous solutions were derived mainly from deep magmatic fluids. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions indicate that these fluids were magmatic during early stages of ore formation and meteoric during late-stage mineralization. Lead isotopic compositions indicate that this metal was derived mainly from a mantle source, and to a lesser extent from a crustal source. Collectively, the isotopic data indicate that formation of the Jiawula Ag-Pb-Zn deposit was ultimately a reflection of late Yanshanian (140-120 Ma) volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal activity. The addition of meteoric water to these magmatic hydrothermal fluids created favourable conditions for mineralization. During ore formation, metallogenesis took place in a relatively open, non-equilibrium system under conditions of low δ34S σS and an intermediate oxidation state. Microthermometric study of fluid inclusions indicates homogenization temperatures of 180-260°C. Salinities, densities, pressure, and depth of ore-forming fluids ranged from 0.18 to 12.62 wt.% NaCl eqv., 0.637 to 0.976 g/cm3, 3.44 to 162.05 bar, and 0.5 to 1.5 km, respectively. Laser Raman studies of single-phase fluid inclusions show that the ore-forming fluids belong to the H2O-NaCl system. Analysis of bulk chemical compositions of fluid inclusions indicates that the ore-forming fluid can be classified as the Na+-Ca 2+- -Cl fluid type. All obtained geochemical data demonstrate that the ore-forming fluids of the Jiawula Ag-Pb-Zn deposit are medium- to low-temperature, medium- to low-pressure, medium- to low-salinity, and low-density fluids. Based on their compositions, they can be classified into two end-members: magmatic hydrothermal fluid and meteoric water. The key factors allowing for metal transport and precipitation during ore formation include the sourcing of magmatic fluids with high contents of metallogenic elements and the mixing of these hydrothermal fluids with meteoric waters resulting in the formation of a large Ag-Pb-Zn deposit. In terms of genetic type, the Jiawula deposit can be regarded as a volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal vein Pb-Zn-Ag ore deposit. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

        "abstract": "In communication networks, multiple disjoint communication paths are desirable for many applications. Such paths, however, may not exist in a network. In such a situation, paths with minimum link and/or node sharing may be considered. This paper addresses the following two related fundamental questions. First, in case of no solution of disjoint multiple paths for a given application instance, what are the criteria for finding the best solution in which paths share nodes and/or links? Second, if we know the criteria, how do we find the best solution? We propose a general framework for the answers to these two questions. This framework can be configured in a way that is suitable for a given application instance. We introduce the notion of link shareability and node shareability and consider the problem of finding minimum-cost multiple paths subject to minimum shareabilities (MCMPMS problem). We identify 65 different link/node shareability constraints, each leading to a specific version of the MCMPMS problem. In a previously published technical report, we prove that all the 65 versions are mutually inequivalent. In this paper, we show that all these versions can be solved using a unified algorithmic approach that consists of two algorithm schemes, each of which can be used to generate polynomial-time algorithms for a set of versions of MCMPMS. We also discuss some extensions where our modeling framework and algorithm schemes are applicable.",

        "abstract": "We propose an innovative agile crossbar switch architecture called contention-tolerant crossbar, denoted by CTC(N). Unlike the conventional crossbar and the crossbar with crosspoint buffers, which require complex hardware resolvers to grant one out of multiple output requests, CTC(N) can tolerate output contentions by a pipelining mechanism, with pipeline stages implemented as buffers in input ports. These buffers are used to decouple the scheduling task into N independent parts in such a way that N schedulers are located in N input ports, and they operate independently and in parallel. Without using arbiters and/or crosspoint buffers that require additional chip area, the CTC(N) switch is more scalable than existing crossbars. We analyze the throughput of CTC(N) switch, and find 63% throughput bottleneck. For achieving 100%, we consider two approaches: using internal speedup and using space multiplexing without internal speedup. We prove that 100% throughput can be achieved with internal speedup 2 or using two layers of CTC(N) fabric mathematically. Our simulation results validate our theoretical analysis.

A meta-analysis was carried out by RevMan5.1 software on the outcomes concerning safety and efficacy of the two groups.Fourteen studies matched the criteria including 1083 patients. Five were randomized controlled trials and nine were retrospective analysis. Compared with the ES group, the SABS group had a lower short-term mortality(RR=0.52, 95% CI:0.30-0.93, P<0.05), lower overall complications(RR=0.46, 95% CI:0.31-0.70, P<0.05), higher resection rate(RR=1.90, 95%CI:1.33-2.70, P<0.01), shorter operative time(MD=-59.77, 95%CI:-87.51--32.04, P<0.01), and shorter interval to first flatus(MD=-10.78, 95%CI:-16.67--4.90, P<0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in permanent stomy and hospital stay.The safety and efficacy of self-expending metallic stents as bridge to surgery for left-sided malignant colorectal obstruction is superior to emergency surgery.",

        "abstract": "In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 300- 400nm were modified by two-step dispersion polymerization using poly (styrene-co-divinylbenzene)-methyl methacrylate [P (St-co-DVB)-MMA] as shell. And core, carbon black (CB) nanoparticles with size ranging from 30-50nm and polymer shell poly (methacrylic acid) [PMAA] were prepared by grafting polymerization, too. Modified nanoparticles were characterized on structure, mean particle size and size distribution, morphology with FT-IR, TEM, and image analyzer. Furthermore, modified TiO2 as negatively charged electrophoretic particles and CB nanoparticles as cationically charged electrophoretic particles were homodispersed in tetrachloroethylene (TCE) to make the electrophoretic display suspension with Span-80 as dispersant and OLOA 1200 as charge control agent. The zeta potential and mobility of white (TiO 2) and black (CB) charged particles were measured to be -61.4 mV, 9.50×10-6 cm2/V s and 12.8 mV, 1.98×10-6 cm2/V s by using an electrophoresis test device, respectively. Final, the electric response behaviors of the electrophoretic display suspension were studied under electrostatic field. The black-and-white particles moved quickly and reversibly inside ITO electrodes while the electric field alternated. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.",

        "abstract": "To explore the prevalence, clinical features and prognosis of multiple primary neoplasms in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC).Data of colorectal cancer patients admitted to our hospital from June 1994 to June 2002 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into multiple-cancer group (MCG) and single- cancer group (SCG). Clinical features and prognosis were compared between two groups.The incidence of multiple cancers was 7.4 % (83/ 1125). Forty- seven patients had multiple colorectal cancers metachronous CRC(S) in 12 and synchronous CRC(S) in 35. Thirty- six patients 5 patients with synchronous cancers had malignant tumors outside colorectal tract,12 of whom were gastric carcinomas. No significant differences were found between MCG and SCG regarding gender, onset age, Dukes stage and differentiation of index CRC. Cancer family history (P=0.002) and colorectal adenoma (P=0.036) were significantly more common in MCG than those in SCG. The local recurrence or distant metastasis in MCG was significantly higher than that in SCG (P=0.047), though there was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Forty- one percent of index tumors were located in right colon in MCG, significantly higher than that in SCG (P=0.048). The secondary tumors were mainly adenoma cancerization in MCG.Cancer family history and colorectal adenoma seems to be at high risk for developing multiple cancers in CRC patients. Gastric cancer and colorectal adenoma cancerization were common secondary tumors of multiple primary neoplasms in patients with colorectal carcinoma.",

The optimal timing of HR for SCRLM is still controversial. This study aimed to determine whether simultaneous HR is similar to staged resection regarding the morbidity and mortality rates in patients with SCRLM.Four hundred and five consecutive patients with SCRLM were treated with either simultaneous (n = 129) or staged (n = 276) HR. The postoperative complications were analyzed retrospectively according to the documented records and hepatectomy databases at the Gastrointestinal Institute.Perioperative morbidity and mortality did not differ between simultaneous resections and staged resections for selected patients with SCRLM (morbidity, 47.3% versus 54.3%; mortality, 1.5% versus 2.0%, respectively; both p > 0.05). Simultaneous liver resections of three or more segments would not increase the rate of complications compared to staged resections (56.8% and 42.4%, respectively; p = 0.119). Meanwhile, patients with simultaneous resections experienced shorter duration of surgery and postoperative hospitalization time as well as less blood loss during surgery (all p < 0.05).Simultaneous resections of colorectal cancer primary lesions and hepatic metastases were safe and could serve as a primary option for selected SCRLM patients.",

        "abstract": "Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) are important for angiogenesis after stroke. We investigated the effects of BMMNCs on cognitive function, angiogenesis, and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathway in a rat model of vascular dementia. We transplanted BMMNCs into rats that had undergone permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (2VO) and observed their migration in vivo. On day 28, we assessed cognitive function with the Morris Water Maze test and examined vascular density and white matter damage within the corpus striatum by staining with fluorescein lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin or Luxol fast blue. We evaluated expression of VEGF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma 1 (Raf1), and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the ischemic hemisphere by Western blot analysis on day 7 after cell transplantation. Contribution of the VEGF–VEGFR2 signaling pathway was confirmed by using VEGFR2 inhibitor SU5416. BMMNCs penetrated the blood–brain barrier and reached the ischemic cortex and white matter or incorporated into vascular walls of 2VO rats. BMMNC-treated 2VO rats had better learning and memory, higher vascular density, and less white matter damage than did vehicle-treated rats. The beneficial effects of BMMNCs were abolished by pretreatment of rats with SU5416. Protein expression of VEGF and phosphorylated Raf1 and ERK1/2 was also significantly increased by BMMNC treatment, but this upregulation was reversed by SU5416. BMMNCs can enhance angiogenesis, reduce white matter damage, and promote cognitive recovery in 2VO rats. The angiogenic effect may result from upregulation of the VEGF–VEGFR2 signaling pathway.",

        "title": "Hybrid switching and p-routing for optical burst switching networks",
        "abstract": "One promising switching technology for wavelength-division multiplexing optical networks is optical burst switching (OBS). However, there are major deficiencies of OBS. (1) The delay offset between a control message and its corresponding data burst is based on the diameter of a network. This affects network efficiency, quality-of-service, and network scalability.( 2) OBS adopts one-way resource reservation scheme, which causes frequent burst collision and, thus, burst loss. We address the above two important issues in OBS. In particular, we study how to improve the performance of delay and loss in OBS. To reduce the end-to-end delay, we propose a hybrid switching scheme. The hybrid switching is a combination of lightpath switching and OBS switching. A virtual topology design algorithm based on simulated annealing to minimize the longest shortest path through the virtual topology is presented. To minimize burst collision and loss, we propose a new routing algorithm, namely, p-routing, for OBS network. The p-routing is based on the wavelength available probability. A path that has higher available probability is less likely to drop bursts due to collision. The probability-based p-routing can reduce the volatility, randomness, and uncertainty of one-way resource reservation. Our studies show that hybrid switching and p-routing are complementary and both can dramatically improve the performance of OBS networks.",

Seven randomized controlled trials with 1446 cases were included in this meta-analysis. Fixed effect model or random model was separately used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paraaortic lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer.Total complication rate in the D(2)/D(3) plus paraaortic lymphadenectomy group was significantly higher than that in the D(2)/D(3) group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.75, P=0.03), while surgery associated complication between the two groups was almost the same. Lymphorrhea and severe diarrhea was more common in the D(2)/D(3) plus paraaortic lymphadenectomy (RR 16.23 and 9.56, 95% CI 1.99-131.98 and 1.70-53.67, respectively). Anastomotic leak, pancreatic fistula, abdominal abscess, ileus, postoperative bleeding and wound infection were similar. There were no advantages in operating time, amount of blood transfusion, in-hospital stay, reoperation, recurrence and 5-year survival favoring the paraaortic lymphadenectomy group except intra-operative blood loss and rate of blood transfusion (WMD 202.95, 95% CI 116.80-289.10; RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.20-3.10).Paraaortic lymphadenectomy is associated with increased total complication without altering postoperative recurrence and survival.

It is fabricated with two identical few-mode fibers (FMFs) by a heating and pulling technique. The mode-dependent power transfer characteristic as a function of pulling length is investigated. For exploiting its application, we experimentally demonstrate both FMF-based transmissive and reflective star couplers consisting of multiple 3-dB mode insensitive power splitters, which perform broadcasting and routing signals in few-mode optical fiber networks such as mode-division multiplexing (MDM) local area networks using star topology. For experimental demonstration, optical on-off keying signals at 10  Gb/s carried on three spatial modes are successfully processed with open and clear eye diagrams. Measured bit error ratio results show reasonable power penalties. It is found that a reflective star coupler in MDM networks can reduce half of the total amount of required fibers comparing to that of a transmissive star coupler. This MIPS is more efficient, more reliable, more flexible, and more cost-effective for future expansion and application in few-mode optical fiber networks.",

        "abstract": "The magnetic properties of lithium ferrite nanocrystallites ranging from 9.1 to 860 nm have been studied. The specific saturation magnetization ��s of these nanocrystallites decrease lineally with the nanocrystallite size. The specific magnetization versus temperature curves �� (T) and M?ssbauer spectra of sample A (diameter D = 860 nm), sample B (D = 11.8 nm) and sample C (D = 9.1 nm) have been measured. It is found that the Curie temperatures of samples B and C are 50��C lower than that of sample A. From the ��(T) curve of sample C, it seems that sample C consists of two magnetic phases. These phenomena have been discussed with the superparamagnetism and the surface magnetism of sample C.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed for mission-critical applications face the fundamental challenge of meeting stringent spatiotemporal performance requirements using nodes with limited sensing capacity. Although advance network planning and dense node deployment may initially achieve the required performance, they often fail to adapt to the unpredictability of physical reality. This paper explores efficient use of mobile sensors to address the limitations of static WSNs in target detection. We propose a data fusion model that enables static and mobile sensors to effectively collaborate in target detection. An optimal sensor movement scheduling algorithm is developed to minimize the total moving distance of sensors while achieving a set of spatiotemporal performance requirements including high detection probability, low system false alarm rate and bounded detection delay. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive simulations based on real data traces collected by 23 sensor nodes.",

METHODS:survivin -31C/G genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP in 711 healthy controls and 702 CRC cases. RESULTS:The number of CRC patients carrying with CC genotype was much higher than that of controls (36.5 % vs 26.2%,2 =17.89,P<0.01). Compared to CC genotypes,CG,GG genotypes and G allele carriers had a significantly decreased risk of CRC,with the decrease being 0.61-fold (95% confidence interval=0.46-0.80,P<0.01),0.52-fold (95% confidence interval=0.38-0.71,P<0.01) and 0.58-fold (95% confidence interval=0.45-0.74,P<0.01),respectively. CONCLUSION:survivin gene -31C/G polymorphism is associated with sporadic CRC risk,the G variant genotype is the independent protective factors against sporadic CRC in southern Chinese population.",

But Lactobacillus populations and L-lactic acid concentration of control group tend to be higher than that of treatment group.

It was determined that the delay time increased when the combustor prefilling time increased. Due to the explosion, the interaction of the shock wave and the pressure wave in the combustor leads to an increase in pressure near the inlet wall surface, thereby impeding the gas feeding. The wavelet transformation was used to analyze the pressure time signal associated with the detonation wave, which was found to be better than the fast Fourier transform typically used. Moreover, the phenomenon of single–double–single wave transformation was observed, of which the underlying mechanism can be explained by an interactive-adjusting process. Also, the experiment captured the reinitiation phenomenon of detonations after a long period of time (around 300 ms) of extinction.",

        "abstract": "Dual component microencapsulated hydrophobic amine and microencapsulated isocyanate were designed and fabricated for self-healing anti-corrosion coating. In this system, novel hydrophobic polyaspartic acid ester (PAE) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) were microencapsulated respectively with melamine-formaldehyde (MF) as shell via in situ polymerization. To reduce the reaction activity between shell-forming MF prepolymer and PAE, another self-healing agent tung oil (TO) was dissolved in PAE and subsequently employed as core material. With field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and optical microscopy (OM), the resultant microencapsulated IPDI with diameter of 2⁻5 μm showed a spherical shape and smooth surface. More importantly, both the morphology and microstructure of microencapsulated PAE enhanced significantly after addition of TO. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) analysis confirmed the molecular structure of chemical structure of the microcapsules. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that both kinds of microcapsules exhibit excellent thermal resistance with the protection of MF shell. Furthermore, the self-healing epoxy coating system containing microencapsulated IPDI and microencapsulated PAE/TO was prepared and investigated. From the micrographs of true color confocal microscope (TCCM), the self-healing coating containing dual-component microcapsules showed excellent self-repairing performance compared to single microencapsulated IPDI system, and the optimal content of dual-component microcapsules in epoxy coating was 20 wt % approximately.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, especially in Western countries. Although chemotherapy is used as an adjuvant or as a palliative treatment, drug resistance poses a great challenge. This study intended to identify biomarkers as predictive factors for chemotherapy.By microarray analysis, we studied miRNAs expression profiles in CRC patient, comparing chemoresistant and chemosensitive groups. The miRNAs of interest were validated and the impact on clinical outcomes was assessed in a cohort of 295 patients. To search for potential targets of these miRNAs, tissue samples were subject to in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis. Colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were also used for in vitro experimentation, where cellular invasiveness and drug resistance were examined in miRNA-transfected cells.The expression level of miRNA-17-5p was found increased in chemoresistant patients. Significantly higher expression levels of miR-17-5p were found in CRC patients with distant metastases and higher clinical stages. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CRC patients with higher levels of miR-17-5p had reduced survival, especially in patients who had previously received chemotherapy. Overexpression of miR-17-5p promoted COLO205 cell invasiveness. We found that PTEN was a target of miR-17-5p in the colon cancer cells, and their context-specific interactions were responsible for multiple drug-resistance. Chemotherapy was found to increase the expression levels of miR-17-5p, which further repressed PTEN levels, contributing to the development of chemo-resistance.MiR-17-5p is a predictive factor for chemotherapy response and a prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC, which is due to its regulation of PTEN expression.",

        "abstract": "The Haoyaoerhudong gabbro is a mafic intrusion located in the Haoyaoerhudong gold deposit, which is a giant gold deposit (148 t Au) hosted in Proterozoic strata on the northern margin of the North China Craton. In this paper, we present integrated SHRIMP U–Pb, geochemical and Sr–Nd isotopic data from gabbro of the Haoyaoerhudong gold deposit to reveal the magmatic processes behind its origin. SHRIMP zircon U–Pb dating constrains the timing of crystallization of the Haoyaoerhudong gabbro to 278.8 ± 0.81 Ma. Whole-rock geochemical results indicate that the Haoyaoerhudong gabbro has calc-alkaline features with enrichments of large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) and light rare-earth elements (REE) as well as depletions of high-field strength elements (HFSE). The relatively high (87Sr/86Sr)i (0.7053 to 0.7078) and low eNd(t) (−4.6 to −15.1) values of the gabbro indicate the involvement of crustal materials. Low Ce/Pb ratios (1.35 to 7.38), together with nearly constant La/Sm and Th/Yb ratios and variable Ba/Th and Sr/Nd ratios, suggest that the ancient mantle was modified by slab dehydration fluids. Based on new geochemical data and regional geological investigations, we propose that both the Haoyaoerhudong gold deposit and the Haoyaoerhudong gabbro formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting.",

        "abstract": "By analyzing the data of the recent decade from national governments,the U.S.Geological Survey and relevant web sites,we can know that China has ranked the first place of the world in the capacity of molybdenum production and consumption,and become the country with abundance molybdenum resources.However,there are still some problems needed to be solved urgently in Chinese molybdenum industry,such as lax production leaded by masses of minor enterprises,irrational industrial structure,backward technology and serious waste etc,which tells us that there is a long way to become a powerful country of molybdenum resources.Now as the world has recovered from the shadow of financial crisis,the situation of the international molybdenum markets is getting better gradually.Our country should strengthen macro-control of molybdenum industry;regulate the production and operation of molybdenum.Meanwhile enterprises should strengthen cooperation,accelerate technological innovation,upgrade the equipments to improve the use efficiency of molybdenum resource and make full use of the favorable situation in the future to promote the healthy and sustainable development of Chinese molybdenum industry.",

        "abstract": "MKK4 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, NM-003010.2), which belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, possesses functions in tumorigenesis. We hypothesized the genetic variants in MKK4 gene may alter its functions and thus cancer risk. In current hospital-based case-control study of 706 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) and 723 sex-age-frequency- matched control subjects in a southern Chinese population, we genotyped two polymorphisms of MKK4 promoter (i.e., -1304T>G, rs3826392 and -1044A>T, rs3809728) and assessed their associations with the risk of sporadic CRC. Compared with -1304TT genotypes, -1304TG had a significantly decreased risk of CRC (adjusted odds ratios [OR] 5 0.56; 95% CI = 0.44-0.72; p = 3.53 × 10-6), the -1304GG carriers had a further decreased risk of CRC (OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.23-0.70; p = 1.32 3 1023), and there was a significant trend for an allele dose effect on risk of CRC (ptrend = 2.64 × 10-7). The decreased risk associated with -1304G variant genotypes (i.e., TG+GG) was more pronounced in the subjects older than 60 years (adjusted OR = 0.41; 95% CI 5 0.29-0.57; p 5 2.25 3 1027), in ever drinkers (adjusted OR 5 0.41; 95% CI = 0.28-0.59; p = 2.42 × 10-6). The age and alcohol drinking status interacted with 21304G variant genotypes on reducing cancer risk (p values for interaction were 0.015 and 0.043, respectively). Western blotting analysis showed that the levels of Mkk4 protein in sporadic CRC neoplastic tissues were significantly higher in the carriers of -1304G variant genotypes than that in those with -1304TT genotypes. However, no significant association was observed between 21044A>T polymorphism and risk of CRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of genetic variants in MKK4 and cancer susceptibility. Larger studies are needed to validate our findings. © 2009 UICC.",

        "title": "Scalable segment routing-a new paradigm for efficient service provider networking using carrier ethernet advances",
        "abstract": "Segment routing has recently been proposed in the IETF toward making IP/MPLS networks service oriented while simplifying network operations. Segment routing computes paths at the source node using node identifiers and adjacency identifiers conjoined together to create a source-routed path. We propose a scalable transport paradigm as an enabler toward implementing segment routing in provider networks. We propose omnipresent Ethernet, our modification of carrier Ethernet (which is based on source-routed, binary-routed labels embedded in an Ethernet frame), to implement segment routing. We identify some of the scalability issues of the segment routing proposal in the context of source-routing overhead. To absolve scalability issues of segment routing, two routing schemes that implement multidomain source-routing techniques are proposed. The hierarchical segment-routing (H-SR) scheme is proposed, which deploys a limited number of special nodes called swap nodes that are capable of label swapping to implement routing. The swap-node placement problem is formulated as an integer linear program to minimize the total routing distance within a network. Three heuristic techniques for swap-node selection based on centrality paradigms are presented. The H-SR scheme is further improved by a proposed multisegment-routing (M-SR) scheme that assumes all nodes in the network to be capable of label swapping. The H-SR and M-SR schemes are shown to significantly enhance the scalability of segment routing. A test-bed is built using carrier Ethernet hardware to support segment routing that validates the implementation of the proposed schemes. A simulation model to evaluate the schemes from a scalability perspective and their associated trade-offs is presented.",

        "title": "Providing Service Continuity in Clouds under Power Outage",
        "abstract": "In cloud computing, it is crucial to maintain service continuity, while power outage is one of the most common and serious threats. To improve the resilience of cloud against power outage, a service provider usually deploys emergency energy supply (e.g., UPSs and generators) in a data center. When a power outage at a data center happens, the cloud service provider needs to make the operation decision on which subset of VMs to keep running and which servers to host such VMs to minimize its loss (or maximize its profit) using the emergency energy supply while the selected VMs are running in the affected data center until they are finished, migrated to other data centers, or normal power supply of the affected data center has been restored. No prior research has theoretically studied such a cloud service continuity problem under power outage. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and investigate the cloud service continuity problem. Specifically, we consider that a profit is associated with maintaining the continuity of a service, denoted as service continuity profit. Based on that we first formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the total profit subject to energy constrains. After showing the hardness of the problem, we focus on the design of approximation algorithms for solving the problem, where we consider two practical cases. In the first one with sufficient number of servers for re-provisioning, we develop a constant approximation algorithm of which the worst-case performance approaches the optimal solution within a constant factor (  $approx 4:5-6:4$  ). In the second one, we consider the general case with limited number of servers, and we develop an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio of around 5.7–8. By combining these two algorithms together, we can achieve both good worst-case performance and average performance. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency in terms of maximizing the service continuity profit of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), characterized by simultaneous methylation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), has been reported to be associated with biological malignancy in many cancers. Whether CIMP is potentially predictive of clinical outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown.We investigated the methylation status of ten TSGs and CIMP in 115 samples of HCC and 48 samples of corresponding nonneoplastic liver tissues using a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.The methylation frequencies of the ten genes examined in HCC were 40.0% for p14 ( ARF ), 60.9% for p15 ( INK4b ), 70.4% for p16 ( INK4a ), 34.8% for p73, 70.4% for GSTP1, 64.3% for MGMT, 13.0% for hMLH1, 59.1% for RARbeta, 82.6% for SOCS-1, and 80.9% for OPCML. CIMP+ (with six or more methylated genes) was detected in 68 (59.1%) of 115 HCCs and none of 48 nonneoplastic liver tissues. On stratified univariate analysis, patients with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I HCC with CIMP+ had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.002) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.042) than those with CIMP-. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed CIMP+ as an independent prognostic factor for both OS [hazard ratio (HR), 12.266; P = 0.015] and RFS (HR, 2.275; P = 0.032) in TNM stage I patients.CIMP+ may specifically define a subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome in TNM stage I HCC. Examination of CIMP status may be useful for stratifying prognosis of patients with early-stage HCC and identifying patients who are at higher risk for recurrence.",

        "abstract": "In-network content caching has been a natural trend in emerging network architectures to handle the exponential growth of video traffic. However, due to the potentially wide attacking surfaces, caching video content in the increasingly untrusted networked environment inevitably raises new concerns on user privacy exposure and unauthorized video access. Existing encrypted protocols like HTTPs either fall short of fully leveraging in-network caching or require decrypting the traffic in the middle without guaranteeing the end-to-end security. In this paper, we present a new networked system for efficient encrypted video delivery while preserving the benefits of in-network caching. As video chunks are encrypted before distribution, we first design a compact, efficient, yet encrypted video fingerprint index to empower the network with a fully controlled capability of locating the cached encrypted chunks for given encrypted requests. We then explain how to deploy the encrypted design in our proposed architecture and present a secure redundancy elimination protocol to enable fast video delivery via leveraging cached encrypted chunks. We further discuss the full support of cache management, adaptive video delivery, and video access control. Rigorous analysis and prototype evaluations demonstrate the security, efficiency, and effectiveness of the design.",

(3) The methylation status of Syk gene was correlated with the lymph node status and the Dukes stage, but not with other clinicopathological parameters. (4) The follow-up data revealed that the 3-year survival of patients with Syk hypermethylation was lower than that of patients without Syk hypermethylation(73.5% vs.95.7%,P=0.007),and postoperative recurrence rate significantly increased in the Syk hypermethylation group (32.4% vs. 8.4%,P=0.02).Hypermethylation leads to silence of Syk gene involved in the initiation of colorectal cancer, which increases the infiltration of colorectal cancer cells, postoperative relapse and decreases the postoperative 3-year survival time.",

Local-mode frequencies and their distributions were computed using a molecular-mechanics force field based frequency map that was constructed on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations. The local-mode frequencies were found to be determined primarily by peptide backbone and side chain, rather by solvent, suggesting their local structural sensitivities. Intermode vibrational couplings computed using a transition dipole scheme were found to be very sensitive to peptide conformation, with their signs and magnitudes varying periodically along the peptide chain. Linear infrared absorption spectra of the three peptides, simulated using a frequency-frequency time-correlation function method, were found to be in fair agreement with experimental results. Normalized potential energy distribution analysis indicated that the amide-I mode can delocalize over a few amide units. However, the IR band structure appears to be more sophisticated in helical β-peptides than in helical α-peptides.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the combined effect of thermosonication (TS) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) against Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Chinese rice wine. The effectiveness of standalone TS treatment (35 °C, 750 W, 120 min) on the inactivation of S. cerevisiae was insignificant (0.76 log CFU/mL). However, 2.88 log CFU/mL of S. cerevisiae were inactivated when the standalone PEF treatment with moderate conditions (35 °C, 12 kV/cm, 120 μs) was applied. The combination of TS and PEF had an additive effect on the inactivation of S. cerevisiae, and the sequence applied (TS-PEF or PEF-TS) markedly influenced the inactivation results (P u003c 0.05). In particular, the microbial inactivation by TS-PEF (3.72 log CFU/mL) was higher than that by PEF-TS (3.48 log CFU/mL); this result indicates that PEF were able to restrain the effect of TS. On the other hand, TEM micrographs of S. cerevisiae after the different treatments showed that the combined techniques resulted in more severe disruptions on cells. Higher cytoplasmic shrinkage and more intracellular material leakage were observed from the TEM observations of the cells treated by TS-PEF. These results may serve as a reference of the potential application of the combined treatment TS-PEF for microbial inactivation in Chinese rice wine.",

The effect of NIPAm on the formation mechanism, surface morphologies, crystallization properties, and thermal stabilities of the MicroPCMs were studied using FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), and TGA (thermogravimetric analysis), respectively. The results indicate that addition of NIPAm causes a significant increase in the enthalpy of the heterogeneous nucleation (approximately 2–4 times more than without NIPAm). The diameter distribution of microcapsules becomes narrower (the PDI (polydispersity index) has a minimum of 0.073) and the encapsulation ratio and encapsulation efficiency increase. On the contrary, the microcapsules that have some irregular holes were obtained by adding NIPAm prepolymer.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic-magnetism meant that the alternately varied stress resulted in magnetic changes in rocks. Based on magnetic repulsion or magnetic gravitation relations between magnetic force and metallogenetic elements, quantitative change between stress and rock magnetization rate, stress and rock remnant magnetization intensity, the paper, taking the Jiapigou ore deposits concentrating area in Jilin as an instance, discussed the continental dynamic-magnetism having an influence on metallogenetic elements' enrichment. The main views were as follows. 1)Gold was easy enriched in place of the content of magnetite being high and strength of dynamic-magnetism being big. In case of iron ore or magnetite quartzite being folded, gold should be enriched in the hinge end or limbs of fold. 2)In non-magnetic medium plate, it was favorable for gold to concentrate in tectonic lens along direction of magnetic energy increasing in both the low and high pressure areas. The wall rocks showed an opposite tendency: gold contents in rocks inversed the rock's magnetic strength. 3)Dynamic-magnetism influenced metallogenetic elements' enrichment in diamagnetic medium in liquid, which manifested mostly in the corresponding relation of overall stress of diamagnetic object, displacement, remanence, moving track and differentiation-concentration of metallogenetic elements. 4) Frequency of continental dynamic-magnetism influenced metallogenetic elements' enrichment too, namely, frequency of continental collision in the same tectonic belt inversed dynamic-magnetic strength so as to concentrate not obviously, while frequency of multiple faults in different strikes was direct to that, which was favorable to elements' concentration. These results might further develop and deepen the study fields on continental dynamics and metallogenesis.",

In network-wide virtualization, it is important to efficiently map a virtual infrastructure (VI) over a wide-area optical network and guarantee the survivability of such a VI against failures. In this paper, we study the regional failure-resilient VI mapping (RRVIM) problem, where a failure-dependent protection approach is used to enable efficient sharing of protection resources among different regional failure scenarios. We first formulate the minimum-cost RRVIM problem using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and then propose four heuristic algorithms to solve the problem. The efficiency of the MILP and the heuristics is compared via extensive simulation experiments under various performance metrics.",

        "abstract": "Located in middle-southern section of the Da Hinggan Ling metallogenic belt,the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit is a typical skarn deposit.In order to determine the petrogenetic and metallogentic ages of the deposit,the authors emphatically studied zircon LA-ICP-MS and molybdenite Re-Os chronology of the granite.Combined with the precise chronological data,this paper discussses in detail the geodynamic setting of the deposit.Zircon LA-ICP-MS analysis of the granite shows that the crystallization age of the granite is 139.96±0.87 Ma,indicating that the granite related to mineralization resulted from magmatism in early Cretaceous period.The molybdenite Re-Os dating gives an isochron age of 134.9±5.2 Ma,which indicates that the metallogentic and petrogenetic ages are consistent with each other.Isotopic chronology demonstrates that both the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit and the associated granite are products of magmatic activities in the Yanshanian period.Combined with ore deposit geology and mineralization epoch as well as regional tectonic evolution,the authors have reached the conclusion that the formation of the Huanggangliang Fe-Sn deposit in the Da Hinggan Ling region occurred at the peak metallogenic stage of 140 Ma.The tectonic setting of the deposit was in the transition period from lithosphere compression to extension.",

        "abstract": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a critical role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), but little is known about the function of lncRNAs in the colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). This study was designed to identify specific lncRNAs correlating to liver metastasis of CRC, and to further assess their clinical value. Seventeen patients with primary CRC lesions, adjacent normal mucosa, and synchronous liver metastases lesions were divided into discovery set (six patients) and test set (11 patients). Transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) was used to screen differential expression of lncRNAs in the discovery set. Based on bioinformatics data, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the target lncRNA in test set. The relationships between target lncRNA and clinical values were analysed in an expanded validation set of additional 91 patients. 23 upregulated and 14 downregulated lncRNAs were detected for distinguishing synchronous liver metastases, primary CRC lesions from adjacent normal mucosa in the RNAseq set. The expression levels of four lncRNAs in the 37 lncRNA signature were verified by qRT-PCR in the test set. Compared with the paired normal mucosa, high expression levels of lnc-small-nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) were detected not only in primary CRC lesions but also in liver metastases lesions in the test set. Furthermore, in the expanded validation set, high expression of lnc-SNHG15 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis and liver metastasis (p < 0.05), and patients displaying high lncRNA-SNHG15 expression exhibited a shorter median overall survival duration than those displaying low expression (30.7 vs. 35.2 months; p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that lncRNA-SNHG15 overexpression may serve as a poor prognostic biomarker for CRC patients (p = 0.049; Cox's regression: 2.731). Lnc-SNHG15 overexpression was significantly associated with CLM and high-expression of lnc-SNHG15 in CRC was an independent predictor of poor survival.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effectiveness of different surface treatments that could promote the bond strength of composite resin to commercially pure titanium.The 24 casting pure titanium specimen were randomly divided into four groups: Smooth group, rough group, acid etching smooth group, acid etching rough group. Each group had six specimens. In the different groups, the specimens were treated respectively under different surface treatments. The specimens of rough group was sandblasted, the acid etching smooth group was treated by acid etching, the acid etching rough group was treated by acid etching after sandblasting, the smooth group had no treatment. After surface treatment, the casting pure titanium specimens that were veneered by composite resin became titanium-composite resin specimen. Then the bond strengths were evaluated by universal testing machine and the surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscope including titanium surface appearance and titanium surface appearance of different groups after shear test.The bond strengths of smooth group, rough group, acid etching smooth group, acid etching rough group were (3.08 +/- 0.45), (6.05 +/- 0.74), (6.27 +/- 0.80), (10.16 +/- 0.82) MPa, respectively. The statistical analysis showed that the bond strengths in rough group, acid etching smooth group, acid etching rough group were higher than in smooth group (P < 0.01). The highest bond strength was the acid etching rough group. There were no significant differences in the bond strength between rough group and acid etching smooth group (P > 0.05). There were some different titanium surface appearances in each group before and after testing.Titanium surface treatment of sandblasting and etching can improve the bond strength between titanium and composite resin. The pre-treatment of sandblasting before etching is an effective modification method of titanium for bonding to composite resin.",

The association of clinicopathological factors and local recurrence was analyzed using Log-rank test. Cox multiple variate analysis was conducted to determine the independent risk factors.All the 535 rectal carcinoma patients underwent radical resections. Local recurrence occurred in 53 cases (9.9%), and distant metastasis co-occurred in 39 cases (7.3%). The time from the first operation to the recurrence was 4-54 months with a median of 12 months. The Log-rank test showed that the primary tumor site (P<0.01), differentiation(P<0.01), histological type(P=0.038), lymph node metastasis(P=0.023), Dukes staging(P=0.045), blood transfusion(P=0.001), and total mesorectum excision (TME)(P<0.001) were associated with the recurrence, but the operative style(P=0.908), invasive depth of primary tumor(P=0.735), massive pathological type(P=0.562), degree of surgeon(P=0.171) and post-operative chemotherapy (P=0.772) were not associated with the recurrence. Cox multiple variate analysis revealed that blood transfusion, primary tumor site, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and TME principle were independent prognostic factors affecting local recurrence after radical resection of rectal cancer.Blood transfusion, low position of tumor, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis are the risk factors associated with local recurrence in rectal cancer. Application of TME principle is the key point to decrease the local recurrence rate.",

Using the O-H and S-H stretching modes as structural probes, EG and EDT were found to exhibit different conformational preferences, even though they share similar molecular formula. Results suggest that the gauche conformation of EG presents and is stabilized by the intramolecular hydrogen bond (IHB), while both the trans and gauche EDT are possible in the two solvents. Exchangeable IHB donor and acceptor pairs were predicted in the case of EG. Anharmonic vibrational frequencies, anharmonicities, and couplings of the O-H and S-H stretching modes were predicted and found to be structurally dependent. Linear IR and two-dimensional IR spectra containing these structural signatures were simulated and discussed. These results demonstrate that a combination of the methods used here is very useful in revealing structural dynamics of small molecules in condensed phases.",

        "abstract": "Since yield traits are complicated quantitative traits,QTLs mapping and genetic effects analyzing for seed yield and its components can help us to understand the source for heterosis and improve the selection efficiency for good genotype of seed yield.A genetic linkage map consisting of 244 DNA markers was constructed based on F_2 population derived from a cross between double low parent CMS maintainer 1141B and double high CMS restorer Ken C_1.The markers in the linkage map distributed on all the 20 main linkage groups and 1 triplet and covered 2 769.5 cM of the rapeseed genome.The statistic software of Windows QTL Cartographer Version2.0 and Composite Internal Mapping(CIM) were applied to detect QTLs for seed yield and its components,including seed yield per plant,number of silique per plant,number of seed per silique and 1000-seed weight.A total of 16 QTLs located in nine different linkage groups were identified for seed yield and the three component traits.There were three QTLs(the most QTLs) in LG6 and LG13,respectively.Each of these QTLs explained 0.38%73.34% of the phenotypic variance.They had additional effect of alleles that came from maternal parent,the others from paternal parent for the same trait.Epistatic effect was screened in all 20 linkage groups using all possible loci pairs by two-way ANOVAs between co-dominant markers.Twenty-six two-locus combinations had significant epistatic effects.The results showed that there were many interaction loci involving the entire genome detected in yield traits.The epistatic interactions had pleiotropic effects,interactions were contained epistasis between QTL and non-QTL(non-significant effect loci) and between non-QTL.The latter was the majority.In general,the independent effect of interaction loci was lower,on the opposite,the value of interaction effect was higher,and much higher than the total of independent effects.This indicated that the genes controlling seed yield was complicated.Epistasis interactions might play an important role as the basis of heterosis in Brassica napus L.Some questions about QTLs mapping were also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Combined computational and experimental techniques were employed to investigate at the microscopic level the structural and dynamic properties of ferro- and ferricyanide ions in aqueous solution. The characterization of the structural patterns and multiscale dynamics taking place within the first solvation spheres in water and heavy water solvents was first achieved through extensive molecular dynamics simulations, performed with refined force fields, specifically parametrized for the cyanide ions under investigation. The information gained about the solute-solvent interactions is then validated through the successful comparison of computed and measured waiting-time-dependent 2D IR spectra. The vibrational patterns resulting from 2D IR measurements were rationalized in terms of the interaction between the ion and the neighboring water molecules described by simulation. It was found that, within the first solvation sphere, the stronger interactions of the solvent with the ferro species are responsible for a delay in the relaxation dynamics, which becomes more and more evident on longer time scales.",

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate the association between clinical variables and overall survival time.A consecutive series of 1.294 CRC patients were enrolled for the final analyses. The five-year survival rates were 94.1%, 80.2%, 61.7% and 23.2% of patients with stage from I to IV CRC, respectively. One hundred and seven patients (8.3%) had disease recurrence during the follow-up with a median of 50.3 months. After radical surgical resections, patients with recurrence could still expect a five-year survival rate of 44.3%. Multivariate analysis showed that patient age >60 years, infiltrative tumor type, intestinal obstruction, poor tumor differentiation, disease recurrence and late TNM stage were associated with poor survival (all p<0.05).The overall postoperative survival in this series of patients with CRC was mainly affected by patient age, tumor morphology, bowel obstruction, histological grade, TNM stage and disease recurrence. For those patients with recurrence, surgical resection should be recommended primarily if the tumor is resectable.",

        "title": "Microcollinearity between autopolyploid sugarcane and diploid sorghum genomes.",
        "abstract": "Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) has become an increasingly important crop for its leading role in biofuel production. The high sugar content species S. officinarum is an octoploid without known diploid or tetraploid progenitors. Commercial sugarcane cultivars are hybrids between S. officinarum and wild species S. spontaneum with ploidy at approximately 12x. The complex autopolyploid sugarcane genome has not been characterized at the DNA sequence level.The microsynteny between sugarcane and sorghum was assessed by comparing 454 pyrosequences of 20 sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) with sorghum sequences. These 20 BACs were selected by hybridization of 1961 single copy sorghum overgo probes to the sugarcane BAC library with one sugarcane BAC corresponding to each of the 20 sorghum chromosome arms. The genic regions of the sugarcane BACs shared an average of 95.2% sequence identity with sorghum, and the sorghum genome was used as a template to order sequence contigs covering 78.2% of the 20 BAC sequences. About 53.1% of the sugarcane BAC sequences are aligned with sorghum sequence. The unaligned regions contain non-coding and repetitive sequences. Within the aligned sequences, 209 genes were annotated in sugarcane and 202 in sorghum. Seventeen genes appeared to be sugarcane-specific and all validated by sugarcane ESTs, while 12 appeared sorghum-specific but only one validated by sorghum ESTs. Twelve of the 17 sugarcane-specific genes have no match in the non-redundant protein database in GenBank, perhaps encoding proteins for sugarcane-specific processes. The sorghum orthologous regions appeared to have expanded relative to sugarcane, mostly by the increase of retrotransposons.The sugarcane and sorghum genomes are mostly collinear in the genic regions, and the sorghum genome can be used as a template for assembling much of the genic DNA of the autopolyploid sugarcane genome. The comparable gene density between sugarcane BACs and corresponding sorghum sequences defied the notion that polyploidy species might have faster pace of gene loss due to the redundancy of multiple alleles at each locus.",

        "abstract": "A molecular mechanics (MM) force field-based empirical electrostatic potential map (MM map) for amide-I vibrations is developed with the aim of seeking a quick and reasonable approach to computing local mode parameters and their distributions in solution phase. Using N-methylacetamide (NMA) as a model compound, the instantaneous amide-I normal-mode parameters (transition frequency and dipole) obtained at the level of MM force fields are converted to solution phase values by a four-site potential scheme, but without the need for quantum mechanical frequency computations of solute-solvent clusters as are required in constructing ab initio-based electrostatic potential or field maps. The linear IR line shape of the amide-I mode in NMA obtained from the frequency-time correlation function on the basis of the MM map are found to be comparable to those from the ab initio-based maps. Our results show that the amide-I local mode parameters are largely determined by the solvated peptide structure rather than by explicit solvent molecules, suggesting an inherent local structure sensitivity of the amide-I mode in solvated peptides. Applications to alanine di- and tripeptides are satisfactorily demonstrated, showing its usefulness as an alternative approach in providing vibrational parameters for the simulation of linear IR and 2D IR spectra of the amide-I modes in polypeptides.",

The microcapsules with different core-wall ratios were structurally characterized by Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser particle size analysis (LPSA) and so on. The results showed that PM was successfully encapsulated in PU microcapsules and the microcapsules had regular spherical shapes and clean surface. The surface of the microcapsules became wrinkled and some small pores appeared when the core wall ratio was increased to 5:2. The microcapsules could effectively protect PM against degradation below 45 °C and showed sustainable release for 40–80 hours in alcohol aqueous solution (50:50, v/v). From the fitting parameters of the power exponent, the release of PM from PU microcapsules was controlled by mixing mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The Wurinitu W-Mo deposit,located in Sunid Zuoqi area in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region,is a large W-Mo deposit discovered in recent years.The W-Mo orebodies mainly occurred in Yanshanian granite rock body and the nearby contact zone,with the major type of veinlet mineralization.Petrographic study of fluid inclusions suggests that the main types of fluid inclusions of Wurinitu metallogenic fluid system are two-phase vapor-liquid inclusions,vapor-rich phase inclusions,liquidrich phase inclusions and pure liquid phase inclusions.The homogenization temperature and salinity of the fluid inclusions vary in 130.0-371.7℃(the peak value vary in 160-260℃)and 0.2%-15.9% NaCl eqv(the peak value vary in 0.2%-12.5% NaCl eqv).The deposit belongs to a medium-low temperature,medium-low salinity W-Mo deposit.Laser Raman spectroscopic and inclusion groups components studies indicate that gas composition of the ore-forming fluid are mainly H2O and CO2,some N2 and O2,and less CO,CH4,C2H2,C2H4 and C2H6,liquid composition are mainly Ca2+,Na+,SO42-,Cl-,some K+,F-,Mg2+ and NO3-,and less Br-and Li+.The ore-forming fluids belong to the H2O-NaCl-CO2system.The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of fluid inclusions showed that the ore-forming fluids had lower values ofδ18 Owaterranging from-2.11% to-0.11%,and the value of δ Dwaterranged from-85% to-108%.The ore-forming fluids came from the mixing of magma water and meteoric water.Based on the geological and ore-forming fluids characteristics of the deposit,it is concluded that the Wurinitu quartz vein type W-Mo deposit is a Yanshanian magmatism-related and moderate-low temperature hydrothermal system.The ore-forming materials were mainly derived from the depth.",

The aim of the research is to study the influences of viscosity and thermal conductivity on the development and structure of detonation waves. Based on the Navier-Stokes (N-S) and Euler equations, two-step chemical reaction model is used in numerical simulations, 5-order MPWENO scheme is used for the solution of the flux terms and 3-order TVD Runge-Kutta method is used for time integration. For the viscosity terms, center difference scheme is used. Simulation results obtained show that viscosity and thermal conductivity have little influence on the basic structure of detonation flow-field. From the numerical values obtained, the influence values of viscosity and thermal conductivity are comparatively large at places where big changes of temperature or velocity happen, however, these values are all much smaller and can be neglected compared with that of detonation waves. Thus in one-dimensional and two-dimensional continuously rotating detonation waves, viscosity and thermal conductivity have little influence on the structure and values of detonation waves.",

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it is difficult to achieve a large data collection rate because sensors usually have limited energy and communication resources. Such an issue is becoming increasingly more challenging with the emerging of information-intensive applications that require high data collection rate. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the throughput capacity of WSNs, where multiple mobile relays are deployed to collect data from static sensors and forward them to a static sink. To facilitate the discussion, we propose a new mobile-relay-assisted data collection (MRADC) model. Based on this model, we analyze the achievable throughput capacity of large-scale WSNs using a constructive approach, which can achieve a certain throughput by choosing appropriate mobility parameters. Our analysis illustrates that, if the number of relays is less than a threshold, then the throughput capacity can be linearly increased with more relays. On the other hand, if the number is greater than the threshold, then the throughput capacity becomes a constant, and the capacity gain over a static WSN depends on two factors: 1) the transmission range and 2) the impact of interference. To verify our analysis, we conduct extensive simulation experiments, which validate the selection of mobility parameters and demonstrate the same throughput behaviors obtained by analysis. © 2012 IEEE.",

The fluoride nano-hydroxyapatite has good biocompatibility and has functional characteristics of remineralization on enamel. OBJECTIVE: To observe the closed effect of fluoride nano-hydroxyapatite on dentinal tubules. METHODS: Fifty-six healthy extracted teeth were randomly divided into four groups: fluoride nano-hydroxyapatite, nano-hydroxyapatite, sodium fluoride and blank control groups. Materials in each group were used to coat outer dentinal tubules twice on every morning and evening respectively (2 minutes/time), and then were saved in artificial saliva in a 37 ℃ thermostat. The teeth were longitudinal split as immediate group at 7 days after experiment. Teeth were longitudinal split again as wear group which using deionized water to simulate daily brushing 100 times on experimental area. Experimental area of dentin surface, blocking rate and closed depth of the section of dentinal tubules were observed using scanning electron microscope. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The dentinal tubules were open fully in the blank control group. Scanning electron microscope results showed that sealing effect of the dentinal tubules in the fluoride nano-hydroxyapatite group was better than that in the other three groups. Sealing effect of the dentinal tubules in the immediate and wear groups were fluoride nano-hydroxyapatite > nano-hydroxyapatite > sodium fluoride. It is indicated that blocking effect and sealing depth of the fluoride nano-hydroxyapatite are higher than those of the nano-hydroxyapatite and sodium fluoride.",

        "title": "A Study of Network Throughput Gain in Optical-Wireless (FiWi) Networks Subject to Peer-to-Peer Communications",
        "abstract": "Optical-Wireless (FiWi) access network is a newly emerged access network architecture which integrates passive optical networks (PONs) with wireless mesh networks (WMNs) to provide the ubiquitous, low cost, high bandwidth last mile Internet access. Though the PON subnetwork of FiWi network can provide high bandwidth, the interference in the wireless subnetwork still limits the throughput of FiWi network if all traffic goes online to the Internet. However, when peer-to-peer communication from one wireless client to another wireless client is introduced, the proposed integration of PONs and WMNs can significantly improve the network throughput. In traditional WMNs, peer-to-peer communication from one wireless client to another wireless client is carried in the wireless network, which is subject to interferences in wireless communications. In FiWi network, peer-to-peer communication can be carried through the wireless-optical-wireless mode in which the traffic is sent from the source wireless client to its nearest ONU, which is then sent to the ONU close to the destination wireless client through the PON subnetwork and then delivered to the destination wireless client. Such wireless-optical-wireless communication mode introduced by FiWi networks can sustain the interference in wireless subnetwork, thus improving the network throughput. This paper aims to study the network throughput gain in FiWi network subject to peer-to-peer communications and parameters which can affect the network throughput gain. We first have a fair modeling of FiWi networks and traditional WMNs. We then present an LP based routing algorithm for FiWi networks. Extensive simulations have been carried to study the network throughput gain in FiWi networks subject to peer-to-peer communications compared with traditional WMNs. The work provides insightful observations for fully utilizing advantages brought by the integration of PONs and WMNs in FiWi networks.",

We characterized the structure, surface morphology, particle size distribution, and thermal properties of prepared nanocapsules using methods such as the Fourier infrared spectrum, scanning electron microscopy analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of surfactant concentration and monomer/n-octadecane mass ratios on the average diameter and phase change properties of nanoencapsulated n-octadecane were investigated. The average diameter of nanocapsules is ∼300–500 nm. The surface is quite smooth and compact. An obvious core–shell structure can be observed from TEM images, and the thickness of the shell is ∼50 nm. When the n-octadecane/monomer mass ratio is 5:4, the encapsulation efficiency...",

The study shows that there are mainly two types of trajectories of these tracked particles. The particles in the outer region of the chamber present smooth paths and flow downstream quickly along the outer wall. The particles in the inner region, by contrast, show relatively winding paths before passing through the chamber. Overall, most of the flow particles are ejected almost along the axial direction. The physical properties of the flow particles change rapidly and evidently when they encounter the detonation front.

        "abstract": "In recent years, the increasing demand for media-rich content has driven many efforts to redesign the Internet architecture. As one of the main candidates, information-centric network (ICN) has attracted significant attention, where in-network cache is a key component in different ICN architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for optimal cache management in ICNs that jointly considers caching strategy and content routing. Specifically, our framework is based on software-defined networking (SDN) where a controller is responsible for determining the optimal caching strategy and content routing via linear network coding (LNC). For the proposed cache management framework, we first formulate an optimization problem to minimize the network bandwidth cost and cache cost by jointly considering caching strategy and content routing with LNC. We then develop an efficient network coding based cache management (NCCM) algorithm to obtain a near-optimal caching and routing solution for ICNs. We further derive the upper and lower bounds of the problem and conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance of the NCCM algorithm with these bounds. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the NCCM algorithm and the framework.",

The whole period was divided into two period based on the introduction of TME in Jan. 1999. The SP rates, leakage between the two period were compared.The SP rate increased significantly from 44.9 % in period I (Aug. 1994-Dec. 1998) to 76.2 % in period II (Jan. 1999-Nov. 2005)(P=0.000). The factors significantly influencing SP were the distance from the anorectal line, sex, period, circumference of intramural spread, histological differentiation (P< 0.05). Significant differences were detected between the two period in sex, volume of blood transfusion, Dukes' stage (P< 0.05). The rate of leakage were 2.7 % and 1.3 % in the two period (P > 0.05).Over 12 years, the SP rate of rectal cancers 1-5 cm from the anorectal line was significantly increased and volume of blood transfusion reduced obviously due to the introduction of TME. These surgical techniques, however, have no effect on the operating time and leakage rates.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a scalable multicast protection scheme based on a dual-homing architecture where each destination host is connected to two edge routers. Under such an architecture, there are two paths from the source of a multicast session to each destination host, which provides a certain level of protection for the data traffic from the source to the destination host. The protection level varies from 0 percent to 100 percent against a single link failure, depending on the number of shared links between these two paths. The major advantage of the proposed scheme lies in its scalability due to the fact that the protection is provided by constructing a dual-homing architecture at the access network while keeping the routing protocols in the core network unchanged. The selection of dual edge routers plays an important role in enhancing the protection level. Two problems arise for the proposed dual-homing partial multicast protection scheme. One is to calculate the survivability from the source to any pair of edge routers. The other is to assign a pair of edge routers for each destination host such that the total survivability is maximized for the multicast session subject to the port number constraint of each edge router. We propose an optimal algorithm to solve the first problem. We prove the decision version of the second problem is NP-complete and propose two heuristic algorithms to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms achieve performance close to the calculated lower bound.",

        "abstract": "Sex determination in papaya is controlled by a recently evolved XY chromosome pair, with two slightly different Y chromosomes controlling the development of males (Y) and hermaphrodites (Y(h)). To study the events of early sex chromosome evolution, we sequenced the hermaphrodite-specific region of the Y(h) chromosome (HSY) and its X counterpart, yielding an 8.1-megabase (Mb) HSY pseudomolecule, and a 3.5-Mb sequence for the corresponding X region. The HSY is larger than the X region, mostly due to retrotransposon insertions. The papaya HSY differs from the X region by two large-scale inversions, the first of which likely caused the recombination suppression between the X and Y(h) chromosomes, followed by numerous additional chromosomal rearrangements. Altogether, including the X and/or HSY regions, 124 transcription units were annotated, including 50 functional pairs present in both the X and HSY. Ten HSY genes had functional homologs elsewhere in the papaya autosomal regions, suggesting movement of genes onto the HSY, whereas the X region had none. Sequence divergence between 70 transcripts shared by the X and HSY revealed two evolutionary strata in the X chromosome, corresponding to the two inversions on the HSY, the older of which evolved about 7.0 million years ago. Gene content differences between the HSY and X are greatest in the older stratum, whereas the gene content and order of the collinear regions are identical. Our findings support theoretical models of early sex chromosome evolution.",

        "abstract": "Although abnormal expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (eIF6) has been found in several human solid tumors, the functions and underlying mechanisms of eIF6 in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) still needs further elucidation. In the present study, large-scale gene analysis based on Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed significantly higher baseline expression of eIF6 in colorectal cancer than in normal tissues. Furthermore, our Chinese cohort study revealed that high expression of eIF6 was correlated with aggressive characteristics and poor survival in CRC patients. Functional studies using magnetic nanoparticle extraction indicated that eIF6 was an oncogene in CRC cells. Regarding its mechanism, through Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis based on TCGA RNAseq database, we found that eIF6 can activate multiple AKT-related cancer signaling pathways, such as p-AKT\\MMP1\\cyclinD1\\Bcl2-related signaling, to regulate cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis in CRC. Collectively, these findings suggested that eIF6 can positively regulate AKT-related cancer signaling and enhance tumorigenicity in CRC, and may serve as a potential prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in CRC.",

        "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the impact of different feed additives on reproductive performance, egg quality, intestinal morphology, and blood metabolic profile of broiler breeder with different egg-laying rate. A total of 512 AA broiler breeders (48 wk old) were used in a 2 × 4 factorial design which encompassed 2 egg-laying rate levels [average (AR) and low (LR)] and 4 different dietary groups [control (no additive), 6 × 108 CFU/kg Enterococcus faecium (EF), 200 mg/kg apple pectic oligosaccharide (APO), and 1,000 mg/kg tributyrin (TRI)]. As expected, the LR breeders presented higher egg weight, eggshell thickness (P < 0.05), and feed conversion ratio as well as lower egg-laying and qualified egg rate than the AR breeders (P < 0.01). Dietary supplementation with the 3 additives improved egg weight (P ≤ 0.01). Dietary APO addition improved albumen height and Haugh units (P < 0.05) in both AR and LR breeders. Compared with APO and TRI, dietary EF addition increased eggshell thickness (P ≤ 0.01). An effect of the egg-laying rate and dietary additives on eggshell thickness (P < 0.01) was noted, with the addition of EF enhancing the eggshell thickness, which is more pronounced in the AR group. The duodenum of AR breeders presented a lower crypt depth and a higher villus/crypt ratio (P < 0.05); moreover, an effect of the laying rate and dietary additives on crypt depth was noted (P < 0.05), with the addition of APO to the diet resulting in a lower crypt depth. Compared with the APO and TRI, dietary EF addition increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in serum (P < 0.05). Overall, the results gathered in this study indicate that LR breeders have lower production performance, eggshell thickness and decreased gastrointestinal tract functionality in compared with the AR breeders. Dietary supplementation with APO might improve albumen quality and decrease duodenal morphology, while EF improved eggshell quality and FSH secretion, and the improvement was more pronounced in the breeders with an average egg-laying rate.",

However, the value of MACC1 as a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown.MACC1 mRNA expression in 128 HCC tissues was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To show the potential correlation of MACC1 and c-MET, c-MET was also analysed.MACC1 was more highly expressed in HCC than in non-HCC tissues (P = 0.009). High MACC1 expression was significantly increased in cases with high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (P = 0.025). A positive correlation was found between MACC1 and c-MET mRNAs (r = 0.235, P = 0.009). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that MACC1 expression was associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, stratified analysis showed that tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I patients with high MACC1 levels had shorter OS and DFS than those with low MACC1.MACC1 may identify low- and high-risk individuals with HCC and be a valuable indicator for stratifying the prognosis of TNM stage I patients. MACC1 may serve as a novel biomarker for HCC.",

Lymph node micrometastasis was further detected in 77 nodes from 14 patients. The detection rate of RT- PCR assay from the routine negative lymph nodes was 12.5% (77/617). Seven of those patients were up- staged (from IB stage to II stage, from IB stage to III A stage, from I stage to III A stage, from III A stage to III B stage, from III A stage to IV stage in one patient respectively, and from III B stage to IV stage in 2 patients).RT- PCR assay can increase the detection rate of lymph node metastasis and have a significant impact on the staging system of gastric carcinoma.",

However, the markers have not been applied for clinical decision making. We aimed to develop an immunohistochemistry signature using microarray data for predicting CRC prognosis.We evaluated 25 CRC gene signatures in independent microarray datasets with prognosis information and constructed a subnetwork using signatures with high concordance and repeatable prognostic values. Tumours were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of network-centric and the top overlapping molecules. Prognostic values were assessed in 682 patients from Shanghai, China (training cohort) and validated in 343 patients from Guangzhou, China (validation cohort). Median follow-up duration was 58 months. All p values are two-sided.Five signatures were selected to construct a subnetwork. The expression of GRB2, PTPN11, ITGB1 and POSTN in cancer cells, each significantly associated with disease-free survival, were selected to construct an immunohistochemistry signature. Patients were dichotomised into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with an optimal risk score (1.55). Compared with low-risk patients, high-risk patients had shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) in the training (HR=6.62; 95% CI 3.70 to 11.85) and validation cohorts (HR=3.53; 95% CI 2.13 to 5.84) in multivariate Cox analyses. The signature better predicted DSS than did tumour-node-metastasis staging in both cohorts. In those who received postoperative chemotherapy, high-risk score predicted shorter DSS in the training (HR=6.35; 95% CI 3.55 to 11.36) and validation cohorts (HR=5.56; 95% CI 2.25 to 13.71).Our immunohistochemistry signature may be clinically practical for personalised prediction of CRC prognosis.",

This algorithm actively selects outer constellation points which contribute to the large peak magnitudes, and dynamically alter the amplitudes of these points to reduce PAPR. It does not require transmitting any side information to the receiver and there is no loss in data rate. As radio-over-fiber (ROF) network is proved to be one of the best solutions for the wireless-access technology, this algorithm is verified in an OFDM-ROF system. It is shown that this algorithm significantly reduces the PAPR of OFDM signals. The performances of the system with and without the algorithm are also compared.",

        "title": "A Disturbance-Adaptive Design for VANET-Enabled Vehicle Platoon",
        "abstract": "In highway systems, grouping vehicles into platoons can improve road capacity and energy efficiency. With the advance of technologies, the performance of platoons can be further enhanced by vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In the past few years, many studies have been conducted on the dynamics of a VANET-enabled platoon under traffic disturbance, which is a common scenario on a highway. However, most of them do not consider the impact of platoon dynamics on the behaviors of VANETs. Moreover, most existing studies focus on how to maintain the stability of a platoon and do not address how to mitigate negative effects of traffic disturbance, such as uncomfortable passenger experience, increased fuel consumption, and increased exhaust emission. In this paper, we will investigate the dynamics of the VANET-enabled platoon from an integrated perspective. In particular, we first propose a novel disturbance-adaptive platoon (DA-Platoon) architecture, in which a platoon controller shall adapt to the disturbance scenario and shall consider both VANET and platoon dynamics requirements. Based on a specific realization of the DA-Platoon architecture, we then analyze the traffic dynamics inside a platoon and derive desired parameters, including intraplatoon spacing and platoon size, so as to satisfy VANET constraints under traffic disturbance. To mitigate the adverse effects of traffic disturbance, we also design a novel driving strategy for the leading vehicle of a platoon, with which we can determine the desired interplatoon spacing. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments, which not only validate our analysis but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed driving strategy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The traditional method of body classification is discrete, using crisp and rather dichotomous classification methods; there are many shortcomings for ergonomic design of clothing products by this method. This paper proposes a fuzzy method to classify lower body shapes based on triangular fuzzy numbers. By using factor analysis and correlation analysis, we found that the height, the waist girth, and the difference of hip-waist are crucial dimensions to represent lower body shape. We then classified the lower body shape into three categories according to the difference of hip-to-waist, and finally used the membership of triangular fuzzy numbers to represent the lower body shapes. Results show that the fuzzy method of body classification can more accurately represents body information than the traditional method without increasing the number of body types. Additionally, we established that the mean of the height, waist girth and hip girth of the young women of northeast China increased by about 0.8 cm, 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm respectively compared with ten years ago.   Relevance to industry : Anthropometric data is the basis of garment pattern design, and body classification is a necessary precondition for developing a garment size system. These research achievements will add value to the pattern design of young womenu0027s lower body clothing, the development of new sizing systems and related industries.",

        "abstract": "Introduction   VMP is a standard of care (SOC) for transplant ineligible NDMM. Daratumumab (D), a human IgGκ anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody with a direct on-tumor and multifaceted immunomodulatory mechanism of action significantly improves PFS and depth of response in combination with SOC in relapsed MM. Treatment-naive pts may benefit greatly with the addition of D to SOC regimens. Here we report the results from the ALCYONE study, where D is added to VMP in transplant ineligible NDMM.   Methods   Pts ≥65 years or otherwise ineligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation were randomized 1:1 to VMP ± D and stratified by International Staging System (ISS [I, II, III]), region (Europe vs other) and age ( 2  SC on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, 32 (Cycle 1) and Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 (Cycles 2-9); M: 9 mg/m 2  PO and P: 60 mg/m 2  PO on Days 1-4 (Cycles 1-9). In the D-VMP arm, D was given at 16 mg/kg IV QW for Cycle 1, Q3W for Cycles 2-9, and Q4W for Cycles 10+ (post VMP-treatment phase) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS. Key secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better, rate of complete response (CR) or better, minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity rate (10 -5  threshold, Adaptive clonoSEQ ®  Assay), overall survival (OS), and safety.   Results   Of 706 pts randomized (350 D-VMP; 356 VMP), median (range) age was 71 (40-93) years; 29.9% were ≥75 years; 46.3% were male. 74.9% of pts had ECOG scores ≥1, and 19.3%, 42.4%, and 38.4% were ISS stage I, II, and III, respectively. Of 616 pts evaluable for FISH/karyotyping cytogenetic analysis, 84.1% and 15.9% were standard and high risk (positive for del17p, t[14;16], t[4;14]), respectively. At the timepoint of the prespecified analysis after 231 PFS events on 12 June 2017, pts had received a median (range) of 12 (1-24) vs 9 (1-9) treatment cycles for D-VMP vs VMP, respectively. 80% of pts in the D-VMP arm completed 9 treatment cycles of VMP vs 62% of pts in the VMP arm. Median (range) cumulative bortezomib doses were 46.9 (1.3-55.3) mg/m 2  vs 42.2 (2.6-55.0) mg/m 2  for D-VMP vs VMP, respectively.  At a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the hazard ratio for PFS (D-VMP vs VMP) was 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.65,  P   Figure ). Median PFS was not reached vs 18.1 months for D-VMP vs VMP. The PFS treatment benefit of D-VMP vs VMP was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups, including age ≥75 years, ISS stage III, and high-risk cytogenetics. ORR (90.9% vs 73.9%), ≥VGPR (71.1% vs 49.7%), ≥CR (42.6% vs 24.4%) and MRD-negativity rate (22.3% vs 6.2%) were significantly higher for D-VMP vs VMP (all  P   Table ). OS data were immature after 93 deaths (45 vs 48 deaths for D-VMP vs VMP).  The most common (≥20%) all-grade treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE; D-VMP/VMP) were neutropenia (49.7%/52.5%), thrombocytopenia (48.8%/53.7%), anemia (28.0%/37.6%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (28.3%/34.2%), upper respiratory tract infection (26.3%/13.8%), diarrhea (23.7%/24.6%), pyrexia (23.1%/20.9%), and nausea (20.8%/21.5%). Most common (≥10%) grade 3/4 TEAEs (D-VMP/VMP) were neutropenia (39.9%/38.7%), thrombocytopenia (34.4%/37.6%), anemia (15.9%/19.8%), and pneumonia (11.3%/4.0%). Only 1 pt in each arm discontinued treatment due to pneumonia. The rates of grade 3/4 infections were 23.1% vs 14.7% and treatment discontinuations due to infections were 0.9% vs 1.4% for D-VMP vs VMP. D-associated infusion-related reactions (27.7%) mostly were grade 1/2 (grade 3/4, 4.3%/0.6%) and most (92.7%) occurred during the first infusion. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred in    Conclusion   The combination of D with VMP in transplant ineligible NDMM pts doubled the PFS (HR 0.50), which was driven by more pts achieving deep responses, including significantly higher ≥CR rate and tripling of the MRD-negativity rate. No new safety signals were observed when combining D with VMP. Three phase 3 studies have now demonstrated a consistent doubling of PFS and more than threefold increase in MRD-negativity rate when combining D with SOC regimens. These results support the use of a D-based combination, D-VMP, in transplant ineligible NDMM.

        "abstract": "Micro/nanobeads with different materials (magnetic, silica and polymer) and different sizes (diameters from 30nm to 970nm) were investigated for their use as amplifiers in a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor for more sensitive detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7. The micro/nanobeads were conjugated with anti-E. coli antibodies. E. coli O157:H7 cells were first captured by the first antibody immobilized on the electrode surface, and then micro/nanobeads labeled secondary antibodies attached to the cells, and finally the complexes of antibody-E. coli-antibody modified beads were formed. The results showed that antibody-labeled beads lead to signal amplification in both the change in frequency (ΔF) and the change in resistance (ΔR). Since the penetration depth of the oscillation-induced shear-waves for a ∼8MHz crystal is limited to 200nm, the interpretation of how the signal is amplified by the adsorbed particles was represented in terms of the coupled-oscillator theory. The amplification is not sensed in terms of increase in mass on the sensor surface. Amplification is sensed as a change in bacterial resonance frequency when the spheres adsorb to the bacteria. The change in the values of ΔF caused by different micro/nanobeads (amplifiers) attaching on target bacterial cells is indicative of the ratio between the resonance frequency of the absorbed bacterial-particle complex (ω(s)), and the resonance frequency of the crystal (ω).",

There is great potential in the applications of immunosensing technologies for rapid detection of pesticide residues in food and environment. This paper presents an overview of various transduction systems, such as electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric, and nanomechanics methods, which have been reported in the literature in the design and fabrication of immunosensors for pesticide detection. Various immobilization protocols used for formation of a biorecognition interface are also discussed. In addition, techniques of regeneration, signal amplification, miniaturization, and antibodies are evaluated for the development and applications of these immunosensors. It can be concluded that despite some limitations of the immunosensing technologies, these immuosensors for pesticide monitoring are becoming more and more relevant in environmental and food analysis.",

        "abstract": "The Langshan orogenic belt,located in the western part of northern margin of North China Platform,has experienced a long tectonic evolution and development process,which includes:①the formation of its crystalline basement in Neoarchean and deformation in Early Proterozoic;②the break-up,deposition and closure of its passive continental margin aulacogen in Mesoproterozoic;③the begining of its continental margin activities in late Neo-Proterozoic;④the development of compression and orogeny from Hercynian to Mesozoic with considerable intrusion of acid-intermediate magma.Abundant Zn,Pb,Cu,Fe,Au minerals occurred in the Langshan orogenic belt.The types,scales and the regulations of temporal and spatial distribution of these ore deposits show a close coupling relationship with ore-forming geological setting and tectonic evolution,and different deposits were formed in each stage of tectonic evolution in Langshan orogenic belt (as follows):①the hydrothermal sedimentary banded-iron formation (BIF) deposits were formed in submarine volcanic environment in Neoarchean;②the submarine exhalative-sedimentary lead-zinc-copper-iron sulfide deposits,related to the break-up process of the Langshan passive continental margin aulacogen,were formed in the Mesoproterozoic;③the middle-small sized porphyry copper-gold deposits were formed by the magmatic-hydrothermal activities,related to the process of compression and orogeny of Hercynian to Mesozoic.They were superimposed on the exhalative-sedimentary deposits of Mesoproterozoic and gave apparent modification to the latters.But parts of the Dongshengmiao, Tanyaokou and Hougoqi copper deposits were formed by the magmatic-hydrothermal process in the later orogeny.",

        "title": "Magmatic hydrothermal overprinting in the Mesoproterozoic Dongshengmiao deposit, Inner Mongolia: Geological and fluid inclusion evidences",
        "abstract": "The Dongshengmiao Pb-Zn deposit located in the Mesoproterozoic aulacogen in a passive continental margin in the northwest margin of the North-China Craton is widely considered to be a untypical SEDEX deposit. Recently, new types of mineralization such as chalcopyrite veins and re-crystallized sphalerite ores with visible hydrothermal alteration have been found in the deposit at depth. In this paper we report the decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in chalcopyrite, sphalerite and quartz from these new types of ores. The decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in chalcopyrite (4 samples), sphalerite (2 samples) and quartz (5 samples) are 303-456°C, 97-497°C, 146-350°C and 350-556°C, respectively. The decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in the vein-type chalcopyrite are similar to the decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in chalcopyrite from the Hercynian Oubulage porphyry Cu-Au deposit (313-514°C) and the Chehugou porphyry Cu-Mo deposit (277-485°C), supporting our interpretation that the Dongshengmiao deposit was overprinted by magmatic hydrothermal mineralization. The decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in re-crystallized sphalerite from the Dongshengmiao deposit are characterized by two peaks, 97-358°C and 358-497°C. The decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in quartz in chalcopyrite veins from the Dongshengmiao deposit are also characterized by two peaks, 146-350°C and 350-556°C. The lower and higher temperature peaks in both cases are considered to represent two separate mineralization events, original SEDEX mineralization and magmatic hydrothermal overprinting, respectively. The higher decrepitation temperatures of fluid inclusions in quartz and sphalerite from the Dongshengmiao deposit are similar to the decrepitation temperatures (340-526°C) of fluid inclusions in sphalerite from the Baiyinnuoer skarn-type Pb-Zn deposit in the region. Replacement of pyrite by sphalerite and overgrowth of chalcopyrite on pyrite in the Dongshengmiao support our interpretation that the original SEDEX mineralization was overprinted by magmatic hydrothermal activity in the deposit. Our results suggest that there may be separate porphyry and skarn-type deposits related to Hercynian magmatism and associated hydrothermal activities in the Langshan area, which are potential exploration targets in the future.",

Methods Lovo and Hela cells were cultured, passed, stored in liquid nitrogen, transfected with 10 μl recombinant adenovirus with Cp.CD.TK(RA-Cp.C.T), observed the green fluorescence. The total DNA of transfected Lovo and Hela were extracted and employed as PCR templates for amplifing Cp , CD and TK. The three interest genes were identified with agarose electrophoresis. The Lovo and Hela cell transfected with RA-Cp.C.T were overlayed on 96 well cell culture board, and every strain of cell was divided into two groups(24 wells per group). The first group was cultured with growth medium containing 10 mg/L 5-Fc, and the second group with growth medium containing 5 mg/L GCV. Cell morphologic observation with light microscope and cell vitality measure with trypan blue dying were carried out. Results All the Lovo and Hela cells, being transfected by RA-Cp.C.T,presented green fluorescence and had Cp, CD and TK DNA identified by PCR.

Root canal filling materials have detects, such as strong stimulation to tissues, difficulty in formation, bad root canal sealing and easy to be degradable. Objective: To study the effect of antimicrobial activity of nano-hydroxyapatite composite root canal filling materials with different pH values on common bacteria infected root canal in vitro. Methods: In vitro infected root canal model of enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans was established. The antibacterial property of nano-hydroxyapatite paste with different pH values in root canal in vitro was evaluated, including pH 8, pH 9 and pH 10. Zinc oxide eugenol were as a control. Results and Conclusion: All the root canal filling materials have bacteriostatic effect. Compared with the control group, the inhibiting effect of nano-hydroxyapatite paste in each pH value group on enterococcus faecalis was better than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference among nano-hydroxyapatite paste in each pH value group (P > 0.05). The inhibitory effect of nano-hydroxyapatite paste in each pH value group on candida albicans was not better than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Nano-hydroxya paste in each pH value group was compared, and pH 10 group > pH 9 group > pH 8 group (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that in the model of infected root canal, the inhibiting effect of nano hydroxyapatite paste on enterococcus faecalis was better than that of zinc oxide eugenol (P < 0.05), but the inhibiting effect of nano-hydroxyapatite paste on candida albicans was not better than that of zinc oxide eugenol (P < 0.05). Besides, nano-hydroxyapatite composite root canal filling materials with pH=10 have the best bacteriostatic property.",

Clustering is a key technical measure of UASNs, which balances the network energy and improves the network survival time obviously. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm based on 3D mesh, and design a hierarchical network model, a node addressing method for UANSs. The performance of the algorithm is compared with DS-VBF, IAR and GEDAR. The simulation demonstrates that our algorithm has advantages in terms of the end-to-end delay and the time-to-live (TTL).",

        "abstract": "SummaryThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary rapeseed meal (RSM) inclusion levels on growth performance, organ health and standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) in meat ducks from 15 to 35 days of age. Six hundred and eighty 15-days-old ducks were randomly allotted to five treatments based on body weight. Five isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated on a digestible amino acid basis by replacing 0% (the control), 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (based on fresh) of protein from soya bean meal (SBM) with protein from RSM. The corresponding levels of RSM in experimental diets were 0%, 6.66%, 13.32%, 19.98% and 26.64% respectively. With increasing dietary RSM levels, body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG) linearly decreased (p u003c 0.001), whereas feed-to-gain ratio (F: G) linearly increased (p = 0.0078). Ducks fed the diets with 13.32% or more RSM had significantly lower (p u003c 0.05) BW, ADG and ADFI, or higher F: G than ducks fed the control diet. The maximum limit of dietary RSM supplementation was estimated to range from 4.27% to maximize ADG for 15 to 35 days to 11.69% to maintain feed intake for 15 to 35 days on the basis of a broken-line model. At day35, the 4th primary wing feather length and SIAAD (except for Met, Thr and Val) linearly decreased (p u003c 0.001), and the thyroid glands weight (% of BW) linearly increased (p u003c 0.05) with increasing dietary RSM levels. Ducks fed the RSM inclusion diets had significantly lower (p u003c 0.0001) serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities than ducks fed the control diet. These results suggested that the maximum limit of dietary RSM containing 7.57 μmol/g glucosinolates was estimated to be 4.27% to avoid growth reduction.",

Differences in impedance of various quality of apples were measured by use of solartron 1294 impedance interface and solartron 1260 impedance analyzer instrument, four brass-wire probes electrodes, personal computer and the software of bioimpedance measurement of fruits. Apples as examples were experimented at frequency range (l Hz - 1M Hz), and the relation between their impedance parameters and their quality was studied. The results of experiment indicate that the increasing of the frequency could constantly lead to the decreasing of the impedance. When the frequency was increased from 1Hz to 1MHz, the two points impedance of apples' surface decreased 12-15 times. The impedance of good quality apples was nearly constant at both low and high frequency. When detected the rot apples, the impedance was similar to the good apples' at high frequency, and different at low frequency. It was 60-100 ohm lower than normal for the rot apple detection of various rot area. At 1 Hz frequency, the impedance measured of 10cm 2 rot area was 397ohm, which was about 200ohm lower than normal. The conclusion is it feasible that the bioimpedance can be adopted to distinguishing the internal quality of fruit.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, a series of reversible thermochromic microencapsulated phase change materials (TC-MPCMs), exhibiting excellent latent heat storage-release performance, were designed and fabricated successfully. The characterization and microstructure regulation of TC-MPCMs were conducted systematically as well. The core of TC-MPCMs was comprised of crystal violet lactone employed as thermochromic colorant, bisphenol A employed as developer and 1-tetradecanol employed as co-solvent, respectively. These influencing factors of encapsulation process such as the amount of emulsifier, stirring rate, feeding weight of core/shell ratio, acid resistance and thermal cyclic durability were carried out to clarify the effect of various experimental conditions. The surface morphology, shell thickness and core–shell structure of TC-MPCMs were characterized via optical microscope (OM), thermal field emission scanning electronic microscope (TFE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. From different scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the performance of temperature of fusion and crystallization and enthalpy of TC-MPCMs under various conditions were measured as well. The results of thermogravimetric (TG) analysis illustrated the influence on thermal stability of TC-MPCMs. In addition, Lab color space obtained by colorimeter is certainly intuitive to observe the colorimetric characteristics of TC-MPCMs as well. More importantly, the reversible thermochromic property associated with phase state of the 1-tetradecanol could also provide a visual evidence of energy storage or release performance of the TC-MPCMs. Furthermore, The TC-MPCMs exhibited excellent stability even after 100th thermal cycling test without any obvious performance degradation, including the morphology, phase change properties and thermal stability. In the end, the fire fighter protective clothing containing TC-MPCMs was designed and fabricated, which could provide adequate thermal protection in the various fire environments. Thus, TC-MPCMs developed in this work showed great potential applications in thermal protective clothing and other thermal regulation fields.",

Of all the patients, 56 cases were finally included in the study and were randomly allocated to two groups. Thirty patients were treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgery (RCS group), and 26 were treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (NCS group). The five-item version of the international index of erectile function (IIEF-5) questionnaire were used to determine erectile function before therapy and at least 12 months after surgery. The impacts of age, location, size of tumor, and body mass index on erectile function were analyzed.Total score was decreased significantly at follow-up compared to initial assessment in both RCS and NCS groups (23.4 ± 1.30 vs. 11.7 ± 5.8, t = 10.748, P < 0.01; 23.1 ± 1.3 vs. 15.2 ± 6.7, t = 5.910, P < 0.01, respectively). Score difference was statistically higher in RCS group compared with NCS group (11.7 ± 5.6 vs. 8.0 ± 6.0, t = 2.394, P = 0.020). In terms of tumor location for RCS group, difference was statistically higher in the patients with low rectal cancer compared with those with middle rectal cancer (14.5 ± 3.5 vs. 9.5 ± 6.0, t = 2.894, P = 0.008).The erectile functions of patients treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgery are more affected than that of patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in mid-low rectal cancer. Also low rectal cancer are significantly associated with erectile dysfunction in the patients treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgery.",

        "abstract": "A light-trail is a generalization of a lightpath such that multiple nodes can take part in communication along the path. A light-trail exhibits properties of dynamic provisioning, optical multicasting and sub-wavelength grooming and architecturally is analogous to a shared wavelength optical bus with an Out-Of-Band (OOB) control channel. The bus feature results in a node that has a large pass-through loss, and hence restricts the size of a light-trail to metro environments. Within a bus the OOB control channel allows for dynamic real-time arbitration. Due to this limitation, it is difficult to extend the light-trail concept to regional and core networks. In this paper we propose a method to provide multihop communication in light-trails thereby relaxing the limitation in hop count, as well as enhancing reach of communications. We propose node architecture and protocol requirements for creating Multi-hop Light-trails (MLTs). We then discuss design issues for MLTs in regional area networks through problem formulation. A simulations study validates MLTs.",

On this basis, the efficiency droop impact on the performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) visible-light communication (VLC) system was analyzed. The numerical results show that the VLC system performance decreases obviously under the impact of the LED efficiency droop. And, the performance deterioration of OFDM VLC system aggravates as FFT sampling rate increase due to signal dynamic range enlargement. Furthermore, the efficiency droop impact on the VLC performance can be alleviated by adjusting the LED operating condition. (© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH u0026 Co. KGaA, Weinheim)",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the deployments of wireless sensor networks in a class of mission-critical applications such as object detection and tracking. These applications often impose stringent Quality-of-Service requirements including high detection probability, low false alarm rate, and bounded detection delay. Although a dense all-static network may initially meet these Quality-of-Service requirements, it does not adapt to unpredictable dynamics in network conditions (e.g., coverage holes caused by death of nodes) or physical environments (e.g., changed spatial distribution of events). This paper exploits reactive mobility to improve the target detection performance of wireless sensor networks. In our approach, mobile sensors collaborate with static sensors and move reactively to achieve the required detection performance. Specifically, mobile sensors initially remain stationary and are directed to move toward a possible target only when a detection consensus is reached by a group of sensors. The accuracy of final detection result is then improved as the measurements of mobile sensors have higher Signal-to-Noise Ratios after the movement. We develop a sensor movement scheduling algorithm that achieves near-optimal system detection performance under a given detection delay bound. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by extensive simulations using the real data traces collected by 23 sensor nodes.",

However, traditional underwater acoustic sensor networks rely on the hardware infrastructure. The flexibility and scalability cannot be satisfied greatly. Due to the low performance of underwater acoustic sensor networks, it creates significant barriers to the implementation of big data. Software-defined network is regarded as a new infrastructure of next-generation network. It offers a novel solution for designing underwater acoustic sensor networks of high performance. In this article, a software-defined network–based solution is proposed to build the architecture of underwater acoustic sensor networks in big data. The design procedures of the data plane and control plane are described in detail. In the data plane, the works include the hardware design of OpenFlow-based virtual switch and the design of the physical layer based on software-defined radio. The hierarchical clustering technology and the node addressing techniques for designing media access control layer are well introduced. In the control plane, exploiting the hardware of the controller and designing the core module of controllers are presented as well. Through the study, it is supposed to maximize the capacity of underwater acoustic sensor networks, reduce the management complexity, and provide critical technical support for the high-performance underwater acoustic sensor networks.",

However, compared with 1997. the average unit price of exported textiles and garment reduced by over 60%. Besides weak innovation ability of the textile industry, low standardization level of the textile industry and irrational structure of standard system are also key factors leading to this situation. The article analyzes the existing technical standards for the textile and apparel sector at home and abroad, the development trend of technical standards and their effect on China's textile export.

        "abstract": "In mobile cloud computing, offloading resource-demanded applications from mobile devices to remote cloud servers can alleviate the resource scarcity of mobile devices. Recent studies show that exploiting the unused resources of the nearby mobile devices for task execution can reduce the energy consumption and communication latency. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to encourage mobile devices to share their resources or execute tasks for others. To address this issue, we construct an auction model to facilitate the resource trading between the owner of the tasks and the mobile devices participating in task execution. Specifically, the owners of the tasks act as bidders by submitting bids to compete for the resources available at mobile devices. We design a distributed auction mechanism to fairly allocate the tasks, and determine the trading prices of the resources. Moreover, an efficient payment evaluation process is proposed to prevent against the possible dishonest activity of the seller on the payment decision, through the collaboration of the buyers. We prove that the proposed auction mechanism can achieve certain desirable properties, such as computational efficiency, individual rationality, truthfulness guarantee of the bidders, and budget balance. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed auction mechanism.",

Over the last decade, a great deal of research work apply nanoparticles to improve the performance of QCM biosensors, such as applying them as solid support to immobilize the sensitive molecules and as label to enhance the frequency response. Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles could enhance the regeneration ability and shorten the detection time simultaneously.

In this paper, we will address the design of secure linear network coding. Specifically, we will investigate the network coding design that can both satisfy the weakly secure requirements and maximize the transmission data rate of multiple unicast streams between the same source and destination pair, which has not been addressed in the literature. In our study, we first prove that the secure unicast routing problem is equivalent to a constrained link-disjoint path problem. We then develop efficient algorithm that can find the optimal unicast topology in a polynomial amount of time. Based on the topology, we design deterministic linear network code that is weakly secure and can be constructed at the source node. And finally, we investigate the potential of random linear code for weakly secure unicast and prove the low bound of the probability that a random linear code is weakly secure.",

        "abstract": "Located in the western part of the Min-Li metallogenic belt within the West Qinling Mountains,the Zhaishang gold deposit is a large Carlin-type disseminated gold deposit discovered in recent years. The ore deposit occurs in the slightly metamorphosed Middle Devonian and Lower Permian clastic and carbonate strata composed of quartz sandstone,siltstone,calcareous slate and carbonate that comprise flyschoid formation. Gold mineralization is strictly controlled by a fault zone. Ore minerals are quite complex and consist of sulfides,sulfosalt,oxides,sulfate,carbonate,tungstate,telluride,native metals,and polymetallic intermetallic compounds. The diversity of mineral species in the ores and the existence of visible native gold minerals constitute outstanding features of the ore deposit.In the light of the REE distribution patterns,it is reasonably considered that the ore-forming materials of the ore deposit had affinity mainly with host rocks. S,C,Pb,H and O isotopic compositions show that the ore-forming materials were derived mainly from country rocks and underlying rocks and partly from deeper sources. Data obtained suggest that the ore-forming fluids were derived predominantly from an active meteoric groundwater system. The amount of the hydrothermal fluids in the ore-formaing and alteration system was relatively insignificant. Ore-forming temperatures are estimated to have been in the range of 120～240℃. The dissolution of ferruginous limestone in the host rocks and the sulfidation of the dissolved iron by H2S introduced by ore fluids constituted not only the most important depositional mechanism for the existence of visible gold grains but also the advantageous conditions for gold enrichment in the Zhaishang gold deposit.",

The luminescence characteristics of the different LEDs were measured experimentally and calculated theoretically. It is demonstrated that the efficiency droop of GaN-based LEDs is suppressed using the SRL due to the reduction of polarization electric field in quantum wells. This is beneficial to the mitigation of LED light output power-injection current (L-I) nonlinearity. Furthermore, using the different LEDs as light source, the performance of visible-light communication (VLC) system was also investigated. The results reveal that the VLC system performance is improved when the LEDs with SRL are applied. The reason is that the transmitted signal error decreases as the LED L-I nonlinearity mitigates. As a result, the GaN-based LEDs with SRL can be applied in the VLC to improve the system performance.",

        "abstract": "Lack of proper maintenance is the root cause of anywhere from a third to a half of downtime events in a cloud data center. To help safeguard the uptime of data centers, regular preventive maintenance must be conducted. During the maintenance time, some accommodated virtual machines (VMs) may be re-provisioned to the other available (backup) resource through migration, and some VMs may be terminated. One way that can allow a data center to perform all necessary preventive maintenance activities without causing too much disruption to VMs is to design an appropriate maintenance schedule. In this paper, given the available resource in a data center and the required maintenance activities with their deadlines, we consider the joint VM resource provisioning and maintenance scheduling problem to maximize the revenue of the data center. We tackle the problem by firstly proposing a heuristic for the resource provisioning under a given maintenance schedule. Using such a heuristic algorithm as the building block, we then propose another heuristic algorithm to solve the joint resource provisioning and maintenance scheduling problem and also derive its upper bound. Extensive simulations have shown that our proposed heuristic algorithms can effectively maximize the revenue of the data center.",

Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) plays an important role in autophagy, which is widely involved in human CRC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of the expression of ULK1 in human CRC. Expression of ULK1 in 339 CRC specimens (tumor-node-metastasis stages I-IV) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The optimal cutpoint of the expression of ULK1 was assessed by the X-tile program, and the patients were divided into 2 groups of high or low expression levels of ULK1, accordingly. Correlation analysis between the expression of ULK1 and the clinicopathological variables in CRC demonstrated that the expression of ULK1 was significantly associated with gender and tumor differentiation. Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that high expression levels of ULK1 were a risk factor for overall and disease-free survival. Therefore, the high expression levels of ULK1 may be a useful independent biomarker for predicting a poor prognosis in patients with CRC.",
