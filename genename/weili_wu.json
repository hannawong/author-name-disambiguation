        "abstract": "AIM To analyze the relationship between adult attachment styles of social anxiety disorder \ue5f0SAD\ue5f1 and its personality characters\ue584 so as to provide basis for further understanding of pathogenesy of SAD. METHODS A total of 82 subjects including inpatients and outpatients with SAD in the Phychological Health Center of West China Hospital of Sichuan University\ue584 middle school students and college students who were positive in SAD investigation of Chengdu from June 2004 to March 2005 were taken as SAD group. Meanwhile\ue584 82 normal people including students and teachers of middle school and college as well as residents of Chengdu were taken as normal control group. Adult attachment scale \ue5f0AAS\ue5f1 and qingnian zhongguo personality scale \ue5f0QZPS\ue5f1 were adopted for measurement. RESULTS Totally 164 subjects entered the final analysis. Scores in exotrophy\ue584 talent and interpersonal relationship of SAD group were obviously lower than those in the normal control group. Score in kindness factor of SAD group was remarkbly lower than that in the normal control group. There were no statistical differences in behavioral style between two groups\ue584 while behaviors of SAD group in factor of rigorous were obviously unrealistic and lacked cooperation. Subjects in the SAD group were easier to be irritated\ue584 impulse\ue584 lose temper and hard to control mood. They were more depressive in emotional expression and apt to conceal. There were statistical significances in attitude. Score of self-confidence in SAD group was markedly lower than that in the normal control group\ue584 and there were no statistical significances in attitude towards success and pursuit of success. Results of analysis of variance \ue5f0ANOVA\ue5f1 and Scheffe multiple comparison suggested that adult attachment of fearful style was the most dangerous factor for SAD. CONCLUSION \u2460There are distinct differences in personality characteristics between patients with SAD and normal people.\u2461There is a consistent tendency of SAD in personality characteristics of patients\ue584 while there are some differences in personality characteristics among different adult attachment styles.",

This paper mainly reports on its use in our mental health center and on an evaluation of its internal consistency reliability, discriminatory validity and construct-related validity.The patients group (n=89) and the normal group (n=110) were studied with the use of AAS.Cronbach's alpha coefficients in normal group are higher than 0.7. The discriminatory validity in anxiety and close-dependence dimension is good. The score of construct-related validity is high.The results are consistent with the theoretic construct that AAS divides adult attachment into three factors. But this scale still needs revision of its one or two items on account of cultural difference. The application of AAS will accelerate the research into the relationship between adult attachment style and adult marriage, consanguinity.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the prevalence and risk factors of social anxiety disorder (SAD) in high schools and universities in Chengdu. Methods 2279 students in Chengdu sampled by optimum distributing delaminating grouping method were interviewed one-to-one by the trained psychiatrists according to SCID. Both the cooperated SAD patients (n = 156) and the normal counterparts (NC, n = 156) in the 2279 students completed Egma Minnen av Bardndosnauppforstran (EMBU), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Form Y), Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE) and Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ). Results There were 179 SAD patients, 88 female ones and 91 male ones, in the 2279 students of the high schools and universities in Chengdu. Statistical analysis reveals that the SAD patients differ from the NC in seven aspects, i. e. growing circumstances (P = 0.049), family economical status (P = 0.000), family history of psychiatric disorder, scales of EMBU, STAI, FNE and DSQ. Conclusion The total prevalence of SAD in the students of high schools and universities in Chengdu was 8.15%, the female prevalence 8.35%, and the male prevalence 7.62%. The possible risk factors were: growing up in the countryside, low family economic state, parental rearing pattern being deficient in emotional warmth, understanding, trust and encouragement but excessive in refuse, denial and overprotection, having anxiety trait, feeling fear of negative evaluation, more likely to use neurotic and immature defense mechanism while less likely to use mature defense mechanism, having positive family mental disorder history.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Etiological researches find that genetics, intrinsic biochemical changes, some locations in the cerebrum, cerebral electrophysiology and psychological mechanism may have effects on the origin of the panic disorder. Based on the situation that no absolute and definite conclusion has been set up for the etiology of panic disorder, we summarized the researches about the pathopsychology, path physiology and neural anatomy of panic disorder. DATA SOURCES: A computer-based online search of Medline database was undertaken to identify articles about the etiology of panic disorder published in English from January 2000 to December 2004 by using the keywords of \"panic disorder, etiology\". Meanwhile, Chinese articles about the etiology of panic disorder published between January 2000 and August 2004 were searched in Wanfang database, the keywords were \"panic disorder\"in Chinese. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusive criteria: \u2460 Researches of randomized blind control design, before and after control design, perspective and retrospective studies. \u2461Researches of pathopsychology, pathophysiology and neural anatomy of panic disorder. Exclusive criteria: the repetitive researches, summarizations and the individual reports. DATA EXTRACTION: Totally 56 articles related to the etiological research of panic disorder of randomized blind control design, before and after control design, perspective and retrospective studies were collected, and 24 of which accorded with the inclusive criteria. Of the 32 excluded ones, 14 were repetitive researches, 8 were therapy researches and 10 were concerning with the genetics. DATA SYNTHESIS: \u2460Pathopsychological mechanism: Psychoanalysis theory believes that past traumatic experience in growth puts the patient in a persisting status of depression and anger, which leads to the latter panic attacks. Attachment theory believes that panic disorder originates from pathological decreasing threshold of releasing anxiety. The personality characteristics of patients with panic disorder are high scores of psychoticism and extraversion-introversion in Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. \u2461 Pathophysiological mechanism: thE abnormalities of respiratory physiological function of panic disorder found by clinical and laboratory researches reveals that the abnormal respiratory controlling mechanism may be a reason of this disease. The biochemical mechanism of the anxiety disorder contains the hypothesis of neurotransmitter and the hypothesis of neuroendocrine dysfunction. The abnormality of the \u03b3-propalanine in the brain may be the pathophysiological basis of anxiety reaction. \u2462 Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal that there are abnormalities in the construction and function of the brain, mainly locating in the temporal lobe. Since the volume of the bilateral temporal lobes in patients with panic disorder is smaller, the dysfunction of hippocampus may be a reason. CONCLUSION: Panic disorder is a multifactor disease related to the psychological mechanism, intrinsic biochemical changes including variations of the lactic acid, neurotransmitters and receptors, dysfunction of some locations in the cerebrum such as the brain stem, marginal area, and other relevant factors. The effective prevention and treatment may base on the possible pathopsychology and pathophysiology of this disease.",

It is found that correlation coefficient between GIC and magnetic field component variation may be greater than that of time derivative of the geomagnetic field,which are all less than 0. 5. By fitting maximum amplitude of GIC and the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field variation rate during 8 storms can be deduced the relation between them.

        "abstract": "In 2007, a novel bunyavirus was found in Henan Province, China and named fever, thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia syndrome virus (FTLSV); since then, FTLSV has been found in ticks and animals in many Chinese provinces. Human-to-human transmission has been documented, indicating that FTLSV should be considered a potential public health threat. Determining the historical spread of FTLSV could help curtail its spread and prevent future movement of this virus.To examine the pattern of FTLSV evolution and the origin of outbreak strains, as well to examine the rate of evolution, the genome of 12 FTLSV strains were sequenced and a phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of all available FTLSV sequences in China were performed. Analysis based on the FTLSV L segment suggests that the virus likely originated somewhere in Huaiyangshan circa 1790 (95% highest probability density interval: 1756-1817) and began spreading around 1806 (95% highest probability density interval: 1773-1834). Analysis also indicates that when FTLSV arrived in Jiangsu province from Huaiyangshan, Jiangsu Province became another source for the spread of the disease. Bayesian factor test analysis identified three major transmission routes: Huaiyangshan to Jiangsu, Jiangsu to Liaoning, and Jiangsu to Shandong. The speed of FTLSV movement has increased in recent decades, likely facilitated by modern human activity and ecosystem changes. In addition, evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found in FTLSV; purifying selection appears to have been the dominant force in the evolution of this virus.Results presented in the manuscript suggest that the Huaiyangshan area is likely be the origin of FTLSV in China and identified probable viral migration routes. These results provide new insights into the origin and spread of FTLSV in China, and provide a foundation for future virological surveillance and control.",

Dilution mimic DNA panels were used to assess the sensitivity of this technique. The RTDB-PCR method was performed and compared with three other methods: PCR sequencing, mutant-enriched PCR sequencing and mutant-enriched PCR-MassArray. A total of 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) specimens were also tested by all four methods.The RTDB-PCR was sensitive to as little as 0.01% mutant DNA, significantly higher than other methods. Among the 100 FFPE mCRC specimens examined, 45 tested positive for KRAS codon 12 mutations according to RTDB-PCR, 44 tested positive according to mutant-enriched PCR sequencing and mutant-enriched PCR-MassArray, and only 26 samples tested positive according to PCR sequencing.Compared with mutant-enriched PCR sequencing and mutant-enriched PCR-MassArray, RTDB-PCR is more cost effective, saves time, and is easier to use, making it suitable for the detection of low-level KRAS mutations in the clinic.",

Therefore, it is important to obtain reliable epidemiological data on the spread of this new infectious agent, a need that may be best met by the development of novel molecular methods. Here, a new method was described for the detection of avian influenza A/H7N9 using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Using serial dilutions of avian influenza A H7N9 cultures, the detection limit of the assay was determined to be approximately 3.2\u00d710(-4) HAUs (hemagglutination units) for the H7 gene and 6.4\u00d710(-4) HAUs for N9 gene. In tests of serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed avian influenza A H7 and N9 gene RNA, positive results were obtained for target RNA containing at least three copies of the H7 gene and six copies of the N9 gene. Thirteen throat swabs from H7N9 patients were tested; all tested positive in the assay. Specificity was evaluated by testing 18 other subtypes of influenza viruses; all tested negative. A total of 180 throat swabs from patients infected with influenza virus, including 60 from patients infected with seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus, 60 from patients infected with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus, 30 from patients infected with seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus and 30 from patients infected with influenza B virus, were also tested; all tested negative.",

In this study, a novel PCR-Mass assay combining multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was developed and used for simultaneous detection of eight distinct human enteric viruses. Enteric viral isolates and standard viral RNAs were examined to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-Mass assay. Clinical performance was evaluated with a total of 101 clinical specimens from patients suspected of having hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The results were compared to those of previous analyses using real-time RT-PCR. The identification of specific viruses and clinical specimens shows that the PCR-Mass assay performed as well as or better than standard methods with respect to indicating the presence of multiplex pathogens in a single specimen.",

        "abstract": "Since 2007, many cases of fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS) have emerged in Henan Province, China. Patient reports of tick bites suggested that infection could contribute to FTLS. Many tick-transmitted microbial pathogens were tested for by PCR/RT-PCR and/or indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). However, only 8% (24/285) of samples collected from 2007 to 2010 tested positive for human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), suggesting that other pathogens could be involved. Here, we used an unbiased metagenomic approach to screen and survey for microbes possibly associated with FTLS. BLASTx analysis of deduced protein sequences revealed that a novel bunyavirus (36% identity to Tehran virus, accession: HQ412604) was present only in sera from FTLS patients. A phylogenetic analysis further showed that, although closely related to Uukuniemi virus of the Phlebovirus genus, this virus was distinct. The candidate virus was examined for association with FTLS among samples collected from Henan province during 2007-2010. RT-PCR, viral cultures, and a seroepidemiologic survey were undertaken. RT-PCR results showed that 223 of 285 (78.24%) acute-phase serum samples contained viral RNA. Of 95 patients for whom paired acute and convalescent sera were available, 73 had serologic evidence of infection, with 52 seroconversions and 21 exhibiting a 4-fold increase in antibody titer to the virus. The new virus was isolated from patient acute-phase serum samples and named Henan Fever Virus (HNF virus). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the virus was a novel bunyavirus with genetic similarity to known bunyaviruses, and was most closely related to the Uukuniemi virus (34%, 24%, and 29% of maximum identity, respectively, for segment L, M, S at maximum query coverage). After the release of the GenBank sequences of SFTSV, we found that they were nearly identical (>99% identity). These results show that the novel bunyavirus (HNF virus) is strongly correlated with FTLS.",

This study describes a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR method for the detection of influenza A subtype H5 and for monitoring virus loads. Using serial dilutions of influenza A H5N1 cultures, this assay reproducibly determined the lowest detection limit to be approximately 5 x 10(-2) 50 % egg infective doses (EID(50)). In contrast, the minimum detection limit was approximately 3 EID(50) in conventional RT-PCR with WHO primers and 10 EID(50) in antigen-capture ELISA. In tests of serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed influenza A H5 gene RNA, there was linear amplification from 40 copies to 4 x 10(8) copies of target RNA per reaction and approximately six copies, and sometimes even as few as three copies, of target RNA tested positive in our assay. Thirty-five throat swabs from ill birds were tested: 33 samples tested positive using this assay. In comparison, 27, 13 and 19 samples tested positive using conventional RT-PCR, antigen-capture ELISA and virus isolation, respectively. To evaluate further the sensitivity of this real-time RT-PCR, a standard panel and 60 H5N1 isolates that contained different clades of influenza virus A/H5N1 were tested and all tested positive. To evaluate the specificity of the assay, 60 throat swabs from patients infected with influenza virus A H1 were tested; all were negative. Thirteen other viruses were also tested and all tested negative.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral blood-based gene expression patterns have been investigated as biomarkers to monitor the immune system and rule out rejection after heart transplantation. Recent advances in the high-throughput deep sequencing (HTS) technologies provide new leads in transcriptome analysis.By performing Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) profiling, we analyzed gene expression profiles of PBMCs from 6 quiescent (grade 0) and 6 rejection (grade 2R&3R) heart transplant recipients at more than 6 months after transplantation. Subsequently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out in an independent validation cohort of 47 individuals from three rejection groups (ISHLT, grade 0,1R, 2R&3R).Through DGE sequencing and qPCR validation, 10 genes were identified as informative genes for detection of cardiac transplant rejection. A further clustering analysis showed that the 10 genes were not only effective for distinguishing patients with acute cardiac allograft rejection, but also informative for discriminating patients with renal allograft rejection based on both blood and biopsy samples. Moreover, PPI network analysis revealed that the 10 genes were connected to each other within a short interaction distance.We proposed a 10-gene signature for heart transplant patients at high-risk of developing severe rejection, which was found to be effective as well in other organ transplant. Moreover, we supposed that these genes function systematically as biomarkers in long-time allograft rejection. Further validation in broad transplant population would be required before the non-invasive biomarkers can be generally utilized to predict the risk of transplant rejection.",

        "abstract": "A novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus was isolated in Mexico and the US in March and April 2009. This novel virus spread to many countries and regions in a few months, and WHO raised the level of pandemic alert from phase 5 to phase 6 on June 11, 2009. The accurate identification of H1N1 virus and other human seasonal influenza A viruses is very important for further treatment and control of their infections. In this study, we developed an oligonucleotide microarray to subtype human H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 influenza viruses, which could distinguish the novel H1N1 from human seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses and swine H1N1 influenza viruses. The microarray utilizes a panel of primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (MP) genes of human influenza A viruses. The 59-mer oligonucleotides were designed to distinguish different subtypes of human influenza A viruses. With this microarray, we accurately identified and correctly subtyped the reference virus strains. Moreover, we confirmed 4 out of 39 clinical throat swab specimens from suspected cases of novel H1N1.",

Genome sequence analysis indicated a close genetic relationship between MRV-HLJ/2007 and strain SC-A, which was isolated from swine in 2006 in Sichuan, China. Although phylogenetic analysis indicated that MRV-HLJ/2007 may have originated from the SC-A strain, the M2 and S3 genes differ between these strains. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that, except for differences in the S1 gene, MRV-HLJ/2007 and SC-A are closely related to a reovirus that infects humans. These findings suggest that MRV-HLJ/2007 might be a novel reovirus strain circulating in China.",

        "abstract": "PCR is a powerful platform for clinical and diagnostic applications, but challenges remain in detecting somatic mutations, as mutant cells are often mixed with more numerous wild-type cells at the tissue-sample sites. Here, we describe a novel method that couples PCR with restriction endonuclease digestion (designated real-time digestion-PCR, or RTD-PCR) in a one-step reaction tube for detecting somatic mutations from a minority of cells. The PCR mixture contains a thermostable restriction enzyme that digests wild-type alleles during the PCR program, allowing selective amplification of the mutant alleles. To validate this method, we used real-time digestion-PCR for the specific detection of the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) treatment resistance-inducing mutation, T790M, combining with three different platforms: Sanger sequencing, TaqMan probe PCR and Sequenom MassArray. From 78 clinical samples, seven T790M mutations were consistently detected on all three platforms, indicating that RTD-PCR may be a useful clinical tool for analyzing the T790M point mutation.",

        "abstract": "To investigate molecular epidemiology of dengue viruses (DENV) in southern China, a total of 14 dengue isolates were collected in southern China during each epidemic year between 1978 and 2006 and their full-length genome sequences were obtained by using RT-PCR method. The E gene sequences from additional 6 dengue fever patients in Guangzhou in 2006 were also obtained by using RT-PCR method. Combined with DENVs sequences published in GenBank, phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis were performed. One hundred and twenty-five E gene sequences and 60 complete genome sequences published in the GenBank were also involved. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there was a wide genetic diversity of DENVs isolated in southern China. DENV-1 strains exist in almost all of the clades of genotype I and IV except the Asia 1 clade of genotype I; DENV-2 stains are grouped into four of the five genotypes except American genotype. DENV-4 strains are grouped into 2 genotypes (I and II). Phylogenetic analysis also showed that all DENV-4 isolates and two DENV-2 isolates were closely related to the prior isolates from neighboring Southeast Asia countries. The DENV-1 strain isolated during the 2006 epidemic is highly homologous to the strains isolated during the 2001 epidemic.Recombination analysis showed no inter-serotype recombination, but 22 intra-serotype recombination events were found across the 32 complete genomes of all Chinese isolates. The study suggested that dengue fever epidemic in Southern China over the past 30 years presented two important modes, 1) imported-cases-induced endemic prevalence; 2) endogenous epidemic outbreak with natural epidemic focus. Recombination may play an important role in dengue virus evolution and adaptation.",

        "abstract": "During 2009, an outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) enrolled 490 people in Henan Province, causing the death of two children. In order to investigate the pathogens responsible for this outbreak and characterize their genetic characteristics, a total of 508 clinical specimens (stool, throat swab, and vesicle fluid) were collected from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Henan Province. Virological investigations (virus isolation, conventional reverse transcription PCR, and real-time reverse transcription PCR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed. It was found that human enterovirus 71 (EV71) was the main pathogen causing this outbreak, while Coxsackievirus A16 (CoxA16) played only a subsidiary role. Phylogenetic analysis of 24 EV71 isolates collected during the period from March 11 to July 24, 2009 showed that they belonged to subgenotypes C4 and C5. Our study for the first time characterizes the epidemiology of HFMD and EV71 infection in Henan Province in 2009 and provides the first direct evidence of the genotype of EV71 circulating in Henan Province at that time. Our study should facilitate the development of public health measures for the control and prevention of HFMD and EV71 infection in at-risk individuals in China.",

Before the PCR assays were carried out, the restriction enzymes were used to cut wild alleles. The results showed that this method could detect mutant alleles mixed samples containing 0.1% with a cutoff \u0394Ct value of 12. We used this method in a survey of 73 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples, detecting 14 mutant samples of E746_A750del and 12 mutant samples of L858R. The results well agreed with the results of DxS. All unmatched samples were identified by sequencing and the results showed that our method has high specificity.The mutant-enriched ARMS TaqMan PCR could be useful in the detection of mutation in clinical samples containing only a small number of mutant alleles.",

In this study, a scheme for typing IncHI into five separately clustering subgroups, including previously designated IncHI1-3 as well as IncHI4-5, was proposed based on sequenced IncHI plasmids. The complete nucleotide sequences of the IncHI2 plasmids pT5282-mphA and p112298-catA and the IncHI5 plasmid pYNKP001-dfrA from clinical Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Raoultella ornithinolytica isolates, respectively, were determined and were compared with IncHI2 and IncHI5 reference plasmids. Considerable genetic conservation was observed within the backbone sequences of each of the IncHI2 and IncHI5 subgroups, but the backbone sequences of the two subgroups were dramatically different from each other. However, the conjugal transfer regions tra1 and tra2 as well as the tellurium resistance gene cluster ter were present in all five plasmids. A number of accessory regions associated with integrons, transposons and insertion sequence-based mobile elements have been inserted at various sites of the plasmid backbones, among which were several large regions harbouring genes conferring resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. Data generated from this study provide us with a deeper understanding of the diversification of IncHI-type resistance plasmids.",

Genome sequencing of four representative strains, namely Proteus mirabilis GN2, Serratia marcescens GN26, Morganella morganii GN28, and Klebsiella aerogenes E20, indicated the presence of blaKPC-2-carrying IncX6 plasmids pGN2-KPC, pGN26-KPC, pGN28-KPC, and pE20-KPC in the four strains, respectively. These plasmids were genetically closely related to one another and to the only previously sequenced IncX6 plasmid, pKPC3_SZ. Each of the plasmids carried a single accessory module containing the blaKPC-2/3-carrying \u0394Tn6296 derivatives. The \u0394Tn6292 element from pGN26-KPC also contained qnrS, which was absent from all other plasmids. Overall, pKPC3_SZ-like blaKPC-carrying IncX6 plasmids were detected by PCR in 44.4% of the KPC-producing isolates, which included K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, S. marcescens, M. morganii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and were obtained from six different departments of the hospital. Data presented herein provided insights into the genomic diversity and evolution of IncX6 plasmids, as well as the dissemination and epidemiology of blaKPC-carrying IncX6 plasmids among Enterobacteriaceae in a hospital setting.",

The backbones of p0716-KPC/p12181-KPC contained two different replicons (belonging to a novel IncFII subtype and the Rep_3 family), the IncFII and IncFII maintenance regions, and conjugal transfer gene sets from IncFII-type plasmids and unknown origins. p0716-KPC and p12181-KPC carried similar three accessory resistance regions, namely \u0394Tn6209, a MDR region, and the bla  region. Resistance genes bla , mph(A), strAB, aacC2, qacE\u03941, sul1, sul2, and dfrA25, which are associated with transposons, integrons, and insertion sequence-based mobile units, were located in these accessory regions. p0716-KPC carried two additional resistance genes: aphA1a and bla . Together, our analyses showed that p0716-KPC and p12181-KPC belong to a novel IncFII subtype and display a complex chimeric nature, and that the carbapenem resistance gene bla  coexists with a lot of additional resistance genes on these two plasmids.",

The tensile modulus and compression modulus of interlayer and intralayer hybrid composites are the same under the same mixed ratio, the tensile strength is much superior to the compression strength, and while the tensile modulus and strength increase along with the carbon fiber content, the compression values change slightly. The influence of stacking structures on the tensile and compressive strengths is opposite to the ratio of T/C (tensile/compression) strength for interlayer hybrid composites, and while the tensile and compression strengths with glass fiber sandwiching carbon fiber can reach the maximum value, the ratio of T/C strength is minimum. For structures with carbon fiber sandwiching glass fiber, or with asymmetric structures, the tensile and compressive strengths are at a low value. For intralayer hybrid structures, while the carbon/glass (C/G) dispersion degree is high, the tensile and compression strengths are low. The experimental tensile and compressive strengths for interlayer and intralayer hybrid composites are greater than the theoretical values, which demonstrates that strength conforms well to the positive hybrid effect. The tensile fracture strain is greater than the compression fracture strain for hybrid composites, with both of them basically maintained at the same level.",

        "abstract": "The effects of hybridization on the flexural properties of interlayer and intralayer Carbon/Glass (C/G) composites were explored in this work. First, the theoretical analysis of stress distribution on interlayer hybrid composites was discussed. The experimental results showed that the layer structure is the critical factor affecting the flexural properties for interlayer hybrid composites, and the mixed ratio has no obvious impact. Since the carbon fiber is distributed at the top or bottom surface, the interlayer composites can obtain the maximum flexural modulus. Some structures can even achieve the same modulus as the pure carbon composites, and an excellent flexural strength can be attained with the carbon fiber located in the bottom layer. In terms of the intralayer hybrid composites, the fracture strain, flexural modulus, and flexural strength basically change linearly as the glass fiber content increases, which is consistent with the calculated values via the rule of mixture (ROM). Additionally, the C/G mixed ratio has a decisive effect on the flexural properties of intralayer hybrid composites; however, they are affected weakly by the layer structure. In general, some structures of the interlayer hybrid composites exhibit better flexural properties than that of the intralayer hybrid composites at the same C/G hybrid ratio; the alterations in layer structures make it possible to obtain excellent flexural properties for interlayer hybrid composites with less carbon fiber.",

        "abstract": "The compression properties and mechanisms of interlayer and intralayer Carbon/Glass (C/G) hybrid composites were investigated in this work. As revealed from the experimental results, the compression modulus increases linearly with the increase of carbon fiber content, following the rule of mixtures (ROM). The C/G hybrid ratio is regarded as the decisive factor for the compression modulus of hybrid composites. The positive mixing effect exists on compression strength for interlayer and intralayer hybrid composites, whereas the experimental values are above the theoretical calculation values. The compressive strength of interlayer hybrid composites taking on various hybrid structures differs largely at the same mixed ratio, at which the compressive strength of glass fiber sandwiching carbon fiber is higher than that of carbon fiber sandwiching glass fiber. Through comparing interlayer and intralayer hybrid composites, the impact exerted by layer structures on the compressive strength of interlayer hybrid composites is higher than that of intralayer hybrid composites, which leads to more designable characteristics for interlayer hybrid composites. This work makes it possible to optimize the compression strength of interlayer hybrid structures so that it achieves or basically exceeds pure carbon fiber composites.",

In the work reported in this paper, a meso-scale model based on the real geometry of glass fiber non-crimp fabric (NCF) was developed, and an attempt for the parametric modeling has been made. First, the buckling of warp yarns due to the tension of stitching yarn has been considered, and the buckling can be described by a curve equation. In addition, cross-sectional characterizations of warp and weft yarns were studied via metallographic observations, and 3D models have been constructed. Second, the path of the polyester stitching yarn was extracted by the tracer fiber technique and fitted by the B-spline spline curve; this trace can be can be simplified to several equations in Matlab.

Firstly, the compaction mechanism of NCFs was analyzed, it suggested the compaction process is mainly characterized by the decrease of macro pores and micro pores, a novel and reasonable constitutive model (porous elastic) was proposed. Then, the feasibility of modeling the compaction process for NCFs with the porous elastic material via FEM was explored. A macroscale model of NCF was established firstly, the simulation complies well to the experimental results. Then, the mesoscale models were attempted, and the effect of model parameters on simulation results were investigated, including the model size, platen location, warp cross-sectional shape. Results show that the size of mesoscale model and compaction platen position have little effect on the compaction behavior, while the cross-sectional shape of the warp yarn has a slight influence on the simulation results. Finally, compared the warp yarn cross-section changes of simulation with experimental data, it was revealed that variations in yarn cross sections in the model have a good agreement with experimental results, except that the macro-porosity differs slightly.",

        "abstract": "The spread of rumor or misinformation in social networks may cause bad effects among the public. Thus, it is necessary to find effective strategies to control the spread of rumor. Specifically, in our paper, we consider such a setting: initially, a subset of nodes is chosen as the set of protectors, and the influence of protector diffuses competitively with the diffusion of rumor. However, in real world, we generally have limited budget (limited number of protectors) and time to fight with rumor. Therefore, we study the problem of maximizing rumor containment within a fixed number of initial protectors and a given time deadline. Generalizing two seminal models in the field\u2014the Independent Cascade (IC) model and the Linear Threshold (LT) model\u2014we propose two new models of competitive influence diffusion in social networks with the following three factors: a time deadline for information diffusion, random time delay of information exchange and personal interests regarding the acceptance of information. Under these two models, we show that the optimization problems are NP-hard. Furthermore, we prove that the objective functions are submodular. As a result, the greedy algorithm is used as constant-factor approximation algorithms with performance guarantee \\(1-\\frac{1}{e}\\) for the two optimization problems.",

In this paper we investigate the community detection problem based on the concept of terminal set. A terminal set is a group of users within which any two users belong to different communities. Although the community detection is hard in general, the terminal set can be very helpful in designing effective community detection algorithms. We first present a 2-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time for the original community detection problem. In the other issue, in order to better support real applications we further consider the case when extra restrictions are imposed on feasible partitions. For such customized community detection problems, we provide two randomized algorithms which are able to find the optimal partition with a high probability.

        "abstract": "Social networks allow rapid spread of ideas and innovations while the negative information can also propagate widely. When the cascades with different opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first is the most likely to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is detected, a natural containment method is to introduce a positive cascade competing against the rumor. Given a budget k, the rumor blocking problem asks for k seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated within a factor of (1 \u2212 1/e\u2212 \u03b4) by a classic greedy algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation with the running time of O(k 3  mn ln n/\u03b4 2 ), where n and m are the number of users and edges, respectively. Unfortunately, the Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods are extremely time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a randomized algorithm which runs in O(km ln n/\u03b4 2 ) expected time and provides a (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 \u03b4)-approximation with a high probability. The experimentally results on both the real-world and synthetic social networks have shown that the proposed randomized rumor blocking algorithm is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art method and it is able to find the seed nodes which are effective in limiting the spread of rumor.",

Given an initiator who want to friend a target person on a social network, we propose a strategy to support active friending through a series of recommendation lists. The lists serve as a step-to-step guidance for the initiator. We formulate an optimization problem, Constrained Active Friending  CAF ), for configuring the recommendation lists in the active friending process. Our goal is to maximize the acceptance probability of the invitation from the initiator to the friending target, by recommending selective intermediate friends to approach the target. We prove that  CAF  problem is NP-hard under the linear threshold model. We propose an algorithm based on discrete super-differentials that derives a guaranteed approximation for this problem.

By offering coupons to seed buyers, there is a chance to convince the influential users who are, however, at first not very interested in the product. In this paper, we propose a coupon based online influence model and consider the problem that how to maximize the profit by selecting appropriate seed buyers. The considered problem herein is markedly different from other influence related problems as its objective function is not monotone.

Research on barrier coverage has mainly focused on the  lifetime maximization  and the  critical conditions  to achieve    $k$   -Barrier Coverage under various sensing models. When sensors are randomly deployed along the boundary of an area of interest, they may form several disjoint barrier covers. To maximize the lifetime of barrier coverage, those barrier covers need to be scheduled to avoid a security problem, call  breach . In a heterogeneous wireless sensor network, given a set of barrier-covers each with a lifetime, we study the problem of finding a lifetime-maximizing subset with a breach-free sleep-wakeup scheduling. We first prove that it can be judged in polynomial time whether a given sleep-wakeup schedule is breach-free or not, but given a set of barrier-covers, it is NP-Complete to determine whether there exists a breach-free schedule. Then, we show that the problem of finding a lifetime-maximizing breach-free schedule is equivalent to the maximum node weighted path problem in a directed graph, and design a parameterized algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the heuristics proposed in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Usage of Multi-Channel in wireless network brings new challenges to algorithm design for network operations. In this paper we discuss the minimum latency broadcast problem (MLB) in multi-channel multi-hop wireless networks (MLB-MC). This problem is NP-hard since its special version, MLB in single-channel network (MLB-SC) is proved to be NP-hard (57). We design an efficient approximation for MLB-MC, analyze its approximation ratio, and evaluate its performance via numerical experiments. Furthermore, we give a general theorem as an upper bound to compare the performance between approximations for MLB-MC and MLB-SC. We also consider Minimum Interference Connected Dominating Set Problem in multi-radio multi-hop wireless network, in which each node is equipped with multiple interfaces and all nodes cooperate together to fulfill a network task. Routing based on a connected dominating set (CDS) is a frequently used approach, where the searching space for a route is reduced to the nodes in this set. CDS is actually a virtual backbone of multi-hop wireless network. To improve wireless network throughput, in this paper we firstly define the minimum interference connected dominating set problem in a multi-radio multi-hop wireless network, and then propose two different algorithm for which theoretical analysis are given. However, due to the characteristics of the problem it self, it is difficult to compute the approximation ratio for our algorithms. Simulation results compare these two proposed algorithms. Next we study the dominating optimization problem with multiple channels and multiple radios in wireless sensor networks. The objective is to maximize the number of targets covered while selecting at most k nodes and at most ki channels with each selected node vi. Our problem is a general case of the maximum coverage problem. We propose two algorithms. The first one is base on linear programming and PIPAGE rounding and its approximation ratio is 1K1- 1-1mm , where m is the number of the dominating nodes and K = maxi\u2208I ki. And the second algorithm is based on greedy strategy with low time complexity. The simulation shows that the two algorithms both have good performance. With concern of minimize energy consumption for wireless network in multi-channel environment, we also study the minimum energy broadcast problem (MEB-MB) in multi-channel wireless ad hoc networks that use directional antennas. We propose a constant ratio approximation algorithm named MST-MB for MEB-MC and provide its approximation ratio. Experiment results evaluate the performance of MST-MB. We investigate the positive influence dominating set (PIDS) which has applications in social networks. We prove that PIDS is APX-hard and propose a greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio of H(\u03b4) where H is the harmonic function and \u03b4 is the maximum vertex degree of the graph representing a social network. Motivated from application in social networks, a new type of dominating sets has been studied in the literature. In this paper, we present results on its complexity and approximation in general graphs.",

        "abstract": "Influence maximization problem is to find a set of seeds in social networks such that the cascade influence is maximized. Traditional models assume that all nodes are willing to spread the influence once they are influenced, and they ignore the disparity between influence and profit of a product. In this paper, by considering the role that price plays in viral marketing, we propose price related (PR) frame that contains PR-I and PR-L models for classic independent cascade and linear threshold models, respectively, which is a pioneer work. Two pricing strategies are designed, one is binary pricing (BYC), in which the seeds are offered free samples. The other is panoramic pricing (PAP), in which the seeds are offered different discounts. Furthermore, we find that influence and profit are like two sides of the coin, high price hinders the influence propagation and to enlarge the influence some sacrifice on profit is inevitable. Based on this observation under PR frame, by adopting a parameter to denote the decision maker\u2019s preference toward influence and profit, we propose balanced influence and profit (BIP) maximization problem. We prove the NP-hardness of BIP maximization under PR-I and PR-L model. Unlike influence maximization, the BIP objective function is not monotone. Despite the nonmonotony, we show BIP objective function is submodular under certain conditions. Two unbudgeted greedy algorithms separately, named algorithm of BYC and algorithm of PAP are devised. We conduct extensive simulations on real world data sets, test the effectiveness of our proposed parameters, compare the algorithms\u2019 performances, and evaluate the superiority of our algorithms over existing ones.",

However, we need to take effective measures such as blocking a set of links to control the negative rumors spreading over the network. In this article, we propose a Rumor Spread Minimization (RSM) problem, i.e., we remove an edge set from network such that the rumor spread is minimized. We first prove the objective function of RSM problem is not submodular. Then, we propose both submodular lower-bound and upper-bound of the objective function. Next, we develop a heuristic algorithm to approximate the objective function. Furthermore, we reformulate our objective function as the DS function (the Difference of Submodular functions). Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate our proposed method. The experiment results show that the upper and lower bounds are very close, which indicates the good quality of them. And, the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods.\n\n",

With a majority voting protocol, a location survives for read/write operations if and only if it is accessible to more than half of the replicas.

However, when the number of replicas is even, it was pointed out by Hu et al. that uniform placements are not optimal and the optimal placement problem may be very complicated. In this paper, we study the optimal placement problem in a ring network with majority voting protocol and an even number of replicas, and give a complete characterization of optimal placements when the number of replicas is not too large compared with the number of locations.",

We assume that the map tasks are parallelized, i.e., it can be arbitrarily split and parts of the same task can be processed on different machines in parallel, while the reduce tasks are non-parallelizable. We consider both the offline and online scheduling problems. On offline version, if the reduce tasks are non-preemptive, we design an approximation algorithm whose worst case ratio is at most    max   {  1  +    \u0394    2    \u2212    1    n    ,  \u0394  }    , where    \u0394  =      v    1        v    n        is the ratio of the fastest speed to the slowest speed. If the reduce tasks are preemptive, we provide an approximation algorithm with worst case ratio of    2   . On online version where jobs arriving over time, we design two heuristics for non-preemptive and preemptive reduce tasks respectively. In experiment, we verify the advantage of our algorithms comparing with the state-of-the-art.",

In this paper, firstly we argue that in online social networks, due to the time sensitivity of popular topics, the assumption in IC or LT model that the influence propagates endlessly in the network, is not applicable. Based on this we consider influence transitivity and limited propagation distance in our new model. Secondly, under our model we propose Semidefinite based algorithms. While most existing algorithms rely on monotony and submodularity to obtain approximation ratio of $$1-1/e$$1\u00bf1/e, when no size limitation exists on the number of seeds, our algorithm achieves approximation ratio with $$0.857$$0.857, which is a great improvement. Moreover, when only a limited number of nodes can be chosen as seeds, based on computer-assisted proof, we claim our algorithm still keeps approximation ratio higher than $$1-1/e$$1\u00bf1/e if the ratio of the seeds to the total number of nodes resides in a certain range. At last, we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms through extensive experiments on real world social networks.",

        "abstract": "Misinformation and rumor can spread rapidly and widely through online social networks and therefore rumor controlling has become a critical issue. It is assumed in the existing works that there is a single authority whose goal is to minimize the spread of rumor by generating a positive cascade. In this paper, we study a more realistic scenario when there is multiple positive cascades generated by different agents. For the multiple-cascade diffusion, we propose the peer-to-peer independent cascade model for private social communications. The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of the rumor blocking effect (i.e., the number of the users activated by rumor) when the agents noncooperatively generate the positive cascades. We show that the rumor blocking effect provided by the Nash equilibrium will not be arbitrarily worse even if the positive cascades are generated noncooperatively. In addition, we give a discussion on how the cascade priority and activation order affect the rumor blocking problem. We experimentally examine the Nash equilibrium of the proposed games by simulations done on real social network structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Given a social network  G  and a positive integer  k , the  influence maximization  problem seeks for  k  nodes in  G  that can influence the largest number of nodes. This problem has found important applications, and a large amount of works have been devoted to identifying the few most influential users. But most of existing works only focus on the diffusion of a single idea or product in social networks. However, in reality, one company may produce multiple kinds of products and one user may also have multiple adoptions.  For multiple kinds of different products with different activation costs and profits, it is crucial for the company to distribute the limited budget among multiple products in order to achieve profit maximization. The  Profit Maximization with Multiple Adoptions  (PM 2 A) problem aims to seek for a seed set within the budget to maximize the overall profit. In this paper, a  Randomized Modified Greedy  ( RMG ) algorithm based on the Reverse Influence Sampling (RIS) technique is presented for the PM 2 A problem, which could achieve a    (  1  \u2212  1  /  e  \u2212  e  )   -approximate solution with high probability and is also the best performance ratio of the PM 2 A problem. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world social networks are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our  RMG  algorithm outperforms the algorithm proposed in  [16]  and other heuristics in terms of profit maximization, and could better allocate the budget.",

        "abstract": "For the purpose of propagating information and ideas through a social network, a seeding strategy aims to find a small set of seed users that are able to maximize the spread of the influence, which is termed influence maximization problem. Despite a large number of works have studied this problem, the existing seeding strategies are limited to the models that cannot fully capture the characteristics of real-world social networks. In fact, due to high-speed data transmission and large population of participants, the diffusion processes in real-world social networks have many aspects of uncertainness. As shown in the experiments, when taking such uncertainness into account, the state-of-the-art seeding strategies are pessimistic as they fail to trace the influence diffusion. In this paper, we study the strategies that select seed users in an adaptive manner. We first formally model the dynamic independent Cascade model and introduce the concept of adaptive seeding strategy. Then, based on the proposed model, we show that a simple greedy adaptive seeding strategy finds an effective solution with a provable performance guarantee. Besides the greedy algorithm, an efficient heuristic algorithm is provided for better scalability. Extensive experiments have been performed on both the real-world networks and synthetic power-law networks. The results herein demonstrate the superiority of the adaptive seeding strategies to other baseline methods.",

Specifically, the presence of an item in one transaction strongly implies the presence of every other item that belongs to the same hyperclique pattern. In this paper, we present an algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns, which specifies a more compact representation of hyperclique patterns and are desirable for many applications, such as pattern-based clustering. Our algorithm exploits key advantages of both the Depth First Search (DFS) strategy and the Breadth First Search (BFS) strategy. Indeed, we adapt the equivalence pruning method, one of the most efficient pruning methods of the DFS strategy, into the process of the BFS strategy. Our experimental results show that the performance of our algorithm can be orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms, particularly at low levels of support.",

        "abstract": "Recently, various hybrid wireless sensor networks which consist of several robotic vehicles and a number of static ground sensors have been investigated. In this kind of system, the main role of the mobile nodes is to deliver the messages produced by the sensor nodes, and naturally their trajectory control becomes a significant issue closely related to the performance of the entire system. Previously, several communication power control strategies such as topology control are investigated to improve energy-efficiency of wireless sensor networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no communication power control strategy has been investigated in the context of the hybrid wireless sensor networks. This paper introduces a new strategy to utilize the communication power control in multiple data ferry assisted wireless sensor network for long-term environmental monitoring such that the lifetime of the sensor network is maximized. We formally define the problem of our interest and show it is NP-hard. We further prove there exists no approximation algorithm for the problem which can produce a feasible solution for every possible problem instance even though there is a feasible solution. Then, we propose heuristic algorithms along with rigorous theoretical performance analysis for both the single data ferry case and the multiple data ferry case under certain condition.",

        "abstract": "Locating source of information diffusion in networks has very important applications such as locating the sources of epidemics, news/rumors in social networks or online computer virus. In this paper, we consider detecting multiple rumor sources from a deterministic point of view by modeling it as the set resolving set (SRS) problem. Let G be a network on n nodes. A node subset K is an SRS of G if all detectable node sets are distinguishable by K. The problem of multiple rumor source detection (MRSD) in the network can be modeled as finding an SRS K with the smallest cardinality. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time greedy algorithm for finding a minimum SRS in a general network, achieving performance ratio $$O(\\\\ln n)$$O(lnn). This is the first work establishing a relation between the MRSD problem and a deterministic concept of SRS, and a first work to give the minimum SRS problem a polynomial-time performance-guaranteed approximation algorithm. Our framework suggests a robust and efficient approach for estimating multiple rumor sources independent of diffusion models in networks.",

        "abstract": "In a social network, influence diffusion is the process of spreading innovations from user to user. An activation state identifies who are the active users who have adopted the target innovation. Given an activation state of a certain diffusion, effector detection aims to reveal the active users who are able to best explain the observed state. In this paper, we tackle the effector detection problem from two perspectives. The first approach is based on the influence distance that measures the chance that an active user can activate its neighbors. For a certain pair of users, the shorter the influence distance, the higher probability that one can activate the other. Given an activation state, the effectors are expected to have short influence distance to active users while long to inactive users. By this idea, we propose the influence-distance-based effector detection problem and provide a 3-approximation. Second, we address the effector detection problem by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. We prove that the optimal MLE can be obtained in polynomial time for connected directed acyclic graphs. For general graphs, we first extract a directed acyclic subgraph that can well preserve the information in the original graph and then apply the MLE approach to the extracted subgraph to obtain the effectors. The effectiveness of our algorithms is experimentally verified via simulations on the real-world social network.",

The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed. This paper makes four contributions. First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority. Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of \u03a9(2log1\u2212\u03f5n4) in polynomial time unless NP\u2286DTIME(npolylogn). Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks. Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem.

        "title": "Maximizing Activity Profit in Social Networks",
        "abstract": "In the past decade, tremendous research effort has been devoted to viral marketing. Most existing works on seed selection in social networks do not take into account the scenario when a profit can be generated from group activities. Each activity has a profit that can be measured by the excitement of the participants. The excitement about one piece of information can vary significantly among different groups of people. Given a social network and a profit function, how can we select the seed users to maximize the expected total amount of profit? This problem is essentially different from the classic influence maximization problem, and existing approaches cannot be directly applied to solve the problem. In this paper, we study the problem of activity profit maximization in social networks. We first prove that the maximizing activity profit problem is nondeterministic polynomial time-hard and cannot be approximated within a constant factor by the simple greedy algorithm. Supermodular degree of a function measures the extent to which it violates submodularity. We design an algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${1}/({\\Delta +2}))$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n provided that the supermodular degree of the social graph is bounded with \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Delta $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. We then develop an exchange-based technique to further improve the quality of the solution. We also devise a randomized variation approach to overcome the computational burden of the proposed algorithms. Extensive experimental results on three real benchmark data sets demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms over several baseline heuristics.",

        "abstract": "The coverage and connectivity problems are the most fundamental but essential category of problems we need to deal with in various networks. They involve all kinds of aspects of networks, varying from the management of networks, such as the monitoring of the sensor networks, to the application of networks, such as the application of viral marketing in the social networks. Abstracting various networks as graphs, the coverage problems concern how to select a subset of nodes from the graphs so that the rest of the nodes are covered. And the connectivity problems concern how to connect a given set of nodes in the graphs together so that the cost is minimized. In this dissertation, considering the importance of the coverage and connectivity problems in various networks, we first study the algorithm design and analysis of several optimization problems that are highly related. The specific optimization problems related to the coverage problems that we study are the Minimum Connected Dominating Set problem in the 3-dimensional space, modeled by unit ball graphs, and the Minimum-Weighted Dominating Set problem in the 2-dimensional space, modeled by unit disk graphs. Utilizing the optimization strategies, we propose our own approximation algorithms for these problems. Systematic theoretical analysis and studies show that both of our algorithms outperform the existing work in the literature and are considered the best results up till now. The specific optimization problems related to the connectivity problems that we study are the Selected-Internal Steiner Minimum Tree and the Node-Weighted Steiner Minimum Tree. We proposed a (1+&epsi;)-approximation algorithm for selected-internal Steiner minimum tree problem based on the best known result of the Steiner minimum tree. We also propose the first constant approximation algorithm and a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for the node-weighted Steiner tree on unit disk graphs as well. Afterwards, we study several coverage and connectivity problems arisen from real scenarios in various networks as applications. The first coverage and connectivity problem we study about is the virtual backbone construction in the wireless networks. We provide both theoretical and experimental studies for the construction of a virtual backbone in the wireless networks considering three essential factors (size, diameter and fault tolerance) together. To our knowledge, it is the first work to study these three factors in a single model in the literature. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, in our study, we testify our claim on the existence of tradeoffs between these three factors using both theoretical analysis and simulations. Results prove the correctness of our claim. Secondly, we provide an approximation algorithm with both low time and space complexity for this problem and the performance is adjustable by user defined input. Another application of the coverage and connectivity problem we study about is from social networks, which have attracted a massive attention in the recent years. Motivated by its wide applications in marketing and the importance of bounding the latency of information spreading in it, we propose a new problem called Fast Information Propagation problem. We first study the hardness of this problem and then we propose a performance-bounded approximation algorithm to address it. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large collaboration network to verify that our algorithm outperforms the node-selection heuristics, which utilizes the well-known approaches based on the node centrality in the social network analysis.",

Mining such patterns is important for many spatio-temporal application domains. However, a co-occurrence analysis across multiple spatio-temporal datasets is computationally expensive when the dimension of the time series and number of locations in the spaces are large. In this paper, we first defined STCOPs and the STCOPs mining problem. We proposed a monotonic composite measure, which is the composition of the spatial prevalence and temporal prevalence measures. A novel and computationally efficient algorithm, Costcop+, is presented by applying the composite measure. We proved that the proposed algorithm is correct and complete in finding STCOPs. Using a real dataset, the experiments illustrate that the algorithm is efficient.",

This dissertation contains researches on novel approaches for data transmission, dissemination, and communication problems, to satisfy new requirements from clients, to improve current system performance, and to optimize existing transmission protocols. The whole project can be divided into two parts. In the first part, we mainly discuss data management, data scheduling, indexing technology, and data transmission problems for Wireless Data Broadcast, a new data dissemination method for wireless and mobile users to retrieve database information. We design a novel and automatic system named SAMBox for data broadcast under asynchronous multi-channel wireless communication environment, including index design, data structure construction, and channel scheduling algorithm, with optimized parameter selection. We then propose several exact algorithms to data scheduling problem for a special kind of database management system: multi-media databases. These algorithms are the first approaches for wireless data broadcast under the fourth generation network with MIMO technology. Next, we give a novel data dissemination algorithm, which saves around 50% energy comparing with current system. This part also includes three approximations for query dissemination in a special type of wireless network, wireless sensor network. In the second part, we focus on the theoretical analysis for data transmission problem over \u201cbackbone\u201d network, which is usually represented as connected dominating set (CDS) in a communication network model. The routing protocols rely on such infrastructure can simplify the routing process and improve system performance. Thus it is desirable to choose a minimum CDS for efficiency. We are aiming at constructing a \u201cgood\u201d backbone effectively by optimizing the selection strategies innovatively and analyzing the approximation ratio carefully. We provide a constant-factor (10+&epsis;) approximation algorithm for weighted connected dominating set problem, which is much smaller than the existing literature. We prove a better theoretical bound to approximate dominating set using Euler formula. And finally, we give the first polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for d-hop connected dominating set problem.",

In this system, when a user poses a query to this sensor database, the query will be disseminated across the database. During this process, each sensor generates data that match the query from its covered area and then returns the data to the original sensor. In order to achieve an energy-efficient implementation, it will be useful to select a minimally sufficient subset of sensors to keep active at any given time. Thus, how to find a subset efficiently is an important problem for sensor database system. We define this problem as sensor database coverage (SDC) problem. In this paper, we reduce the SDC problem to connected set cover problem, then present two approximation algorithms to select a minimum connected set cover for a given sensor database. Moreover, to guarantee robustness and accuracy, we require a fault-tolerant sensor database, which means that each target in a query region will be covered by at least m sensors, and the selected sensors will form a k -connected subgraph. We name this problem as (k ,m )-SDC problem and design another approximation algorithm. These three algorithms are the first approximation algorithms with guaranteed approximation ratios to SDC problem. We also provide simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms. We compare the results with algorithms in [17]. The comparison proves the efficiency of our approximations. Thus, our algorithms will become a new efficient approach to solve coverage problem in sensor database systems.",

If furthermore G[R] is k-connected and every element in V is covered by at least m sets in R, then R is a (k,m)-CSC.

        "abstract": "In this study, we formalize a multi-focal learning problem, where training data are partitioned into several different focal groups and the prediction model will be learned within each focal group. The multi-focal learning problem is motivated by numerous real-world learning applications. For instance, for the same type of problems encountered in a customer service center, the problem descriptions from different customers can be quite different. The experienced customers usually give more precise and focused descriptions about the problem. In contrast, the inexperienced customers usually provide more diverse descriptions. In this case, the examples from the same class in the training data can be naturally in different focal groups. As a result, it is necessary to identify those natural focal groups and exploit them for learning at different focuses. The key developmental challenge is how to identify those focal groups in the training data. As a case study, we exploit multi-focal learning for profiling problems in customer service centers. The results show that multifocal learning can significantly boost the learning accuracies of existing learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for classifying customer problems.",

All the existing solutions focus on how to maximize the influence of the initially selected \"influential nodes\", paying no attention on how the influential nodes selection could maximize the speed of the diffusion. In this paper, we consider the problem of influential nodes selection regarding to the propagation speed in social network information diffusion. We define a discrete optimization problem, called Fast Information Propagation Problem . We show that this problem is NP-hard problem when the time requirement for information propagation is exactly 1-hop. We also propose a Latency-bounded Minimum Influential Node Selection Algorithm to solve the problem in this case.",

One challenge is to design decoding algorithms for determining whether a clone is positive based on the test outcomes and a binary matrix representing the pools. This is more difficult in practice due to errors in biological experiments. More challenging still is a third category of clones called 'inhibitors' whose effect is to neutralise positives. We present a novel decoding algorithm identifying all positive clones in the presence of inhibitors and experimental errors.",

As an application of the restricted submodularity, we present a worst-case analysis of a greedy algorithm for Network Steiner tree adapted from a heuristic originally proposed by Chang in 1972 for Euclidean Steiner tree. The performance ratio of Chang's heuristic is a longstanding open problem due to the nonsubmodularity of its potential function. As an application of the shifted submodularity, we present a worst-case analysis of a greedy algorithm for Connected Dominating Set generalized from a greedy algorithm proposed by Ruan et al. Such generalized greedy algorithm is shown to have performance ratio at most (1 + \u03b5)(1 + ln(\u0394 - 1)), which matches the well-known lower bound (1-\u03b5)ln \u0394, where \u0394 is the maximum vertex-degree of input graph and \u03b5 is any positive constant.",

Such a problem has a lot of applications in image processing and clustering, and was proved to be NP-hard. In this paper, we study $$BCP_k$$ on a special class of graphs: trapezoid graphs whose maximum degree is bounded by a constant. A pseudo-polynomial time algorithm is given, based on which an FPTAS is obtained for $$k=2,3,4$$. A step-stone for the analysis of the FPTAS depends on a lower bound for the optimal value of $$BCP_k$$ in terms of the total weight of the graph. In providing such a lower bound, a byproduct of this paper is that any 4-connected trapezoid graph on at least seven vertices has a 4-contractible edge, which may have a value in its own right.",

        "abstract": "Hyperclique patterns are groups of objects which are strongly related to each other. Indeed, the objects in a hyperclique pattern have a guaranteed level of global pairwise similarity to one another as measured by uncentered Pearson's correlation coefficient. Recent literature has provided the approach to discovering hyperclique patterns over data sets with binary attributes. In this paper, we introduce algorithms for mining maximal hyperclique patterns in large data sets containing quantitative attributes. An intuitive and simple solution is to partition quantitative attributes into binary attributes. However, there is potential information loss due to partitioning. Instead, our approach is based on a normalization scheme and can directly work on quantitative attributes. In addition, we adopt the algorithm structures of three popular association pattern mining algorithms and add a critical clique pruning technique. Finally, we compare the performance of these algorithms for finding quantitative maximal hyperclique patterns using some real-world data sets.",

When some of meteorological variables have some special change tendency, some kind of severe weather will happen in most cases. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, DIAL to discover potential relations between the special change tendency and the severe weather. The algorithm consists three parts: (1) Change the original static database recording the weather condition data into a new database with the changing tendency of every measurements of the weather; (2) Discover multi-dimensional association rules from the new generated database; (3) Use the predefined predicts to transfer the interval rules into the dynamic interdimension association rules.",

To extend the lifetime of multi-hop wireless networks, it is essential to have an efficient routing scheme. It is known that by employing a virtual backbone in a wireless network, the efficiency of any routing scheme for the network can be improved. A smaller virtual backbone incurs less maintenance overhead. For this reason, many people used the minimum Connected Dominating Set (CDS) problem, which is a well-known NP-hard problem, to abstract the problem of computing quality virtual backbones in wireless networks. In Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Chapter 4, we improve the existing results in this area in several aspects.

        "abstract": "Wireless networks can have properties not present in traditional wired networks. There is no physical backbone, and wireless nodes may be operating with a limited energy supply, as is the case for wireless sensor networks. We can adapt the idea of a wired network's physical backbone, creating virtual backbones. Therefore, in this dissertation, we examine how we might construct a virtual backbone for improved energy efficiency in broadcasting and routing. In detail, we consider cluster-based routing and CDS construction with guaranteed routing cost. We propose a new problem based on customer fairness, which looks for a minimum CDS in a given communication model with shortest path constraints. It guarantees that any two clients can communicate with each other through this CDS with hop counts the same as the best path from the original graph, which means that routing on such a CDS will not bring additional traffic for every client.Since the shortest path constraint is very strict, we study a CDS with relaxed constraint, in which we guarantee any two clients can communicate with hop count a most a constant factor from that in the original graph. We propose a heuristic algorithm, and we demonstrate that this relaxation is helpful since the CDS size is reduced greatly. To further save energy consumption, we apply directional antennas to CDS construction. We study a special virtual backbone (VB) using directional antennas, requiring that from one node to any other node in the network, there exists at least one directional shortest path all of whose intermediate directions should belong to the VB. Previously, Minimum Average Routing Path Clustering Problem (MARPCP) in multi-hop USNs was studied. The goal of this problem is to find a clustering of a USN so that the average clustering-based routing path from a node to it nearest underwater sink is minimized. We relaxed MARPCP to a special case of Minimum Weight Dominating Set Problem (MWDSP), for which we propose a PTAS. Derived from this result, we give a (3 + &epsi;)-approximation algorithm for MARPCP.",

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal data mining, i.e., mining knowledge from large amount of spatio-temporal data, is a highly demanding field because huge amounts of spatio-temporal data have been collected in various applications, ranging from remote sensing, to geographical information systems (GIS), computer cartography, environmental assessment and planning, etc. The collection data far exceeded human\u2019s ability to analyze which make it crucial to develop analysis tools. Recent studies on data mining have extended to the scope of data mining from relational and transactional datasets to spatial and temporal datasets. Among the various forms of spatio-temporal data, remote sensing images play an important role, due to the growing wide-spreading of outer space satellites. In this dissertation, we proposed two approaches to analyze the remote sensing data. The first one is about applying association rules mining onto images processing. Each image was divided into a number of image blocks. We built a spatial relationship for these blocks during the dividing process. This made a large number of images into a spatio-temporal dataset since each image was shot in time-series. The second one implemented co-occurrence patterns discovery from these images. The generated patterns represent subsets of spatial features that are located together in space and time. A weather analysis is composed of individual analysis of several meteorological variables. These variables include temperature, pressure, dew point, wind, clouds, visibility and so on. Local-scale models provide detailed analysis and forecasts of meteorological phenomena ranging from a few kilometers to about 100 kilometers in size. When some of above meteorological variables have some special change tendency, some kind of severe weather will happen in most cases. Using the discovery of association rules, we found that some special meteorological variables\u2019 changing has tight relation with some severe weather situation that will happen very soon. This dissertation is composed of three parts: an introduction, some basic knowledges and relative works, and my own three contributions to the development of approaches for spatio-temporal data mining: DYSTAL algorithm, STARSI algorithm, and COSTCOP+ algorithm.",

        "title": "Projected clustering and pooling designs",
        "abstract": "We can describe clustering problems as finding groups of data points so that the points in each group are similar to each other according to their attributes (dimensions). Clustering has been discussed thoroughly by both the statistics and database communities due to its numerous applications in problems such as machine learning, data mining, indexing, trend analysis, and pattern recognition. We proposed a projected clustering algorithm IPROCLUS [15, 16] (Improved PROCLUS) to deal with data in high dimensions. Since data may not be correlated in all dimensions, it is more meaningful to consider clusters in subspaces of full dimensions. We thoroughly investigated the projected clustering problem, in which the subsets of dimensions selected are specific to the clusters themselves. We found that, besides the distance, the closeness of points in different dimensions also depends on the distributions of data along those dimensions. The proposed approach is efficient and accurate in handling data in high dimensional space. We compared IPROCLUS with PROCLUS [1], one of projected clustering algorithms, in the experimental study. Our algorithm shows much higher accuracy for the scaled datasets and lower dependence on one user input. We also applied IPROCLUS on real biological data and it can achieve much better accuracy than PROCLUS. The word bioinformatics has become a very popular \u201cbuzz\u201d word in science. Bioinformatics involves the integration of computers, software tools, and databases in an effort to address biological questions. Pooling designs are used in DNA library screening to efficiently distinguish positive clones from negative clones. A challenge appears in pooling designs when it is not easy to find unique probes due to a high degree of similarity of targets. We studied how to select a minimum set of non-unique probes to identify the presence of at most d targets in a sample where each non-unique probe can hybridize to a set of targets. We proposed efficient approximation algorithms to select a minimum number of probes using d-disjunct matrix [66]. Our algorithms can identify the presence of at most d targets in a case of at most k experimental errors. In addition, we analyzed the running time of how to decode the test results. We also proposed an Integer Linear Programming method to select a minimum number of non-unique probes to identify up to d targets in a sample using d-disjunct matrix [14]. The results show that the decoding time is much faster than that of the methods using d-separable matrix while running time and solution size are comparable.",

        "abstract": "A hyperclique pattern [12] is a new type of association pattern that contains items which are highly affiliated with each other. More specifically, the presence of an item in one transaction strongly implies the presence of every other item that belongs to the same hyperclique pattern. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns, which are desirable for pattern-based clustering methods [11]. This algorithm exploits key advantages of both the Depth First Search (DFS) strategy and the Breadth First Search (BFS) strategy. Indeed, we adapt the equivalence pruning method, one of the most efficient pruning methods of the DFS strategy, into the process of the BFS strategy. As demonstrated by our experimental results, the performance of our algorithm can be orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms, particularly at low levels of support.",

To address its frequent network partition issue, recently a special kind of infrastructure called the Roadside Unit (RSU) is proposed to be deployed along the road to improve the VANET connectivity. In this paper, we study the energy saving problem in RSU scheduling. Given a set of deployed RSUs, our objective is to find the optimal schedule of turning them on and off within a given time period so that the overall energy consumption of RSUs in the system is minimized while the network connectivity is still maintained. We divide this problem into two subproblems called the snapshot scheduling problem and the snapshot selection problem. The snapshot scheduling problem decides the minimum number of active RSUs needed for a snapshot of the VANET at a given time point, while the snapshot selection problem decides a sequence of time points on which the snapshot must be updated. By addressing these two subproblems, we present a complete solution for our energy-efficient RSU scheduling. We present our theoretical analysis and experimental results to show that our algorithms can achieve a significant energy saving while still maintaining the VANET connectivity.",

        "abstract": "Temperature and salt concentration are very helpful experimental conditions for a probe to hybridize uniquely to its intended target. In large families of closely related target sequences, the high degree of similarity makes it impossible to find a unique probe for every target. We studied how to select a minimum set of non-unique probes to identify the presence of at most d targets in a sample where each non-unique probe can hybridize to a set of targets.We proposed efficient algorithms based on Integer Linear Programming to select a minimum number of non-unique probes using d-disjunct matrices.

The experimental results show that the decoding time is much faster than that of the methods using d-separable matrices while running time and solution size are comparable.Since finding unique probes is often not easy, we make use of non-unique probes. Minimizing the number of non-unique probes will result in a smaller DNA microarry design which leads to a smaller chip and considerable reduction of cost. While minimizing the probe set, the decoding ability should not be diminished. Our non-unique probes selection algorithms can identify up to d targets with error tolerance and the decoding complexity is O(n).",

Informally it is to select few people to be activated in a social network such that their aggregated influence can make as many as possible people active. Kempe et al. gave a $(1-{1 \\over e})$ -approximation algorithm for this problem in the linear threshold model and the independent cascade model. In addition, Chen et al. proved that the exact computation of the influence given a seed set is #P-hard in the linear threshold model. Both of the two models are based on randomized propagation, however such information might be obtained by surveys and data mining techniques. This will make great difference on the complexity of the problem. In this note, we study the complexity of the influence maximization problem in deterministic linear threshold model. We show that in the deterministic linear threshold model, there is no n 1\u9a74\u9a74 -factor polynomial time approximation for the problem unless P=NP. We also show that the exact computation of the influence given a seed set can be solved in polynomial time.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have applications in many areas, such as biomedical observation, environmental monitoring, and battlefield surveillance. In order to reduce costs and improve reliability, target coverage has been an important problem for WSNs in recent years. In this paper, we investigate target coverage for a special kind of WSNs, called directional sensor networks, in which the sensors have limited monitoring distance and coverage angle. Given a set of targets and a set of sensors, we investigate how to assign proper directions for the sensors such that the number of covered targets is maximised. We show that it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution and we investigate both centralised and distributed approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantee. In addition, we analyse the problem itself from the combinatoricsu0027 point of view. Finally we also conduct a simulation experiment to evaluate the practical performance of proposed algorithms.",

With the development of The Fourth Generation Wireless Network (4G), wireless data broadcast has gained a lot of interest because of its scalability, flexibility, and energy efficiencies for wireless mobile computing. How to apply full-text search to documents transmitted through wireless communications is thus a research topic of interest. In this paper, we propose a novel data streaming scheme (named Basic-Hash) with hash-based indexing and inverted list techniques to facilitate energy and latency efficient full-text search in wireless data broadcast. We are the first work utilizing hash technology for this problem, which takes much less access latency and tuning time comparing to the previous literature. We further extend the proposed scheme by merging the hashed word indices in order to reduce the total access latency (named Merged-Hash). An information retrieval protocol is developed to cope with these two schemes. The performances of Basic-Hash and Merged-Hash are examined both theoretically and empirically. Simulation results prove their efficiencies with respect to both energy consumption and access latency",

        "abstract": "Online social networks are becoming a true growth point of Internet. As individuals constantly desire to interact with each other, the ability for Internet to deliver this networking influence becomes much stronger. In this paper, we study the online social influence maximization problem, which is to find a small group of influential users that maximizes the spread of influence through networks. After a thorough analysis of existing models, especially two classical ones, namely Independent cascade and linear thresholds, we argue that their idea that each user can only be activated by its active neighbors is not applicable to online social networks, since in many applications there is no clear concept for the issue of \"activation\". In our proposed influence model, if there is a social influence path linking two nonadjacent individuals, the value of influence between these two individuals can be evaluated along the existing social path based on the influence transitivity property under certain constraints. To compute influence probabilities between two neighbors, we also develop a new method which leverages both structure of networks and historical data. With reasonably learned influence probabilities, we recast the problem of online influence maximization to a weighted maximum cut problem which analyzes the influence flow among graph vertices. By running a semidefinite program-based (GW) algorithm on a complete influence graph, an optimal seed set can be identified effectively. We also provide experimental results on real online social networks, showing that our algorithm significantly outperforms greedy methods.",

In general conditions, the most important two issues for queries in mobile computing systems are the energy cost and the query response time. In order to improve the query efficiency, we develop a randomized algebraic algorithm that takes both energy cost and access time into consideration to schedule the data retrieval process in multi-channel environments.

As we know, the most important issues in mobile computing are energy efficiency and query response efficiency. However, in data broadcast the objectives of reducing access latency and energy cost can be contradictive to each other.

Access Latency and Tuning Time are two main criteria to evaluate the performance of such system. With the help of indexing technology, clients can reduce tuning time significantly by searching indices first and turning to doze mode during waiting period. Different indexing schemes perform differently, so we can hardly compare the efficiency of different indexing schemes. In this paper, we redesigned several most popular indexing schemes for data broadcasting systems, i.e., distributed index, exponential index, hash table, and Huffman tree index. We created a unified communication model and constructed a novel evaluation strategy by using the probability theory to formulate the performance of each scheme theoretically and then conducted simulations to compare their performance by numerical experiments. This is the first work to provide scalable communication environment and accurate evaluation strategies. Our communication model can easily be modified to meet specific requirements. Our comparison model can be used by the service providers to evaluate other indexing schemes to choose the best one for their systems.",

In many applications, such as stock quotes and flight schedules, users may have to download multiple data items per request. However the multi-item request scheduling has not yet been thoroughly investigated for on-demand wireless data broadcasts. In this paper, we step-up on investigating this problem from viewpoint of theory and simulation. We develop a two-stage scheduling scheme to arrange the requested data items with the objective of minimizing the average access latency. The first stage is to select the data items to be broadcast in the next time period and the second stage is to schedule the broadcasting order for the data items selected in the first stage. We develop algorithms for the two stages respectively and analyze them both theoretically and practically. We also compare the proposed algorithms with other well known scheduling methods through simulation. The theoretical findings and simulation results reveal that significantly better access latency can be obtained by using our scheduling scheme rather than its competitors.",

        "abstract": "Influence maximization problem is to find a set of seeds in social networks such that the cascade influence is maximized. Traditional models assume all nodes are willing to spread the influence once they are influenced, and they ignore the disparity between influence and profit of a product. In this paper by considering the role that price plays in viral marketing, we propose price related (PR) frame that contains PR-I and PR-L models for classic IC and LT models respectively, which is a pioneer work. We find that influence and profit are like two sides of the coin, high price hinders the influence propagation and to enlarge the influence some sacrifice on profit is inevitable. We propose Balanced Influence and Profit (BIP) maximization problem. We prove the NP-hardness of BIP maximization under PR-I and PR-L model. Unlike influence maximization, the BIP objective function is not monotone. Despite the non-monotony, we show BIP objective function is sub modular under certain conditions. Two unbudgeted greedy algorithms separately are devised. We conduct simulations on real-world datasets and evaluate the superiority of our algorithms over existing ones. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "A Connected Dominating Set (CDS) can be used to construct a virtual backbone for wireless and mobile ad-hoc networks to make the system hierarchical and efficient. A virtual backbone can significantly improve network throughput, optimize broadband utilization, extend network lifetime, and reduce interference as well as packet retrans- missions. Calculating a minimum backbone for a network is critical to reduce routing computation and energy consumption. This problem is a well-known NP-hard optimiza- tion problem, which has various applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a new problem based on customer fairness, which looks for a minimum CDS in a given com- munication model with shortest path constraints. It guarantees that any two clients can communicate with each other through this CDS with hop counts the same as the best path from the original graph, which means that routing on such a CDS will not bring additional traffic for every client. We name this problem as shortest path connected dom- inating set (SPCDS) and prove its NP-hardness by reduction from Hitting Set .T hen we propose a centralized greedy algorithm and an efficient distributed approximation algorithm with approximation ratio \u2206 to solve SPCDS, where \u2206 is the maximum vertex degree in the given topology. We also analyze the time complexity, message complexity, and evaluate the efficiency of our distributed heuristic by several numerical experiments and comparisons with previous literatures.",

In this paper, we study the data retrieval scheduling problem for multi-item requests in multi-channel broadcast environments. To maximize the number of downloads given a deadline, we define a problem called largest number data retrieval (LNDR). We prove the decision problem of LNDR is NP-hard, and we investigate approximation algorithm for it. We also define another problem called minimum cost data retrieval (MCDR), which aims at downloading a set of requested data items with the least response time and energy consumption. We prove MCDR is NP-hard to approximate to within any non-trivial factor. Therefore, we investigate heuristic algorithm for it. Finally we provide simulation results to demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Mobile computing can be equipped with wireless devices to allow users retrieving information from anywhere at anytime. Recently, wireless data broadcast becomes a popular data dissemination method, especially for broadcasting public information to a large number of mobile subscribers at the same time. Access Latency and Tuning Time are two main criteria to evaluate the performance of a data broadcast system. Indexing can dramatically reduce tuning time by guiding clients to turn into doze mode while waiting for the data to arrive. B+-Tree Distributed Index Scheme (BTD) is a popular index scheme for wireless data broadcast, which has been extended by many research works. Among traditional index structures, alphabetic Huffman tree is another important tree-based index technique with the advantage of taking data's access frequency into consideration. In this paper, we are trying to answer one question: can alphabetic Huffman tree replace B+-tree and provide better performance? To answer this question, we propose a novel Huffman-Tree based Distributed Index Scheme (HTD) and compare its performance with BTD based on a uniform communication environment. The performances of HTD and BTD are analyzed both theoretically and empirically. With the analysis result, we conclude that HTD outperforms BTD and can replace BTD in most existing wireless data broadcast system.",

        "abstract": "MultiMedia DataBase Management System (MMDBMS) becomes more popular in recent years, which supports complex and large multimedia data like images, audios, and videos etc. Data Broadcasting is an attractive approach for data dissemination to improve the limitations in mobile environment, such as narrow bandwidth, unreliable connections, and battery limitation. However, existing data broadcast schemes are inefficient for MMDBMS. In this paper, we present four novel multimedia data broadcast schemes (namely, SDAA, MDAA, AEA, and COA) specifically for wireless multichannel communications. The major strategies are scalable coding to generate data segments to different qualities, indexing and channel assignment to minimize the expected waiting time for clients. We prove theoretically that SDAA is a 2-approximation. COA performs best when we release the constraints and it can be judged as an theoretical lower bound, while AEA outputs local optimal solution with quality allocation constraints. Finally, SDAA+AEA form a best scheduling for practical applications. We also provide numerical experiments to evaluate the system performance, proving the efficiency of our schemes.",

        "abstract": "As the wireless technology overwhelmingly occupies the consumer electronics market, the booming demands of the mobile users are largely unaccommodated. Thus wireless data broadcasting systems gain increasing attentions recently. Two wellknown metrics for evaluating wireless data broadcasting systems are Access Latency and Tuning Time. In order to reduce these two factors, many existing techniques have to make a tradeoff between the power consumption and the quality of services. In this paper, an energy-efficient Hybrid Asynchronous Multiple Hashing scheme named HAMHash for multi-channel broadcasting systems was proposed, which deals with variable data size and non-flat distribution of queries in multi-channel circumstance. Furthermore, algorithms of data allocation and retrieval for skewed broadcast are presented. Quantitative theoretical and experimental analysis of the system performance verifies the effectiveness of our scheme.",

        "abstract": "Abstract-Influence Maximization is the problem of finding a certain amount of people in a social network such that their aggregation influence through the network is maximized. In the past this problem has been widely studied under a number of different models. In 2003, Kempe et al. gave a (1 - 1/\u03f5) approximation algorithm for the linear threshold model and the independent cascade model, which are the two main models in the social network analysis. In addition, Chen et al. proved that the problem of exactly computing the influence given a seed set in the two models is #P-hard. Both the linear threshold model and the independent cascade model are based on randomized propagation. However such information might be obtained by surveys or data mining techniques, which makes great difference on the properties of the problem. In this paper, we study the Influence Maximization problem in the deterministic linear threshold model. As a contrast, we show that in the deterministic linear threshold model, there is no polynomial time n1-\u03f5-approximation unless P=NP even at the simple case that one person needs at most two active neighbors to become active. This inapproximability result is derived with self-contained proofs without using PCP theorem. In the case that a person can be activated when one of its neighbors become active, there is a polynomial time \u03f5/(\u03f5-1)-approximation, and we prove it is the best possible approximation under a reasonable assumption in the complexity theory, NP \u2284 DTIME(nloglogn). We also show that the exact computation of the final influence given a seed set can be solved in linear time in the deterministic linear threshold model. The Least Seed Set problem, which aims to find a seed set with least number of people to activate all the required people in a given social network, is discussed. Using an analysis framework based on Set Cover, we show a O(logn)-approximation in the case that a peop- - le become active when one of its neighbors is activated.",

In this paper, the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem and the Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) problem in SNs are investigated based on the connectivity rule of SNs. We prove the two problems in SNs are NP-hard, and present two efficient algorithms for building dominating sets and connected dominating sets in SNs. The proposed algorithms use as input a given (connected) dominating set of the factor network, and yield a good approximation of an MDS or MCDS for the SN provided that the input is a good approximation of an MDS or MCDS for the factor network. We also derive several non-trivial bounds on the (connected) domination parameters of SNs. We believe this work is of theoretical interest in graph theory since SNs form a family of graphs. It may also motivate further research on dominating problems in SNs with their potential applications.",

In many applications, such as stock quotes, flight schedules and traffic news, the users may want to download multiple data items at one time and the applications may require the support of multi-channel architectures. This paper studies the problem of retrieving a set of data items from multiple wireless broadcasting channels such that all the requested data items can be downloaded with the least access time, namely Least Time Data Retrieval (LTDR). On one hand, we find that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor even if there are only two channels. On the other hand, we find that there exists a polynomial time (1+1/1-\u03b1)-approximation solution for an LTDR instance L if the optimal solution of L requirers \u03c4 time slots and (1-\u03b1)kT \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 kT, where k is a positive integer, \u03b1 is an arbitrary constant between 0 and 1, and T is the least common multiple of cycle lengths for all channels. We also derive a lower bound of polynomial time approximation for L matching that upper bound under the well known assumption P \u2260 NP. To improve the practical efficiency of the approximation solution, a heuristic is exhibited and tested by simulations.",

In many applications, such as stock quotes, flight schedules and traffic reports, the users may want to download multiple data items at one time and the application may require the support of a multichannel architecture. In this dissertation, we study the problem of downloading a set of data items from multiple wireless broadcasting channels. We divide the data retrieval problem into different situations to carry on the analysis. To maximize the number of downloads given a deadline, we study the Largest Number Data Retrieval (LNDR) problem. We prove that the decision LNDR problem is NP-hard, and we propose an approximation algorithm for it with provable performance ratio. To minimize the response time for downloading a set of data items, we study the Least Time Data Retrieval (LTDR) problem. We develop a deterministic algorithm and a randomized algorithm for different cases of LTDR. To minimize the power consumption for downloading a set of data items, we study the Minimum Cost Data Retrieval (MCDR) problem. When only considering the power consumption in channel switching, we prove that MCDR has a polynomial time O(log k)-factor approximation solution where k is the number of requested data items and there exists no polynomial time o(log k)-factor approximation solution for MCDR, unless P \u2260 NP. When considering the power consumption in both doze model and channel switching, we prove that MCDR is NP-hard to approximate to within any nontrivial factor, and we propose a heuristic algorithm to reduce the power consumption. We also provide simulation results to demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms. The simulation results show that significantly better performances can be obtained by using our data retrieval scheduling methods at the client side.",

In many information services, the users may query multiple data items at a time. In this paper, we study the data retrieval scheduling problem from the client's point of view.

When the time needed for channel switching can be ignored, a Maximum Matching optimal algorithm is exhibited for LNDR which requires only polynomial time; when the switching time cannot be neglected, LNDR is proven to be NP-hard and a greedy algorithm with constant approximation ratio is developed. We also prove that the MCDR problem is NP-hard to be approximated within to any nontrivial factor and a parameterized heuristic is devised to solve MCDR non-optimally.",

        "abstract": "Wireless data broadcast is an efficient way of disseminating data to users in the mobile computing environments. From the server's point of view, how to place the data items on channels is a crucial issue, with the objective of minimizing the average access time and tuning time. Similarly, how to schedule the data retrieval process for a given request at the client side such that all the requested items can be downloaded in a short time is also an important problem. In this paper, we investigate the multi-item data retrieval scheduling in the push-based multichannel broadcast environments. We prove the decision version of this problem is $({\\cal NP})$--complete, and we devise an algebraic algorithm to search for the best solution. We also develop a heuristic that can employ the algebraic algorithm to download a large number of items efficiently. When there is no replicated item in a broadcast cycle, we show that an optimal retrieval schedule can be obtained in polynomial time. The performances of proposed algorithms are analyzed theoretically and evaluated through simulation. The experimental results show that our algorithms can significantly reduce the access time for multi-item requests.",

        "abstract": "Wireless data broadcast has many advantages, which makes it suitable for distributing public information to a large number of mobile clients. There are many mobile services in which clients need to download multiple data items per request. In the first part of this thesis, we focus on investigating the complexity and approximation algorithms for the data retrieval problem in a multi-channel data broadcast environment. We formally define the minimum cost data retrieval (MCDR) problem which aims at downloading a set of data items from multiple channels with minimum cost. We further define the minimum switching data retrieval (MSDR) problem which concerns only the number of channel switchings, and the largest number data retrieval (LNDR) problem with the objective of downloading the largest number of requested data items in a given time duration. All these problems are proven to be NP-hard. We present an O(logn)-factor approximation for MSDR, which can be extended to solve MCDR. We also propose two &half;-approximation algorithms for LNDR. For a special case of LNDR, we provide an optimal solution based on dynamic programming. With the advance of the fourth-generation wireless communication system, mobile devices may embed MIMO antennae to setup multi-connections to a base station. We extend the retrieval scheduling problem to a more complicated parallel retrieval scheduling problem in the second part. We also propose two greedy heuristics named Least Switch Data Retrieval Protocol and Best First Data Retrieval Protocol as its solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to deal with data retrieval with MIMO antennae for wireless data broadcast. The last part of this thesis discusses how to apply full-text search to documents transmitted through wireless communications. We propose a novel data streaming scheme (Basic-Hash) with hash-based indexing and inverted list techniques to facilitate energy and latency efficient full-text search in wireless data broadcast. We further extend the proposed scheme by merging the hashed word indices in order to reduce the total access latency (Merged- Hash). The performances of Basic-Hash and Merged-Hash are validated both theoretically and empirically.",

In our model, as in related ones, beginning with an active seed set (adopters), an adoption action diffuses in a cascade fashion based on a stochastic rule. We demonstrate that under this model, maximizing individuals' adoption of a product, called the product adoption maximization (PAM) problem, is NP-hard, and the objective function for product adoption is sub-modular for time T (T = 1, 2) when the function for estimating the influence coming from neighbors is sub-linear. Hence, a natural greedy algorithm guarantees an approximation. Furthermore, we show that it is hard to approximate the PAM problem when the function for estimating the influence coming from neighbors is not sub-linear. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "In information age, the malevolent spreading of rumours on social networks put forward a new challenge to the security of network and society, it is extremely important to study the inherent laws of rumour spreading in online social networks and propose effective control strategies for rumours. In this paper, based on cellular automaton model, we propose a new rumour spreading model. We first show the propagation characteristics of online social networks rumours spread. Then experimental simulation is carried out under periodic boundary constraints in the process of rumour spread, and the result is compared with real data. In addition, the immunisation strategy to suppress the rumour spreading is analysed with detailed scenarios. The results show that the new model is indeed able to characterise the propagation behaviour on online social networks.",

(Competitive influence maximization in social networks, pp 306---311, 2007) conjectured that this problem is $${{\\\\mathcal {N}}}{{\\\\mathcal {P}}}$$NP-hard on arborescence directed into a root. In this short note, we show that the conjecture is true for the independent cascade (IC) model, which is the most studied model in the literature specifying how each node influences other nodes. Therefore, assuming $${\\\\mathcal {P}}\\\\ne {{\\\\mathcal {N}}}{{\\\\mathcal {P}}}$$P\u017aNP, there exists no polynomial-time algorithm for the influence maximization problem under the IC model on arborescence directed into a root. On the other hand, Wang et al. (J Comb Optim, doi:10.1007/s10878-016-9991-1, 2016) have shown that there exists polynomial-time algorithm for this problem under the linear threshold (LT) model. Hence, this pair of results is of theoretical interest since this is the first time to give a theoretical difference on computational complexity between the IC and LT models. We believe it may motivate further research for influence maximization on arborescence and other special graphs.",

In this paper, we formally define the problem of community expansion in social network, which is under the marketing promotional activities scenario. We propose three models, Adopter Model, Benefit Model and Combine Model, to present different promotion strategies over time, taking into consideration the community structure characters. Specifically, Adopter Model is based on the factors that can make an individual come into a community. Benefit Model considers the factors that attract more new members. Combine Model aims to find a balance between Adopter Model and Benefit Model. Then a greedy algorithm ETC is developed for expanding a community over time. Our results from extensive simulation on several real-world networks demonstrate that our Combine Model performs effectively and outperforms other algorithms. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2013.",

Currently, most influence models only deal with a single influence without the interference of other influences. Also, the influence spreading in previous models must be triggered by individuals who have been activated by the influence. In this paper, we argue that it is the attraction from a specific influence makes an individual choose to spread it among multiple influences. Inspired by charged system theory in physics, a new influence model is proposed, considering individual features and social structure features. It also gives a natural description about how individuals make decisions among multiple influences. Then a novel algorithm based on this model is provided to predict human behavior. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model and algorithm statistically outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.",

It first calculates nodes' shared neighborhood relationship in a snapshot network and deduces the weighted directed graph; then computes both historic information and current information and deduces updated weighted undirected graphs. A greedy algorithm is designed to find the community structure snapshot at each time step. One evaluation formula is proposed to measure the community similarity. Based on this evaluation, the latent communities can be found. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm not only discovers the real community structure but also eliminates the influence of noisy data for better understanding of real network structure and its evolution. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, an individual accepts a new piece of information based on her intrinsic interest as well as friends' influence. However, in most of the previous works, the factor of individual's interest does not receive great attention from researchers. Here, we propose a new model which attaches importance to individual's interest including friends' influence. We formulate the problem of maximizing the acceptance of information (MAI) as: launch a seed set of acceptors to trigger a cascade such that the number of final acceptors under a time constraint T in a social network is maximized. We then prove that MAI is NP-hard, and for time $$T = 1,2$$T=1,2, the objective function for information acceptance is sub-modular when the function for friends' influence is sub-linear in the number of friends who have accepted the information (referred to as active friends). Therefore, an approximation ratio $$(1-\\\\frac{1}{e})$$(1-1e) for MAI problem is guaranteed by the greedy algorithm. Moreover, we also prove that when the function for friends' influence is not sub-linear in the number of active friends, the objective function is not sub-modular.",

        "abstract": "Influence propagation has been widely studied in social networks recently. Most of these existing work mainly focuses on the individual influence or the seed set influence. However, a large range of real world applications are related with the influence from communities. In this paper, we argue that the specific structure of community makes the influence propagation from a community different from previous influence propagation from an individual or a seed set. Inspired by the charged system in the physic, a new community influence propagation model is built, which provides a natural description about the process of influence propagation and explains why the influence makes communities expand. Based on this physical model, we define the community expansion problem. And two objective functions are proposed for choosing proper candidates to enlarge a community, taking into account the cost and benefit. Then a linear programming approach is designed to maximize those two objective functions. To validate our ideas and algorithm, we construct experiments on three real-world networks. The results demonstrate that our model and algorithm are effective in choosing proper candidates for expanding a community, comparing to other two algorithms.",

Understanding how nodes interconnect in large graphs is an essential problem in many fields. In order to find connecting nodes between two nodes or two groups of source nodes in huge graphs, we propose a parallelized data-mining algorithm to get the shortest path between nodes in a social network based on HBase distributed key/value store. Our algorithm can achieve the shortest path among different nodes in network under the parallel environment. We analyze the social network model by this algorithm first, and then optimize the output from cloud platform by using the intermediary degrees and degree central algorithm. Finally, with a simulated social network, we validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The experiment results indicate that our algorithm can improve the efficiency of parallel breath-first search (BSF).",

To determine the clusterheads, we give the constraint of minimizing the expected average hop distance from a node to its neatest sink in order to minimize the energy consumption for data forwarding in the clustering-based routing scheme. To deal with the high complexity of the problem, we relax it to a special form of Minimum Weighted d-hop Dominating Set Problem(MW dDSP), Then we present two approximation algorithms and corresponding analyses for it. One is a greedy algorithm with approximation ratio O(Inn), another achieves a constant factor performance ratio. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.",

Given a set of sensors and a set of target points in a finite area, the objective of MDTCP is to cover the maximum number of target points by adjusting the directions of sensors.

Given a set of targets and a set of sensors with bounded lifetime, the maximum lifetime $k$ -coverage problem is to schedule active/sleeping status of sensors to maximize the time period during which every target is covered by at least $k$ active sensors. Previously, it was known that when the sensing ranges are uniform, this problem has a polynomial-time $4+\\\\varepsilon $ -approximation for $k=1$ and $6+\\\\varepsilon $ -approximation for $k=2$ .

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network has attracted a lot of attentions due to its broad applications in recent years and also introduces\n many challenges. Network lifetime is a critical issue in Wireless Sensor Networks. It is possible to extend network lifetime\n by organizing the sensors into a number of sensor covers. However, with the limited bandwidth, coverage breach (i.e, targets\n that are not covered) can occur if the number of available time-slots/channels is less than the number of sensors in a sensor\n cover. In this paper, we study a joint optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the coverage breach as well\n as to maximize the network lifetime. We show a \u201ctrade-off\u201d scheme by presenting two strongly related models, which aim to\n tradeoffs between the two conflicting objectives. The main approach of our models is organizing sensors into non-disjoint\n sets, which is different from the current most popular approach and can gain longer network lifetime as well as less coverage\n breach. We proposed two algorithms for the first model based on linear programming and greedy techniques, respectively. Then\n we transform these algorithms to solve the second model by revealing the strong connection between the models. Through numerical\n simulation, we showed the good performance of our algorithms and the pictures of the tradeoff scheme in variant scenarios,\n which coincide with theoretical analysis very well. It is also showed that our algorithms could obtain less breach rate than\n the one proposed in (Cheng et al. in INFOCOM\u2019 05, 2005).",

        "abstract": "When a large amount of sensors are randomly deployed into a field, how can we make a sleep/activate schedule for sensors to maximize the lifetime of target coverage in the field? This is a well-known problem, called Maximum Lifetime Coverage Problem (MLCP), which has been studied extensively in the literature. It is a long-standing open problem whether MLCP has a polynomial-time constant-approximation. The best-known approximation algorithm has performance ratio 1 + ln n where n is the number of sensors in the network, which was given by Berman et. al [1]. In their work, MLCP is reduced to Minimum Weight Sensor Coverage Problem (MWSCP) which is to find the minimum total weight of sensors to cover a given area or a given set of targets with a given set of weighted sensors. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time (4 + \u2208)-approximation algorithm for MWSCP and hence we obtain a polynomial-time (4 + \u03be)-approximation algorithm for MLCP, where \u2208 >; 0, \u03be >; 0.",

This paper studies the problem of how to organize hybrid sensor network, which consists of a number of energy-scarce ground sensors with homogenous initial battery level and energy-plentiful mobile sensors, to maximum the lifetime of barrier-coverage. Two key observations are (a) as the lifetime of each mobile sensor is much longer than that of the static ground sensors, each mobile sensor is capable of contributing multiple sensor barrier formations, and (b) no mobile sensor node can join two hybrid barriers which will be successively used to continuously protect the area of interest due to the moving delay. Based on these, we introduce a new maximum lifetime barrier-coverage problem in hybrid sensor network. We first propose a simple heuristic algorithm by combining existing ideas along with our own. Then, we design another efficient algorithm for the problem and prove that the lifetime of hybrid barrier constructed by this algorithm is at least three times greater than the existing one on average. Our simulation result shows that the second algorithm outperforms the first algorithm at least 33 percent and up to 100 percent.",

It explores how the efficient storage of data can fundamentally support intensive data access and queries, which enables sophisticated analysis. It also looks at how data processing and visualization help to communicate information clearly and efficiently. The second part of the book is devoted to the extraction of essential information and the prediction of web content. The book shows how Big Data analysis can be used to understand the interests, location, and search history of users and provide more accurate predictions of User Behavior. The latter two parts of the book cover the protection of privacy and security, and emergent applications of big data and social networks. It analyzes how to model rumor diffusion, identify misinformation from massive data, and design intervention strategies. Applications of big data and social networks in multilayer networks and multiparty systems are also covered in-depth.",

This paper proposes to deploy multiple sinks to control the worst case node-to-sink data latency in WSNs. The end-to-end latency in multihop wireless networks is known to be proportional to the hop length of the routing path that the message moves over. Therefore, we formulate the question of what is the minimum number of sinks and their locations to bound the latency as the minimum d-hop sink placement problem. We also consider its capacitated version. We show problems are NP-hard in unit disk graph UDG and unit ball graph, and propose constant factor approximations of the problems in both graph models. We further extend our algorithms so that they can work well in more realistic quasi UDG model. A simulation study is also conducted to see the average performance of our algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Network lifetime is a critical issue in Wireless Sensor Networks. It is possible to extend network lifetime by organizing the sensors into a number of sensor covers. However, with the limited bandwidth, coverage breach (i.e, targets that are not covered) can occur if the number of available time-slots/channels is less than the number of sensors in a sensor cover. In this paper, we study a joint optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the coverage breach as well as to maximize the network lifetime. We show a \"trade-off\" scheme by presenting two strongly related models, which aim to tradeoffs between the two conflicting objectives. The main approach of our models is organizing sensors into non-disjoint sets, which is different from the current most popular approach and can gain longer network lifetime as well as less coverage breach. We proposed two algorithms for the first model based on linear programming and greedy techniques, respectively. Then we transform these algorithms to solve the second model by revealing the strong connection between the models. Through numerical simulation, we showed the good performance of our algorithms and the pictures of the tradeoff scheme in variant scenarios, which coincide with theoretical analysis very well. It is also showed that our algorithms could obtain less breach rate than the one proposed in [2].",

        "abstract": "A critical aspect of applications with wireless sensor networks is network lifetime. Power-constrained wireless sensor networks are usable as long as they can communicate sensed data to a processing node. Sensing and communications con- sume energy, therefore judicious power management and sensor scheduling can effectively extend network lifetime. To cover a set of targets with known locations when ground access in the remote area is prohibited, one solution is to deploy the sensors remotely, from an aircraft. The lack of precise sensor placement is compensated by a large sensor population deployed in the drop zone, that would improve the probability of target coverage. The data collected from the sensors is sent to a central node (e.g. cluster head) for processing. In this paper we propose an efficient method to extend the sensor network life time by organizing the sensors into a maximal number of set covers that are activated successively. Only the sensors from the current active set are responsible for monitoring all targets and for transmitting the collected data, while all other nodes are in a low-energy sleep mode. By allowing sensors to participate in multiple sets, our problem formulation increases the network lifetime compared with related work (2), that has the additional requirements of sensor sets being disjoint and operating equal time intervals. In this paper we model the solution as the maximum set covers problem and design two heuristics that efficiently compute the sets, using linear programming and a greedy approach. Simulation results are presented to verify our approaches.",

This problem is NP-hard, and thus many efforts have been made to find a constant factor approximation algorithm for it, but never succeeded so far with arbitrary k \u2265 3 and m \u2265 1 pair. We propose a new strategy for computing a smaller-size 3-connected m-dominating set in a unit disk graph with any m \u2265 1. We show the approximation ratio of our algorithm is constant and its running time is polynomial. We also conduct a simulation to examine the average performance of our algorithm. Our result implies that while there exists a constant factor approximation algorithm for the k-connected m-dominating set problem with arbitrary k \u2264 3 and m \u2265 1 pair, the k-connected m-dominating set problem is still open with k > 3.",

However, the barrier coverage problem in wireless camera sensor networks WCSNs is different from that in scalar sensor networks. In this paper, based on k, \u03c9-angle coverage, we study the minimum k, \u03c9-angle barrier coverage problem in WCSNs. We first present the technique to deploy minimum number of camera sensors to form a k, \u03c9-angle barrier. Then propose a novel method to select the minimum number of camera sensors from an arbitrary deployment to form a k, \u03c9-angle barrier.

        "abstract": "A Virtual Backbone (VB) of a wireless network is a subset of nodes such that only VB nodes are responsible for routing-related tasks. Since a smaller VB causes less overhead, size is the primary quality factor of VB. Frequently, Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) are used to model 2D homogeneous wireless networks, and the problem of finding minimum VBs in the networks is abstracted as Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) problem in UDGs. In some applications, the altitude of nodes can be hugely different and UDG cannot abstract the networks accurately. Then, Unit Ball Graph (UBG) can replace UDG. In this paper, we study how to construct quality CDSs in UBGs in distributed environments. We first give an improved upper bound of the number of independent nodes in a UBG, and use this result to analyze the Performance Ratio (PR) of our new centralized algorithm C-CDS-UBG, which computes CDSs in UBGs. Next, we propose a distributed algorithm D-CDS-UBG originated from C-CDS-UBG and analyze its message and time complexities. Our theoretical analysis shows that the PR of D-CDS-UBG is 14.937, which is better than current best, 22. Our simulations also show that D-CDS-UBG outperforms the competitor, on average.",

In order to make routing and flooding efficient in such an infrastructureless network, Connected Dominating Set (CDS) as a virtual backbone has been extensively studied. Most of the existing studies on the CDS problem have focused on unit disk graphs, where every node in a network has the same transmission range. However, nodes may have different powers due to difference in functionalities, power control, topology control, and so on. In this case, it is desirable to model such a network as a disk graph where each node has different transmission range. In this paper, we define Minimum Strongly Connected Dominating and Absorbent Set (MSCDAS) in a disk graph, which is the counterpart of minimum CDS in unit disk graph. We propose a constant approximation algorithm when the ratio of the maximum to the minimum in transmission range is bounded. We also present two heuristics and compare the performances of the proposed schemes through simulation.",

        "abstract": "Connected Dominating Set (CDS) has been a well known approach for constructing a virtual backbone to alleviate the broadcasting storm in wireless networks. Current research has focused on minimizing the size and diameter or improving the fault tolerance of CDS. However, to our best knowledge, no existing research has considered these three important factors together in a single model. In this paper, we introduce the fault tolerant model studying a joint optimization problem in which the objective is to minimize the CDS size as well as the network latency. This model also addresses the tradeoffs between the objective functions. We next propose one approximation algorithm and two distributed algorithms with constant ratios for the model. Simulation results show that our algorithms can gain good tradeoffs between the three factors, which coincide with theoretical analysis. Moreover, our algorithms could obtain a better performance than previous work.",

A virtual backbone of such a network is a strongly connected dominating and absorbing set SCDAS. This paper presents a 2 + \u03b5-approximation algorithm for the minimum dominating and absorbing set problem DAS, which, as far as we know, is the first one achieving a constant approximation ratio for DAS without requiring a bounded ratio of maximum transmission range over minimum transmission range. Based on such a DAS, a 4 + 3 ln2 + \u03b5opt + \u03b5-approximation algorithm for SCDAS is presented, where opt is the size of an optimal SCDAS, which improves on the previous approximation ratio 3Hn \u2212 1 \u2212 1, where n is the number of nodes, and H\u00b7 is the Harmonic function.",

A node in the subset is likely to be exhausted much faster than the others due to its heavy duties. This situation can be more aggravated if the node uses higher communication power to form the virtual backbone. In this paper, we introduce the minimum total communication power connected dominating set (MTCPCDS) problem, whose goal is to compute a virtual backbone with minimum total communication power. We show this problem is NP-hard and propose two distributed algorithms. Especially, the first algorithm, MST-MTCPCDS, has a worst case performance guarantee.

        "abstract": "In the minimum weighted dominating set problem (MWDS), we are given a unit disk graph with non-negative weight on each vertex. The MWDS seeks a subset of the vertices of the graph with minimum total weight such that each vertex of the graph is either in the subset or adjacent to some nodes in the subset. A weight function is called smooth, if the ratio of the weights of any two adjacent nodes is upper bounded by a constant. MWDS is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we give the first polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for MWDS with smooth weights on unit disk graphs, which achieves a (1+\u9a74)-approximation for MWDS, for any \u9a740.",

        "abstract": "Multi-hop wireless networks have no fixed physical backbone infrastructure, so Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is frequently selected as virtual backbone to improve network efficiency. Interference is a big problem which prevents wireless networks from reaching efficiency; however, previous works construct CDS as virtual backbone without consideration of interference. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to construct Minimum Interference Connected Dominating Set (MICDS) in multi-channel multi-radio multi-hop wireless networks. Multi-channel communication helps to reduce interference and improve network performance. A two-phase algorithm named MIS-colouring is presented for MICDS problem, and theoretical analysis is also given. However, due to the characteristics of the problem itself, it is quite difficult to compute the approximation ratio for MIS-colouring. Simulation results show that through proper CDS structure selection and channel assignment, MIS-colouring algorithm can minimise the total interference of CDS as a virtual backbone for multi-channel multi-radio multi-hop wireless networks.",

Previous literature modeled the wireless network in a 2-dimensional plane and looked for the approximated Minimum CDS (MCDS) distributed or centralized to construct the virtual backbone of the wireless network. However, in some real situations, the wireless network should be modeled as a 3-dimensional space instead of 2-dimensional plane. We propose our approximation algorithm for MCDS construction in 3-dimensional wireless network in this paper. It achieves better upper bound (13 + ln 10)opt+ 1 than the only known result 22opt.

Therefore, routing by MOC-CDS can guarantee that each routing path between any pair of nodes is also the shortest path in the network. Thus, energy consumption and delivery delay can be reduced greatly. CDS has been studied extensively in Unit Disk Graph (UDG) or Disk Graph (DG). However, nodes in networks may have different transmission ranges and some communications may be obstructed by obstacles. Therefore, we model network as a bidirectional general graph in this paper. We prove that constructing a minimum MOC-CDS in general graph is NPhard. We also prove that there does not exist a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for constructing a minimum MOCCDS with performance ratio pln\u03b4, where p is an arbitrary positive number (p <; 1) and \u03b4 is the maximum node degree in network. We propose a distributed heuristic algorithm (called as FlagContest) for constructing MOC-CDS with performance ratio (1 - ln2) + 2ln\u03b4. Through extensive simulations, we show that the results of FlagContest is within the upper bound proved in this paper. Simulations also demonstrate that the average length of routing paths through MOC-CDS reduces greatly compared to regular CDSs.",

        "abstract": "Many people studied the Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS) problem to introduce Virtual Backbone (VB) to wireless networks. However, many existing algorithms assume a static wireless network, and when its topology is changed, compute a new CDS all over again. Since wireless networks are highly dynamic due to many reasons, their approaches can be inefficient in practice. Motivated by this observation, we propose Recyclable CDS Algorithm (RCDSA), an efficient VB maintenance algorithm which can handle the activeness of wireless networks. The RCDSA is built on an approximation algorithm CDS-BD-C1 by Kim et. al. [1]. When a node is added to or deleted from current graph, RCDSA recycles current CDS to get a new one. We prove RCDSA's performance ratio is equal to CDS-BD-C1's. In simulation, we compare RCDSA with CDS-BD-C1. Our results show that the average size of CDS by RCDSA is similar with that by CDS-BD-C1 but RCDSA is at least three times faster than CDS-BD-C1 due to its simplicity. Furthermore, at any case, a new CDS by RCDSA highly resembles to its old version than the one by CDS-BD-C1, which means that using RCDSA, a wireless network labors less to maintain its VB when its topology is dynamically changing.",

Based on special characteristics of Ad-hoc and sensor networks, we usually use unit disk graphto represent the corresponding geometrical structures, where each node has a unit transmission range and two nodes are said to be adjacent if the distance between them is less than 1. Since every Maximal Independent Set (MIS) is a dominating set and it is easy to construct, we can firstly find a MIS and then connect it into a Connected Dominating Set (CDS). Therefore, the ratio to compare the size of a MIS with a minimum CDS becomes a theoretical upper bound for approximation algorithms to compute CDS. In our paper, with the help of Voronoi diagram and Euler's formula, we improved this upper bound, so that improved the approximations based on this relation.",

The whole algorithm has approximation ratio 17.421opt + 51.456, where opt is the number of nodes in an optimal 2-CDS set. Next we generalise this algorithm for d-CDS with arbitrary integer d. The generalisation also has a constant-factor approximation ratio (0.335 r\u00b3 + 1.337 r\u00b2 + 0.585 r)opt + (3.338 r\u00b3 + 0.5 r\u00b2 - 0.585 r), where r = d + 0.5.

This paper attempts to address the product which is used by many persons such as the online game. When multiple people participate in one game, interaction between users is accompanied by browsing and clicking on advertisements, and operators can also earn certain advertising revenues. All these revenues are related to information interaction between people involved in one game. We use game profit to represent all of the revenues gained from players involved in one game and model the game profit maximization problem in social networks, which finds a seed set to maximize the game profit between players who are influenced to buy the game. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. To solve it, we decompose it into the Difference between two Submodular functions (DS decomposition) and propose four heuristic algorithms. To address the complexity of computing objective function, we design a new sampling method based on reverse reachable set technology. Experiment results on real datasets show that our approaches perform well.",

        "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, social network serves as a platform for information diffusion, alongside with positive information (truth) dissemination, negative information (rumor) also spread among the public. To make the social network as a reliable medium, it is necessary to have strategies to control rumor diffusion. In this article, we address the Least Cost Rumor Blocking (LCRB) problem where rumors originate from a community Cr in the network and a notion of protectors are used to limit the bad influence of rumors. The problem can be summarized as identifying a minimal subset of individuals as initial protectors to minimize the number of people infected in neighbor communities of Cr at the end of both diffusion processes. Observing the community structure property, we pay attention to a kind of vertex set, called bridge end set, in which each node has at least one direct in-neighbor in Cr and is reachable from rumors. Under the OOAO model, we study LCRB-P problem, in which \u03b1 (0 <; \u03b1 <; 1) fraction of bridge ends are required to be protected. We prove that the objective function of this problem is submodular and a greedy algorithm is adopted to derive a (1-1/e)-approximation. Furthermore, we study LCRB-D problem over the DOAA model, in which all the bridge ends are required to be protected, we prove that there is no polynomial time o(ln n)-approximation for the LCRB-D problem unless P = NP, and propose a Set Cover Based Greedy (SCBG) algorithm which achieves a O(ln n)-approximation ratio. Finally, to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive comparison simulations in three real-world datasets, and the results show that our algorithm outperforms other heuristics.",

In this paper, source inference problem is tackled under Independent Cascade (IC) model. First, the #P-completeness of source inference problem is proven. Then, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to find a solution. It is worth noting that our algorithm is designed to handle large networks. In addition, the algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge of when the cascade started. Finally, experiments on real social network are conducted to evaluate the performance.

However, the social networks have communities. In our work, we aim at mining the invisible or missing relations between individuals within a community in social networks. We propose our algorithm according to the fact that the individuals exist in communities satisfying Nash Equilibrium, which is borrowed from game-theoretic concepts often used in economic researches. Each hidden relation is explored through the individual's loyalty to their community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of mining hidden links from the aspect of Nash Equilibrium. Eventually we confirm the superiority of our approach from extensive experiments over real-world social networks. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing 2013.",

In reality  a social network, crowd influence has been observed  it cannot be ignored when considering information diffusion problems. In this paper, we model crowd influence as a hyperedge  $e=(H_e,;v)$  with weight  $0leq P_eleq 1$  , where  $H_e$   the head node set and  $v$   the tail node, means  $v$  will be activated by  $H_e$  with probability  $P_e$  only after each node in  $H_e$   activated. Then, the Social Influence Maximization Problem  Hypergraph (SIMPH) aims to select  $k$  initially-influenced seed users  a directed hypergraph  $G=(V,;E,;P)$  . The objective is to maximize the expected number of eventually-influenced users. We show that SIMPH is NP-hard  the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. We develop a lower bound  an upper bound that are submodular. We prove maximizing these two bounds are NP-hard under IC model. Then we present a D-SSA algorithm for general weighted social influence maximization problem preserving (  $1-1/e-in$  )-approximation. We formulate a sandwich approximation framework, which preserves a theoretical analysis result. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on real world data sets.

We define the mutual closeness and strangeness between each vertex pairs, and formulate our problem as a semidefinite program considering both the tightness of the same community and the looseness across different communities. Two NP-hard issues are addressed. One is to partition the social networks into communities through maximizing the tightness within the same community and the looseness between different communities. In the other issue, we take community volume into consideration such that the obtained communities have similar sizes. We give the mathematical models and the objective functions, and then analyze the performance bounds of the proposed algorithms. At last, we validate our method's effectiveness by comparing them with a highly effective existing partitioning method on real-world and artificial data sets.",

        "abstract": "Light-trees can efficiently guarantee point-to-multipoint connection in optical networks for many widely used multicast applications, such as Internet protocol television (IPTV). The establishment of a light-tree requires the placement of 3R regenerators along the tree due to the wavelength continuity constraint and physical impairments. Thus, the problem is to establish a light-tree and to assign wavelengths such that the number of regenerators is minimized. We call this problem the efficient 3R regenerator placement (ERP) problem. If we fix the routing of the multicast tree, then how to place a minimum number of regenerators and assign wavelengths to links becomes a subproblem of ERP, which is named the wavelength assignment and regenerator placement (WARP) problem. We find that ERP is NP-hard, and then provide an approximation algorithm named SPT-ReWa, which has a subroutine named ReWa which can solve WARP optimally. We prove that ReWa can find an optimal solution for WARP, and we analyze the approximation ratio of SPT-ReWa for ERP. Finally, we illustrate several simulation scenarios to show the efficiency of SPT-ReWa.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed cooperative data transmission scheme for energy-rechargeable mobile devices. In particular, we not only let a mobile phone help the nearby client devices connect to the Internet via its cellular accessing, but also let those clients replenish the mobile hotspot energy via wireless power transfer. We mathematically formulate the mutually beneficial relationship between mobile hotspots and clients into an optimization problem, with the objective of conducting the cooperative wireless data and energy transmission to maximize the system utility. Resorting to methods from combinatorics and matching theory, we develop a near optimal solution for many-to-one matching when there is a single mobile hotspot and a distributed matching strategy for the general case by considering the nature of data communication and the characteristic of wireless power transfer. By extensive simulation, we show that the proposed distributed solution achieves a performance close to the centralized method, and it outperforms the greedy matching strategy and the classic Gale\u2013Shapley matching strategy in different scenarios.",

        "abstract": "A hyperclique pattern is a new type of association pattern that contains items which are highly affiliated with each other. Specifically, the presence of an item in one transaction strongly implies the presence of every other item that belongs to the same hyperclique pattern. In this dissertation, we present an algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns, which specifies a more compact representation of hyperclique patterns and are desirable for many applications, such as pattern-based clustering. Our algorithm exploits key advantages of both the Depth First Search (DFS) strategy and the Breadth First Search (BFS) strategy. Indeed, we adapt the equivalence pruning method, one of the most efficient pruning methods of the DFS strategy, into the process of the BFS strategy. Our experimental results show that the performance of our algorithm can be orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms, particularly at low levels of support. With the development of biology, microarray technology has been used to analyze relations between genes, cells and the other biological samples. Obviously, the microarray profiles are data sets containing quantitative attributes, where the relation values are not binary values. If we partition quantitative attributes into Boolean attributes there is potential information loss due to partitioning. Here, we design a new normalization scheme for such kind of dataset with quantitative attributes. Additionally, we adapt the algorithm structures of three popular association pattern mining algorithms and add a critical clique pruning technique for the hyperclique patterns in the normalized datasets. Mobile ad hoc networks are the next generation in communication networks. Devices can enter or leave the network anytime, devices can be mobile, and no centralized control points or base stations are necessary. This flexibility makes mobile ad hoc networks very interesting for the consumer and military market, but also makes them more complex than many existing wireless networks (such as GSM). Minimum-Weight Connected Dominating Set (MWCDS) problem is to select a vertex subset with minimum weight for a given unit disk graph, such that each vertex of the graph is contained in this subset or has a neighbor in this subset. Besides, the subgraph induced by this vertex subset is connected. It will be beneficial if we can get minimum weighted connected dominating set in the wireless network. We presents a (10 + &egr;)-approximation algorithm to compute MWCDS in unit disk graphs.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of processing supergraph queries on graph databases. A graph database D is a large set of graphs. A supergraph query q on D is to retrieve all the graphs in D such that q is a supergraph of them. The large number of graphs in databases and the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism testing make it challenging to efficiently processing supergraph queries. In this paper, a new approach to processing supergraph queries is proposed. Specifically, a method for compactly organizing graph databases is first presented. Common subgraphs of the graphs in a database are stored only once in the compact organization of the database, in order to reduce the overall cost of subgraph isomorphism testings from the stored graphs to queries during query processing. Then, an exact algorithm and an approximate algorithm for generating the significant feature set with optimal order are proposed, followed by the algorithms for indices construction on graph databases. The optimal order on the feature set is to reduce the number of subgraph isomorphism testings during query processing. Based on the compact organization of graph databases, a novel algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphisms from multiple graphs to one graph is presented. Finally, based on all the above techniques, a query processing method is proposed. Analytical and experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing similar algorithms by one to two orders of magnitude.",

In this paper, we propose a corpora subset selection method considering data contributions from time-continuous utterances and multi-label constraints that are not limited to single-scale metrics. Our goal is to extract a sufficiently rich subset from large corpora under certain meaningful constraints. In addition, taking into account the uniform coverage of the target subset and its internal property, we design a constrained subset selection algorithm. Specifically, a fast subset selection algorithm is designed by introducing n-grams models.

        "abstract": "Wireless Data Broadcasting is a new developed data dissemination method for spreading public information to a mass number of mobile subscribers. Access Latency and Tuning Time are two main criteria to evaluate the performance of a data broadcasting system. With the help of indexing technology, clients can reduce tuning time significantly by searching target data items through indices and turning to doze mode while waiting. Many different indexing schemes are developed under data broadcasting environment, such as distributed index, Hash scheme, etc. In this dissertation, several most popular indexing schemes for data broadcasting systems were redesigned, including distributed index, Huffman tree index, Hash scheme, and exponential index. A unified communication model was created, a novel evaluation strategy by probability theory was constructed to formulate the performance of each scheme theoretically, and the simulations were conducted to compare their performance by numerical experiments. Our communication model can easily be modified by service providers to satisfy their specific requirements. They can also evaluate other indexing schemes using our model, in order to choose the best scheme for their systems. Sensor database system is another popular and well-explored database system with sensor nodes as data sources that not only collect data but also combine stored data to provide information for the users who issue queries. Queries will be disseminated across the sensor database system, where each sensor generates data from the area it covers, and transmits the related data to the original sensor. Due to battery limitation of sensors, it is crucial to select a minimum yet sufficient subset of sensors to cover the query region while maintaining connectivity, in order to diminish the communication cost and energy consumption. This problem is defined as the Sensor Database Coverage (SDC) problem. In this dissertation, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the sensor database coverage problem was introduced. It is shown that when the number of targets is much less than the number of sensors, the algorithm has a performance ratio of O(log 3 n), which is better than existing algorithms. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance, and the results confirm the efficiency of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "As the wireless technology is overwhelmingly flooding the consumer electronics market nowadays, the swiftly booming demand of the mobile users is highly unsatisfiable. Under such condition the wireless data broadcasting system becomes a shining nova over the last decades which gains more and more attentions recently. There are two well-known criteria Access Latency and Tuning Time related to the power consumption and the quality of services, respectively. To improve the performance of the broadcasting system, many techniques have to make a tradeoff between the two criteria. However, indexing technology was the most promising approach which aims at speeding up the search process by mapping the physical location of data items into appropriate data structures and therefore enables the doze mode on clients' side during the broadcasting gaps. In this dissertation we consider two types of query patterns, one with access probability and the other with transition probability. For the pattern with access probability, we designed a special Hybrid Asynchronous Multiple Hashing scheme named HAMHash for multi-channel broadcasting systems, which deals with flexible data size and non-flat distribution of queries in multi-channel circumstance. For the other pattern with transition probability we use data clustering techniques to reduce the access latency while keeping a low tuning time, and on the clustering technique we also proposed a community structure detection problem which aims to analyze the relationships among the data via the network topology. We collect a series of unified definitions for community structures and formulate the community structure detection into a combinatorial optimization problem to identify as many communities as possible for a given network. For some well known community definitions, we prove that there is no polynomial time optimal solution for this maximum partition problem unless P=NP , and we develop a heuristic algorithm based on greedy strategy for it. The experimental results on many real networks show that the proposed algorithm is effective in terms of the number of valid communities and the modularity score.",

        "abstract": "The spatial and temporal databases have been studied widely and intensively over years. One of its applications is navigation system. In modern navigation systems, the essential problem is that how to compute the fastest path in the presence of varying traffic conditions on a road network. This dissertation contains researches on novel approaches for road network related problem The whole dissertation can be divided into five parts. In the first chapter, We will introduce the the whole dissertation. Some brief ideas will be presented. In the second chapter, we mainly discuss computing the optimal fast path on dynamic road network. The road speed may be affected by weather, time of day, and vehicle types. These factors cannot be ignored in order to find the fastest path that match current traffic conditions. In this work, we present an A star based fastest path algorithm to answer queries of finding the best departure time and optimal path to reach the destination as early as possible, where the traffic conditions dynamically change from time to time. In the third chapter, we focus on computing an approximate result to reduce the time complexity. An acceptable result with quick response is much better than the optimal result which takes long time to compute. We will study how to compute the fast path from source to destination in a road network, using traffic mining method. The result should satisfy the following two requirements: take into account speed-affecting factors; the response time must be in an acceptable range. In the forth chapter, we will introduce existing methods to collect traffic information. We will use a sensor database. In this system, an user's query will be disseminated across the system. During this process, each sensor generates data that match the query from its covered area and then returns the data to the original sensor. In order to achieve an energy-efficient implementation, it will be useful to select a minimally sufficient subset of sensors to keep active at any given time. In the fifth chapter, we will conclude the whole dissertation and state the future work.",

        "title": "Construction and computational complexity of pooling designs",
        "abstract": "DNA contains major information to control the development of any organism. This had been a distant dream until two restriction enzymes and DNA ligases were discovered in 1970s. This made it possible to manipulate DNA, create DNA Library and decode DNA. DNA Library Screening is very expensive since the number of defectives (probes) is very small when compared to the huge number of candidates (clones). It is a typical instance of group testing. Using d-disjunct matrices to construct non-adaptive pooling designs has been proved to be an efficient algorithm. Researchers have been trying different constructions by using different methods over the last two decades. There are two major problems in the previous works. The first is there is no general setting in pooling designs. The second one is there is no general procedure or tool to construct pooling designs. I propose a general setting in pooling design and a general procedure for constructing d-disjunct matrices by using the simplicial complex and graph property. The interactions between proteins are important in many biological functions. I use a complete graph to describe the protein-protein interaction problem, however the algorithm is not that efficient. I then use a d-disjunct matrix to solve the protein-protein interaction problem, and proposed four constructions for d-disjunct matrix, two non-adaptive algorithms and a generalization. Using non-unique probe brought a new challenge to the traditional pooling design. One positive outcome is a set of candidates rather than just one. The fundamental problem, that whether all viruses can be identified by using only non-unique probes, is solved in this dissertation. We found that all n viruses cannot be identified without using unique probes. Furthermore, for the considered n viruses, only n-2 viruses can be identified by using only non-unique probes. I conclude this dissertation with some useful conclusions on the computational complexity of pooling designs by reducing from the known NP problems.",

We refer to this problem as the energy-efficient IPTV simulcast (EES) problem. We first provide the problem definition of EES and prove that EES is NP-complete. We then formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and provide a heuristic approach, named VD-RingCover. We prove that the RingCover algorithm, which is a subroutine of VD-RingCover, can obtain the minimum energy consumption for the single base station case (named EES-SB). Our numerical results show that the MILP can solve the small scale problem properly and that the VD-RingCover achieves good results in both large and small scale problems.",

        "abstract": "Recent research in sensor networks highlights the low-power mode operation of sensor networks. In wireless sensor networks, network lifetime can be extended by organizing sensors into mutually exclusive subsets and alternatively activating each subset. Coverage breach occurs when a subset fails to cover all the targets. In bandwidth-constrained sensor networks, coverage breach is more likely to happen because when active sensors periodically send data to the base station, contention for channel access must be considered. Channel bandwidth imposes a limit on the cardinality of each subset. To make efficient use of both energy and bandwidth with minimum coverage breach requires optimal arrangement of sensor nodes. This article addresses three coverage breach problems related to the low-power operation of wireless sensor networks where channel bandwidth is limited. The three coverage breach problems are formulated using integer linear programming models. A greedy approximation algorithm and a heuristic based on the LP-relaxation method are proposed. Effects of changing different network resources on sensor network coverage are studied through simulations. One consistent result is that when the number of sensors increases, network lifetime can be improved without loss of network coverage only if there is no bandwidth constraint; with bandwidth constraints, network lifetime may be improved further at the cost of coverage breach.",

        "abstract": "Secure communication is a necessity for some wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. However, the resource constraints of a sensor render existing cryptographic systems for traditional network systems impractical for a WSN. Random key predistribution scheme has been proposed to overcome these limits. In this scheme, a ring of keys is randomly drawn from a large key pool and assigned to a sensor. Nodes sharing common keys can communicate securely using a shared key, while a path-key is established for those nodes that do not share any common keys. This scheme requires moderate memory and processing power, thus it is considered suitable for WSN applications. However, since the shared key is not exclusively owned by the two end entities, the established path-key may be revealed to other nodes just by eavesdropping. Based on the random-key predistribution scheme, we present a framework that utilizes multiple proxies to secure the path-key establishment. Our scheme is resilient against node capture, collusive attack, and random dropping, while only incurring a small amount of overhead. Furthermore, the scheme ensures that, with high probability, all path-keys are exclusively known by the two end nodes involved in the communication along the path.",

In this paper, we study the dual power assignment problem for 2-edge connectivity and 2-vertex connectivity in the symmetric graphical model. The problem has arisen from the following practical origin. In a wireless ad hoc network where each node can switch its transmission power between high-level and low-level, how can we establish a fault-tolerant connected network topology in the most energy-efficient way? Specifically, the objective is to minimize the number of nodes assigned with high power and yet achieve 2-edge connectivity or 2-vertex connectivity. Note that to achieve a minimum number of high-power nodes is harder than an optimization problem in the same model whose objective is to minimize the total power cost. We first address these two optimization problems (2-edge connectivity and 2-vertex connectivity version) under the general graph model. Due to the NP-hardness, we propose an approximation algorithm, called prioritized edge selection algorithm, which achieves a 4-ratio approximation for 2-edge connectivity. After that, we modify the algorithm to solve the problem for 2-vertex connectivity and also achieve the same approximation ratio. We also show that the 4-ratio is tight for our algorithms in both cases.",

        "abstract": "It is well-known that the application of directional antennas can help conserve bandwidth and energy consumption in wireless networks. Thus, to achieve efficiency in wireless networks, we study a special virtual backbone (VB) using directional antennas, requiring that from one node to any other node in the network, there exists at least one directional shortest path all of whose intermediate directions should belong to the VB, named as Minimum rOuting Cost Directional VB (MOC-DVB). In addition, VB has been well studied in Unit Disk Graph (UDG). However, radio wave based communications in wireless networks may be interrupted by obstacles (e.g., buildings and mountains). Thus, in this paper, we model a network as a general directed graph. We prove that construction of a minimum MOC-DVB is an NP-hard problem in a general directed graph and in term of the size of MOC-DVB, there exists an unreachable lower bound of the polynomial-time selected MOC-DVB. Therefore, we propose a distributed approximation algorithm for constructing MOC-DVB with approximation ratio of 1 + ln K + 2ln \u03b4D, where K is the number of antennas on each node and \u03b4D is the maximum direction degree in the network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our constructed MOC-DVB is much more efficient in the sense of MOC-DVB size and routing cost compared to other VBs.",

Thus, through switching off sectors in unnecessary directions in wireless networks, we can save bandwidth and energy consumption. In this paper, we will study a directional virtual backbone (VB) in the network where directional antennas are used. When constructing a VB, we will take routing and broadcasting into account since they are two common operations in wireless networks. Hence, we will study a VB with guaranteed routing costs, named \\alpha Minimum rOuting Cost Directional VB (\\alpha-MOC-DVB). Besides the properties of regular VBs, \\alpha-MOC-DVB also has a special constraint\u2014for any pair of nodes, there exists at least one path all intermediate directions on which must belong to \\alpha-MOC-DVB and the number of intermediate directions on the path is smaller than \\alpha times that on the shortest path. We prove that construction of a minimum \\alpha-MOC-DVB is an NP-hard problem in a general directed graph. A heuristic algorithm is proposed and theoretical analysis is also discussed in the paper.

Most prior literatures study mobile ad hoc wireless networks without considering existing physical infrastructure. By taking them into considerations, we propose a routing protocol in DTNs considering consecutive forwarding quality CFQ, and conduct extensive simulations with real trace data, so as to evaluate the performance of CFQ. Simulation results show that CFQ outperforms most existing pure probability based forwarding protocols and most existing pure centrality-community based forwarding protocols in that its delay time and replicas are significantly reduced and its delivery ratio is significantly increased. At last, we are able to conclude that CFQ is more buffer-efficient and time-efficient.",

While most map tasks are preemptive and parallelizable, the reduce tasks typically are not easily decomposed and often become a bottleneck due to constraints of data locality and task complexity. By assuming that reduce tasks are non-parallelizable, we study offline scheduling of minimizing makespan and minimizing total completion time, respectively. Both preemptive and non-preemptive reduce tasks are considered. On makespan minimization, for preemptive version we design an algorithm and prove its optimality, for non-preemptive version we design an approximation algorithm with the worst ratio of 3/2-1/2h where h is the number of machines. On total complete time minimization, for non-preemptive version we devise an approximation algorithm with worst case ratio of 2-1/h, and for preemptive version we devise a heuristic. We confirm that our algorithms outperform state-of-art schedulers through experiments.",

Universal means that the learning algorithm does not involve a priori assumption on the regularity of the target function. We characterize the complexity of the space of free multivariate splines by the remarkable notion called Rademacher complexity, based on which a penalized empirical risk is constructed as an estimation of the expected risk for the candidate model. Our Rademacher complexity bounds are tight within a logarithmic factor. It is shown that the prediction rule minimizing the penalized empirical risk achieves a favorable balance between the approximation and estimation error. By resorting to the powerful techniques in approximation theory to approach the approximation error, we also derive bounds on the generalization error in terms of the sample size, for a large class of loss functions.",

        "abstract": "The development of technology generates huge amounts of non-textual information, such as images. An efficient image annotation and retrieval system is highly desired. Clustering algorithms make it possible to represent visual features of images with finite symbols. Based on this, many statistical models, which analyze correspondence between visual features and words and discover hidden semantics, have been published. These models improve the annotation and retrieval of large image databases. However, image data usually have a large number of dimensions. Traditional clustering algorithms assign equal weights to these dimensions, and become confounded in the process of dealing with these dimensions. In this paper, we propose weighted feature selection algorithm as a solution to this problem. For a given cluster, we determine relevant features based on histogram analysis and assign greater weight to relevant features as compared to less relevant features. We have implemented four different models to link visual tokens with keywords based on the clustering results of K-means algorithm with weighted feature selection and without feature selection, and evaluated performance using precision, recall and correspondence accuracy using benchmark dataset. The results show that weighted feature selection is better than traditional ones for automatic image annotation and retrieval.",

We assign each sensor three parameters: the transmission range r, the interference range alpha r and the carrier sensing range beta r, where alpha, and beta are constants. lambda >= 1 channels are available for communication. We design a centralised algorithm with latency bound as (inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular +11inverted right perpendicular b/lambda right left perpendicular)R + (Delta - 23) inverted right perpendicular b/lambda inverted left perpendicular - inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular 12, where a and b are two integer constants derived from alpha and beta, Delta is the maximum degree of the network, and R is the latency's trivial lower bound. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio (inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular +11 inverted right perpendicular b/lambda inverted left perpendicular). When lambda = 1, the performance ratio is a + 11b, which improves the result in Zhu et al. (2009). We evaluate our algorithm's performance through extensive simulations.",

        "abstract": "Given a node-weighted graph, the minimum-weighted dominating set (MWDS) problem is to find a minimum-weighted vertex subset such that, for any vertex, it is contained in this subset or it has a neighbor contained in this set. And the minimum-weighted connected dominating set (MWCDS) problem is to find a MWDS such that the graph induced by this subset is connected. In this paper, we study these two problems on a unit disk graph. A (4 +\u0395)-approximation algorithm for an MWDS based on a dynamic programming algorithm for a Min-Weight Chromatic Disk Cover is presented. Meanwhile, we also propose a (1 +\u0395)-approximation algorithm for the connecting part by showing a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a Node-Weighted Steiner Tree problem when the given terminal set is c-local and thus obtain a (5 +\u0395)-approximation algorithm for an MWCDS. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

SCDS\u00a0plays an important role of the virtual backbone in asymmetric wireless networks.

        "abstract": "Viral marketing, the method of using a small set of users in social networks to propagate products through cascades, is a well-known and extreme research problem in recent years. Then, influence maximization (IM) is formulated, which aims to select the most influential seeds to maximize the expected total adoption eventually. IM expresses viral marketing perfectly. However, almost all prior work focused on cardinality constraint or considers only simple comparative products model. They neglected that composite complementary products (CCP) are widespread. In other words, when a customer adopts products \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$A$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$B$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n at the same time, it is possible for him to adopt product \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$C$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. Therefore, we design a multi-layer network model under independent cascade (IC) model to adapt to multiple complementary products and define the seed selection problem for complementary products model [IM for complementary products (IMCP)] and CCP model (IMCCP) under knapsack constraint. Here, the seed for different products has a different cost. In this paper, we propose two efficient techniques to solve IMCP problem, called Greedy and general-TIM. The Greedy uses simple Greedy Hill-Climbing algorithm under knapsack constraint and obtain \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$({1}/{2})(1-({1}/{e}))$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-approximation, but the time complexity is hard to accept. The second algorithm, general-TIM, forms a weighted set cover problem by means of randomized sampling (close to Greedy in practice), which reduces the time-consuming significantly. For IMCCP problem, it is difficult to handle because no ready-made algorithms exist to optimize a function that is nonsubmodular and nonsupermodular. Then, we need to get help from sandwich method by finding an upper and lower bound. Finally, our algorithms are evaluated on several real data sets, which prove the correctness of our algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we studied the minimum latency conflict-free many-to-one data aggregation scheduling problem in multi-channel multi-hop wireless sensor networks: Given locations of all sensors and a base station, some sensors which are called as sources, find a schedule such that data from all sources can be transmitted to the base station without any conflict and the latency is minimized. In this model, each sensor has three parameters which are transmission range r, interference range alpha r and carrier sensing range beta r where alpha, and beta are constant. There are lambda >= 1 available channels for communications. We designed an approximation algorithm with ratio (inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular + 11 inverted right perpendicular b/lambda inverted left perpendicular). This work improves our previous work [9] when lambda = 1. Extensive simulations evaluate the performance of the algorithm.",

Several polynomial-time approximation algorithms have been designed previously in the literature. Their best known performance ratio is O(r ln n) where r is the link radius of the sensor network and n is the number of sensors. In this paper, we will present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms. The first one is a random algorithm, with probability 1 - epsilon, producing an approximation solution with performance ratio O(log(3) n log log n), independent from r.

        "abstract": "This paper presents both the theoretical and practical aspects of secure group communication schemes. We pointed out that multiple revocation is a fundamentally time-consuming task in secure group communication, by establishing lower bounds for broadcast encryption and group key distribution schemes. We showed that they are O(n) for BE and O(n/m) for GKD respectively, where m is storage requirement and n is the number of users. Thus, they are clearly far more costly than the ideal log bound. In practice, we designed a new broadcast encryption scheme RBE that actually achieves these lower bounds. RBE is shown to outperform most efficient BE schemes in mass revocation. We discuss the influence of join as well as the feasibility of adding it in BE schemes by means of performing full updating or overprovisioning.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the backbone concept in wired networks, virtual backbone is expected to bring substantial benefits to routing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Virtual backbone construction based on Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is a competitive approach among the existing methods used to establish virtual backbone in WSNs. Traditionally, CDS size was the only factor considered in the CDS-based approach. The motivation was that smaller CDS leads to simplified network maintenance. However, routing cost in terms of routing path length is also an important factor for virtual backbone construction. In our research, both of these two factors are taken into account. Specifically, we attempt to devise a polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm that leads to a CDS with bounded CDS size and guaranteed routing cost. We prove that, under general graph model, there is no polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm unless (P) (=NP). Under Unit Disk Graph (UDG) model, we propose an innovative polynomial-time constant-approximation algorithm, GOC-MCDS-C, that produces a CDS (D) whose size |(D)| is within a constant factor from that of the minimum CDS. In addition, for each node pair (u) and (v), there exists a routing path with all intermediate nodes in (D) and path length at most (7 &middot d(u,v)), where (d(u,v)) is the length of the shortest path between (u) and (v). Our theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the distributed version of the proposed algorithm, GOC-MCDS-D, outperforms the existing approaches. \u00a9 1990-2012 IEEE.",

This survey provides an overview of popular fields (e.g., Viral marketing, influence propagation and social websites) for social network, moreover, introduces representative references, in which the well-known analytical methods and techniques (e.g., Graph theory, data mining techniques and analysis of social network) are briefly described.",

In this note, we show that this conjecture is not true for deterministic diffusion model and linear threshold (LT) model, that is, there exist polynomial-time algorithms for the influence maximization problem in those two models on arborescence directed into a root. This means that if the conjecture in the independent cascade (IC) model is true, then it would give an interesting difference between the IC model and the LT model.",

        "abstract": "Viral marketing has become one of the most effective marketing strategies. In the process of real commercialization, in order to let some seed individuals know the products, companies can provide free samples to them. However, for some companies, especially famous ones, they are more willing to offer coupons than give samples. In this paper, we consider the Profit Maximization problem with Coupons (PM-C) in our new diffusion model named the Independent Cascade Model with Coupons and Valuations (IC-CV). To solve this problem, we propose the PMCA algorithm which can return a ((frac{1}{3}-varepsilon ))-approximate solution with at least (1-2n^{-l}) probability, and runs in (O(log (np)cdot m n^3log n(llog n +nlog 2)/varepsilon ^3)) expected time. Further more, during the analysis we provide a method to estimate the non-monotone submodular function.",

        "abstract": "Hosts in wireless networks are usually powered by batteries, thus the lifetime of a network depends on the battery life of each individual host. One major solution to improve energy-efficiency is to minimize the total energy consumption. However, battery energy is a local resource, to save energy at each host and balance the energy consumption among all the hosts in the network appear to be more practical. In this paper, we prove that minimum weight incremental arborescence (MWIA) is the optimal solution for minimizing the maximum transmission power among a set of wireless nodes. We propose an algorithm that utilizes MWIA to construct a connected topology, called MWIA-based Topology Control(MWIA-TC) algorithm. We further apply MWIA-TC to the accumulated energy consumption. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that MWIA-TC outperforms a well-known algorithm, Minimum Incremental Power (MIP), in both energy saving and network lifetime extension.",

        "abstract": "Modeling spatial context (e.g., autocorrelation) is a key challenge in classification problems that arise in geospatial domains. Markov random fields (MRF) is a popular model for incorporating spatial context into image segmentation and land-use classification problems. The spatial autoregression (SAR) model, which is an extension of the classical regression model for incorporating spatial dependence, is popular for prediction and classification of spatial data in regional economics, natural resources, and ecological studies. There is little literature comparing these alternative approaches to facilitate the exchange of ideas. We argue that the SAR model makes more restrictive assumptions about the distribution of feature values and class boundaries than MRF. The relationship between SAR and MRF is analogous to the relationship between regression and Bayesian classifiers. This paper provides comparisons between the two models using a probabilistic and an experimental framework.",

Optimal placements of data replicas have been studied extensively in the literature for various protocol. In this paper, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for optimality of a placement of odd number of data replicas in a ring network with majority voting protocol. As a corollary, we give a proof of a recent conjecture of Hu et al. (manuscript, 1999 ). Moreover, we also give a simple algorithm to find optimal placements in tree network with majority voting protocol.",

With majority voting protocol, a location is survived for read/write operations if and only if it is accessible to more than half of the replicas. The problem is to find out the optimal placements for a given number of data replicas in a ring network. When the number of replicas is odd, it was conjectured by Hu et al. that every uniform placement is optimal, which is proved by Shekhar and Wu later. However, when the number of replicas is even, it was pointed out by Hu et al. that uniform placements are not optimal and the optimal placement problem may be very complicated. In this paper, we study the optimal placement problem in a ring network with majority voting protocol and even number of replicas, and give a complete characterization of optimal placements when the number of replicas is not too large compared with the number of locations.",

        "abstract": "Data compression is an effective technique to improve the performance of data warehouses. Since cube operation represents the core of online analytical processing in data warehouses, it is a major challenge to develop efficient algorithms for computing cube on compressed data warehouses. To our knowledge, very few cube computation techniques have been proposed for compressed data warehouses to date in the literature. This paper presents a novel algorithm to compute cubes on compressed data warehouses. The algorithm operates directly on compressed data sets without the need of first decompressing them. The algorithm is applicable to a large class of mapping complete data compression methods. The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed in detail. The analytical and experimental results show that the algorithm is more efficient than all other existing cube algorithms. In addition, a heuristic algorithm to generate an optimal plan for computing cube is also proposed.",

Typical applications include the detection of the transportation front line of some vegetation or animalcule's growth over a certain geographical region. We propose and analyze two novel algorithms for outlying sensor identification and event boundary detection. These algorithms are purely localized and, thus, scale well to large sensor networks. Their computational overhead is low, since only simple numerical operations are involved. Simulation results indicate that these algorithms can clearly detect the event boundary and can identify outlying sensors with a high accuracy and a low false alarm rate when as many as 20 percent sensors report outlying readings. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithms can accept any kind of scalar values as inputs\u00c2\u00bfa dramatic improvement over existing work, which takes only 0/1 decision predicates. Therefore, our algorithms are generic. They can be applied as long as \"events\u00c2\u00bf can be modeled by numerical numbers. Though designed for sensor networks, our algorithms can be applied to the outlier detection and regional data analysis in spatial data mining.",

The purpose of this study is to use the online platform of blogs to explore whether the framing effect of information content, situated learning of information content, and health knowledge involvement would affect health communication between doctors and patients and further explore whether this would increase patient willingness to seek treatment.This study uses a survey to collect data from patient subjects who have used online doctor blogs or patients who have discussed medical information with doctors on blogs. The number of valid questionnaire samples is 278, and partial least square is used to conduct structural equation model analysis.Research results show that situated learning and health knowledge involvement have a positive effect on health communication. The negative framing effect and health knowledge involvement would also affect the patient's intention to seek medical help. In addition, situated learning and health knowledge involvement would affect the intention to seek medical help through communication factors.Blogs are important communication channels between medical personnel and patients that allow users to consult and ask questions without time limitations and enable them to obtain comprehensive health information.",

        "abstract": "Emotions play an important role in human behavior. Negative emotions resulting from medical disputes are problems for medical personnel to solve but also have a significant impact on a hospital's reputation and people's trust in the hospital. One medical dispute case was chosen from an Internet news source to assess the correlation between people's negative emotions and negative online word-of-mouth. Convenience sampling was used in school faculties and university students who had shared their medical treatment experiences online were the research participants. A total of 221 Taiwanese participants volunteered (158 women, 63 men; ages: 26.7% under 19, 22.6% 20-29, 30.8% 30-39,19.9% over 40). Four negative emotions were measured using rating scales: uncertainty, anger, disappointment, and sadness. Four negative online word-of-mouth measures were: venting, advice search, helping receiver, and revenge. A modeled relationship was assessed by partial least square method (PLS). Then, people's positive emotions were further analyzed to assess changes after spreading negative word-of-mouth. The results showed that uncertainty had a positive effect on venting and advice search. People who felt anger or regret spread word-of-mouth in order to help the receiver. Disappointment may trigger the revenge behavior of negative word-of-mouth. Negative emotions could be relieved after engaging in the behavior of helping the receiver.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Biogas, which primarily consists of methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), is a renewable energy carrier, and can be upgraded to a natural gas substitute after removing trace impurities and CO 2 . Among the various CO 2  separation technologies, amine absorption is generally considered to be energy intensive as regenerating the rich solution need additional heat to strip CO 2 . However, it could hardly be found the related data concerning energy consumption of biogas upgrading projects adopting amine absorption. In this work, a pilot biogas upgrading project with combined amine absorption unit and gas steam boiler was established with treatment capacity of 300 Nm 3 /h feed biogas. The major energy for operating this biogas upgrading project was self-provided through combustion a fraction of the biogas to generate steam for regenerating rich absorbent. Operation results showed that, besides much higher CO 2  removal efficiency (u003e99.5%), CH 4  recovery of this project attained around 89.0%, which was higher than that of several biogas upgrading projects using one-stage PSA or two-stage membrane permeation technologies. Based on the results of this work, it proves that amine absorption is a highly effective technique for CO 2  removal in biogas upgrading projects, and its energy consumption is not higher than other technologies.",

This catalytic equipment has shown excellent deoxygenation performance. The catalytic oxidation reaction could be completely lit off in half an hour, and the full light-off temperature in the center of the catalytic bed was generally less than 300 \u00b0C. Complete deoxygenation was achieved once the reaction was lit off during the entire running period. The deoxygenation performance was not affected by the fluctuation of operating conditions such as gas flow rate and inlet oxygen content. The catalyst also showed satisfactory durability.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dehydration is the first chemical reaction in biomass pyrolysis. The process of dehydration has great influence on the subsequent chemical reactions and product distribution. There is little research on dehydration characteristics of real biomass during pyrolysis. Therefore, in this study the dehydration characteristics were investigated using rice husk as the biomass representative in the pyrolysis experiments. On this basis, NiO/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3 , was used as the catalyst for rice husk pyrolysis to study its catalytic mechanism for the dehydration reaction of biomass. Results of the pyrolysis experiments indicated that dehydration reaction mainly occurred in the temperature range of 250\u2013350\u202f\u00b0C, in which the mass of water produced was around 5.92% of the dry raw material. Through comparing the dehydration curve with thermogravimetric (TG) curve of rice husk, it was found that the dehydration was one of the primary reactions during the pyrolysis, and the accumulated water produced attained to 33.82\u202fwt% of total volatile products of the pyrolysis at 400\u202f\u00b0C. When catalyst NiO/\u03b3-Al 2 O 3  was used with NiO loading in the range of 5\u201320%, the production of water increased by 0.88\u20131.04 times at 350\u202f\u00b0C under the pyrolysis condition in this study. The results of catalytic pyrolysis showed that \u03b3-Al 2 O 3  was the major active component for catalyzing the dehydration reactions. Through characterization of the catalysts by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it was found that the weak acid sites on \u03b3-Al 2 O 3  surface played the most important role in the catalytic dehydration reactions.",

        "abstract": "Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) often presents as multifocal tumor;, however, whether multifocality is associated with poor prognosis remains controversial. The aims of this retrospective study were to identify the characteristics of PTC with multifocal tumors and evaluate the association between the location and prognosis. We reviewed the medical records of 496 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for PTC. Patients were classified as three groups: N1 (solitary tumor), N2 (2 or more foci within unilateral lobe of thyroid), and N3 (bilateral tumors, at least one tumor focus for each lobe of thyroid). We analyzed the differences of clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes among the three groups. Cox regression model was used to assess the relation between the different locations of multifocal tumors and prognosis. Although the differences of clinicopathologic features such as the size of tumor, extrathyroidal extension, and cervical lymph node metastasis were not significant among the three groups, the bilateral-multifocality was proved to be an independent risk factor for neck recurrence (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20094.052, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 2.070\u20137.933), distant metastasis (HR\u2009=\u20093.860, 95\u00a0% CI 1.507\u20139.884), and cancer death (HR\u2009=\u20097.252, 95\u00a0% 2.189\u201324.025). In addition, extrathyroidal extension (HR\u2009=\u20092.291, 95\u00a0% CI 1.185\u20134.427) and older age >45\u00a0years (HR\u2009=\u20096.721, 95\u00a0% CI 2.300\u201319.637) were also significant predictors for neck recurrence and cancer death, respectively. Therefore, bilateral-multifocality as an indicator for more extensive tumor location could be used to assess the risk of recurrence and mortality in PTC. Given the poor prognosis associated with bilateral-multifocality and other risk factors, aggressive therapy and intensive follow-up were recommended for PTC patients with them.",

        "abstract": "The role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in the aggressiveness of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains to be further investigated. Here we examined the relationship of TERT promoter mutations and BRAF V600E with the clinicopathological features of PTC in 653 patients. Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA from primary PTC tumors was performed for mutation detection and genotype-clinicopathological correlation of the tumor was analyzed. BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations were found in 63.7% (416 of 653) and 4.1% (27 of 653) of patients, respectively; the latter became 9.8% when only tumors \u2265 1.5 cm were analyzed. TERT promoter mutations occurred more frequently in BRAF mutation-positive cases compared to wild-type cases, being 5.3% in the former versus 2.1% in the latter (P = 0.050). BRAF and TERT promoter mutations were each significantly associated with high-risk clinicopathological features of PTC, such as old patient age, large tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, capsular invasion, and advanced disease stages. Coexistence of BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations was particularly associated with high-risk clinicopathological features, as exemplified by extrathyroidal invasion seen in 54.5% (12/22) of patients harboring both mutations versus 9.9% (23/232) of patients harboring neither mutation (P u003c 0.001). Thus, this study, the largest on TERT mutation so far, demonstrates a significant role of BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations in the aggressiveness of PTC, which is particularly robust and cooperative when the two mutations coexist. These results, together with previous studies, establish a significant role of these mutations in the aggressiveness of PTC.",
