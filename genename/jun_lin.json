X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), TEM, photoluminescence (PL), low voltage cathodoluminescence (CL), and time-resolved PL spectra and lifetimes are used to characterize these materials. The XRD results indicate that X1-Y2SiO5 layers have been successfully coated on the surface of SiO2 particles, as further verified by the FESEM and TEM images. The PL and CL studies suggest that SiO2@Y2SiO5:Eu3+, SiO 2@Y2SiO5:Tb3+ (or Ce 3+/Tb3+), and SiO2@Y2SiO 5:Ce3+ core/shell particles exhibit red (Eu3+, 613 nm: 5D0-7F2), green (Tb 3+, 542 nm: 5D4-7F5), or blue (Ce3+, 450 nm: 5d-4f) luminescence, respectively.

        "abstract": "Nanocrystalline GdPO 4 : Eu 3+ phosphor layers were coated on non-aggregated, monodisperse and spherical SiO 2 particles by Pechini sol-gel method, resulting in the formation of core-shell structured SiO 2@GdPO 4 : Eu 3+ particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), low-voltage cathodoluminescence (CL), time-resolved PL spectra and lifetimes were used to characterize the core-shell structured materials. Both XRD and FT-IR results indicate that GdPO 4 layers have been successfully coated on the SiO 2 particles, which can be further verified by the images of FESEM and TEM. Under UV light excitation, the SiO 2@GdPO 4 : Eu 3+ phosphors show orange-red luminescence with Eu 3+ 5D 0- 7F 1 (593 nm) as the most prominent group. The PL excitation and emission spectra suggest that an energy transfer occurs from Gd 3+ to Eu 3+ in SiO 2@GdPO 4:Eu 3+ phosphors. The obtained core-shell phosphors have potential applications in FED and PDP devices. Copyright \u00a9 2007 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Uniform, ultra-small-sized and well-water-dispersible LaF 3 nanoparticles doped with trivalent rare earth (RE) ions (Eu 3+ or Tb 3+) have been synthesized by a simple, low temperature synthesis route. The nanoparticles, with sizes of about 3.2 nm (for those doped with Eu 3+) and 3.0 nm (for those doped with Tb 3+), are roughly spherical and monodisperse. 1,2,4,5-Benzenetetracarboxylic acid (labeled as BA) as sensitizer has been bonded to the surface of the nanoparticles, which can sensitize the emission of RE 3+ in the LaF 3 nanoparticles. The BA-LaF 3:RE 3+ (RE = Eu or Tb) nanoparticles have a broad absorption band in the UV domain, and show enhanced luminescence of RE 3+ based on an energy transfer from BA ligands to RE 3+ ions (i.e. the so-called \"antenna effect\"). Due to the dual protection of organic ligands (BA) and inorganic matrices (LaF 3), BA-LaF 3:RE 3+ (RE = Eu or Tb) nanoparticles have longer excited state lifetimes than LaF 3:RE 3+ (RE = Eu or Tb) nanoparticles as well as lanthanide coordination polymers of BA.

        "abstract": "Y2O3:Eu3+ phosphor layers were deposited on monodisperse SiO2 particles with different sizes (300, 500, 900, and 1200 nm) via a sol-gel process, resulting in the formation of Y 2O3:Eu3+@SiO2 core-shell particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and lifetimes were employed to characterize the Y2O3:Eu3+@SiO 2 core-shell samples. The results of XRD indicated that the Y 2O3:Eu3+ layers began to crystallize on the silica surfaces at 600 \u00b0C and the crystallinity increased with the elevation of annealing temperature until 900 \u00b0C. The obtained core-shell particles have perfect spherical shape with narrow size distribution and non-agglomeration. The thickness of the shells could be easily controlled by changing the number of deposition cycles (60 nm for three deposition cycles). Under the excitation of ultraviolet (250 nm), the Eu3+ ion mainly shows its characteristic red (611 nm, 5D0- 7F2) emissions in the core-shell particles from Y 2O3:Eu3+ shells. The emission intensity Eu 3+ can be tuned by the annealing temperature, SiO2 core size, the number of coating cycles, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration in the precursor solution, respectively. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as kinetic decays were employed to characterize the samples. The SEM and the TEM images show that the hexagonal structured lanthanide orthophosphate LnPO4 (Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd) products have nanorod bundles morphology, while the tetragonal LnPO4 (Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho) samples prepared under the same experimental conditions are composed of nanoparticles. HRTEM micrographs and SAED results prove that these nanostructures are polycrystalline in nature. The possible formation mechanism for LnPO4 (Ln=La-Gd) nanorod bundles is proposed. Eu3+-doped LaPO4 and Tb3+-doped CePO4 samples were also prepared by using the same synthetic process, which exhibit an orange-red (Eu3+:5D0-7F1, 2, 3, 4) and green (Tb3+, 5D4-7F3, 4, 5, 6) emission, respectively. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The FE-SEM images illustrate that CaWO 4 and CaWO 4 : Pb 2+ and CaWO 4 : Tb 3+ powders are composed of spherical particles with sizes around 260, 290, and 190 nm respectively, which are the aggregates of smaller nanoparticles around 10-20 nm.

A plausible growth mechanism for developing each type of lead chalcogenide nanocubes is proposed. These delicately designed PbSeTe nanoscale architectures offer tunable compositions in PbSeTe ternary alloy and nano-interfaces in core/shell nanocubes, which are the critical factors in controlling thermal conductivity for applications in thermoelectrics.",

The average size of nanocrystals can be tuned using a dynamic injection technique. TEM and XRD investigations indicate that each nanocrystal is a single crystal. The optical determination implies that the photoluminescence behavior of these In2O3 nanocrystals is different from that of the bulk, probably due to the combination of weak quantum-confinement-effects and the nature of high crystallinity in nanocrystals.",

The resulted SiO2@Gd0.95Eu0.05VO4 core-shell particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, low voltage cathodoluminescence (CL), time resolved PL spectra and kinetic decays. The XRD results demonstrate that the Gd0.95Eu0.05VO4 layers begin to crystallize on the SiO2 spheres after annealing at 600 \u00b0C and the crystallinity increases with raising the annealing temperature. The obtained core-shell phosphors have spherical shape, narrow size distribution (average size ca. 600 nm), non-agglomeration. The thickness of the Gd0.95Eu0.05VO4 shells on the SiO2 cores could be easily tailored by varying the number of deposition cycles (50 nm for four deposition cycles). PL and CL show that the emissions are dominated by 5D0-7F2 transition of Eu3+ (618 nm, red). The PL and CL intensities of Eu3+ increase with increasing the annealing temperature and the number of coating cycles.

The morphologies of Bi2S3 crystals are highly dependent on the experimental parameters, including the reaction temperature, reactant ratio, sulfur source, and additive. The adjustment of these parameters can lead to an obvious shape evolution of products, and the growth mechanism has been proposed. The results reveal that excess S source is favorable for the formation of high-quality Bi2S3 nanostructures; the dimensions of Bi2S3 are highly dependent on the nature of S source materials; the employment of additives in the reaction process results in the appearance of flower-like Bi2S3 microstructures.

The results of XRD indicate that the as-prepared nanoparticles are well-crystallized at 160\u00b0C and assigned to the monoclinic monazite structure of the LaPO 4 phase. The obtained LaPO 4:Ce 3+, Tb 3+ nanoparticles are spherical with narrow size distribution and average size of 20 nm.

        "abstract": "One-dimensional Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers have been prepared by a combination method of sol\u2013gel process and electrospinning. The as-formed precursor samples present uniform fiberlike morphology. After annealing the precursors at 900 \u00b0C, the Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers are uniform with diameters ranging from 90 to 180 nm. Under ultraviolet excitation and the low-voltage electron beam excitation, Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers all exhibit typical red (612 nm) emission corresponding to 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition of Eu 3+ . Abstract One-dimensional Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers have been prepared by a combination method of sol\u2013gel process and electrospinning technology. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG\u2013DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were used to characterize the samples. The XRD, FT-IR and TG\u2013DTA results show that Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ samples crystallize at 900 \u00b0C.

After being heated at 900 \u00b0C, the diameters of fibers decrease greatly, ranging from 90 to 180 nm. TEM image further manifests that the as-formed Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers consist of nanoparticles (the crystallite size is about 16.5 nm). Under the short wavelength ultraviolet irradiation and the low-voltage electron beam excitation, Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers all exhibit typical red ( 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F J ) emission. The optimum doping concentration of Eu 3+ in the Lu 2 O 3 nanofibers also has been investigated. Keywords Electrospinning Lu 2 O 3 Europium Luminescence Nanofibers 1 Introduction Generally many important properties of nanomaterials depend not only on the particle size but also on their morphology and structure. One-dimensional (1D) structured metal oxides, such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods, nanotubes (NTs), and nanobelts, exhibit novel physical and chemical properties due to their unique and fascinating characteristics for huge ratio of diameter to length, superior mechanical toughness, and so on [1\u20136] . It can be used in optical, data-storage devices and nanoelectronic devices [7\u20139] . Many methods have been used to prepare one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, including chemical or physical vapor deposition [10\u201313] , laser ablation [10,14] , solution [15] , arc discharge [16,17] , vapor-phase transport process [18\u201320] , and a template-based method [21\u201323] . Compared to these, electrospinning is a more simple and cost-effective approach. Electrospinning technology has been used since 1930s to prepare one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials [24] . It is a process that uses the strong electrostatic force by a high static voltage applied to a polymer solution placed into a container with a millimeter diameter nozzle. Under the applied electrical force, the polymer solution is ejected from the nozzle. After the solvents are evaporated during the course of jet spraying, the hybrid samples are collected on a grounded collector. Organic, inorganic and hybrid (organic\u2013inorganic) compounds all can be electrospun to form uniform fibers [25\u201328] . Sol\u2013gel techniques can be employed to prepare precursor solution, which has been proved as an efficient way to produce nanoparticles [29] . (1D) nanomaterials fabricated by a combination method of sol\u2013gel process and electrospinning have become important for exceptional length, uniform diameter, diverse composition, and high surface. Rare earth oxides have been extensively used in high performance luminescent devices, magnets, catalysts, and other functional materials because of their electronic, optical, and chemical characteristics arising from the 4f electronic [30\u201334] , and most of these functions depend strongly on the composition and structure of materials. Recently, Lu 2 O 3 has been recognized one of the promising host lattices for application in X-ray imagery because of its high density (9.4 g/cm 3 ), high atomic number of Lu ( Z = 71), and high physical and chemical stability. Furthermore, because the Lu 2 O 3 has a much higher density (9.4 g/cm 3 ) than Y 2 O 3 (5.01 g/cm 3 ), Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ may have more advantage in FED application because it can resist the bombardment of electron beam more effectively than Y 2 O 3 . Lu 2 O 3 activated with Eu 3+ is considered to be an interesting X-ray phosphor, which may serve as efficient X-ray detector in digital planar X-ray medical imaging, with an X-ray absorptivity unsurpassed among current scintillator materials, a light output comparable to CsI:TI, and an emission wavelength much better matched to the spectral sensitivity of typical CCD arrays [35,36] . To further reduce the images blurring by reducing the scattering of light within the phosphor layer, more attention has been paid to the Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanomaterials. Therefore, it is very important to synthesize Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanomaterials in both fundamental research and practical applications. To our knowledge, many methods have been mentioned in literature to prepare Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanomaterials [37\u201340] , but the electrospinning preparation has not been reported. So in this paper, we prepared the Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers by a combination menthod of sol\u2013gel process and electrospinning technology, and investigated the morphology, structure, photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence properties. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Lu 2 O 3 and Eu 2 O 3 (99.99%) were purchased from Science and Technology Parent Company of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry. Nitric acid HNO 3 (AR), citric acid monohydrate C 6 H 8 O 7 \u22c5H 2 O (\u2a7e9.5%, AR) and ethanol were all purchased from Beijing Fine Chemical Company. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, M w = 1,300,000) was purchased from Aldrich. All the initial chemicals were used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ Lu 2(1\u2212 x ) O 3 :2 x Eu 3+ ( x = 0\u20138 mol%) nanofibers were prepared by a method of sol \u2013gel process and electrospinning. First, the stoichiometric amounts of Lu 2 O 3 and Eu 2 O 3 were dissolved in dilute nitric acid under heating, and then were mixed with water\u2013ethanol (v/v = 3:7) solution containing a suitable amount of citric acid (the molar ratio of metal ions to citric acid is 1:2) as a chelating agent for metal ions. Then an appropriate amount of PVP (the weight percentage of PVP is 8% in the water\u2013ethanol solution) were added into above solution to obtain the viscous solution for electrospinning. Then the precursor solution was stirred for 4 h to form a transparent solution for electrospinning. A typical electrospinning setup was composed of a syringe, a high-voltage power supply, a flat tip needle, and a grounded collector. The transparent precursor solution was placed into a syringe with a flat tip needle. The anode from a high-voltage power was connected with the syringe needle flat tip. The cathode was linked to the grounded collector, and the distance between needle and collector was fixed at 16 cm. The high-voltage power supply was maintained at 10 kV, and the flow rate of spinning solution was controlled at 0.5 ml/h by a syringe pump (TJ-3A/W0109-1B, Boading Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd., China). In this way, the precursor fibers were prepared. Finally, the precursor fibers were annealed at 600, 800 and 900 \u00b0C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 \u00b0C/min respectively to remove the organic species and to form the final Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ fibers. 2.3 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Rigaku-Dmax 2500 diffractometer using Cu K a radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15405 nm). FT-IR spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 580B infrared spectrophotometer with the KBr pellet technique. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG\u2013DTA) data were recorded with a Thermal Analysis instrument (SDT 2960, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) with the heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 in an air flow of 100 mL min \u22121 . The morphology and structure of the samples were inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, XL30, Philips) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS, JEOL JXA-840). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs were obtained from a FEI Tecnai G 2 S-Twin transmission electron microscope with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The cathodoluminescent (CL) measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (<10 \u22128 Torr), where the samples were excited by an electron beam at a voltage range of 3\u20135 kV with different filament currents, and the emission spectra were recorded using an F-4500 spectrophotometer. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation process, structure and morphology XRD patterns of the as prepared precursor fibers for Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ and those were calcined at different temperatures (range from 600 \u00b0C to 900 \u00b0C) as well as the standard card of Lu 2 O 3 (JCPDS No. 65-3172) are shown respectively in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 1 b for the as prepared precursor samples, there is a broad band at 2 \u03b8 = 22\u00b0. In order to make clear what this broad band is assigned to, we measured the XRD patterns of pure PVP as shown in Fig. 1 a. From XRD patterns in Fig. 1 a and b, we can confirm that the broad band at 2 \u03b8 = 22\u00b0 is ascribed to the semicrystalline PVP in precursor fibers. When precursor samples were annealed at 600 \u00b0C (in Fig. 2 c), well-defined diffraction peaks appeared, and all the diffraction peaks can be well-assigned to the standard card of Lu 2 O 3 . This manifests that the precursor samples have crystallized at this temperature. No other phase peaks are observed, indicating that the Eu 3+ ions have been effectively built into the Lu 2 O 3 host lattice. When the heating temperature reached 800 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C (in Fig. 2 d and e), all the diffraction peaks increase in intensity because of the increasing of crystallinity. The diffraction peaks of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers are shifted a little to lower angles with respect to the position of the standard card of Lu 2 O 3 (JCPDS No. 65-3172) pattern. This is because the Eu 3+ ion is bigger than the Lu 3+ ion in the Lu 2 O 3 host lattice [ R (Lu 3+ ) = 0.0848 nm and R (Eu 3+ ) = 0.0950 nm]. However, the shift is very small due to the low doping concentration of Eu 3+ . The lattice constant of the calcined product was calculated according to this equation (1) 1 / d 2 = ( h 2 + k 2 + l 2 ) / a 2 where d is the interplanar distance, h , k , l are the crystal indices (Miller indices), and a is the lattice constant. On the basis of the (2 2 2) crystal planes ( d = 0.300 nm in Fig. 5 b) the lattice constant is a = 1.0392 nm, which is well compatible with the literature value of a = 1.0391 nm (JCPDS: 65-3172). The FT-IR spectra of the as prepared precursor fibers for Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ and those heat-treated at 900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 2 . Some vibration bands of the OH group (3418 cm \u22121 ), CH 2 group (2956, 1468 and 1424 cm \u22121 ), C O group (1642 cm \u22121 ), carbonates COO \u2212 group (1384 cm \u22121 ), and tertiary amine group (1293 cm \u22121 ) are detected in Fig. 2 a, which come from precursor fibers (ethanol, citric acid, and PVP) [41\u201343] . After the precursor fibers were calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 3 h ( Fig. 2 b), the absorption peaks of vibration bands from precursor fibers disappear completely, and two new absorption bands are presented. The peaks centered at 548 cm \u22121 and 492 cm \u22121 are assigned to the Lu O bending vibrations of the cubic Lu 2 O 3 [44] , These indicate that crystalline-phase Lu 2 O 3 has formed after annealing at 900 \u00b0C, agreeing well with the results of XRD. TG\u2013DTA curves of the as prepared precursor fibers are shown in Fig. 3 . TG curve display three stages of weight loss. The weight loss (20%) of first stage (40\u2013190 \u00b0C) come from evaporation of water and alcohol. The second stage (190\u2013350 \u00b0C) weight loss accompanied by two exothermic peak at 200 \u00b0C and 339 \u00b0C in the DTA curve is 55%, which can be attributed to the decomposition of organic groups (PVP, citric acid, and the citrates) [45,46] . Two exothermic peaks at 390 \u00b0C and 460 \u00b0C in the DTA curve are correspond with the third stage weight loss (10%) from 300 to 500 \u00b0C, which is caused by the further combustion of residual organic compounds. When the temperature reached above 500 \u00b0C, there was no change in weight loss, indicating the formation of pure inorganic oxide. The morphologies and structure of samples were investigated by the SEM and TEM observations. The SEM images of as prepared precursor fibers and those were heated at 900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4 a and b are for low-magnification and high-magnification SEM images of the precursor fibers, respectively. From these images, it can be seen that the surface of the as prepared precursor fibers is smooth with diameters range from 250 to 480 nm. After being calcined at 900 \u00b0C for 3 h ( Fig. 4 c and d), the precursor fibers were converted to Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ samples. The fiber diameters decrease greatly due to the decomposition of the organic species and the formation of inorganic phase (inorganic stuff also contract during the calcination process), the diameters become 90\u2013180 nm. The EDS spectra ( Fig. 4 e) shows the presence of O, Lu and Eu (Au from the coating for SEM measurement), which further indicates the formation of Lu 2 O 3 (containing Eu) in the fibers. TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers are shown in Fig. 5 a and b. From Fig. 5 a, it can be observed that the nanofibers are composed of fine and closely linked nanoparticles. Typical HRTEM image ( Fig. 5 b) of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers shows well-resolved lattice fringes. The distance between the adjacent lattice fringes is 0.300 nm, it corresponds to the interplanar spacing of Lu 2 O 3 (2 2 2) planes. The result further confirms the formation of crystalline Lu 2 O 3 in nanofibers after thermal treatment, agreeing well with the XRD results. In fact, in order to obtain fibers with uniform morphology, we must prepare a solution with a viscoelastic behavior similar to that of a conventional polymer solution, which is suitable for electrospinning. In our experiments, it is very important to control the volume ratio of water to alcohol and the weight percentage of PVP for the appropriate solution can be further electrospinning. At the same time, the morphology and diameter of the electrospun samples are also dependent on several process parameters, including the intrinsic properties of the solution and the operational conditions. Therefore, the key of this experiment is searching for a balance point of various electrospinning parameters. The balance point might be related to the volume ratio of water to alcohol, the weight percentage of PVP, the spinning rate, the strength of the electric field, and the distance between the spinneret and the collector. In our experiments, we searched the optimal ratio by changing the ratio of water and alcohol under same PVP content. From the SEM images ( Fig. 6 ) of Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ fiberlike samples obtained by adjusting water/alcohol ratio (a \u2013 3:7, b \u2013 3:9, c \u2013 3:11), it can be seen that the yield and morphology of samples vary. Additionally, when the water/alcohol ratio reaches or exceeds 3:5, no samples can be obtained by the electrospinning process. 3.2 Luminescence properties Fig. 7 exhibit (a) excitation and (b) emission spectrum of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers. The excitation spectra was obtained by monitoring the emission of the Eu 3+ transition at 612 nm, which ranging from 200 to 450 nm with two peaks at 216 and 237 nm. The intense peak at 216 nm can also be detected for pure Lu 2 O 3 in the diffuse reflection spectrum [47] . Obviously, it is due to the host absorption of Lu 2 O 3 [48] . The other band at 237 nm ascribes to Eu 3+ \u2013O 2\u2212 charge transfer band (CTB) [48] . The appearance of this band implies that there is an energy transfer from host lattice to Eu 3+ ions as observed previously for Y 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ [49] . The emission spectrum was obtained under short-wavelength UV irradiation when excited by a 237 nm irradiation. All the spectra show typical emissions of Eu 3+ ions in cubic Lu 2 O 3 , which corresponds to 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F J transitions ( J = 0\u20134). The most intense peak at 612 nm assigns to 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition. From the photoluminescence spectrum, it can be seen that nanofibers of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ show strong red light emission under a 237 nm UV light irradiation. The dependence of the PL emission intensity on its doping concentration ( x ) in Lu 2(1\u2212 x ) O 3 :2 x mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers was shown in Fig. 8 . By varying the content of the Eu 3+ in the Lu 2 O 3 nanofibers, we determined the compositions with the highest PL emission intensity. From the Figure, it can been found that the PL emission intensity of Eu 3+ increase with the increase of its concentration ( x ) first, reaching a maximum value with the Eu 3+ concentration of 6 mol%, and then decrease with the increasing Eu 3+ concentration ( x ) due to the concentration quenching effect. Thus, the optimum concentration for Eu 3+ red emission is 6 mol% of Eu 3+ in Lu 2 O 3 nanofiber phosphors. The average distances ( R ) between Eu 3+ ions can be estimated in terms of the equation R = 2(3 V /4\u03c0 XN ) 1/3 (where V is the volume of the unit cell, X is the concentration, and N is the number of available crystallographic sites occupied by the activator ions in the unit cell) [50] . The corresponding R (Eu 3+ \u2013Eu 3+ ) values for Lu 2(1\u2212 x ) O 3 :2 x mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers are calculated (the related crystal parameters V = 1.124 nm 3 , Z = 16, and N = Z \u00d7 2 = 32). The average distances ( R ) between Eu 3+ ions is 1.038 nm when the doping concentration reaches 6 mol%. The CL spectra properties of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers were further investigated. The representative CL spectra of Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers is shown in Fig. 9 a, which has identical shape as the PL emission spectra. Thus, under the low-voltage electron beam excitation, the Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers also show red light emission. The CL emission intensity for Lu 2 O 3 :6 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers has been investigated as a function of the filament current and accelerating voltage, as show in Fig. 9 b and c. When the filament current is fixed at 105 mA, the CL intensity increases with increasing the accelerating voltage from 3.0 to 5.0 kV. Similarly, when the accelerating voltage is maintained at 5 kV, the CL intensity increases with raising the filament current from 97 to 105 mA. The increase in CL brightness with an increase in electron energy and filament current are attributed to the deeper penetration of the electrons into the phosphors and the larger electron beam current density. The electron penetration depth can be estimated using the empirical formula L [\u00c5] = 250( A / \u03c1 )( E / Z 1/2 ) n , where n = 1.2/(1\u20130.29 log Z ), A is the atomic or molecular weight of the material, \u03c1 is the bulk density, Z is the atomic number or the number of electrons per molecule in the case compounds, and E is the accelerating voltage (kV) [51] . For cathodoluminescence, the Eu 3+ ions are excited by the plasmons produced by the incident electrons. The deeper the electron penetration depth, the more plasma will be produced, which results in more Eu 3+ ions being excited and thus the CL intensity increases. 4 Summary In summary, one-dimensional Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers were successfully prepared by electrospinning technique in conjunction with sol\u2013gel process. As prepared precursor samples present uniform fiberlike morphology and smooth surface with diameters ranging from 250 to 480 nm. After precursor annealed at 900 \u00b0C for 3 h, the as-formed samples are well-crystallized and still maintain their fiberlike morphology, except for the decreasing diameters. These as-formed Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers consist of linked nanoparticles with the diameters ranging from 90 to 180 nm. Under the short wavelength ultraviolet irradiation and the low-voltage electron beam excitation, Lu 2 O 3 :Eu 3+ nanofibers all exhibit typical red (Eu 3+ , 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F J ) emission. The CL intensity increases with increasing accelerating voltage and filament current. The optimum doping concentration of Eu 3+ in the Lu 2 O 3 nanofibers is 6 mol%. Electrospinning technique is facile and low cost method for prepare 1D luminescent nanomaterials, it can be used to develop more other 1D luminescent nanomaterials.

        "abstract": "One-dimensional GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers have been prepared by a combination method of sol\u2013gel process and electrospinning technology. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), quantum efficiency (QE), and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the samples. The XRD, FT-IR, and TG-DTA results show that GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ nanofibers samples crystallize at 700 \u00b0C. SEM images indicate that the as prepared precursor fibers are smooth. After being calcined at 700 \u00b0C for 4 h, the fibers still maintain their fiberlike morphology with rough surface. TEM image further manifests that the GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ nanofibers consist of nanoparticles. Under ultraviolet excitation and low-voltage electron beam excitation, GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ phosphors showed their strong characteristic emission due to an efficient energy transfer from vanadate groups to dopants. The optimum doping concentration of Ln 3+ in the GdVO 4 nanofibers also has been investigated. Graphical abstract Research Highlights \u25ba1D and Q-1D GdVO 4 fiber-like nanostructures were prepared electrospinning technique. \u25baUnder ultraviolet excitation and electron beam excitation, the Ln 3+ ions show their characteristic emissions, respectively. \u25baThe quantum efficiencies are 14 (Eu 3+ ), 6 (Dy 3+ ), and 5 % (Sm 3+ ) in GdVO 4 , respectively. Keywords Electrospinning Vanadate Lanthanide Luminescence Nanofibers 1 Introduction As is well known, shape and dimensionality are regarded as particularly important factors that influence the properties of materials. Thus, dramatic efforts have been dedicated to fabricate a range of high-quality inorganic nanomaterials with different morphology. In recent years, much attentions has been paid to preparation of one-dimensional (1D) nanaomaterials including nanowires (NWs), nanorods, nanotubes (NTs), and nanobelts, which exhibit novel physical and chemical properties due to their unique and fascinating characteristics for huge ratio of diameter to length, superior mechanical toughness, and so on [1\u20136] . One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials also play an important role in both fundamental research and technological applications [7\u20139] . It has been reported that the Eu 3+ ions have shown higher quantum efficiency values in 1D LaPO 4 nanowires (via the hydrothermal process) than in 0D LaPO 4 nanoparticles and the corresponding bulk materials [10\u201313] . But it is not easy to control the 1D nanostructures by the hydrothermal process. So it is important to develop some facile synthesis methods to directly prepare luminescent materials in nano-/microscale with defined morphologies. Now, many methods have been used to prepare one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials with different composition, including chemical or physical vapor deposition [14\u201317] , solution [18] , arc discharge [19,20] , laser ablation [14,21] , vapor-phase transport process [22\u201324] , and a template-based method [25\u201327] . Among the various methods, electrospinning is a more simple, effective, and cost-effective approach for generating long fibers with diameters ranging from tens of nanometers up to micrometers. Electrospinning technology has been used to prepare one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials since 1930s [28] . Organic, inorganic, and hybrid (organic\u2013inorganic) compounds [29\u201332] all can be electrospun to form uniform fibers. The sol\u2013gel technique has been proved as an efficient way to produce nanoparticles [33] , which can be employed to prepare precursor solution. A combination method of sol\u2013gel process and electrospinning technique is a good approach to obtain excellent 1D and Q-1D nano-/microstructures, which can be applied in sensors, electronic and optical device, biomedical fields, and catalyst supports [34\u201337] . Accordingly, the preparation of 1D vanadate nanofibers by the novel and facile sol\u2013gel/electrospinning process and investigation on their luminescence properties will be of great interest and importance. Rare earth oxides have been extensively used in high performance luminescent devices due to higher chemical stability than other phosphors such as sulfide phosphors [38,39] . Many investigations [40,41] have been drawn to rare earth vanadates because they are excellent hosts for luminescence materials. Furthermore, gadolinium vanadate is also a promising material for lanthanide ion doped oxide phosphors and near-infrared lasers. In the fields of luminescent material, phosphors based on gadolinium compounds also play an important role because the Gd 3+ ion (4 f 7 , 8 S ) has its lowest excited level at relatively high energy, which is due to the stability of the half-filled shell ground state [38,42] . Gadolinium vanadate crystal as the host of lanthanide ion was first introduced by Zaguniennyi et al. in 1992 [43] . They found that gadolinium vanadate crystal had more advantages than yttrium vanadate crystal such as higher thermal conductivity, lager emission cross-section, and larger absorption cross-section, which was considered to be suitable for laser materials. GdVO 4 :Eu 3+ is a highly efficient red light-emitting material due to a strong absorption of ultraviolet light by GdVO 4 and an efficient energy transfer from VO 4 3 \u2212 groups to Eu 3+ , which can be applied in many fields, such as cathode ray tubes, lamps, X-ray detectors [44\u201347] . If GdVO 4 :Eu 3+ was fabricated in the form of a 1D nanostructure, it would be expected to be highly functional material [48,49] . Besides Eu 3+ ion, Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ ions can also act as useful activators. Frequently, Dy 3+ as activator ions mainly shows emission due to transitions of 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 13/2 in the blue region and 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 15/2 in the yellow region, Sm 3+ as activator ions mainly shows emission due to transitions of ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 5/2 ) in the green region, ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 7/2 ) in the orange region, and ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 9/2 ) in the red region. As far as we know, no study has been reported on synthesis of 1D GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) phosphor materials via the electrospinning process. Therefore, in this paper, we prepared 1D GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers by a combination method of sol\u2013gel process and simple electrospinning technology, and investigated the morphology, structure, photoluminescence, and cathodoluminescence properties of the resulting samples in detail. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and materials Gd 2 O 3 , Eu 2 O 3 , Dy 2 O 3 , and Sm 2 O 3 (99.99%) were purchased from Science and Technology Parent Company of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry. NH 4 VO 3 (99%, analytical reagent, AR) was purchased from Tianjing Damao Chemicals Company. Nitric acid HNO 3 (AR), citric acid monohydrate C 6 H 8 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O (\u226599.5%, AR), and ethanol were all purchased from Beijing Fine Chemical Company. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw=1,300,000) was purchased from Aldrich. All the initial chemicals in this paper were used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers were prepared by an electrospinning process followed by annealing at high temperature. The doping concentrations of Ln 3+ are 1\u201310 mol% of Gd 3+ in GdVO 4 . First, the precursor solution for electrospinning was prepared by the sol\u2013gel technique. The stoichiometric amounts of Gd 2 O 3 , Eu 2 O 3 , Dy 2 O 3 , Sm 2 O 3 , and NH 4 VO 3 were dissolved in dilute nitric acid under heating, and then mixed with water\u2013ethanol (v/v=3:7) solution containing a suitable amount of citric acid (the molar ratio of metal ions to citric acid is 1:2) as a chelating agent for metal ions. Then a certain amount of PVP was added into above solution to form a viscous solution for electrospinning. The weight percentage of PVP was 8% in the water\u2013ethanol solution. After that, the precursor solution was stirred for 4 h to form a homogeneous hybrid solution for electrospinning. Then above precursor solution was loaded into a 5 mL syringe with a flat tip needle. The anode from a high-voltage power was connected with the syringe needle flat tip. The cathode was linked to the grounded collector, and the distance between needle and collector was fixed at 17 cm. The high-voltage power supply was maintained at 13 kV, and the flow rate of spinning solution was controlled at 0.5 mL/h by a syringe pump (TJ-3A/W0109-1B, Boading Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd., China). In this way, the precursor fibers were prepared. Finally, the as-prepared electrospun fibers were calcined to the desired temperature 700 \u00b0C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 \u00b0C/min to remove organic species. 2.3 Characterization The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Rigaku-Dmax 2500 diffractometer using Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb =0.15405 nm). FT-IR spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 580B infrared spectrophotometer with the KBr pellet technique. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) data were recorded with a thermal analysis instrument (SDT 2960, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) with the heating rate of 10 \u00b0C min \u22121 in an air flow of 100 mL min \u22121 . The morphology and structure of the samples were inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, XL30, Philips). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs were obtained from a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin transmission electron microscope with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The cathodoluminescent (CL) measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (<10 \u22128 Torr), where the samples were excited by an electron beam at a voltage range of 3\u20135 kV with different filament currents, and the emission spectra were recorded using an F-7000 spectrophotometer. The luminescence decay curves were obtained from a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 digital oscilloscope (1 GHz) using a tunable laser (pulse width=4 ns, gate=50 ns) as excitation source (Continuum Suncite OPO). The absolute quantum efficiencies of the phosphor samples were measured on the C9920-02 quantum yield measurement system (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan). All the measurements were performed at room temperature (RT). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation and morphology 3.1.1 XRD XRD patterns of the as prepared precursor fibers for GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =5 mol% Eu, 2 mol% Dy, 2 mol% Sm) and those calcined at 700 \u00b0C for 4 h, as well as the standard card of GdVO 4 (JCPDS no. 17-0260) are shown in Fig. 1 , respectively. In Fig. 1 a for the as prepared precursor sample, no diffraction peak is observed except for a broad band at 2 \u03b8 =22\u00b0, which is ascribed to the semicrystalline PVP. When GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ precursor samples were annealed at 700 \u00b0C (in Fig. 2 b\u2013d), well-defined diffraction peaks appeared, and all the diffraction peaks can be well-assigned to tetragonal GdVO 4 (JCPDS no. 17-0260). This manifests that the precursor samples have crystallized into GdVO 4 at this temperature. No peak from second phase is observed, indicating that the Ln 3+ ions have been effectively built into GdVO 4 host lattice by substitution for the Gd 3+ ions. 3.1.2 FT-IR Fig. 2 displays the FT-IR spectra of the as prepared precursor fibers for GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ and those heat-treated at 700 \u00b0C. In Fig. 2 a, a broad band at 3426 cm \u22121 is assigned to the symmetric stretching of \u2013OH group. Some other vibration bands of the \u2212CH 2 group (2957, 1465, and 1424 cm \u22121 ), \u2212C=O group (1656 cm \u22121 ), carbonates COO \u2212 group (1384 cm \u22121 ), and tertiary amine group (1291 cm \u22121 ) can also be detected, which come from precursor fibers (ethanol, citric acid, and PVP) [50\u201352] . After the precursor fibers were calcined at 700 \u00b0C for 4 h ( Fig. 2 b), the absorption peaks of vibration bands from precursor fibers disappear, two new absorption bands are presented. The stronger peak centered at 806 cm \u22121 and the weak peak centered 452 cm \u22121 are attributed to the absorption of V\u2013O (from the VO 4 3 \u2212 group) [53] and Gd\u2013O bonds [54] , respectively. This indicates that crystalline-phase GdVO 4 has formed after annealing at 700 \u00b0C, agreeing well with the results of XRD. 3.1.3 TG-DTA TG-DTA curves of the as prepared precursor fibers for GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ heat-treated in air with a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min are shown in Fig. 3 . The TG curve displays three stages of weight loss. The weight loss (25%) of first stage (40\u2013260 \u00b0C) comes from evaporation of water and alcohol. The second stage (260\u2212368 \u00b0C) weight loss accompanied by an exothermic peak at 312 \u00b0C in the DTA curve is 54%, which can be attributed to the decomposition of organic group (PVP, citric acid, and the citrates) [55\u201356] . An exothermic peak at 400 \u00b0C in the DTA curve is correlated with the third stage weight loss (13%) from 368 to 510 \u00b0C, which is caused by the further combustion of residual organic compounds. When the temperature reached above 510 \u00b0C, there was no change in weight loss, indicating the formation of stable inorganic phase. 3.1.4 SEM and TEM The morphology and structure of samples were investigated by the SEM and TEM observations. The SEM images of as prepared precursor fibers for GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ and those heated at 700 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 4 . From the low-magnification SEM image of the precursor fibers ( Fig. 4 a) and resulting nanofibers ( Fig. 4 c), it can be seen that the samples consist of uniform fibers with lengths of several tens to hundreds micrometers. High-magnification SEM images show that the surface of the as prepared precursor fibers ( Fig. 4 b) is smooth with diameters ranging from 230 to 460 nm. After being calcined at 700 \u00b0C for 4 h ( Fig. 4 d), the fiber surfaces become rough and the fiber diameters decrease greatly due to the decomposition of the organic species and the formation of inorganic phase, and the diameters range from 100 to 160 nm. In fact, the morphology and diameter of the electrospun samples are dependent on several process parameters, including the intrinsic properties of the solution and the operational conditions. In order to obtain fibers with perfect uniform morphology, the key is searching for a balance point of various electrospinning parameters. The balance point might be related to the volume ratio of water to alcohol, the weight percentage of PVP, the spinning rate, the strength of the electric field, and the distance between the spinneret and the collector. The final samples (doped with various contents of Ln 3+ ) were also investigated by EDS analyses. The data indicate that the weight percentage of Ln 3+ ions ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) by substituting Gd 3+ into GdVO 4 lattice are 4.66%, 2.28%, and 2.32%, respectively. For the sake of clarity and simpleness in expressions, we still use the nominal compositions in the main text of the paper. Fig. 5 shows the typical TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers annealed at 700 \u00b0C. From Fig. 5 a, it can be observed that the nanofibers are composed of fine and closely linked nanoparticles (the crystallite size is about 28 nm). HRTEM image ( Fig. 5 b) of GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers shows well-resolved lattice fringes. The distance between the adjacent lattice fringes is 0.2690 nm, which corresponds to the interplanar spacing of GdVO 4 (112) planes, agreeing well with the d (112) spacing of the literature value (0.2694 nm; JCPDS no. 17-0260). The result further confirms the formation of crystalline GdVO 4 in nanofibers after thermal treatment, agreeing well with the XRD results. 3.2 Luminescence properties 3.2.1 Photoluminescence properties Fig. 6 exhibits excitation and emission spectra of GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers, respectively. The excitation spectrum ( Fig. 6 a) of GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers was obtained by monitoring the emission of the Eu 3+ transition at 620 nm, ranging from 200 to 450 nm with a maximum peak at 276 nm due to VO 4 3 \u2212 absorption. The intense peak at 276 nm is ascribed to a charge transfer from the oxygen ligands to the central vanadium atom within the VO 4 3 \u2212 group ions [57] . From the viewpoint of molecular orbital theory, it corresponds to transitions from the 1 A 2 ( 1 T 1 ) ground state to 1 A 1 ( 1 E ) and 1 E ( 1 T 2 ) excited states VO 4 3 \u2212 ions [58] . The presence of the strong VO 4 3 \u2212 absorption band in the excitation spectra of Eu 3+ indicates that there exists an efficient energy transfer from GdVO 4 host to the doped Eu 3+ in GdVO 4 :Eu 3+ nanofibers. The emission spectrum ( Fig. 6 b) was obtained under short-wavelength UV irradiation when excitation into the VO 4 3 \u2212 by a 276 nm irradiation. The emission spectrum shows typical emissions of Eu 3+ ions in tetragonal GdVO 4 , which corresponds to f \u2013 f transitions of Eu 3+ . The most intense peak at 620 nm can be assigned to 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 (red) transition. The emission spectrum not only contains the characteristic transition lines from the lowest excited 5 D 0 level of Eu 3+ but also those from higher energy levels ( 5 D 1 , 5 D 2 , 5 D 3 ) of Eu 3+ with a very weak intensity. No emission from the VO 4 3 \u2212 group is detected, suggesting that the energy transfer from VO 4 3\u2212 to Eu 3+ is quite efficient. In addition, the crystal field splitting of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1,2,4 transitions can be seen clearly, indicating that the GdVO 4 :Eu 3+ nanofibers are well-crystallized. Under UV excitation Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ doped GdVO 4 nanofibers exhibit yellow and orange-red emission, respectively. When monitored the emission of the Dy 3+ at 620 nm ( 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 13/2 ) or Sm 3+ at 604 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 7/2 ), the excitation spectra ( Fig. 6 c and e) which have the similar profile as the excitation spectrum of GdVO 4 :Eu 3+ were obtained. A strong and broad band with a maximum at 276 nm come from VO 4 3 \u2212 group also appeared. Excitation into the vanadate group at 276 nm yields the characteristic yellow emission ( Fig. 6 d) of Dy 3+ at 484 nm ( 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 15/2 , blue) and 574 nm ( 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 13/2 , yellow) and orange-red emission ( Fig. 6 f) of Sm 3+ at 567 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 5/2 , green), 604 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 7/2 , orange), and 649 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 9/2 , red), respectively. This indicates that, similar to the situations for Eu 3+ , an efficient energy transfer also occurs from VO 4 3 \u2212 to Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ in GdVO 4 nanofibers. Fig. 7 displays the CIE chromaticity diagram of GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ (5 mol% Eu 3+ , 2 mol% Dy 3+ , 2 mol% Sm 3+ ). From the CIE chromaticity diagram, it can be seen that GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers emit in red region (CIE chromaticity coordinates x =0.614, y =1.314), GdVO 4 :2 mol% Dy 3+ nanofibers in yellow region (CIE chromaticity coordinates x =0.379, y =0.416), and GdVO 4 :2 mol% Sm 3+ nanofibers in orange-red region (CIE chromaticity coordinates x =0.495, y =0.324), respectively. The quantum efficiencies of GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ nanofibers are 14% (5 mol% Eu 3+ ), 6% (2 mol% Dy 3+ ), and 5% (2 mol% Sm 3+ ). In the preparation process of GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ fiber\u2013phosphors, large amount of organic species, such as PVP and citric acid were added in the precursor solution to adjust the viscosity in order to get the continuous fiber samples. After the final annealing process, most of the organic species can be removed accompanied by the crystallization of the samples. However, it is difficult to remove them completely, which is harmful for the luminescence of lanthanide ions ( Ln 3+ ). This may lead to the low quantum efficiency (14%) in GdVO 4 :Eu 3+ fiber phosphors. For further improving the quantum efficiency of the sample, raising the annealing temperature may be an effective route, but too high annealing temperature may destroy the fiber morphology of the sample. As a result, we have to choose a moderate high annealing temperature to keep the perfect fiber morphology in spite of the low quantum efficiency. Here it is expected that the luminescence properties (emission color and peak positions) of Ln 3+ (Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , Sm 3+ ) in 1D nanostructures of GdVO 4 will not be much different from other morphologies because the excitation and emission of Ln 3+ arise from f \u2013 f transitions which are strongly shielded by the outside 5 s and 5 p electrons (but the emission intensity and quantum efficiencies may be of some differences). The reason for this effect is complicated and not very clear at this stage, which needs a large amount of detailed investigations in the future. The photoluminescence decay curves for the representative emission of Eu 3+ (620 nm, 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 ) in GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ nanofibers, Dy 3+ (574 nm, 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 13/2 ) in GdVO 4 :2 mol% Dy 3+ nanofibers, Sm 3+ (604 nm, 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 7/2 ) in GdVO 4 :2 mol% Sm 3+ nanofibers, are shown in Fig. 8 . The decay curves for 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 of Eu 3+ ( Fig. 8 a), 4 F 9/2 \u2013 6 H 13/2 of Dy 3+ ( Fig. 8 b), and 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H 7/2 of Sm 3+ ( Fig. 8 c) can be well fitted into a double-exponential function as I = A 1 exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 1 )+ A 2 exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 2 ). The average luminescence lifetimes for Eu 3+ 5 D 0 state, Dy 3+ 4 F 9/2 state, and Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 state can be determined by the formula as \u03c4= ( A 1 \u03c4 1 2 + A 2 \u03c4 2 2 )/( A 1 \u03c4 1 + A 2 \u03c4 2 ), and the average luminescence lifetimes for Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Sm 3+ are determined to be 0.552, 0.127, and 0.424 ms, respectively. The double-exponential decay behavior of the activator is frequently observed when the excitation energy is transferred from the donor [59,60] . The dependence of the PL emission intensity on its doping concentration ( x ) in Gd (1\u2212 x ) VO 4 : xLn 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers was shown in Fig. 9 a\u2013c, respectively. By varying the content of the rare earth ions (Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Sm 3+ ) in the GdVO 4 nanofibers, we determined the compositions with the highest PL emission intensity. From Fig. 9 , it can be found that the PL emission intensity of Eu 3+ ( Fig. 9 a), Dy 3+ ( Fig. 9 b), and Sm 3+ ( Fig. 9 c) increase with the increase in their concentration ( x ) first, reaching a maximum value at x =5 mol% for Eu 3+ and at x =2 mol% for Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ , respectively, and then decrease with the increase in their concentration ( x ) due to the concentration quenching effect. Thus, the optimum concentration for Eu 3+ is 5 mol% and those for Dy 3+ , Sm 3+ are 2 mol% in GdVO 4 nanofibers phosphors, respectively. The low critical quenching concentration of Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ may be caused by the cross-relaxation effect of these two ions, i.e., Dy 3+ ( 4 F 9/2 )+Dy 3+ ( 6 H 15/2 )\u2192Dy 3+ ( 6 F 3/2 )+Dy 3+ ( 6 H 9/2, 11/2 ), Sm 3+ ( 4 G 5/2 )+Sm 3+ ( 6 H 5/2 ) \u2192 2Sm 3+ ( 4 F 9/2 ). In general, the cross-relaxation effect will make the activator ion have a low quenching concentration [38] . No such cross-relaxation exists for Eu 3+ , so it has a relatively high quenching concentration. The average distances ( R ) between Ln 3+ ions can be estimated in terms of the equation R =2(3 V /4 \u03c0XN ) 1/3 (where V is the volume of the unit cell, X is the concentration, and N is the number of available crystallographic sites occupied by the activator ions in the unit cell) [61] . The corresponding R ( Ln 3+ \u2013 Ln 3+ ) values for Gd (1\u2212 x ) VO 4 : xLn 3+ ( x =5 mol% Eu 3+ , 2 mol% Dy, 2 mol% Sm) nanofibers are calculated (the related crystal parameters V =0.330 nm 3 , Z =4, and N =Z\u00d71=4). The average distances ( R ) between Eu 3+ ions is 1.466 nm when the doping concentration reaches 5 mol% and those between Dy 3+ , Sm 3+ are 1.990 nm when doping concentration reaches 2 mol%, respectively. 3.2.2 Cathodoluminescence properties The CL spectrum properties of resulting samples were further investigated. The representive CL spectrum of GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers is shown in Fig. 10 , which have identical shape as the PL emission spectrum. Thus, under the low-voltage electron beam excitation, the as prepared GdVO 4 :5 mol% Eu 3+ ( Fig. 10 a), GdVO 4 :2 mol% Dy 3+ ( Fig. 10 b), GdVO 4 :2 mol% Sm 3+ ( Fig. 10 c) nanofibers also show strong red, yellow, and orange-red emissions. The CL emission intensity for GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =5 mol% Eu, 2 mol% Dy, 2 mol% Sm) nanofibers have been investigated as a function of the filament current and accelerating voltage, as shown in Fig. 11 . When the filament current is fixed at 105 mA, the CL intensity increases with increase in the accelerating voltage from 3.0 to 5.0 kV ( Fig. 11 a). Similarly, when the accelerating voltage is maintained at 5 kV, the CL intensity increases with raising the filament current from 97 to 105 mA ( Fig. 11 b). The increase in CL brightness with an increase in electron energy and filament current are attributed to the deeper penetration of the electrons into the phosphors and the larger electron beam current density. The electron penetration depth can be estimated using the empirical formula L [\u00c5]=250( A / \u03c1 )( E / Z 1/2 ) n , where n =1.2/(1\u22120.29 log Z ), A is the atomic or molecular weight of the material, \u03c1 is the bulk density, Z is the atomic number or the number of electrons per molecule in the case compounds, and E is the accelerating voltage (kV) [62] . For cathodoluminescence, the Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Sm 3+ ions are excited by the plasmons produced by the incident electrons. The deeper the selectron penetration depth, the more plasmons will be produced, which results in more Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Sm 3+ ions being excited and thus the CL intensity increases. 4 Conclusions In summary, one-dimensional GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers were successfully prepared by means of electrospinning technique in conjunction with sol\u2013gel process. As prepared precursor samples present uniform fiberlike morphology and smooth surface with a length of several tens to hundreds of micrometers and diameters ranging from 230 to 460 nm. After precursor annealed at 700 \u00b0C for 4 h, the as-formed samples are well-crystallized with their fiberlike morphology. These as-formed GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ nanofibers consist of linked nanoparticles with the diameters ranging from 100 to 160 nm. The spectral and kinetic properties of those have also been investigated in detail. Under the short wavelength ultraviolet irradiation and the low-voltage electron beam excitation, GdVO 4 : Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) nanofibers exhibit typical red, yellow, and orange-red emissions. The CL intensity increases with increase in accelerating voltage and filament current. The optimum doping concentration of Ln 3+ ( Ln =Eu, Dy, Sm) in the GdVO 4 nanofibers are 5, 2, and 2 mol%, respectively.

Luminescence and FT-IR spectra were used to characterize the resulted hybrid SiO 2 xerogels. The result of FT-IR spectrum shows that the xerogels are composed of non-crystalline \ue5f8Si\ue5f8O\ue5f8Si\ue5f8 networks containing some organic groups such as \ue5f8NH, \ue5f8CH and \ue5f8OH. Under the excitation of 365 nm, all the hybrid xerogels exhibit strong luminescence in the blue region, but the emission intensity and position depend on the starting precursor compositions to a large extent. Suitable amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG500 and PEG10000) in the hybrid xerogels can enhance the emission intensity. Additionally, the emission intensity of the hybrid xerogels increases with heat treatment temperature in the range of ambient to 200 \u00b0C, and vacuum condition is also able to enhance the emission intensity.",

        "abstract": "Sr In2 O4: Dy3+ Pr3+ Tb3+ white/red/green phosphors were prepared by the Pechini sol-gel process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), diffuse reflectance, photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence spectra, and lifetimes were utilized to characterize the samples. XRD reveal that the samples begin to crystallize at 800\u00b0C and pure Sr In2 O4 phase can be obtained at 900\u00b0C. FE-SEM images indicate that the Sr In2 O4: Dy3+, Sr In2 O4: Pr3+, and Sr In2 O4: Tb3+ samples consist of fine and spherical grains with size around 200-400 nm. Under the excitation of ultraviolet light and low-voltage electron beams (1-5 kV), the Sr In2 O4: Dy3+, Sr In2 O4: Pr3+, and Sr In2 O4: Tb3+ phosphors show the characteristic emissions of Dy3+ (F 92 4 - H 152 6 at 492 nm and F 92 4 - H 132 6 at 581 nm, near white), Pr3+ (P03 - H43 at 493 nm, D21 - H43 at 606 nm, and P03 - H63 at 617 nm, red) and Tb3+ (D45 - F 6,5,4,3 7 transitions dominated by D45 - F57 at 544 nm, green), respectively. All of the luminescence resulted from an efficient energy transfer from the Sr In2 O4 host lattice to the doped Dy3+, Pr3+, and Tb3+ ions, and the luminescence mechanisms have been proposed. \u00a9 2006 The Electrochemical Society.",

The as-formed products via the hydrothermal process, monoclinic yttrium oxide hydroxide nitrate, Y 4O(OH)9(NO3), could transform to cubic Y 2O3 with the same morphology after annealing at high temperatures. The formation mechanism for the Y4(OH) 9(NO3) trilobal prisms has been proposed.

The purified crystalline phases of Y 2 O 3 :Sm and Gd 2 O 3 :Sm were obtained at 600\u00b0C, and the crystallinity increases with increase in annealing temperature. Both samples contain aggregated phosphor particles. An energy transfer (ET) from Y 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 hosts to sm 3+ has been observed, and the ET efficiency in the latter is higher than that in the former because an energy migration process like Gd 3+ \u2013(Gd 3+ ) n \u2013Sm 3+ has occurred in the latter. Furthermore, an upconversion luminescence from the 4 G 5/2 level of Sm 3+ has been observed in both Y 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 under the excitation of 936 nm infrared, whose mechanisms are proposed. Both the up and downconversion emission intensities of Sm 3+ in Gd 2 O 3 are stronger than those in Y 2 O 3 .",

In this paper, amorphous Al2O3 powder samples were prepared via the Pechini-type sol-gel process. The resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra, kinetic decay, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The obtained amorphous Al2O3 powder samples annealed at 500 and 600 degrees C exhibit bright bluish-white emission centered at 430 and 407 nm, respectively. The luminescent mechanisms of the amorphous Al2O3 powder samples can be ascribed to the carbon-related impurities such as radical carbonyl species. The calculated band structure of the defective amorphous Al2O3 agrees well with the results of spectral analysis and the proposed luminescent mechanism.",

XRD, UV/vis, TEM, and magnetic measurements are utilized to characterize the nanocomposites. XRD only gives FCC patterns of gold for the obtained nanoparticles. The absorption band of the Fe@Au colloid shifts to a longer wavelength and broadens relative to that of the pure gold colloid. TEM results show that the average size of Fe@Au nanoparticles is about 10 nm. These nanoparticles are self-assembled into chains on micron scale under a 0.5 T magnetic field. Magnetic measurements show that the particles are superparamagnetic with a blocking temperature ( T B ) of 42 K. At 300 K (above T B ), no coercivity (Hc) and remanence ( M r ) is observed in the magnetization curve, while at 2 K (below T B ) Hc and M r are observed to be 728 Oe and 4.12 emu/g, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Eu3+-activated calcium silicate (CaO-SiO2:Eu3+) luminescent films were prepared by the sol-gel method. The structural evolution of the film was studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the luminescence properties of the phosphor films were investigated as a function of heat treatment temperature. The XRD study indicates that a kilchoanite phase forms in the film sintered at 800\u00b0C, which is different from that in gel powder treated under the same conditions. The SEM results show that the film thickness decreases and the particles in the film become smaller with increasing heat treatment temperature. The CaO-SiO2:Eu film shows the characteristic emission of Eu3+ under UV excitation, with the Eu3+ 5D0\u21927F2 band (616 nm) being the most prominent. A large difference in the Eu3+ lifetime is observed between the film samples treated at 500 and 700\u00b0C (or above). Concentration quenching occurs when the Eu3+ doping concentration is above 6 mol% of Ca2+ in the film.",

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize the resulted BAM:Eu2+ phosphors. The obtained BAM:Eu2+ phosphor particles have spherical shape, submicron size (0.5-3 \u03bcm). The effects of process conditions of the spray pyrolysis, such as molecular weight and concentration of PEG, on the morphology and luminescence properties of phosphor particles were investigated. Adequate amount of PEG was necessary for obtaining spherical particles, and the optimum emission intensity could be obtained when the concentration of PEG was 0.03 g/ml in the precursor solution. Moreover, the emission intensity of the phosphors increased with increasing of metal ion concentration in the solution. Compared with the BAM:Eu2+ phosphor prepared by citrate-gel method, spherical BAM:Eu2+ phosphor particles showed a higher emission intensity. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "A sol-gel, technique was used to prepare Gd2Ti2O 7:Eu3+-coated submicron silica spheres (SiO 2@Gd2Ti2O7:Eu3+). The resulted SiO2@Gd2Ti2O7:Eu 3+ core-shell particles were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectra (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as well as kinetic decays. The XRD results demonstrate that the Gd2Ti2O 7:Eu3+ layers begin to crystallize on the SiO2 spheres after annealing at 800 \u00b0C and the crystallinity increases with raising the annealing temperature. The obtained core-shell phosphors have perfect spherical shape with narrow size distribution (average size -620 nm), non-agglomeration, and smooth surface. The thickness of the Gd 2Ti2O7:Eu3+ shells on the SiO 2 cores could be easily tailored by varying the number of deposition cycles (60 nm for four deposition cycles). Under the irradiation of 310 nm ultraviolet, the SiO2@Gd2Ti2O 7:Eu3+ samples show strong emission of Eu3+. For the samples annealed from 600 to 800 \u00b0C, the emission is dominated by 613 nm red emission ascribed to 5D0-7F 2 transition of Eu3+, while for those annealed from 900 to 1000 \u00b0C, the emission is dominated by 588 nm orange emission due to 5D0-7F1 transition of Eu 3+. The PL intensity of Eu3+ increases with increasing the annealing temperature and the number of coating cycles. \u00a9 2006 Materials Research Society.",

First, monodisperse silica spheres with an average size around 750 nm have been obtained via the St\u00f6ber method by the hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane Si(OC2H5)4 under base condition (using NH4OH as the catalyst). Second, the silica spheres are coated with Zn2SiO4:Mn phosphor layers by a sol-gel process. The resulting core-shell particles are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, low-voltage cathodoluminescence, as well as kinetic decay. The results confirm that the 1000\u00b0C-annealed sample consists of crystalline Zn2SiO4:Mn shells and amorphous SiO 2 cores with spherical morphology and narrow size distribution. The Zn2SiO4:Mn@SiO2 particles show the green emission at 521 nm corresponding to 4T1( 4G)-6A1(6S) transition of Mn 2+ under the excitation of UV (250 nm), vacuum UV (172 nm), and electron-beams (1-6 kV).

In this work, doxorubicin (DOX) was successfully in situ loaded into a COF by a one-pot method for the first time. The resultant DOX@COF platform exhibited high drug loading capacity (32.1 wt%) and pH responsive release property.

        "abstract": "We have observed an appearance of clear morphological structure in composites containing In2O3 nanocrystals (NCs) incorporated into polymethyl methacrylite (PMMA) matrices under optical treatment by a polarized femtosecond laser. The initial photoinduced treatment was carried out using a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser emitting 140fs p-polarized light at a maximum spectral wavelength 775nm with pulse repetition 1kHz. It was found that the average morphological radius is varied maximally only during illumination at liquid helium temperature (T \u2264 4.2K). The morphological average mean radius is strictly dependent on the sizes of incorporated In 2O3 NCs. Afterwards we measured the linear electrooptic effect at cw He-Ne laser wavelength 633nm during simultaneous treatment by 1060 and 530nm coherent beams of a Nd-YAG picosecond laser. We have established that a decrease of the average morphological mean radius favours an increase of the optically poled linear electrooptic coefficient. The diameters of In 2O3 NCs were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and light-scattering techniques, whereas the NC sizes and morphological average mean radius of formed nanocomposites were estimated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). A relationship between the diameter of the NC, composite morphological mean average radius and effective linear electrooptic coefficient was established. \u00a9 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), low-voltage cathodoluminescence (CL), time-resolved PL spectra and lifetimes were used to characterize the core-shell structured materials. Both XRD and FT-IR indicate that CaWO4 layers have been successfully coated on the SiO2 particles, which can be further verified by the FESEM and TEM images. The PL and CL demonstrate that the SiO2@CaWO4 sample exhibits blue emission band with a maximum at 420 nm (lifetime \u2264 12.8 \u03bds) originated from the WO4 2- groups, while SiO 2@CaWO4:Eu3+ and SiO2@CaWO 4:Tb3+ show additional red emission dominated by 614 nm (Eu3+:5D0-7F2 transition, lifetime \u2264 1.04 ms) and green emission at 544 nm (Tb3+: 5D4-7F5 transition, lifetime \u2264 1.38 ms), respectively. The PL excitation, emission and time-resolved spectra suggest that there exists an energy transfer from WO4 2- to Eu3+ and Tb3+ in SiO2@CaWO 4:Eu3+ and SiO2@CaWO4:Tb 3+, respectively. The energy transfer from WO4 2- to Tb3+ in SiO2@CaWO4:Tb 3+ is more efficient than that from WO4 2- to Eu3+ in SiO2@CaWO4:Eu3+. \u00a9 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors were prepared by the sol\u2013gel process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the resulting SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors. The XRD results demonstrate that the Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ layers on the SiO 2 spheres begin to crystallize after annealing at 600 \u00b0C and the crystallinity increases with raising the annealing temperature. The obtained core\u2013shell phosphors have a near perfect spherical shape with narrow size distribution (average size ca. 600 nm), are not agglomerated, and have a smooth surface. The thickness of the Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shells on the SiO 2 cores could be easily tailored by varying the number of deposition cycles (50 nm for four deposition cycles). The Eu 3+ shows a strong PL luminescence (dominated by 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 red emission at 613 nm) under the excitation of 307 nm UV light. The PL intensity of Eu 3+ increases with increasing the annealing temperature and the number of coating cycles. Keywords SiO 2 Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ Core\u2013shell Sol\u2013gel process Luminescent properties 1 Introduction Currently, there exist a large variety of technological applications of composite colloidal particles consisting of a core and a shell with different compositions [1\u20133] . In any case, the aim is to take advantage of the properties of both the core (e.g., size, shape) and the shell (e.g., luminescence properties) materials. In the case of the particular combination chosen for the current study, the core (silica) is a well-known solid that can be prepared as colloidal particles of defined geometry, monodisperse in size and shape, and covering a wide range of both particle diameters (from about 50 nm to several microns) and geometries (spheres) [4] . Several investigators have reported on the deposition of nanoparticles on silica spheres. They used a variety of techniques including the inverse micelle method, pretreatment steps in electroless plating, double-jet precipitation, layer-by-layer technique, template directed self-assembly and encapsulation of silica nanoparticles by in situ polymerization [5\u20138] . Generally, these techniques need expensive and complicated equipment setups. There are few reports on silica particles coated with phosphor layers [9\u201312] . These spherical core\u2013shell structured phosphors have many merits. First, silica can be easily made controllably in spherical morphology from nano to micron size [13] . If the silica spheres are coated with layers of phosphors, a kind of core\u2013shell phosphor materials with spherical morphology will be obtained, and the size of the phosphor particles can be controlled by the silica cores. Secondly, the non-agglomeration, narrow size distribution and the near perfect spherical shape are the ideal morphology for phosphor particles, which have high packing densities and a low light scattering. All these are good for improvement of brightness and resolution. Finally, because silica is cheaper than most of the phosphor materials (which often employ the expensive rare earth elements as activators and/or host components), the core\u2013shell phosphor materials will be cheaper than the pure phosphor materials in unit mass. Materials belonging to the tungstate and molybdate families have a long history of practical application and have been the object of extensive research over the past century. The continuous interest in these compounds arises from their excellent optical properties which form the basis of their wide use as a phosphor, laser materials, and scintillation detectors [14\u201317] . To our knowledge, core\u2013shell structures using SiO 2 coated with the Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ phosphors spheres have not been reported in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we synthesized the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell structured phosphors by a simple and economical solution method based on the sol\u2013gel process [18] . The structure, morphology and photoluminescent properties of the obtained phosphors are also characterized and discussed in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Synthesis of silica cores Amorphous submicron spheres of silica in the size range of 500\u2013600 nm were synthesized by the well known St\u00f6ber process, i.e., the hydrolysis of TEOS in an ethanol solution containing water and ammonia [19] . This method yielded the colloidal solution of silica particles with a narrow size distribution in the submicron range, and the particle size of silica depended on relative concentration of the reactants. In a typical experiment, the mixture containing 21 mL of TEOS (99 wt.%, analytical reagent, A.R., Beijing Beihua Chemicals Co., Ltd.), 9 mL of deionized H 2 O, and 245 mL of NH 4 OH (25 wt.%, A.R., Beijing Beihua Chemicals Co., Ltd.) were added into 225 mL of absolute ethanol and stirred at room temperature for 4 h, resulting in the formation of a white silica colloidal suspension. The silica particles were centrifugally separated from the suspension and washed with ethanol four times. 2.2 Coating of SiO 2 cores with Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shells SiO 2 core/Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shell particles (SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ ) were prepared by sol\u2013gel process [20] . The doping concentration of Eu 3+ was 2 at.% of Gd 3+ in Gd 2 MoO 6 host (Gd 1.96 Eu 0.04 MoO 6 ), which had been optimized by us previously [21] . 7.84 mmol Gd 2 O 3 (99.99%, Shanghai Yuelong New Materials Co., Ltd.) and 0.16 mmol Eu 2 O 3 (99.99%, Shanghai Yuelong New Materials Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in dilute HNO 3 (A.R., Beijing Beihua Chemicals Co., Ltd.) under vigorous stirring, and the superfluous HNO 3 was driven off until the pH value of the solution reached between two and three. Then 30 mL water\u2013ethanol (v/v = 3:1) solution and 1.1428 mmol ammonium molybdate [(NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 \u00b7 4H 2 O] (A.R., Beijing Beihua Chemicals Co., Ltd.) were added to the solution. Subsequently, 32 mmol citric acid (A.R., Beijing Beihua Chemicals Co., Ltd.) as chelating agent for the metal ions was added to the above solution. The resulting molar concentrations for Gd 3+ and Eu 3+ ions are 0.5227 mol/L and 0.0107 mol/L, respectively. Then 0.48 mmol polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight = 10 000, A.R., Beijing Beihua Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was added as cross-linking agent. Highly transparent sols were obtained after stirred for a few hours, and then 50 mmol silica particles were added under stirring. The suspension was further stirred for another 3 h, and then the particles were separated by centrifugation. The particle samples were dried at 100 \u00b0C for 1 h and then annealed to the desired temperature (300\u2013800 \u00b0C) with a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C/min and held there for 2 h in air. The above process was repeated several times to increase the thickness of the Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shells. In this way, the core\u2013shell structured SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ materials were obtained, and the whole process is shown in Scheme 1 . In a similar process to produce pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ powder phosphors, the coating sol was evaporated to form powders, which were annealed at 800 \u00b0C for 2 h. 2.3 Characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattens of the powder samples were examined on a Rigaku\u2013Dmax 2500 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15405 nm). FT-IR spectra were measured with Perking\u2013Elmer 580B infrared spectrophotometer with the KBr pellet technique. The morphology of samples was inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope (XL30, Philips) and transmission electron microscope (JEOL-2010, 200 kV). The excitation and emission spectra were taken on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. Luminescence decay curves were obtained from a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 Digital Oscilloscope (1 GHz) using 307 nm laser (pulse width = 4 ns, gate = 50 ns) as the excitation source (Continuum Sunlite OPO). All the measurements were performed at room temperature (RT). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation and morphology X-ray diffraction patterns of bare SiO 2 (a), SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ (b), pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ (c) powder samples as well as the JCPDS card (No. 24-0423) for Gd 2 MoO 6 (d) were shown in Fig. 1 . For SiO 2 particles ( Fig. 1 (a)), no diffraction peak is observed except for a broad band centered at 2 \u03b8 = 22.00\u00b0, which is the characteristic peak for amorphous SiO 2 (JCPDS 29-0085). For the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell sample fired at 800 \u00b0C ( Fig. 1 (b)), besides the broad band at 2 \u03b8 = 22.00\u00b0 from amorphous SiO 2 , all the diffraction peaks belonging to crystalline Gd 2 MoO 6 are present, suggesting that the coatings of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ have crystallized well on the surfaces of amorphous silica particles. This can also be confirmed by comparison with the situation for the pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ powder sample annealed at 800 \u00b0C ( Fig. 1 (c)), in which well crystallized Gd 2 MoO 6 is observed. No other phase is detected. The FT-IR spectra of the as formed SiO 2 , 800 \u00b0C annealed SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell sample and pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ powders are shown in Fig. 2 (a)\u2013(c), respectively. In Fig. 2 (a) the absorption bands due to OH (3435 cm \u22121 ), H 2 O (1637 cm \u22121 ), Si\u2013O\u2013Si ( \u03bd as , 1100 cm \u22121 ; \u03bd s , 803 cm \u22121 ) Si\u2013OH ( \u03bd s , 949 cm \u22121 ), and Si\u2013O ( \u03b4 , 469 cm \u22121 ) bonds (where \u03bd as = asymmetric stretching, \u03bd s = symmetric stretching, \u03b4 = bending) of the as formed SiO 2 particles are shown [22] . This indicates that the as formed SiO 2 particles contain a large amount of OH groups and H 2 O on their surfaces [23] . The surface Si\u2013OH groups play an important role for bonding the metal ions (Gd 3+ , Eu 3+ ) from the coating sol and forming the Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ layers on the SiO 2 surfaces in the following annealing process, as shown in Scheme 1 . In Fig. 2 (b) for the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell sample, the characteristic absorption peaks of Gd (Eu)\u2013O bond ( \u03bd s , 545 cm \u22121 ) [24] , Mo\u2013O bond ( \u03bd s , 712 cm \u22121 , 781 cm \u22121 , 855 cm \u22121 ) [25] , Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond (1111 cm \u22121 ) and Si\u2013O bond (469 cm \u22121 ) for amorphous SiO 2 ( Fig. 2 (a)) have been observed clearly. For pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ powders ( Fig. 2 (c)), the weak Gd\u2013O at 545 cm \u22121 and Mo\u2013O bond ( \u03bd s , 707 cm \u22121 , 777 cm \u22121 , 853 cm \u22121 ) were observed also. This suggests that crystalline phase of Gd 2 MoO 6 has formed after annealing at 800 \u00b0C, agreeing well with the results of XRD. The signal of OH groups from the as formed silica particles has almost disappeared for SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell particles annealed at 800 \u00b0C. These results are consistent with those of XRD, and further demonstrate the formation of crystalline Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ coatings on the silica surfaces via the sol\u2013gel deposition and annealing process. Fig. 3 (a)\u2013(c) shows the FESEM micrographs of the as formed SiO 2 particles, SiO 2 particles coated by four layers of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ and the pure Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 :Eu 3+ powders, respectively. From Fig. 3 (a) we can observe that the as formed SiO 2 consists of spherical particles with an average size of 500 nm, and these particles are non-aggregated with narrow size distribution. After functionalizing the silica particles by Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ coatings, the resulted SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ particles still keep the morphological properties of the silica particles, i.e., these particles are still spherical and non-aggregated, but slightly larger than the pure silica particles due to the additional layers of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ on them, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). This indicates that all of the Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ material has been deposited on the surfaces of the silica particles by our experimental process. Whereas the pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ powders contain aggregated particles, as shown in Fig. 3 (c). It should be mentioned that the FESEM micrographs can only provide the basic information on the morphology of SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ particles in a large scale (namely, all of the SiO 2 particles remain spherical and non-aggregated subjected to the sol\u2013gel coating of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ layers on them) and the core\u2013shell structure of SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ particles cannot be resolved from the FESEM micrographs due to the low magnification. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis of SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ in Fig. 3 (d) shows the composites are composed of Si, O, Gd, Eu and Mo elements. In order to see the core\u2013shell structure of SiO 2 @ Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ particles, TEM technique was applied. Representative TEM micrographs for the SiO 2 particles coated by four times (layers) of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shells as well as for the pure SiO 2 particles (as reference) are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 4 (a), the core\u2013shell structure for the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ particles can be seen clearly due to the different electron penetrability for the cores and shells. The cores are black spheres with an average size of 500 nm (similar to the pure SiO 2 particles in Fig. 4 (b)), and the shells have gray color with an average thickness of 50 nm. The electron diffraction measurement was performed in the interface region of the core and shell of a particle as labeled in Fig. 4 (a), and the electron diffraction rings with some disorder in Fig. 4 (a, inset) just demonstrate the coexistence of crystalline phase (Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ ) and amorphous phase (SiO 2 ) in the interface region of the core\u2013shell particle. 3.2 Photoluminescence properties Fig. 5 shows the excitation (a) and emission (b) spectra of SiO 2 @Gd 1.96 Eu 0.04 MoO 6 core\u2013shell phosphors. The excitation spectrum was obtained by monitoring the emission of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition at 613 nm. It can be seen clearly that the excitation spectrum consists of a strong and broad band with a maximum at about 307 nm, which can be attributed to the Gd 2 MoO 6 host excitation band, together with the Eu\u2013O charge transfer band. Sharp lines at 397 nm ( 7 F 0 \u2013 5 L 6 ) and 467 nm ( 7 F 0 \u2013 5 D 2 ) can also be observed in the excitation spectrum, which are due to the f\u2013f transition lines of Eu 3+ . The presence of the strong Gd 2 MoO 6 host band in the excitation spectrum of Eu 3+ indicates that there exists an energy transfer from Gd 2 MoO 6 host to the doped Eu 3+ . Excitation into Gd 2 MoO 6 host band at 307 nm yields the emission spectrum corresponding to f\u2013f transitions of Eu 3+ ( Fig. 5 (b)), which is dominated by the hypersensitive red emission 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition at 613 nm. In this emission spectrum, not only the characteristic transition lines from the lowest excited 5 D 0 level of Eu 3+ are observed but also those from higher energy levels ( 5 D 1 , 5 D 2 and 5 D 3 ) of Eu 3+ are detected, though with a very weak intensity. The locations of the emission lines of Eu 3+ and their assignments are indicated in the Fig. 5 (b). Obviously, the strong emission of Eu 3+ is also due to an efficient energy transfer from the MoO 6 6 - group to Eu 3+ in SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell particles. Eu 3+ 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 emission belongs to hypersensitive transition with \u0394 J = 2, which is strongly influenced by outside surroundings and can be served as a very efficient and sensitive structural probe [26] . The crystalline Gd 2 MoO 6 belongs to the monoclinic phase with space group I2/a (15) whose structure is similar to that of the sheelite-type compound Bi 2 MoO 6 . Additionally, all the cations in this structure are eight-coordinated, and the anions are four-coordinated. Since the Gd coordination environment is less regular due to the wide variations in the O\u2013Gd\u2013O bond angles and length in Gd 2 MoO 6 [27] , it is expected that the Gd 3+ ions are located at sites with no inversion symmetry center in Gd 2 MoO 6 . It is well known that when the Eu 3+ ion is located at crystallographic site without inversion symmetry, its hypersensitive transition 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 red emission will dominate in the emission spectrum; otherwise, if the Eu 3+ site possesses an inversion center, its 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 (orange) emission will dominate [28] . Apparently, in SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell particles phosphors, the Eu 3+ will replace the Gd 3+ in view of their similar sizes [ r (Eu 3+ ) = 0.095 nm, r (Gd 3+ ) = 0.094 nm] and valence state (+3). Since the Eu 3+ ions are located at sites without inversion symmetry in the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell particles, it is expected that the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition will dominate in the emission spectra, just as shown in Figs. 5 (b). In addition, the emission lines from higher excited states of Eu 3+ ( 5 D 1 ) can also be observed in the core\u2013shell particles. This can be ascribed to the fact that the low vibration energy of MoO 4 6 - group (712 cm \u22121 , 781 cm \u22121 , 855 cm \u22121 ) is not able to bridge the gaps between the higher energy level 5 D 1 and the 5 D 0 level of Eu 3+ completely [28] . A representative decay curve for the luminescence of Eu 3+ ion 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 (613 nm) in the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors annealed at 800 \u00b0C is shown in Fig 6 (The inset is the decay curve at initial time scale). The decay curve can be well fitted into single exponential function as I = I 0 exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 ), ( I 0 is the initial emission intensity for t = 0, \u03c4 is the 1/e lifetime of the rare earth ion) and the fitting parameters are shown inside Fig. 6 . A lifetime ( \u03c4 ) of 1.008 ms is obtained for 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 (613 nm) emission of Eu 3+ in SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ sample. It can be seen from the inset in Fig. 6 that the emission intensity of Eu 3+ is decayed very fast at initial time scale and then slowly after the initial \u223c12 \u03bcs. The luminescence decay satisfied with single exponential law indicates that the environment of Eu 3+ is homogeneous in the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors, i.e., only one kind of luminescent center of Eu 3+ exists in the host. The PL emission intensity of the Eu 3+ in SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors was affected by the annealing temperature. Fig. 7 shows the effect of annealing temperatures on the PL intensities. It can be seen that the PL intensity increases with the increasing of annealing temperatures from 300 to 800 \u00b0C. This is because with the increase of annealing temperature the content of impurities in the SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors such as \u2013OH, NO 3 - , \u2013OR, \u2013CH 2 and others decreases and the crystallinity of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shell increases. The quenching of the luminescence of the Eu 3+ by the vibrations of these impurities decreases, resulting in the increase of their PL emission intensity. The coating number is also an important factor influencing the PL intensity. Fig. 8 shows the effect of coating number on the PL intensity of SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors annealed at the same temperature. The PL intensity increases with the increasing of the coating number, which is due to the increase of the thickness of Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ shells on the SiO 2 spheres. When the coating number is four times, the PL intensity reaches about 79% of that of pure Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ powders, as shown in Fig. 8 . It should be mentioned that when the coating number is higher than four, the PL intensity increases very slowly with the increasing of the coating number until a constant, which indicates the saturation effects occurred due to the self-absorption of the phosphor layer. 4 Conclusions Nanocrystalline SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors were successfully prepared by the sol\u2013gel process using cheap and non-toxic inorganic compounds as main precursors. The obtained SiO 2 @Gd 2 MoO 6 :Eu 3+ core\u2013shell phosphors have a spherical morphology, submicron size and a narrow size distribution. The PL intensity of the core\u2013shell phosphors can be tuned by the annealing temperature and the number of coatings. With the increase of annealing temperature and the number of coatings (1\u20134), the PL intensity increases. The current method can be extended to prepare various other core\u2013shell phosphors with homogeneous morphology and can thus decrease the cost of phosphors to some degree.

        "abstract": "Highly crystalline CaMoO4:Tb3+ phosphor layers were grown on monodisperse SiO2 particles through a simple sol-gel method, resulting in formation of core-shell structured SiO2@CaMoO 4:Tb3+ submicrospheres. The resulting SiO 2@CaMoO4: Tb3+ core-shell particles were fully characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), low-voltage cathodoluminescence (CL), and kinetic decays. The XRD results demonstrate that the CaMoO4:Tb3+ layers begin to crystallize on the SiO2 spheres after annealing at 400\u00b0C and the crystallinity increases with raising the annealing temperature. SEM and TEM analysis indicates that the obtained submicrospheres have a uniform size distribution and obvious core-shell structure. SiO 2@CaMoO4:Tb3+ submicrospheres show strong green emission under short ultraviolet (260 nm) and low-voltage electron beam (1-3 kV) excitation, and the emission spectra are dominated by a 5D 4-7F5 transition of Tb3+ (544 nm, green) from the CaMoO4:Tb3+ shells. Moreover, the PL intensities of Tb3+ increase with increasing annealing temperature and number of coating cycles. The optimum concentration for Tb3+ was determined to be 5 mol % of Ca2+ in CaMoO4 host shells. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

X-Ray diffraction (XRD), TG-DTA, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), FT-IR and luminescence excitation and emission spectra as well as luminescence decays were used to characterize the resulting films. The results of XRD reveal that these films remain amorphous below 700\u00b0C, begin to crystallize at 800\u00b0C and crystallize completely around 1000\u00b0C with an oxyapatite structure. The grain structure of the film can be seen clearly from SEM and AFM micrographs, where particles with various shapes and average size of 250 nm can be resolved. Eu3+ and Tb3+ show their characteristic red (5D0-7F2) and green (5D4-7F5) emission in the films with a quenching concentration of 10 and 6 mol% (of Y3+), respectively. The lifetime and emission intensity of Eu3+ increase with the temperature treatment from 700 to 1100\u00b0C, while those of Tb3+ show a maximum at 800\u00b0C. Energy transfer phenomena have been observed by activating the oxyapatite film host-lattice Ca2Gd8(SiO4)6O2 with Tb3+ (Dy3+). In addition, Pb2+ can sensitize the Gd3+ sublattice in Ca2Gd8(SiO4)6O2.",

        "abstract": "Rare-earth ion (Eu3+, Tb3+, Ce3+)-doped LaPO4 nanocrystalline thin films and their patterning were fabricated by a Pechini sol-gel process combined with soft lithography on silicon and silica glass substrates. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microcopy (SEM), optical microscopy, absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as lifetimes were used to characterize the resulting films. The results of XRD indicate that the films begin to crystallize at 700\u00b0C and the crystallinity increases with increasing annealing temperature. The morphology of the thin film depends on the annealing temperature and the number of coating layers. The 1000\u00b0C annealed single layer film is transparent to the naked eye, uniform and crack-free with a thickness of about 200 nm and an average grain size of 100 nm. Patterned thin films with different strip widths (5-50 \u03bcm) were obtained by micromolding in capillaries (soft lithography). The doped rare earth ions show their characteristic emission in the nanocrystalline LaPO4 films, i.e., Eu3+ 5D0-7FJ (J = 1, 2, 3, 4), Tb3+ 5D3,4-7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) and Ce3+ 5d-4f transition emissions, respectively. Both the lifetimes and the PL intensities of Eu3+ and Tb3+ increase with increasing annealing temperature, and the optimum concentrations for them were determined to be 5 mol% and 16 mol% of La3+ in LaPO4 thin films, respectively. An energy transfer phenomenon from Ce3+ to Tb3+ has been observed in LaPO4 nanocrystalline thin films, and the energy transfer efficiency depends on the doping concentration of Tb3+ if the concentration of Ce3+ is fixed.",

        "abstract": "We have observed an appearance of clear morphological structure in composites containing In2O3 nanocrystals (NCs) incorporated into polymethyl methacrylite (PMMA) matrices under optical treatment by a polarized femtosecond laser. The initial photoinduced treatment was carried out using a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser emitting 140 fs p-polarized light at a maximum spectral wavelength 775 nm with pulse repetition 1 kHz. It was found that the average morphological radius is varied maximally only during illumination at liquid helium temperature (T = 4.2 K). The morphological average mean radius is strictly dependent on the sizes of incorporated In2O3 NCs. Afterwards we measured the linear electrooptic effect at cw He-Ne laser wavelength 633 nm during simultaneous treatment by 1060 and 530 nm coherent beams of a Nd-YAG picosecond laser. We have established that a decrease of the average morphological mean radius favours an increase of the optically poled linear electrooptic coefficient. The diameters of In2O3 NCs were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and light-scattering techniques, whereas the NC sizes and morphological average mean radius of formed nanocomposites were estimated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). A relationship between the diameter of the NC, composite morphological mean average radius and effective linear electrooptic coefficient was established.

        "abstract": "Silica nanotubes (SNTs) functionalized with magnetic and up-conversion luminescent (UCL) NaYF4:Yb/Er/Gd nanocrystals (NCs) (denoted as MUCNCs@SNTs) have been prepared by single-nozzle electrospinning based on a phase separation effect without any templates. Monodisperse and hydrophilic cubic \u03b1-NaYF4:Yb/Er/Gd NCs decorated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) were fabricated in a facile hydrothermal route. Then, the Gd 3+-doped \u03b1-NaYF4:Yb/Er NCs were dispersed into the electrospinning precursor solution containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), followed by the preparation of precursor nanotubes via electrospinning process. Finally, after annealing at 600\u00b0C, pure MUCNCs@SNTs were obtained. The biocompatibility test on L929 fibroblast cells using MTT assay reveals low cytotoxicity of the composites. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), a typical anti-cancer drug, was introduced into MUCNCs@SNTs to evaluate the loading and sustained release behaviours. The composite carriers provide pH-dependent drug release behaviour owing to abundant Si-OH active bonds of silica and its interactions with DOX. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake behaviour of the MUCNCs@SNTs for HeLa cells were evaluated. For in vitro magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the composites show the promising spin lattice relaxation time (T1) weighted effect and could potentially apply as a T1-positive contrast agent. In addition, the composites show near-infrared UC luminescence and were successfully applied in the bioimaging of HeLa cells. Considering the good biocompatibility, high drug releasing content and pH-dependent drug release of the materials, these magnetic and luminescent composite nanotubes have potential applications in drug sustained release and magnetic resonance/UC luminescence modality imaging.

Herein, liquid-solid-solution (LSS) method was used to prepare nano Fe- soc -MOF for the first time, and then we integrated the as-synthesized nanoscale Fe- soc -MOF with polypyrrole (PPy) to construct a multifunctional theranostic platform. The novel Fe- soc -MOF@PPy core-shell nanohybrids can be triggered by the 808\u202fnm laser irradiation to produce photothermal effect for cancer therapy. The photothermal therapy (PTT) was performed both  in vitro  and  in vivo . This work demonstrates the great potential of the MOF nanocomposites for cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

A sol-gel luminescent thin film (SG-LTF) was then prepared by dispersing the sol onto a silica substrate by a spin coating method. Multi-layer luminescent thin films were prepared by repeating the same process. The luminescent spectra, fluorescence lifetime and thermal stability of the SG-LTFs were investigated. For the reason of comparison polyvinylbutyral (PVB) was added into a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution in which the comparative RE3+ carboxylic acid complexes were previously dissolved to form the DMF/PVB solution and the PVB luminescent thin film (PVB-LTF) was prepared. The results show that a broad excitation band indicates the formation of RE complexes in the solid SG-LTFs. Re ions, which are restrained in the silica matrix, present longer lifetimes and higher thermal stability than that in the PVB-ITF containing the corresponding pure complexes. The different doping concentration of RE (III) complexes in the SG-LTFs and the different change of the emission intensities with the heat treatment temperature in the sol-gel thin film and the sol-gel bulk gel were also discussed in this paper.",

The sol-gel method features low-temperature formation of the phosphor, leading to successful preparation of Pb2+ -activated phosphors which could not be prepared by the dry method at high temperature. The (4f)8-(4f)7(5d)1 absorption band of Tb3+ and the charge-transfer (CT) band of Eu3+ have higher energies and narrower half-widths in the sol-gel-derived phosphors than in the phosphors prepared by the dry method, respectively. The Tb 3+ and Dy3+ ions show stronger emission in the former than in the latter. Both the yellow-to-blue intensity ratio (Y:B) of Dy3+ and the red-to-orange intensity ratio (R : O) of Eu3+ in the sol-gel-derived phosphors are smaller than those for the phosphors derived by the dry method.",

        "abstract": "Lu2 O3: Yb3+ / Ho3+ phosphors were prepared by a Pechini sol-gel process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra, as well as lifetimes were utilized to characterize the synthesized phosphors. XRD and HRTEM results reveal that the samples are obtained with high crystallinity. The FESEM images indicate that Lu2 O3: Yb3+ / Ho3+ phosphors are composed of fine and spherical grains around 50-80 nm in size. Under the excitation of UV light, 980-nm laser, and low-voltage electron beams, all Lu2 O3: Yb3+ / Ho3+ phosphors show the characteristic emission of the Ho3+ ion (F45, S25 \u2192 I85 transition) with green luminescence, which is easily observed by our naked eyes. The corresponding luminescent mechanisms have been discussed. Due to the excellent PL (including upconversion and downconversion) properties, CL properties, and cheap materials of the Lu2 O3: Yb3+ / Ho3+ phosphors, the as-prepared phosphors are potentially applied for fluorescent lamps, upconversion fluorescent labels, and field emission display devices. \u00a9 2010 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Lanthanide-doped sol-gel-derived materials are an attractive type of luminescent materials that can be processed at ambient temperatures. However, the solubility of the lanthanide complexes in the matrix is a problem and it is difficult to obtain a uniform distribution of the complexes. Fortunately, these problems can be solved by covalently linking the lanthanide complex to the sol-gel-derived matrix. In this study, luminescent Eu3+ and Tb 3+ bipyridine complexes were immobilized on sol-gel-derived silica. FT-IR, DTA-TG and luminescence spectra, as well as luminescence decay analysis, were used to characterize the obtained hybrid materials. The organic groups from the bipyridine-Si moiety were mostly destroyed between 220 and 600 \u00b0C. The luminescence properties of lanthanide bipyridine complexes anchored to the backbone of the silica network and the corresponding pure complexes were comparatively investigated, which indicates that the lanthanide bipyridine complex was formed during the hydrolysis and co-condensation of TEOS and modified bipyridine. Excitation at the ligand absorption wavelength (336 nm for the hybrid materials and 350 nm for the pure complexes) resulted in strong emission of the lanthanide ions: Eu3+ 5D0- 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and Tb3+ 5D4-7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) emission lines due to efficient energy transfer from the ligands to the lanthanide ions.",

        "abstract": "Highly uniform and well-dispersed CeO2 and CeO 2:Eu3+ (Sm3+, Tb3+) nanocrystals were prepared by a nonhydrolytic solution route and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), UV/vis absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, respectively. The result of XRD indicates that the CeO2 nanocrystals are well crystallized with a cubic structure. The TEM images illustrate that the average size of CeO2 nanocrystals is about 3.5 nm in diameter. The absorption spectrum of CeO2:Eu3+ nanocrystals exhibits red-shifting with respect to that of the undoped CeO2 nanocrystals. Under the excitation of 440 nm (or 426 nm) light, the colloidal solution of the undoped CeO2 nanocrystals shows a very weak emission band with a maximum at 501 nm, which is remarkably enhanced by doping additional lanthanide ions (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+) in the CeO2 nanocrystals. The emission band is not due to the characteristic emission of the lanthanide ions but might arise from the oxygen vacancy which is introduced in the fluorite lattice of the CeO2 nanocrystals to compensate the effective negative charge associated with the trivalent ions. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Nanocrystalline YVO4:A (A = Eu3+, Dy3+, Sm3+, Er3+) phosphor films and their patterning were fabricated by a Pechini sol-gel process combined with soft lithography. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy, UV/vis transmission and absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and lifetimes were used to characterize the resulting films. The results of XRD indicated that the films began to crystallize at 400 \u00b0C and the crystallinity increased with the increase of annealing temperatures. Transparent nonpatterned phosphor films were uniform and crack-free, which mainly consisted of grains with an average size of 90 nm. Patterned gel and crystalline phosphor film bands with different widths (5-60 \u03bcm) were obtained. Significant shrinkage and a few defects were observed in the patterned films during the heat treatment process. The doped rare earth ions (A) showed their characteristic emission in crystalline YVO4 phosphor films because of an efficient energy transfer from vanadate groups to them. The Sm3+ and Er3+ ions also showed upconversion luminescence in a YVO4 film host. Both the lifetimes and PL intensity of the rare earth ions increased with increasing annealing temperature from 400 to 800 \u00b0C, and the optimum concentration for Eu3+ was determined to be 7 mol % and those for Dy3+, Sm3+, and Er3+ were 2 mol % of Y3+ in YVO4 films, respectively.",

In this paper, amorphous Al2O 3 powder samples were prepared via the Pechini-type sol-gel process. The resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra, kinetic decay, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The obtained amorphous Al2O3 powder samples annealed at 500 and 600\u00b0C exhibit bright bluish-white emission centered at 430 and 407 nm, respectively. The luminescent mechanisms of the amorphous Al2O3 powder samples can be ascribed to the carbon-related impurities such as radical carbonyl species. The calculated band structure of the defective amorphous Al2O3 agrees well with the results of spectral analysis and the proposed luminescent mechanism. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

X-Ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra were utilized to characterize the thin film phosphors. The results of XRD showed that a solid solution formed in YV x P 1\u2212 x O 4 : A film series from x =0 to x =1 with zircon structure, which also held for GdVO 4 : A film. However, LaVO 4 : A film crystallized with a different structure, monazite. AFM study revealed that the phosphor films consisted of homogeneous particles ranging from 90 to 400 nm depending on the compositions. Upon short ultraviolet excitation, the films exhibit the characteristic Sm 3+ 4 G 5/2 \u2013 6 H J ( J =5/2, 7/2, 9/2) emission in the red region and Er 3+ 2 H 11/2 , 4 S 3/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 emission in the green region, respectively. With the increase of x values in YV x P 1\u2212 x O 4 : Sm 3+ (Er 3+ ) films, the emission intensity of Sm 3+ (Er 3+ ) increases due to the increase of energy transfer probability from VO 4 3\u2212 to Sm 3+ (Er 3+ ). Due to the structural effects, the Sm 3+ (Er 3+ ) shows similar spectral properties in YVO 4 and GdVO 4 films, which are much different from those in LaVO 4 film.",

The gels exhibit the characteristic emission bands of europium ions and the characteristic excitation bands of lanthanide complexes. In addition, EU3+ presents a longer fluorescence lifetime with higher colorimetric purity in gel than in the corresponding pure complex.",

The resulting YAG based phosphors were characterized by XRD and photoluminescent excitation and emission spectra as well as lifetimes. The purified crystalline phases of YAG were obtained at 800\u00b0C (CG) and 900\u00b0C (CP and SS), respectively. Great differences were observed for the excitation and emission spectra of Eu3+ and Dy 3+ between crystalline and amorphous states of YAG, and their emission intensities increased with increasing the annealing temperature. At an identical annealing temperature and doping concentration, the Eu3+ and Dy3+ showed the strongest and weakest emission intensity in CP- and CG-derived YAG phosphors, respectively. The poor emission intensity for CG-derived phosphors is mainly caused by the contamination organic impurities from citric acid in the starting materials. Furthermore, the lifetimes for the samples derived from CG and CP routes are shorter than those derived from the SS route. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, BPO 4 and Ba 2+-doped BPO 4 powder samples were prepared by the sol-gel process using glycerol and poly(ethylene glycol) as additives. The structure and optical properties of the resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), diffuse reflection spectra, photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra, quantum yield, kinetic decay, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), respectively. It was found that the undoped BPO 4 showed a weak purple blue emission (409 nm, lifetime 6.4 ns) due to the carbon impurities involved in the host lattice. Doping Ba 2+ into BPO 4 resulted in oxygen-related defects as additional emission centers which enhanced the emission intensity greatly (>10x) and shifted the emission to a longer-wavelength region (\u03bb max = 434 nm; chromaticity coordinates: x = 0.174, y = 0.187) with a bluish-white color. The highest emission intensity was obtained when doping 6 mol % Ba 2+ in BPO 4, which has a quantum yield as high as 31%. The luminescent mechanisms of BPO 4 and Ba 2+-doped BPO 4 were discussed in detail according to the existing models for silica-based materials. \u00a9 2006 American Chemical Society.",

The results of XRD indicate that the obtained CeF 3, CeF 3:Tb 3+, and CeF 3:Tb 3+/LaF 3 (core/shell) nanoparticles crystallized well at 200\u00b0C in diethylene glycol (DEG) with a hexagonal structure. The TEM images illustrate that the CeF 3 and CeF 3:Tb 3+ nanoparticles are spherical with a mean diameter of 7 nm. The growth of the LaF 3 shell around the CeF 3:Tb 3+ core nanoparticles resulted in an increase of the average size (11 nm) of the nanopaticles as well as in a broadening of their size distribution. These nanocrystals can be well-dispersed in ethanol to form clear colloidal solutions. The colloidal solutions of CeF 3 and CeF 3:Tb 3+ show the characteristic emission of Ce 3+ 5d-4f (320 nm) and Tb 3+ 5D 4- 7F J (J = 6-3, with 5D 4- 7F 5 green emission at 542 nm as the strongest one) transitions, respectively. The emission intensity and lifetime of the CeF 3:Tb 3+/LaF 3 (core/shell) nanoparticles increased with respect to those of CeF 3:Tb 3+ core particles. This indicates that a significant amount of nonradiative centers existing on the surface of CeF 3:Tb 3+ nanoparticles can be eliminated by the shielding effect of LaF 3 shells. Finally, the energy transfer from Ce 3+ to Tb 3+ was investigated in CeF 3:Tb 3+ nanoparticles in detail. \u00a9 2006 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Narrow band red-emitting A2GeF6:Mn(4+) (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs) phosphors were prepared through a two-step precipitation-cation exchange route using a K2MnF6 precursor as the Mn(4+) source. The phase purity, morphology, and constituent were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) examination. Optical properties were investigated by photoluminescence spectra (PL and PLE) and high-resolution PL. A temperature-dependent PL examination was performed to investigate the electron-phonon coupling emission mechanism of Mn(4+) in these alkali fluorogermanates. The PL data show that both ordered distribution and appropriate distance between Mn(4+) ions are propitious for enhancement of the emission intensity. A resonance emission enhancement (REE) mechanism has been proposed to explain the intensity increment among these products. These phosphors present bright red emission under blue light (467 nm) illumination, among which Cs2GeF6:0.03Mn(4+) exhibits the most excellent optical properties with a quantum yield (QY) of 93%. A WLED (white light-emitting diode) fabricated with blend of commercial YAG:Ce(3+) and this phosphor emits intense warm white light with low color temperature (CCT = 3385 K) and high color rendering index (Ra = 90.5), implying its potential application as red phosphor in WLEDs. \n\nResonance Emission Enhancement (REE) for Narrow Band....

Many characterizations such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were conducted to analyze the phase and structure of as-prepared samples. Photoluminescence (PL) properties illustrated that Ce3+ singly doped BLSO can produce a broad band ranging from 365 to 550 nm upon UV excitation, which overlapped the excitation spectrum of Tb3+ monitored at 550 nm emission. Energy transfer phenomenon from Ce3+ to Tb3+ in this kind of phosphor was demonstrated from the variations of emission spectra and the decrease of Ce3+ fluorescent decay lifetime in Ce3+-Tb3+ co-doped BLSO, based on which the emission color can be tuned from bright blue to green upon UV excitation. The energy transfer mechanism from Ce3+ to Tb3+ was determined to be electric dipole-quadrupole interaction. Moreover, the temperature-dependent PL of representative BLSO:0.18Ce3+,1.00Tb3+ was supplied in this manuscript, which indicated the good thermal stability of this kind of phosphor. The results show that BLSO:Ce3+,Tb3+ phosphors can be as a potential candidate of blue-green component in phosphor-converted UV LEDs.",

        "abstract": "In order to get efficient phosphors used in WLEDs to cover the shortage of red emission, highly saturated rare-earth-free red phosphors MGe4O9:Mn4+ (M = Sr, Ba) have been successfully fabricated by a solid state method at 1100 \u00b0C. The crystal structure properties including the phase purity were analyzed by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Photoluminescence absolute quantum efficiencies as well as lifetimes were utilized to characterize samples. As for the photoluminescence properties, the excitation spectra of samples exhibit two broad absorption bands with peaks at about 300 nm and 430 nm, which could be excited by near-UV/blue LED excitation. The emission spectra exhibit sharp peaks ranging from 600 nm to 700 nm due to the 4Eg \u2192 4A2g transition of Mn4+ ions. The optimal Mn4+ doping concentrations in both the SrGe4O9 and BaGe4O9 host are determined to be 0.5 mol%. The critical energy transfer distances of these phosphors are calculated to be about 19 \u00c5, and the concentration quenching mechanism is proved to be the dipole\u2013dipole interaction. With increasing temperature, the luminescence of MGe4O9:Mn4+ (M = Sr, Ba) phosphors gradually decreases and the BaGe4O9:Mn4+ sample with the quenching temperature (T0.5) of about 180 \u00b0C has better thermal stability than SrGe4O9:Mn4+ with T0.5 of about 100 \u00b0C. Based on a combination of a blue LED chip, YAG:Ce3+ and MGO:0.5%Mn4+ red phosphors, the warm WLED is fabricated to explore its possible application as a warm white light-emitting diode.",

The powder X-ray patterns of all the phases indicate a structural similarity to the end compounds and show smooth variation of structural parameters with composition in the full range. The linear structural evolution of the iso-structural Sr3-mCamB2O6 solid solutions obeying Vegard\u2019s rule has also been examined and verified by Rietveld refinement, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The average bond lengths of the central cations to the coordinating anions and the distortion indexes of the coordination polyhedra are investigated. As a result, the symmetry of the coordination crystal field is found to be higher with increasing Ca content in the solid solutions phosphors, which should be primarily responsible for the continuous blue shift of the emission spectra of Sr2.96-mCamB2O6: 0.04Eu2+ with the growth of m value.",

        "abstract": "Nitride phosphors have drawn much interest because of their outstanding thermal and chemical stability and interesting photoluminescence properties. Currently, it remains a challenge to synthesize these phosphors through a convenient chemical route. Herein we propose a general and convenient strategy based on hydrothermal-ammonolysis reaction to successfully prepare zinc germanium nitride (ZnGeN2) and Mn2+ doped ZnGeN2 phosphors. The crystal structure, composition, morphology, luminescence and reflectance spectra, quantum efficiency, and the temperature-dependent photoluminescence behavior were studied respectively. The phase formation and crystal structure of ZnGeN2 were confirmed from powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. EDX analysis confirmed the actual atomic ratios of Zn/Ge and N/Ge and suggested the presence of Ge vacancy defects in the ZnGeN2 host, which is associated with its yellow emission at 595 nm with a FWHM of 143 nm under UV light excitation. For Mn2+ doped ZnGeN2 phosphor, it exhibits an intense red emission due to the 4T1g \u2192 6A1g transition of Mn2+ ions. The unusual red emission of Mn2+ at the tetrahedral Zn2+ sites is attributed to the strong nephelauxetic effect and crystal field between Mn2+ and the tetrahedrally coordinated N3-. Moreover, the PL intensity of ZnGeN2:Mn2+ phosphors can be enhanced by Mg2+ ions partially substituting for Zn2+ ions in a certain concentration range. The optimal Mn2+ doping concentration in the ZnGeN2 host is 0.4 mol%. The critical energy transfer distance of this phosphor is calculated to be about 27.99 \u00c5 and the concentration quenching mechanism is proved to be the dipole-dipole interaction. With increasing temperature, the luminescence of ZnGeN2:Mn2+ phosphors gradually decreases and the FWHM of the emission band broadens from 54 nm to 75 nm. The corresponding activation energy Ea was reckoned to be 0.395 eV. And the nonradiative transition probability increases with the increasing temperature, finally leading to the lifetime decrease with the increase of the temperature.",

        "abstract": "A series of Eu/Tb/Mn-ion-doped CaCe(PO) (CCPO) phosphors have been prepared via the conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction process. Under UV radiation, the CCPO host presents a broad blue emission band from Ce ions, which are generated during the preparation process because of the formation of deficiency. The Eu-doped CCPO phosphors can exhibit magenta to red-orange emission as a result of the abnormal coexistence of Ce/Ce/Eu and the metal-metal charge-transfer (MMCT) effect between Ce and Eu. When Tb/Mn are doped into the hosts, the samples excited with 300 nm UV light present multicolor emissions due to energy transfer (ET) from the host (Ce) to the activators with increasing activator concentrations. The emitting colors of CCPO:Tb phosphors can be tuned from blue to green, and the CCPO:Mn phosphors can emit red light. The ET mechanism from the host (Ce) to Tb/Mn is demonstrated to be a dipole-quadrapole interaction for Ce \u2192 Tb and an exchange interaction for Ce \u2192 Mn in CCPO:Tb/Mn. Abundant emission colors containing white emission were obtained in the Tb- and Mn-codoped CCPO phosphors through control of the levels of doped Tb and Mn ions. The white-emitted CCPO:Tb/Mn phosphor exhibited excellent thermal stability. The photoluminescence properties have shown that these materials might have potential for UV-pumped white-light-emitting diodes.",

Herein we report a series of single-composition Bi-doped LiCaMgVO garnet-structure phosphors, whose emission colors under n-UV excitation could be tuned from bluish green (480 nm) to yellow (562 nm) on the basis of local lattice distortion and VO \u2192 Bi energy transfer. Furthermore, full-color luminescence tuning from bluish green to orangish red across the warm white light region was successfully achieved by designing VO \u2192 Bi \u2192 Eu energy transfers. More interestingly, the thermal stabilities of as-prepared samples were gradually enhanced through designing VO/Bi \u2192 Eu energy transfers.

Therefore, many researchers have devoted their interest to design phosphors with different emission colors via their energy transfer properties. It is well known that Ce3+ and Bi3+ are good sensitizers, while Mn2+, Dy3+, Eu3+ and Sm3+ can be useful activators. Further, Eu2+ and Tb3+ can be both good sensitizers and activators. Therefore, herein we summarise many recent ET systems consisting of Eu2+\u2013Mn2+/Tb3+, Eu2+\u2013Tb3+\u2013Mn2+/Eu3+/Sm3+, Ce3+\u2013Mn2+/Tb3+/Dy3+/Eu2+, Ce3+\u2013Tb3+\u2013Mn2+/Eu3+/Sm3+, Bi3+\u2013Eu3+/Sm3+ and Tb3+\u2013Eu3+/Sm3+, which show tunable emission color from ultraviolet to blue and green, blue to green, yellow, orange and pink/red, cyan to green, orange and pink/red, and green to yellow/orange and red. Based on this summary, this review will be a good reference to benefit the design and investigation of phosphors potentially applied in FEDs and LEDs with ET.",

        "abstract": "A variety of Ce3+ and Tb3+-doped BaLu2Si3O10 (BLSO) phosphors were synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state reaction method. Many technologies, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), solid-state NMR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements, were used to characterize the as-prepared samples. Lu4Si2O7N2 was generated when N3\u2212 replaced O2\u2212 in BLSO:Ce3+, which resulted in a shift of the emission band from the blue (423 nm) to the cyan (460 nm) region under UV excitation. It was speculated that energy transfer occurred in Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped BLSO via the spectral overlap between Ce3+ emission and Tb3+ excitation in singly-doped BLSO, demonstrated by the variation in the emission spectra and the decrease in the Ce3+ fluorescent lifetimes in Ce3+ and Tb3+ co-doped BLSO, which resulted in a color change from blue to green when the concentration ratio of Ce3+/Tb3+ in BLSO:Ce3+,Tb3+ was adjusted. The energy transfer mechanism was confirmed to be electric dipole\u2013quadrupole interaction. Moreover, quantum yields (QYs), Commission Internationale de lu0027Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates and temperature-dependent PL properties have also been investigated in detail. The results show the potential of BLSO:Ce3+,Tb3+ compounds as candidates for phosphors in phosphor-converted LEDs.",

        "abstract": "In pursuit of highly efficient phosphors for white LED (w-LED) lighting, chemical modification of the host lattice and the design of energy transfer in a variety of cation sites have been extensively considered. In this work, a series of novel Bi3+,Li+,Eu3+-doped BaSc2O4 phosphors with blue-to-red tunable emission were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction process. Charge compensators (Li+) and fluxes (BaF2) were jointly employed to improve the phase purity and luminescence properties of phosphors based on appropriate chemical modifications. The crystal structures were analyzed by XRD and the Rietveld refinement, and the photoluminescence properties and thermal stabilities of the studied phosphors were investigated in detail. BaSc2O4:Bi3+ could be efficiently excited by n-UV light (250\u2013350 nm), and exhibits a bright broad blue emission band (400\u2013520 nm) with a peak at 440 nm. Moreover, the introduction of the Li+ ion and BaF2 could efficiently enhance the emission intensity and decrease thermal quenching, which should be due to the lattice modification. Interestingly, systematic luminescence tuning from blue to red could be achieved by designing Bi3+ \u2192 Eu3+ energy transfer. The corresponding luminescence mechanism was discussed and proposed. In addition, Bi3+,Li+-doped BaSc2O4 phosphors with BaF2 demonstrate good thermal stability, with their emission intensity at 150 \u00b0C still exceeding 70% of the initial RT value. The above results indicate that the BaSc2O4:Bi3+,Li+ phosphor would be a potential blue phosphor for n-UV based w-LEDs devices. Moreover, the controllable emission adjustment from Bi3+,Eu3+-codoped BaSc2O4 phosphors could derive a series of novel phosphor materials for improving the light quality of w-LED sources.",

In this paper, we designed two-dimensional (2D) tunable color coordinates on the CIE diagram in the Eu2+,Mn2+ doped (Ca,Sr)9xSc(PO4)7 system by a combination of crystal field regulation and the energy transfer method. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement were utilized to analyze the phase composition and structural variation of the studied phosphors. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence spectra were exploited to analyze the generation of nanosegregation. The effects of the schedule of cation substitutions and energy transfer on the photoluminescence properties were investigated in detail. The corresponding luminescence mechanisms of the red-shifted emission with Sr2+ \u2192 Ca2+ substitution and Eu2+ \u2192 Mn2+ energy transfer were deeply discussed and proposed. In addition, the temperature-dependent thermal quenching behavior and the electroluminescence (EL) performance of the fabricated w-LED devices were also investigated to characterize the prepared Ca9(1\u22120.03\u2212x\u2212y)Sr9xSc(PO4)7:0.27Eu2+,9yMn2+. Finally, a representative w-LED device composed of a 369 nm UV chip and Ca9(1\u22120.03\u22120.02\u22120.5)Sr4.5Sc(PO4)7:0.27Eu2+,0.18Mn2+ could present excellent EL performance with the parameters CRI = 88, CCT = 3122 K and color coordinate (0.45, 0.44), which could well meet the commercial standard of warm white light. Therefore, our results suggest that this two-step luminescence tuning method is feasible to be applied in other phosphor systems for obtaining efficient white emitting phosphors.",

The CAZO:Eu 3+ /Tb 3+ /Mn 2+  samples emit the orange, blue-green and yellow-green light due to their characteristic f-f and d-d emissions, respectively. Moreover, the Tb 3+  and Mn 2+  codoped CAZO samples give simultaneous emissions of Tb 3+  and Mn 2+ , leading to the emission colors changing from green to yellow. Under UV light excitation, multi-color emissions can be obtained by modifying the relative doping concentration of Tb 3+  and Mn 2+ . More importantly, a near white emission was obtained in CAZO:0.003Tb 3+ , 0.007Mn 2+  samples.",

        "abstract": "Controllable luminescence tuning can modify and improve the luminescence performances of phosphor materials and thus promote their application in white light emitting diodes (W-LEDs). Usually, crystal field modulation by constructing solid solutions based on diverse composition substitutions and energy transfers are effective strategies for adjusting the luminescence properties of phosphors. Herein, we report a series of novel emission-tunable Ba3\u2212xSrxSc4O9:yBi3+,zEu3+ (x = 0\u20133.0, y = 0\u20130.15, z = 0\u20130.30) solid solution phosphors synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state route. The XRD patterns and Rietveld refinements were utilized to confirm the phase purity and analyze the structural variation. Cation substitution-dependent color-tunable evolution as a function of Sr content in Bi3+-doped Ba3\u2212xSrxSc4O9 was observed and investigated in detail. The regular emission red-shift located in the blue-green region with the increase of Sr content was attributed to the combined effect of the crystal field splitting. Due to the suitable optical band gap (5.50 eV), Bi3+ ions realized a highly efficient doping in the Sr3Sc4O9 matrix. The as-prepared Sr3Sc4O9:Bi3+ samples were efficiently excited by UV light, and the photoluminescence properties presented obvious preferential-occupation selected excitation phenomenon where the emission peaks had remarkable red-shifts along with increasing the excitation wavelength. In addition, luminescence tuning from green to orange was achieved by designing the energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+ ions in the as-prepared Sr2.97\u2212zSc4O9:0.03Bi3+,zEu3+ samples and the corresponding mechanism was proposed. Moreover, the thermal stabilities of the studied phosphors were revealed. According to the distortion calculation of the Ba/Sr crystallographic occupation, the thermal stability is related to the lattice rigidity, which would become much stronger with the reduction of distortion. These results illustrate that the as-prepared Ba3\u2212xSrxSc4O9:Bi3+,Eu3+ phosphors can be potential candidates for color-tunable phosphors applied in UV-pumped W-LEDs.",

The powder X-ray patterns of all the phases indicate a structural similarity to the end compounds and show a smooth variation of the structural parameters with composition in the full range. The linear structural evolution of the iso-structural Sr3\u2212mCamB2O6 solid solutions obeying Vegardu0027s rule has also been examined and verified by Rietveld refinement, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The average bond lengths of the central cations to the coordinating anions and the distortion indexes of the coordination polyhedra are investigated. As a result, the symmetry of the coordination crystal field is found to be higher with increasing Ca content in the solid solutions phosphors, which should be primarily responsible for the continuous blue shift of the emission spectra of Sr2.96\u2212mCamB2O6:0.04Eu2+ with the growth of the m value.",

        "abstract": "Designing two-step tuning based on substitution of multiple cation lattices and energy transfer successfully achieved versatile colour output for single-phase phosphor-converted white LEDs in this work. Herein, we chose whitlockite-type Ca9LiY0.667(PO4)7 compound as a host which provides multiple cation sites for Eu2+ occupation. Spectral results indicate that the Ca9LiY0.667(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphor emits a cold white emission due to its multiple emission bands at about 420, 480, and 530 nm, which correspond to emissions from the M(3), M(1)/M(2) and M(5) cation sites as ascertained by the Rietveld refinement method. In order to enhance the red emission of CLYPO:Eu2+ phosphors, they were codoped with Mn2+. Warm white emission in a single-phase host based on energy transfer was successfully obtained in the CLYPO:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphors. The excitation band of the CLYPO:Eu2+,Mn2+ phosphors in the 360 to 450 nm range perfectly coincides with that of commercial LED chips, implying that these phosphors are desirable for white LED applications. White LEDs with a higher color rendering index (Ra = 90.2) and a lower correlated color temperature (CCT = 3614 K) were achieved by using a single-phase CLYPO:0.03Eu2+,0.10Mn2+ phosphor and a 395 nm InGaN-LED chip.",

        "abstract": "Mn4+-activated red phosphors have attracted considerable attention as promising red components in the spectra of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) to achieve warm white light with superior performance. Herein, a novel red phosphor based on Mn4+-doped dodec-fluoride Li3Na3Al2F12:Mn4+ (LNAF:Mn) with microcubic morphology was obtained at room temperature. To elucidate the underlying relationship between the crystal structure and photoluminescence of LNAF:Mn, a phosphor LiNa2AlF6:Mn4+ with similar composition has been prepared, and their morphology and optical properties were comparatively investigated. The emission of the red phosphor LNAF:Mn is blue shifted compared to LiNa2AlF6:Mn4+ suggesting that the chromaticity coordinates of LANF:Mn are closer to the ideal red point (0.67, 0.33). The luminescence properties of LNAF:Mn have been improved by optimizing the synthetic conditions. This work exhibits a strategy to explore a novel Mn4+-doped fluoride except for the identified hexa-fluorides. Employing the as-prepared red LNAF:Mn as a red component, a high-performance WLED with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3874 K and a color rendering index (CRI) of 90.6 was obtained. This suggests the phosphor is a potential commercial red phosphor in warm WLEDs.",

        "abstract": "Various strategies including cation substitution, energy transfer in a variety of cation sites and valence mixing of Eu2+/Eu3+ in a single compound have offered significant advantages in tuning the photoluminescence properties of phosphors for white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs). Herein, we report a series of Eu2+-doped Ca9\u2212xSrxLiGd2/3(PO4)7 solid solution phosphors of the apatite type prepared by a traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction. The crystal field regulation around the Eu2+ ions causes different luminescence behaviors of the two-peak emission and induces photoluminescence tuning as a function of strontium content. In addition to the emission band peak at 423 nm in Ca9LiGd2/3(PO4)2:0.03Eu2+, another broad-band peak at 485\u2013535 nm is observed with Sr2+ substitution, which is attributed to the combined effect of the crystal field splitting and energy transfer between Eu2+ ions. In pursuit of precise color luminescence tuning, we designed the Eu2+ \u2192 Mn2+ energy transfer and studied the cooperative performance of mixed-valent Eu2+/Eu3+ in the solid solution phosphors with different compositions (x = 0, 4.5, 9.0), and the corresponding luminescence mechanisms were proposed and discussed in detail. Finally, a representative W-LED device composed of a 370 nm UV chip and Sr8.75LiGd2/3(PO4)7:0.05Eu2+,0.20Mn2+ sample could present excellent electroluminescence performance with the parameters Ra = 90.4, CCT = 3794 K and color coordinate (0.385, 0.388), which could well meet the commercial standard of warm white light. Therefore, the results suggest that these three luminescence tuning strategies are feasible to be simultaneously applied in other phosphor systems for precise emission tuning and obtaining efficient white emitting phosphors.",

A series of Ca19Mg2(PO4)14 and Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ and/or Tb3+) nanocrystalline phosphors was prepared via a Pechini-type sol\u2013gel process. With UV light excitation, the prepared Ca19Mg2(PO4)14 nanocrystalline phosphors exhibited novel blue luminescence with a broad band from 374 to 600 nm peaking at 439 nm, which is ascribed to the embedded carbon quantum dots. Also, the obtained Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ and/or Tb3+) nanocrystalline phosphors not only exhibited the characteristic broad band emission of the carbon quantum dots, but also the characteristic narrow line emission of the doped rare earth ions, i.e., the characteristic red emission of Eu3+ (5DJ \u2192 7FJ\u2032 transitions, J, J\u2032 = 0, 1, 2, 3) and the characteristic green emission of Tb3+ (5D4 \u2192 7FJ transitions, J = 3, 4, 5, 6). Thus, energy transfer occurred from the carbon quantum dots to the doped Eu3+ and/or Tb3+ ions in the Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ and/or Tb3+) nanocrystalline phosphors. The luminescence color of the Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ and/or Tb3+) nanocrystalline phosphors could be tuned from blue to blue-green, green, white, pink, orange, red, etc. by changing the doping rare-earth ion concentration, species, and relative ratio of Eu3+ to Tb3+ ions. Furthermore, single-phase white-light luminescence was demonstrated in the Eu3+/Tb3+ codoped Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ln3+ nanocrystalline phosphors. Finally, the luminescence properties and mechanisms of the Ca19Mg2(PO4)14 and Ca19Mg2(PO4)14:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu3+ and/or Tb3+) nanocrystalline phosphors were discussed.",

        "abstract": "Highly efficient phosphor materials with superior thermal stability are indispensable for phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) solid state lighting. In order to obtain a high quality warm white light, near-ultraviolet (n-UV) chips combined with trichromatic phosphors have be extensively studied. Among them, the development of efficient blue phosphor remains a challenging task. In view of the close correlation between 5d\u20134f transitions of rare earth ions and the coordination environment of host lattice, many studies have been dedicated to improving the photoluminescence performances by modifying the lattice coordination environment including the lattice rigidity and symmetry. In this work, we reported highly efficient blue-emitting Eu2+-doped BaAl12O19 (BAO) phosphors with excellent thermal stability, which were prepared via the traditional high-temperature solid state reaction routes. According to the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) Rietveld refinement analysis, BAO owned a highly symm...",

        "abstract": "Many efforts have been devoted to exploring novel luminescent materials that not contain expensive or toxic elements, or do not need a mercury vapor plasma source. In this paper, BPO4 and Li+-doped BPO 4 powder samples were prepared by the Pechini-type sol-gel (PSG) process. The structure and optical properties of the resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra, kinetic decay, and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), respectively. It was found that PSG -derived Li+-doped BPO4 annealed at 960 \u00b0C exhibited bright bluish-white emission centered at 416 nm. The luminescence decay curves analysis indicates that each sample has two kinds of lifetimes (5.9 ns and 0.529 ms) and two types of kinetic decay behaviors which can be fitted into a single-exponential function and a double-exponential function, respectively. This can be attributed to two kinds of emission centers in samples. The luminescent mechanisms of the samples are discussed in detail. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "One-dimensional La(9.33)(SiO(4))(6)O(2): Ln(3+) (Ln = Ce, Eu, Tb) microfibers were fabricated by a simple and cost-effective electrospinning method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence (PL) and low voltage cathodoluminescence (CL) as well as kinetic decay were used to characterize the resulting samples. SEM and TEM results indicated that the diameter of the microfibers annealed at 1000 \u00b0C for 3 h was 200-245 nm. The microfibers were further composed of fine and closely linked nanoparticles. La(9.33)(SiO(4))(6)O(2): Ln(3+) (Ln = Ce, Eu, Tb) phosphors showed the characteristic emission of Ce(3+) (5d \u2192 4f), Eu(3+) ((5)D(0)\u2192(7)F(J)) and Tb(3+) ((5)D(3,4)\u2192(7)F(J)) under ultraviolet excitation and low-voltage electron beams (3-5 kV) excitation. An energy transfer from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) was observed in the La(9.33)(SiO(4))(6)O(2): Ce(3+), Tb(3+) phosphor under ultraviolet excitation and low-voltage electron beam excitation. Luminescence mechanisms were proposed to explain the observed phenomena. Blue, red and green emission can be realized in La(9.33)(SiO(4))(6)O(2): Ln(3+) (Ln = Ce, Eu, Tb) microfibers by changing the doping ions. So the La(9.33)(SiO(4))(6)O(2): Ln(3+) (Ln = Ce, Eu, Tb) phosphors have potential applications in full-color field emission displays.",

        "abstract": "Photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) properties of Ln 3+ (Ln = Tb, Dy, Eu, Tm, Ce) and Mn 2+-activated KCaGd(PO 4) 2 (KCG) phosphors were investigated. Under UV excitation, KCG:Tb 3+, KCG:Dy 3+, KCG:Eu 3+, KCG:Tm 3+, and KCG:Mn 2+ samples exhibit the characteristic emission of the activators, respectively. By altering doping activators and adjusting their relative doping concentrations in the KCG host, we obtained white emission in KCG:Tm 3+, Tb 3+, Eu 3+, KCG:Tb 3+, Mn 2+, Eu 3+, KCG:Tb 3+, Eu 3+, and KCG:Dy 3+, Eu 3+ samples under the excitation of 275 or 356 nm UV. Besides, there exist three energy transfer pairs in the KCG host, i.e., Ce 3+ \u2192 Tb 3+, Ce 3+ \u2192 Dy 3+, and Ce 3+ \u2192 Mn 2+. Upon excitation at 280 nm, the absolute quantum yield of the optimized KCG:Ce 3+, Tb 3+ is 90.6%. Under the low-voltage electron beam excitation, the CL properties of KCG:Ln 3+/Mn 2+ phosphors have been investigated in detail, and a variety of colors can be obtained in these samples. All of the results of this study reveal that the as-prepared KCG:Ln 3+/Mn 2+ phosphors have good luminescent intensity under UV and the low-voltage electron beam excitation, especially KCG:Ce 3+, Tb 3+ samples, making these materials have potential applications in white-light LEDs and field emission display devices. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",

        "abstract": "A series of novel color-tunable Ba3Y4O9:Bi(3+),Eu(3+) phosphors were prepared for the first time via the high-temperature solid-state reaction route. The effect of Bi(3+) concentration on the emission intensity of Ba3Y4O9:Bi(3+) was investigated. The emission spectra of the Ba3Y4O9:Bi(3+),Eu(3+) phosphors present both a greenish yellow band of Bi(3+) emission centered at 523 nm, and many characteristic emission lines of Eu(3+), derived from the allowed (3)P1-(1)S0 transition of the Bi(3+) ion and the (5)D0-(7)FJ transition of the Eu(3+) ion, respectively. The energy transfer phenomenon from Bi(3+) to Eu(3+) ions is observed under UV excitation in Bi(3+), Eu(3+) co-doped Ba3Y4O9 phosphors, and their transfer mechanism is demonstrated to be a resonant type via dipole-quadrupole interaction. The critical distance between Bi(3+) and Eu(3+) for the energy transfer effect was calculated via the concentration quenching and spectral overlap methods. Results show that color tuning from greenish yellow to orange red can be realized by adjusting the mole ratio of Bi(3+) and Eu(3+) concentrations based on the principle of energy transfer. Moreover, temperature-dependent PL properties, CIE chromaticity coordinates and quantum yields of Ba3Y4O9:Bi(3+),Eu(3+) phosphors were also supplied. It is illustrated that the as-prepared Ba3Y4O9:Bi(3+),Eu(3+) phosphors can be potential candidates for color-tunable phosphors applied in UV-pumped LEDs.",

        "abstract": "Nitride phosphors have drawn much interest because of their outstanding thermal and chemical stability and interesting photoluminescence properties. Currently, it remains a challenge to synthesize these phosphors through a convenient chemical route. Herein we propose a general and convenient strategy based on hydrothermal-ammonolysis reaction to successfully prepare zinc germanium nitride (ZnGeN2) and Mn2+ doped ZnGeN2 phosphors. The crystal structure, composition, morphology, luminescence and reflectance spectra, quantum efficiency, and the temperature-dependent photoluminescence behavior were studied respectively. The phase formation and crystal structure of ZnGeN2 were confirmed from powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. EDX analysis confirmed the actual atomic ratios of Zn/Ge and N/Ge and suggested the presence of Ge vacancy defects in the ZnGeN2 host, which is associated with its yellow emission at 595 nm with a FWHM of 143 nm under UV light excitation. For Mn2+ doped ZnGeN2 phosphor, it exhibits an intense red emission due to the 4T1g \u2192 6A1g transition of Mn2+ ions. The unusual red emission of Mn2+ at the tetrahedral Zn2+ sites is attributed to the strong nephelauxetic effect and crystal field between Mn2+ and the tetrahedrally coordinated N3\u2212. Moreover, the PL intensity of ZnGeN2:Mn2+ phosphors can be enhanced by Mg2+ ions partially substituting for Zn2+ ions in a certain concentration range. The optimal Mn2+ doping concentration in the ZnGeN2 host is 0.4 mol%. The critical energy transfer distance of this phosphor is calculated to be about 27.99 A and the concentration quenching mechanism is proved to be the dipole\u2013dipole interaction. With increasing temperature, the luminescence of ZnGeN2:Mn2+ phosphors gradually decreases and the FWHM of the emission band broadens from 54 nm to 75 nm. The corresponding activation energy Ea was reckoned to be 0.395 eV. And the nonradiative transition probability increases with the increasing temperature, finally leading to the lifetime decrease with the increase of the temperature.",

        "abstract": "Co-doping of Ce3+/Eu2+, Tb3+, Mn2+ ions into a single-component host is commonly used to achieve white-light phosphors through energy transfer, which present good color stability and high color rendering index (CRI) values. In this work, a series of single-component trichromatic white-light-emitting Ca9Bi(PO4)7(CBPO):Ce3+,Tb3+,Mn2+ phosphors were synthesized and investigated. The crystal structure, luminescence properties and energy transfer behavior are discussed in detail. The energy transfer process from Ce3+ to Tb3+/Mn2+ has been demonstrated to be a resonant type via the dipole\u2013dipole\u2013quadrupole\u2013quadrupole interaction mechanism, respectively, which makes the emission color shift from purple-blue to green/red with the corresponding Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates from (0.166, 0.011) to (0.260, 0.569) and (0.582, 0.287), respectively. Additionally, the white light emission by controlling the concentration ratio of Tb3+ and Mn2+ ions has been acquired in the CBPO:0.08Ce3+,0.22Tb3+,0.11Mn2+ sample with the CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.375, 0.310) and an absolute quantum yield of 50% upon 292 nm excitation. The maximum quantum yield is 84% for CBPO:0.08Ce3+,0.90Tb3+. The good thermal stability of the CBPO:0.08Ce3+,0.22Tb3+,0.11Mn2+ sample shows about 83.6% at 150 \u00b0C of its initial PL intensity at room temperature, which attracts more attention. The results suggest that the present phosphors can be potentially applied as candidates of single-component white-light phosphors for UV-pumped w-LEDs.",

Using X-ray powder diffraction, the structural properties including the phase purity were analyzed through Rietveld analysis. The BZSO:Eu2+ phosphors exhibit a broad excitation band ranging from 200 to 450 nm, and an intense asymmetric green emission band centered at 501 nm under an excitation of 365 nm. The optimum doping concentration of Eu2+ was found for x = 0.03. The detailed energy transfer mechanism among Eu2+ in BZSO is found to be a dipole\u2013dipole mechanism, and the critical distance (RC) for the Eu2+ ions calculated by the concentration quenching and spectral overlap methods are 20.45 and 25.83 \u00c5, respectively. Furthermore, the unexpected blue shift (from green to cyan) in the emission and the increase in the thermal quenching barrier upon cation substitutions (Ca2+/Sr2+ for Ba2+) in the BZSO:0.03Eu2+ system have been investigated, which is due to the variation of the crystal field strength that the 5d orbital of the Eu2+ ion experiences. The underlying mechanism is ascribed to the differences between the average structure and the local coordination environments on the activator ions (Eu2+), as confirmed by the refinement results. Considering the merits of the near-UV light excitation, broad band emission, and good thermal stability, these materials have a potential application as white light emitting diode phosphors.",

        "abstract": "A series of Eu2+,Mn2+-doped Na3LuSi2O7 (NLSO) phosphors have been prepared via the high-temperature solid-state reaction route. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, fluorescent decay times, photoluminescence (PL) including temperature-dependent PL properties and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the as-prepared samples. In Eu2+ singly-doped NLSO samples, an intense green emission is presented under UV excitation. A tunable color from green to yellowish-orange was generated when Mn2+ ions were co-doped into the NLSO:Eu2+, which is based on the energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions. The energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions can be speculated to be due to the wide spectral overlap between the Eu2+ emission and Mn2+ excitation spectra in Eu2+ or Mn2+ singly-doped NLSO samples. This is demonstrated by the similar excitation spectra of the Eu2+ and Mn2+ emission bands and the decreases in Eu2+ emission intensity and decay lifetime with the increase of Mn2+ concentration in the NLSO:Eu2+,Mn2+ samples. The energy transfer mechanism from Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions was determined to be a dipole\u2013quadrupole interaction by the concentration quenching and spectral overlap methods. The maximum quantum yield can reach 51.5% for NLSO:0.01Eu2+,0.12Mn2+. The above results indicate that NLSO:Eu2+,Mn2+ could be a candidate as a green to yellowish-orange component for UV-excited w-LEDs.",

        "abstract": "A series of Bi3+,Eu3+-doped Sr2Y8(SiO4)6O2 (SYSO) phosphors were synthesized by the Pechini-type sol\u2013gel route. XRD patterns, Rietveld refinement, FT-IR spectra, photoluminescence spectra (PL), fluorescence decay time, and quantum yields (QYs) were utilized to characterize the as-prepared samples. Intense blue-green emission due to the 3P1 \u2192 1S0 transition of Bi3+ ions is produced under UV excitation in Bi3+ singly doped SYSO samples. Spectral analysis illustrates that two kinds of Bi3+ ions are generated by occupying the two kinds of sites (4f and 6h) available for Y in SYSO, denoted as Bi3+(1) and Bi3+(2), corresponding to the two main emission bands at around 413 and 493 nm, respectively. A wide spectral overlap between Bi3+ emission and Eu3+ excitation spectra results in the energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+. This has been demonstrated via the excitation spectra monitored at Bi3+ and Eu3+ emission bands, and the PL emission spectra and decay time of Bi3+ in SYSO:Bi3+,Eu3+ phosphors. The energy transfer mechanism is determined to be dipole\u2013quadrupole interaction. The critical distance of energy transfer from Bi3+ to Eu3+ ions is calculated to be 12.78 \u00c5 based on the concentration quenching method, which is in good agreement with that of the spectral overlap route (10.03\u201313.37 \u00c5). Moreover, the QYs, CIE chromaticity and thermal quenching properties have also been investigated. White emission color can be realized with the CIE coordinates (0.325, 0.311) and QY 52% for SYSO:0.08Bi3+,0.48Eu3+. The above results suggest that SYSO:Bi3+,Eu3+ can be a potential single-component white-emitting phosphor for UV w-LEDs.",

        "abstract": "A series of Eu2+ singly doped \u03b1-Ca1.65Sr0.35SiO4:Eu2+ phosphors have been synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) including temperature-dependent PL were used to characterize the as-prepared samples. The XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement of the presented sample show the pure phase of the as-prepared samples. All of the phosphors exhibit intense and broad absorption bands in the ultraviolet and near ultraviolet (n-UV) range, and produce bright green emission upon 365 nm UV radiation. The critical concentration of Eu2+ for the maximum intensity was determined to be about 1 mol% in \u03b1-Ca1.65Sr0.35SiO4:Eu2+ after optimizing the composition. The energy transfer mechanism between Eu2+ was demonstrated to be dipole\u2013dipole interaction. Besides, the fluorescence decay curves, the temperature dependent PL and CIE value of \u03b1-Ca1.65Sr0.35SiO4:Eu2+ phosphors were investigated. It is reasonable that the decay times of samples decrease with increasing Eu2+ content. The CIE chromaticity coordinates shift from green (0.197, 0.395) to the border between the green and yellow (0.242, 0.547) region, which agree with the corresponding emission spectra. The maximum quantum yield is 69% for \u03b1-Ca1.65Sr0.345SiO4:0.005Eu2+. The thermal stability of luminescence of selected \u03b1-Ca1.65Sr0.34SiO4:0.01Eu2+ was also investigated and compared with that of the commercial green phosphor, which shows its good performance. The above results suggest that it is a good candidate for green-emitting phosphors applied in UV/n-UV pumped w-LEDs.",

        "abstract": "Pure Ca2Ba3(PO4)3Cl and rare earth ion (Eu2+/Ce3+/Dy3+/Tb3+) doped Ca2Ba3(PO4)3Cl phosphors with the apatite structure have been prepared via a Pechini-type sol-gel process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and structure refinement, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra, absolute quantum yield, as well as lifetimes were utilized to characterize samples. Under UV light excitation, the undoped Ca2Ba3(PO4)3Cl sample shows broad band photoluminescence centered near 480 nm after being reduced due to the defect structure. Eu2+ and Ce3+ ion doped Ca 2Ba3(PO4)3Cl samples also show broad 5d \u2192 4f transitions with cyan and blue colors and higher quantum yields (72% for Ca2Ba3(PO4)3Cl:0.04Eu 2+; 67% for Ca2Ba3(PO4) 3Cl:0.016Ce3+). For Dy3+ and Tb3+ doped Ca2Ba3(PO4)3Cl samples, they give strong line emissions coming from 4f \u2192 4f transitions. Moreover, the Ce3+ ion can transfer its energy to the Tb3+ ion in the Ca2Ba3(PO4)3Cl host, and the energy transfer mechanism has been demonstrated to be a resonant type, via a dipole-quadrupole interaction. However, under the low voltage electron beam excitation, Tb3+ ion doped Ca2Ba3(PO 4)3Cl samples present different luminescence properties compared with their PL spectra, which is ascribed to the different excitation mechanism. On the basis of the good PL and CL properties of the Ca 2Ba3(PO4)3Cl:A (A = Ce 3+/Eu2+/Tb3+/Dy3+), Ca 2Ba3(PO4)3Cl might be promising for application in solid state lighting and field-emission displays. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A series of Ca 4Y 6(SiO 4) 6O (CYS): Ce 3+/Mn 2+/Tb 3+ oxyapatite phosphors were prepared via high-temperature solid-state reaction. Under UV excitation, there exist dual energy transfers (ET), i.e., Ce 3+\u2192Mn 2+ and Ce 3+\u2192Tb 3+ in the CYS: Ce 3+, Mn 2+, Tb 3+ system and their emitting colors can be adjusted from blue to orange-red via ET of Ce 3+\u2192Mn 2+ and from blue to green via ET of Ce 3+\u2192Tb 3+, respectively. Moreover, a wide-range-tunable white light emission with high quantum yields (13%-30%) were obtained by precisely controlling the contents of Ce 3+, Mn 2+ and Tb 3+ ions. On the other hand, the CL properties of CYS: Ce 3+, Mn 2+, Tb 3+ phosphors have been investigated in detail. The studied results indicate that the as-prepared CYS: Ce 3+, Mn 2+, Tb 3+ phosphors have good CL intensity and CIE color coordinate stability with a color-tunable emission crossing the whole white light region under low-voltage electron beam excitation. In general, the white light with varied hues has been obtained in Ce 3+, Mn 2+, and Tb 3+-triactivated CYS phosphors by utilizing the principle of energy transfer and properly designed activator contents under UV (284, 358 nm) and low-voltage (1-5 kV) electron beam excitation, which make them as a potential single-composition trichromatic white-emitting phosphor. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed that the fibers were composed of the cubic ZnAl 2O 4 phase. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that the ZnAl 2O 4 microfibers annealed at 1000 \u00b0C were composed of some smaller nanoparticles and the diameters of the microfibers were in the range of 140-230 nm. Under the excitation of ultraviolet and low-voltage electron beams (3-5 kV), the ZnAl 2O 4: A 3+ (A = Cr, Eu, Tb) samples showed the emission of the host and the doping ions. The evolution of the optical properties of microfibers with increasing the doping concentration was investigated in detail. Green and red emissions can be realized in ZnAl 2O 4 microfibers by changing the doping ions.

The morphologies of the obtained particles can be adjusted from an octahedron to a hexagonal prism or a cube by changing the solvent volume ratios of ethylenediamine and different capping agent(s), and the mean sizes of the crystals can be changed in a relatively wide range from tens of nanometers to a few micrometers. The growth process and dynamic mechanism were discussed. A series of CaS:xCe3+ nanocrystals were prepared and a small red shift of emission positions was observed from green to yellowish-green with increasing Ce3+ concentration.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence (CL) and decay kinetics were used to characterize the resulting samples. The diameters of the Ca 2Gd 8(SiO 4) 6O 2:Eu 3+ microfibers annealed at 1000 \u00b0C were in the range of 130-210 nm. The width and the thickness of Ca 2Gd 8(SiO 4) 6O 2:Eu 3+ microbelts annealed at 1000 \u00b0C were in the range of 290-500 nm and 110-160 nm, respectively. When the samples were excited by ultraviolet (275 nm), intense red emission from Eu 3+ ions was observed. The charge transfer band of microbelts was broader than microfibers and the peak of charge transfer band moved to lower energy area. Under low-voltage electron beams (3-5 kV) excitation, the Ca 2Gd 8(SiO 4) 6O 2:Eu 3+ microfibers also showed strong red emission. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Sr(3)AlO(4)F:RE(3+) (RE = Tm/Tb, Eu, Ce) phosphors were prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as well as lifetimes were utilized to characterize samples. Under the excitation of UV light, Sr(3)AlO(4)F:Tm(3+), Sr(3)AlO(4)F:Tb(3+), and Sr(3)AlO(4)F:Eu(3+) exhibit the characteristic emissions of Tm(3+) ((1)D(2)\u2192(3)F(4), blue), Tb(3+) ((5)D(4)\u2192(7)F(5), green), and Eu(3+) ((5)D(0)\u2192(7)F(2), red), respectively. By adjusting the doping concentration of Eu(3+) ions in Sr(3)AlO(4)F:0.10Tm(3+), 0.10Tb(3+), zEu(3+), a white emission in a single composition was obtained under the excitation of 360 nm, in which an energy transfer from Tb(3+) to Eu(3+) was observed. For Sr(3)AlO(4)F:Ce(3+),Tb(3+) samples, the energy transfer from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) is efficient and demonstrated to be a resonant type via a dipole-quadrupole interaction by comparing the experimental data and theoretical calculation. Furthermore, the critical distance of the Ce(3+) and Tb(3+) ions has also been calculated to be 9.05 \u00c5. The corresponding luminescence and energy transfer mechanisms have been proposed in detail. These phosphors might be promising for use in near-UV LEDs.",

        "abstract": "Hollow and porous structured GdVO4:Dy3+ spheres were fabricated via a facile self-sacrificing templated method. The large cavity allows them to be used as potential hosts for therapeutic drugs, and the porous feature of the shell allows guest molecules to easily pass through the void space and surrounding environment. The samples show strong yellow-green emission of Dy3+ (485 nm, 4F9/2 \u2192 6H15/2; 575 nm, 4F9/2 \u2192 6H13/2) under UV excitation. The emission intensity of GdVO4:Dy3+ was weakened after encapsulation of anticancer drug (doxorubicin hydrochloride, DOX) and gradually restored with the cumulative released time of DOX. These hollow spheres were nontoxic to HeLa cells, while DOX-loaded samples led to apparent cytotoxicity as a result of the sustained release of DOX. ICP measurement indicates that free toxic Gd ions can hardly dissolate from the matrix. The endocytosis process of DOX-loaded hollow spheres is observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Furthermore, GdVO4:Dy3+ hollow spheres can be used for T 1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. These results implicate that the luminescent GdVO4:Dy3+ spheres with hollow and porous structure are promising platforms for drug storage/release and MR imaging. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize the samples. The experimental results indicated that the use of NaBF4 is indispensable for obtaining LnF3 crystal structures. Furthermore, the organic additive trisodium citrate (Cit ) has an obvious impact on the morphologies of the products to some degree. The possible formation mechanisms for LnF 3 nano-/microcrystals are presented in detail. Additionally, we systematically investigated the luminescence properties of the LnF 3:Eu3+ (Ln = La, Gd, and Lu) samples and found an efficient energy transfer from Gd3+ to Eu3+ in GdF 3:Eu3+. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Nearly monodisperse, homogeneous and well-defined one-dimensional Tb(1-x)(OH)3:xEu3+ (x=0-3 mol%) nanorods have been prepared through hydrothermal method. The size of the Tb(OH)3:Eu3+ rods could be modulated from nano- to micro-scale by using different amount of ammonia solution. They present highly crystallinity in spite of the moderate reaction temperature. Under ultraviolet excitation into the f\u2192f transition of Tb3+ at 382 nm, Tb(OH)3 samples show the characteristic emission of Tb3+ corresponding to 5D4\u21927F6, 5, 4, 3 transitions; whereas Tb(OH)3:Eu3+ samples mainly exhibit the characteristic emission of Eu3+ corresponding to 5D0\u21927F1, 2, 4 transitions due to an efficient energy transfer occurs from Tb3+ to Eu3+. The increase of Eu3+ concentration leads to the increase of the energy transfer efficiency from Tb3+ to Eu3+. The PL colors of Tb(OH)3:xEu3+ phosphors can be easily tuned from green, yellow, orange, to red by changing the doping concentration (x) of Eu3+. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The energy levels of the conduction band and valance band are estimated to be ?3.2 eV and ?6.8 eV by cyclic voltammetry and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra. The ZnS:Mn 2+/ZnS NC emission peak is primarily located at 580 nm under 310 nm light excitation, originating from the charge transition from 4T 1 to 6A 1 within the 3d 5 configuration of the Mn 2+ ion. Based on ZnS:Mn 2+/ZnS NCs as the active layer electroluminescent devices, the emission peak mainly locates at 460 nm with one shoulder emission peaking at 580 nm. The photoluminescence and electroluminescence properties of ZnS:Mn 2+/ZnS NCs are investigated in the viewof charge carrier injection and energy level alignment. \u00a9 2011 American Scientific Publishers.

        "abstract": "One-dimensional La(OH) 3:Ln 3+ (Ln = Yb/Er, Yb/Tm, Yb/Ho) microrods have been successfully synthesized using molten composite-hydroxide (NaOH/KOH) as a solvent. La 2O 3:Ln 3+ nanostructures with retained striplike shape were achieved by a subsequent annealing process. The phase, structure, morphology, and fluorescent properties have been well investigated by various techniques. It is found that the reaction time plays a key role in confining the growth of the microrods. Both La(OH) 3:Ln 3+ and La 2O 3:Ln 3+ nanostructures have rodlike shapes with a typical width of 50-400 nm. The up-conversion (UC) photoluminescence (PL) properties of the samples have been studied in detail. Under 980 nm laser excitation, both La(OH) 3:Ln 3+ and La 2O 3:Ln 3+ microrods exhibit the characteristic emissions of Er 3+, Tm 3+, and Ho 3+ and give green, blue, and blackish green emission colors, respectively. Additionally, the doping concentration of Yb 3+ has been optimized by fixing the Er 3+ concentration. It should be noted that the up-conversion emission of La 2O 3:Er 3+ microrods can be significantly improved in comparison with that of their bulk counterpart under the same excitation conditions. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Monodisperse hexagonal Ln(OH) 3 (Ln = Eu,. Sm) submicrospindles with uniform morphology and size have been successfully synthesized in a large scale via a facile aqueous solution route from the mixture of aqueous solutions Of LnCl 3 and NaOH at 5 \u00b0C without using any surfactant or template. The as-synthesized products are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The SEM and TEM images show that the as-formed Ln(OH) 3 samples have a spindlelike shape with an equatorial diameter of 80-200 nm and a length of 500-900 nm, which are aggregates of even smaller nanoparticles. The self-assembly process via orientation attachment is proposed to interpret the growth process for the submicrospindles. During this process, the concentration of NaOH, synthesis temperature, and reaction time play crucial roles in confining the growth of these submicrospindles. Through calcining the Ln(OH) 3 submicrospindles, the Ln 2O 3 particles with the same morphology could be obtained. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selective area electron diffraction (SAED), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to characterize the samples. In our work, the use of diethylene glycol (DEG) is a crucial factor for the formation of the In 2O 3 phase. CO(NH 2) 2 and a defined amount of water play important roles in the formation of the In 2O 3 with different nanostructures. Detailed formation mechanisms for the In 2O 3 phase have been proposed on the hydrolysis of indium alkoxide complexes at elevated temperature in DEG solutions, and the general growth mechanisms for the In 2O 3 nanostructures have been discussed. Compared with nonaqueous solvothermal synthesis of In 2O 3, we present a simple aqueous synthesis method by combining a hydrothermal process with a polyol method. \u00a9 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Gd 2(WO 4) 3 doped with Eu 3+ or Tb 3+ thin phosphor films with dot patterns have been prepared by a combinational method of sol-gel process and microcontact printing. This process utilizes a PDMS elastomeric mold as the stamp to create heterogeneous pattern on quartz substrates firstly and then combined with a Pechini-type sol-gel process to selectively deposit the luminescent phosphors on hydrophilic regions, in which a Gd 2(WO 4) 3:Ln 3+ (Ln=Eu, Tb) precursor solutions were employed as ink. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as well as low voltage cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were carried out to characterize the obtained samples. Under ultraviolet excitation and low-voltage electron beams excitation, the Gd 2(WO 4) 3:Eu 3+ samples exhibit a strong red emission arising from Eu 3+ 5D 0,1,2- 7F 1,2 transitions, while the Gd 2(WO 4) 3:Tb 3+ samples show the green emission coming from the characteristic emission of Tb 3+ corresponding to 5D 4- 7F 6,5,4,3 transitions. The results show that the patterning of rare earth-doped phosphors through combining microcontact printing with a Pechini-type sol-gel route has potential for field emission displays (FEDs) applications. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Under ultraviolet excitation, the YP 0.8 V 0.2 O 4 :Ln 3+ showed the VO 4 3\u2212 self-emission band at approximately 452 nm and the characteristic emission of doped lanthanide ions (Ln 3+ ). The VO 4 3\u2212 self-emission band decreases when the concentration of lanthanide ion increases, because lanthanide ions acts as activator and receives an efficient energy transfer from VO 4 3\u2212 . Through changing the kinds and concentrations of doped Ln 3+ , the emission colors of the nanophosphor can be tuned in a wide region on CIE color coordinates, making the material have potential application in biolabels.",

        "abstract": "Novel 3D urchin-like NaY(MoO4)2 microarchitectures have been successfully synthesized by a complexing-agent-assisted hydrothermal process followed by a subsequent heat treatment process. The shape and size of the double alkaline rare earth molybdates precursor microstructures can be tuned effectively by controlling the reaction conditions, such as reaction time, the amount of organic additive trisodium citrate (Cit3-), and the kinds of organic additives. The possible formation mechanism for urchin-like microarchitectures has been presented. It is found that the Cit3- organic molecule, acting as the chelating agent and shape modifier, plays a key role in fine-tuning the precursor microstructures. The as-formed precursor could transform into NaY(MoO4)2 with their original urchin-like morphology and slight shrinkage in the size after postannealing process. Under UV and low-voltage electron beam excitation, 5 mol % Eu3+ and 5 mol % Tb3+ doped NaY(MoO4)2 samples exhibit strong red and green emission, corresponding to the characteristic lines of Eu 3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Moreover, the luminescence colors of the Eu3+ and Tb3+ codoped NaY(MoO 4)2 samples can be tuned from red, yellow, and green-yellow to green by simply adjusting the relative doping concentrations of the activator ions under a single wavelength excitation, which might find potential applications in the fields such as light display systems and optoelectronic devices. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Upconversion luminescent \u03b2-NaYF4:Yb3+, Er 3+ nanoparticles (UCNPs) were encapsulated with uniform mesoporous silica shells, which were further modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and cancer-targeting ligand folic acid (FA), resulting in the formation of water-dispersible and biologically functionalized core-shell structured UCNPs@mSiO2 nanoparticles with an overall average size of around 80 nm. The obtained multifunctional nanocomposite spheres can be performed as an anti-cancer drug delivery carrier and applied for cell imaging. It is found that anti-cancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) can be absorbed into UCNPs@mSiO2-PEG/FA nanospheres and released in a pH-sensitive pattern. In vitro cell cytotoxicity tests on cancer cells verified that DOX-loaded UCNPs@mSiO2-PEG/FA nanospheres exhibited greater cytotoxicity with respect to free DOX and DOX-loaded UCNPs@mSiO2-PEG at the same concentrations, owing to the increase of cell uptake of anti-cancer drug delivery vehicles mediated by the FA receptor. Moreover, the upconversion luminescence image of UCNPs@mSiO2-PEG/FA taken up by cells shows green emission under 980 nm infrared laser excitation, making the UCNPs@mSiO2-PEG/FA nanocomposite spheres promising candidates as bioimaging agents. These findings highlight the promise of the highly versatile multifunctional nanoparticles for simultaneous imaging and therapeutic applications. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), low voltage cathodoluminescence (CL) and time-resolved emission spectra as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the resulting samples. The as-obtained precursor samples present fiber-like morphology with uniform size, and Tb(2)(WO(4))(3) and Tb(2)(WO(4))(3):Eu(3+) nanowires were formed after annealing. Under ultraviolet excitation and low-voltage electron beams excitation into WO(4)(2-) and the f-f transition of Tb(3+), the Tb(2)(WO(4))(3) samples show the characteristic emission of Tb(3+) corresponding to (5)D(4)-(7)F(6, 5, 4, 3) transitions due to an efficient energy transfer from WO(4)(2-) to Tb(3+), while Tb(2)(WO(4))(3):Eu(3+) samples mainly exhibit the characteristic emission of Eu(3+) corresponding to (5)D(0)-(7)F(0, 1, 2) transitions due to an energy transfer occurs from WO(4)(2-) and Tb(3+) to Eu(3+). The increase of Eu(3+) concentration leads to the increase of the energy transfer efficiency from Tb(3+) to Eu(3+). The PL color of Tb(2)(WO(4))(3):x mol% Eu(3+) phosphors can be tuned from green to red easily by changing the doping concentration (x) of Eu(3+), making the materials have potential applications in fluorescent lamps and color display fields.",

Core-shell structured NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Yb@mSiO2-polyethylene glycol (abbreviated as UCNPS) nanoparticles loaded with the antitumor drug, doxorubicin (DOX) were incorporated into poly(\u025b-caprolactone) (PCL) and gelatin loaded with antiphlogistic drug, indomethacin (MC) to form nanofibrous fabrics (labeled as MC/UCNPS/DOX) via electrospinning process. The resultant multifunctional spinning pieces can be surgically implanted directly at the tumor site of mice as an orthotopic chemotherapy by controlled-release DOX from mesoporous silicon dioxide (SiO2) and upconversion fluorescence/magnetic resonance dual-model imaging through NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Yb embedded in MC/UCNPS/DOX in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Lanthanide ion (Ln(3+))-based upconversion nano/micromaterials that emit higher-energy visible light when excited by low-energy NIR light have aroused considerable attention in the forefront of materials science and biomedical fields, which stems from their unique optical and chemical properties including minimum photodamage to living organisms, low autofluorescence, high signal-to-noise ratio and detection sensitivity, and high penetration depth in biological or environmental samples. Thus, Ln(3+)-based upconversion materials are rising new stars and are quickly emerging as potential candidates to revolutionize novel biomedical applications. In this review article, we mainly focus on the recent progress in various chemical syntheses of Ln(3+)-based upconversion nanomaterials, with special emphasis on their application in stimuli-response controlled drug release and subsequent therapy. Functional groups that are introduced into the stimuli-responsive system can respond to external triggers, such as pH, temperature, light, and even magnetic fields, which can regulate the movement of the pharmaceutical cargo and release the drug at a desired time and in a desired area. This is crucial to boost drug efficacy in cancer treatment while minimizing the side effects of cytotoxic drugs. Many multifunctional (magnetic/upconversion luminescence and porous) composite materials based on Ln(3+) have been designed for controlled drug delivery and multimodal bioimaging. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities for Ln(3+)-based upconversion materials are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BaYF5:Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal process. SEM and TEM images indicate that the size of the nanocrystals is about 20 nm. Under the excitation of a 980 nm single-wavelength diode laser, BaYF 5:Er3+ nanocrystals give strong green upconversion (UC) emission centered at 523 and 541 nm, which is assigned to 2H 11/2 \u2192 4I15/2 and 4S 3/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transitions of Er 3+, respectively. When Yb3+ is codoped in BaYF 5:Er3+, red emission around 652 nm can be observed in the emission spectrum. This emission can be assigned to the 4F 9/2 \u2192 4I15/2 transition of Er 3+. The intensity ratio of the green luminescence to the red luminescence decreases with increasing Yb3+ concentration in BaYF5:Yb3+, Er3+ nanocrystals. The blue UC emissions of BaYF5:Yb3+, Tm3+ nanocrystals appeared near 464 and 480 nm and are assigned to the 1D2 \u2192 3F4 and 1G4 \u2192 3H6 transitions of Tm3+, respectively. Based on the generation of red, green, and blue emissions, the BaYF5:Yb 3+, Er3+, Tm3+ nanocrystals can produce different colors, including white, by controlling the doping concentration of Yb3+ in the BaYF5 nanocrystals. The BaYF 5:40%Yb3+, 0.5%Er3+, 0.5%Tm3+ nanocrystals show proper intensities of blue, green, and red emissions, which result in the production of white light (CIE: x = 0.346, y = 0.336).",

Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), particularly lanthanide (Ln)-based NPs have been regarded as an ideal building block for constructing multimodal bioprobes due to their fascinating properties. In this review, we first summarize recent advances in the optimizations of existing UCNPs. In particular, we highlight the applications of Ln-based UCNPs for multimodal cancer imaging in vitro and in vivo. The explorations of UCNPs-based multimodal nanoprobes for targeting diagnosis and imaging-guided therapeutics are also presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of Ln-based UCNPs in this rapid growing field are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The combination of multi-theranostic modes in a controlled fashion has received tremendous attention for the construction of cooperative therapeutic systems in nanomedicine. Herein, we have synthesized a smart magnetically targeted nanocarrier system, Cu9S5@mSiO2@Fe3O4-PEG (labelled as CMF), which integrates NIR triggered photothermal therapy, pH/NIR-responsive chemotherapy and MR imaging into one nanoplatform to enhance the therapeutic efficacy. This new multifunctional paradigm has a uniform and monodisperse sesame ball-like structure by decorating tiny Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of Cu9S5@mSiO2 before a further PEG modification to improve its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility. With doxorubicin (DOX) payload, the as-obtained CMF-DOX composites can simultaneously provide an intense heating effect and enhanced DOX release upon 980 nm NIR light exposure, achieving a combined chemo/photothermal therapy. Under the influence of an external magnetic field, the magnetically targeted synergistic therapeutic effect of CMF-DOX can lead to highly superior inhibition of animal H22 tumor in vivo when compared to any of the single approaches alone. The results revealed that this Cu9S5 based magnetically targeted chemo/photothermal synergistic nanocarrier system has great promise in future MR imaging assisted tumor targeted therapy of cancer.",

        "abstract": "Combining the multi-modal medical imaging with cancer therapy in one single system has attracted the great interests for theranostic purpose. In this paper, CaF2:Yb3+/Er3+/Mn2+-poly(2-Aminoethyl methacrylate) (UCHNs-PAMA) hybrid microspheres were successfully fabricated. The synthetic route to the nanocomposite based on a facile hydrothermal method for fabrication of hollow upconversion (UC) nanospheres at first and then post-\ufb01lling the PAMA interiorly through photo-initiated polymerization. The UCHNs showed orange \ufb02uorescence under 980 nm near infrared (NIR) laser excitation, which provided the upconverting luminescence (UCL) imaging modality. Meanwhile, the presence of functional Mn2+ and Yb3+ offered the enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, respectively. Thanks to introducing amine groups-containing PAMA inside the hollow nanospheres, the Pt(IV) pro-drug, c,c,t-Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OOCCH2CH2COOH)2 (DSP), can be conveniently bonded on the polymer network to construct a nanoscale anti-cancer drug carrier. The UCHNs-PAMA-Pt(IV) nanocomposite shows effective inhibition for Hela cell line via MTT assay. In contrast, Pt(IV) pro-drug and UCHNs-PAMA microspheres behave little cytotoxicity to Hela cells. This should be attributed the fact that the anti-cancer ability can be recovered only when Pt(IV) pro-drug was reduced to Pt(II)-drug in cellular environment. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments on small mice also confirm that the hybrid microspheres have relatively low toxic side effects and high tumor inhibition rate. These findings show that the multifunctional hybrid microspheres have potential to be used as UCL/MR/CT tri-modal imaging contrast agent and anti-cancer drug carriers.",

        "abstract": "The current near-infrared (NIR) light-induced photodynamic therapy (PDT) can enhance the tissue penetration depth to trigger photosensitizers (PSs) far from the surface. NIR-mediated PDT is still challenged by overheating effect on normal tissues, limited tumor selectivity and low reactive oxygen species (ROS) yields. Here we construct a dual-agent photosensitizing nanoplatform by combining UV-blue upconversion emitting NaYF4:Yb/Tm@NaYF4:Yb@NaNdF4:Yb@NaYF4 (labeled as UCNPs) multi-shell nanocrystals with titanium dioxide (TiO2, UV-light-excited PS) and hypocrellin A (HA, blue-light-excited PS), which can induce cancer cell apoptosis by 808\u00a0nm light-triggered and hyaluronic acid (Hyal)-targeted PDT. In this construction strategy, the crystallized TiO2 shells on the surface of UCNPs can play dual roles as UV-light excited PS and conjugation site for Hyal, and then Hyal is served as targeting-ligand as well as the carrier of HA simultaneously. The step-by-step reactive mode of loading PSs and modifying targeting-ligands is a controllable and ordered design based on the use of one intermediate product as the reaction site for the next component. The Nd(3+)-sensitized UCNPs with quenching reduction layer can efficiently convert 808\u00a0nm NIR light to UV-blue emission for simultaneous activation of two PSs with enhanced intracellular ROS generation. Through the in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiment results, the dual-photosensitizers nanoplatform presents enhanced anti-tumor efficacy by effective targeting cellular uptake and taking full advantage of upconversion emission, which may make a major step toward next generation of NIR-mediated PDT.

The anticancer drug DOX can be absorbed into mesoporous layer of MnFe2O4@mSiO2 nanocomposite, which shows obvious photothermal/chemo dual-modal synergistic therapies triggered by NIR/pH. Under 808 nm irradiation, MnFe2O4 can transform light into thermo, which can not only ablate tumor cells directly but also promote chemotherapy drugs releasing from mesoporous layer to kill tumor cells. The lower pH can also promote DOX releasing from mesoporous layer to enhance tumor inhibitory effect. It is confirmed that biocompatible DOX-MnFe2O4@mSiO2 nanocomposites can act as a potential multifunctional platform for effective magnetic targeting photothermal/chemo dual-modal synergistic therapies with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and T1/T2-weighted dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications in vivo.",

The NIR control in these cancer therapy systems is considered crucial to boost local effective tumor suppression while minimizing side effects, resulting in improved therapeutic efficacy. Some researchers even predict the NIR-triggered cancer therapy to be a new and exciting possibility for clinical nanomedicine applications. In this review, the rapid development of NIR light-responsive cancer therapy based on various smartly designed nanocomposites for deep tumor treatments is introduced. In detail, the use of NIR-sensitive materials for chemotherapy, PTT as well as PDT is highlighted, and the associated challenges and potential solutions are discussed. The applications of NIR-sensitive cancer therapy modalities summarized here can highlight their potential use as promising nanoagents for deep tumor therapy.",

Benefiting from the enhanced 808 nm-excited UCL intensity of the multilayer UCNPs, the unique photothermal properties of CuS and the pH-responsive drug release capacity of the PAA shell, such a nanoplatform design of UCNPs-CuS@PAA (labeled UCP) offers a new route to achieve 808 nm-excited UCL imaging guided chemo/photothermal combination therapy. We have found that the combined chemo/photothermal therapy can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy compared with chemotherapy or photothermal therapy (PTT) alone. Moreover, the pH/NIR-dependent drug delivery properties, 808 nm-excited UCL imaging, as well as in vitro/in vivo biocompatibility tests were also investigated in detail. These results show promising applications of UCP nanoparticles as a novel theranostic agent for the detection and treatment of tumors. ",

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO ) has been widely investigated and used in many areas due to its high refractive index and ultraviolet light absorption, but the lack of absorption in the visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) region limits its application. Herein, multifunctional Fe@\u03b3-Fe O @H-TiO nanocomposites (NCs) with multilayer-structure are synthesized by one-step hydrogen reduction, which show remarkably improved magnetic and photoconversion effects as a promising generalists for photocatalysis, bioimaging, and photothermal therapy (PTT). Hydrogenation is used to turn white TiO in to hydrogenated TiO (H-TiO ), thus improving the absorption in the Vis-NIR region. Based on the excellent solar-driven photocatalytic activities of the H-TiO shell, the Fe@\u03b3-Fe O magnetic core is introduced to make it convenient for separating and recovering the catalytic agents. More importantly, Fe@\u03b3-Fe O @H-TiO NCs show enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency due to more circuit loops for electron transitions between H-TiO and \u03b3-Fe O , and the electronic structures of Fe@\u03b3-Fe O @H-TiO NCs are calculated using the Vienna ab initio simulation package based on the density functional theory to account for the results. The reported core-shell NCs can serve as an NIR-responsive photothermal agent for magnetic-targeted photothermal therapy and as a multimodal imaging probe for cancer including infrared photothermal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and photoacoustic imaging.",

        "abstract": "Photoinduced reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization generally adopts high-energy ultraviolet (UV) or blue light. In combination with photoredox catalyst, the excitation light wavelength was extended to the visible and even near-infrared (NIR) region for photoinduced electron transfer RAFT polymerization. In this report, we introduce for the first time a surface NIR-light-initiated RAFT polymerization on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) without adding any photocatalyst and construct a functional inorganic core/polymer shell nanohybrid for application in cancer theranostics. The multilayer core-shell UCNPs (NaYF:Yb/Tm@NaYbF:Gd@NaNdF:Yb@NaYF), with surface anchorings of chain transfer agents, can serve as efficient NIR-to-UV light transducers for initiating the RAFT polymerization. A hierarchical double block copolymer brush, consisting of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(oligo(ethylene oxide)methacrylate-co-2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethyl methacrylate) (PEG for short), was grafted from the surface in sequence. The targeting arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptide was modified at the end of the copolymer through the trithiolcarbonate end group. After loading of doxorubicin, the UCNPs@PAA-b-PEG-RGD exhibited an enhanced U87MG cancer cell uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity. Besides, the unique upconversion luminescence of the nanohybrids was used for the autofluoresence-free cell imaging and labeling. Therefore, our strategy verified that UCNPs could efficiently activate RAFT polymerization by NIR photoirradiation and construct the complex nanohybrids, exhibiting prospective biomedical applications due to the low phototoxicity and deep penetration of NIR light.",

        "abstract": "Combining multi-model treatments within one single system has attracted great interest for the purpose of synergistic therapy. In this paper, hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNs) coated with a temperature-sensitive polymer, poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) methacrylate-co-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate) (p(OEGMA-co-MEMA)), co-loaded with DOX and a photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) were successfully synthesized. As high as 58% DOX and 6% Ce6 by weight could be loaded onto the HAuNs-p(OEGMA-co-MEMA) nanocomposites. The grafting polymer brushes outside the HAuNs play the role of \u201cgate molecules\u201d for controlled drug release by 650 nm laser radiation owing to the temperature-sensitive property of the polymer and the photothermal effect of HAuNs. The HAuNs-p(OEGMA-co-MEMA)-Ce6-DOX nanocomposites with 650 nm laser radiation show effective inhibition of cancer cells in vitro and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. In contrast, control groups without laser radiation show little cytotoxicity. The nanocomposite demonstrates a way of \u201ckilling three birds with one stone\u201d, that is, chemotherapy, photothermal and photodynamic therapy are triggered simultaneously by the 650 nm laser stimulation.

TD, a kind of phase change molecule with a melting temperature (Tm) of 39 \u00b0C, acts as a gatekeeper to control DOX release. Cu9S5 is a kind of good photothermal agent and has the advantage of a high photothermal conversion efficiency, which has a thermal effect on TD. Cu9S5 NCs at a concentration of 312.5 ppm can elevate its temperature by 28.6 \u00b0C in 5 min when the system is irradiated by a 980 nm laser (0.5 W cm\u22122). When the temperature of the system is higher than 39 \u00b0C, TD can melt and DOX will release from the pores. Besides NIR-triggered release, the DOX release is also controlled by pH. Synergistic NIR-triggered and pH-triggered DOX release prevents the premature release of drug molecules (u003c4% of the whole loaded DOX in 24 h) in neutral conditions without irradiation. However, upon irradiation in acidic conditions (pH = 5.0), the release of the whole loaded DOX could reach 32.6%. Therefore, this versatile combination of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy makes the application of multifunctional drug delivery systems possible.",

        "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) light induced phototherapy has attracted considerable attention due to its deep therapeutic depth. To improve the therapeutic outcome and address non-selective side effects, the combination of complementary phototherapeutic strategies in a single nanoagent with precise targeting ability may provide an effective approach for cancer therapy. Thus we have developed an 808 nm NIR light triggered nanosystem based on IR806 dye functionalized MnFeO (MFO-IR) for synchronous magnetic targeted and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guided in vivo photodynamic/photothermal synergistic therapy. In this construction strategy, carboxylic acid functionalized NIR dye IR806 is explored as an 808 nm NIR-excited photosensitizer (PS) for the first time, which can also provide a conjugation site for MnFeO nanoparticles (MFO NPs). Here, monodisperse MFO NPs have multiple capacities as dye carriers, targeting ligands, MRI contrast agents and photothermal agents. MFO-IR nanocomposites (NCs) with negligible toxicity present efficient NIR-mediated photothermal damage and ROS cytotoxicity via the relevant in vitro experimental investigations. With ideal magnetic targeting effects and remarkable NIR light-responsive properties, these MFO-IR NCs exhibit high in vivo tumor localization and could destroy subcutaneous solid tumors completely under an external magnetic field and 808 nm laser irradiation. Consequently, this magnetic nanosystem has great potential for simultaneous diagnosis and precise cancer phototherapy.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) light, as a powerful means of external stimulus, has attracted widespread attention in the field of tumor research. On one hand, NIR light-excited rare earth upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have presented unique features in multimodal bioimaging, energy conversion and photocontrolled drug delivery. On the other hand, NIR-light-triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is a minimally invasive approach in the fight against tumors, owing to its high spatial resolution, economic viability and improved target selectivity. Thus, the marrying of UCNPs and NIR photothermal agents could open new avenues in the construction of theranostic nanoplatforms. This review primarily focuses on the new advances in the design and the therapeutic applications of multifunctional UCNPs-NIR absorber nanoplatforms. The future challenges and prospects in this field are also addressed.",

Here, highly luminescent perovskite\u2013polystyrene composite beads with uniform morphology are prepared via a simple swelling\u2013shrinking strategy. This process is carried out only in nonpolar toluene and hexane without the addition of any polar reagents. As a result, the as-prepared composite beads not only retain high luminescence but also exhibit superior water-resistant property. The composites emit strong luminescence after being immersed into water over nine months. Moreover, even in some harsh environments such as acid/alkali aqueous solution, phosphate buffer solution, and Dulbeccou0027s modified eagle medium biological buffers, they still preserve high luminescence. The applications in light-emitting diodes and cellular labeling agents are also carried out to demonstrate their ultrastability.",

        "abstract": "With multiphoton excited upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as energy transducer, ultraviolet (UV) light responsive titanium dioxide (TiO2) can be triggered indirectly by near infrared (NIR) light for deep-tissue photodynamic therapy (PDT) through the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy. Compared to pristine TiO2, absorption of hydrogenated black TiO2 (H-TiO2) in visible (Vis) and NIR regions presents a marked improvement in performance, which leads H-TiO2 to enhance its overall activity. Owing to the light absorption enhancement, the single component H-TiO2 can be served as Vis-driven photosensitizers (PSs) for PDT as well as NIR-triggered photothermal agents (PTAs) for photothermal therapy (PTT) simultaneously. Herein, H-TiO2 decorated Nd3+-sensitized-UCNPs (Nd:UCNPs@H-TiO2) nanocomposites (NCs) were synthesized by Nd:Y3Al5O12 (Nd:YAG) pulsed-laser irradiation of Nd:UCNPs@TiO2 precursors in suspended aqueous solution.

        "abstract": "Recently, near-infrared (NIR) light responsive drug delivery systems have attracted much attention for tumor therapy. Herein, we have successfully constructed a smart nanocarrier system Cu9S5-PEI-DNA-DOX (labelled as CPD-DOX) based on the self-assembly of hydrophobic Cu9S5 nanoparticles (NPs), poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segments and the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). Among them, Cu9S5 NPs can serve as a nano-transducer for absorbing and converting near-infrared light to heat. Then, the hydrophobic layer of Cu9S5 NPs is coated with the dendritic polymer PEI through a simple approach. According to the temperature of the tumor tissue and the photothermal effect of Cu9S5 NPs, we specially designed a DNA sequence with a suitable melting temperature for NIR-light-promoted denaturation of DNA helices and drug release when DOX intercalated into the dsDNA through noncovalent interaction. Notably, the DOX-loaded dsDNA can be decorated on the surface of Cu9S5 NPs by convenient electrostatic adsorption rather than chemical bonding. The experimental results show that dsDNA can maintain a stable helical structure under physiological conditions but unzip the helix to release DOX upon NIR irradiation. Therefore, DOX can be safely delivered and released into cancer cells to exert anticancer effects. Based on in vitro cell cytotoxicity experiments, the CPD-DOX system has a synergistic effect for cancer cell apoptosis or death because of both the cytotoxicity of light-triggered DOX release and the Cu9S5-NP-mediated photothermal ablation effect. It is expected that the facile synthesis and low cost nanocarrier can improve the anticancer effect in contrast to the single chemotherapy or photothermal therapy mode.",

        "abstract": "Reported immunoadjuvants still have many limitations, such as inferior cellular uptake capacity and biocompatibility, overly large particle sizes, single function, and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, large-pore mesoporous-silica-coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCMSs) with a size of less than 100 nm are successfully prepared by a typical silica sol-gel reaction using mesitylene as a pore-swelling agent and are applied as a novel immunoadjuvant. The obtained UCMSs not only show significantly higher loadings for the photosensitizers merocyanine 540 (MC540), model proteins (chicken ovalbumin (OVA)), and tumor antigens (tumor cell fragment (TF)), but also are successfully employed for highly efficient in vivo vaccine delivery. The prepared UCMSs-MC540-OVA under 980 nm near-infrared irradiation shows the best synergistic immunopotentiation action, verified by the strongest Th1 and Th2 immune responses and the highest frequency of CD4 , CD8 , and effector-memory T cells. Additionally, nanovaccines UCMSs-MC540-TF can more effectively inhibit tumor growth and increase the survival of colon cancer (CT26)-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice compared with either photodynamic therapy or immunological therapy alone, suggesting the enhanced immunotherapy efficacy and clinical potential of UCMSs as immunoadjuvants for cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E is a valuable marker in cancer prognostics in many human cancers. Silencing eIF4E via delivery of siRNA may be able to overcome chemoresistance. Cisplatin, used as a first-line anti-cancer reagent, has been widely accepted for its great success in clinical applications but it is restricted due to severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and hearing loss. Moreover, platinum drug resistance is a major obstacle to its use. Platinum(iv) prodrugs (denoted as Pt(iv)) which could be reduced to Pt(ii) by various reductants, including mercaptan and glutathione, within cancer cells have very limited toxicity and might overcome platinum resistance because of their chemical inertness. Moreover, combinational therapies that could sensitize the cancer cells to Pt drugs have received great attention nowadays around the world. Here we report a simple and effective upconversion nanoparticle carrier system loaded with both eIF4E siRNA and Pt(iv). We find that this theranostic system could sensitize laryngeal cancer cells to cisplatin based chemotherapy and allow bioimaging both in vitro and in vivo.",

Cisplatin mediates activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), which triggers oxygen (O2) to superoxide radical (O2\u2022\u2013) and its downstream H2O2. Through the Fenton\u2019s reaction, H2O2 could be catalyzed by Fe2+/Fe3+ to the toxic hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), which cause oxidative damages to lipids, proteins, and DNA. By taking the full advantage of Fenton\u2019s chemistry, we herein demonstrated tumor site-specific conversion of ROS generation induced by released cisplatin and Fe2+/Fe3+ from iron-oxide nanocarriers with cisplatin(IV) prodrugs for enhanced anticancer activity but minimized systemic toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Platinum-based drugs cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are widely used in the clinical treatment of cancer. However, the clinical applications of platinum-based drugs are greatly limited by the side-effects, lack of selectivity, fast blood clearance, and intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. In this study, we report an anticancer drug delivery system based on phenanthriplatin(iv) (Phen-Pt(iv))-conjugated NaGdF:Yb/Er nanoparticles. The upconversion luminescent NaGdF:Yb/Er nanoparticles (UCNPs) were further modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and the cancer targeting ligand arginine-glycine-aspartic peptide (RGD), resulting in the formation of water-dispersible and biologically functionalized UCNP@PEI-Phen-Pt-PEG-RGD nanoparticles. The Phen-Pt-conjugated UCNP@PEI-Phen-Pt-PEG-RGD nanoparticles exhibited an obvious cytotoxic effect on Hep-2 cells (Human Laryngeal Carcinoma cell line) via MTT assay. Meanwhile, the endocytosis process of Phen-Pt-conjugated NaGdF:Yb/Er nanoparticles by Hep-2 cells was demonstrated through flow cytometry and ICP-MS. In addition, the upconversion luminescence image of UCNP@PEI-Phen-Pt-PEG-RGD taken up by cells shows green emission under 980 nm infrared laser excitation, making the UCNP@PEI-Phen-Pt-PEG-RGD nanocomposites promising candidates as bioimaging agents. Moreover, these UCNPs were further explored for in vitro and in vivo T-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The in vivo experiments on mice also confirmed that the Phen-Pt(iv)-conjugated nanoparticles have a relatively high tumor inhibition rate. These results indicate that the multifunctional nanoparticles can be expected to be a platform for simultaneous imaging and cancer therapeutic applications.",

Furthermore, cancer targeting ligand folic acid (FA) was modified through the abundant amino groups on the chitosan polymer shell. The nanospheres with a Gd2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ core can be candidates for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. The CS decorated nanocomposites showing good biocompatibility and red emission under 980 nm laser excitation can be potential candidates for bioimaging in vitro. FA modified nanospheres loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) show higher cytotoxicity for HeLa cells in vitro compared with those nanoparticles with chitosan shells only and pure DOX.

        "abstract": "Beyond the unprecedented success achieved in photovoltaics (PVs), lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have shown great potential in other optoelectronic devices. Among them, nanometer-scale perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with fascinating optical properties including high brightness, tunable emission wavelength, high color purity, and high defect tolerance have been regarded as promising alternative down-conversion materials in phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) for lighting and next-generation of display technology. Despite the promising applications of perovskite materials in various fields, they have received strong criticism for the lack of stability. The poor stability has also attracted much attention. Within a few years, numerous strategies towards enhancing the stability have been developed. This review summarizes the mechanisms of intrinsic- and extrinsic-environment-induced decomposition of PQDs. Simultaneously, the strategies for improving the stability of PQDs are reviewed in detail, which can be classified into four types: (1) compositional engineering; (2) surface engineering; (3) matrix encapsulation; (4) device encapsulation. Finally, the challenges for applying PQDs in pc-LEDs are highlighted, and some possible solutions to improve the stability of PQDs together with suggestions for further improving the performance of pc-LEDs as well as the device lifetime are provided.",

        "abstract": "Red-emitting phosphors are indispensable compounds which are used to achieve a warm white light in phosphor-converted white light emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs). However, the luminous efficiency and stability of red phosphors are still big challenges. In this work, we developed red-emitting double perovskite phosphors La2ATiO6:Bi3+,Mn4+ (A = Mg, Zn) (LAT:Bi3+,Mn4+) and discuss the relationship between the double perovskite phosphor structure and the luminescence performance in detail. According to the Rietveld refinement results for the La2Mg(1\u2212w)ZnwTiO6:Bi3+,Mn4+ (0 \u2264 w \u2264 1) (LM(1\u2212w)ZwT:Bi3+,Mn4+) solid solution, the proposed mechanism of the spectral adjustment is ascribed to the appearance of the phase transition, which results in a lower local structural symmetry of the [LaO12] polyhedron and the variation of the crystal field environment for Mn4+. Notably, this is the first time that the influence of the local structure variation on the luminescence tuning in double perovskite structure phosphors has been revealed, and this could offer guidance for the development of new phosphor system. By designing Mg2+/Zn2+ cation substitution, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is remarkably enhanced beyond 20%. In addition, we succeeded in achieving a Bi3+/Mn4+ co-doped energy transfer in the double perovskite structure phosphors. Owing to the Bi3+ \u2192 Mn4+ energy transfer in LAT, the red emission of the Mn4+ ions could be dramatically enhanced. The energy transfer efficiency of LAT:Bi3+,Mn4+ eventually exceeded 90%. The IQE and the thermal stability were all enhanced by around 30% compared to the non-co-doped samples, respectively. These results indicate that the Bi3+ \u2192 Mn4+ energy transfer strategy could play a pivotal role in the development of highly efficient red-emitting phosphors.

        "abstract": "Tumor therapy is facing great challenges in improving drug efficiency while reducing side effects. Herein, a novel multifunctional nanodrug carrier UC@mSiO2-RB@ZIF-O2-DOX-PEGFA (URODF) that combines oxygen (O2)-enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) with pH-responsive chemotherapy is presented. Eight hundred eight nanometer NIR light-irradiated NaYF4:Yb/Er@NaYbF4:Nd@NaGdF4 nanoparticles (UC) were employed as both upconversion/magnetic resonance imaging matrix and motivator for photosensitizer in PDT with deep penetration depth. Mesoporous silica shell (mSiO2) was used as the carrier for photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Zeolitic imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90) was coated outside of mSiO2 as O2 reservoir to quickly release O2 in tumor microenvironment and alleviate tumor hypoxia for enhanced PDT. Doxorubicin (DOX) and NH2-poly(ethylene glycol) modified folic acid (PEGFA) were covalently conjugated on the surface of nanoparticles for synergetic therapy. The drug-loading capacity reaches 5.6 and 6.0% for RB a...",

Herein, polydopamine (PDA)-shelled NaYF:Yb,Er@NaYF:Yb nanoparticles (UCNPs) capable of loading indocyanine green (ICG) molecules via electrostatic adsorption, hydrophobic interaction and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking were successfully designed and synthesized (UCNPs@PDA-ICG, denoted as UPI) for upconversion imaging and combined photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) with enhanced antitumor efficacy. We have found that ICG in this novel anticancer nanoplatform can be triggered impressively by 808-nm irradiation to produce both a photothermal effect and cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus achieving a good PTT/PDT synergistic effect. Notably, compared with free ICG molecules, UPI nanocomposites show much higher photostability and thermal stability. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that the as-obtained UPI can ablate cancer cells effectively with 808-nm irradiation, revealing their great potential as a NIR-mediated dual-modal therapeutic platform. Meanwhile, the core of UCNPs can be used for UCL imaging. All these results demonstrate great potentiality of UPI as a novel type of theranostic agent for the treatment of tumors.",

        "abstract": "Here, a one-pot in situ strategy is adopted to directly grow uniform perovskite nanocrystals on exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN NSs). Such a nanohybrid structure shows excellent thermal conductivity, and it could timely dissipate excess heat. As a consequence, superior thermal stability is achieved, with the photoluminescence emission intensity at 120 \u00b0C still maintaining 80% of the initial intensity at 25 \u00b0C (nearly 6 times that of pure perovskite NCs). This result presents the highest thermal stability ever reported in inorganic composites based on all-inorganic lead halide perovskite materials, which provides a new opportunity for CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs to find promising applications in perovskite NC-based optoelectronic devices such as white light emitting diode (LED) devices.",

The knowledge about their optical stability in aqueous solution under different pH and temperature conditions has not been comprehensively explored. Here we conduct a systematic investigation and report the emission stability and reversibility of typical NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals and their core\u2013shell nanostructures in aqueous solution at different temperatures and with different pH values. These nanocrystals show reversible luminescence response to temperature changes, while low pH permanently quenches their luminescence. With the addition of inert shells, with thicknesses ranging from 1.5 nm to 8 nm, the emission stability and reversibility change significantly. Thicker inert shells not only lead to a significant enhancement in the emission intensity but also stabilize its optical responses which become less affected by temperature variations and pH conditions. This study suggests that upconversion nanocrystal-based sensitive temperature and pH sensors do not generally benefit from the core\u2013shell structure usually recommended for enhanced upconversion luminescence.",

Pluronic P123 and N-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used as co-surfactants to generate porous structure of the nanofibers. N(2) adsorption-desorption measurement reveals that the MBGNF:Eu(3+) have a surface area of 188 m(2) g(-1), a pore volume of 0.246 cm(3) g(-1) and average pore size of 4.17 nm, and the MBGNF:Tb(3+) have a surface area of 171 m(2) g(-1), a pore volume of 0.186 cm(3) g(-1) and average pore size of 3.65 nm. Photoluminescence measurements reveal that the MBGNF:Eu(3+) show strong red emission dominated by the (5)D(0)\u2192(7)F(2) transition of Eu(3+) at 614 nm with a lifetime of 1.356 ms, and MBGNF:Tb(3+) show strong green emission dominated by the (5)D(4)\u2192(7)F(5) transition of Tb(3+) at 544 nm with a lifetime of 1.982 ms. The biocompatibility tests on L929 fibroblast cells using MTT assay reveal low cytotoxicity of MBGNF. These luminescent nanofibers show sustained release properties for ibuprofen (IBU) in vitro. The emission intensities of Eu(3+) in the drug delivery system vary with the released amount of IBU, thus making the drug release be easily tracked and monitored by the change of the luminescence intensity.",

Our lab has recently developed an on-chip device based on Si waveguides, coined a nanophotonic standing-wave array trap (nSWAT), which allows for controlled and precise manipulation of trapped nano/micro particles [1]. Here, we report on our next generation nSWAT devices. By employing Si3N4 waveguides to form an nSWAT, we demonstrate precision manipulation using a 1064 nm laser. This allows for high power applications with minimal heating to the sample plane, decreased optical loss, and considerable smaller nonlinear effects. Our Si3N4 nSWAT represents an important step towards enabling a variety of high throughput, precision single-molecule biological experiments.[1] M. Soltani, J. Lin, R. A. Forties, J. T. Inman, S. N.

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an alternative treatment of cancers. However, the therapeutic efficiency of PDT is severely limited by the microenvironment of insufficient oxygen (O) supply and overexpression of glutathione (GSH) in the tumor. Herein, a biodegradable O-loaded CuTz-1@F127 (denoted as CuTz-1-O@F127) metal-organic framework (MOF) therapeutic platform is presented for enhanced PDT by simultaneously overcoming intracellular hypoxia and reducing GSH levels in the tumor. The Cu(I)-based MOF is capable of a Fenton-like reaction to generate OH and O in the presence of HO under NIR irradiation. Meanwhile, the CuTz-1-O@F127 nanoparticles (NPs) can release adsorbed O, which further alleviates intracellular hypoxia. In addition, the Cu in CuTz-1@F127 can react with intracellular GSH to reduce the excess GSH. In this way, the efficiency of PDT is greatly enhanced. After tail intravenous injection, the NPs show high antitumor efficacy through a synergistic effect under 808 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, the NPs are biodegradable. In vivo biodistribution and excretion experiments demonstrate that a total of nearly 90% of the NPs can be excreted via feces and urine within 30 d, which indicates significant prospects in the clinical treatment of cancers.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the unique rare-earth lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals (UCNs), which can convert tissue-penetrable near-infrared (NIR) photonic irradiation into ultraviolet, visible, and NIR emissions, have a significant potential in bioimaging, diagnosis, and therapy, as well as in photovoltaic systems and optical data storage. Despite the promising achievements made in the past decade, critical challenges associated with low upconversion efficiencies and the overheating effect induced by NIR laser-irradiation still remain in the biomedical fields. In high demand are more well-defined material design and unique structural modifications that are capable of solving these technical concerns and promoting such promising NIR light-mediated upconversion nanocrystals for their further application in the medical sciences. Recent advances in upconversion nanomaterials have witnessed a tremendous development towards enhancing their photon conversion efficiency, which provides great opportunities in expanding the potential of the UCNs in bioimaging diagnosis and anticancer therapy. Hence, this review is mainly focused on summarizing the fundamental principles and strategies that improve upconversion luminescence and the approaches to reduce the local thermal effect on the basis of a rational design of UCNs. In addition, the future perspectives in the development of UCNs for biomedical applications are also proposed.",

Upon incorporating two specific radicals-sensitive NIR cyanine fluorophores onto UCNs surface, such nanoprobes can orthogonally respond to disparate oxidative and nitrosative stimulation, and generate spectrally opposite optoacoustic signal variations, which thus achieves compelling superiorities for reversed ratiometric tracking of multiple radicals under dual independent wavelength channels, and significantly, for precise validating\u00a0of their complex dynamics and correlations with redox-mediated pathophysiological procession in vivo.",

Currently, metal complex-based drugs are being successfully used in clinical applications owing to diverse properties such as multiple redox states, photo-induced ligand exchange, and preferential ligand and coordination numbers, which facilitate drug design and development. However, drawbacks such as toxicity, lack of specificity, and severe side effects have hampered their therapeutic outcome. Therefore, innovative strategies for improving the specificity and pharmacokinetics of conventional metal complex-based therapeutic agents are required. Recently, nanotechnology, which provides a unique toolbox for developing effective and safer medicine, has attracted considerable attention, mainly because of their ability to reduce side effects and enhance drug loading efficiency and pharmacokinetics. Considering the promising chemical and physical properties of diverse nanostructures, nanoformulation of metal complexes can be used to effectively address the problems associated with current metallodrug complexes, especially those based on stimuli-responsive therapeutic strategies, with excellent spatial, temporal, and dosage control. In this review, we have mainly focused on the specificity and environment-responsiveness of metallodrug nanoformulations as therapeutics, and summarized the recent strategies being used for developing metal complex-functionalized intelligent nanoplatforms, which respond to various types of stimuli, including endogenous signals (pH, redox conditions, and enzyme activities) or external triggers (light irradiation and magnetic field manipulations). In addition, we have also discussed the potential challenges associated with use of metallodrugs and their nanoformulations as effective precision therapy with improved specificity and minimal side effects.",

        "abstract": "The design and synthesis of porous heterometallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high thermal and chemical stability is a challenging task at present. In this work, by the heterometallic cooperative crystallization (HCC) approach, an original heterometallic MOF based on a tetra-carboxylic ligand has been solvothermally synthesized [In6O3Tb3O(CBDA)3]\u00b718DMF\u00b73H2O (In/Tb-CBDA) [CBDA = 5,5'-(carbonylbis(azanediyl))-diisophthalic acid, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide]. The framework of In/Tb-CBDA is cooperatively assembled from the rarely reported tetra-nuclear In4O2(COO)4 and tri-nuclear Tb3O(COO)6 clusters, and an organic ligand. Topological analysis indicates that In/Tb-CBDA exhibits a new (4,4,6)-connected topology with the Schl\u00e4fli symbol (4\u00b763\u00b782)6(43\u00b769\u00b783)2(62\u00b784)3. Noteworthy, forming multi-nuclear metal clusters prompts the framework to maintain high stability under the conditions of heating to 150 \u00b0C, exposure to air, and soaking in acidic and basic aqueous solutions for 12 h. After desolvation, In/Tb-CBDA shows permanent porosity proved by N2 adsorption isotherms. In addition, theoretical ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) calculation indicates that In/Tb-CBDA displayed high selective adsorption of CO2/CH4, C2H6/CH4 and C3H8/CH4 at room temperature. This work shows a striking example of a porous heterometallic MOF material with high thermal and chemical stability, which exhibits high-efficiency selective gas adsorption behaviour.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A water soluble 8-aminoquinoline based fluorescent Zn 2+  chemosensor (AQZ-2COOH) containing two carboxylic groups has been synthesized. The designed two carboxyl groups not only greatly improved the water solubility of this chemosensor but also increased its affinity for Zn 2+ . It has been proved that AQZ-2COOH, a pentadentate N, O-chelating ligand was able to coordinate with Zn 2+  through three nitrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, resulting in the formation of a stable Zn 2+  complex, and the binding constant between AQZ-2COOH and Zn 2+  was determined to be 3.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 9 \u202fM \u22121 . Furthermore, AQZ-2COOH shows 39-fold fluorescence enhancement upon binding of Zn 2+  in aqueous solution. However, this remarkable emission enhancement did not occur when other metal ions were present. Further study revealed that AQZ-2COOH had low biotoxicity, and live cell imaging showed that AQZ-2COOH can be efficiently phagocytized by HeLa cells, a visible green fluorescence from the intracellular area was observed after incubation with AQZ-2COOH and Zn 2+  for 3\u202fh, suggesting that AQZ-2COOH can be a promising candidate for detection of mobile Zn 2+  in biological systems.",

The prepared SiO 2  Au Ta 2 O 5  composite plasmonic photocatalyst was nitrided in ammonia flow at an appropriate temperature to obtain SiO 2  Au Ta 3 N 5  composite plasmonic photocatalyst. Benefitting from Au nanoparticlesu0027 surface plasmon resonance effect, the obtained SiO 2  Au Ta 2 O 5  composite plasmonic photocatalyst presents a novel photochemical activity of H 2  production from H 2 O with visible light response, and the prepared SiO 2  Au Ta 3 N 5  composite plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits a higher photochemical activity of H 2  production from H 2 O with visible light response than that of blank Ta 3 N 5  nanocrystalline. Furthermore, the excellent morphologies of SiO 2  Au Ta 2 O 5  and SiO 2  Au Ta 3 N 5  composites, e.g., sandwiched core-shell structure, monodisperse, and spherical, drastically improve their dispersion in solution, light harvesting, charge separation and transportation, which might do some contributions to improve their photocatalytic activities accordingly.

The forming mechanism of the regular octahedral crystals and self-assembled microspheres have been explored by SEM and HRTEM. The Mn 4+  doping concentration and reaction time were optimized for improving its optical properties. The emission intensity of K 2 LiGaF 6 :Mn 4+  can still keep 87% when it worked at 150\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating its excellent thermal stability. Moreover, the as-prepared K 2 LiGaF 6 :Mn 4+  have better photoluminescence intensity and thermal stability than the previously reported K 2 LiAlF 6 :Mn 4+ , which should be attributed the optimization of morphology and structure. Especially, the slight shift of peak position of K 2 LiGaF 6 :Mn 4+  than K 2 LiAlF 6 :Mn 4+  was also analyzed in detail. Finally, the as-prepared K 2 LiGaF 6 :Mn 4+  phosphor was packaged on WLED through combining the YAG:Ce phosphor. Excellent warm white light with the CCT\u00a0=\u00a04296\u00a0K,  R  a \u00a0=\u00a091, and luminous efficiency\u00a0=\u00a0137.56 lm\u00b7W \u22121  was obtained, making it becoming the promising red phosphor candidates for white light-emitting diodes.",

X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence spectrophotometer were utilized to characterize the prepared phosphors. XRD reveals that the samples begin to crystallize at 900\u202f\u00b0C and the pure SrGdAlO 4  can be obtained at 1000\u202f\u00b0C. FE-SEM images indicate that the SrGdAlO 4 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+ \u202f=\u202fTb 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) samples consist of fine and spherical grains with size around 100\u2013200\u202fnm in diameter. Under the excitation of the near ultraviolet light, the prepared SrGdAlO 4 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+ \u202f=\u202fEu 3+  and/or Tb 3+ ) phosphors show both the characteristic red emission of Eu 3+  ( 5 D J \u2192 7 F J\u2032  J, J\u2032\u202f=\u202f0, 1, 2, 3 transitions) and characteristic green emission of Tb 3+  ( 5 D 4 \u2192 7 F 6,5,4,3  transitions). There exists energy transfers from Gd 3+  to Tb 3+ , and Tb 3+  to Eu 3+  ions in SrGdAlO 4 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+ \u202f=\u202fEu 3+  and/or Tb 3+ ) phosphors. The luminescence color of SrGdAlO 4 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+ \u202f=\u202fEu 3+  and/or Tb 3+ ) phosphors can be tuned from blue to blue-green, green, white, orange, etc. by varying the doping species, concentration, and relative ration of the codoping Eu 3+ /Tb 3+  ions in SrGdAlO 4  host lattice to some extent. A single-phase white-light-emission has been realized in Tb 3+ /Eu 3+  codoped SrGdAlO 4  nanocrystalline phosphors. The obtained SrGdAlO 4 :Eu 3+ , SrGdAlO 4 :Tb 3+ , and SrGdAlO 4 :Eu 3+ ,Tb 3+  nanocrystalline phosphors have potential application in the areas of UV white-light-emitting diodes and other optoelectronics lighting and display devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Here, we demonstrate a new recreating blue-purple luminescence of La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9  and host sensitized luminescence in La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+  = Dy 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) nanocrystalline phosphors with multi-color luminescence evolution in response to UV light excitation. A series of La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9  and La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+  = Dy 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) nanocrystalline phosphors were synthesized via a citrate sol-gel method. X-ray diffractometer, FE-SEM, HRTEM, diffuse reflection spectra, photoluminescence spectra, and fluorescent decay lifetimes were utilized to characterize the prepared phosphors. The XRD results reveal that the prepared La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9  and La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+  = Dy 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) nanocrystalline phosphors present a single-phased trigonal crystal structure. FE-SEM and HRTEM images indicate that the prepared La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  phosphors consist of fine and spherical grains in size of around 35\u201360\u202fnm in diameter. Under the excitation of ultraviolet light, the La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9  presents a characteristic broad band emission of MoO 4  group from 300 to 550\u202fnm peaking at 399\u202fnm, and the La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+  = Dy 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) phosphors show the characteristic emissions of Dy 3+  ( 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2  and  4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2  transitions) and Eu 3+  ( 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F J  transitions,  J  = 1, 2, 3, and 4), respectively. There exists an energy transfer from La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9  host lattice to Dy 3+  and Eu 3+  ions in La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+  = Dy 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) phosphor. The luminescence color of La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Ln 3+  (Ln 3+  = Dy 3+  and/or Eu 3+ ) can be tuned from blue-white, white to orange-red by adjusting the doping concentration and the relative ratio of Dy 3+  to Eu 3+  in La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9  host lattice. A single-phase white-light-luminescence with high color purity has been realized in La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Dy 3+ ,Eu 3+  phosphor. The obtained La 2 Zr 3 (MoO 4 ) 9 :Dy 3+ ,Eu 3+  phosphor has potential application in area of UV-pumped white light-emitting devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Novel single-phased white-emitting Ca 3 Y(GaO) 3 (BO 3 ) 4 :Ce 3+ ,Tb 3+ ,Sm 3+  phosphors with high-efficiency, were successfully synthesized via traditional high temperature solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction, luminescence spectroscopy, fluorescence decay time and fluorescent thermal stability tests have been used to characterize the as-prepared samples. The energy transfer among of Ce 3+ , Tb 3+  and Sm 3+  ions in Ca 3 Y(GaO) 3 (BO 3 ) 4  host have been studied in detail. The mechanisms of Ce 3+  \u2192 Tb 3+  and Ce 3+  \u2192 Sm 3+  energy transfer were demonstrated to be dipole-dipole interactions. The emission color of the obtained phosphors can be easily tuned by controlling the doping concentration ratios of Ce 3+ /Tb 3+ /Sm 3+ . Particularly, under the excitation at 340\u202fnm, Ca 3 Y(GaO) 3 (BO 3 ) 4 :0.01Ce 3+ ,0.15Tb 3+ ,0.01Sm 3+  phosphor showed bright a white light with CIE coordinates of (0.2892, 0.2943) and internal quantum efficiency as high as 49.5%. By integrating this single-composition white-emitting Ca 3 Y(GaO) 3 (BO 3 ) 4 :0.01Ce 3+ ,0.15Tb 3+ ,0.01Sm 3+  phosphor with a 365\u202fnm near-ultraviolet (NUV) light emitting diode (LED) chip, we successfully fabricated a prototype white LED (WLED) device, which exhibited high-brightness nearly ideal white light with CIE coordinates of (0.310, 0.330), color rendering index of 72.7 and a correlated color temperature of 6624\u202fK. These results demonstrate that the proposed single-composition white-emitting Ca 3 Y(GaO) 3 (BO 3 ) 4 :Ce 3+ ,Tb 3+ ,Sm 3+  phosphors can serve as promising phosphors for the application of NUV-excited WLEDs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   By designing diverse composition substitutions in phosphor materials to construct solid solution phase transformation are effective strategies to adjust the luminescence properties of phosphor materials. In this study, the Ce 3+ -doped Y 4 Si 2 O 7 N 2  is selected as template material to design a series of composition substitutions including [Y 3+ -Lu 3+ ] cation substitution, and [SiN + -AlO + ] cation-anion cosubstitution, [B 3+ /P 5+ -Si 4+ ] substitutions for tuning photoluminescence property and thermal stability of the as-prepared solid solution phosphors. According to XRD and Rietveld refinement results, the Ln 4 Si 2- x  Al  x  O 7+ x  N 2- x  :Ce 3+  (Ln\u202f=\u202fY, Lu) could form perfect solid solution phases at 0\u202f\u2264\u202f x \u202f\u2264\u202f1 in terms of the same monoclinic structure of Ln 4 Si 2 O 7 N 2 -Ln 4 Al 2 O 9  with space group  P 21/a (14). While B- and P-doping only remain the solid solution phase at a low substitution ratio. Continuous spectral blue shift in the blue-green region and improved thermal stability are observed in Ln 4 Si 2- x  Al  x  O 7+ x  N 2- x  :Ce 3+  (Ln\u202f=\u202fY, Lu) and B/P-doped Y 4 Si 2 O 7 N 2 :Ce 3+  systems, which are possibly attributed to the enlarged crystal lattice environment around Ce 3+  ions with the [SiN-MO] (M\u202f=\u202fB, Al, O) cosubstitutions. In addition, the red-shift emission of Y 4 Si 2 O 7 N 2 :Ce 3+  with the increase of Ce 3+  concentrations are also discussed. In summary, this study systematically discussed the effect of the diverse composition substitutions on the luminescence properties, which could serve as a guide in developing novel oxonitridosilicate luminescent materials with controllable optical properties.",

Although the development and application of them involves some inevitable barriers, such as chronic toxicities, long-term stability, understanding of the biological fate and physiochemical properties, biodistribution, effect in the biological environment, circulation properties and targeting efficacy in vivo. The construction of stimuli responsive drug carriers using biologically safe materials, followed by hydrophilic modification, bioconjugation, targeting functionalization, and detailed safety analysis in small/large animal models may be the best way to overcome these barriers. Huge progress has been made in stimuli responsive drug delivery systems based on polymer and mesoporous silica materials, mainly including pH-, thermo-, light-, enzyme-, redox-, magnetic field- and ultrasound-responsive drug delivery systems, all of which are highlighted in this review.",

        "abstract": "Nanocyrstalline Tb3+ -doped LaGaO3 phosphors were prepared through a Pechini-type sol-gel process. X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence spectra, and lifetimes were utilized to characterize the synthesized phosphors. XRD results reveal that the sample begins to crystallize at 900\u00b0C and pure LaGaO3 phase can be obtained at 1000\u00b0C. FESEM images indicate that the Tb3+ -doped LaGaO3 phosphors are composed of aggregated spherical particles with sizes ranging from 40 to 80 nm. Under the excitation of ultraviolet light and low-voltage electron beams (0.5-3 kV), the Tb3+ -doped LaGaO3 phosphors show the characteristic emissions from the LaGaO3 host lattice and the Tb3+ (D 3,4 5 - F 6,5,4,3 7 transitions). The emission colors of Tb3+ -doped LaGaO3 phosphors can be tuned from blue to green by changing the excitation wavelength of ultraviolet light and the doping concentration of Tb3+ to some extent. Relevant luminescence mechanisms are discussed. \u00a9 2007 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "There are growing interests on phosphor thin films owing to their potential application in high-resolution devices such as cathode ray tubes and flat panel display devices. The solution-based sol-gel method is one of the most important techniques for the synthesis of vari-ous functional coating films. Compounds with the apatite structure are very suitable host lattices for various luminescent ions. Ca2RE8(SiO4)6O2 ( RE=Y, Gd, La ) is a kind of ternary rare-earth-metal silicate with oxyapatite structure, which has been used as host mate-rial for the luminescence of various rare earth and mercury-like ions. In this article, Ca2Gd8(SiO4)6O2:Dy3+ phosphor films were dip-coated on quartz glass substrates through the sol-gel process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as well as lifetimes were used to characterize the resulting films. AFM study revealed that the phosphor films consisted of homoge-neous particles. The Dy3+ showed its characteristic emission in crystalline phosphor films, i.e., 4F9/2\u20136H15/2 and 4F9/2\u20136H13/2.",

        "abstract": "Hollow Gd2O3:Ln (Ln = Eu3+, Sm 3+) microspheres were successfully fabricated by using carbon spheres as a template and urea as a precipitating agent, which involved the deposition of an inorganic coating on the surface of carbon spheres and subsequent calcination in the air. Various approaches including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the samples. The results indicate that the as-prepared products can be indexed to pure cubic Gd2O3 phase. The samples are composed of uniform hollow Gd2O3:Ln spheres with a mean particle size of about 300 nm. The possible mechanism of evolution from glucose to carbon microspheres and the chemical reaction of each step to form the final hollow spheres are proposed. In particular, the urea-assisted precipitation process was carried out in aqueous solution without any organic solvent, and the hollow spheres formation process was achieved by simple calcination without using any etching agents. The hollow Gd2O 3:Ln phosphors exhibit light emission under ultraviolet excitation, which may find promising applications in the fields of field emission displays (FED) and MRI contrast agents. \u00a9 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "In terms of the extremely small size and large specific surface area, nanomaterials often exhibit unusual physical and chemical properties, which have recently attracted considerable attention in bionanotechnology and nanomedicine. Currently, the extensive usage of nanotechnology in medicine holds great potential for precise diagnosis and effective therapeutics of various human diseases in clinical practice. However, a detailed understanding regarding how nanomedicine interacts with the intricate environment in complex living systems remains a pressing and challenging goal. Inspired by the diversified membrane structures and functions of natural prototypes, research activities on biomimetic and bioinspired membranes, especially for those cloaking nanosized platforms, have increased exponentially. By taking advantage of the flexible synthesis and multiple functionality of nanomaterials, a variety of unique nanostructures including inorganic nanocrystals and organic polymers have been widely devised to substantially integrate with intrinsic biomoieties such as lipids, glycans, and even cell and bacteria membrane components, which endow these abiotic nanomaterials with specific biological functionalities for the purpose of detailed investigation of the complicated interactions and activities of nanomedicine in living bodies, including their immune response activation, phagocytosis escape, and subsequent clearance from vascular system. In this review, we summarize the strategies established recently for the development of biomimetic membrane-cloaked nanoplatforms derived from inherent host cells (e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and exosomes) and invasive pathogens (e.g., bacteria and viruses), mainly attributed to their versatile membrane properties in biological fluids. Meanwhile, the promising biomedical applications based on nanoplatforms inspired by diverse moieties, such as selective drug delivery in targeted sites and effective vaccine development for disease prevention, have also been outlined. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospects of the biomimetic membrane-cloaked nanoplatforms are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), especially based on lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals (UCNs), have been extensively investigated as a promising strategy for effective cellular ablation owing to their unique optical properties to convert NIR light excitation into multiple short-wavelength emissions. Despite the deep tissue penetration of NIR light in living systems, the therapeutic efficiency is greatly restricted by insufficient oxygen supply in hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the coexistent tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play critical roles in tumor recurrence during the post-PDT period. Herein, we developed a unique photosensitizer-loaded UCNs nanoconjugate (PUN) by integrating manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets and hyaluronic acid (HA) biopolymer to improve NIR light-mediated PDT efficacy through attenuating hypoxia status and synergistically reprogramming TAMs populations. After the reaction with overproduced H2O2 in acidic tumor microenvironment, the MnO2 nanosheets were degraded for the production of massive oxygen to greatly enhance the oxygen-dependent PDT efficiency upon 808 nm NIR light irradiation. More importantly, the bioinspired polymer HA could effectively reprogram the polarization of pro-tumor M2-type TAMs to anti-tumor M1-type macrophages to prevent tumor relapse after PDT treatment. Such promising results provided the great opportunities to achieve enhanced cellular ablation upon NIR light-mediated PDT treatment by attenuating hypoxic tumor microenvironment, and thus facilitated the rational design of new generations of nanoplatforms toward immunotherapy to inhibit tumor recurrence during post-PDT period.",

        "abstract": "Near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) especially based on lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals (UCNs), have been extensively investigated as a promising strategy for effective cellular ablation owing to their unique optical properties to convert NIR light excitation into multiple short-wavelength emissions. Despite the deep tissue penetration of NIR light in living systems, the therapeutic efficiency is greatly restricted by insufficient oxygen supply in hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the coexistent tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play critical roles in tumor recurrence during post-PDT period. Herein, we developed a unique photosensitizer-loaded UCNs nanoconjugate (PUN) by integrating manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets and hyaluronic acid (HA) biopolymer to improve NIR light-mediated PDT efficacy through attenuating hypoxia status and synergistically reprogramming TAMs populations. After the reaction with over-produced H2O2 in acidic tumor microenvironment, the MnO2 nanosheets were degraded for the production of massive oxygen to greatly enhance the oxygen-dependent PDT efficiency upon 808 nm NIR light irradiation. More importantly, the bioinspired polymer HA could effectively reprogram the polarization of pro-tumor M2-type TAMs to anti-tumor M1-type macrophages to prevent tumor relapse after PDT treatment. Such promising results provided the great opportunities to achieve enhanced cellular ablation upon NIR light-mediated PDT treatment by attenuating hypoxic tumor microenvironment, and thus facilitated the rational design of new generations of nanoplatforms toward immunotherapy to inhibit tumor recurrence during post-PDT period.",

        "abstract": "In terms of the extremely small size and large specific surface area, nanomaterials often exhibit unusual physical and chemical properties, which have recently attracted considerable attention in bionanotechnology and nanomedicine. Currently, the extensive usage of nanotechnology in medicine holds the great potential for precise diagnosis and effective therapeutics of various human diseases in clinical practice in past decades. However, a detailed understanding regarding how nanomedicines interact with the intricate environment in complex living systems remains a pressing and challenging goal. Inspired by the diversified membrane structures and functions of natural prototypes, research activities on biomimetic and bioinspired membranes, especially for those cloaked with nano-sized platforms have increased exponentially. By taking advantages of the flexible synthesis and multiple functionality of nanomaterials, a variety of unique nanostructures including inorganic nanocrystals and organic polymers have been widely devised to substantially integrate with intrinsic bio-moieties such as lipids, glycans, even cell and bacteria membrane components, which endowed these abiotic nanomaterials with specific biological functionalities for the purpose of detailed investigation of their complicated interactions and activities in living bodies, including their immune response activation, phagocytosis escape, and subsequent clearance from vascular system. In this review, we summarized the strategies established recently for the development of biomimetic membrane-cloaked nanoplatforms derived from inherent host cells (e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and exosomes) and invasive pathogens (e.g., bacteria and viruses), mainly attributed to their versatile membranes properties in biological fluids. Meanwhile, the promising biomedical applications based on these diverse moieties-inspired nanoplatforms, such as selective drug delivery in targeted sites and effective vaccines development for diseases prevention etc, have also been outlined. Finally, the potential challenges and future prospectives of the biomimetic membrane-cloaked nanoplatforms were also discussed.",

Abstract Rare-earth ions (Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , Sm 3+ ) doped YVO 4 microspheres with uniform morphologies were successfully prepared via a simple hydrothermal route using N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as protective agent. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and the kinetic decays were employed to examine the resulting phase formation, particle morphology and luminescent properties. The XRD results reveal that all the doped samples are of high crystallization which are assigned to the pure tetragonal phase of YVO 4 . Additionally, the DMF/H 2 O volume ratio and the concentration of PVP both have obvious effects on the morphologies and sizes of the as-synthesized products. The sample prepared at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h with the DMF/H 2 O volume ratio of 3/1 and 0.4 g/L PVP concentration exhibits uniformly spherical shape with the diameter of 1\u20132 \u03bcm. Upon excitation by ultraviolet radiation or low-voltage electron beams excitation, the YVO 4 :Ln 3+ (Ln = Eu, Dy, and Sm) samples show strong light emissions with different colors from the doped Ln 3+ ions. These phosphors exhibit potential applications in the fields of fluorescent lamps and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Keywords Hydrothermal synthesis DMF PVP Luminescence YVO 4 1 Introduction As an important optical material, yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 ) has been widely used as an excellent polarizer [1,2] and laser host material [3,4] owing to its outstanding characteristics, such as good thermal, mechanical and optical properties. Moreover, rare-earth ions doped yttrium orthovanadate matrix has been employed to produce phosphors which can emit various colors because of the high luminescence quantum yields originating from the f\u2013f transitions [5] . Especially, Eu 3+ -doped YVO 4 powder, as a significant commercial red-emitting phosphor, has been extensively utilized in optical devices, such as color television, field emission displays (FEDs), cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and plasma display panels (PDPs) [6\u20138] . Besides europium ion, Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ ions have also been shown to be good activators [9,10] . In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the synthesis of inorganic phosphors with fine particle size, controlled morphologies and high luminescence efficiencies [11,12] . Many synthetic routes have been developed to prepare YVO 4 doped with rare-earth ions. For instance, high-temperature solid-state reaction is a conventional method, which is simple but has several disadvantages, such as high energy consumption and agglomeration of particles [13,14] . Compared with the conventional method, wet chemistry methods have been proved a more powerful technique for preparing single-phased and well-crystalline YVO 4 , such as sol\u2013gel process [8,15] , solution combustion synthesis [16] , co-precipitation reaction [17] , and low temperature hydrothermal methods [9,18,19] . Among all the methods for the synthesis of YVO 4 :Ln phosphors, hydrothermal method is one of the most important techniques, because it can synthesize particles with high-crystallinity, narrow size distribution and high purity at a mild reaction condition without milling or further calcination treatment [20] . In a hydrothermal process, chemical reactions are carried out in an autoclave in the presence of an aqueous solvent above room temperature and at elevated pressure. Furthermore, hydrothermal method can easily control the size and morphology of crystals through regulation of the starting materials quantum, reaction temperature and time. Wu et al. [21] reported the synthesis of well-defined YVO 4 microcrystal with clear facets in strongly acidic media and nanoflakes with dimensions of 5\u201350 nm in basic media. Wang et al. [22] prepared single phase of Eu 3+ -doped YVO 4 nanophosphors at different pH values (pH = 7\u201311) by a mild hydrothermal method. Wu et al. [23] synthesized YVO 4 nanorods/microtubes by a hydrothermal reaction of (NH 4 ) 0.5 V 2 O 5 nanowires templates with Y 3+ . This group has also synthesized rod-, olive-, and pineapple-shaped nanocrystals of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ using porous silicon substrates, V 2 O 5 nanowires, and CTAB additives [24] . Wang et al. [25] prepared nano- and micro-scaled Eu-doped yttrium orthovanadate powders via Na 2 EDTA-assisted morphology controllable hydrothermal method in a wide pH range. However, modern FEDs require the phosphors possess uniformly spherical morphology and suitable particle size range (1\u20133 \u03bcm), which can offer the possibility of brighter cathodoluminescent performance, high definition, and much improved screen packing due to their high packing density and reduction of light scattering [26\u201329] . Thus, developing a facile approach for the synthesis of YVO 4 :Ln 3+ microspheres with narrow size distribution should be highly potential. Herein, a simple and novel hydrothermal process was proposed for the synthesis of lanthanons doped YVO 4 particles with high-crystallinity and uniform morphology, in which N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) was firstly used as hydrothermal solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as protective agent. So far, there were only limited studies discussing the influences of hyrothermal parameters on the properties of rare earth doped crystalline YVO 4 phosphors, we altered the synthesis conditions including DMF/water volume ratio, PVP concentration, doped rare-earth ions and calcination temperature to modify the particle shape and luminescent properties. The obtained samples were well characterized by means of XRD, FESEM, TEM, optical spectra as well as the kinetic decay times. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Synthesis All the reagents including N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) (A. R., Beijing Beihua Chemical Co., Ltd.), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (A. R., Beijing Beihua Chemical Co., Ltd.), NH 4 VO 3 (A. R., Tianjin Damao Chemical Co., Ltd.), Y 2 O 3 , Eu 2 O 3 , Dy 2 O 3 , Sm 2 O 3 (99.99%, Science and Technology Parent Company of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry), HNO 3 (A. R., Beijing Beihua Chemical Co., Ltd.) were analytic grade and used without further purification. In a typical process, 0.117 g of NH 4 VO 3 was dissolved in 1 mL of HNO 3 . Then the H 2 O and DMF mixed solvent with a specific DMF/H 2 O volume ratio of 1, 2 or 3 were added. Different amounts of PVP (0.4 g, 0.8 g or 1.2 g) and 1 mL of 0.05 mol L \u22121 Eu(NO 3 ) 3 were added in the solution. The doping concentration of Eu 3+ was 5 mol% to Y 3+ in YVO 4 :Eu 3+ . After that, 0.107 g of Y 2 O 3 was dissolved in 3 mL of dilute HNO 3 with stirring and heated to drive off the superfluous HNO 3 until the Y(NO 3 ) 3 powders were obtained. Then the previous solution was added immediately with stirring. After stirred intensely for 30 min, the resulting solution was then transferred into a 50 mL sealed Teflon autoclave and heated at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled to the room temperature, the final products were separated by centrifugation, and washed several times with the ethanol and distilled water. Finally, the obtained samples were dried at 80 \u00b0C for 12 h. The annealing process was performed at 600, 700, 800, 900 \u00b0C in air for 3 h at a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C min \u22121 , respectively. The synthetic process described above has been used to prepare YVO 4 crystals doped with Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ , respectively. The doping concentration of Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ is 2 mol% that of Y 3+ in YVO 4 host, which has been optimized in our previous report [10] . 2.2 Characterization Powder X-ray (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku TR III diffractometer with Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15405 nm). The accelerating voltage and emission current are 40 kV and 200 mA. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images were inspected on a XL30 microscope (Philips) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS, JEOL JXA-840). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) were performed on a FEI Tecnai G 2 S-Twin transmission electron microscope with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. The PL excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The PL lifetimes of the samples were obtained from a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 Digital Oscilloscope (1 GHz) using a 250 nm laser (pulse width = 4 ns, gate = 50 ns) as the excitation source (Continuum Sunlite OPO). The powders of the samples used for lifetime measurement were held tightly and smoothly in a special groove for PL measurement. The cathodoluminescent (CL) measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (<10 \u22128 Torr), where the samples were excited by an electron beam at a voltage range of 1.5\u20133.5 kV with different filament currents, and the spectra were recorded on an F-4500 spectrophotometer. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase, structure and morphology The composition and phase of the products were first examined by XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized YVO 4 :Ln 3+ (Ln = Dy, Sm, and Eu) products and the standard data for tetragonal YVO 4 peak position (JCPDS No. 17-0341). It can be seen from Fig. 1 that all the samples exhibit the characteristic peaks of pure crystalline tetragonal YVO 4 with a space group of I 41 / amd , which are in good agreement with the values of the standard card (JCPDS No. 17-0341). The sharpening of the diffraction peaks indicates that the products are well-crystalline. No other phase related with doped components can be detected in the XRD patterns, suggesting that rare-earth ions have been homogenously incorporated into the host lattice. The calculated unit-cell parameters of the samples are summarized in Table 1 . As shown, the calculated cell parameters of a = b = 7.0924 \u00c5, c = 6.2978 \u00c5 for YVO 4 :Eu 3+ , a = b = 7.0828 \u00c5, c = 6.2925 \u00c5 for YVO 4 :Dy 3+ , and a = b = 7.0919 \u00c5, c = 6.2879 \u00c5 for YVO 4 :Sm 3+ are well consistent with the standard data of a = b = 7.1192 \u00c5, c = 6.2898 \u00c5 for pure tetragonal YVO 4 (JCPDS No. 17-0341). The morphology, size and microstructure details were investigated by SEM and TEM techniques. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ , YVO 4 :Dy 3+ , YVO 4 :Sm 3+ , TEM and HRTEM images of the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ , respectively. The SEM images ( Fig. 2 a and b) reveal that all the YVO 4 :Ln 3+ samples are composed of relatively uniform spherical particles with the particle diameter of 1\u20132 \u03bcm. The TEM image ( Fig. 2 c) of the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ sample clearly indicates well-dispersed and uniform spherical microspheres with narrow size distribution are obtained, which are much similar to the SEM images. Moreover, the lattice fringes in the HRTEM image ( Fig. 2 d) are apparent, suggesting the high-crystallinity of the sample. The lattice fringes of (200) planes with an interplanar distance of 0.35 nm are marked by the arrows. The calculated interplanar distance between the adjacent lattice fringes are in good agreement with the d 200 spacing of the standard value (0.352 nm) (JCPDS No. 17-0341), which further confirms that the high-crystallinity and single crystal feature of as-prepared sample. 3.2 Factors influencing the formation of the products and the formation process Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ samples prepared with different PVP concentrations. It can be seen that both the particle size and morphology change with the increase of the PVP concentrations. In the absence of PVP ( Fig. 3 a), the sample depicts a non-uniform size and inhomogeneous shape. For sample with the PVP concentration of 0.4 g/L ( Fig. 3 b), well-dispersed microspheres with the particle diameter of about 1\u20132 \u03bcm are observed. However, when the PVP concentration was increased to 0.8 g/L, some agglomerates appear, as shown in Fig. 3 c. And the agglomerates are more obvious when 1.2 g/L PVP was added ( Fig. 3 d). The results suggest that PVP concentration plays a critical role to the size and morphology of the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ particles and the sample prepared with the PVP concentration of 0.4 g/L has the optimum size and morphology. The SEM images of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ samples synthesized with different DMF/H 2 O volume ratios are exhibited in Fig. 4 . Clearly, there are some differences in the morphology and size of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ particles. As shown in Fig. 4 a, some block shaped particles can be obtained when pure water is used as the solvent, and no self-assembled microspheres can be found. For the sample synthesized with the DMF/H 2 O volume ratio of 1/1 ( Fig. 4 b), some spherical particles begin to appear, but they are irregular because a lot of small pieces can\u2019t be fully assemble. When the DMF/H 2 O volume ratio is increased to 3/1, regular microspheres with the particle diameter of 1\u20132 \u03bcm are obtained, as shown in Fig. 4 c. Whereas, there is an obvious agglomeration to form large particles when use pure DMF as solvent. On basis of above analysis, we can deduce that proper ratio of DMF in the mixed solvent is vital to the formation of final spherical YVO 4 :Eu 3+ product and the favorable volume ratio of DMF/H 2 O is 3/1. A possible self-assemble formation process of the spherical structure particles is presented in Scheme 1 . Typically, the amorphous YVO 4 nuclei are covered with PVP, which form the primary particles of precursor. Then the crystal nucleus began to grow on an isotropic growth through a random aggregation to form spherical aggregates. The spherical crystals become bigger and bigger with the continuous growth of precursor under the hydrothermal treatment. Finally, the microspherical particles formed after further growth and recrystallization. In this process, PVP act as an protective and capping agent to direct the structure and size of the final particles. The YVO 4 :Ln 3+ microspheress may probably be formed through a mechanism which is similar to that for the preparation of La(OH) 3 , CdSe, and Y 2 O 3 :Eu [30\u201332] . 3.3 Photoluminescence (PL) and kinetic properties The PL properties of the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ phosphors were characterized by the PL excitation and emission spectra, as shown in Fig. 5 a. The excitation spectrum ( Fig. 5 a, left) consists of a broad absorption band with a maximum at 278 nm, which can be assigned to the charge transfer from the oxygen ligands to the central vanadium atom inside the VO 4 3 - groups [33] . From the viewpoint of molecular orbital theory, it corresponds to transitions from the 1 A 2 ( 1 T 1 ) ground state to 1 A 1 ( 1 E) and 1 E ( 1 T 2 ) excited states of the VO 4 3 - ion [34] . The excitation lines of Eu 3+ ion can hardly be detected because the absorption intensity of the general f\u2013f transitions of the Eu 3+ ions in the longer wavelength region is very weak with respect to that of the VO 4 3 - groups, suggesting that the excitation of the Eu 3+ ions is mainly through the energy transfer from the VO 4 - groups to Eu 3+ ions [8,35] . Upon excitation into the vanadate group at 278 nm, the emission spectrum ( Fig. 5 a, right) exclusively contains the strong transition lines of 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 1 (593 nm), 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 (612 nm) and the very weak lines of 5 D 2 \u2192 7 F 0 (476 nm), 5 D 1 \u2192 7 F 1 (538 nm), 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 3 (649 nm), and 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 4 (698 nm). No emission from the VO 4 3 - groups are observed, indicating the efficient energy transfer from the VO 4 3 - group to Eu 3+ ions. The 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 emission of Eu 3+ ions belongs to hypersensitive transitions with \u0394 J = 2, which is strongly influenced by the outside surroundings. This emission transitions is dominant in the emission spectra when the Eu 3+ ion is located at a low-symmetry local site (without an inversion center). It is well known that YVO 4 possesses a tetragonal structure with a space group of I 1 / amd . The point symmetry of Y atom in YO 8 dodecahedra is D 2d , without an inversion center, while V atom is in the center of VO 4 tetrahedra ( T d ) [34] . When the Eu 3+ ions occupy the sites of Y 3+ ions in YVO 4 , the hypersensitive transition of Eu 3+ 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 domain the emission spectra. The PL spectra of YVO 4 :Dy 3+ and YVO 4 :Sm 3+ crystals are shown in Fig. 5 b and Fig. 5 c, respectively. As for YVO 4 :Dy 3+ , the excitation spectrum ( Fig. 5 b, left) consists of an intense band with a maximum at 280 nm assigned to VO 4 3 - absorption. Two characteristic peaks from 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 15/2 (484 nm, blue) and 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 (573 nm, yellow 1 For interpretation of color in Fig. 5, the reader is referred to the web version of this article. 1 ) are predominant bands in the emission spectrum of YVO 4 :Dy 3+ upon 280 nm excitation ( Fig. 5 b, right). The intensity of its yellow emission is stronger than that of the blue emission because the point symmetry of Dy 3+ ions is D 2d without an inverse center in the host of YVO 4 . Obviously, the strong emission of Dy 3+ is also due to an efficient energy transfer from the VO 4 3 - group to Dy 3+ in YVO 4 :Dy 3+ . Similarly, a strong band with a maximum at 307 nm associated with the absorption of the VO 4 3 - group has been detected in the excitation spectrum of YVO 4 :Sm 3+ ( Fig. 5 c, left). Excitation into the vanadate group at 307 nm yields the characteristic orange emission of Sm 3+ at 562 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 ), 602 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 7/2 ), and 645 nm ( 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 9/2 ), as shown in Fig. 5 c. No emission from the VO 4 3 - groups is observed, revealing that, similarly to the situations for Eu 3+ and Dy 3+ ions, an efficient energy transfer also occurs from VO 4 3 - to Sm 3+ . The 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 (602 nm) transition is the dominate emission peak for YVO 4 :Sm 3+ sample. Fig. 6 presents the corresponding CIE (Commission Intemationale de I\u2019Eclairage 1931 chromaticity) coordinates positions, which show the different emission colors for the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ , YVO 4 :Dy 3+ , and YVO 4 :Sm 3+ phosphors, respectively. The YVO 4 :Eu 3+ sample can emit bright red light and its chromaticity coordinates are x = 0.6074, and y = 0.3267 (point a in Fig. 6 ). The CIE coordinates for the emission spectrum of YVO 4 :Dy 3+ are determined as x = 0.3892, and y = 0.3859, located in the yellow region (point b in Fig. 6 ). The YVO 4 :Sm 3+ sample shows the luminescence color of orange, and the chromaticity coordinates are x = 0.5601, and y = 0.4144 (point c in Fig. 6 ). To study the decay behaviors of rare-earth ions in more details in the YVO 4 :Ln 3+ phosphors, the typical decay curves for the luminescence of Eu 3+ in YVO 4 :Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ in YVO 4 :Dy 3+ , and Sm 3+ in YVO 4 :Sm 3+ are measured, as shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that all the curves can be well-fitted into a double-exponential function as I = A 1 exp (\u2212 t / \u03c4 1 ) + A 2 exp (\u2212 t / \u03c4 2 ), in which \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 are the fast and slow components of the luminescence lifetimes, A 1 and A 2 are the fitting parameters, and the fitting results are shown in Fig. 7 . This indicates that the coordination environment of the rare-earth ions is homogeneous in YVO 4 . According to the formula \u03c4 = ( A 1 \u03c4 1 2 + A 2 \u03c4 2 2 ) /( A 1 \u03c4 1 + A 2 \u03c4 2 ) [9,34] , the average lifetime for 5 D 0 \u2192 7 F 2 (612 nm) of Eu 3+ , 4 F 9/2 \u2192 6 H 13/2 (573 nm) of Dy 3+ , and 4 G 5/2 \u2192 6 H 5/2 (602 nm) of Sm 3+ in the YVO 4 host lattices are determined to be 0.79, 0.19, and 0.52 ms, respectively. It is well accepted that the decay curve depends on the number of luminescent centers, defects, and impurities in host. Different sites in host lattices may generate several luminescent centers which lead to a multi-exponential behavior. In the YVO 4 :Ln 3+ crystals, Ln 3+ occupy the sites of the Y 3+ ions with the D 2d symmetry, indicating only one luminescent center exist. The multi-exponential behavior may be due to the adsorbed impurities which lead to the defects and the quenching centers. The double-exponential decay behavior of the activator is often observed when the excitation energy is transferred from the donor to acceptor. 3.4 Influence of annealing on the PL properties Influence of annealing temperatures on the PL emission intensities of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ sample is given in Fig. 8 . The spectrum is dominated by the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 emission of Eu 3+ at 612 nm. Obviously, the PL intensity of the as-prepared sample is much weaker than that of the samples after annealing. Additionally, it can also be seen that the PL intensities increase with the increase of annealing temperature. It is well known that the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 2 transition is highly sensitive to the structure change and environment effects. The better of the crystallization and the bigger of the particles exist, the less of the defects appear on the surface, which can increase the luminescent intensity. As a result, the phenomenon can be due to the enhanced crystallization of the YVO 4 :Eu 3+ with the increase of the annealing temperature, which results in the increase of the luminescent intensity. 3.5 Cathodoluminescence properties The cathodoluminescence (CL) properties of the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ crystals has also been investigated as a function of accelerating voltage and filament current, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10 , respectively. Fig. 9 exhibits the CL spectra of YVO 4 :Eu 3+ sample with an increase of the accelerating voltage from 1.5 kV to 3.5 kV when the filament current is fixed at 100 mA. It can be seen that the emission intensity increases with the increasing of the accelerating voltage. This is mainly because the electron energy increase and depth of the electrons penetrating into the phosphor\u2019s body also increase with the raise of the accelerating voltage, which induce more luminescence centers be excited. Similarly, the CL intensity increases with the filament current from 88 mA to 100 mA when the accelerating voltage is kept at 3.5 kV, as shown in Fig. 10 . The reason is also similar to the previous analysis. The electron penetration depth can be estimated by the empirical formula L [\u00c5] = 250( A / \u03c1 )( E / Z 1/2 ) n , in which n = 1.2/(1 \u2212 .29 log 10 Z ), A is the atomic weight, \u03c1 is the density, Z is the atomic number, and E is the accelerating voltage (kV) [36] . The increase of filament current can result in the larger electron beam current density. As a result, both the raise of the accelerating voltage and filament current can bring deeper penetration of electrons into the phosphor\u2019s body. Accordingly, the deeper the electron penetration depth, the more plasma will be produced, thus the more Eu 3+ ions can be excited, and the cathodoluminescence intensity also increases [15] . From the above results and analysis we can conclude that the as-prepared YVO 4 :Eu 3+ sample possess strong low-voltage cathodoluminescence intensity and excellent dispersing properties, which make them show potential applications in the field of emission display devices. 4 Conclusions In summary, rare-earth ion (Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ , and Sm 3+ ) doped YVO 4 microspheres have been successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process which use N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as protective agent. The characteristics of as-synthesized phosphors highly depended on the DMF/H 2 O volume ratio, concentration of PVP additive, and calcination temperature. The product obtained at the optimized conditions of 180 \u00b0C for 24 h with DMF/H 2 O volume ratio of 3/1 and 0.4 g/L PVP concentration exhibits well-defined spherical morphology with relatively narrow size distribution. The YVO 4 :Ln 3+ (Ln = Eu, Dy, and Sm) phosphors exhibit the characteristic emission lines of Eu 3+ , Dy 3+ and Sm 3+ , respectively. The decay curves of all the samples fit well into a double-exponential function. These phosphors demonstrate a potential application in the display fields based on their special size, morphology and luminescent properties.

        "abstract": "Herein, a novel red phosphor based on seven-coordinated Mn4+ ion-doped tridecafluorodizirconate, Na5Zr2F13 (NZF), has been synthesized by stirring a mixture of K2MnF6, NaF, and H2ZrF6 at room temperature. The crystal structure and morphology of the as-obtained phosphor NZF:Mn have been determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The composition and distribution of Mn4+ ions in NZF have been confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and element mapping via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The phosphor NZF:Mn exhibits a strong zero phonon line (ZPL) at 616 nm under excitation of blue light from a GaN light-emitting diode (LED) chip; this is attributed to the low symmetry of Mn4+ ions occupied in a seven-coordinated environment. The luminescence intensity of NZF:Mn has been optimized by controlling the synthesis procedure and synthetic parameters. The luminescence mechanism of the red phosphor NZF:Mn has been investigated according to the detailed experimental results. A warm white light has been produced by a WLED fabricated with the red phosphor NZF:Mn and the commercial yellow phosphor Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) on a GaN LED chip.",

In the present study, we report a facile strategy to synthesize a novel red phosphor LiSrGaF6:Mn4+ (LSGF:Mn) at room temperature, and we also discuss its formation mechanism. Mn4+ ions occupy Ga3+ sites located at the centers of distorted [GaF6]3- octahedrons and emit intense red luminescence when excited by UV or blue light. The effects of synthesis conditions such as the type of strontium salts, the concentrations of K2MnF6 and NH3\u00b7H2O, and the reaction temperature have been investigated. The luminescence intensity of the phosphor LSGF:Mn has been improved by optimizing the synthetic parameters. The as-prepared phosphor LSGF:Mn exhibits broad and intense absorption in the blue region and bright luminescence in the red region, which indicate that it is promising for applications in warm WLEDs.",

        "abstract": "Up to now, orchestrating the coexistence of Eu and Eu activators in a single host lattice has been an extremely difficult task, especially for the appearance of the characteristic emission of Eu and Eu in order to generate white light. Nevertheless, here we demonstrate a new Eu/Eu coactivated SrAlBO nanocrystalline phosphor with abundant and excellent multichannel luminescence properties. A series of Eu/Eu coactivated SrAlBO nanocrystalline phosphors were prepared through a Pechini-type sol-gel method followed by a reduction process. With excitation of UV/NUV light, the prepared SrAlBO:Eu,Eu phosphors show not only the characteristic f-f transitions of Eu ion (D \u2192 F, J, J' = 0-3), but also the 5d \u2192 4f transitions of Eu ion with comparable intensity from 400 to 700 nm in the whole visible spectral region. The luminescence color of the SrAlBO:Eu,Eu phosphor can be tuned from blue, blue-green, white, and orange to orange-red by changing the excitation wavelength, the overall doping concentration of europium ions (Eu, Eu), and the relative ratio of Eu to Eu ions to some extent. A single-phase white-light emission has been realized in SrAlBO:Eu,Eu phosphor. The obtained SrAlBO:Eu,Eu phosphor has potential application in the area of NUV white-light-emitting diodes.",

X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence spectra, as well as lifetimes were utilized to characterize the core-shell structured SiO2@Y3Al5O 12:Ce3+/Tb3+ phosphor particles. The obtained core-shell structured phosphors consist of well-dispersed submicron spherical particles with a narrow size distribution. The thickness of the Y 3Al5O12:Ce3+/Tb3+ shells on the SiO2 cores (average size about 500 nm, crystalline size about 30 nm) could be easily tailored by varying the number of deposition cycles (100 nm for four deposition cycles). Under the excitation of ultraviolet and low-voltage electron beams (1-3 kV), the core-shell SiO2@Y 3Al5O12:Ce3+/Tb3+ particles show strong yellow-green and green emission corresponding to the 5d-4f emission of Ce3+ and 5D4-7F J (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) emission of Tb3+, respectively.

NMOFs not only maintain the structural diversity and physicochemical properties of bulk MOFs, but also possess suitable dimensions, making them potential nanocarriers for imaging agents and drug molecules. In this work, highly monodispersed Fe-soc-MOF nanoparticles (about 100 nm) were fabricated through the liquid-solid-solution (LSS) method. Indocyanine green (ICG) was conjugated to the surface-modified Fe-soc-MOF to construct a multifunctional theranostic platform. The Fe-soc-MOF@PEG-NH2-ICG nanoparticles (FPINs) were tested for photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) both in vitro and in vivo. Due to their low toxicity, good biocompatibility and excellent photothermal/photodynamic effect, the as-synthesized FPINs could be used to inhibit and kill cancer cells efficiently under the 808 nm laser irradiation.",

Here, we constructed an intelligent, magnetic targeting and tumor microenvironment responsive nanocatalysts that can acquire oxidation therapy of cancer via specific reaction at tumor site. The magnetic nanoparticle core of iron carbide-glucose oxidase (Fe5C2-GOD) achieved by physical absorption has a high enzyme payload and the manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoshell as an intelligent \"gatekeeper\" shields GOD from premature leaking until reaching tumor tissue. Fe5C2-GOD@MnO2 nanocatalysts maintained inactive in normal cells upon systemic administration. On the contrary, after endocytosis by tumor cells, tumor acidic microenvironment induced decomposition of MnO2 nanoshell into Mn2+ and O2, meanwhile, released GOD. Mn2+ could serve as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for real-time monitoring treatment process. Then the generated O2 and released GOD in nanocatalysts could effectively exhaust glucose in tumor cells, simultaneously, generate plenty of H2O2 which may accelerate the subsequent Fenton reaction catalyzed by Fe5C2 magnetic core in mild acidic tumor microenvironment. Finally, we demonstrated the tumor site-specific production of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals for enhanced anticancer therapeutic efficacy but minimized systemic toxicity in mice.",

The design of quenching-shield layer can eliminate the back energy transfer from activator Tm3+ to sensitized Nd3+, thus significantly improving the UCL emission. The high surface area of mesoporous silica-coated UCNPs facilitates the stable and high loading amount of anatase TiO2. In vivo results indicate that 808 nm NIR light-mediated PDT using UCNPs@mSiO2@TiO2 as photosensitizers shows much higher antitumor efficacy than those with 980 nm and UV irradiations due to the higher...",

        "abstract": "ZnFeO, a semiconductor catalyst with high photocatalytic activity, is ultrasensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light and tumor HO for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thereby, ZnFeO can be used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) from direct electron transfer and the newly defined chemodynamic therapy (CDT) from the Fenton reaction. However, UV light has confined applicability because of its high phototoxicity, low penetration, and speedy attenuation in the biotissue. Herein, an upconversion-mediated nanoplatform with a mesoporous ZnFeO shell was developed for near-infrared (NIR) light enhanced CDT and PDT. The nanoplatform (denoted as Y-UCSZ) was comprised of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), silica shell, and mesoporous ZnFeO shell and was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. The UCNPs can efficiently transfer penetrable NIR photons to UV light, which can activate ZnFeO for producing singlet oxygen thus promoting the Fenton reaction for ROS generation. Besides, Y-UCSZ possesses enormous internal space, which is highly beneficial for housing DOX (doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent) to realize chemotherapy. Moreover, the  -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect from Fe and Gd ions in combination with the inherent upconversion luminescence (UCL) imaging and computed tomography (CT) from the UCNPs makes an all-in-one diagnosis and treatment system. Importantly,  and  assays authenticated excellent biocompatibility of the PEGylated Y-UCSZ (PEG/Y-UCSZ) and high anticancer effectiveness of the DOX loaded PEG/Y-UCSZ (PEG/Y-UCSZ&DOX), indicating its potential application in the cancer treatment field.",

        "abstract": "Desirable nanosystem that could not only deliver drugs safely and effectively into tumor sites, but also be expected to serve as photosensitizer to realize the photodynamic therapeutic function, would be of great significance in the synergistic cancer therapy. To perform this task, a multifunctional nanosystem has been developed for markedly enhanced cancer therapeutic efficacy by loading chemotherapy agent (doxorubicin hydrochloride, DOX) and photosensitive drug chlorin e6 (Ce6) into the channels of mesoporous zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) layer which coats on Nd3+-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). As a temperature sensitive phase change material (PCM), the loaded tetradecanol was served as switch for control release of DOX and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the condition of enhanced temperature triggered by the near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. The hyperthermia generated from the UCNPs cores exposed to NIR laser could raise the temperature of tumor location to 47.8 \u00b0C. The as-synthesized UCNPs@ZrO2-Ce6/DOX/PCM nanosystem demonstrates an excellent in vivo synergistic effect by administrating into U14 tumor-bearing mice via intravenous injection, under mild NIR laser irradiation (0.5 W cm\u22122, 5 min break after 5 min irradiation). In a word, our experimental results indicate that the finely designed UCNPs@ZrO2-Ce6/DOX/PCM may act as an ideal nanoplatform for multiple imaging guided tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "A proper photosensitizer and increased penetration depth are still two major challenges in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The conventional ultraviolet/visible irradiation light has low tissue penetration, which thus limits its clinical application. Herein, we for the first time designed a novel multifunctional composite by integrating NaGdF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd@Yb upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and black phosphorus sheets (BPS) for a single 808 nm laser light-mediated PDT. UCNPs, which served as the energy donor, were modified with poly(acrylic acid), and the BPS were stabilized by the PEG-NH2; then the two counterparts were integrated into the UCNPs\u2013BPS composite via electrostatic interaction. Under 808 nm near-infrared light irradiation, the composite exhibits excellent antitumor efficiency because of the large amount of reactive oxygen species generated compared with those under 650 and 980 nm irradiations with the same pump power, which has evidently been confirmed by in vitro and in vivo results.

However, the NIR-induced PDT is greatly restricted by overheating issues on normal bodies and low yields of reactive oxygen species (ROS, 1O2). Here, IR-808-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Nd,Yb) were combined with mesoporous silica, which has Ce6 (red-light-excited photosensitizer) and MC540 (green-light-excited photosensitizer) loaded inside through covalent bond and electrostatic interaction, respectively. When irradiated by tissue-penetrable 808 nm light, the IR-808 greatly absorb 808 nm photons and then emit a broadband peak which overlaps perfectly with the absorption of Nd3+ and Yb3+. Thereafter, the Nd3+/Yb3+ incorporated shell synergistically captures the emitted NIR photons to illuminate NaGdF4:Yb,Er zone and then radiate ultrabright green and red emissions. The visible emissions simultaneously activate the dual-photosensitizer to produce a large amount of ROS ...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lanthanide-doped nanoconstructs (LDNCs) have been widely studied in the biomedical field. Especially, LDNCs with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence show great promise in biological imaging. The fluorescence in the NIR window (700\u20131700\u202fnm) affords increased tissue penetration due to the reduced light absorption, photon scattering and autofluorescence. Actually, LDNCs with various lanthanide-dopings can emit ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS) and NIR photons through upconversion (UC) and downconversion (DC) processes. Moreover, there are review papers introducing different aspects of bioimaging based on LDNCs. Nevertheless, there has not been a review that systematically summarizes NIR fluorescent LDNCs. Herein, we summarize the recent progress made on NIR fluorescence imaging by highlighting the increasingly developing trend of NIR emitting LDNCs. The NIR emission mechanism of LDNCs activated by different lanthanide ions was discussed in detail, and their advantages as NIR fluorescent probes will be systematically introduced. From the aspect of realizing multimodal imaging, the advances made by combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and so on with NIR optical imaging were summarized. Finally, we discuss the superiority of NIR-II (1000\u20131700\u202fnm) emitting LDNCs when applied in biomedical imaging, with an emphasis on how to use them to realize imaging guided cancer therapy.",

Herein, a facile Mn-doping method was used to endow the upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with a biodegradable shell, simply by transforming mesoporous silica coated UCNPs (UCNPs@mSiO2) to Mn-doped upconversion nanocapsules (Mn-UCNCs). The yolk-structured Mn-UCNCs have huge internal space, which is greatly beneficial for DOX (a chemotherapeutic agent) storage. Furthermore, the Mn-doped nanoshell is responsive to mild reductive and acidic tumor condition, which enables the biodegradation of the silica shell in tumor sites and further accelerates the breakup of Si\u2013O\u2013Si bonds within the silica framework. This tumor-sensitive degradation of the shell not only facilitates DOX release in the tumor location but also allows faster nanoparticle diffusion and deeper tumor penetration, thus realizing efficient particle distribution and improved chemotherapy.

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a minimally invasive and high-efficiency anticancer approach, has received extensive research attention recently. Despite plenty of effort devoted to exploring various types of photodynamic agents with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance for PDT and many encouraging progresses achieved in the area, effective and safe photodynamic photosensitizers with good biodegradability and biocompatibility are still highly expected. In this work, a novel nanocomposite has been developed by assembly of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) and Au nanoparticles on black phosphorus sheets (BPs@Au@Fe3O4), which shows a broad light absorption band and a photodegradable character. In vitro and in vivo assay indicates that BPs@Au@Fe3O4 nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and exhibit excellent tumor inhibition efficacy owing to a synergistic photothermal and photodynamic therapy mediated by a low-power NIR laser. Importantly, BPs@Au@Fe3O4 can anticipatorily suppress tumor growth by visualized synergistic therapy with the help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This work presents the first combination application of the photodynamic and photothermal effect deriving from black phosphorus nanosheets and plasmonic photothermal effect from Au nanoparticles together with MRI from Fe3O4 NPs, which may open the new utilization of black phosphorus nanosheets in biomedicine, optoelectronic devices, and photocatalysis.",

Furthermore, the thermal effect can also stimulate the pH/temperature sensitive polymer in the cancer sites, thus realizing the targeted and controllable DOX release. The combined PDT, PTT and pH/temperature responsive chemo-therapy can markedly improve the therapeutic efficacy, which has been confirmed by both in intro and in vivo assays. Moreover, the doped rare earths endow the platform with dual-modal up-conversion luminescent (UCL) and computer tomography (CT) imaging properties, thus achieving the target of imaging-guided synergistic therapy under by a single NIR light.",

        "abstract": "Upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the Nd3+ doping derived down-conversion luminescence (DCL) in NIR region and thermal effect are extremely fascinating in bio-imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) fields. However, the concentration quenching induced opposite changing trend of the two properties makes it difficult to get desired DCL and thermal effect together in one single particle. In this study, we firstly designed a unique NaGdF4:0.3%Nd@NaGdF4@NaGdF4:10%Yb/1%Er@NaGdF4:10%Yb @NaNdF4:10%Yb multiple core-shell structure. Here the inert two layers (NaGdF4 and NaGdF4:10%Yb) can substantially eliminate the quenching effects, thus achieving markedly enhanced NIR-to-NIR DCL, NIR-to-Vis up-conversion luminescence (UCL), and thermal effect under a single 808 nm light excitation simultaneously. The UCL excites the attached photosensitive drug (Au25 nanoclusters) to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), while DCL with strong NIR emission serves as probe for sensitive deep-tissue imaging. The in vitro and in vivo experimental results demonstrate the excellent cancer inhibition efficacy of this platform due to a synergistic effect arising from the combined PTT and PDT. Furthermore, multimodal imaging including fluorescence imaging (FI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has been obtained, which is used to monitor the drug delivery process, internal structure of tumor and photo-therapeutic process, thus achieving the target of imaging-guided cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Developing nanotheranostics responsive to tumor microenvironments has attracted tremendous attention for on-demand cancer diagnosis and treatment. Herein, a facile Mn-doping strategy was adopted to transform mesoporous silica coated upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to yolk-like upconversion nanostructures which possess a tumor-responsive biodegradation nature. The huge internal space of the innovated nanocarriers is suitable for doxorubicin (DOX) storage, besides, the Mn-doped shell is sensitive to the intratumoral acidity and reducibility, which enables shell biodegradation and further accelerates the breakage of Si-O-Si bonds within the silica framework. This tumor-responsive shell degradation is beneficial for realizing tumor-specific DOX release. Subsequently, polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters that can enhance photothermal conversion in response to the tumor reducibility and acidity were modified on the surface of the silica shell, thereby achieving NIR-enhanced shell degradation and also preventing premature DOX leakage. The as-produced thermal effect of the POM couples with the chemotherapy effect of the released DOX to perform a synergetic chemo-photothermal therapy. Additionally, the shell degradation brings size shrinkage to the nanocarriers, allowing faster nanoparticle diffusion and deeper tumor penetration, which is significant for improving theranostic outcomes. Also, the drastic decline of the red/green (R/G) ratio caused by the DOX release can be used to monitor the DOX release content through a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method. The MRI effect caused by Mn release together with the MRI/CT/UCL imaging derived from Gd/Yb/Nd/Er co-doped UCNPs under 808 nm laser excitation endow the nanosystem with multiple imaging capability, thus realizing imaging-guided cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Exploring novel photosensitizer (PS) with good stability and high light converting efficiency and designing novel structure to integrate deep penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light excitable up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and PS into one system are highly fascinating in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) field. In this study, a novel core\u2013shell structured platform (UCNPs@g-C3N4\u2013PEG) with all-in-one \u201csmart\u201d functions for simultaneous photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy (PTT), and trimodal imaging properties has been rationally designed and fabricated. This system is composed of a core\u2013shell\u2013shell structured NaGdF4:Yb/Tm@NaGdF4:Yb@NaNdF4:Yb up-conversion luminescence (UCL) core and photoactive graphitic-phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) mesoporous shell closely coated on individual core. This designed structure allows large specific surface area, high loading amount, close proximity to the UCL core, and almost no leakage of g-C3N4 PS, thus ensuring sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) to damage tumor...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Synergistic treatment provides many advantages such as high efficiency and low risk of recurrence compared to single mode of therapy, while the current adoption of therapeutic agents have been greatly stifled by unresolved concerns including poor drug loading capacity and dissatisfactory therapeutic effect. Here we proposed and fabricated a multifunctional nanotheranostic agent, which consists of PEGylated and DOX-loaded bismuth tungstate nanosheets (abbreviated as Bi 2 WO 6 -DOX-PEG NSs). The Bi 2 WO 6  NSs not only possess excellent drug loading capacity (81.3\u202fwt%), but also can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high hyperthermia effect (36.5% heat transfer coefficient) when irradiated by high penetrated near-infrared (NIR) light with low power density (0.5\u202fW\u202fcm \u22122 ). The  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments show that the Bi 2 WO 6 -DOX-PEG NSs have negligible systemic toxicity, good photostability, and excellent computer tomography (CT) imaging effect. In vivo results also exhibit obviously higher tumor ablation performance of Bi 2 WO 6 -DOX-PEG than any single-modal therapy, which is derived from NIR laser triggered synergistic effect. As the first demonstration of Bi 2 WO 6  NSs as phototherapy agent, our finding may pave the way for the application of this kind of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials in biomedical field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a significant anticancer method by making full use of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells. However, high concentration of reductive glutathione (GSH) in tumor site is an enemy, which can decrease the PDT efficacy due to ROS consumption property of reductive GSH. To overcome the problem, here we design an innovative nanoplatform, which could integrate PDT, chemotherapy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one nanosystem. In this platform, MnO 2  nanosheets were employed as the carrier by conjugating photosensitizer (Au 25  nanoclusters) with platinum(IV) (Pt(IV)) prodrugs for synergistic PDT and chemotherapy. Interestingly, GSH can reduce MnO 2  nanosheets and Pt(IV) prodrugs simultaneously. Consequently, the concentration of intercellular GSH has been greatly decreased. More importantly, Mn 2+  reduced from MnO 2  nanosheets remarkably improves both  T  1 \u2013 and  T  2 \u2013weighted MRI owing to high level of GSH and H 2 O 2  in acidic tumor microenvironment, and Pt(II) reduced from Pt(IV) gives rise to high chemotoxicity to cancer cells. Combined with high PDT efficiency by consuming large amount of intercellular GSH, this nanoplatform has successfully achieved the MRI guided synergistic therapy, which is promising for potential clinic applications in cancer therapy.",

Here an 808 nm NIR light responsive dual-drug system was designed for cancer treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Mesoporous silica coated NaYF:Yb/Tm@NaGdF:Yb@NaNdF:Yb (UCNPs) with a core-shell structure (labeled as UCNPs@mSiO) was prepared and loaded with the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX). The surface of the composite was functionalized with \u03b2-cyclodextrin rings bridged by the light cleavable platinum(iv) pro-drug, thus blocking DOX inside the mesopores of silica. When excited by 808 nm NIR light, the emitted UV light from the UCNPs was used to activate the platinum(iv) pro-drug to gain higher toxicity platinum(ii) complexes and open the mesopores of silica (at the same time) to release DOX molecules. Both DOX and platinum(ii) complexes can kill cancer cells. This dual-drug delivery system may represent a new avenue for the application of UCNPs in photoactivated cancer therapy.",

To realize near-infrared (NIR) laser-induced multimodal imaging guided therapy, we constructed a multifunctional core\u2013shell structure (TiO2@Y2Ti2O7@YOF:Yb,Tm) by a facile coprecipitation route, followed by an annealing process. Under a single NIR laser irradiation, the highly cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for PDT can be generated due to the energy transfer from YOF:Yb,Tm to the Y2Ti2O7 photocatalyst which is responsive to blue emission (visible light), and the thermal effect can be simultaneously produced due to the nonradiative transition and the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs. The NIR light induced PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) can efficiently suppress tumor growth, which was evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo results.

        "abstract": "Optimal nano-sized drug carrier requires long blood circulation, selective extravasation, and efficient cell uptake. Here we develop a charge-convertible nanoplatform based on Pt(IV) prodrug loaded NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs), followed by coating a layer of PEG-PAH-DMMA polymer (UCNs-Pt(IV)@PEG-PAH-DMMA). The polymer endows the platform with high biocompatibility, initial nano-size for prolonged blood circulation and selective extravasation. Especially, the anionic polymer can response to the mild acidic stimulus (pH \u223c6.5) of tumor extracellular microenvironment and experience charge-shifting to a cationic polymer, resulting in electrostatic repulsion and releases of positive UCNs-Pt(IV). The positive UCNs-Pt(IV) nanoparticles have high affinity to negative cell membrane, leading to efficacious cell internalization. Simultaneously, the ultraviolet (UV) light emitted from UCNs upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, together with the reductive glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells efficiently activate the Pt(IV) prodrug to highly cytotoxic Pt(II), realizing NIR photon improved chemotherapy. The experimental results reveal the charge convertibility, low adverse effect and markedly enhanced tumor ablation efficacy upon NIR laser irradiation of this smart nanoplatform. Moreover, combining the inherent upconversion luminescence (UCL) and computed tomography (CT) imaging capabilities, an alliance of cancer diagnosis and therapy has been achieved.",

Here, a thermoresponsive nanoplatform was introduced by modifying carbon-coated iron carbide (Fe5C2) nanoparticles with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to achieve better water solubility and biocompatibility. Then a type of polymerization initiator (AIPH) was effectively loaded on the surface of Fe5C2\u2013BSA nanoparticles and sealed by a phase change material (PCM) for higher drug loading and controlled drug release stimulated by heat. Upon illumination by near-infrared light, the photothermal effect of Fe5C2 nanoparticles melts the PCM, triggering the release of encapsulated AIPH to produce free radicals, which effectively kill the hypoxia cancer cells. Additionally, the special magnetic performance enables targeted and tracked therapy under the driving of an external magnetic field.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and kinetic decay were used to characterize the sample. The results indicate that the nanocomposite with general 50 nm shell thickness and 270 nm core size shows typical ordered mesoporous characteristics (2.4 nm) and has spherical morphology with a smooth surface and narrow size distribution. Additionally, the obtained inorganic nanocomposite shows the characteristic emission of Eu3+ ( 5D0 \u2192 7F1-4) even after the loading of drug molecules. The biocompatibility test on L929 fibroblast cells using MTT assay reveals low cytotoxicity of the system. Most importantly, the nanocomposite can be used as an effective drug delivery carrier. A typical anticancer drug, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), was used for drug loading, and the DOX release, cytotoxicity, uptake behavior and therapeutic effects were examined. It was found that DOX is shuttled into the cell by the nanocomposite and released inside cells after endocytosis and that the DOX-loaded nanocomposite exhibited greater cytotoxicity than free DOX. These results indicate that core-shell structured Gd2O3:Eu 3+@nSiO2@mSiO2 nanocomposite has potential for drug loading and delivery into cancer cells to induce cell death. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were employed to characterize the samples. The results demonstrate that the samples can be well indexed to the pure cubic phase of Y 2O 3. The TEM and SEM images indicate that the shell of the uniform hollow spheres, whose diameter is about 2.1 \u03bcm, is composed of many uniform nanoparticles with diameters of around 20 nm. Upon ultraviolet (UV) and low-voltage electron beam excitation, the Y 2O 3:Ln 3+ (Ln 3+ = Eu 3+, Tb 3+) samples exhibit bright red (Eu 3+, 5D 0 \u2192 7F 2), and green (Tb 3+, 5D 4 \u2192 7F 5) luminescence. This material may find potential applications in light display systems, optoelectronic devices and drug delivery based on the uniform hollow structure, dimensions, and luminescence properties. Furthermore, this synthesis route may be of great significance in the preparation of other hollow spherical materials. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "\nIn this paper, M3(VO4)2:Eu3+(M\u00a0=\u00a0Ca, Sr, Ba) phosphors have been synthesized by high-temperature solid-state method. The phase composition and luminescence properties of the synthesized phosphors were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, respectively. The influences of fluxing agent and doped concentration of rare-earth ions on PL properties of the phosphor were investigated. The results indicated that the energy transfers between VO4 3\u2212 and Eu3+ in the host occurred mainly via a dipole\u2013dipole interaction mechanism. The increase in cation radius (from Ca2+ to Ba2+) in the host causes the emission peak originated from 5D0\u00a0\u2192\u00a07F2 transition of Eu3+ shifting from 615 to 621\u00a0nm, as well as decreasing the fluorescence lifetimes of Eu3+ from 0.77 to 0.19\u00a0ms and changing the CIE chromaticity coordinates from the orange-red region to the white region. Moreover, the emission colors of Ba3\u2212x (VO4)2:xEu3+ can be firstly adjusted from cyan region to white light region via controlling the concentration of Eu3+. Temperature-dependent luminescence spectra proved the good thermal stability of the as-prepared phosphor. This work shows the potential application of europium-doped samples in UV converted pc-WLEDs.",

In contrast, ultrasmall (sub-10 nm) nanoparticles have minimal safety risk because they can escape from macrophages, pass biological barriers, and be easily degraded or excreted from the body. In this review, we mainly introduce new progress in preparation strategies, imaging and drug delivery with regards to ultrasmall UCNPs, with an emphasis on rare earth fluorides, NaREF. Finally, we discuss the future outlook and challenges relating to ultrasmall UCNPs.",

Rare earth compounds B2. Phosphors 1 Introduction Garnets have attracted much attention due to their considerable hardness, high thermal conductivity and good chemical stability [1] . The best-known garnet is Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG), which is widely studied and used as host lattice for laser materials [2] . Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 , gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) is also a very important garnet for magneto-optic applications [3] . Up to now, several papers have been published on various lanthanide and transition metal ion-doped GGG compounds, which mainly focused on their lasing or upconversion properties [4\u201313] . So far the most frequently used synthesis methods for GGG single crystals and polycrystalline powders are the Czochralski technique [5,7,8,11\u201313] and solution combustion (propellant) process [4,9,10] . A simple and economical method for making high-quality GGG compounds is desirable. The solution-based sol\u2013gel method is one of the most important techniques for the synthesis of various functional materials, because it possesses a number of advantages over conventional formation techniques, such as homogeneous mixing of the precursors and low processing temperature [6,14] . In fact, some efforts have been made to prepare various kinds of phosphors via the sol\u2013gel method in the past decade [15\u201318] . But in a conventional sol\u2013gel process, the precursors used are metal alkoxides and/or organometallic compounds, which suffer from high cost, toxicity and inconvenience to control the experimental process. As an alternative approach, the Pechini-type sol\u2013gel process mainly employs inexpensive and nontoxic inorganic salts as precursors, citric acid as a chelate ligand and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a cross-linking agent [19] . To the best of our knowledge, so far no paper has been published on the preparation of rare earth-doped GGG compounds by the Pechini sol\u2013gel process. Therefore, in this paper, we report the growth of GGG:Ln ( Ln = Eu 3 + , Tb 3 + , Er 3 + ) nanocrystalline powder and thin film phosphors by the Pechini sol\u2013gel process, and investigate their photoluminescence (PL) properties in the visible and near infrared region (NIR) as well as their upconversion (anti-Stokes) luminescence properties. 2 Experimental section The thin film and powder samples with compositions of Gd 3(1\u2212 x ) Ln 3 x Ga 5 O 12 ( Ln = Eu 3 + , Tb 3 + , Er 3 + ; 0.01 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 0.12 ) were prepared by a Pechini sol\u2013gel process using Ga 2 O 3 (99.999%, analytical reagent, A. R.), Gd 2 O 3 (99.99%), Eu 2 O 3 (99.99%), Tb 4 O 7 (99.99%) and Er 2 O 3 (99.99%) as the starting materials [20\u201322] . Taking Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 as an representative example, 2.5 mmol Ga 2 O 3 , 1.365 mmol Gd 2 O 3 (99.99%), 0.135 mmol Eu 2 O 3 were weighed and dissolved in dilute HCl (A. R.) under vigorous stirring, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted between 2 and 3. Then 50 ml of water\u2013ethanol solution (the alcohol/water volume ratio is 7:1) containing citric acid (A. R.) as a chelating agent for the metal ions was added to the solution. The molar ratio of metal ions to citric acid was 1:2. Four grams of PEG (molecular weight=10 000, A. R., the PEG concentration is C PEG = 80 mg/ml) was added as a cross-linking agent. Highly transparent sols were obtained after stirring for a few hours. In order to obtain thin film samples, thoroughly cleaned silica glass substrates were dipped into the sols and withdrawn at a speed of 0.5 cm/s. The as-formed transparent films were dried at 120 \u00b0C immediately to drive off the remaining solvent, and then annealed to 500 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 60 \u00b0C/h and held there for 2 h. Finally, the preheated film samples were fired at a rate of 100 \u00b0C/h to high temperatures (600\u20131000 \u00b0C) and held at each temperature for 2 h in air. For those films containing Tb 3+ , the above annealing process was performed in a reducing atmosphere of 95% N 2 +5% H 2 (volume ratio). To obtain powder samples, the sols were concentrated in a 70 \u00b0C water bath to form dry gels, which were annealed using the same annealing procedures for the films as stated above. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of the samples was done on a Rigaku-Dmax 2500 diffractometer using Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15405 nm ) . Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were measured with Perkin-Elmer 580B infrared spectrophotometer with the KBr pellet technique. The morphology of the phosphors was measured on field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, XL30, Philips). An atomic force microscope (AFM) with QUSANT 250 was used to measure the thickness of the films. The excitation and emission spectra were obtained on an F-4500 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source. The NIR emission spectra were acquired using the 488 nm argon ion laser line (Spectra-Physics 170) as the excitation source and recorded with an InGaAs detecting device working in the range of 800\u20131700 nm. The upconversion emission spectra were obtained using 800 nm laser line from an OPO (optical parametric oscillator, Continuum Surelite, USA) and detected by R955 (HAMAMATSU) from 500 nm to 700 nm. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Formation process and morphology The XRD results revealed that both the thin film and powder samples of Gd 3(1\u2212 x ) Ln 3 x Ga 5 O 12 ( Ln = Eu 3 + , Tb 3 + , Er 3 + ; 0.01 \u2a7d x \u2a7d 0.12 ) began to crystallize at 700 \u00b0C and the crystallinity increased with increasing annealing temperature. Fig. 1 shows the representative XRD patterns of the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 compounds annealed at 800 \u00b0C (a, film; b, powder) and (c) JCPDS Card No. 13-0493 for Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 as a reference. The XRD pattern of Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 film [ Fig. 1(a) ] exhibits a strong broad peak at 2 \u03b8 \u224821.4\u00b0 (which is also present in the pure silica glass substrate) and is ascribed to silica glass substrate (JCPDS Card No. 29-0085) [20\u201322] . Since the film is very thin (a layer of the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 crystallites created by single dip has a thickness of about 200 nm, measured by AFM with QUSANT 250), the X-ray results of the film samples are influenced greatly by the silica glass substrate. However, the diffraction peaks at 2 \u03b8 \u224828.7\u00b0, 32.2\u00b0, 35.3\u00b0, 53.2\u00b0 and 55.4\u00b0 which are assigned to the (4 0 0), (4 2 0), (4 2 2), (6 4 0) and (6 4 2) reflections of cubic Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 ( Ia 3 d , JCPDS No. 13-0493) can still be seen in the film sample, as shown in Fig. 1(a) . All the diffraction peaks can be seen more obviously in the XRD pattern of the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 powder sample annealed at 800 \u00b0C [ Fig. 1(b) ], which are in complete agreement with those of the JCPDS Card No. 13-0493 for Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 [ Fig. 1(c) ]. In general, the nanocrystallite size can be estimated from the Scherrer equation, D = 0.941 \u03bb / \u03b2 cos \u03b8 , where D is the average grain size, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength (0.15405 nm), and \u03b8 and \u03b2 are the diffraction angle and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of an observed peak, respectively [23] . The strongest (4 2 0) peak at 2 \u03b8 = 32.2 \u00b0 was used to calculate the crystallite sizes of Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 powder and film samples annealed at 800 \u00b0C. The obtained crystallite size for the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 powders (62 nm) is much larger than that of the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 films (15 nm) at the same annealing temperature (800 \u00b0C). This may be caused by the slightly different crystallization behaviors between the film and powder samples. The grains in the powders can grow freely in three dimensions, while those in thin films mainly grow in two dimensions. This results in the average crystallite size in powders being larger than that in thin films [20,21] . The FT-IR spectra of the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 gel powders annealed from 150 to 900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 2 . For the samples dried at 150 \u00b0C, the FT-IR spectrum shows several intense broad absorption bands of \u2013OH group (3445 cm \u22121 ), \u2013CH 2 group (2987 cm \u22121 ), NO 3 \u2212 group (1739 cm \u22121 , 1627 cm \u22121 ), carbonate COO \u2212 group (1380 cm \u22121 ) as well as some weak absorption bands between 1200 and 500 cm \u22121 , all of which arise from the starting materials such as citric acid, PEG, Gd(NO 3 ) 3 , Eu(NO 3 ) 3 and Ga(NO 3 ) 3 etc., as observed previously [20,21] . The absorption intensity of these bands decreased with increasing sintering temperature due to the pyrolysis of the organic species. For the samples annealed at 500 \u00b0C, only a broad absorption band between 400 and 900 cm \u22121 , which belongs to the amorphous Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 , can be observed in the FT-IR spectrum. After further heat treatment to 700 \u00b0C, one strong broad absorption band located at 550\u2013650 cm \u22121 appeared in the spectrum, which belongs to the Ga\u2013O and/or Gd\u2013O stretching vibration mode for crystalline Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 phase [22,24,25] . This suggests that crystalline Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 has formed at this temperature (700 \u00b0C ). After further heat treatment from 700 to 900 \u00b0C, the absorption intensity of the Ga\u2013O and Gd\u2013O bonds turns stronger due to the improvement of the crystallinity with increasing annealing temperature. At 900 \u00b0C, there are also two weak and broad peaks at 3500 and 1650 cm \u22121 , which may be due to the absorbed H 2 O in the course of the measurement. The morphologies of the Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 powder and film samples were measured by FE-SEM, which are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) , respectively. According to Fig. 3(a) , we can see that the powder samples consist of aggregated particles with an average grain size of 100 nm. From Fig. 3(b) it can be seen that the film samples are uniform and crack-free, mainly consisting of closely packed uniform particles with an average grain size of 90 nm. Additionally, the surface is very smooth, and the particles in the film samples are more homogeneous than those in the powder samples. We also measured the thickness of the films by AFM with QUSANT 250, indicating that the layer of Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 crystallites created by a single dip has a thickness of about 200 nm. The average grain size observed from the FE-SEM micrographs is much larger than that estimated from the Scherrer equation. This indicates that the particles are not single crystals, but polycrystallites that contain several of the crystalline grains. 3.2 Luminescence properties Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 :Ln ( Ln = E u 3 + , T b 3 + ) films . Fig. 4 shows the (a) excitation and (b) emission spectra in the UV/vis spectral range of Gd 2.73 Eu 0.27 Ga 5 O 12 phosphor films annealed at 800 \u00b0C. The excitation spectrum was obtained by monitoring the emission of the Eu 3+ 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 transition at 591 nm. It can be seen clearly that the excitation spectrum mainly consists of a broad intense band with a maximum at 237 nm and a weak one with a maximum at 277 nm [ Fig. 4(a) ]. The former is attributed to the Eu 3+ \u2013O 2\u2212 charge transfer band (CTB) or the absorption of the GGG host lattice, while the latter is assigned to the 8 S\u2013 6 I transition for Gd 3+ [24] . The general f-f transition lines of Eu 3+ in the longer wavelength region have not been observed due to their relatively weak intensity compared with the strong broad band at 237 nm. Upon exciting into the intense broad band at 237 nm, we can observe the strong emissions corresponding to the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F J ( J = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) transitions of Eu 3+ . The emission spectrum of Eu 3+ is dominated by the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 transition at 591 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(b) . This indicates that the Eu 3+ ions are accommodated in a centrosymmetric site or a nearly centrosymmetric site [13,26] , which is in agreement with the crystal structure of Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 . According to Ref. [13] , there are three kinds of nonequivalent crystalline sites in GGG:Eu 3+ crystals, i.e. the dominant D 2 -site, the D 2h -site and the possible C 2v -site. In view of their close ionic radii [for coordination number of 8, r ( Eu 3 + ) = 0.107 nm , r ( Gd 3 + ) = 0.105 nm ] and valence state (+3) in Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 [27] , the Eu 3+ will predominantly enter into the dodecahedral Gd 3+ -sites and therefore possess D 2 symmetry (very close to D 2h with an inversion center) [4,28] . Thus, it can be understood that the 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 , magnetically allowed transition of Eu 3+ dominates the emission spectrum. Fig. 5 shows the (a) excitation and (b) emission spectra of Gd 2.85 Tb 0.15 Ga 5 O 12 phosphor films annealed at 800 \u00b0C. In the excitation spectra [ Fig. 5(a) ], the strong 4f 8 \u20134f 7 5d 1 transition band of Tb 3+ or the absorption band of the GGG host lattice at 237 nm as well as the 8 S\u2013 6 I transition line at 277 nm for Gd 3+ can be seen clearly. Upon excitation into the intense broad band at 237 nm, we can observe the characteristic strong emissions [ Fig. 5(b) ] corresponding to the 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F J ( J = 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) transitions of Tb 3+ . By varying the contents of the rare earth ions Ln ( Ln = Eu 3 + , Tb 3 + ) in Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 films, we determined the compositions with the highest PL emission intensity, as shown in Fig. 6 [(a), Eu 3+ ;(b), Tb 3+ ]. The PL emission intensity of Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ increases with increasing concentration ( x ), first reaching a maximum value at x = 0.09 , and 0.05 for Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ , respectively, and then decreasing with increasing concentration ( x ) due to the concentration quenching. Thus the optimum concentrations for Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ are determined to be 9 and 5 at%, respectively, of Gd 3+ in Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 films. Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 : Er 3 + powder . Since the luminescent intensities of the Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 : Er 3+ film samples are very weak, we investigated their optical properties in the powder form. The excitation spectrum ( \u03bb em = 555 nm ) of Gd 2.97 Er 0.03 Ga 5 O 12 powder [ Fig. 7(a) ] mainly consists of the f\u2013f transition lines of Er 3+ , and the emission spectrum ( \u03bb ex = 383 nm ) [ Fig. 7(b) ] contains exclusively the characteristic transition lines of Er 3+ , e.g. the transition lines at 524 nm ( 2 H 11/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 ) and 543, 555 nm ( 4 S 3/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 ). Excitation into the 4 F 7/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition of Er 3+ with a 488 nm laser, the NIR emission of Er 3+ can be observed in the Gd 2.97 Er 0.03 Ga 5 O 12 powder sample ( Fig. 8 ). The NIR emission spectra are composed of four groups of transition lines, i.e. the weak 4 S 3/2 \u2013 4 I 13/2 transition between 830 and 870 nm (I), the stronger 4 I 11/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition between 900 and 1075 nm (II), the weak 4 S 3/2 \u2013 4 I 11/2 transition between 1225 and 1275 nm (III), and the strongest 4 I 13/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition between 1400 and 1700 nm (IV). Fig. 9 shows the upconversion luminescence spectra of the Gd 2.97 Er 0.03 Ga 5 O 12 powder sample. Upon excitation into the 4 I 9/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition of Er 3+ with a 800 nm laser, green upconversion luminescence from the ( 2 H 11/2 , 4 S 3/2 )\u2013 4 I 15/2 transition and red from the 4 F 9/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition can be observed in the Gd 2.97 Er 0.03 Ga 5 O 12 phosphors [ Fig. 9] , as reported previously [4,5] . According to the previously published results, the upconversion luminescence of Er 3+ in the Gd 2.97 Er 0.03 Ga 5 O 12 phosphor occurs via two-photon process [4,5] . The excited state absorption (ESA) is the dominant mechanism for the upconversion luminescence of Er 3+ in the Gd 2.97 Er 0.03 Ga 5 O 12 phosphor, and the progress can be depicted as follows: one Er 3+ is excited from the ground state to the 4 I 9/2 level by absorbing one 800 nm laser photon, then decays nonradiatively to the 4 I 11/2 state; another 800 nm photon will excite the Er 3+ ion in the 4 I 11/2 level to the 4 F 3/2 state, then it returns to the 4 I 15/2 ground state and generates the red and green upconverted emissions. On the other hand, the Er 3+ ion in the 4 I 9/2 level can also decay nonradiatively to the 4 I 13/2 state; following absorption of a second 800 nm photon via an ESA process, it is excited to the 2 H 11/2 state; after undergoing a multi-phonon relaxation process, the upconverted emissions are observed from this and the lower emitting states. The process is clearly illustrated in Fig. 10 [4,5] . 4 Conclusions GGG:Ln ( Ln = Eu 3 + , Tb 3 + , Er 3 + ) powder and thin film phosphors were prepared by the Pechini sol\u2013gel process using inexpensive and nontoxic inorganic compounds as main precursors. The rare earth ions Eu 3+ , Tb 3+ and Er 3+ show their characteristic orange ( 5 D 0 \u2013 7 F 1 ), green ( 5 D 4 \u2013 7 F 5 ) and green ( 4 S 3/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 ) emissions in the crystalline GGG compounds, and the optimum concentrations for Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ were determined to be 9 and 5 at% of Gd 3+ in the GGG film samples, respectively. Green upconverted emission from the ( 2 H 11/2 , 4 S 3/2 )\u2013 4 I 15/2 transition and red from the 4 F 9/2 \u2013 4 I 15/2 transition were also observed in the GGG: Er 3+ (1%) powder sample. The excited state absorption (ESA) processes are the possible dominant mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, is a complex endocrinopathy. Because the cause of PCOS at the molecular level is largely unknown, there is no cure or specific treatment for PCOS. Here, we show that transplantation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) reversed anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries in a dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rat. BAT transplantation into a PCOS rat significantly stabilized menstrual irregularity and improved systemic insulin sensitivity up to a normal level, which was not shown in a sham-operated or muscle-transplanted PCOS rat. Moreover, BAT transplantation, not sham operation or muscle transplantation, surprisingly improved fertility in PCOS rats. Interestingly, BAT transplantation activated endogenous BAT and thereby increased the circulating level of adiponectin, which plays a prominent role in whole-body energy metabolism and ovarian physiology. Consistent with BAT transplantation, administration of adiponectin protein dramatically rescued DHEA-induced PCOS phenotypes. These results highlight that endogenous BAT activity is closely related to the development of PCOS phenotypes and that BAT activation might be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of PCOS.",

        "abstract": "Pigs lack functional uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) making them susceptible to cold. Nevertheless, several pig breeds are known to be cold resistant. The molecular mechanism(s) enabling such adaptation are currently unknown. Here, we show that this resistance is not dependent on shivering, but rather depends on UCP3 and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. In two cold-resistant breeds (Tibetan and Min), but not a cold-sensitive breed (Bama), WAT browning was induced after cold exposure. Beige adipocytes from Tibetan pigs exhibited greater oxidative capacity than those from Bama pigs. Notably, UCP3 expression was significantly increased only in cold-resistant breeds, and knockdown of UCP3 expression in Tibetan adipocytes phenocopied Bama adipocytes in culture. Moreover, the eight dominant pig breeds found across China can be classified into cold-sensitive and cold-resistant breeds based on the UCP3 cDNA sequence. This study indicates that UCP3 has contributed to the evolution of cold resistance in the pig and overturns the orthodoxy that UCP1 is the only thermogenic uncoupling protein.",

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy that is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary. However, there is a lack of effective treatment for PCOS at present because the pathologic cause of PCOS has not been elucidated. Although it has been known that brown adipose tissue transplantation ameliorates PCOS by activating endogenous BAT, BAT transplantation is not applicable in clinic. Therefore, BAT activation with natural compound could be an effective treatment strategy for PCOS patients. Here, we found that 3 weeks of rutin (a novel compound for BAT activation) treatment increased BAT activation, thereby it improved thermogenesis and systemic insulin sensitivity in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rat. In addition, the expression levels of ovarian steroidogenic enzymes such as P450C17, aromatase, 3\u03b2-HSD, 17\u03b2-HSD and STAR were up-regulated in rutin-treated PCOS rat. Furthermore, acyclicity and the serum level of luteinizing hormone were normalized, and a large number of mature ovulated follicle with a reduction of cystic formation were observed in PCOS rat after rutin treatment. Finally, rutin treatment surprisingly improved fertility and birth defect in PCOS rat. Collectively, our results indicate that rutin treatment significantly improves systemic insulin resistance and ovarian malfunction in PCOS, and our findings in this study provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of PCOS by activating BAT with rutin.",

        "abstract": "The strong effects of classic brown adipose tissue (BAT) and recruited beige adipocytes in treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome have been attracting increasing research interest. Cold treatment is an effective, convenient approach to stimulate BAT activity and induce white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. Here, we utilized prolonged cold exposure (from 2\u202fh to 2 weeks in a 4\u00b0 cold chamber) to elucidate dynamic changes in BAT and in WAT browning during acute and chronic cold exposure in mice. BAT mass decreased quickly, with reduced lipid droplet sizes within 8\u202fh of cold exposure owing to the utilization of BAT pre-storage triglycerides, and subsequently increased during prolonged cold exposure. These dynamic morphological changes in BAT were confirmed by gene expression changes in ADRB3 and PGC1\u03b1, while UCP1 and ELOVL3 expression was continuously up-regulated throughout the entire cold exposure period. Additionally, cold treatment increased BAT secretion of FGF21, which has been reported to activate beige adipocyte formation. Thus, to illustrate potential crosstalk between secreted BAT proteins (so-called BATokines) and beige adipogenesis during cold stress, we performed an interscapular BAT (iBAT) removal experiment in mice. Surprisingly, loss of classic iBAT enhanced WAT browning due to compensatorily increased sympathetic WAT input. Unexpectedly, we observed significantly reduced adiposity in the iBAT removal group compared with the control group. These results further suggest that WAT browning plays an important role in whole-body energy metabolism during cold acclimation, even without iBAT. Furthermore, our data imply that enhanced WAT browning may be an efficient therapeutic tool to combat obesity and related syndromes.",

In this study, rutin, a natural compound extracted from mulberry and a drug used as a capillary stabilizer clinically for many years without any side effects, regulated whole-body energy metabolism by enhancing BAT activity. Rutin treatment significantly reduced adiposity, increased energy expenditure, and improved glucose homeostasis in both genetically obese (Db/Db) and diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Rutin also induced brown-like adipocyte (beige) formation in subcutaneous adipose tissue in both obesity mouse models. Mechanistically, we found that rutin directly bound to and stabilized SIRT1, leading to hypoacetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 protein, which stimulated Tfam transactivation and eventually augmented the number of mitochondria and UCP1 activity in BAT.

In addition, beige adipocytes, brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), have also been shown to take part in whole body metabolism. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrated that transplantation or activation of BAT or/and beige adipocytes reversed obesity and improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, many genes involved in BATactivation and/or the recruitment of beige cells have been found, thereby providing new promising strategies for future clinical application of BAT activation to treat obesity and metabolic diseases. This review focuses on recent advances of BAT function in the metabolic aspect and the relationship between BAT and cancer cachexia, a pathological process accompanied with decreased body weight and increased energy expenditure in cancer patients. The underlying possible mechanisms to reduce BAT mass and its activity in the elderly are also discussed.",

We paid particular attention to fluvastatin sodium (FS), because as an inhibitor of the cellular hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, FS has already been approved for treatment of hypercholesteremia. We found that in the cellular levels, FS treatment significantly increased  expression and BAT activity in human brown adipocytes. Consistently, the expression of oxidative phosphorylation-related genes was significantly increased upon FS treatment without differences in adipogenic gene expression. Furthermore, FS treatment resisted to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain by activating BAT in the mice model. In addition, administration of FS significantly increased energy expenditure, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, we reveal that FS induced browning in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) known to have a beneficial effect on energy metabolism. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that as an effective BAT activator, FS may have great potential for treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

By using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified hollow gold nanoparticles (HAuNs-PEG) as the transport carriers, we prepared here the PPD-loaded HAuNs-PEG (HAuNs-PEG-PPD). And then we conducted a number of experiments to investigate the in vitro anti-laryngeal cancer effect (Hep-2 cell as a model) of HAuNs-PEG-PPD, such as using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect the sustained release effect, MTT assay to detect the inhibitory effect on the proliferation of Hep-2 cells, and flow cytometry to determine the apoptosis of Hep-2 cells. The results showed that HAuNs-PEG-PPD had an obvious sustained release effect. Compared with those in the control group, HAuNs-PEG group and PPD group, the survival rate of Hep-2 cells decreased and the apoptosis rate increased significantly ( p",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, template-free, reproducible and one-step synthesis of hydrophilic KGdF 4: Ln 3+ (Ln = Ce, Eu, Tb and Dy) nanoparticles (NPs) via a solution-based route at room temperature. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra are used to characterize the samples. The results indicate that the use of water-diethyleneglycol (DEG) solvent mixture as the reaction medium not only allows facile particle size control but also endows the as-prepared samples with good water-solubility. In particular, the mean size of NPs is monotonously reduced with the increase of DEG content, from 215 to 40 nm. The luminescence intensity and absolute quantum yields for KGdF 4: Ce 3+, Tb 3+ NPs increase remarkably with particle sizes ranging from 40 to 215 nm. Additionally, we systematically investigate the magnetic and luminescence properties of KGdF 4: Ln 3+ (Ln = Ce, Eu, Tb and Dy) NPs. They display paramagnetic and superparamagnetic properties with mass magnetic susceptibility values of 1.03 \u00d7 10 -4 emu g -1\u00b7Oe and 3.09 \u00d7 10 -3 emu g -1\u00b7Oe at 300 K and 2 K, respectively, and multicolor emissions due to the energy transfer (ET) process Ce 3+ \u2192 Gd 3+ \u2192 (Gd 3+) n \u2192 Ln 3+, in which Gd 3+ ions play an intermediate role in this process. Representatively, it is shown that the energy transfer from Ce 3+ to Tb 3+ occurs mainly via the dipole-quadrupole interaction by comparison of the theoretical calculation and experimental results. This kind of magnetic/luminescent dual-function materials may have promising applications in multiple biolabels and MR imaging. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The aim of this study was to investigate if DCs and DC subpopulations in recipient peripheral blood are effective diagnostic indicators of acute rejection following kidney transplantation.Immunofluorescent flow cytometry was used to classify white blood cells (WBCs), the levels of mononuclear cells and DCs (including the dominant subpopulations, plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC)) in peripheral blood at 0, 1, 7, and 28 days and 1 year after kidney transplantation in 33 patients. In addition, the blood levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 were monitored before and after surgery. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as normal controls. Patients were undertaking hemodialysis owing to uremia before surgery.The total number of DCs, pDC, and mDC in peripheral blood and the pDC/mDC ratio were significantly lower in patients than controls (P < 0.05). Peripheral DCs suddenly decreased at the end of day 1, then gradually increased through day 28 but remained below normal levels. After 1 year, levels were higher than before surgery but lower than normal. The mDC levels were higher in patients with acute rejection before and 1 day after surgery (P < 0.005). There was no significant difference in IL-10 and IL-12 levels between patients with and without acute rejection.The changes in DCs and DC subpopulations during the acute rejection period may serve as effective markers and referral indices for monitoring the immune state, and predicting rejection and reasonably adjusting immunosuppressants.",

There were 21 male and 9 female aged from 22 to 67 years old, with a mean of (46.3 +/- 10.0) years old. SRL was used in primary immunosuppression therapy to prevent acute rejection after surgery, and all of them were treated in combination with dose-reduced cyclosporine A (CsA) and steroid. CsA reduction began 3 months after the surgery, the weekly dose of CsA about 10 to 25 percent reduction until completely discontinued. During a 4-year follow-up period, the adverse events, acute rejection and infection were observed and recorded in detail. The graft function and other laboratory indicators were checked and analyzed.Of the 30 patients, 4 recipients died, patients survival rate was 86.7%. In other 26 cases, 25 recipients had good graft function, the average blood creatinine was (103.8 +/- 4.6) micromol/L at the end of 4(th) year and the incidence of acute rejection was 6.7% (2/30). The side effects included hyperlipidemia, proteinuria, delayed healing incision, lactate dehydrogenase increased and joint pain.The combination of sirolimus with dose-reduced CsA till completely discontinued and steroid to prevent acute rejection of kidney transplantation is safe and efficient.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the incidence and types of post-transplant malignancy in Chinese renal transplant recipients and the risk factors associated with malignancy. Data from 3,462 patients who underwent renal transplantation at Beijing Friendship Hospital were combined with data from 26 previous reports describing malignancy rates in 27,170 Chinese renal transplant recipients. Between 1974 and 2014, 179/3,462 (5.17 %) patients who underwent renal transplantation at our center developed malignancy. The most common site of malignancy was the urinary system, and the most common type was urothelial transitional cell carcinoma. Combined data from our center and previous reports showed malignancy in 671 (2.19 %) Chinese renal transplant recipients. The ten most common malignancies were urothelial transitional cell carcinoma (n = 283), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 68), gastrointestinal cancer (n = 63), renal cell carcinoma (n = 42), lymphoma (n = 42), lung cancer (n = 28), breast cancer (n = 19), skin cancer (n = 18), Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 12), and cervical cancer (n = 10). The incidence of post-transplant malignancy in renal transplant recipients was lower in China than the reported rates in other countries, and the most common sites of malignancy were the urinary and digestive system. The relative frequency of malignancy sites differed between northern and southern China. Renal transplant recipients on long-term immunosuppressive therapy should receive careful follow-up, including annual or biannual screening for malignancy in high-risk individuals.",

DCs ' quantity, subsets and mDC/pDC were detected using flow cytometry. 7 renal transplantation patients who had been survived over two years and 30 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of bladder were included in this research as long term control and common tumor control. 15 volunteers( control group) were studied as healthy controls. Results The levels of DCs of all the patients groups were lower than healthy people control group, the total mDC level of long term survival group was the lowest(P<0. 05). Compared with long term survival group, there was no difference in DCs with two subset of tumor groups( all P>0. 05). The pDC level of the transitional cell carcinoma patients after kidney transplantation was decreased and the ratio of mDC/pDC was significantly higher than other groups(allP>0.05). Different from carcinoma after kidney transplantation,mDC in patient with transitional cell carcinoma of bladder were decreased significantly and pDC level decreased slightly. After tumorectomy,mDC and pDC levels in both groups were increased with different extent.ConclusionsChanges in DCs and their subsets were different between the carcinoma patients after kidney transplantation and common transitional cell carcinoma of bladder. This difference suggested that disequilibrium of immune system of kidney transplant recipient should be response to carcinoma after kidney transplantation. Monitoring the level of DCs and subsets is helpful for the forecast of tumor immunity surveillance and cancer relapse.",

Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the cells were incubated in fresh culture medium containing 100 nmol/L progesterone for 24 h. The total RNA extract or whole cell lysate was prepared for detecting BRCA1, PRA and PRB expressions using RT-PCR and Western blotting.The protein expressions of PRA and PRB were significantly decreased whereas their mRNA expressions remained unchanged in MCF-7 cells overexpressing BRCA1. In MCF-7 cells with BRCA1 knock-down, in contrast, the PRA and PRB protein expressions were markedly increased.In breast cancer cells, exogenous and endogenous BRCA1 can both down-regulate the expressions of PRA and PRB at the protein level.",

Of the 9 patients, 7 were alive in postoperative follow-ups for 32-172 months, of whom 2 received hemodialysis after the removal of dysfunctional allograft, and 5 were alive with functioned allograft. Two patients died of tumor metastasis in 6 months after operations.The multiple accompanying malignancy can happen in patients who have developed UC after renal transplantation. The possibility of multiple malignancy occurrences should be regarded among renal transplant recipients, since early diagnosis and treatment are essential to the improvement in the survival of the patients.",

The patients with viremia were treated with Ganciclovir or foscarnet sodium., The patients with severe infections (eg. severe pulmonary infections) should be treated with decrease dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, even stop administration. Then the irnmunosilppressive drugs were adopted again if the infections were controlled. Twenty-four patients obtained the satisfied efficacy. The results suggested that evaluation of the risk for CMV infections before transplantation, preventive treatment in early time after transplantation, measurement of clinical epidemiology, early diagnosis, and individual medication scheme of immunosuppressive drugs for patients should be effective to prevent and against CMV infections.

Methods Five-hundred and four patients after renal transplantation were ramdomly divided into two groups. The routine prevention group (n=251) were received with glutathione 2 400 mg intravenously together with conventional medicine after renal transplantation. Non-prevention group (n=253) were not given any liver-protective agent in addition to routine medication. If the hepatic injury still appeared after conventional prevention,patients were randomly divided into two groups according to the different treatment options. Group A with 34 patients was received with bicyclol orally 75 mg daily for 8 weeks and group B with 34 patients was administrated with Tiopronin tablets 600 mg/d also for 8 weeks. Results The incidence of liver injury in routine prevention group is significantly lower than that of non-prevention group (P<0.01); for the patients with liver injury after routine prevention,additional treatment with bicyclol exhibited a clearly superior role in improving liver function and comprehensive therapeutic effect to Tiopronin (P<0.05,P<0.01). No obvious drug-related adverse events were found. Conclusion Glutathione can prevent early stage liver injury after renal transplantation. Combined therapy with bicyclol and glutathione can efficiently improve liver injury when routine prevention was invalid.",

In the 118 patients, diarrhea was probably caused by administration of immunosuppressive agents in 65 cases (55.08%), in 30 cases (25.42%) diarrhea was antibiotics associated, and in 23 cases (19.49%) it was due to infections, including bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Diarrhea occurred soon after transplantation in most cases. Of the 118 patients, the symptom of diarrhea occurred in the first 1 month in 84 cases (71.19%), and in the next 5 months in 16 cases (13.56%), and the other 18 cases (15.05%) occurred after 180 days after transplantation. Of the 118 patients, 84 cases (71.19%) were relieved or cured after proper diets, the symptomatic therapy or the adjust meat of the doses of immunosuppressive agents: 18 cases (15.25%) needed to use or adjust the antibiotics , 16 cases (13.56%) had to stop mycophenolate mofetil and convert to other drugs.Immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics and infection are the common causes of diarrhea after kidney transplantation. The outcome is good with appropriate conservative management.",

        "abstract": "It is controversial whether unilateral interruption of the arteria iliaca interna distal end affects penile hemodynamics and erectile function. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate this influence by detecting the blood flow of the penile artery before and after renal transplantation.Thirty-three patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) received renal transplantation, the grafts revascularized by end-to-end anastomosis to the right internal iliac artery. Six months before and after the surgery, we obtained the IIEF scores of the patients, recorded their penile blood flow on color Doppler ultrasonography and the levels of serum creatinine, hemoglobin and serum cholesterol, and analyzed post-transplantation immunosuppressive medication.The patients ranged in age from 21 to 55 years, of whom 36% had erectile dysfunction (ED) during MHD, and 33% after renal transplantation. A total of 67% of the renal transplant recipients (RTR) complained of unchanged and 15% deteriorated ED, while 18% admitted improved erectile function. The patients showed a significantly stronger sexual desire after the transplantation than before it (6.2 +/- 1.6 vs 8.9 +/- 0.9, P < 0.01). There was a significant decrease in peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the cavernous arteries after transplantation as compared with pre-transplantation (P < 0.01). Penile arterial blood flow insufficiency was found in none of the RTRs.Unilateral interruption of the internal iliac artery decreases penile arterial blood flow, but not to such a degree as to result in ED. Unilateral interruption of the arteria iliaca interna distal end does not affect the erectile function of RTRs.",

        "abstract": "Immunosuppressive treatment regimens are complex and require ongoing self-management. Medication adherence can be difficult to achieve for several reasons. The current meta-analysis and systematic review investigated whether adherence interventions improved immunosuppressive treatment adherence in kidney transplant recipients. Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched until October 17, 2016 using the following search terms: kidney transplantation, compliance, adherence, and immunosuppressive therapy. Randomized controlled trials and two-arm prospective, retrospective, and cohort studies were included. The primary outcomes were adherence rate and adherence score. Eight studies were included with a total for 546 patients. Among participants receiving intervention, the adherence rate was significantly higher than the control group (pooled OR=2.366, 95% CI 1.222 to 4.578, p=0.011). Participants in the intervention group had greater adherence scores than those in the control group (pooled standardized difference in means =1.706, 95% CI 0.346 to 3.065, p=0.014). Sensitivity analysis indicated that findings for adherence rate were robust. However, for adherence score, the significance of the association disappeared after removing one of the studies indicating the findings may have been overly influenced by this one study. Intervention programs designed to increase immunosuppressive adherence in patients with kidney transplant improve treatment adherence.",

        "title": "A Novel Surgical Option for Urinary Tract Reconstruction in Third Renal Transplantation.",
        "abstract": "Renal transplantation is generally accepted to be the best treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease, which is associated with better quality of life and better life expectancy compared with dialysis. Although the allograft survival following renal transplantation continues to improve, the absolute number of patients suffering from allograft loss continues to grow due to the increasing number of surviving renal transplant recipients. Thus, an increasing number of patients are willing to undergo renal re-transplantation. Due to the shortage of organ donors, the use of marginal donors including donors with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is becoming more prevalent.[1] An anastomosis of allograft pelvis to native ureter has been reported to be a treatment for donor kidney with UPJO at initial transplantation;[2] however, few studies focused on the surgical option for urinary tract reconstruction of donor kidney with UPJO in re-transplantation. The aim of this report was to provide and evaluate a novel surgical option for urinary tract reconstruction in third renal transplantation, using preexisting allograft ureteropyelostomy (UP), which we believe represents an innovative surgical technique for renal transplantation in the world.A 49-year-old male was diagnosed with renal allograft failure caused by chronic allograft nephropathy and commenced hemodialysis 3 times/week in 2013. This patient had undergone renal transplants twice in the past. Initial transplantation was performed in 1990, with allograft in the right iliac fossa. Dual transplantation was performed in 2003, with allograft in the left iliac fossa. The internal iliac artery and external iliac vein were used both in previous transplants. The allograft ureters were anastomosed to the bladder. Both allograft kidneys were preserved before third renal transplantation.Due to dialysis intolerance, this patient underwent a third renal transplant in 2013, from a donor after cardiac death, with normal renal function. The preoperative examination showed negative results on both lymphocytotoxicity and panel-reactive antibodies test. The donor\u2013recipient ABO was compatible. Furthermore, a computed tomography angiography of renal arteries was performed preoperatively. The surgery was performed through previous incision in the right lower abdomen. An allograft nephrectomy was performed at first, in which the middle and distal allograft ureters were preserved because the distal tissue was not dissociated [Figure 1a]. Subsequently, the third renal transplantation was performed. In this procedure, the external iliac artery and external iliac vein were used for anastomosis. After reperfusion of the allograft kidney, the function was recovered immediately. However, hydronephrosis was found unexpectedly, caused by a 5 cm-long congenital upper ureteral stricture of new allograft. The insertion of ureteric stent was failed due to the ureteral stricture. Thus, a ureteral resection was performed, leaving the pelvis for anastomosis [Figure 1b]. Unfortunately, bleeding during the dissociation of tissue due to the serious adhesions in the surgical field led to the failure of exposure of native ureter. While visual inspection found no obvious necrosis of preserved ureter following allograft nephrectomy, we anastomosed the preexisting allograft ureter to the new allograft pelvis for urinary tract reconstruction, with end-to-end anastomosis [Figure 1c], and no suture tension. A ureteric stent was placed in this procedure. The surgery was completed within 2.5 h and the amount of intraoperative bleeding was u003c100 ml.Figure 1(a) Left: before allograft nephrectomy; Right: after allograft nephrectomy. (b) Left: before ureteral resection; Right: after ureteral resection. (c) Preexisting allograft ureteropyelostomy.The immunosuppressive regimen included basiliximab 20 mg/d twice (day 0 and day 4), tacrolimus 6 mg/d, sirolimus 1 mg/d, mycophenolate mofetil 1500 mg/d, and prednisolone 30 mg/d. The patient was discharged 3 weeks postoperatively, with a serum creatinine level of 133.0 \u00b5mol/L. The ureteric stent was removed 6 weeks postoperatively. After 1 year of follow-up, he had a well-functioning allograft with a serum creatinine level of 140.0 \u00b5mol/L, and without ureteral necrosis, urinary leakage, ureteral obstruction, reflux, calculi, hematuria, or urinary infection.Re-transplants have been reported to account for 11.8% of all transplant recipients in the United States, and an increasing trend has been reported in previous studies. While a similar graft survival rate of third transplantation has been reported compared with initial transplantation, the clinical and surgical experience is still scarce due to a small amount of practice. A recent study on the third and fourth renal transplantation was performed by Halawa,[3] in which all ureters were implanted into the bladder dome using one of the standard techniques excluding orthotopic renal transplantation. However, with a greater acceptance of using marginal donor kidney, the presence of hydronephrotic kidney is no longer an absolute contraindication to kidney donation, which may lead to impossibility to perform ureterocystostomy. Thus, an alternative to ureterocystostomy for urinary tract reconstruction was needed.Although both native UP and ureteroureterostomy (UU) can be used for the management of donor kidney with anatomical abnormality, the serious adhesions in the surgical field in ipsilateral re-transplantation might lead to the failure of exposure of native ureter, which caused impossibility to perform native UP or UU routinely. There were also exceptions when the native urinary malformation existed which could not be used for anastomosis. In this report, we could not use the native ureter due to the serious adhesions. Besides, the native ureter was not investigated by retrograde pyeloureterography before re-operation, which was necessary for the use of native ureter. Thus, we chose a novel surgical alternative, using preexisting allograft UP. Visual inspection was necessary before anastomosis. This surgery must be performed according to the indications as follows: (1) ipsilateral re-transplantation (including multiple renal transplantation); (2) too short allograft ureter (including long or multi-segment ureteral strictures or complete ureteral necrosis); (3) patient with native urinary malformation (including vesicoureteral reflux and orthotopic or heterotopic diversion); (4) patient without preexisting allograft ureteral necrosis following allograft nephrectomy; and (5) patient without acute or chronic rejection. No need of further pelvic dissection for exposure of the bladder and avoidance of vesicoureteral reflux were advantages of this surgery.This surgery was performed successfully without any complications, especially ureteral necrosis, urinary leakage, and ureteral obstruction, which indicated a feasible surgery. However, a longer follow-up was needed. Unfortunately, further data were insufficient because the patient did not undergo computed tomography urography or magnetic resonance urography scan due to the economic concerns and burden of unnecessary investigations postoperatively.It is acknowledged that the transplant ureter is highly susceptible for damage due to reduced blood supply, because after explantation from donor, the only source of blood is from the renal pelvic vessels, which run in the periureteral adventitia. However, after 1 year of follow-up, neither necrosis nor stricture of the preexisting allograft ureter occurred following allograft nephrectomy, which raised a question whether there was another pathway for the blood supply of allograft ureter.Even though several studies demonstrated a well-recognized role for angiogenesis in diseases and therapies,[4,5] none of them discussed the correlation between blood supply and angiogenesis. We supposed that the angiogenesis might contribute to the blood supply of preexisting allograft ureter, although further studies are needed.In conclusion, this report revealed a novel surgical option for urinary reconstruction in third renal transplantation, using preexisting allograft UP, which was feasible as an alternative for urinary tract reconstruction in ipsilateral re-transplantation under certain conditions. Besides, this report also raised a question whether angiogenesis played a significant role in the blood supply of allograft ureter for long-term surviving recipients.Financial support and sponsorshipNil.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.",

We reviewed the records of 12 RT patients with metastatic or locally advanced UC who received chemotherapy at our institution since January, 2013. All the patients received intravenous gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8 and 15, plus cisplatin (70 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the curve = 5) on day 2, every 28 days. A total of 10 patients completed all the cycles, while 1 patient discontinued treatment due to disease progression and 1 patient discontinued due to non-medical reasons. In total, 12 patients received a median of four cycles of chemotherapy. The overall response rate was 50% (4/8 cases) in patients with measurable lesions. At the time of the study, 5 patients had succumbed to the disease (overall survival, 9.2 months), while 7 patients remained alive (follow-up time, 13.3 months). The most common toxicities were myelosuppression and gastrointestinal effects. Therefore, the GC/GCa regimen was found to be effective and tolerable in RT patients with UC. However, further studies involving more patients and control groups are required to confirm our results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Aim  This study aimed to explore depressive symptoms and associated factors among renal-transplant (RT) recipients in China.    Methods  This study included 287 RT recipients. Data were collected from August to November 2014 by utilizing demographic forms, namely, the Self-rating Depression Scale and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Descriptive statistics, Studentu0027s  t  test, Chi-square test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis.    Results  More than half of the recipients presented depressive symptoms. All recipients in the four transplant period groups (\u22645 yr, 5\u201310 yr, 10\u201315 yr, and u003e15 yr) reported greater depressive symptoms than the Norm. No significant difference was observed in the depressive symptoms in the four transplant period groups. Multiple linear regression indicated that depressive symptoms were significantly associated with employment status, economic burden, inhabitation area, and social support.    Conclusion  Depression is common among RT recipients in China. Employment status, economic burden, inhabitation area, and social support are the main factors affecting depression among RT recipients. Follow-up clinics should prescribe the evaluation of depression as a routine examination for RT patients. Moreover, depressed recipients must be provided with individualized care by collecting information on the depressive symptoms, employment status, economic burden, inhabitation area, and perceived social support of recipients.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the expression of ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2 (UHRF2) in colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues and estimated the clinicopathological significance and predictive value of UHRF2 expression in colon cancer. Using quantitative real-time PCR, tissue microarray (TMA), western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining, we evaluated UHRF2 mRNA and protein levels in tumor tissues and paired adjacent normal epithelium. We found that UHRF2 was upregulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in tumor tissues. Immunohistochemical detection of UHRF2 on a TMA containing 203 paired specimens showed that increased cytoplasmic UHRF2 was significantly associated with clinical stage, depth of invasion, nodal involvement, tumor histologic grade and the presence of metastasis. Patients with UHRF2-positive tumors had a much lower disease-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) 9.511, P<0.001] and overall survival (HR 9.820, P<0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the correlation between these parameters and the clinical and pathological variables of the study population verifying that UHRF2 immunoreactivity emerged as an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. UHRF2 may contribute to the progression of colon carcinogenesis and function as a novel prognostic indicator after curative operation.",

More studies are needed to document sleep quality after renal transplantation.A cross-sectional design was used in this study.A convenience sample of renal transplant recipients was recruited at an outpatient transplant clinic of a general hospital in Beijing, China. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure quality of sleep. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (MOS SF-36) was used to measure health-related quality of life.The average PSQI score of the 204 renal transplant recipients was 5.81\u00b13.52, significantly lower than the norm. Fifty (24.5%) recipients were classified as having poor sleep quality (global PSQI > 7). The mean scores of renal transplant recipients for SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) were 47.57\u00b16.71 and 48.26\u00b19.66 respectively. Compared with residents in Sichuan province, recipients' scores for SF-36 dimensions were statistically lower except the dimension of mental health. SF-36 scores of poor sleepers (PSQI > 7) were significantly lower than the good sleepers (PSQI \u2264 7) in both the MCS and PCS. Significant differences exist between the groups in physical function, bodily pain, vitality, and mental health dimensions.Sleep quality and HRQOL of patients after renal transplantation were lower than the norm. Poor sleep is associated with lower HRQOL.Health professionals need to pay attention to sleep quality and HRQOL in renal transplant recipients and take appropriate measures to improve patients' sleep quality and HRQOL.",

The effects of main factors on extraction were discussed and the optimum process conditions obtained as follows: the mass ratio of solvent to dry tobacco crude was 18: 1, extraction time was 5-6 h, heating temperature was about 10\u00b0C higher than boiling point of the solvent. The experimental results show that the yield of solanesol is 8.3% higher than that with other extractive methods, and the solvent recovery rate is increased by 2.3%. The continuous circulating extraction has less time and circulating solvent required, and can produce the products with stable quality. Therefore this continuous circulating extraction is a highly efficient method for extracting solanesol from biomass and can reduce the cost of solanesol production.",

The phase compositions and phase equilibrium curve of this ternary liquid-liquid equilibrium system were obtained. The experimental data were correlated by using UNIQUAC and NRTL models. Based on the model parameter correlated, the liquid compositions were calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental data. The average deviation is less than 0.003 8.The agreement between calculated and experimental data is satisfactory. The selectivity coefficients of the solvent to solutes were calculated. The results show that the glycerin is a good solvent to separate butanone and water.",

        "abstract": "The chemical functionalization of platinum (Pt) nanostructures is becoming a new trend in electrocatalysts designs. Meanwhile, highly branched Pt nanostructures are highly exciting electrocatalysts with high activity and stability owing to their specific physical and chemical properties. In this work, the polyallylamine (PAH) functionalized Pt nanolance assemblies (Pt NLAs) have been successfully synthesized by chemical reduction of PAH-Pt(II) complex using formaldehyde (HCHO) in a two-phase water-complex system. The as-prepared Pt NLAs are highly branched and three-dimensionally (3D) interconnected nanostructures, which are composed of many long Pt nanolances in various directions. PAH functionalization improves the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt NLAs for an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) because of high interface proton concentration on the Pt surface and excellent anti-oxidation ability of the Pt nanolances. Meanwhile, the PAH molecules bound on the Pt NLAs surface act as barrier networks to restrain accessibility of alcohol, exhibiting a high ORR selectivity. In addition, the PAH functionalized Pt NLAs show excellent durability for the ORR due to their particular 3D interconnected structure. The work demonstrates that the PAH functionalized Pt NLAs are indeed promising cathodic electrocatalysts for practical application in direct alcohol fuel cells.",

For both reactions, the polymerization extent decreased with the increase of pH. For the reaction of l -Cys, only mononuclear complex [Pt( l -Met-S,N)( l -Cys-S,N)] was observed when pH > 9.

        "abstract": "A phosphodiesterase model with two zinc centers has been synthesized and characterized. The compound, [Zn(2)(L(-)(2H))(AcO)(H(2)O)](PF(6)).2H(2)O (Zn(2)L'), was formed using an \"end-off\" type compartmental ligand, 2,6-bis{[(2-pyridylmethyl)(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]methyl}-4-methylphenol (L), and zinc acetate dihydrate. The X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that Zn(2)L' contains a mu-acetato-mu-cresolato-dizinc(II) core comprised of a quasi-trigonal bipyramidal Zn and a distorted octahedral Zn, and the distance between them is 3.421 Angstroms which is close to the dizinc distance in related natural metalloenzymes. Phosphodiesterase activity of Zn(2)L' was investigated using bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) as the substrate. The pH dependence of the BNPP cleavage in aqueous buffer media shows a sigmoid-shaped pH-k(obs) profile with an inflection point around pH 7.13 which is close to the first pK(a) value of 7.20 for Zn(2)L' obtained from the potentiometric titration. The catalytic rate constant (k(cat)) is 4.60 x 10(-6) s(-1) at pH 7.20 and 50 degrees C which is ca. 10(5)-fold higher than that of the uncatalyzed reaction. The deprotonated alcoholic group appended on Zn(2)L' is responsible for the cleavage reaction. The possible mechanism for the BNPP cleavage promoted by Zn(2)L' is proposed on the basis of kinetic and spectral analysis. The dizinc complex formed in situ in anhydrous DMSO exhibits a similar ability to cleave BNPP. This study provides a less common example for the phosphodiesterase model in which the metal-bound alkoxide is the nucleophile.",

        "abstract": "Two gold(III) compounds [Au(TACN)Cl(2)]Cl (1) and [Au(TACN)Cl(2)][AuCl(4)] (2) (where TACN=1,4,7-triazacyclononane), have been synthesized and characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), (1)H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The structure of compound 2 was determined by X-ray crystallography, in which TACN coordinates to the gold(III) center in a bidentate mode and the unbound amine group forms a very short intramolecular Au-H(-N) contact (1.91A). Biological activity data showed that compound 1 is more cytotoxic than cisplatin against A-549 and HCT-116 tumor cell lines. The interactions of compound 1 with CT-DNA were studied by UV-Vis, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, which suggests that compound 1 can induce the distortion of DNA double helix.",

        "abstract": "Four gold(III) complexes of terpyridine derivatives 1-4 have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods. In vitro data demonstrated that all of them showed higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin against the human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line (A-549), the human stomach carcinoma cell line (SGC-7901), the human cervix carcinoma cell line (HELA), the human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116), the human liver carcinoma cell line (BEL-7402), the murine leukemia cell line (P-388) and the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60). Complex 3 exhibits the highest activity, with growth inhibition rates of over 80% at 10(-8) mol L(-1) against the A-549, HCT-116 and HELA tumor cell lines. Interestingly, ligands L1-L4 are also very cytotoxic against the cell lines tested. Complexes 1-4 are stable in aqueous solution for 2 days in the presence of the biological reducing agent glutathione. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry data showed that DNA isolated from cells treated with complexes 1 and 3 contained gold with gold-to-nucleotide ratios of approximately 1:6,400 and 1:4,900, respectively. Fluorescence titration, UV and circular dichroism analyses proved that the steric and electrostatic effects of the ligand remarkably influence the interactions of their gold(III) complexes with DNA. The DNA binding ability of the complexes has been correlated with their cytotoxicity, which could potentially provide a new rationale for the future design of terpyridine-based metal complexes with antitumor potential.",

Crystallographic data reveal that complex I, [Cu(L1)(Ac)(H2O)], is penta-coordinated with a square-pyramidal geometry while complexes V [Cu(L2')(H2O)] and VI [Cu(L3')(H2O)] are tetra-coordinated to give square planar geometry. In vitro tests showed that the Cu(II) complexes with L1 (I-IV) exhibited cytotoxicity at a concentration of 10(-8) M against murine leukemia P-388 and human leukemia HL-60 cell lines, which is more potent than cisplatin. However, ligands HL2 and HL3 and their corresponding copper complexes demonstrated very weak in vitro activities towards the cell lines examined.

In this work, the crystal structures of DANQUIN, Cu(DANQUIN)2 and Cu(DANPY)2 (DANPY, N-2-picolyl-(50-N,N-dimethylamino-1 0-naphthalene)-sulfonamide) are reported and compared with the simu- lated structure of Zn(DANQUIN)2, which is important for the understanding of the factors that govern the fluorescence of DANQUIN. Free DANQUIN mainly displays the fluorescence of the dansyl group at 547 nm while the Zn(II)-DANQUIN complex mainly shows the enhanced fluorescence of aminoquinoline at 469 nm, while the emission of the dansyl group shifted to 517 nm with an almost constant intensity. This result demonstrates the advantage of this hybrid fluorescent chemosensor for Zn(II), and also makes it a potential can- didate for ratiometric Zn(II) detection. \ufffd 2006 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "A novel hexadentate ligand, N,N,N',N',N\",N\"-hexa(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)benzene (L), was designed and synthesized. The X-ray structure analysis reveals that the three dipyridylamine (DPA) groups of L are almost perpendicular to the central trimethylenebenzene, and two of them are spacially close to each other while the third one is further apart. The trinuclear Pt(II) complexes [Pt(3)LCl(6)] (1) and [Pt(3)L(CBDCA)(3)] (2) (where CBDCA represents cyclobutane dicarboxylic acid) were prepared and fully characterized by IR, NMR, and ESMS spectroscopy. A mononuclear complex, [PtL(CBDCA)] (3), was also prepared and structurally characterized, which suggests that controlled formation of mono-, di-, and trinuclear complexes with L is possible. Spectroscopic data showed that complexes 2 and 3 are able to bind to calf thymus DNA and their CBDCA group can be readily replaced by thiourea.",

The dominant products for both reactions are bis-chelated complexes [Pt(L-Se-Met)2] and [Pt(L-Met)2].

In vitro cell growth inhibition tests of complexes 1 and 2 exhibited moderate antitumor activities against the melanoma B16-BL6 cell line.

Methods: Mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was selected as the effective cell of TGF-beta1. After the cells were treated.[3H]-Thymidine copration assays was used for examining the cell proliferation. RT-PCR employed for determining the levels of TGF-beta1 receptor mRNAs. Results: After the MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with TGF-beta1 at the dosages of 1 0 ng/mlfor 24h,[3H]-Thymidine copration assays increased markedly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). the levels of TGF-beta1 receptors mRNA increased significantly (P < 0.01). Conclusions: TGF-beta1 at the dosages of 10ng/mL showed the effects on promoting proliferation,which probably leaded to the maintenance of high TGF-beta1 receptors levels. TGF-beta1 receptor I gene expression at the level of transcription was up regulated in the MC3T3-E1 cell treated with dosage of TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ml) and TGF-beta1 receptor \u2161 mRNA was also,which might be one of the mechanisms for the maintenance of high TGF-beta1 receptor levels.TGF-beta1 (10 ng/ml) induce immediate early gene expression and growth in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts primarily through pathway of TGF-beta1 receptors.",

We investigated inhibitory effects of EuO leaf ethanol extracts on H2O2-induced apoptosis in rat osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and underlying mechanisms. Locally-grown Duzhong leaves were extracted\n with ethanol. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with EuO (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h, and then H2O2 (800 \u03bcmol/L) for an additional 24 h. Cell survival rate, percentage of apoptosis, and expressions of caspases 3, 6, 7, and\n 9 were examined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, microscopic analysis, Western\n blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The final EuO leaf ethanol extract powder was detected\n to contain caffeotannic acid at 58 mg/g and geniposide at 3.45 mg/g by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). EuO\n remarkably restrained cell oxidative damage and increased cell survival rate in a dose-dependent manner: 0 \u03bcg/ml, 0.21; 6.25\n \u03bcg/ml, 0. 28; 12.5 \u03bcg/ml, 0.31; 25 \u03bcg/ml, 0.48; 50 \u03bcg/ml, 0.54; and 100 \u03bcg/ml, 0.66 (P<0.05), with the half-effective concentration being around 25 \u03bcg/ml. MTT results were confirmed by microscopic analysis. Western\n blotting and RT-PCR analyses showed that the expressions of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9 were significantly decreased in the EuO-treated\n cells compared with the control (EuO- and H2O2-free) (P<0.05), with the half-effective concentration of EuO ranging from 12.5 to 25 \u03bcg/ml. We conclude that the ethanol-extracted\n EuO leaf extracts promoted the growth of MC3T3-E1 cells, and suppressed the H2O2-induced apoptosis in a rat MC3T3-E1 osteogenic cell model, likely due to the inhibition of caspases\u2019 activities.

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the correlation between severe pre-eclampsia and the changes of factors such as GMP-140,D-dimer (D-D) in pro-coagulation. Methods 200 pregnant women of 20 to 36 gestational weeks were collected and classified into 4 groups according to the gestational weeks. PT,APTT,and the level of PLT,GMP-140,D-D,FIB in the peripheral blood were detected. The pregnant women who had two or more abnormal indexes were considered as high risk,and were divided into two groups randomly. The treatment group was dealt with intravenous drip of heparin and salvia,while the control group was given normal sodium instead. The indexes of blood coagulation system were measured dynamically and the disease incidence was collected. Results The levels of PLT,PT and APTT were significantly lower in heavy pre-eclampsia patients (P<0.05),with the concentrations of GMP-140 and D-D in plasma significantly higher (P<0.05),compared to the control group. As for predicting,when the level of GMP-140 greater than or equal to 68.0 lg/L and D-D greater than or equal to 0.28mg/L,the positive predictive value of the incidence of heavy pre-eclampsia was 55.5% while the negative predictive value reached 78.1%. The specificity and sensitivity were 51.3% and 81.2% in the first group,respectively. In the second group,these indexes were 82.1%,79.3%,68.2% and 84.4% respectively. In the third group ,they were 85.3%,83.1%,76.4% and 85.3% respectively. In the forth group ,they were 87.2%,89.1%,80.8% and 90.6% respectively. The incidence rate of severe pre-eclampsia was 7.5% in the treatment group and 17.76% in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). Conclusion GMP-140 and D-D are two reliable indicators for pre-eclampsia in patients of pre-coagulation. Moreover,the incidence of pre-eclampsia can be degraded if heparin and salvia are used early.",

The concentration of IL-17 in peritoneal fluid was significantly higher when endometriosis and infertility coexist. However, the concentration of IL-17 in peritoneal fluid did not correlate with the phase of the menstrual cycle in the patients with or without endometriosis.

        "abstract": "The phytoene-related desaturases are the key enzymes in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. The gene encoding phytoene desaturase in the deinoxanthin synthesis pathway of Deinococcus radiodurans was identified and characterized. Two putative phytoene desaturase homologues (DR0861 and DR0810) were identified by analysis of conserved amino acid regions, and the former displayed the highest identity (68 %) with phytoene desaturase of the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus. DR0861 gene knockout and dinucleotide-binding motif deletion resulted in the arrest of lycopene synthesis and the accumulation of phytoene. The colourless DR0861 knockout mutant became more sensitive to acute ionizing radiation and oxygen stress. Complementation of the mutant with a heterologous or homologous gene restored its pigment and resistance. The desaturase activity of DR0861 (crtI) was further confirmed by the assay of enzyme activity in vitro and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli containing crtE and crtB genes (responsible for phytoene synthesis) from Erwinia uredovora. In addition, the amount of lycopene synthesis in E. coli resulting from the expression of crtI from D. radiodurans was determined, and this had significant dose-dependent effects on the survival rate of E. coli exposed to hydrogen peroxide and ionizing radiation.",

ARMS-PCR (Amplification Refractory Mutation System Polymerase chain reactions) and DNA sequencing were performed to detect polymorphism of-1082G/A site; PCR-RFLP was used to determine the genotypes in-819T/C and-592A/C sites. The serum and peritoneal fluid IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA.Results Three kinds of haplotypes (GCC,ACC and ATA) were found in both groups. Among six kinds haplotypes that have been discovered in present research,ATA/ATA,ATA/ACC and ACC/ACC were the most popular; GCC/ACC and GCC/ATA were less and GCC/GCC was the least. The polymorphism of-1082 site was associated with the serum and peritoneal fluid IL-10 production in controls (P<0.01). In \u2162~\u2163 EMs patients the polymorphisms of \u20131082 (GG or AG genotypes),\u2013819 (CC or TC genotypes) and \u2013592 (CC or AC genotypes) were associated with the increase of IL-10 levels in peritoneal fluid (P<0.05),but in\u2160~\u2161EMs patients only the polymorphism of \u20131082 was associated with the expression of IL-10 protein in peritoneal fluid. There was no correlation between IL-10 promoter polymorphisms and the serum IL-10 production in EMs group (P>0.05). Conclusion The production of IL-10 in controls was mostly regulated by the polymorphism of-1082 site,but in the pathologic conditions,such as endometriosis,not only the polymorphism in-1082 site but also that in-819 and-592 sites may regulate the production of IL-10. There was no correlation between IL-10 promoter polymorphisms and the serum IL-10 production in endometriosis,suggesting that there may be more than one mechanism to regulate the level of IL-10 in serum.",

        "abstract": "Danazol, a synthetic steroid with antigonadotrophic properties, has been widely used for the treatment of endometriosis and adenomyosis. However, the local application of danazol to the uterus to treat adenomyosis is controversial. The objective of this study is to develop an effective treatment for adenomyosis using danazol via intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) delivery.An adenomyosis animal model was established using Institute for Cancer Research, Swiss-derived (ICR) mice, grafted with a single pituitary gland (n = 30). Four months after grafting, IUCDs with three different quantities of danazol were prepared and used to treat the ICR mice with adenomyosis. After 2 months of treatment with a danazol-loaded IUCD, the number of adenomyosis nodules and the hematoxylin-eosin staining scores were measured and compared with mice given daily oral danazol and controls (no adenomyosis).As the danazol dose increased, the nodule number decreased reaching significance at a dose of 2.0 mg per 20 g body weight (P = 0.002). When compared with oral administration, the plasma danazol concentrations with IUCD delivery were low and stable.These results suggest that an IUCD loaded with an appropriate dose of danazol may be an effective treatment for adenomyosis and that human trials are warranted.",

In these patients, the square flap method, consisting of one rhombic flap and four triangular flaps, designed on the soft palate across the defect, was applied to the von Langenbeck procedure. After incisions, the flaps were rotated and advanced, and each flap was inserted into the opposite side and then sutured. The patients were followed from 6 months to 2 years, the velopharyngeal closure was examined by nasopharyngeal fiberscope and/ or x-ray radiography, and a clinical speech evaluation was performed.In all cases, no problem of flap viability was encountered and all healed well. The postoperative results were satisfactory without any complications such as dehiscence, perforation, palatal fistula, or functional disturbance. The velopharyngeal closure and clinical speech evaluation were satisfactory, and the effects of the operation were stable.The technique presented has been effective, with the advantages of palatal closure without tension, good muscular reconstruction, and sufficient lengthening of the soft palate.",

Bone formation induced by collagen/BMP composites was found as woven bone between 4 and 6 weeks; cartilaginous osteogenesis was the main type of bone formation; microvessels could be seen in the bony tissues; and the bone defects were healed completely 6 weeks after operation. Bone formation induced by collagen/BMP composites in the muscles can be used as a donor to repair the bone defect.",

        "abstract": "Deinococcus radiodurans is highly resistant to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant effect of carotenoids in D. radiodurans was investigated by using a targeted mutation of the phytoene synthase gene to block the carotenoid synthesis pathway and by evaluating the survival of cells under environmental stresses. The colorless mutant R1DeltacrtB of D. radiodurans failed to synthesize carotenoids, and was more sensitive to ionizing radiation, hydrogen peroxide, and desiccation than the wild type, suggesting that carotenoids in D. radiodurans help in combating environmental stresses. Chemiluminescence analyses showed that deinoxanthin, a major product in the carotenoid synthesis pathway, had significantly stronger scavenging ability on H2O2 and singlet oxygen than two carotenes (lycopene and beta-carotene) and two xanthophylls (zeaxanthin and lutein). Deinoxanthin also exhibited protective effect on DNA. Our findings suggest that the stronger antioxidant effect of deinoxanthin contribute to the resistance of D. radiodurans. The higher antioxidant effect of deinoxanthin may be attributed to its distinct chemical structure which has an extended conjugated double bonds and the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-1' position, compared with other tested carotenoids.",

        "abstract": "In eukaryotes, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, which resides at the crossroads of DNA repair and checkpoint signaling,\n rapidly forms prominent foci at damage sites following double-strand break (DSB) induction. This complex carries out the initial\n processing of the DSB ends. Mutations in the genes that encode components of this complex result in DNA-damage hypersensitivity,\n genomic instability, telomere shortening, and aberrant meiosis. Therefore, the MR proteins are highly conserved during evolution.\n The bacterial orthologs of Mre11 and Rad50 are the SbcD and SbcC proteins, respectively. Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremely radioresistant bacterium, is able to mend hundreds of radiation-induced DSBs. The SbcD and SbcC proteins were\n identified as the products of the Dr1921 and Dr1922 genes. Disruption of the sbcD gene, by direct reverse-orientation insertional mutagenesis technology, remarkably increases the cells\u2019 sensitivity to various\n types of DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and mitomycin C. We\n also provide evidence that the drSbcD protein plays an important role in both growth and DNA repair in this organism, especially\n in repair of DSBs generated after cellular exposure to 6000 Gy of IR. These results demonstrate that the drSbcD protein plays\n an important role in DSBs repair in D. radiodurans.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of Tooth Mousse (TM) application, smear layer removal, and storage time on resin-dentin microtensile bond strength (\u00b5TBS). Dentin specimens were divided into two groups: (1) smear layer covered; (2) smear layer removed using 15% EDTA for 90 s. In each group, half the specimens were treated once with TM for 60 min. After bonding procedures using a two-step self-etching adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond (CSE); Kuraray Medical, Tokyo, Japan), an all-in-one adhesive (G-Bond (GB); GC Corp, Tokyo, Japan), and a total-etch adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2 (SB); 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), the specimens were stored for 3 d or 6 months in deionized water at 37 \u00b0C, and \u00b5TBS was tested and analyzed. With the exception of SB (no TM application) and GB, the \u03bcTBS was significantly increased for CSE and SB using EDTA pre-conditioning and 3 d of storage (P\u22640.001). Bond strength of GB decreased significantly when using EDTA (3 d storage, P<0.05). TM application only increased the \u03bcTBS of GB (no EDTA) and SB (with EDTA) after 3 d (P\u22640.02). Comparing the adhesives after 3 d of storage, CSE exhibited the greatest \u03bcTBS values followed by GB and SB (P\u22640.02). The factors of adhesive, EDTA, and TM did not show any significant impact on \u03bcTBS when specimens were stored for 6 months (P>0.05). The additional application of TM and EDTA for cavity preparation seems only to have a short-term effect, and no influence on \u00b5TBS of dentin bonds after a period of 6 months.",

Amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reactions (ARMS-PCR) and DNA sequencing were performed to detect polymorphism of -1082G/A site and PCR-RFLP was used to determine the genotypes in -819T/C and -592A/C sites. One hundred and nineteen Chinese women with different stage EMs and 120 controls were employed in this study. Although there were no significant differences in the polymorphism of -1082 site between two groups (P>0.05), the frequencies of -819C, -592C alleles and -819 CC+TC, -592 CC+AC genotypes were significantly increased in EMs patients compared with the controls (P<0.05). The frequencies of -819C, -592C alleles and -819 CC+TC, -592 CC+AC genotypes were significantly increased in III-IV EMs patients compared with I-IIMs or controls (P<0.01). This suggests that polymorphisms of IL-10-819 (T/C) and -592 (A/C) may be associated with the susceptibility to EMs in Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is typically characterized by multifocal locations. It has been shown that CCR1, combined highly with RANTES, contributes to the enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells at endometriotic sites. As an estrogen-dependent disorder, estrogen receptors are also crucial to the growth of endometriotic tissues. In this study we report the immunohistochemical analysis of RANTES, CCR1, ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 in 48 histological lesions prepared from women with DIE undergoing surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis of RANTES, CCR1, ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 was conducted at different sites of DIE lesions. RANTES was immunolocalized in the cytoplasm and CCR1 in cytomembranes of endometriotic cells. ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2 extensively immunostained the nuclei of endometrial glandular, and stromal cells. Immunoreactivity in DIE lesions, similar to the widespread ERs, showed higher expression of RANTES and CCR1 in three types of DIE lesions. There was a significant correlation, independent of cyclic changes, between the expression of RANTES/CCR1 and DIE lesions. RANTES/CCR1 increased significantly according to the severity of dysmenorrhea. RANTES and CCR1 together may provide a potential biomarker for DIE-related pain and inflammatory response in endometriotic lesions of patients with DIE.",

Adenomyosis, also called endometriosis interna, occurs when the endometrium invades the myometrium. The objective of this study was to determine CCR1 expression in endometrium in women with adenomyosis as compared to women without adenomyosis. We evaluated endometrial mRNA and protein expression in women with and without adenomyosis using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis, respectively. We detected CCR1-immunoreactive expression in endometrium in all women with and without adenomyosis. CCR1-immunoreactive staining in endometrial cells was significantly higher in women with adenomyosis (4.89\u00b11.06) compared to those without adenomyosis (2.21\u00b11.16, P<0.001). Women with adenomyosis had higher levels of CCR1 mRNA in endometrium compared to women without adenomyosis (P<0.05). CCR1 protein levels in endometrium were significantly higher in women with adenomyosis (1.66\u00b10.79) compared to women without adenomyosis (0.56\u00b10.13, P<0.001), and positively correlated with the severity of dysmenorrhea (r=0.87, P<0.001).

        "abstract": "The modulating attributes of steroid receptor RNA activator protein (SRAP) on steroid receptors have been shown in some types of tumor cells. There is compelling evidence to suggest that this molecule may play a critical role in the development of the tumor. However, little has been reported on its expression in endometriosis associated ovarian clear cell carcinoma (EAOCCC). In order to investigate the role of SRAP and estrogen receptors (ERs) in EAOCCC, we have analyzed the distribution of these proteins in the malignant transformation tissues and endometrioma tissues by immunohistochemistry. Our results revealed that the positive ratio of ER-\u03b2 expression was gradually reduced during the malignant transformation from endometriosis to atypical endometriosis to clear cell carcinoma. Conversely, during the process, a gradual increase in SRAP expression was observed. Furthermore, there is a negative relationship between the expressions of these two molecules. Overall an increase in SRAP and a reduction in ER-\u03b2 expression might be associated with malignant transformation of EAOCCC.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the influence of ovarian endometrioma on expression of steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), estrogen receptors (ERs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) in the surrounding ovarian tissues. Taken from the women with ovarian endometrioma and mature teratoma during laparoscopy, the biopsies were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Our results indicated that ovarian tissues surrounding endometrioma had lower SRA and ER-\u03b1 levels but higher SRA protein (SRAP) and ER-\u03b2 levels than ovarian endometrioma. With lower VEGF levels and higher TSP-1 levels, the surrounding ovarian tissues showed higher expression levels of SRA, SRAP, ER-\u03b1, and ER-\u03b2 in the ovarian endometrioma group when compared to the controls. These data showed that ovarian endometrioma increases SRA, ERs, and TSP-1 but decreases VEGF levels in the surrounding ovarian tissues, suggesting that abnormal expression of these molecules may affect biological behaviors of ovarian endometrioma.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the difference of Twist gene promoter methylation among ovarian ectopic endometrium, eutopic endometrium and non-endometriosis (EMs) endometrium . 15 patients with reproductive age hospitalized at Department of obstetrics and gynecology affiliated to Medicine School of Zhejiang University from January 2013 to June 2016 were selected. Among them, 5 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery due to ovarian type EMs, and were selected after histologic confirmation. Ectopic endometrium and eutopic endometrium were obtained simultaneously. Normal endometrium was obtained from 5 cases of tubal infertility confirmed by hysteroscopy. Six pairs of primers for CpG island of Twist gene promoter were designed, and the difference of promoter methylation levels was detected by pyrosequencing method for methylation specific PCR (MSP) in three groups of endometrial tissues. The promoter of Twist gene is hypomethylated in some areas of ovarian ectopic endometrium and eutopic endometrium of ovarian endometriosis. It is speculated that the regional hypomethylation of Twist gene promoter in ovarian ectopic endometrium and eutopic endometrium may cause over-expression of Twist protein, which may directly lead to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.",

        "abstract": "G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1, formerly known as GPR30) has been proposed as the receptor for estrogen-induced, growth of leiomyomas though its precise mechanisms of action are not clear. We obtained leiomyoma cells (LC) and normal smooth muscle cells from 28 women (n\u2009=\u200928, median age 38 years, median parity 1.0). We incubated them with 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E(2)), after blocking, or upregulating, expression of GPER-1 with ICI182,780 (a GPER-1 agonist) and siGPR30, respectively. We evaluated the role of GPER-1 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway using Western blot analysis. We studied cell proliferation with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, and, mitotic activity with phosphohistone H3 (PPH3) expression in leiomyoma, and, matched, normal, smooth muscle tissues using standard immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of GPER-1 expression with siGPR30 partially attenuated the E(2)-activated MAPK signaling pathway (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Upregulation of GPER-1 with ICI182,780 enhanced the E(2)-activated MAPK signaling pathway (p\u2009<\u20090.01). ICI182,780 enhanced E(2)-induced proliferation of LC (p\u2009<\u20090.01), while knock down of the GPER-1 gene with GPER-1 small interfering RNA partially inhibited E(2)-induced cell proliferation (p\u2009<\u20090.01). There were no significant differences in PPH3 expression between LCs and normal smooth muscle tissues (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Neither ICI182,780 nor siGPR30 increased mitosis in LCs (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Our results indicate that GPER-1 mediates proliferation of estrogen-induced, LC by activating the MAPK pathway, and, not by promoting mitosis.",

Two-step Envision immunohistochemical staining was used to detect distribution of nerve fibers in endometrium. Highly specific polyclonal rabbit anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) and monoclonal mouse anti-neurofilament protein (NF) were used to demonstrate both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers in endometrium in women with adenomyosis and uterine fibroids.The positive rate of PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium of pain patients were with 64% (14/22) in adenomyosis and 67% (10/15) in uterine fibroids. And their density were 0.6 (0 - 9.4)/mm(2) and 0.6 (0 - 6.0)/mm(2) without reaching statistical difference (P > 0.05). No expression of NF could be detected in the functional layer of endometrium of adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. There were no PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium in non-pain women with adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. Moreover, No NF immunoreactive nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium were shown in non-pain patients with adenomyosis and uterine fibroids. PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers and the nerve density in the basal layer of endometrium were 64% (14/22), 1.1 (0 - 12.0)/mm(2) in pain adenomyosis and 50% (5/10), 0.6 (0 - 3.0)/mm(2) in non-pain adenomyosis. NF immunoreactive nerve fibers and the density in the basal layer of endometrium were 23% (5/22), (0 - 0.6)/mm(2) in pain adenomyosis and 20% (2/10), (0 - 1.0)/mm(2) in non-pain adenomyosis. PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers and the nerve density in the basal layer of endometrium were 80% (12/15) and 1.6 (0 - 10.0)/mm(2) in pain fibroids and 44% (12/27), 0 (0 - 5.0)/mm(2) in non-pain fibroids.

There was no statistical different PGP9.5 and NF immunoreactive nerve fibers distribution in basal layer of endometrium between pain adenomyosis and pain fibroids or between non-pain adenomyosis and non-pain fibroids (all P > 0.05). However, PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers density in basal layer of endometrium was higher in pain adenomyosis and fibroids when compared with non-pain adenomyosis and fibroids (P < 0.05).PGP9.5 immunoreactive nerve fibers might confer the occurrence of pelvic pain, however, NF immunoreactive nerve fibers may not involved in the pathogenesis of pain.",

Frequency of premalignant and malignant histopathologic features in endometrial polyps was calculated. Clinical risk factors for premalignant and malignant endometrial polyps were analyzed. Endometrial polyps were histologically benign in most patients (96.21%). Hyperplasia with atypia in a polyp (premalignant polyp) was found in 3.26% of patients, and endometrial carcinoma in a polyp (malignant polyp) was detected in only 0.52% of patients. Independent variables that were significantly related to premalignant and malignant polyps (all p<.05) in a binary logistic regression analysis included polyp diameter (odds ratio [OR], 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.191-7.20), menopause status (OR, 4.85; 95% CI, 2.09-11.27), and abnormal uterine bleeding (OR, 3.97; 95% CI, 1.71-9.18).Polyp diameter larger than 1.0cm, menopause status, and abnormal uterine bleeding may increase the risk of premalignant and malignant endometrial polyps.",

The changes of cell migration were detected by cell pseudopod formation, scratch test and transwell cell migration test.The expression of PRL-3 protein significantly decreased in the experimental group versus two other control groups (P < 0.05). The formation of cell pseudopod was much less in experimental group than that in control groups. Within the same time, the number of migration cells was 0.87 \u00b1 0.21 in experimental group. It was less than 1.75 \u00b1 0.28 in blank control group and 1.63 \u00b1 0.39 in negative control group (P < 0.05).PRL-3 siRNA can down-regulate the PRL-3 gene and decrease the migratory capacity of endometriotic stromal cells.

Positive correlation was found between the expression of SOCS-3 and caspase-3 proteins in ectopic endometrium (r = 0.655, P < 0.01).SOCS-3 may be involved in the development of endometriosis through inhibition of apoptosis of ectopic endometrial cells.",

The myomas were classified according to the Classification of the European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy (ESGE) and our group's new classification, which consists of five parameters. The possibility of total resection of submucous myoma, the operating time and the frequency of any complications were considered.The ESGE classification showed significant differences between the level 0 and level I or II (both P < 0.01). Hysteroscopic myomectomy was considered incomplete in 9 patients with myomas. The numbers of complete surgeries of level II was significant lower compared to level 0 or level I (P < 0.01). Using our new classification, the differences of both operating times and the numbers of complete surgeries between group B and A was significant (P < 0.01).The new classification gives more clues as to the difficulties of hysteroscopic myomectomy than the standard ESGE classification. Although a larger number of patients need to be evaluated by this classification.",

        "abstract": "Aquaporin (AQP)-dependent cell migration has broad implications in angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, wound healing, glial scarring and other events requiring cell movement. There are 13 isoforms of AQP (0-12) that have been identified in mammals. It is unclear whether AQP5 plays a role in the development of endometrial cancer. We recently demonstrated that ovarian steroids may affect the expression of AQP5 in the female genital tract. In this study, we considered whether AQP5 may affect cell migration in Ishikawa cells, an adenocarcinoma cell line derived from the endometrium. The results showed that the downregulation of AQP5 results in reduced Ishikawa cell migration. The estrogen (E2) receptor in the promoter of AQP5 mediated the regulation of AQP5 expression in the normal endometrium and endometrial cancer. By contrast, the upregulation of AQP5 by E2 increased cell migration, invasion and adhesion through increased annexin-2, which is responsible for F-actin remodeling and rearrangement. E2 regulates Ishikawa cell migration by regulating the AQP5 expression.",

        "abstract": "Loading of an appropriate amount of rhBMP-2 and avoiding its \"burst-release\" are key challenges for upgrading the biological performance of thin bioactive coatings on metal implants. In this study, we adopted incorporation of chitosan nanospheres into thin mineralized collagen coatings to enhance rhBMP-2 loading and improve releasing behavior based on the good affinity of chitosan for proteins and the large surface area of nanospheres. We realized the incorporation process by electrophoretic injection. Using chitosan nanospheres, we were able to increase the rhBMP-2 loading amount in the thin coating by 2.7-fold (from 446 ng cm to 1186 ng cm), and showed that the rhBMP-2 exhibited sustained release behavior. MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on the rhBMP-2/chitosan nanosphere-incorporated thin coatings (Col/Cs/BMP) showed good cell attachment and proliferative behavior, and high levels of differentiation and mineralization. In in vivo tests, spiral CT analysis and histological observations demonstrated that Col/Cs/BMP coatings on metal implants were able to increase bone density and accelerate new bone growth after implantation for 4 to 8 weeks, and the boundary between host bones and new bones disappeared after implantation for 8 weeks. The pull-out tests further confirmed that the Col/Cs/BMP coatings could significantly enhance osseointegration. The present results indicate that incorporation of chitosan nanospheres into thin coatings is an effective way to enhance the loading amount properly, improve the release behavior of rhBMP-2 and finally accelerate the osseointegration process.",

        "abstract": "Mineralized collagen coatings were synthesized by electrochemical deposition with alternating negative and positive potentials. The obtained coatings demonstrated a multi-layer structure alternating consisting of weakly and highly mineralized collagen layers and the proportion of each layer could be controlled by adjusting the deposition time. The coatings deposited using alternating potentials assisted electrochemical deposition (AP-ECD) showed significantly enhanced osteoblasts proliferation, and rhBMP-2 loading capability compared to those of the coatings deposited using constant potential electrochemical deposition (CP-ECD). The enhanced cytocompatibility and rhBMP-2 loading capability of the coatings might be attributed to their high proportion of weakly mineralized collagen layer. Furthermore, the deposition mechanism for alternating potentials is proposed as that positive potential induces deposition of negatively charged collagen fibrils to form a weakly mineralized collagen layer. Our results suggest that the present deposition method could be a promising approach to engineer mineralized collagen coating with better biological performances. ",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO2 nanodot films have been found to be able to release cells under light illumination with excellent efficiency and safety. In the present study, we investigated the effects of rutile contents in TiO2 nanodot films on such light induced cell detachment behavior. The results showed that TiO2 nanodot films with different contents of rutile phase have been prepared successfully. The content of rutile phase increased with the increase in calcination temperature. All films possessed good cell adhesion but there was a decrease in cell proliferation with the increasing content of rutile phase. Single cell detachment assay showed that the films with high rutile contents (calcined at 900 \u00b0C and 1100 \u00b0C) showed better cell detachment performance. That was ascribed to the changes of the secondary structure of extracellular proteins adsorbed on the nanodot surface after ultraviolet (365 nm, UV365) illumination. In addition, cell sheets detached through UV365 illumination maintained high activity and could be further used in tissue engineering. The present work showed that the existence of rutile phase is helpful in cell detachment behavior and it could be utilized to optimize light-induced cell detachment behavior. Statement of Significance This work discovers that the presence of rutile phase in TiO2 nanodot films could improve the light-induced cell detachment behavior, although rutile phase is inferior to anatase phase on light induced superhydrophilicity. That strongly supported that the behaviors of adsorbed proteins are crucial in acquiring cell sheet with light illumination. In fact, the state and behavior of adsorbed protein greatly affect the interaction between biomaterials and living cells. Therefore, we consider this work is not only important in harvesting cells or cell sheets through light illumination, but also helpful in further understanding of interaction between biomaterials and cells.",

Meanwhile, surface morphology of the biomaterials could regulate cellular responses as well as strengthen the rhBMP-2 interaction with cells for better bone induction. Herein, TiO nanorod films with varied mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) incorporation amount were designed to strengthen the efficacy of rhBMP-2, basing on optimized loading/release behaviors and surface nanostructure cooperatively. The MBG incorporation improved rhBMP-2 loading amount and regulated its release behavior. Consequently, the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on the incorporated films was extremely enhanced, and the incorporated nanorod film with 200nm MBG thickness exhibited the best osteoinduction effect. However, MBG film and the incorporated nanorod film had the same loading amount of rhBMP-2, the latter showed a much higher expression of 7-day osteogenic differentiation index than the former, which could be attributed to the synergistic effect of optimized rhBMP-2 release behavior and surface morphology. The MBG incorporated TiO nanorod films here presents a promising strategy for enhancing osteoinduction through optimized rhBMP-2 release behavior.",

In this work, in vitro cultured cell sheets were treated with paraformaldehyde or ethanol and eventually become ECM. Such ECM was then immobilized on titanium substrates via polydopamine chemistry. Their effects on bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) behaviors were investigated. It was found that paraformaldehyde treated ECM coatings (PT-ECM) showed well-maintained microstructure, whereas that of ethanol treated (ET-ECM) were completely changed. As a result, different amide structures and distributions of ECM components, such as laminin and collagen I, were exhibited. Alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin secretion, related gene expression and mineral deposition were evaluated for BMSCs cultured on both ECM coatings. PT-ECM was demonstrated to promote osteogenic differentiation much more efficiently than ET-ECM. That is ascribed to the preservation of native ECM milieu of PT-ECM. Such ECM acquirement and immobilization method could establish surfaces being able to direct stem cell responses on various materials. That shows promising potential in bone tissue engineering and other related biomedical applications.",

The microstructure and BSA loading quantity of the coatings could be controlled by the electrochemical deposition parameters, such as deposition potential, BSA concentration and its adding sequence in the electrolyte. The BSA loading quantity in the coatings was obtained in the range of 0.0170-0.173mg/cm(2), enhancing the cell adhesion and proliferation of the coatings with the simultaneous release. The distinct release behaviors of BSA were attributed to their gradient distribution with different mineralization degrees, which could be adjusted by the deposition process.

In the present study, the effects of arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid (RGD) immobilization on cell growth, cell sheet construction and cell harvest through light illumination are investigated. RGD was first immobilized on TiO 2  nanodots films through simple physical adsorption, and then mouse pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on the films. It was found that RGD immobilization promoted cell adhesion and proliferation. It was also observed that cells cultured on RGD immobilized films showed relatively high level of pan-cadherin. Cells harvested with ultraviolet illumination (365\u00a0nm) showed good viability on both RGD immobilized and unmodified TiO 2  nanodot films. Single cell detachment assay showed that cells detached more quickly on RGD immobilized TiO 2  nanodot films. That could be ascribed to the RGD release after UV365 illumination. The current study demonstrated that RGD immobilization could effectively improve both the cellular responses and light-induced cell harvest.",

In this work, the exposed nanorod-heights in TiO2 nanorod films were adjusted for enhancing cellular responses. The adjustment was realized by incorporating mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) into the nanorod films via a sol\u2013gel method. The exposed nanorod-heights in the films could be changed from the original \u223c300 nm to \u223c200 nm and \u223c100 nm. The cellular responses on the nanostructured surfaces were evaluated through culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results showed that the films with shortened nanorod-heights had better cellular responses and could accelerate osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, and the films with 100 nm nanorod-height provided the best surface for cell growth. This is attributed to the nanostructure with the shortened nanorod-heights being well recognized by the cells, consequently the cells grew with a faster osteogenic differentiation through a strengthened BMP-smads signal pathway.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, hydrothermal treatment and ultraviolet illumination (254\u202fnm) were utilized to regulate the surface hydroxyls of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanodots films. The effects on light-induced cell detachment behaviors were also investigated and discussed. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Circular dichroism were used to characterize the surface morphology, crystalline phase, surface composition and adsorption conformation of protein molecules. It was found that a combined process of ultraviolet illumination followed by hydrothermal treatment not only promoted cells adhesion but also showed the highest efficiency in light induced cell detachment. The reason is ascribed to that such process promotes the formation of terminal hydroxyl groups in TiO 2  surface, and subsequently affect the adsorption conformation of protein molecules. This study indicated that such treatment could effectively modulate the contents of surface hydroxyl groups in different states. That shows much potential in optimizing the biological performance of TiO 2  based biomaterials.",

In the present study, we explored whether S100A6 plays a role in the development of endometriosis. Significantly higher levels of mRNA and protein expression of S100A6 were observed in ectopic endometrial tissues compared to eutopic and normal endometrial tissues. Silencing of S100A6 in ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) significantly inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion. Moreover, knockdown of S100A6 suppressed p38/MAPK activity in ectopic ESCs, which can be partially attenuated by CacyBP/SIP phosphorylation inhibitor. In conclusion, our results suggest that the abnormal expression of S100A6 may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis and the S100A6/CacyBP/p38 signaling may provide as a promising treatment target.",

The steroid receptor RNA activator 1 (SRA1) produces SRA long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and SRA protein (SRAP), which regulate ER expression at the RNA and protein levels in some hormone-dependent tumors via an alternative splicing event. However, only a few are reported on their expressions in endometriosis. Here, we observed that low expression levels of SRA lncRNA and ER-\u03b1 but relatively high expression levels of SRAP and ER-\u03b2 were detected in ovarian endometriotic tissues versus normal endometrial tissues. Steroid receptor RNA activator 1-small interfering RNA treatment significantly increased ER-\u03b1 levels but reduced ER-\u03b2 levels in endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs). Furthermore, the treatment can also attenuate the proliferation and promote early apoptosis in these cells. Our results indicate that the regulation of ER via SRA in ovarian endometriosis may play a significant role in the growth of ESCs.",

Although a dysregulated lncRNA expression profile has been speculated, very few studies have addressed this hypothesis. We determined the differential lncRNA and mRNA expression patterns between endometriosis and control tissues, and between eutopic and normal endometrium in the proliferative phase, using RNA sequencing. The potential targets of lncRNA were predicted on the basis of cis and trans action, and lncRNAs were functionally annotated in relation to their co-expressed mRNAs. Dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened relative to the biological features of endometriosis, and the five filtered lncRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR. A total of 9924 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified, and 86 lncRNAs and 1228 mRNAs were differentially expressed between the endometriosis and control groups. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in the biological processes and signaling pathways involved in endometriosis. A coding-noncoding gene (CNC) co-expression network was constructed using the dysregulated lncRNAs and their co-expressed mRNAs to simulate the complex intergenic interactions. This study is the first to use sequencing technology to elucidate the differentially lncRNA expression profiles of eutopic and normal endometrium in the proliferative phase of endometriosis. The dysregulated lncRNAs can potentially be novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of endometriosis.",

Vimentin staining was used to identify the purity of endometrial stromal cells. Lentivirus containing SOCS3 and GFP (green fluorescent protein) recombinant (LV-SOCS3-GFP) or only GFP gene (LV-GFP) was used to transfect two groups of ectopic endometrial stromal cells from the same patient respectively. They were divided into experimental (EG) and negative (NC) control. The transfection efficiency of lentivirus was measured by GFP fluorescence expression under microscope. And the expressions of SOCS3, STAT3 and JAK2 mRNA and protein were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot respectively. And phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 proteins (p-STAT3 and p-JAK2) were also analyzed by Western blot. Cell cycles and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry.The transfection efficiency of lentivirus was over 80% at 72 h post-transfection. Compared with NC, EG showed a higher expression of SOCS3 mRNA (P < 0.001). SOCS3 protein level of EG was higher than NC while p-STAT3 protein of EG obviously lower than NC. STAT3, JAK2 and p-JAK2 proteins showed no difference between two groups. The percentage of apoptotic cells in EG was higher remarkably than NC (22.0 \u00b1 1.3)% vs (4.4 \u00b1 1.3)%, P < 0.01. Moreover, EG cells showed a G0/G1 arrest compared with NC (87.0 \u00b1 3.7)% vs (76.0 \u00b1 3.7)%, P < 0.05.Exogenous SOCS3 induces cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation in ectopic endometrial stromal cells.",

        "abstract": "The activation of systemic and local inflammatory mechanisms, including elevated levels of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines in endometriosis progression, is becoming more evident in the recent years. Here, we report the involvement of CXC chemokine 16 (CXCL16) and its sole receptor, CXC chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), in pathophysiology of endometriosis. Expression of CXCL16, but not CXCR6, was significantly upregulated in endometriotic lesions when compared to control endometrium. Additionally, serum CXCL16 was significantly elevated in women with endometriosis when compared to control group. Moreover, blockade of the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis by CXCR6 small-interfering RNA reduced the migration and invasion of ectopic endometrial stromal cells (EESCs) followed by decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1 treatment induced the expression of CXCL16 in EESCs. In conclusion, these results suggest that CXCL16/CXCR6 axis, whose expression was enhanced by TNF-\u03b1, may be associated with the increased motility of EESCs, through regulation of ERK1/2 signaling, thus contributing to the development of endometriosis. These findings indicate that the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis may contribute to the progression of endometriosis and could be served as a potential target for diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Is phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) associated with increased motility of endometriotic cells from endometrioma? Elevated PRL-3 promotes cytoskeleton reorganization, cell migration and invasion of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from endometrioma. Overexpression of PRL-3 is associated with cancer cell migration, invasion and metastatic phenotype. Primary human ESCs were isolated from eutopic endometrium of women without endometriosis (EuCo, n = 10), with histologically proven endometrioma (EuEM, n = 19) and from the cyst wall of ovarian endometriosis (OvEM, n = 26). The expression of PRL-3 in ESCs derived from EuCo, EuEM and OvEM at different phases of menstrual cycle were compared. The protein and mRNA levels of PRL-3 were examined by western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. ESCs from OvEM were transfected with/without short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA). Additionally, a plasmid-mediated delivery system was used to achieve PRL-3 overexpression in ESCs from EuEM. The cellular distribution of F-actin and \u03b1-tubulin were examined by immunocytochemistry. Cell motility was evaluated by a transwell migration/invasion assay. The protein and mRNA levels of PRL-3 are significantly elevated in ESCs from OvEM compared with EuCo and EuEM. The expression of PRL-3 was not altered between proliferative phase and secretory phase in ESCs from all groups. Knockdown of PRL-3 significantly modified the distribution of F-actin and \u03b1-tubulin cytoskeleton, inhibited cell migration and invasion. Endogenous inhibition of PRL-3 attenuated the expression of Ras homolog gene family members A and C (RhoA, RhoC), Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, but not MMP2 in ESCs from OvEM. Additionally, overexpression of PRL-3 in ESCs from EuEM up-regulates cell migration and invasion, and increases the expression of RhoA, RhoC, ROCK1 and MMP9. Lack of in vivo animal studies is the major limitation of our report. Our results should be further confirmed in a larger cohort of patients and extended to include eutopic and ectopic endometrium from patients with peritoneal endometriosis at different stages of the disease. Our study describes that elevated expression of PRL-3 contributes to the cell motility of ESCs from endometrioma. The results emphasize the importance of metastatic-related factor PRL-3 in the pathogenesis of endometrioma.

        "abstract": "Ezrin is a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of membrane-cytoskeletal linkage proteins. It is important for maintenance of cell shape, adhesion, migration and division. The overexpression of ezrin in some tumours is associated with increased cell migration that is mediated by the Rho/ROCK family of small GTPases. To investigate the role of ezrin in the migration of ectopic endometrial cells in endometriosis, we conducted real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with endometriosis compared with those without the disease. RNAi, wound healing assays and western blot analysis of endometriotic cells were also included in this research. We found significantly higher levels of mRNA expression of ezrin (0.42 versus 0.27, P < 0.05), RhoA (0.99 versus 0.74, P < 0.05), RhoC (0.79 versus 0.43, P < 0.005) and ROCK1 (0.68 versus 0.38, P < 0.005) in the ectopic endometrial cells compared with the eutopic endometrial cells in endometriosis. Blocking ezrin with small-interfering RNA reduced the migration of ectopic endometrial cells with decreased expression of RhoA (42.68%), RhoC (58.42%) and ROCK1 (59.88%). Our results indicate that the over-expression of ezrin in endometriosis may play a significant role in the migration of endometrial cells of endometriosis, and the RhoC/Rock pathway may provide a promising treatment target.",

The method is further testified in a standard radon chamber. When specific activity of radon is 1. 816 kBq /m3 in the chamber,the RTAA is estimated to be 112. 17 min,which is in agreement with the mean-ventilation time in the chamber,104. 17 min. Therefore,the residence time of the atmospheric aerosol can be estimated by using the specific activity ratios of radionuclide in the same decay chain,such as 214Bi /214Pb,210Bi /210Pb and 210Po /210Pb.",

Characteristics of migration and accumulation of the trace elements in the combustion process were studied based on the elemental concentrations in the samples. The results showed that V was depleted in fly ash and enriched in bottom ash. Mo and Co were depleted in bottom ash and enriched in fly ash. Cr, Ni, As, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the bottom ash and fly ash were in enrichment state. As, Cu, Zn, and Pb were significantly enriched in PM2.5. The arsenic in coal was mainly As5+ with small was amount of As3+. During the combustion, As was enriched in PM2.5 and fly ash. The As5+, as a major speciation of As, was about 84%, 81%, and 87% in bottom ash, fly ash, and PM2.5, respectively.",

An electrical low pressure impactor(ELPI)was employed to determine concentrations of number and mass of 12 size classes (mean particle diameter ranged from 0.03 to 10.00 \u03bcm) of airborne particulate matters in smoking and non-smoking rooms. The concentrations of number and mass of airborne particles in smoking room were 1.76 times and 1.29 times,respectively,of those found in the non-smoking room. The mass concentration of particulates emitted from tobacco smoke in indoor air exhibited the bimodal distribution patterns showing peaks for the 0.20-0.70 \u03bcm and 5.00-8.20 \u03bcm size fractions. Particulates emitted from tobacco smoke affected primarily on the number concentrations of those with size of 0.03-1.00 \u03bcm. The particle size affected both the diffusion rates and number & mass concentrations of the particulate matters; smaller particulates diffused more quickly. The tobacco smoke particles dissipated slowly indoor. The health effect of their long staying time in the indoor environment is a matter of concern.",

By measured the radioactivity intensity in different tissues in different time point, we got the regular pattern of scavenging particles from pulmonary and the metabolism of the particles in a rat. The ultrafine particles can transport from the pulmonary to blood, then participated metabolism and expelled out of the body by feces in both hypertension rats and normal rats. The speed of unltrafine particulars transporting to blood is faster than the normal ones and expelled through feces in hypertension animals are less than those in normal rats.

Dichloromethane extraction, TLC purification, and gas chromatography-combustion system and isotope mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS), are used to measure the stable carbon isotope compositions (\u03b4 13C). The fractional contributions of coal combustion, vehicle exhaust and biomass burning to the PAHs in the fine particulate matters (PM2.5) collected in Jiading district, a suburb of Shanghai, are estimated. The results show that the \u03b4 13C values increase with decreasing molecular weight. The coal combustion and biomass burning play bigger role than vehicle exhaust in the PAHs, compared to the \u03b4 13C values of PAHs in all kinds of potential pollution sources. The estimated contributions from coal combustion, vehicle exhaust and biomass burning to PAHs of PM 25 range from 3%-21%, 29%-33% and 46%-67%, respectively, which agree well with the surrounding condition of the sampling site, indicating that it is feasible to estimate the fractional contributions of PAHs quantitatively by using stable carbon isotopic analysis.",

        "abstract": "Sulfate, nitrate and ammonium (SNA) are the dominant species in secondary inorganic aerosol, and are considered an important factor in regional haze formation. Size-fractionated aerosol particles for a whole year were collected to study the size distribution of SNA as well as their chemical species in Shanghai. SNA mainly accumulated in fine particles and the highest average ratio of SNA to particulate matter (PM) was observed to be 47% in the fine size fraction (0.49-0.95 \u03bcm). Higher sulfur oxidation ratio and nitrogen oxidation ratio values were observed in PM of fine size less than 0.95 \u03bcm. Ion balance calculations indicated that more secondary sulfate and nitrate would be generated in PM of fine size (0.49-0.95 \u03bcm). Sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of typical samples were analyzed. Results revealed that sulfur mainly existed as sulfate with a proportion (atomic basis) more than 73% in all size of PM and even higher at 90% in fine particles. Sulfate mainly existed as (NH4)2SO4 and gypsum in PM of Shanghai. Compared to non-haze days, a dramatic increase of (NH4)2SO4 content was found in fine particles on haze days only, which suggested the promoting impact of (NH4)2SO4 on haze formation. According to the result of air mass backward trajectory analysis, more (NH4)2SO4 would be generated during the periods of air mass stagnation. Based on XANES, analysis of sulfate species in size-fractionated aerosol particles can be an effective way to evaluate the impact of sulfate aerosols on regional haze formation.",

Sulfur K-edge XANES spectroscopy has been successfully used to characterize sulfur species in atmospheric particulate matter (PM). We tried to analyze the concentration of sulfur in PM using XANES combined with ion chromatography (IC). Different sulfur states and their percentage to total sulfur element in PM were conformed by analyzing the sulfur K-edge XANES spectra. The sulfur concentration under different states was obtained using the sulfur concentration in soluble SO4 2- divided by the percentage of +6 sulfur in PM. The XANES and IC analyses of atmospheric PM2.5 collected at five coastal sites in Shanghai revealed that sulfates (about 90%) was the dominating sulfur compound in the samples, while a few sulfonates (4.8%-6.5%) and di- and polysulfides (0%-6.8%) were detected. The concentration of total sulfur in the atmospheric PM2.5 is 3.60-6.38 \u03bcg \u00b7 m-3.",

By measured the radioactivity inten- sity in different tissues in different time point, we got the regular pattern of scavenging particles from pulmonary and the metabolism of the particles in a rat. The ultrafine particles can transport from the pulmonary to blood, then par- ticipated metabolism and expelled out of the body by feces in both hypertension rats and normal rats. The speed of unltrafine particulars transporting to blood is faster than the normal ones and expelled through feces in hypertension animals are less than those in normal rats. In conclusion, the ultrafine particles are more harmful to hypertension pa- tients because the particles can easily transport from lung to blood and be hardly scavenged from body through feces, so the hypertension patients may be the sensitive group by ultrafine particle in the atmosphere.",

Median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), elemental correlation coefficient as well as enrichment factor (EF) of each size fraction were calculated to characterize the sources of elements in fine/ultrafine particulate matters. Ca and Ti distributed mainly in coarse particles (> 2 microm) with size independent enrichment factors between 0.1 and 3.2, and the correlation coefficient between Ca and Ti was as high as 0.933, which implied strong contribution from nature sources, such as soil dusts and resuspended dusts. However, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cl, S mainly distributed in 0.1-1.0 microm particulate matters with MMAD between 0.56-0.94 microm. The EF of V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb increased with decreasing particle size. The highest EF were found for Pb in ultrafine particulate matters (< 0.1 microm) with EF of 2,023.7-2,244.2. The evidences suggested that these elements were significantly influenced by anthropogenic sources and enriched in fine/ultrafine particles smaller than 1 microm. Fe distributed uniformly in the particles larger than 0.2 microm with MMAD of 1.3 microm. The results indicated non-negligible influences of remote transmission of anthropogenic pollutions.",

By means of least square analysis of the XANES spectra, the major organic and inorganic sulfur forms were quantitatively determined. The results show that about 70% of the sulfur in raw coal is present as organic and a minor fraction of the sulfur occurs as other forms: 17% of pyrite and 13% of sulfate. While in bottom ash, fly ash, and PM2.5, the dominant form of sulfur is sulfate, with the percentage of 80,79 and 94, respectively. Moreover, a number of other reduced sulfur including thiophenic sulfur, element sulfur and pyrrhotite are also present. During coal combustion, most of organic sulfur and pyrite were oxidized and released into the atmosphere as SO2 gas, part of them was converted to sulfate existing in coal combustion by-products, and a small part of pyrite was probably reduced to elemental sulfur and pyrrhotite. The results may provide information for assessing the pollution caused by small boiler and developing new methods for the control of SO2 pollution. \u00a9 2009 Chinese Physical Society.",

For estimating size distribution of SOC in these atmospheric particles, a method of determining (OC/EC)(pri) in atmospheric particles with different sizes was discussed and developed, with which SOC was estimated. According to the correlation between OC and EC, main sources of the particles were also estimated roughly. The size distributions of OC and SOC showed a bi-modal with peaks in the particles with size of < 0.49 microm and > 3.0 microm, respectively. EC showed both of a bi-modal and tri-modal. Compared with OC, EC was preferably enriched in particles with size of < 0.49 microm. Mass concentrations of OC and EC in fine particles (< 3.00 microm) accounted for 59.8%-80.0% and 58.1%-82.4% of those in total suspended particles. OC and EC were preferably enriched in fine particles (< 3.00 microm). The concentrations of SOC in the particles with different sizes accounted for 15.7%-79.1% of OC in the particles with corresponding size. Concentrations of SOC in fine aerosols (< 3.00 microm) and coarse aerosols (> 3.00 microm) accounted for 41.4% and 43.5% of corresponding OC. Size distributions of OC, EC and SOC showed time-dependence. The correlation between OC and EC showed that the main contribution to atmospheric particles in Jiading District derived from light petrol vehicles exhaust.",

        "abstract": "Background: Dust storm originated from the northwest region of China brought dust particles for Shanghai every spring, which resulted in serious particulate pollution. However, the studies of the impact of dust storm on the Shanghai atmospheric aerosols were limited to the concentrations of ions and elements. It is considered that the chemical species of atmospheric aerosols were much more necessary for the evaluation of the impact of dust storm on the particulate pollution in Shanghai. Purpose: Based on the elements concentration variations, backward trajectories of air masses and chlorine, calcium, sulfur species in aerosols during the dust event, the impact of dust storm on the chemical species of aerosols in Shanghai was studied. Methods: Elements concentrations of the samples were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence(XRF) based on synchrotron radiation. To identify the potential importance of different source regions on aerosol composition during dust events, the air mass trajectories were calculated by using the model HYSPLIT version 4 developed by NOAA/ARL. Chemical species of S, Cl, Ca were analyzed by synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption near edge structure(XANES). Sulfur K-edge XANES is capable of distinguishing various sulfate species in a non-destructive way and we used linear combination fitting procedure to quantify the concentrations of sulfate species in PM. Results: Elements concentration variations during the dust storm period showed that crust elements(Si, Al, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Ti) in particles increased substantially during dust storm.However, pollution elements(S, Zn, Pb, Cu, V, Cr, As) from local region decreased by the clean effect of dust storm.Combined XANES of S, Cl, Ca in particulate samples with backward trajectories, the possible sources and reasons of their chemical species were studied. During dust storm, sulfur mainly existed as CaSO4\u00b72H2O, Cl existed as organic chloride and Cl, Ca existed as CaCO3. In the samples of other days, sulfur was mainly existed as(NH4)2SO4, Cl existed as organic chloride and Ca existed as Gypsum. The source of Cl was sea salts which brought by dust storm along the way. Gypsum(CaSO4\u00b72H2O) was formed in the reactions of CaCO3and SO42 during the transportation.Conclusion: It is shown that synchrotron radiation XANES is a powerful tool to identify chlorine, calcium and especially sulfur species in aerosol samples. Dust storm not only transported amount of crust particles but also brought particles along the way to atmosphere environment in Shanghai. During the transportation, dust particles could chemically react with the pollution particles of the local region.",

The PIXE results show that the sulfur concentrations in the leaves collected at the polluted site are significantly higher than those in controls. The Sulfur XANES spectra show the presence of organic (disulfides, thiols, thioethers, sulfonates and sulfoxides) and inorganic sulfur (sulfates) in the leaves. The inorganic sulfur in the leaves of camphor tree polluted by coal combustion is 15% more than that of the control site. The results suggest that the long-term coal-burning pollution resulted in an enhanced content of the total sulfur and sulfate in the leaves, and the uptake of sulfur by leaves had exceeded the metabolic requirement of plants and the excess of sulfur was stored as SO 2- 4. It can monitor the sulfur pollution in atmosphere. \u00a9 2009 Chinese Physical Society.",

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, photoluminescence, and cathodoluminescence spectra as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the samples. The pH, temperature, concentration, solvent, and reaction time have a crucial influence on the phase formation, shape evolution, and microstructure. The reaction mechanism is considered as a dissolution/precipitation process; it is proposed that the self-assembly evolution occurs by homocentric layer-by-layer growth. Under UV excitation and low-voltage electron beam excitation, calcite-type LuBO(3):Eu(3+) particles show a strong orange emission corresponding to the (5)D(0)-->(7)F(1) transition of Eu(3+) whereas vaterite-type LuBO(3):Eu(3+) particles exhibit a strong red emission with much higher R/O values (that is, chromatically redder fluorescence than that of crystals grown from a direct solid-state reaction). The tunable luminescent properties have potential applications in fluorescent lamps and field emission displays.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra as well as lifetimes were employed to characterize the resulting composite particles. The results of XRD, FE-SEM, and TEM indicate that the 800 degrees C annealed sample consists of crystalline YBO3 shells and amorphous SiO2 cores, in spherical shape with a narrow size distribution. Under UV (240 nm) and VUV (172 nm) light or electron beam (1-6 kV) excitation, these particles show the characteristic 5D0-7F1-4 orange-red emission lines of Eu3+ with a quantum yield ranging from 36% (one-layer Y0.9Eu0.1BO3 on SiO2) to 54% (four-layer Y0.9Eu0.1BO3 on SiO2). The luminescence properties (emission intensity and color coordinates) of Eu3+ ions in the core-shell particles can be tuned by the coating number of Y0.9Eu0.1BO3 layers and SiO2 core particle size to some extent, pointing out the great potential for these particles applied in displaying and lightening fields.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising antitumor treatment that is based on the photosensitizers that inhibit cancer cells by yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS) after irradiation of light with specific wavelengths. As a potential photosensitizer, titanium dioxide (TiO2) exhibits minimal dark cytotoxicity and excellent ultraviolet (UV) light triggered cytotoxicity, but is challenged by the limited tissue penetration of UV light. Herein, a novel near-infrared (NIR) light activated photosensitizer for PDT based on TiO2-coated upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) core/shell nanocomposites (UCNPs@TiO2 NCs) is designed. NaYF4:Yb(3+),Tm(3+)@NaGdF4:Yb(3+) core/shell UCNPs can efficiently convert NIR light to UV emission that matches well with the absorption of TiO2 shells. The UCNPs@TiO2 NCs endocytosed by cancer cells are able to generate intracellular ROS under NIR irradiation, decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential to release cytochrome c into the cytosol and then activating caspase 3 to induce cancer cell apoptosis. NIR light triggered PDT of tumor-bearing mice with UCNPs@TiO2 as photosensitizers can suppress tumor growth efficiently due to the better tissue penetration than UV irradiation. On the basis of the evidence of in vitro and in vivo results, UCNPs@TiO2 NCs could serve as an effective photosensitizer for NIR light mediated PDT in antitumor therapy.",

A series of controlled experiments indicate that the shape and size of as-prepared architectures can be tuned effectively by controlling the reaction conditions, such as reaction time, vanadium sources, different organic additives, and the molar ratio of organic additive trisodium citrate (Cit(3-)):Y(3+). It is found that Cit(3-) as a ligand and shape modifier has the dynamic effect by adjusting the growth rate of different facets under different experimental conditions, resulting in the formation of various geometries of the final products. The possible formation mechanisms for products with diverse architectures have been presented in detail. Additionally, we systematically investigate the luminescent properties of the YVO(4):Ln(3+) (Ln = Eu, Dy, Sm, and Er). Because of an efficient energy transfer from vanadate groups to dopants, YVO(4):Ln(3+) (Ln = Eu, Dy, Sm, and Er) phosphors showed their strong characteristic emission under ultraviolet excitation and low-voltage electron beam excitation. The ability to generate YVO(4) nano/microstructures with diverse shapes, multicolor emission, and higher quantum efficiency provides a great opportunity for systematically evaluating their luminescence properties, as well as fully exploring their applications in many types of color display fields.",

        "abstract": "Monodisperse poly(acrylic acid)-modified Fe(3)O(4) (PAA@Fe(3)O(4)) hybrid microspheres with dual responses (magnetic field and pH) were successfully fabricated. The PAA polymer was encapsulated into the inner cavity of Fe(3)O(4) hollow spheres by a vacuum-casting route and photo-initiated polymerization. TEM images show that the samples consist of monodisperse porous spheres with a diameter around 200 nm. The Fe(3)O(4) spheres, after modification with the PAA polymer, still possess enough space to hold guest molecules. We selected doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug to investigate the drug loading and release behavior of as-prepared composites. The release of DOX molecules was strongly dependent on the pH value due to the unique property of PAA. The HeLa cell-uptake process of DOX-loaded PAA@Fe(3)O(4) was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). After being incubated with HeLa cells under magnet magnetically guided conditions, the cytotoxtic effects of DOX-loaded PAA@Fe(3)O(4) increased. These results indicate that pH-responsive magnetic PAA@Fe(3)O(4) spheres have the potential to be used as anticancer drug carriers.",

X-Ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) and lifetimes, as well as cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were used to characterize the samples. Under low-voltage electron beam excitation, the Tb 3+-doped samples show a green luminescence, with a better CIE coordinates and higher emission intensity than the commercial product ZnO: Zn. Blue and yellow emissions could be obtained by doping with Tm3+ and Dy3+, respectively. A color-tunable emission in SrY2O 4 phosphors can be realized by co-doping with Tm3+ and Dy3+. White cathodoluminescence (CL) has been realized in a single-phase SrY2O4 host by co-doping with Tm3+ and Dy3+ for the first time with CIE (0.315, 0.333). Furthermore, the cathodoluminescence (CL) properties of SrY2O4: Tb 3+/Tm3+/Dy3+ phosphors including the dependence of CL intensity on accelerating voltage and filament current, the decay behaviour of CL intensity under electron bombardment, and the stability of CIE chromaticity coordinate have been investigated in detail. The as-prepared phosphors might be promising for use in field-emission display (FED) devices. \u00a9 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), N2 adsorption/desorption results show that these composites conser ved regular sphere morphology and ordered mesoporous structure after the formation of FexOy nanoparticles. XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed that the FexOy generated in these mesoporous silica hosts is mainly composed of \u03b3-Fe2O 3. Magnetic measurements re veal that these composites with different \u03b3-Fe2O3 loading amounts possess super-paramagnetic properties at 300 K, and the saturation magnetization increases with increasing Fe ratio loaded. The ibuprofen-containing spheres were then coated with biodegradable poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) by the S/O/W single-emulsion method. The PLGA hybrid magnetic spheres realize a reduced initial burst with a sustained release stage lasting for 20 days. These composites with or without the PLGA can be used as potential vectors for drug targeting and controlled-release systems. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

Calcination of the In(OH)3 crystals with different morphologies (nanorod bundles and spheres) at 600 degrees C in air yielded In2O3 crystals with the same morphology. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the samples. The pH values of microemulsion play an important role in the morphological control of the as-formed In(OH)3 nano-microstructures from the hydrothermal process. The formation mechanisms for the In(OH)3 nano-microstructures have been proposed on an aggregation mechanism. In2O3 nanorod bundles and spheres show a similar blue emission peaking around 416 and 439 nm under the 383-nm UV excitation, which is mainly attributed to the oxygen vacancies in the In2O3 nano-microstructures.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption/desorption, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were used to characterize the samples. The results indicate that the nanocomposite with general 50 nm shell thickness and 300 nm core size shows typical ordered mesoporous characteristics (2.3 nm) and has spherical morphology with smooth surface and narrow size distribution. The bifunctional system shows unique green up-conversion emission under 980 nm NIR laser excitation even after loading with drug molecules. In addition, biocompatibility tests on L929 fibroblast cells using an MTT assay reveals low cytotoxicity of the system. Drug release tests suggest that the nanocomposite has a controlled drug release property with ibuprofen (IBU) as the model drug. Interestingly, the up-conversion emission intensity of the bifunctional carrier increases with the released amount of model drug, thus allowing the release process to be monitored and tracked by the change of up-conversion luminescence intensity. This composite can potentially act as a functional drug carrier system.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as photoluminescence (PL) spectra are used to characterize the resulting samples. The size, shape, and composition of the products could be tuned just by varying the organic additives and the pH values of the initial reaction solutions. The morphologies for the products include nanospheres, submicrospheres, peanut-like particles, as well as the spindle-like and star-like aggregates. Moreover, the size of the samples can be tuned from 50 nm to 150 nm. Additionally, we systematically investigate the luminescence properties of different lanthanide ions in BaGdF(5) host. Under single-wavelength excitation at 260 nm, the samples doped with different lanthanide ions show intensive multicolor visible emissions depending on the doped Ln(3+) ions. The luminescence process can be attributed to the strong absorption of UV irradiation by Ce(3+) ions, followed by energy transfer to Gd(3+) ions, from which the energy is transferred to Ln(3+), resulting in the emission from the luminescent Ln(3+) centers. The Gd(3+) ions play an intermediate role in this process.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a facile one-step route to controlled synthesis of colloidal KMgF3 nanocrystals via the thermolysis of metal trifluoroacetate precursors in combined solvents (OA/OM) using microwave irradiation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were employed to characterize the samples. Only through the variation of the OA/OM ratio, can the phase and shape of nanocrystals be readily controlled, resulting in the formation of well-defined near-spherical nanoparticles, and nanoplates of cubic-phased KMgF3, as well as nanorods of tetragonal-phased MgF 2, and a possible mechanism has been proposed to elucidate this effect. Furthermore, all these samples in this system can be well dispersed in nonpolar solvents such as cyclohexane to form stable and clear colloidal solutions, due to the successful coating of organic surfactants (OA/OM) on the nanocrystal surface. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating Tb3+ ions into the KMgF3 host via this method, which shows strong green emission corresponding to the characteristic 5D4-7FJ (J = 3, 4, 5, 6) emission of Tb3+ ions, which can be potentially used as labels for biological molecules. \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

The sizes and morphologies of the YOF products could be easily modulated by changing the pH values and fluoride sources. XRD, TG-DTA, FT-IR, SEM, and TEM, as well as photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra, were used to characterize the prepared samples. The YOF:Ln3+ nanospheres show the characteristic f-f transitions of Ln3+ (Ln = Tb, Eu, Tm, Dy, Ho, Sm) ions and give bright green, red, blue, yellow, blue-green, and yellow-orange emission, respectively, under UV light and low-voltage electron beam excitation. Furthermore, YOF:0.03Tb3+ phosphors exhibit green luminescence with superior properties in comparison with the commercial phosphor ZnO:Zn to a degree, which is advantageous for improving display quality. Because of the simultaneous luminescence of Ln3+ in the YOF host, the luminescence colors of YOF:Ln3+ phosphors can be precisely adjusted by changing the doped Ln3+ ions and corresponding concentrations, which makes these materials hold great promise for applications in field-emission displays. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.",

In the synthetic process, oleic acid as a surfactant played a crucial role in confining the growth and solubility of the MF(2) NCs. The as-prepared CaF(2), SrF(2) and BaF(2) NCs present morphologies of truncated octahedron, cube and sheet in a narrow distribution, respectively. Possible growth mechanisms were proposed to explain these results. The as-prepared NCs are highly crystalline and can be well dispersed in cyclohexane to form stable and clear colloidal solutions, which demonstrate strong emission bands centred at 400 nm in photoluminescence (PL) spectra compared with the cyclohexane solvent. The PL properties of the colloidal solutions of the as-prepared NCs can be ascribed to the trap states of surface defects.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticles have been explored as nonviral gene carriers for years because of the simplicity of surface modification and lack of immune response. Lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are becoming attractive candidates for biomedical applications in virtue of their unique optical properties and multimodality imaging ability. Here, we report a UCNPs-based structure with polyethylenimine coating for both efficient gene transfection and trimodality imaging. Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that the nanoparticles exhibited significantly decreased cytotoxicity compared to polyethylenimine polymer. Further, in vitro studies revealed that the gene carriers are able to transfer the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) plasmid DNA into Hela cells in higher transfection efficiency than PEI. Gene silencing was also examined by delivering bcl-2 siRNA into Hela cells, resulting in significant downregulation of target bcl-2 mRNA. More importantly, we demonstrated the feasibility of upconversion gene carriers to serve as effective contrast agents for MRI/CT/UCL trimodality imaging both in vitro and in vivo. The facile fabrication process, great biocompatibility, enhanced gene transfection efficiency, and great bioimaging ability can make it promising for application in gene therapy.",

The phases and shapes of the products can be tuned by changing the experimental parameters, including F(-) source and pH value of mother liquor. The morphologies for the products range from submicrorods, submicrospheres, dumbbell-like nanorods, cobblestone-like particles to aggregates constructed from nanoparticles. The results indicate that F(-) source and pH value play a critical role in determining the morphologies of the final products. Additionally, we investigate the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Ce(3+)/Ln(3+) (LnEu, Tb and Dy) codoped down-conversion (DC) and Yb(3+)/Er(3+) (Tm(3+), Ho(3+)) codoped up-conversion (UC) in \u03b2-NaGdF(4) host lattices. In the process of DC photoluminescence, energy transfer has occurred. This energy transfer occurs through the energy migration process like S\u2192Gd(3+)\u2192(Gd(3+))(n)\u2192A (S represents the sensitizer and A represents the activator) and the Gd(3+) plays an intermediate role in the process.",

In particular, the cathodoluminescence (CL) color of LaOCl:Tb(3+) can be tuned from blue to green by changing Tb(3+)-doped concentration, and their CL intensities (brightness) are higher than those of commercial products Y(2)SiO(5):Ce(3+) and ZnO:Zn, respectively. White CL can be realized by codoping with Tb(3+) and Sm(3+) in a single-phase LaOCl host. The obtained white light is very close to the standard white light.

Under UV excitation, there exist dual energy transfers (ET), i.e., Ce(3+)\u2192Mn(2+) and Ce(3+)\u2192Tb(3+) in the CYS: Ce(3+), Mn(2+), Tb(3+) system and their emitting colors can be adjusted from blue to orange-red via ET of Ce(3+)\u2192Mn(2+) and from blue to green via ET of Ce(3+)\u2192Tb(3+), respectively. Moreover, a wide-range-tunable white light emission with high quantum yields (13%-30%) were obtained by precisely controlling the contents of Ce(3+), Mn(2+) and Tb(3+) ions. On the other hand, the CL properties of CYS: Ce(3+), Mn(2+), Tb(3+) phosphors have been investigated in detail. The studied results indicate that the as-prepared CYS: Ce(3+), Mn(2+), Tb(3+) phosphors have good CL intensity and CIE color coordinate stability with a color-tunable emission crossing the whole white light region under low-voltage electron beam excitation. In general, the white light with varied hues has been obtained in Ce(3+), Mn(2+), and Tb(3+)-triactivated CYS phosphors by utilizing the principle of energy transfer and properly designed activator contents under UV (284, 358 nm) and low-voltage (1-5 kV) electron beam excitation, which make them as a potential single-composition trichromatic white-emitting phosphor.",

The theranostics fuses diagnostic and therapeutic functions, empowering early diagnosis, targeted drug delivery, and real-time monitoring of treatment effect into one step. One particularly attractive class of nanomaterials for theranostic application is lanthanide-doped hollow nanomaterials (LDHNs). Because of the existence of lanthanide ions, LDHNs show outstanding fluorescent and paramagnetic properties, enabling them to be used as multimodal bioimaging agents. Synchronously, the huge interior cavities of LDHNs are able to be applied as efficacious tools for storage and delivery of therapeutic agents. The LDHNs can be divided into two types based on difference of component: single-phase lanthanide-doped hollow nanomaterials and lanthanide-doped hollow nanocomposites. We describe the synthesis of first kind of nanomaterials by use of hard template, soft template, template-free, and self-sacrificing template method. For lanthanide-doped hollow nanocomposites, we divide the preparation strategies into three kinds (one-step, two-step, and multistep method) according to the synthetic procedures. Furthermore, we also illustrate the potential bioapplications of these LDHNs, including biodetection, imaging (fluorescent imaging and magnetic resonance imaging), drug/gene delivery, and other therapeutic applications.",

X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, low voltage cathodoluminescence spectra, and photoluminescence lifetimes were used to characterize the as-obtained samples. The X-ray diffraction results indicate that the samples are well crystallized with the scheelite structure of CaWO4. The transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy images illustrate that the powders consist of spherical particles with sizes from 120 to 160 nm, which are the aggregates of even smaller nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Under UV light or electron beam excitation, the CaWO4 powder exhibited a blue emission band with a maximum at 430 nm originating from the WO4/2- groups, while the CaWO4:Eu3+ powder showed red emission dominated by 613 nm ascribed to the 5D0 --> 7F2 of Eu3+, and the CaWO4:Tb3+ powders showed emission at 544 nm, ascribed to the 5D4 --> 7F5 transition of Tb3+. The PL excitation and emission spectra suggest that the energy is transferred from WO4/2- to Eu3+ CaWO4:Eu3+ and to Tb3+ in CaWO4:Tb3+. Moreover, the energy transfer from WO4/2- to Tb3+ in CaWO4:Tb3+ is more efficient than that from WO4/2- to EU3+ in CaWO4:Eu3+. This novel and efficient pathway could open new opportunities for further investigating the novel properties of tungstate materials.",

A series of controlled experiments indicate that the pH values in the initial reaction systems, carbon sources, and simple ions (NH(4)(+) and Na(+)) were responsible for the shape determination of the LaCO(3)OH products. A possible formation mechanism for these products with diverse architectures has been presented. After annealing at suitable temperatures, LaCO(3)OH was easily converted to La(2)O(2)CO(3) and La(2)O(3) with the initial morphologies. A systematic study on the photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence properties of Eu(3+)- or Tb(3+)-doped La(2)O(2)CO(3)/La(2)O(3) samples has been performed in detail. The excitation and site-selective emission spectra were recorded to investigate the microstructure, site symmetry, and difference in the (5)D(0) \u2192 (7)F(2) transition of Eu(3+) ions in La(2)O(2)CO(3) and La(2)O(3) host lattices. In addition, the dependence of the luminescent intensity on the morphology for the as-prepared La(2)O(2)CO(3)/La(2)O(3):Ln(3+) (Ln = Eu, Tb) samples has been investigated. The ability of generating diverse morphologies and multiemitting colors for different rare-earth activator ion (Ln = Eu, Tb) doped La(2)O(2)CO(3)/La(2)O(3) nano/microstructures provides a great opportunity for the systematic evaluation of morphology-dependent luminescence properties, as well as the full exploration of their application in many types of color display fields.",

        "abstract": "Rattle-type hollow nanocapsules are among of the most promising candidates as drug carriers owing to their huge inner space and multifunctional material combination. In this paper, rattle-type hollow CaWO(4):Tb(3+)@SiO(2) nanocapsules with a diameter of 100-110 nm and a wall thickness around 10 nm were fabricated. The hollow silica nanospheres were used as nano-reactors and the luminescent core of CaWO(4):Tb(3+) was post-filled into the nano-reactors by a vacuum nano-casting route combined with a Pechini-type sol-gel method. Subsequently, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), a model of an anti-cancer drug, is loaded into the CaWO(4):Tb(3+)@SiO(2) nanocapsules and their cell cytotoxicity, cancer cell uptake and drug release behavior are investigated in vitro. The prepared multifunctional inorganic nanocapsules show a loading capacity for DOX as high as 124 mg g(-1) and sustained-release properties. The release profile of the drug from DOX-loaded nanocapsules can last over five days. Besides, the blank CaWO(4):Tb(3+)@SiO(2) shows very low cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines (HeLa cell) while the DOX-loaded nanocapsules exhibit relatively high efficiency for killing of HeLa cells. The rapid cancer cell uptake process is observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results indicate that a rattle-type hollow CaWO(4):Tb(3+)@SiO(2) nanocapsule has the potential to be used as drug carrier in therapy. Moreover, it is possible to extend the synthetic strategy in this study to other rattle-type multifunctional composites to meet various demands.",

Photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were utilized to characterize the luminescence properties of the LaCO(3)F : Eu(3+) and LaOF : Eu(3+) samples. Under ultraviolet light excitation, the LaCO(3)F : Eu(3+) precursor shows an orange emission of Eu(3+) (dominated by (5)D(0)\u2192(7)F(1)), while the product of heat treatment, LaOF : Eu(3+), shows the characteristic emissions of Eu(3+) ((5)D(J)\u2192(7)F(J')J, J' = 0, 1, 2, 3 transitions). Under the excitation of UV and low-voltage electron beams, the emission color (including white) of LaOF : Eu(3+) can be tuned by adjusting the doping concentration of Eu(3+).

        "abstract": "In this study, we report an anticancer drug delivery system based on doxorubicin (DOX)-conjugated NaYF(4):Yb(3+)/Tm(3+) nanoparticles. The as-synthesized nanoparticles consist of uniform spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 25 nm. The drug delivery system demonstrates the ability to release DOX by cleavage of the hydrazone bond in mildly acidic environments. The spectra overlap between emission of donor NaYF(4):Yb(3+)/Tm(3+) nanoparticles at 452 nm ((1)D(2)\u2192(3)F(4)) and 477 nm ((1)G(4)\u2192(3)H(6)) and the broad absorbance of acceptor DOX centered at around 480 nm enables energy transfer to occur between the nanoparticles and DOX. The quenching and recovery of the up-conversion luminescence of NaYF(4):Yb(3+)/Tm(3+) by DOX due to luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) mechanism are applied as optical probe to confirm the DOX conjunction and monitor the release of DOX. The DOX-conjugated NaYF(4):Yb(3+)/Tm(3+) nanoparticles exhibit an obvious cytotoxic effect on SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells via MTT assay. Meanwhile, the endocytosis process of DOX-conjugated NaYF(4):Yb(3+)/Tm(3+) nanoparticles by SKVO3 cells was demonstrated through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), flow cytometry and ICP-OES. Such drug delivery system, which combines pH-triggered drug-release and up-converting nanoparticles-based LRET property, has excellent potential applications in cancer therapy and smart imaging.",

        "abstract": "A facile method for transferring hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) from chloroform to aqueous solution via encapsulation of FITC-modified gelatin based on the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction is described in this report. Due to the existence of large amount of active groups such as amine groups in gelatin, the fluorescent labeling molecules of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and platinum (IV) prodrug functionalized with carboxylic groups can be conveniently conjugated on the IONPs. The nanoparticles carrying Pt(IV) prodrug exhibit good anticancer activities when the Pt(IV) complexes are reduced to Pt(II) in the intracellular environment, while the pure Pt(IV) prodrug only presents lower cytotoxicity on cancer cells. Meanwhile, fluorescence of FITC on the surface of nanoparticles was completely quenched due to the possible F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) mechanism and showed a fluorescence recovery after gelatin release and detachment from IONPs. Therefore FITC as a fluorescence probe can be used for identification, tracking and monitoring the drug release. In addition, adding pancreatic enzyme can effectively promote the gelatin release from IONPs owing to the degradation of gelatin. Noticeable darkening in magnetic resonance image (MRI) was observed at the tumor site after in situ injection of nanoparticles, indicating the IONPs-enhanced T2-weighted imaging. Our results suggest that the gelatin encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles have potential applications in multi-functional drug delivery system for disease therapy, MR imaging and fluorescence sensor.",

The starting amount of NaF is crucial for phase purity, and the reaction time had an effect on the morphology of the products. Products with rectangles, rods, and their mixtures could be obtained at different reaction times. Under UV excitation, energy transfer from Ce(3+) to lanthanide ions Tb(3+) and Yb(3+) could be observed in both NaCeF4:Tb(3+) and NaCeF4:Yb(3+). Energy transfer from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) was proposed to be of a resonant type (ET) by luminescent dynamic studies with a theoretically calculated efficiency of up to 93%. Energy transfer from Ce(3+) to Yb(3+) was demonstrated to be a cooperative (CET) process, and the CET efficiency and total theoretical quantum efficiency were found to be 79% and 158%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Multifunctional nanocomposites integrating mesoporous and luminescence properties into a single entity are synthesized via a facile and effective approach. Oleic acid capped \u03b2-NaYF4:Ce3+/Tb 3+ nanoparticles (NPs) are transferred into aqueous solution by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactants, and further encapsulated with uniform mesoporous silica shell followed by the surface modification with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), leading to the formation of water-dispersible and biocompatible core-shell structured \u03b2-NaYF4:Ce 3+/Tb3+@mSiO2-PEG (denoted as NPs@mSiO 2-PEG) nanospheres. The as-synthesized nanospheres show a typical mesoporous structure and a green emission under UV irradiation. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), a widely used anti-cancer drug, is used as a model drug to evaluate the loading and controlled release behaviors of the NPs@mSiO 2-PEG in phosphoric acidic buffer solutions (PBS) at different pH values (pH = 7.4 and 5.0). The composite carriers provide a pH-sensitive drug release pattern and the drug releases faster under lower pH value. The endocytosis process of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled nanospheres is characterized using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) against A549 cells. The in vitro cytotoxic effect against A549 cells of the DOX-loaded carriers is investigated in detail. In addition, the extent of drug release can be monitored by the variation of photoluminescence (PL) intensity of \u03b2-NaYF4:Ce3+/Tb3+. Considering the good biocompatibility and pH-dependent drug release pattern, such core-shell structured luminescent NPs@mSiO2-PEG nanospheres have potential applications in controlled drug delivery.

Both XRD and FT-IR results indicate that GdPO4 layers have been successfully coated on the SiO2 particles, which can be further verified by the images of FESEM and TEM. Under UV light excitation, the SiO2 @ GdPO4 : Eu3+ phosphors show orange-red luminescence with Eu3+ 5D0-7F1 (593 nm) as the most prominent group. The PL excitation and emission spectra suggest that an energy transfer occurs from Gd3+ to Eu3+ in SiO2 @ GdPO4 : Eu3+ phosphors.

        "abstract": "beta-NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Yb/Er, and Yb/Tm) hexagonal microprisms with remarkably uniform morphology and size have been synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectra as well as kinetic decays were used to characterize the samples. It is found that sodium citrate as a shape modifier introduced into the reaction system plays a critical role in the shape evolution of the final products. Furthermore, the shape and size of the products can be further manipulated by adjusting the molar ratio of citrate/RE3+ (RE represents the total amount of Y3+ and the doped rare earth elements such as Eu3+, Tb3+, Yb3+/Er3+, or Yb3+/Tm3+). Under the excitation of 397 nm ultraviolet light, NaYF4:xEu3+ (x = 1.5, 5%) shows the emission lines of Eu3+ corresponding to 5D0-3 --> 7FJ (J = 0-4) transitions from 400 to 700 nm (whole visible spectral region) with different intensity, resulting in yellow and red down-conversion (DC) light emissions, respectively. When doped with 5% Tb3+ ions, the strong DC fluorescence corresponding to 5D4 --> 7FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions with 5D4 --> 7F5 (green emission at 544 nm) being the most prominent group that has been observed. In addition, under 980 nm laser excitation, the Yb3+/Er3+- and Yb3+/Tm3+-codoped beta-NaYF4 samples exhibit bright green and whitish blue up-conversion (UC) luminescence, respectively. The luminescence mechanisms for the doped lanthanide ions were thoroughly analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Combining the multi-modal medical imaging with cancer therapy in one single system has attracted the great interests for theranostic purpose. In this paper, CaF2:Yb(3+)/Er(3+)/Mn(2+)-poly(2-Aminoethyl methacrylate) (UCHNs-PAMA) hybrid microspheres were successfully fabricated. The synthetic route to the nanocomposite based on a facile hydrothermal method for fabrication of hollow upconversion (UC) nanospheres at first and then post-\ufb01lling the PAMA interiorly through photo-initiated polymerization. The UCHNs showed orange \ufb02uorescence under 980\u00a0nm near infrared (NIR) laser excitation, which provided the upconverting luminescence (UCL) imaging modality. Meanwhile, the presence of functional Mn(2+) and Yb(3+) offered the enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, respectively. Thanks to introducing amine groups-containing PAMA inside the hollow nanospheres, the Pt(IV) pro-drug, c,c,t-Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OOCCH2CH2COOH)2 (DSP), can be conveniently bonded on the polymer network to construct a nanoscale anti-cancer drug carrier. The UCHNs-PAMA-Pt(IV) nanocomposite shows effective inhibition for Hela cell line via MTT assay. In contrast, Pt(IV) pro-drug and UCHNs-PAMA microspheres behave little cytotoxicity to Hela cells. This should be attributed the fact that the anti-cancer ability can be recovered only when Pt(IV) pro-drug was reduced to Pt(II)-drug in cellular environment. Furthermore, the in\u00a0vivo experiments on small mice also confirm that the hybrid microspheres have relatively low toxic side effects and high tumor inhibition rate. These findings show that the multifunctional hybrid microspheres have potential to be used as UCL/MR/CT tri-modal imaging contrast agent and anti-cancer drug carriers.",

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and structure refinement, diffuse reflection, photoluminescence (PL), and fluorescent decay curves were used to characterize the as-prepared samples. Under UV radiation, the CNO host present a broad emission band from about 355 to 605 nm centered around 460 nm originating from the NbO6 octahedral groups, which has spectral overlaps with the excitation of f-f transitions of Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+)/Sm(3+) in CNO:Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+)/Sm(3+) samples. They show both host emission and respective emission lines derived from the characteristic f-f transitions of activators, which present different emission colors owing to the energy transfer from the NbO6 group in the host to Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+)/Sm(3+) with increasing activator concentrations. The decreases of decay lifetimes of host emissions in CNO:Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+)/Sm(3+) demonstrate the energy transfer from the hosts to Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+)/Sm(3+). The energy transfer mechanisms in CNO:Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+) phosphors have been determined to be a resonant type via dipole-dipole mechanisms. For CNO:Sm(3+), the metal-metal charge transfer transition (MMCT) might contribute to the different variations of decay lifetimes and emission intensity from CNO:Eu(3+)/Tb(3+)/Dy(3+) samples. The best quantum efficiency is 71.2% for CNO:0.01/0.02Dy(3+). The PL properties of as-prepared materials indicate the promising application in UV-pumped white-emitting lighting diodes field.",

The result of XRD indicates that the CeO(2) nanocrystals are well crystallized with a cubic structure. The TEM images illustrate that the average size of CeO(2) nanocrystals is about 3.5 nm in diameter. The absorption spectrum of CeO(2):Eu(3+) nanocrystals exhibits red-shifting with respect to that of the undoped CeO(2) nanocrystals. Under the excitation of 440 nm (or 426 nm) light, the colloidal solution of the undoped CeO(2) nanocrystals shows a very weak emission band with a maximum at 501 nm, which is remarkably enhanced by doping additional lanthanide ions (Eu(3+), Tb(3+), Sm(3+)) in the CeO(2) nanocrystals. The emission band is not due to the characteristic emission of the lanthanide ions but might arise from the oxygen vacancy which is introduced in the fluorite lattice of the CeO(2)nanocrystals to compensate the effective negative charge associated with the trivalent ions.",

        "abstract": "One-dimensional Lu(2)O(3):Eu(3+) nanofibers have been prepared by a combination method of sol-gel process and electrospinning technology. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were used to characterize the samples. The XRD, FT-IR and TG-DTA results show that Lu(2)O(3):Eu(3+) samples crystallize at 900 degrees C. SEM images indicate that as prepared precursor samples and those annealed at 900 degrees C present uniform fiberlike morphology. After being heated at 900 degrees C, the diameters of fibers decrease greatly, ranging from 90 to 180nm. TEM image further manifests that the as-formed Lu(2)O(3):Eu(3+) nanofibers consist of nanoparticles (the crystallite size is about 16.5nm). Under the short wavelength ultraviolet irradiation and the low-voltage electron beam excitation, Lu(2)O(3):Eu(3+) nanofibers all exhibit typical red ((5)D(0)-(7)F(J)) emission. The optimum doping concentration of Eu(3+) in the Lu(2)O(3) nanofibers also has been investigated.",

The as-prepared nanocrystalline YVO4:Eu3+ particles are well crystallized with ellipsoidal morphology. The emission of YVO4:Eu3+ particles show emission originating from the 5D0 level, with 5D0-7F2 at 616 nm as the most prominent group. The excitation spectrum fits basically with the absorption spectrum from the vanadate ions. FT-IR and XPS spectra indicate that the surface ligands of nanocrystalline particles were oleic acid and oleylamine. The lifetime for the luminescence of Eu3+ in the as-prepared YVO4:Eu3+ samples are shorter than that of the bulk material due to the absorption of organic ligands on the nanoparticle surface.",

The influences of reaction temperature and the molar ratio of NaF to Y3+ on the crystal phases and shapes of final products have been studied in detail. The aspect ratios of products increase gradually with the increase of reaction temperature and NaF/Y 3+ molar ratio. The growth mechanisms of crystals prepared under the different conditions are presented systematically.

Under the excitation of single wavelength light of 397 nm, the luminescence colors of the corresponding products can be tuned feasibly from bluish white to yellow to red by changing the doping concentration of Eu 3+.

Under UV and electron-beam excitation, the pure Li(2)ZnGeO(4) sample shows a blue emission due to defects, while the Li(2)ZnGeO(4):Mn(2+) sample exhibits a green emission corresponding to the characteristic transition of Mn(2+) ((4)T(1)\u2192(6)A(1)). In particular, the CL intensity (brightness) of Li(2)ZnGeO(4):Mn(2+) is higher than that of commercial green phosphor ZnO:Zn. In addition, the CL properties of Li(2)ZnGeO(4):Mn(2+) phosphor, the dependence of CL intensity on accelerating voltage and filament current, the decay behavior of CL intensity under electron bombardment, and the stability of CIE chromaticity coordinates, have been investigated in detail. The results indicate that the as-prepared Li(2)ZnGeO(4):Mn(2+) phosphor has a good CL intensity and CIE coordinate stability with green emission under low-voltage electron beam excitation. Therefore, Li(2)ZnGeO(4):Mn(2+) is a promising green phosphor for application in full-color field-emission displays.",

        "abstract": "Dy(3+)-doped gallium oxide hydroxides (GaOOH:Dy(3+)) with various morphologies (submicrospindles, submicroellipsoids, 3D hierarchical microspheres) were synthesized by a facile soft-chemical method. After annealing at 1000 degrees C, the GaOOH:Dy(3+) precursor was easily converted to beta-Ga(2)O(3):Dy(3+) phosphors which kept their original morphologies. The as-prepared GaOOH:Dy(3+) and beta-Ga(2)O(3):Dy(3+) products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), low- to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra, and quantum yield (QY). With an increase in pH from 4 to 9, the morphology of GaOOH:Dy(3+) varied from submicrospindles to 3D hierarchical microspheres of self-assembled nanoparticles. A possible mechanism for the formation of various morphologies of GaOOH:Dy(3+) and beta-Ga(2)O(3):Dy(3+) was proposed. Under ultraviolet and low-voltage electron beam excitation, the pure beta-Ga(2)O(3) samples exhibit a blue emission with a maximum at 438 nm originating from the GaO(6) groups, while the beta-Ga(2)O(3):Dy(3+) samples show the characteristic emission of Dy(3+) corresponding to (4)F(9/2) --> (6)H(15/2, 13/2) transitions due to an efficient energy transfer from beta-Ga(2)O(3) to Dy(3+). A simple model was proposed to explain the energy transfer process and luminescence mechanism. Furthermore, the dependence of luminescence intensity on the morphology has been investigated in detail. Under 257 nm UV and electron beam excitation, the beta-Ga(2)O(3):Dy(3+) phosphor with a submicroellipsoid shape shows the highest relative emission intensity and quantum yield compared with other morphologies, and the obtained phosphors have potential applications in the areas of fluorescent lamps and field emission displays (FEDs).",

        "abstract": "Eu(3+) and/or Tb(3+)-doped CaYAlO(4) phosphor samples were synthesized by Pechini-type sol-gel method. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were used to characterize the samples. For CaYAlO(4):Tb(3+), it is shown that the Tb(3+)-doping concentration has a significant effect on the (5)D(3)/(5)D(4) emission intensity of Tb(3+), which is attributed to the cross relaxation from (5)D(3) to (5)D(4). Under the 4f(8)\u2192 4f(7)5d excitation of Tb(3+) or low-voltage electron beams excitation, the CaYAlO(4):Tb(3+) phosphors show tunable luminescence from blue to cyan, and then to green with the change of Tb(3+)-doping concentration. The CaYAlO(4):Eu(3+) samples exhibit a reddish-orange emission of Eu(3+) corresponding to (5)D(0,1)\u2192(7)F(0,1,2,3) transitions. Furthermore, a white emission can be realized in the single phase CaYAlO(4) host by reasonably adjusting the doping concentrations of Tb(3+) and Eu(3+) under low-voltage electron beams excitation. Compared with the commercial blue (Y(2)SiO(5):Ce(3+)) and green (ZnO:Zn) phosphors, CaYAlO(4):0.1%Tb(3+) and CaYAlO(4):5%Tb(3+) phosphors have higher CL intensity and stability under continuous electron bombardment. Due to the excellent CL properties and good CIE chromaticity coordinates, the as-prepared Tb(3+)/Eu(3+)-doped CaYAlO(4) nanocrystalline phosphors have potential application in FEDs devices.",

The FE-SEM images illustrate that CaWO4 and CaWO4 : Pb2+ and CaWO4 : Tb3+ powders are composed of spherical particles with sizes around 260, 290, and 190 nm respectively, which are the aggregates of smaller nanoparticles around 10-20 nm. Under the UV light or electron beam excitation, the CaWO4 powders exhibits a blue emission band with a maximum at about 440 nm. When the CaWO4 particles are doped with Pb2+, the intensity of luminescence is enhanced to some extent and the luminescence band maximum is red shifted to 460 nm.

The Ce(3+) emission at different lattice sites has been identified and discussed. The dual energy transfer of Ce(3+) \u2192 Tb(3+) and Ce(3+) \u2192 Mn(2+) has been investigated. The energy transfer from Ce(3+) to Mn(2+) in CGPS phosphors has been demonstrated to be a resonant type via a dipole-quadrupole mechanism, and the critical distances (R(C)) for Ce(3+) to Mn(2+) calculated by the concentration quenching and spectral overlap methods are 9.71 and 9.15 \u00c5, respectively. A color-tunable emission in CGPS phosphors can be realized by Ce(3+) \u2192 Tb(3+) or Ce(3+) \u2192 Mn(2+) energy transfer. CGPS:0.05Ce(3+)/ 0.15Tb(3+) shows the optimum green emission. Meanwhile, white cathodoluminescence (CL) has been realized in a single-phased Ca(3)Gd(7)(PO(4))(SiO(4))(5)O(2) host by codoping with Ce(3+) and Mn(2+) with CIE (0.322, 0.326). Furthermore, the CL properties of CGPS:Ce(3+)/Tb(3+)/Mn(2+) phosphors, including the dependence of the CL intensity on the accelerating voltage and filament current, the decay behavior of the CL intensity under electron bombardment, and the stability of the CIE chromaticity coordinates, have been investigated in detail. Because of the good CL properties and good CIE chromaticity coordinates, the as-prepared phosphors have potential application in field emission display devices.",

These UCNPs, chosen as optical labels in biological assays and medical imaging, could emit strong green emission under 980 nm laser. The MOF structure based on iron (III) carboxylate materials [MIL-100 (Fe)] possesses high porosity and non-toxicity, which is of great value as nanocarriers for drug storage/delivery. As a unique nanoplatform, the hybrid inorganic-organic drug delivery vehicles show great promising for simultaneous targeted labeling and therapy of cancer cells.",

The hybrid microspheres show bright up-conversion fluorescence under 980 nm laser excitation, and turbidity measurements show that the low critical solution temperature of the polymer shell is thermo- and pH-dependent. We have exploited the hybrid microspheres as carriers for Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) due to its stimuli-responsive property as well as good biocompatibility via MTT assay. It is found that the drug release behavior is pH-triggered thermally sensitive. Changing the pH to mildly acidic condition at physiological temperature deforms the structure of the shell, causing the release of a large number of DOX from the microspheres. The drug-loaded microspheres exhibit an obvious cytotoxic effect on SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The endocytosis process of drug-loaded microspheres is observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy and up-conversion luminescence microscopy. Meanwhile, the as-prepared NaYF(4):Yb(3+)/Er(3+)@SiO(2)@P(NIPAM-co-MAA) microspheres can be used as a luminescent probe for cell imaging. In addition, the extent of drug release can be monitored by the change of up-conversion emission intensity. These pH-induced thermally controlled drug release systems have potential to be used for in vivo bioimaging and cancer therapy by the pH of the microenvironment changing from 7.4 (normal physiological environment) to acidic microenvironments (such as endosome and lysosome compartments) owing to endocytosis.",

Methods: The truncated H1N1 NA coding gene was cloned into plasmid pPICZ\u03b1A to construct the recombinant plasmid pPICZ\u03b1A-NA, which was linearized and then electroporated into P. pastoris SMD1168. The correct transformants were induced by methanol for the expression of recombinant NA, which was then used to construct a high-throughput screening model for the screening of novel NA inhibitors from the extracts of fermentation broths. Results: The recombinant P. pastoris could secrete the truncated NA of H1N1 with catalytic activity. Moreover, its activity was significantly inhibited by oseltamivir and zanamivir, two licensed inhibitors of H1N1 NA. Based on these, more than 20 000 microibal fermentation extracts were screened, and 6 of them showed < 50% inhibition rate in the secondary screening experiment. Conclusion: The truncated NA with catalytic activity could be used to construct the high-throughput model for screening new inhibitors of NA. Compared with purification from virion, the preparation of NA is more convenient and safer from P. pastoris, which would facilitate the development of high-throughput assay for screening novel NA inhibitors. \u00a9 2011 China Pharmaceutical University.",

In this study, to block the downstream metabolic pathway of SA, the shikimate kinase isoenzyme genes aroK and aroL were deleted by Red recombination. Moreover, the key enzyme genes aroG, aroB, tktA and aroE of SA pathway were co-expressed by constructing the recombinant vector pETDuet-GBAE. As a result, SA production of E. coli BW25113 (\u2206aroL/aroK, DE3)/pETDuet-GBAE reached 1,077.6 mg/l when low amounts of sorbitol (5 g/l) were fed in shake flasks. The yield was 3.7 times that when glucose was used (P < 0.05). The results showed that sorbitol was an optimized carbon source for the high efficient accumulation of SA for the first time, which was applicable to use in the industry for high yields and low consumption.",

These compounds are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), magnetic susceptibility measurements and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The magnetic measurements show that the antiferromagnetic interaction is retained in the mixed phases, but the magnetic order is weakened due to manganese ions and iron ions are diluted by each other in the mixed phases. M\u00f6ssbauer spectra show that Fe2+ ions and Fe0+ are co-existent in the mixed phases when 0.1\u2264x\u22640.6. The manganese ions and iron ions form their zigzagging chains, respectively, and a few of the same chains form a group, while manganese ion chain groups and iron ion chain groups are diluted by each other. In the interface between different groups, strong distortions take place in the FeS6 and MnS 6 octahedra, and some electron transformations occur from the 3d band electrons in manganese ions to 4s or 3d bands of the iron ions. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the main iron-bearing mineral in ore-vein is pyrite. The alternation belt contains mainly chlorite and a little lepidocrocite, with less content of pyrite than in ore-vein. There are more original minerals in surrounding rock (diabase of weak alternation) than other belts. The pyrite content decreases with increasing distance of the sampling point to the ore belt.

M\u00f6ssbauer spectra at varied temperatures show there are two transition temperatures, one for paramagnetic (PM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) state at about 330 K, and the other for AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) state at about 180 K. In the latter transition, spin reorientation is observed. The spin of Fe magnetic moment at 6 h is along c axis in AFM state while lie close to ab -plane in FM state.

PACS 75.20.En 33.45.+x Keywords Hf 0.82 Ta 0.18 Fe 2 Laves phase M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy Spin reorientation 1 Introduction Laves phase compound is a typical intermetallics that consists of two kinds of atoms, A and B, with the stoichiometry of 1:2, namely, AB 2 . A series of Laves phase compounds AFe 2 were found and were revealed a wide variety of electronic and magnetic properties, especially in the pseudobinary compounds, in which the A or Fe atoms are partially replaced by some other atoms [1\u20137] . Their magnetic properties can be controlled through altering the concentrations of the substituted atoms. Some open questions still need further studies, although some hypotheses were involved into the macroscopic properties, such as Moriya's interpretations [8,9] . The pseudobinary Laves compound of Hf 1\u2212 x Ta x Fe 2 is an example. It was studied extensively for its typical itinerant electron magnetic properties and its potential applications for its magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect [2,10\u201313] . Nishihara studied the system firstly [3,14,15] , they revealed that the compound is ferromagnetic at low temperature with the Ta concentration 0.1 < x < 0.3 and undergoes a first-order transition to AFM state due to the strong spin fluctuation. At the transition temperature, a large magnetic entropy change was observed [10\u201312] , and magnetic structure at both AFM and FM state is still interesting for detailed research. Many researchers focused on the C15 type Laves phase [16\u201320] , especially for A as rare earth element, but the C14 and C36 type relatively few. The pseudobinary system, Hf 1\u2212 x Ta x Fe 2 was found to crystallize in C14 phase in whole range of x . The magnetic structure was assumed firstly by Nishihara and Yamaguchi [3,14,15] . For Hf 0.8 Ta 0.2 Fe 2 , they supposed that in FM state the spin of Fe atom at both 6 h and 2 a sites are along to the c axis and in the AFM state the spins at 6 h sites is also parallel to c axis but antiferromagnetically coupled on the adjacent layers. The Fe atoms at 2 a sites have no net magnetic moment due to their symmetric structure. Rechenberg et al. argued that about the magnetic moment at the 2 a site at the AFM state [21] , and a local paramagnetic moment was revealed to exist in the 2 a site that vanishes on time average due to fast relaxation with the experimental characteristic time. Dujin et al. gave a result that the spin lies in the ab -plane in the FM state and may be also similar in AFM state by using neutron diffraction technique in their samples [13] . Since the knowledge about magnetic structure at FM state for this system is still limited, it is regarded necessary to exam the spin structure of the system. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy was used to study this system, but the detailed information of the spectra was not given. It should be pointed out that the detailed parameters analysis is very necessary to reveal the spin structures. Herewith, we report our M\u00f6ssbauer studies on the pseudobinary system Hf 0.82 Ta 0.18 Fe 2 , and the spin reorientation was observed. 2 Experimental The compound was prepared by arc-melting appropriate amounts of high pure Hf, Ta, Fe in argon atmosphere and then annealing in quartz tube at 1000 \u00b0C for a week. To avoid inhomogeneous, the raw materials were arc-melted repeatedly. The Fe concentration was kept smaller than about 1% to ensure a sharp FM\u2013AFM transition [10,11] . The real stoichiometric composition of the compounds is Hf 0.82 Ta 0.18 Fe 1.98 . The structure of the compound was examined by X-ray diffraction. M\u00f6ssbauer spectra were measured at the temperature range from 20 to 380 K using a constant acceleration transmission mode with a 57 Co/Pd source for the grinded powder with identical sample thick. The Doppler velocity was calibrated by natural \u03b1-Fe foil, and the spectra central shift (C.S.) is relative to the \u03b1-Fe. To fit the spectra, MossWinn software was used in quadrupolar-perturbed sextet-approximation model and static Hamiltonian model based on genetic arithmetic [22,23] . 3 Results and discussion From the XRD pattern of the sample, it was found to crystallized in a pure C14 type Laves phases with the crystal constant is a = b = 4.93(2) \u00c5, and c = 8.07(3) \u00c5. The value of c / a is about 1.637, which is slightly greater than the ideal value of 1.633. Such distortion may lead to the inequivalent site in the structures [24] . Fig. 1 displays typical M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the pseudobinary compound. At 360 K, the compound shows a paramagnetic doublet. At 250 K, the spectrum shows a magnetic sextet with a paramagnetic doublet. At 90 K, the spectrum is complicated and seemed to be comprised many sets of subspectra. The paramagnetic component does not exist in the ferromagnetic spectrum, which is in good agreement with the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of Nishihara and Yamaguchi [3,14,15] . The spectra fit should be based on the crystal analysis as summarized as follows. As the sample crystallizes in C14 Laves phase with the group space of P 6 3 / mmc , the Hf and Ta atoms occupy the 4 f site with 3 m symmetry. The Fe atoms have two different sites, namely, 2 a and 6 h site with the ratio of 1:3. Their local symmetries are 3 \u00af m , mm 2 for 2 a and 6 h sites, respectively. Thus, the Fe nucleus at the 2 a and 6 h sites have different electric field gradient (EFG) at the exited state according point-charge-calculations. The asymmetry factor, \u03b7 = ( V xx \u2212 V yy )/ V zz , of the Fe nucleus at 2 a sites is zero. The direction of V zz is along to c axis and V zz < 0 , where the V xx , V yy , and V zz are the diagonal components of the EFG tensor. For the Fe nucleus at 6 h sites, \u03b7 \u2260 0, V zz lies in the ab plane, namely, a triangular Kagome net plane, according to the point-charge calculations. The direction seems along [ 1 \u00af \u2009 1 \u2009 0 ] , [1 2 0], [2 1 0] ( Fig. 2 ) and V zz < 0 too. Also the structure has small distortion, it doesn\u2019t lead to any change in local atomic site symmetry as the space group is unaltered [24] . For the mm 2 symmetry at the 6 h site, the directions of V xx and V yy are [0 0 1] [1 1 0], [0 0 1] [1 0 0], [0 0 1] [0 1 0] for the three sets of EFG, respectively, although we cannot conclude a priori which is x -axis. If the spin at 6 h site at FM state lies in the Kagome net plane, several Zeeman patterns for the crystallographically equivalent Fe atoms depending on the orientation of the spin direction with respect to the principal axes of EFG would be observed [25] . So at the ferromagnetic state, the 6 h sites may have at least three sets of magnetic moment if they lie in the Kagome plane. This point conforms to the M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum at 90 K as seen by its broadened sextet in the wing of the spectrum. At PM state the two sites are both paramagnetic. Although there are two inequivalent Fe sites at the compound system, it seems we cannot resolve them into two subspectra. The central shift shows a good linear relation with temperature, and the quadrupole splitting (Q.S.) values keep constant about \u22120.30(8) mm/s, it seems the both sites have very similar electronic state. Also we can observe that both sites have almost the same nearest-neighbor environment. This analysis suggests us to confine both site have the same C.S. values at the spectra at all the temperatures. The spectra at AFM state are analyzed using quadrupolar-perturbed sextet approximation model in MossWinn [22] for the 6 h site. Fig. 3 shows the spectra measured at temperatures from 190 to 330 K. A magnetic sextet and a doublet were observed for the spectra assigned to the 6 h site and 2 a site, respectively. A constant Q.S. value was observed in the state with the value about 0.11(0) mm/s and \u22120.26(5) mm/s for 6 h and 2 a site, respectively, which is similar to the Q.S. at PM state. For the magnetic sextet, the apparent Q.S. is given to first order by (1) Q . S . = \u0394 ( 3 \u2009 co s 2 \u2009 \u03b8 \u2212 1 + \u03b7 \u2009 si n 2 \u2009 \u03b8 \u2009 co s 2 \u03c6 ) / 2 where \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar angle and azimuthal angle of the field direction relative to V zz , and \u03b7 \u2260 0 for the 6 h site Fe atoms. The Q.S. at 2 a site increase slightly compared to that at PM state. It was assumed there are two overlapped doublets at PM but we can\u2019t resolve them. For the 6 h site, combined with the equation at PM, where the apparent Q.S. is given as following: (2) Q . S . = \u0394 1 + \u03b7 2 / 3 the values of \u0394 and \u03b7 were obtained, yielding \u0394 = \u22120.30(4) mm/s, \u03b7 = 0.27(6). In the process, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are respectively constrained to 90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0, else evaluated values cannot give reasonable results. So it can be concluded that the V xx at the 6 h sites is parallel to c axis, and V yy lies in the ab -plane too. The FM M\u00f6ssbauer spectra are showed in Fig. 4 . Since we are determining the Fe moment direction, the spectra were analyzed by solving the complete Hamiltonian for the hyperfine interactions by MossWinn [22] . Attempts to fit the all the spectra with two or three subspectra were unsuccessful, resulting in large \u03c7 2 values. So four sextets were used, which were assigned to the one 2 a site and three inequivalent 6 h sites. The relevant areas were constrained to be equal. This leads us to assume that the three sextets of 6 h sites have the same V zz , \u03b7 , which were equal to the values at AFM and PM state. Fitting with \u03c6 = 90\u00b0 leads to lowest values of \u03c7 2 , which is consistent with above analysis of the spectra at AFM. Only \u03b8 and B hf are the main variable parameters. The \u03b8 values were constrained to equal to \u03b8 , \u03b8 \u00b1 60\u00b0, corresponding to the relative orientation of the three sets of the Fe atoms at the Kagome net of the compounds. The fit parameters in FM state were listed in Table 1 . It can be observed that \u03b8 is about 90\u00b0 for all the FM spectra, which leads us to believe that the Fe moments are directed as in Fig. 2 . The similar values of \u03b8 less than 150\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 30\u00b0 might origin from the distorted Kagome plane, as discussed previously. The magnetic structure is consistent with the previous neutron diffraction studies in FM state [13] . The magnetic structure at 6 h site at FM state is also similar to the other magnetic compound with Kagome net, such as FeSn, ThMn 2 , some RFe 6 X 6 (X = Ge or Sn) compounds [25\u201328] . We also tried the fit process by assuming the coexisting the FM and AFM component in the temperature range of 180\u201320 K [5,6,29] . But it also showed larger \u03c7 2 values, which leads us to believe only magnetic component exists in these spectra. Since 2 a sites are incorporated in the inversion center of the 6 h sublattice, the ferromagnetic arrangement at 6 h site results to strong spin fluctuations at 2 a sites, which destabilizes the dynamics molecular fields on 2 a site at the FM state, yielding a wide range of possible \u03b8 and large line width, which can be observed in Table 1 . Fig. 5 shows hyperfine field dependencies on the temperatures for both sites. As the hyperfine fields, in AFM state, the values at 6 h site are consistent with previous studies [3,14,15] . In FM state, four sets of hyperfine fields were observed for their different occurrence of non-equivalent positions of Fe atoms. At 170 K, the value for 2 a is about 8.2(3) T, which is consistent with the estimation of Ref. [21] . The saturated hyperfine field for 2 a site is about 12 T. The values for 6 h sites are different and all increases with decreasing the temperatures. Such field difference for unique crystallographic site is due to contribution of anisotropic hyperfine fields to the total fields, which can be expressed in general form [25,26] : (3) H = H iso + H a ( 3 \u2009 co s 2 \u2009 \u03b8 \u2212 1 + \u03b7 \u2032 \u2009 si n 2 \u2009 \u03b8 \u2009 cos \u2009 2 \u03c6 ) / 2 where H iso and H a are the isotropic and anisotropic contributions to the total hyperfine field H that parallel to the magnetization direction, and \u03b7 \u2032 is an asymmetry parameter related to the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling tensor, as defined in Ref. [25] .The anisotropic contribution was also observed in Fe 3 Sn 2 , FeSn, RFe 6 X 6 (X = Ge or Sn), et al. [25\u201329] . Fig. 6 shows C.S. dependencies on the temperature. All of C.S. values increase with decreasing temperatures except large dips in AFM state. This can be interpreted by volume contraction [14] . Spin reorientation is a typical phenomenon in some magnets, might originate from a complex crystal\u2013field interactions. For the pseudobinary alloy Hf 1\u2212 x Ta x Fe 2 , the Kagome net is a typical example for its favor of topological geometry fluctuations. The crystal structure, specific heat and electronic properties studies are also indicating the fluctuations. The large volume change at the AFM\u2013FM transition temperature might also come from the spin reorientation, namely, the crystal constant with a decreases discontinuously while c shows only a small change [14] , which strongly suggested there are spin reorientation at the temperature. 4 Conclusion A typical Hf 1\u2212 x Ta x Fe 2 pseudobinary alloy with x = 0.18 is prepared by arc-melting and annealing. XRD patterns reveals its structure belongs to C14 type Laves phase structure with lattice constant a = b = 4.93(2) \u00c5, and c = 8.07(3) \u00c5. M\u00f6ssbauer spectra at various temperatures were measured. It shows the alloy is paramagnetic above 330 K and undergoes a transition at about 330 K. The M\u00f6ssbauer spectra measured at range of 180\u2013330 K show a magnetic sextet and a doublet, which were assigned to the 6 h and 2 a site, respectively. The doublet of 2 a sites is due to that they situate in the inversion center of 6 h sublattice, whose spins are c -aligned but oppositely coupled on adjacent ones. The doublet vanished below 180 K and the both sites show a sextet. The spins of the Fe atoms at 6 h sites lie down close to ab -plane, thus, the spin reorientation phenomenon were observed. The value of \u0394 and asymmetry factor \u03b7 are \u22120.30(4) mm/s, \u22120.26(5) mm/s for 6 h site, respectively. The relevant values for 2 a site are 0.27(6) mm/s and 0. It seems M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to reveal the magnetic structures of these kinds of intermetallic compounds. References [1] M. Saoudi J. D\u00e9portes B. Ouladdiaf J.

The radioactivities of 55 samples have been measured with a low-background HPGe detector. The radioactivity concentrations of (238)U and (40)K ranged from 40.2 to 442 and from 442 to 913 Bq/kg, respectively, while the radioactivity concentration of (232)Th varied only slightly. In order to evaluate the radiological hazard of the natural radioactivity, the radium equivalent activity (Ra(eq)), the absorbed dose rate (D ), the annual effective dose rate and the external hazard index (H(ex)) have been calculated and compared with the internationally approved values. The study provides background radioactivity concentrations in a granite area, specifically, the area in the vicinity of a uranium mine in Southern China. The data can be used in exploring granite-type uranium deposits.",

        "abstract": "Agile methodologies use user stories to capture software requirements. This often results in team members over emphasizing their understanding of the goals, without proper incorporation of goals from other stakeholders or customers. Existing UML or other goal oriented modeling methods tend to be overly complex for non-technical stakeholders to properly express their goals and communicate them to the agile team. In this paper, we propose a light weight Goal Net based method to model goal requirements in agile software development process to address this problem. It can be used to decompose complex processes into phased goals, and model low level user stories to high level hierarchy goal structures. Our preliminary analysis and studies in educational software engineering contexts show that it can improve agile team's group awareness to project goals and, thus, improve team productivity and artifact quality. The proposed approach was evaluated in university level agile software engineering projects. It has achieved an improvement of over 50 percentage points in terms of the proportion of high quality user stories generated by students compared to the standard user story template used in Scrum.",

        "abstract": "Task allocation decisions are critical for the success of Agile teams yet not well understood. Traditional survey/interview based methods limit the scale and level of details of data collection. As agile project management (APM) tools are increasingly adopted, they offer a mechanism for unobtrusively collecting behavior data to support research. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of APM tool based method of studying task allocation decision-making in agile software engineering compared to survey/interview based methods. Through the proposed HASE online APM tool, we conducted a study involving 20 novice Agile teams consisting of 119 undergraduate software engineering students over an 8 week period. Analysis of the collected data provides insight into the effects of novice Agile team members' competence and the difficulty of the tasks assigned on them on their workload variation, their confidence, and the timeliness of completion of these tasks. These findings can be useful in designing situation-aware task allocation decision support systems to serve Agile teams.",

How effective are these strategies under different conditions? These questions are important since they have significant implications to the ongoing research of reputation aware task delegation in multi-agent systems (MASs). In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to address the aforementioned research questions by providing a gamified mechanism for people to report the reputation-aware task delegation strategies they adopt. The findings from this empirical study may help MAS researchers develop multi-agent trust evaluation testbeds with more realistic simulated human behaviours.",

        "abstract": "During playing educational game, the emotion of players can be affected by many aspects, for example the play time, the study time, and achievements etc. Player's emotional status is an internal, dynamic and comprehensive factor that is hard to be detected or predicted by system, which may consist of the interestingness to the game, the internal status of player, or the excitement to the score and so on. In order to predict student's emotional status and to simulate relative emotion state transitions during playing game, we propose a novel method, based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) modeling method. Several experiments and simulations are provided to illustrate the approach and modeling process in this paper. The results show that players'emotion states can be simulated and computed relatively in educational game by the method.",

        "abstract": "A trial was established in 1999 in Lechang, Guangdong, which included 17 hybrid families of Pinus elliottii var. elliotii(PEE) by P. caribaea var. hondurensis(PCH), 4 hybrid families of PEE by P. caribaea var. bahmensis (PCB), 9 PEE open-pollinated families (PEE(op)) and 1 PCH open-pollinated family (PCH(op)), as well as 8 seedlots from pine seed orchards in Guangdong province. These seed orchards were primary PEE seed orchard (PEE(p)) in Taishan, first-generation PEE orchard (PEE(o)) in Taishan, improved PEE seed orchards (PEE(i)) in Taishan, primary P. caribaea var. caribaea seed orchard (PCC(p)) in Zhanjiang, primary PCB seed orchard (PCB(p)) in Zhanjiang, primary PCH seed orchard (PCH(p)) in Zhanjiang, primary P. taeda seed orchard (PTA(p))in Yingde, primary P. massoniana seed orchard(PMA(p)) in Ruyuan, respectively. The trial was investigated for survival rate, at the end of the planting year. And the height and diameter at breast height (dbh) of individual trees were measured at age 6. Then, preserving rate and individual volume were calculated respectively. The average survival rate of 21 hybrid families was 96.2%, and preserving rate was 87.2%. There were most significant differences between all tested taxa for their increment. The order of volume between taxa was PEE PCH > PEE PCB > PCH(p) > PMA (p) > PCH(op) > PEE (op) > PEE (i) > PEE(p) > PCB (p) > PCC (p) > PEE(o) > PTA (p). Ten hybrid families were selected in the trial for their better growth performance. Their average height, dbh and volume were 6.35 m, 10.85 cm and 0.035 48 m3, respectively. Their real average gains were 59.39%, 48.76%, 134.97%, 162.23% and 172.29% for volume respectively, compared to PMA(p), PCH (p), PCB (p), PEE(o) and PTA(p).",

Their behavior, characterization, and binding ability were investigated in both solution and the solid state by means of UV-vis, NMR, XRD, DSC and SEM. The results show that the water solubility and solution stability obviously increased in the inclusion complex with cyclodextrins. Meanwhile, the inclusion complexes still retained anticancer activity against A549 and MCF-7 cells, similar to free Epothilone A. This satisfactory water solubility, high solution stability, and high anticancer activity of the Epothilone A/CD complexes will be potentially useful as an anticancer therapy.",

The protocol has the advantages of being highly efficient and environmentally benign, with excellent yields and easy work-up, making it suitable for large-scale and parallel combination synthesis.

        "abstract": "Branched polystyrene was first obtained via a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process in the presence of chain transfer monomer p-vinyl benzene sulfonyl chloride (VBSC) in benzene at 60 oC with 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)prop-2-yl dithiobenzoate as the RAFT agent and 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator. During the RAFT polymerization, VBSC played the role of branching agent. It could not only copolymerized but also acted as a chain transfer agent due to the polymerizable vinyl group and sulfonyl chloride chain transfer group in the VBSC. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces demonstrated that the number-average molecular weights and molecular weight distributions increased along with monomer conversion. Compared with the RAFT process without VBSC, the resulting polymers had broad molecular weight distributions and the sulfonyl functionality of the resultant polymer at the branching point, indicating the formation of branched polystyrene. The structure of the obtained polystyrene was further analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. The findings indicated that the branched polystyrene was mainly formed via the RAFT copolymerization of VBSC and styrene firstly to form polystyrene bearing pendant sulfonyl chloride group, and then the pendant sulfonyl chloride group acted as the chain transfer agent to generate the branched structure. In addition, the degree of branching and VBSC unit in copolymer increased along with the VBSC in the feed, implying that composition and structure of the branched polystyrenes could be tuned by the amount of VBSC in the feed.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we embarked on a structural optimization campaign aiming at the discovery of novel anti-angiogenesis agents with previously reported imidazole kinase inhibitors as a lead compound. A library of 29 compounds has been synthesized. Several title compounds exhibited selective inhibitory activities against VEGFR-2 kinase than EGFR kinases, which also displayed selective anti-proliferation potency against three cancer cells. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for anti-angiogenesis capability by CAM assay. Among them, compound 5n showed the most potent anti-angiogenesis ability, the efficient cytotoxic activities (in vitro against HUVEC, H1975, A549 and Hela cell lines with IC50 values of 8.46, 1.40, 7.61, and 0.28 \u00b5M, respectively), and acceptable VEGFR-2 kinase inhibition (IC50 = 0.25 \u00b5M). The molecular docking analysis revealed d 5n is a Type II inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase. In general, these results indicated these 6-arylurea-2-arylbenzoxazole/benzimidazole derivatives are promising inhibitors of VEGFR-2 kinase for the potential treatment of anti-angiogenesis.",

A series of highly functionalized 2,4-diaminoquinazolines 4-5 were then synthesized based on 3a-3c. The anticancer activities of compounds 3-5 were evaluated in vitro against human cell lines such as Skov-3, HL-60, A431, A549, and HepG-2. Some of the compounds showed excellent cytotoxic activity and 5a was found to be the most potent derivative, with an IC(50) value lower than 2.5 microg/mL against the five tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin. Representative compounds were also preliminarily evaluated as HIV-1 inhibitors in vitro, and 3c showed the most potent anti-HIV-1 activity with EC(50) values of 0.6 and 1.6 microg/mL, and TI values of >59.6 and 66.6, respectively.",

The results showed that with increasing VBSC in the feed, the degree of branching\n and VBSC unit in the copolymer increased and a shortest polystyrene arm arose from the highest VBSC content in the feed, suggesting\n that the composition and structure of the branched polystyrenes could be tuned by the amount of VBSC in the feed. By tracing\n the structure change in the copolymer at various stages of polymerization, the main polymerization process can be regarded\n as the copolymerization of VBSC with styrene first and then chain transfer to polymeric radical to form branched polystyrene.\n This strategy is facile and less expensive than the other method.",

        "abstract": "A one-step, transition-metal-free protocol, involving facile post-treatment, for the regioselective synthesis of 1,3-diazaheterocycle fused [1,2-a][1,8]naphthyridine derivatives (3) from 2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehydes (ClQuAlds) (1) and heterocyclic ketene aminals (HKAs) (2) was developed via a joint experimental-computational approach. The computational prediction of the reactivity of two series of synthons was applied in the process of optimizing the reaction conditions, which relied on density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with concepts of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory and quantitative structure-reactivity relationship (QSRR) presumptions. The combined results enabled the proposal of a pre-synthetic prediction of global reactivity. The fully consistent results of the synthetic experiments with the in silico evaluation confirmed the rationality, effectiveness, and practicability of the new strategy. Notably, the joint method is not limited to the laboratory, but has applications ranging from routine to industry. This approach is likely to yield numerous insights to accelerate HKA-related synthetic chemistry that can be extended to numerous heterocycles. It thus opens up a novel entry towards rapidly investigating the reactivity of novel synthons with unique properties, a further step towards exploiting cascade reactions by avoiding the futile waste of time and resources.",

The results showed that the SCU could be efficiently encapsulated in the cyclodextrin cavity in aqueous solution to produce complexes that were more soluble than free SCU. The enhanced binding ability of cyclodextrins towards SCU was discussed from the viewpoint of the size/shape-fit and multiple recognition mechanism between host and guest. \u00a9 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

As a result, a series of quinolone-4-carboxamides were produced through a novel cascade reaction mechanism. This reaction involved the formation of the quinoline ring accompanied by the formation of an amide bond in one step. Accordingly, this protocol is suitable for combinatorial and parallel syntheses of quinolone-4-carboxamide drugs or natural products.",

        "abstract": "A novel series of benzylidene-succinimide derivatives were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for their cytotoxicities against HCT116, and SW480 cancer cells and NCM460 normal human cells. Their antiangiogenic capabilities were evaluated using a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The compound, XCF-37b, was selected as the most potent antiangiogenic inhibitor with noncytotoxicity to evaluate the pharmacological effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cancer cells in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. The results showed that XCF-37b inhibited HT29-cell colon tumor growth in\u00a0vivo, without showing cytotoxicity against the five other cancer cell lines in\u00a0vitro. Experiments confirmed that XCF-37b had obvious antiangiogenic activity by HUVEC migration and invasion and rat aortic ring angiogenesis ex\u00a0vivo. Mechanism studies showed that XCF-37b inhibited the AKT/mTOR and VEGFR2 signaling pathways, as evidenced by decreased expressions of phosphor-AKT (p-AKT), p-mTOR, p-VEGFR2 (Tyr175), p-Src (Tyr416), p-FAK (Tyr925), and p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204). Moreover, XCF-37b significantly decreased the protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). XCF-37b generally regulated angiogenic inhibition through several regulatory pathways, without significantly interfering with colorectal cancer cell growth.",

The results show that the water solubility of azadirachtin was obviously increased after resulting inclusion complex with cyclodextrins. Typically, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DMbetaCD), permethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (TMbetaCD), and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) are found to be able to solubilize azadirachtin to high levels up to 2.7, 1.3, 3.5, and 1.6 mg/mL (calculated as azadirachtin), respectively. This satisfactory water solubility and high thermal stability of the cyclodextrin-azadirachtin complexes, will be potentially useful for their application as herbal medicine or healthcare products.",

The in vitro antitumor activity of the target compounds has been evaluated against HCT-116, MCF-7, K562, and SGC-7901 cell lines. The pharmacological results showed that most of the prepared compounds display excellent selective cytotoxicity toward HCT-116, MCF-7, and K562 cell lines. Particularly, compounds 10c, 10f and 10g show high inhibitory activity on these human cancer cell lines (IC50: 2.39-9.34 \u03bcM). Conversely, all compounds are generally inactive against SGC-7901, with only 10b having IC\u2085\u2080 below 50 \u03bcM.",

        "abstract": "A series of polyhalo heterocyclic ketene aminals (polyhalo-HKAs) were synthesized under solvent-free conditions and evaluated in vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. Trifluoro-HKAs were the most cytotoxic compounds, followed by difluoro-HKAs and trichloro-HKAs. Trichloro-HKAs were more potent against the tumor cell lines Skov-3, Hep-2, K562, and A431 than difluoro-HKAs. An ethoxycarbonyl at the 2-position of the polyhalo HKAs gave the highest activity. Ethoxycarbonyl substituted 5o, bearing three fluorine atoms on the isophthalonitrile ring, was found to be the most potent derivative with IC(50) values lower than 3.7microg/mL against five human tumor cell lines making it more active than cisplatin (DDP).",

To pursue its promising application, cyclodextrin was used for forming complexes to overcome its drawbacks such as poor water solubility and stability. So, GA-13315/CD complexes were prepared with native \u03b2-cyclodextrin and its derivatives (hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD)) and their inclusion complexation behavior, characterization and binding ability in both solution and the solid state was studied by means of UV, XRD, DSC, SEM, (1)H and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that the complexes still maintain antitumor activities, compared with GA-13315 or adriamycin (ADM, positive control) as the positive control. The results showed that the water solubility and stability of GA-13315 were obviously improved in the inclusion complex with cyclodextrins, suggesting the inclusion complexes as promising future therapeutic agents.",

        "title": "Artemether/hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin host\u2013guest system: Characterization, phase-solubility and inclusion mode",
        "abstract": "Abstract An inclusion complex of the antimalarial artemether (ATM) in hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD) was prepared and characterized. The phase-solubility diagram for the drug showed an increase in water solubility and gave an apparent binding constant of 220 M \u22121 . According to 1 H NMR and 2D NMR spectroscopy (ROESY), the inclusion mode involves two CH 3 from the drug orientated in the HP\u03b2CD cavity. The complex was characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. In addition, the complex produces a 1.81-fold enhancement in apparent bioavailability compared to artemether. Keywords Artemether Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin Characterization Phase-solubility Inclusion mode 1 Introduction Malaria has a devastating effect throughout tropical regions. There are approximately 300\u2013500 million clinical cases each year resulting in 1.5\u20132.7 million deaths. Nearly all fatal cases are caused by Plasmodium falciparum . 1 The problem is compounded by the spread of drug resistant strains of the parasite. As a result, traditional alkaloid drugs such as chloroquine and quinine are now largely ineffective. 2 The spread of parasite resistance has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict that without new antimalarial drug intervention, the number of cases of malaria will have doubled by the year 2010. 3 Artemisinin (Qinghaosu) is a sesquiterpene 1,2,4-trioxane (sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide) isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb qinghao ( Artemisia annua L.). In 1979 it was shown to be an effective antimalarial against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum . 4 This compound and its derivatives, such as artemether (ATM), dihydroartemisinin, arteether, and artesunate, are effective against both chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive strains of P. falciparum , as well as against cerebral malaria. 5,6 Most countries where malaria is endemic have adopted the WHO recommendation of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for fast and reliable malaria treatment. 7 However, artemisinin\u2019s poor solubility in both oil and water, and hydrolytic instability of the lactone function, have led scientists to prepare a series of semisynthetic first generation analogues, such as ATM ( Chart 1 ). 8 Although ATM is a potent antimalarial, poor bioavailability and rapid clearance are observed with it and the other derivatives in both human and animal models. 9 Cyclodextrins (CDs) are truncated-cone polysaccharides mainly composed of six to eight d -glucose monomers linked by \u03b1-1,4-glucose bonds. They have a hydrophobic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface and can encapsulate model substrates to form host\u2013guest complexes or supramolecular species. This usually enhances drug solubility in aqueous solution and affects the chemical characteristics of the encapsulated drug. 10\u201313 Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD, Chart 2 ) is a hydroxyalkylated \u03b2CD derivative that combines relatively high water solubility with low toxicity and satisfactory inclusion ability. 14,15 Several commercial formulations are composed of cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, illustrating the usefulness of this approach. 16\u201319 The latest research indicates that HP\u03b2CD complexation with dihydroartemisinin increases dihydroartemisinin solubility and stability. 20 In this work we studied the formation of an inclusion complex of ATM with HP\u03b2CD. We utilized phase-solubility techniques, molecular modeling by 1 H NMR and 2D NMR spectroscopy (Rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy, ROESY) and characterized the complex by Powder X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. We focused on the binding behaviors of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin with ATM and the solubilization effect of HP\u03b2CD toward ATM, as these may provide a useful approach to produce novel ATM formulations with high bioavailability. 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Phase-solubility The phase-solubility diagram of the HP\u03b2CD/ATM system ( Fig. 1 ) showed drug solubility increased linearly with increasing HP\u03b2CD concentration. This diagram can be classified as A L type according to the model proposed by Higuchi and Connors. 21 It can be related to the formation of a soluble inclusion complex. The apparent stability constant ( K 1:1 ), was calculated from the linear fit of the curve according to the following equation: K 1 : 1 = Slope S 0 ( 1 - Slope ) where Slope is the value found in the linear regression and So is the aqueous solubility of the drug at pH 7 ( So = 140 mg/l) in the absence of HP\u03b2CD, determined using HPLC by Hu. 22 This gave a K 1:1 of 220 \u00b1 25 M \u22121 at 25 \u00b0C, suggesting a favorable interaction occurs as in general drug-CD association constants are reported in the range 50\u20132000 M \u22121 . 23 2.2 Inclusion mode In order to explore the possible inclusion mode of the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex, we compared the 1 H NMR spectra of HP\u03b2CD in the absence and presence of ATM ( Fig. 2 ). The 1 H resonances of HP\u03b2CD were assigned according to the reported method. 24,25 As illustrated in Figure 2 , the majority of ATM chemical shifts were between \u03b4 0.5 and 3 ppm and distinct from those of the HP\u03b2CD protons. After inclusion complexation with ATM, the H-3 proton of HP\u03b2CD shifted 0.010 ppm and the H-5 proton of HP\u03b2CD shifted 0.002 ppm ( Table 1 ). Both H-3 and H-5 protons are located in the interior of the CD cavity, with H-3 protons near the wide side of cavity and H-5 protons near the narrow side. These results may indicate that ATM should be included in the HP\u03b2CD cavity from the wide side. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy provides important information about the spatial proximity between host and guest atoms by observation of intermolecular dipolar cross-correlations. Two protons closely located in space can produce a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross-correlation in NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) or ROESY. The presence of NOE cross-peaks between protons from two species indicates spatial contacts within 0.4 nm. 26 To gain more conformational information, we obtained 2D ROESY of the inclusion complex of ATM with HP\u03b2CD ( Fig. 3 ), including a partial contour plot ( Fig. 3 , inset). The ROESY spectrum of the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex shows appreciable correlation of H-13 and H-14 protons of ATM with H-3 protons of HP\u03b2CD. No correlation is observed between H-5 and H-15 protons of ATM and H-5 or H-3 protons of the cyclodextrin. These results indicate that the CH 3 of the A and B rings of ATM are included in the HP\u03b2CD cavity. In combination with the 1:1 inclusion stoichiometry observed in the phase-solubility diagram, a possible inclusion mode for the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex is proposed ( Fig. 4 ). 2.3 X-ray diffraction of the inclusion complex Powder XRD patterns allow examination of the medium and long range ordering of materials. 26 In contrast to the amorphous character of HP\u03b2CD ( Fig. 5 a), free ATM is a crystalline solid ( Fig. 5 b). The XRD pattern of the physical mixture confirmed the presence of both species as isolated solids, as the diffractogram showed both ATM peaks and the amorphous halo of HP\u03b2CD ( Fig. 5 c). The lyophilized inclusion complex has an amorphous structure ( Fig. 5 d), probably due to both the structure of HP\u03b2CD and the lyophilization process; this is evidence of the absence of ATM crystalline particles. 2.4 Thermal analysis of the inclusion complex The thermal properties of the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Analysis of the TG curves showed that ATM decomposes at ca. 170 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 a) and HP\u03b2CD at ca. 360 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 b). However, their inclusion complex had different thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature of ca. 365 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 d). In contrast, the physical mixture of HP\u03b2CD and ATM apparently contains only the free species, as indicated by decomposition temperatures due to ATM at 170 \u00b0C and HP\u03b2CD at 360 \u00b0C ( Fig. 6 c). These results indicate that ATM\u2019s usual thermal properties were altered after inclusion complexation. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram provides further information about the thermal properties of the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex. The DSC curve of ATM displays an exothermic peak at 170 \u00b0C ( Fig. 7 a). In contrast, the DSC curve of pure HP\u03b2CD shows endothermic peaks at 80 and 360 \u00b0C ( Fig. 7 b), indicating HP\u03b2CD loses water at temperatures slightly above 80 \u00b0C and decomposes above 360 \u00b0C. The physical mixture of HP\u03b2CD and ATM apparently contains only the free species ( Fig. 7 c). However, in the DSC curve of the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex, the exothermic peak at about 170 \u00b0C corresponding to the free ATM disappears, while two new endothermic peaks appear at 80 and 365 \u00b0C ( Fig. 7 d). This suggests that the HP\u03b2CD/ATM complex is more stable than ATM. We propose that this result may be related to the complexation of HP\u03b2CD with ATM. 2.5 Bioavailability studies in the rats The plasma concentration\u2013time profiles of artemether are shown in Figure 8 . The mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a non-compartmental analysis are presented in Table 2 . Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after parenteral administration of artemether suspension ( n = 6) show a constant of C max of 218.78 \u03bcg/ml, T max of 89.32 min, and a AUC 0\u2013480 of 62038.65 \u03bcg min/ml. C max of the complex (490.22 \u03bcg/ml) is higher than that of the suspension. This difference may be due to fast dissolution and absorption of the complex in the solution, a rapid and quantitative breakdown to yield high circulating concentrations once absorbed. On the other hand, T max is significantly lower for the complex (29.52 min) in comparison to the artemether suspension. There is some difference between the AUC of complex (112137.89 \u03bcg min/ml) and the suspension. The apparent bioavailability of artemether following complex administration was found to be 181% compared to the artemether suspension. Thus, the results above indicated that complex had a much higher rate and extent of bioavailability compared to artmether suspension. 3 Conclusion In summary, the complexation behavior, characterization and bioavailability of an inclusion complex of ATM with HP\u03b2CD were investigated. Results showed that HP\u03b2CD could enhance the watersolubility and bioavailability of ATM. Considering the lack of ATM applications, the complex could prove useful in the design of novel medicinal ATM formulations. 4 Experimental 4.1 Materials ATM (FW = 298, PC >99%) was obtained from Kunming Pharmaceutical Corporation (Yunnan Province, P R China). Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (average FW = 1380) was purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Chemical Corporation (Shanghai, P R China) and used as received. Other reagents and chemicals were of analytical reagent grade. All experiments were carried out using ultrapure water. 4.2 HPLC assay An Agilent 1100 HPLC system was used to determine the amount of ATM. The Agilent HPLC system was equipped with G1311A pump and controller, G1315B UV absorption detector, and G1313A autosampler. A Lichrospher C 18 HPLC column (Hanbon, 5 \u03bcm, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, CHA) was used for separation and the mobile phase was water\u2013acetonitrile (40:60, v/v). The injection volume was 20 \u03bcl and the effluent with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was monitored at an absorption wavelength of 210 nm. 4.3 Preparation of inclusion complexes The inclusion complex was prepared by the suspension method. 27 This involved mixing of ATM and HP\u03b2CD in a 1:1 molar proportion with stirring at room temperature for 48 h protected from light to prevent degradation. The solid residue was then separated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min and the upper liquid layer was filtered over a 0.45 \u03bcm Millipore membrane. The solution was then dried by lyophilization and the resulting solid inclusion complex collected. A physical mixture, to test for possible inclusion, was prepared by grinding together a 1:1 molar mixture of HP\u03b2CD and ATM for 5 min with a small amount of water (the minimum amount to form a slurry) in an agate mortar. 4.4 Phase-solubility diagram The phase-solubility diagram was studied according to the method proposed by Higuchi and Connors. 21 A series of HP\u03b2CD solutions were prepared with increasing concentrations: 0.01\u20130.25 M. A constant mass of ATM, in fivefold molar excess relative to the highest concentration HP\u03b2CD solution, was added to each solution and the suspensions stirred for 48 h in the dark. Following this, all suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatants were filtered over 0.45 \u03bcm Millipore membranes and analyzed by HPLC. This experiment was repeated three times. 4.5 Characterization of the complexes 1 H NMR spectra for HP\u03b2CD and ATM were obtained on a Bruker Avance DRX500 spectrometer at 298 K in D 2 O and CDCl 3 , respectively. ROESY experiments were run on a Bruker Avance DRX500 instrument. Samples were equilibrated for at least 24 h before measurement. All 2D NMR experiments were carried out in D 2 O. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured in a D/max-3B diffractometer using Cu-\u03ba\u03b1 ( k = 1,5460 A\u00b0) with 30 mA, 40 kV, and a scanning rate of 5\u00b0/min. Powder samples were mounted on a sample holder and scanned with a step size of 2 \u03b8 = 0.02\u00b0 between 2 \u03b8 = 3\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. Thermal analyses (TG and DSC) were recorded using a NETZSCH STA449F 3 instrument, with a 10 \u00b0C/min heating rate from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C and under N 2 flow (100 ml/min). 4.6 Bioavailability studies in the rats Bioavailability studies in the rats were performed according to the reported method. 28 Formulation preparation: artemether (60 mg) were suspended in 10 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.5% of sodium methylcellulose; Oral solution was prepared by dissolving 2460 mg of artemether/hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin complex in 10 ml of ddwater to make a concentration 6 mg/ml of artemether. Rat experiment: Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (weight range 280\u2013300 g), after fasting overnight, were randomly treatmented the oral solution of artemether complex and artemether suspension ( n = 6). The dosages were all 10.8 mg/day kg. Before blood sampling, the animals were anesthetized with diethyl ether. Blood samples of 0.4 ml were taken from the ophthalmic venus plexus and put into heparinized tubes at 12, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 4200 and 4800 min after administration. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and 200 \u03bcl of plasma was quickly removed and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until HPLC analyses. Treatment of plasma samples: A 200 \u03bcl portion of plasma was added 50 \u03bcl 1% phosphoric acid solution and was vortexed for 3 min and kept for 5 min. Methanol (0.4 ml) was added and the mixture was vortexed for 3 min, then was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The organic phase was transferred into new tubes and the contents evaporated to dryness under a stream of air at approximately 40 \u00b0C. The dried extracts were reconstituted with 150 \u03bcl of mobile phase solution, vortexed at high speed for 3 min, and centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The entire volume of the reconstituted material (150 \u03bcl) was transferred to autosampler vials and 50 \u03bcl (sample volume) was injected onto the HPLC. Pharmacokinetics and statistical analysis: The plasma concentration\u2013time data of artemether were fitted by 3P87 Pharmacokinetics Program (The Section of Mathematical Pharmacology of Chinese Mathematical Pharmacological Society) and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The area under the concentration\u2013time curve (AUC 0\u2013 t ) was determined with trapezium method. C max and T max were determined through the observation of individual animal concentration versus time curses. The apparent bioavailability ( F app ) of the artemether following administration of the complex was calculated by dividing the artemether AUC following complex dosing by that from suspension dosing. Statistical significance was indicated with P <0.01.

        "abstract": "Herein, we have carried out a structural optimization campaign to discover the novel anti-tumor agents with our previously screened YQY-26 as the hit compound. A library of thirty-seven 6-amide-2-aryl benzoxazole/benzimidazole derivatives has been designed and synthesized based on the highly conserved active site of VEGFR-2. Several title compounds exhibited selective inhibitory activities against VEGFR-2 than EGFR kinases, which also displayed selective anti-proliferation potency against the HUVEC and HepG2 than the A549 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for anti-angiogenesis capability by chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Among them, compounds 9d showed the most potent anti-angiogenesis ability (79% inhibition at 10 nM/eggs), the efficient cytotoxic activities (in\u00a0vitro against the HUVEC and HepG2 cell lines with IC values of 1.47 and 2.57\u202f\u03bcM, respectively), and excellent VEGFR-2 kinase inhibition (IC\u202f=\u202f0.051\u202f\u03bcM). The molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 9d is a Type II inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase. These results indicated that the 6-amide-2-arylbenzoxazole and 6-amide-2-aryl benzimidazole derivatives are promising inhibitors of VEGFR-2 kinase for the potential treatment of anti-angiogenesis.",

This protocol represents a route to obtain a novel class of quinone methide substituted neonicotinoid derivatives in a concise, rapid, and practical manner.

The alternative protocol provided a wide substrate scope with excellent yields (82-95%), and a variety of ortho-amino triarylphosphines were obtained with high yields (87-95%) via further reductive reaction. Furthermore, the reaction could be scaled-up and several synthetic transformations were accomplished for the construction of functionalized organophosphorus.",

The highly efficient, catalyst-free and one pot synthesis serves as a nice addition to group-assisted-purification (GAP) chemistry, and the pure products were obtained simply by washing the crude products with 95% ethanol.",

In this study, a new category of \"two-in-one\" fluorescent xanthone inhibitors was developed for the systematic evaluation of anticancer activity and the selective imaging of cytoplasm in vitro. These xanthone inhibitors presented high fluorescent brightness, working over a wide pH range enabled by a \"switchable reaction\" of the heterocyclic backbone. The strength and nature of fluorescence were probed via spectroscopic methods and density functional theory calculations on the molecular level, respectively. Along with the potent anticancer activity, which was demonstrated using MTT and clonogenic assays with high fluorescent brightness in the cytoplasm, SLI  could be established as a modeled self-monitoring drug in cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "An efficient, environmentally benign, and inexpensive procedure has been developed for the synthesis of fluorinated 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines by microwave irradiation using basic alumina as a solid-support agent as well as a solid base. Notably, this protocol features improved energy efficiency, broad isothiourea substrate scope, easily available starting materials, and high atom efficiency and applicability toward gram-scale synthesis. Additionally, the target compounds were evaluated for the cytotoxic effect against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT116 and HT29), human gastric cancer (SGC-7901), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells, and it was found that these compounds have excellent antitumor activities. Among them, compound  was found to be one of the most potent derivatives with IC values lower than 9.44 \u03bcM against five human tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin (DDP). Furthermore, for the first time, the fluorinated 2-alkylthio-substituted 4-aminoquinazolines were identified as phosphatase CDC25B inhibitors.",

The targeted compound was efficiently obtained by filtration without further post-treatment. In the one-pot two step reaction, C\u2014C and C\u2550N bonds were constructed, while at the same time one C\u2014O bond was cleaved. This protocol represents a valuable route to obtain highly functional bicyclic pyridinium derivatives in a concise, rapid, and practical manner.

The antitumor bioactivity screening showed that certain compounds had potent antitumor activity. Especially, compounds 3r, which showed the most potent activity with IC50 values lower than 12.3 \u03bcmol L\u22121 against four human tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin (DDP).

Among them, compound 7b displayed potent cytotoxic activity in vitro against SK-OV-3 and HCT116 cell lines with IC values of 0.5 and 0.2\u03bcM, respectively. In general, the antiproliferative activity was correlated with the binding property of the colchicine binding site and inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization. In addition, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis revealed that selected compounds caused disruption of the mitotic spindle assembly and G/M phase arrest of the cell cycle, which correlated with proliferation inhibitory activity. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated the interaction of 7b at the colchicine binding site of tubulin. These results indicate these compounds are promising inhibitors of tubulin polymerization for the potent treatment of cancer.",

        "abstract": "A novel water-soluble oral satraplatin/\u03b2-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was prepared and characterized with a variety of techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to clarify its inclusion mechanism. Enabled by encapsulation with cyclodextrin, the water solubility of satraplatin was successfully increased to 7.4 mg mL\u22121 and significantly improved by phase solubility studies. Meanwhile, the stability of satraplatin in acidic and weak alkaline aqueous solution was also effectively enhanced by forming the inclusion complex. Importantly, in an in vitro cytotoxicity test, the satraplatin encapsulated complex displayed superior cytotoxicity compared to free satraplatin against A549 and MCF-7 cells but was almost non-toxic to Caco-2 cells. In an in vivo antitumor test, this satraplatin encapsulated complex has shown much better activity in repressing lung cancer than free satraplatin but nearly no damage to intestinal mucosa by oral administration evaluated in xenograft mice models. Overall, the development of the current satraplatin/\u03b2-cyclodextrin inclusion complex has significantly improved the bioavailability of satraplatin and could benefit further applications in related pharmaceutical formulations.",

The inclusion complexation behavior, characterization and interactions of PD with CDs were investigated in both the solution and the solid state by means of UV\u2013vis, ESI-MS, NMR, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TG and DSC. All of the characterization information demonstrated the formation of PD/CDs inclusion complex, and the PD/CDs inclusion complexes exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from PD. The 1:1 stoichiometry of the complexes was visually proven with the ESI-MS experiment and Jobu0027s method. Meanwhile, it was the phenyl group (a and b rings) of the PD molecule that were included in the CDs cavity from the wide side. Moreover, the water solubility of PD/CDs was significantly improved from 0.161\u00a0mg/mL to 7.21\u00a0mg/mL (PD/\u03b2-CD) and 12.02\u00a0mg/mL (PD/\u03b3-CD). Consequently, the bioavailability of PD/CDs inclusion complexes were effectively improved over free PD in vitro. The present study provides useful information for the potential application of complexation with PD, a naturally occurring hydrophobic polyphenolic compounds herbal medicine.",

In the preliminary plant growth regulation assay, GA/CDs displays superior bioactivity compared to pure GA to help with the early seedling growth of cucumber and mung bean and the root growth of cucumber and mung bean, respectively. The results showed that there was a certain relationship between the inclusion ability, stability and bioactivity. The inclusion stability constants of gibberellin clathrate are consistent with the order of stabilities of the inclusion complex. Among these complexes, GA/HP-\u03b2-CD possess highest inclusion constant, and the binding ability of the HP-\u03b2-CD not only enhances the stability of gibberellic acid in the stability test but also plays a slow release role in the bioactivity assay. Therefore, the complex of GA may be used as a promising plant growth regulator.",

We have exploited a new catalytic polymerization process and developed the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling enabled synthesis of cross-conjugated polymers with readily accessible N-tosylhydrazones and aryl halides. A broad scope of cross-conjugated polymers with good processability and thermal stability has been prepared in high yields using dialkylbiarylphospine\u2013Pd precatalysts. Owing to their unique vinyl structures, these polymers could be easily modified in postpolymerization fashions to impart high degrees of structural complexities. Moreover, these materials were shown to have interesting and tunable optical and conductive properties, featuring their great potentials in a variety of applications.",

Properties of the obtained complexes, as well as the interactions between each component, were systematically investigated in both solution and solid states by means of ESI-MS, NMR, FT-IR, XRD, DSC, SEM etc. All characterization information demonstrated that FIT/CDs inclusion complexes were formed, and exhibited different spectroscopic features and properties from FIT. A complex with 1:1 stoichiometry of FIT and CDs was confirmed with Job's method. Meanwhile, as supported by molecular modeling calculations, we suggested that phenyl group (C ring) of FIT molecule was included in the CDs cavity from the wide side. Moreover, the water solubility of FIT/CDs was successfully improved from 2.8\u2009mg/mL (in ethanol aqueous solution) to 4.5\u2009mg/mL (FIT/\u03b2-CD complex) and 7.8\u2009mg/mL (FIT/\u03b3-CD complex), and higher thermal stability results were shown by thermal analysis for those complexes. Notably, the inclusion complexes displayed almost two times higher cytotoxicity compared to free FIT against Hela and MCF-7 cells. These results suggested that FIT/CDs complexes could be potentially useful in food industry and healthcare area.",

Herein, a new library of disubstituted FCOEs bearing adjacent heteroatoms were synthesized and applied in ROMP. To address the issues associated with the handling of the reactive thienyl chloride intermediate, a two-step continuous flow method has been developed to prepare 5-thio-6-chlorocyclooctene compounds from abundant cyclooctadiene starting materials. These newly synthesized FCOE monomers were subsequently polymerized through ROMP, giving rise to a range of functionalized polymers with high molecular weights. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the thermal properties of these polymers could be fine-tuned by changing the functional groups in the FCOE monomers. We expect that this functionalization-polymerization strategy will enable the preparation of a range of polymeric materials with complex structures.",

        "abstract": "Strategies for switching polymerizations between \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d states offer new possibilities for materials design and fabrication. While switching of controlled radical polymerization has been achieve using light, applied voltage, allosteric effects, chemical reagents, pH, and mechanical force, it is still challenging to introduce multiple external switches using the same catalyst to achieve logic gating of controlled polymerization reactions. Herein, we report an easy-to-synthesize thermally responsive organo-/hydro-gel that features covalently bound 10-phenylphenothiazine (PTH). With this \u201cGel-PTH\u201d, we demonstrate switching of controlled radical polymerization reactions using temperature \u201cLOW\u201d/\u201cHIGH\u201d, light \u201cON\u201d/\u201cOFF\u201d, and catalyst presence \u201cIN\u201d/\u201cOUT\u201d.

Investigations such as MALDI-TOF analysis, chain extension, and \u201cON/OFF\u201d control experiments confirmed the fidelity of the polymer structure and reliability of this method.

This study aimed to evaluate the drug-excipient compatibility of binary mixtures (BMs) (1:1 BMs, w/w), initially by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and subsequently, by complementary techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) if there was any evidence of interaction. The samples were stored under accelerated stability conditions (40\u00a0\u00b0C at 75\u00a0% relative humidity). The DSC curves of estradiol and the BMs with excipients (corn starch, lactose, xanthan gum, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, dibasic calcium phosphate, and talc) were obtained. The results show that estradiol was compatible with all the selected excipients. XRPD and HPLC analysis were instrumental in interpreting the DSC results and excluding relevant pharmaceutical incompatibilities in all cases. Overall, the compatibility of the selected excipients with estradiol was successfully evaluated using a combination of thermal and spectroscopic methods, and the formulations developed using the compatible excipients were found to be stable.",

        "abstract": "In the course of time domain airborne electromagnetic exploration, induction electromotive force is produced by the movement of the receiver coil in the earth's magnetic field, which is the main noise source in AEM data because of its large amplitude. Coil motion noise covers mainly low frequency band. Though its amplitude will rapidly decreases with frequency increasing, it still contains higher frequency components than transmitting frequency. Therefore, the traditional high pass filter has certain limitation in dealing with coil motion noise. According to the airborne electromagnetic data characteristics, polynomial is used to approximate motion noise for each full waveform half cycle, and then Lagrange method is employed to solve polynomial coefficient of motion noise. The polynomial coefficients are calculated by matrix inverse and finally motion noise is subtracted from each half cycle electromagnetic data. Furthermore, polynomial approximation method is applied to the synthetic data contaminated by low frequency motion noise comparing with traditional high pass filter method. Simulation results indicated that, the polynomial approximation method shows more effective in dealing with coil motion noise of airborne electromagnetic data, which can increase the signal to noise ratio more than 40 dB.",

        "abstract": "Marine controlled-source electromagnetic method has become the research focus in subsea hydrocarbon exploration overseas.This paper studies the parameters of its survey system,which are important during instrument development and survey design.The simulations indicate whether in deep sea or in shallow sea,the system parameters affect the measurement results by the same way.The current of transmitter and the length of receiver antenna only affect the amplitude of electromagnetic signals,which is in direct proportion to them.The offset and the frequency of transmitter have remarkable effects on the measurement results.When they are too small or too big,no obvious hydrocarbon anomalies can be observed.So mid values should be allotted to them.The influences on the measurement results from the length and height of transmitter antenna and the height of receiver antenna are small.The hydrocarbon anomalies gradually become small with the increase of the three parameters.Since the values of these parameters are usually not big,their influences can be neglected.In shallow sea,both the transmitter antenna and the receiver antenna could be set close to the sea surface,where small antenna height is still kept.However,this distribution manner can not be used in deep sea.",

For the characteristics of transient signal, the transient electromagnetic receiver utilized a 12 bit A/D with high speed and 16 bit A/D with high resolution to record the transient electromagnetic signal in sequent stage. Double A/Ds technique solves contradiction between high sampling rate and large dynamic range, which is difficult for single A/D. The transient electromagnetic receiver has two parallel sampling channels with the highest sampling rate of 1 MS/s.

The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of various aspects of MRS for groundwater exploration in complex geophysical settings.. We report the recent researches, includes adaptive signal processing for mitigating electromagnetic noise, 2D/3D MRS methods for low-volume detection, forward modeling and field-data inversion under complex conditions, as well as joint uses of MRS and TEM methods in karst aquifers..

        "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) exhibits its potent antitumor activity via membrane receptors on cancer cells without deleterious side effects for normal tissue. However, as many other cancer types, breast cancer cells develop a resistance to TRAIL. In the present study, we reported that exposure to 3.0 mT static magnetic field (SMF) mediated the sensitization of breast cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This effect was significantly reduced by the forced expression of survivin, suggesting the sensitization was mediated at least in part through the inhibition of survivin expression. In addition, SMF alone or in combination with TRAIL induced a cell cycle arrest within the G2 /M phase, and the reduction in the survivin protein level was associated with the downregulated expression of Cdc2, a cyclin B-dependent kinase that is necessary for the entry into the M phase. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SMF promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Cdc2 and, subsequently, survivin. Of note, SMF did not sensitize untransformed human mammary epithelial cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, the combined treatment of SMF and TRAIL may offer an attractive strategy for safely treating resistant breast cancers.",

When binary pseudorandom coded signals are used as seismic vibrator drive signals, there are serious correlation noises in seismic response section, reducing the signal-noise ratio. The matched sweep method for seismic vibrator put forward in this paper utilizes sine carrier signal modulated by matched pseudorandom sequence pair as seismic vibrator drive signal to sweep and excite, getting two matched original seismic records. After the two matched original seismic records are decoded, they are stacked to the final integration decoded seismic section. There are indications from results of seismic numerical simulation that the method basically does not have side-lobe effect of the conventional Chirp sweep case, which has effectively avoided correlation noises in m-sequence coded sweeping cases, and the final integration decoded seismic section can compare favorably with shot assembly records of pulse sources.",

        "abstract": "The quality of electrocardiogram (ECG) is often compromised by baseline wandering, power line interference and muscle noises. This paper compares four wavelet transform (WT) algorithms and proposes a combined algorithm to remove noises from ECG signals. The combined algorithm generates higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) and lower distortion factor than the four individual algorithms. The combined algorithm adopts the WT decomposition at high-scale to restrict BW and wavelet transform modulus maximum to reduce the rest noises. We tested the proposed algorithm through MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The final results confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively eliminates noises and gives little distortion, and the filtered ECG waveforms can be used for clinic analysis and diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is one of the most widely used and the most effective methods in EOR enhancement for old oilfields and in low-permeability oilfield exploitation. So fracture monitoring is critical for oilfield exploration and exploitation. In terms of low resistivity and high polarizability of fracturing fluids in strata, this work adopts the joint method of borehole to surface resistivity and induced polarization to monitor the hydraulic fractures in the oilfield. Based on the mirror principle, the abnormal potentials of conduct current and polarized current are computed for any geometry of fractures via three-dimensional finite time difference. The fusion abnormal of double parameters is derived through non-equal weight fusion to improve the ability of anomaly identification. Simulations show the data fusion for double parameter electrical methods has the advantage of extracting anomalies. Based on the forward modeling, we developed the borehole-surface joint electrical instrument for fracture monitoring with double waveforms transmitter and time division multiplexing receiver. It achieves the common-mode rejection ratio of 110 dB and extracts weak abnormal signals effectively. The oilfield test in Fuxian proves the borehole-surface joint electrical instrument has better ability and higher resolution for hydraulic fracture monitoring. This consequently solves the problems encountered when fracturing is in oil reservoirs of low resitivity or in deep reservoirs. It can realize real-time monitoring of hydraulic fractures in oilfields.",

        "abstract": "Airship-based ground-airborne time domain electromagnetic system enjoys high depth of prospecting and spatial resolution, as well as outstanding detection efficiency and easy flight controlling. However, due to low-altitude flying is markedly affected by wind direction, air flow, landform, and the difference of temperature filed around ground surface, the front-fixed receiving coil would cut earth magnetic field, which results from changes of the altitude, track, and gesture of the airship, and causes electromagnetic and moving noises, baseline drift as well. The drawbacks mentioned above could lead to inferior resistivity image formation of electromagnetic data. Consequently, to investigate methods of removing noises of electromagnetic data is of vital importance to inversion explanation. With simultaneously occurred frequency band of valid electromagnetic data and part of the noise, traditional filter technique or noise-removing ways have their own limitations. Therefore, this study proposes a combined de-noising method, which adopts sym8 wavelet basis according to the characteristic of the electromagnetic data, corrects the baseline drift using estimation of high-level approximation by applying wavelet multi-resolution analysis, and suppresses other noises by five-level wavelet decomposition with MiniMaxi threshold and Hard shrinking function by applying wavelet threshold shrinkage theory. The combined de-noising method is validated by adopting the theoretical response and wild measured data based on the Anomaly Loop Model, respectively. The final results confirm that the proposed method eliminates noises effectively, which indicates it is applicable and effectual to ground-airborne time domain electromagnetic data.",

To solve this problem we propose to apply a phased-array vibrator, which can form a directional seismic wave. We have made numerical simulation of multi-track seismograms and computed reflected waves' SNR for combination and phased-array sources in a given horizontal stratified model. The result shows that the average SNR of reflected waves increases 1.54-9.90 dB respectively than the combination source when the 4, 8, 15 and 20-unit phased-array vibrators are used.

Applying this new source and cross-correlation detection technique, the seismic signals from horizontal layer medium were detected in different noise conditions. Comparing the seismic signal detected from single source with that from phased-array source, it is obvious that some reflected waves that can not be perceived in single source case are clear when phased-array source is used. Furthermore, quantitative calculation shows that compared with single source case, the SNR of reflected wave for 12-unit phased-array source increases by 19.25 dB averagely; and compared with 12-unit combination source, the SNR increases by 8.46 dB averagely. Simulation results prove the feasibility of using phased array source in detecting horizontal layer underground object with high SNR.",

This paper first analyzes the formation process of the total magnetic field during the switch-off time of transmitting current. We discuss the relation among the primary field, the secondary field and the total transient electromagnetic field and demonstrate the influence of the frequency feature and switch-off time of the receiver winding on the transient electromagnetic field. We then propose a method to remove the effect of the primary field from the total transient electromagnetic field. Using this method, we can obtain the transient electromagnetic fields of the early period during and after the current switch-off period. Using the ATTEM system developed by Jilin University, we conduct a fault investigation in the Yitong River area of Changchun. The field experiment results show a smaller blind zone of the transient electromagnetic method, a higher accuracy and resolution of shallow detection. It realizes survey implementation 4 meters below the earth' s surface and clear differentiation of low resistance anomalies. The overall results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

This is motivated by the fact that higher order cumulants of Gaussian processes vanish. In the present work we study the opposite problem, namely, detection and estimation in nonGaussion noise. We estimate cumulants of nonGaussion processes in the presence of unknown deterministic and/or Gaussion signals. Our approach is to augment existing second-order estimation methods using cumulants. Finally, we illustrate the hybrid strategy using field real data examples. The consistency of the results is very encouraging because the improved cumulant matching strategy we describe can be effectively used with a limited amount of data.",

In our country, because of historical affects, the need of geophysical instruments is increasing fast, and on the other hand, over relying on foreign instruments has heavily depressed the independent research and production of our own instruments. In such an unfavorable circumstance, our geophysical technologists keep to do their unremitting efforts and gain some notable achievements in the fields of gravity, magnetism, electricity, seismology and radioactivity. Based on this situation, the policy for the development of our geophysical instruments should be as follows: by combination of suitable importation and independent innovation and cooperation among research, production and application, setting up a studying and producing system with syncretism of multiple disciplines, unite criterion, high level of craftworks and good quality of services after sale; paying much attention to the development of the instruments for the application fields such as earth exploration, navigation geophysical detection, ocean exploration, geological hazard monitoring and national defence and so on; making use of special function of academic organizations, converging the powers of all circles, so as to form advanced geophysical techniques and instruments with our own independent intellectual property rights for the key fields of national construction.",

Due to several limitations, traditional measuring methods can not obtain the parameters of hydro-efflux hammer exactly and conveniently. A new non-contact measuring method was proposed, which measures the final velocity with linear Hall sensor, and then calculates impact energy and impact frequency. Furthermore, a parameter measurement instrument for hydro-efflux hammer was developed based on virtual instrument technology. The developing method and the key design ideas were given. Accurate test results were obtained from real measurements. The results show that the instrument and the measuring method are feasible.",

        "abstract": "MRS (Magnetic Resonance Sounding)) method is a direct method for underground water detecting which is easily disturbed by interferences according to its weak signal (nV). Time domain quantization methods require a good suppression of interferences for more accurate MRS signal parameter estimation. Of all interferences, power line harmonic interference is the most significant. To solve the problem, the paper analyzes the features of the MRS signal and the interference types and discusses two easily program integrated interference elimination method for MRS signal real time pretreatment. The stacking method based on random phase is an effective way to eliminate the interference but it requires massive stacks. Another method, Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) method is also proposed which is a more effective method especially in power line harmonic interference cancellation. Here an improved bidirection ANC method is proposed. The method can significantly eliminate the power line harmonic interference. Field test was carried out using JLMRS-I developed by Jilin University. With the method, the SNR of free induction decay (FID) records can be improved by 4 times with stacks 20 and nearly 100 times with stacks 160. The application of the bi-direction ANC method can improve the exploration efficiency under the same SNR of the FID records. \u00a92009 Crown.",

        "title": "A study on 2D magnetic resonance sounding with an array loop for groundwater exploration",
        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Sounding (MRS) is a geophysical method designed for direct groundwater exploration. Initially, MRS was developed for characterizing horizontally stratified aquifers. However, for the 2D/3D target whose size may be much smaller than the loop, the accuracy and the lateral resolution may not be sufficient. In this paper, possibility of 2D MRS with an array loop for groundwater exploration is studied firstly. Then, the expressions of the elliptically polarized excitation field induced by the transmitting loop and MRS response signal received by the array loop are derived. The 2D imaging of MRS initial amplitude and detection sensitivity measured with the array loop are numerically simulated, and are compared with the result from using the coincident loop. Conclusions are as follows; (1) 2D MRS measurement with the array loop can directly detect the horizontal position of water conduit in the subsurface, but requires higher excitation current and receiver sensitivity. (2) When the horizontal position, depth and section area of the water conduit vary, the detection sensitivity of 2D MRS measurement with the array loop is higher than that using the coincident loop, and the improvement of sensitivity is most obvious when horizontal position varying. (3) The sensitivity of 2D MRS measurement with the array loop detecting horizontal position varying decreases with increasing of the water conduit depth. (4) For shallow groundwater, the horizontal, vertical and section resolution determined by the instrumental noise level is 5 m, 4. 5 m, 8 m2, respectively. By increasing the number and turns of the receiver loop, improving excitation pulse moment and decreasing noise level, the existing instrument can be utilized to 2D MRS measurement. The theory and method presented in this paper will contribute to the application of 2D MRS with the array loop to fast detection of 2D/3D targets such as underground rivers, karstic conduits and dam seepages.",

        "abstract": "A new method for detecting risk of tunnel water-induced disasters using magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) is proposed in this letter. The method utilizes magnetic resonance signals that are generated directly from hydrogen protons to achieve the purpose of detecting risk of tunnel water-induced disasters directly and quantitatively. This letter evaluates the potential of this method based on a systematic study involving forward modeling, numerical experiments, and a large-scale physical model test. The relationship between the magnetic resonance signal response in the tunnel and the position and water content of water-bearing structures is obtained by the forward modeling. In the numerical examples, the inversion results are in agreement with the synthetic model. In the physical model test, the inversion results can accurately locate the water-bearing structure, and the water content linearly decreases with the water level of the water-bearing structure, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of predictions made based on the MRS data. These results demonstrate that tunnel MRS can be used to anticipate water-induced disasters.",

The effect of distortion in shallow survey was analyzed. If the total process of transient response and the waveform of switch-off current are recorded at the beginning of transmitter switch-off, and the position and resonance frequency of receiver sensor are known, the effect of distortion in early period of transient process can be numerical removed.

        "abstract": "Hydrogeological investigations were carried out in an arid area of Inner-Mongolia to determine the locations of future water supply resources. The first geophysical survey was conducted near Baiqi to identify favorable boreholes using magnetic resonance sounding (MRS). The yield capacities of 43 sites were investigated, and the extent of the potential groundwater storage was determined. Previous studies have indicated that a major tectonic structure may have a significant impact on the groundwater flow and well yield in the study area. Therefore, high-resolution seismic surveys were applied in the second stage of the investigation to determine the fault locations. After the regional identification, a major structure was investigated in detail to map the fracture patterns. Based on the assumption that the hydraulic conductivity of this formation is similar along the entire strike of the fracture, we proposed drilling a borehole (BQ3) in the zone. However, this well has a yield of only 0.8. L/s, falling short of the required flow rate of 3.0. L/s. Therefore, the objective of the final stage of exploration was to accurately define the attitude and extension of the aquifer and to select a more favorable borehole site that would meet the required water flow rate. The geophysical exploration was carried out using time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and MRS methods. The MRS results suggest optimal locations for water supply boreholes within the subsurface structures mapped by the TDEM inversion method. The data obtained by drilling and coring are in agreement with the predicted aquifer thickness from the TDEM data. Pumping tests indicate that the water discharge of borehole BQ4 was 3.5. L/s. Our results demonstrate that the delineation of the groundwater body using a combined application of three geophysical methods (the MRS, TDEM and 2D seismic methods) was successful. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V..",

        "abstract": "A grounded electrical source airborne transient electromagnetic (GREATEM) system on an airship enjoys high depth of prospecting and spatial resolution, as well as outstanding detection efficiency and easy flight control. However, the movement and swing of the front-fixed receiving coil can cause severe baseline drift, leading to inferior resistivity image formation. Consequently, the reduction of baseline drift of GREATEM is of vital importance to inversion explanation. To correct the baseline drift, a traditional interpolation method estimates the baseline 'envelope' using the linear interpolation between the calculated start and end points of all cycles, and obtains the corrected signal by subtracting the envelope from the original signal. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of the removal is found to be low. Considering the characteristics of the baseline drift in GREATEM data, this study proposes a wavelet-based method based on multi-resolution analysis. The optimal wavelet basis and decomposition levels are determined through the iterative comparison of trial and error. This application uses the sym8 wavelet with 10 decomposition levels, and obtains the approximation at level-10 as the baseline drift, then gets the corrected signal by removing the estimated baseline drift from the original signal. To examine the performance of our proposed method, we establish a dipping sheet model and calculate the theoretical response. Through simulations, we compare the signal-to-noise ratio, signal distortion, and processing speed of the wavelet-based method and those of the interpolation method. Simulation results show that the wavelet-based method outperforms the interpolation method. We also use field data to evaluate the methods, compare the depth section images of apparent resistivity using the original signal, the interpolation-corrected signal and the wavelet-corrected signal, respectively. The results confirm that our proposed wavelet-based method is an effective, practical method to remove the baseline drift of GREATEM signals and its performance is significantly superior to the interpolation method. \u00a9 ASEG 2013.",

        "abstract": "The marine controlled-source electromagnetic method (CSEM) is a new technology to detect subsea hydrocarbon reservoirs by electromagnetic fields of low frequency. Its prospecting capability is studied by numerical modeling in this paper. Based on 1D marine model, the electromagnetic responses on seafloor is calculated for different water depth environments and hydrocarbon reservoirs with various buried depth, thickness and resistivities. The biggest relative anomaly and corresponding absolute anomaly (i.e. amplitude difference) of electric fields for each buried depth, thickness and resistivity are plotted and the influence of these parameters on the electromagnetic anomaly is analyzed. The simulation results show that the marine controlled-source electromagnetic method has great performance in subsea hydrocarbon reservoirs exploration. Even the reservoirs of small thickness, small resistivity difference or large buried depth in shallow sea environment can lead to considerable electromagnetic anomalies. When other factors are same, the vertical impedance of oil layer decides the biggest electric anomaly. To achieve the optimal performance of marine CSEM, appropriate working frequency and receiver offset are necessary. The study results will provide useful references for the geophysical scheme design of future subsea hydrocarbon exploration.

The MRS-FID signal is an extremely weak signal with nV-level and it is often interfered by the various noises. Narrow-band filtering is an effective way to suppress noise and improve the SNR (signal to noise ratio). However, the bandwidth of narrow-band filtering is usually fixed, and the actual bandwidth of MRS-FID signal varies from place to place. Therefore, different places require different bandwidths for obtaining the better results. This paper proposed a new method, which can improve the narrow band filter performance by using bandwidth auto-matching. The final results show that the proposed method is better than the fixed bandwidth method.",

It has been widely used, not only in groundwater exploration and evaluation, but also in water-induced disasters (disasters caused by groundwater, such as dam leakage, landslides and seawater intrusion) forewarning. This paper discusses how to introduce SMRS into the detection and prediction of production safety in underground engineering and achieve MRS exploration in the extreme environments (narrow spaces including tunneling project and coal mining), which we call it Underground Magnetic Resonance Sounding (UMRS). To this goal, some challenges has to overcome when UMRS is carried out in underground engineering, including advance detection theories, detection by small coils in narrow space, adaptive signal processing for suppressing electromagnetic noise, quasi-whole space forward modeling and inversion strategies, the processing and inversion of quasi-full space 2D/3D disaster water detection data, as well as joint detection of MRS and TEM methods in complex geological environments like karst aquifers. We also briefly introduce superconducting detection technology and real-time detection technologies for shield and driving methods in underground engineering.",

        "abstract": "For the final goal of solving the problem about the feasibility and techniques of resistive target (e.g.hydrocarbon) exploration in the environment of China sea using CSEM,this paper studies the frequency-domain electromagnetic responses of a marine geological model with finite depth of seawater excited by a horizontal electric source,establishing theoretical base for 1D and 3D electromagnetic simulation.In the derivation of electric field formulas and magnetic field formulas,the Lorentz-gauged potential in each layer is solved first,and then the Coulomb-gauged potential in each layer is derived from the solution of Lorentz-gauged potential in the corresponding layer by the relationship between these two kinds of potentials.Although the electric fields and magnetic fields in all layers can be computed from the Lorentz-gauged potentials or the Coulomb-gauged potentials,the Coulomb-gauged potentials are advantageous in finite-element computation.The electromagnetic fields and potentials for an electric source with finite length can be obtained by integrating those for an electric dipole along the length of source.The electromagnetic field formulas in seawater both for a horizontal electric dipole and for an electric source with finite length are represented in this paper and they are used to simulate the distribution of electric fields and magnetic fields over seafloor in different water-depth environments.The effect of water depth on the electromagnetic anomalies of hydrocarbon buried in seafloor is discussed in the end.The results show that the intensity and shape of the electromagnetic anomalies markedly change with the decrease of water depth and only the E_x and E_z components reveal perceptible anomalies when seawater is very shallow,for example,50 m. At last,the electric-field anomalies for two well known oil fields in different water depth are calculated,which shows the good future of electric-source frequency-domain CSEM in seafloor exploration,even in shallow sea.The problems that need further study in the practical application of this method are also discussed in the last part of this paper.",

A insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is used in transient electromagnetic transmitter system to shorten turn-off time. The turn-off waveform is designed to approach ideal step function to eliminate the effect of nonzero turn-off and solve the conflict between strengthening transmitter and rapid switching. The experimental results indicate that shortening turn-off time can enhance resolution of transient electromagnetic for shallow subsurface sounding and reduce the blind zone of transient electromagnetic sounding.",

Using a 2D FDTD method, this study analyzes the characteristics and variation rules of grounded long wire source airborne electromagnetic responses, and the effect of flight altitude. A receiver is developed on an unmanned airship, using a 32 bit MCU with the Cortex-M3 processor, reducing electromagnetic noise by placing a fully differential amplifier in the front of the analog circuit, and recording multi-channel signals synchronously with 24-bit resolution. To achieve ground remote control, we establish a high-speed communication network through WiFi-Mesh connection based on multi-hop topology. To reduce noise, a method based on ICA is used according to the characteristics of the engine noise analysis. We have carried out two survey tests in a region of Nantong and a pastoral area in Inner Mongolia using the developed receiver on the unmanned airship, and compared the exploration results using the grounded long wire source airborne electromagnetic system, TEM, and MT system. The results indicate that the grounded long wire source airborne electromagnetic method is practical and effective. With the successful flight tests of the developed system, it can be used as a new approach for investigations in deserts, costal beaches, swamps and mountains.",

The basic principle and inversion method of MRS is research to determine the coil type and measurement mode for dam leakage problem. Field experiment of dam leakage detection was performed on Cuijiajie dam in Huanren, Liaoning Province, using JLMRS system developed by Jilin University. 15 points on the dam crest were measured with a 4-rurn square coil of 12.5 m side length for maximum depth 35 m. By data processing and inversing, the water content profile of the dam body in 2D is achieved. Furthermore, for eliminating the effect of upstream water, a correction method is used and the relative water content in 2D is updated. The interpretation results show that there are three leakage points (140 m, 180 m and 240 m away from the spillway, respectively) and two infiltration areas (rang of 100 m to 150 m and 170 m to 250 m) at depth of -20 m to -10 m inside Cuijiajie dam, which are gravel layer leakage. The measurement result is confirmed consistent with the engineering geology and downstream water percolation.",

With thin sheet model, this paper studies the detection resolution of the full-waveform TEM response induced by a trapezoid wave. An approximate method basing on eddy currents is used to estimate the mutual inductance of two coils at any position, and applied to compute the induced electromotive force of a slab model during switch-off and off time. Numerical results indicate that if minimum signal resolution of survey system is 5 nV/m2 in the case of conductive overburden, the detectable conductance range is 1~400 S during off time and 0.1~1000 S during switch-off time. When full-waveform method is adapted to the airborne TEM system, it could broaden the conductance resolution aperture of airborne TEM.",

        "title": "Statistical stacking and adaptive notch filter to remove high-level electromagnetic noise from MRS measurements",
        "abstract": "Traditionally, one of the major limitations for magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) measurement is that the weak signal generated by subsurface water molecules is prone to be disturbed by highlevel electromagnetic noise. In China, the power grid coverage is 94.6% and spiky noise and power-line harmonic noise are always present when utilizing MRS measurement in suburban areas or towns. In order to improve the performance of the MRS method, two new techniques, statistical stacking and adaptive notch filter, are introduced to remove spiky noise and power-line harmonic noise. Firstly, four stacking procedures are analysed to suppress the natural noise and spiky noise. It could be found that statistical stacking can be utilized in the areas with serious spiky noise and can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 4 to 7. Moreover, the stacking number is less than other stacking procedures and the measurement time may decrease by nearly 50% in some suburban areas or towns. Secondly, there are a variety of filtering procedures available to suppress power-line harmonic noise, which are all based on analogue or digital notch filtering. But nearly all of them may cause distortion. An adaptive notch filter is applied here to remove power-line harmonic noise because harmonic frequencies are away from and (or) close to the Larmor frequency, even when the frequency offset between them is zero. From simulation results, it could be noted that the signal can be recovered after adaptive notch filtering because it is not irretrievably distorted but proportionally attenuated. Thus, the amplitude attenuation can accurately be compensated. The effectiveness of the two techniques applied to MRS measurements is demonstrated by field testing with the prototype of the MRS system developed by Jilin University, China. The results show that the statistical stacking and adaptive notch filter are effective methods to remove high-level electro-magnetic noise from MRS measurements. \u00a9 2011 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Sounding (MRS) has received much attention of geophysicists due to its qualitative and quantitative features in detection of groundwater. In traditional studies, people are limited to one-dimensional of instruments and interpretation methods based on layering aquifer models, which makes well location difficult in complex geological contexts and small water bodies in non-uniform aquifers not easy to identify in inversion interpretation. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a two-dimensional MRS distributed detection strategy. It builds on the non-uniform property of the excitation field, defines a detection profile angle \u03b1, and deduces a MRS response kernel function of distributed receiver coil. By realizing the 2D forward calculation, we explore the relationship between angle variations and detection sensitivity. In addition, it is the first time that Occam inversion is used for two-dimensional data interpretation of MRS, and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) technique is accomplished. In the modeling calculation, the applicable scope of distributed MRS detection is estimated objectively by setting different positions of aquifers as well as the changes of environmental noise. Antecedent theory can promote instrument improvement. The research group successfully developed the MRS distributed detection system through designing distributed receiver unit, adjusting receiving coil number and the number of turns and setting amplifier adaptive parameters. This method can be used in groundwater evaluation. The results of this study can also provide a powerful scientific basis for positioning of fissure water, assessment of dam leakage water hazard and 3D accurate detection of karst aquifers.",

On the basis of closed anomaly loop electromagnetic response calculation, we study the relationship among decay curve, profile curve, the loop electrical properties and the geometric parameters, and design a field experimental plan. To test this plan, we do field experiment utilizing a crane near the DaEDao in Changchun, the final results show that the average absolute error of the single measured data is 0.48 mV, the system relative error is less than 1% , the flight altitude error is 0.4 m, and the horizontal offset error is 0.2 m. It is an accurate, fast, economical and feasible method to test and calibrate the AEM system by using closed anomaly loop placed on the ground.

The transient response characteristics of this antenna configuration on seafloor are analyzed,and are compared with those in terrestrial environment. By comparison of the transient responses for different seafloor conductivity,the resolving power of the central loop to seafloor conductivity is studied. The influence of seawater depth and configuration size on transient responses and resolving power is also discussed. The results show that the central loop has good resolving power to the conductive seafloor,but poor one to the resistive seafloor. In the deep sea with conductivity of 3.2 S/m,the central loop of 2 m radius can resolve the seafloor whose conductivity is not smaller than 0.1 S/m. Decreasing the water depth can improve the resolving power to resistive seafloor at late time,and increasing the configuration size can improve the resolving power to resistive seafloor at early time. However,the extent of improvement is limited.",

        "abstract": "Microseismic monitoring is one of the most critical technologies for hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas production. To detect events in an accurate and efficient way, there are two major challenges. One challenge is how to achieve high accuracy due to a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The other one is concerned with real-time data transmission. Taking these challenges into consideration, an edge-computing-based platform, namely Edge-to-Center LearnReduce, is presented in this work. The platform consists of a data center with many edge components. At the data center, a neural network model combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is designed and this model is trained by using previously obtained data. Once the model is fully trained, it is sent to edge components for events detection and data reduction. At each edge component, a probabilistic inference is added to the neural network model to improve its accuracy. Finally, the reduced data is delivered to the data center. Based on experiment results, a high detection accuracy (over 96%) with less transmitted data (about 90%) was achieved by using the proposed approach on a microseismic monitoring system. These results show that the platform can simultaneously improve the accuracy and efficiency of microseismic monitoring.",

The paper adopts the time-frequency cross-correlation (TFCC) algorithm based on wavelet transform that can detect the reflection waves from vibroseis seismic data and estimate time delays. In the algorithm, firstly the wavelet transform is carried out for channel data and sweeping signals, which results in time-frequency representation; then, the cross-correlation is carried out for time-frequency representation. The reflection waves are transformed into time-frequency correlated wavelet and raw channel data is transformed into formation section at the same time in computed results of time-frequency cross-correlation. Using TFCC and correlation algorithms for processing of same practical vibroseis seismic data showed that the former could better suppress noises and detect weak reflection signal distinctively.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, airborne time-domain electromagnetic (ATEM) data are inverted to derive the earth model by iteration. However, the data are often highly correlated among channels and consequently cause ill-posed and over-determined problems in the inversion. The correlation complicates the mapping relation between the ATEM data and the earth parameters and thus increases the inversion complexity. To obviate this, we adopt principal component analysis to transform ATEM data into orthogonal principal components (PCs) to reduce the correlations and the data dimensionality and simultaneously suppress the unrelated noise. In this paper, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to approach the PCs mapping relation with the earth model parameters, avoiding the calculation of Jacobian derivatives. The PC-based ANN algorithm is applied to synthetic data for layered models compared with data-based ANN for airborne time-domain electromagnetic inversion. The results demonstrate the PC-based ANN advantages of simpler network structure, less training steps, and better inversion results over data-based ANN, especially for contaminated data. Furthermore, the PC-based ANN algorithm effectiveness is examined by the inversion of the pseudo 2D model and comparison with data-based ANN and Zhody's methods. The results indicate that PC-based ANN inversion can achieve a better agreement with the true model and also proved that PC-based ANN is feasible to invert large ATEM datasets. \u00a9 2012 Editorial Office of Applied Geophysics and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "A set of coaxial resistive voltage dividers (RVDs) with serial\u2013parallel connection has been designed. A new method has also been proposed to calibrate phase angle errors of RVDs at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The method is mainly based on a special proportional relationship with the resistance and capacitance between two RVDs with identical structure, and the assumption is that the stray capacitance distribution is identical for both RVDs. The absolute phase angle error of an RVD can be derived from the phase difference between the two RVDs. The RVD with ratio of 100:1 consisting of 100-   $Omega $    resistive elements has been built and self-calibrated. After the self-calibration of phase angle errors of the RVDs, a buffer has been introduced to the output of the RVD to reduce external loading error for the practical application. Finally, the standard uncertainty in phase angle error of the 100:1 RVD with buffer consisting of 100-   $Omega $    resistive elements is within    $30~mu $   rad at 100 kHz.",

        "abstract": "Motion-induced noise (MIN) caused by the mechanical vibration of the air-core coil sensor (ACS) in the geomagnetic field is an important element of detection method in helicopter transient electromagnetic (TEM) systems. The MIN level heavily influences the detection result when its frequency range covers the TEM signal base frequency (25 Hz). To reduce the MIN, the frequencies between the MIN and TEM signals need to be separated. Accordingly, the mechanical vibration frequency of the ACS must be decreased to a level below 25 Hz. Hence, a cable parallel ACS (CPACS), consisting of the cable parallel structure (CPS) and ACS, is designed for the helicopter TEM system. The CPS is designed to change the natural frequency of the ACS based on the mechanical principle. From a simulation, the natural mechanical frequency range of the ACS is changed to lie within 1.89\u20133.67 Hz. Post CPACS fabrication tests show that the resulting ACS natural mechanical vibration frequency is approximately 3 Hz. Field experiments implemented to verify the electrical performance of the designed CPACS reveal a MIN frequency of about 2\u20133 Hz, substantially lower than 25 Hz. The MIN level is reduced from \u00b122 to \u00b11 nT/s, further distinguishing anomaly responses during the data collection. In summary, the implementation of the CPACS as the sensor of the TEM system drastically improves the noise reduction performance of the detecting instrument due to its contrivable electrical\u2013mechanical character.",

We take two shapes of the transmitter loop, square and rectangle, and two configurations of array receiver loop, edge-to-edge and half-overlapping, into account and the results show the rectangle loop provides high resolution below the whole array loop, while the square loop has high resolution only in the vicinal of the transmitter loop edges. On the other hand, the half-overlapping receiver loops have significantly higher resolution than the edge-to-edge configuration. Compare to the multi-offset coincident and separated loop, array loop not only provides the similar resolution inside of the transmitter loop, but also a wide lateral expansion outside by one measurement.",

        "abstract": "The multiple instrument calibrations of flying helicopter-borne time-domain electromagnetic method (HTEM) can eliminate the environmental time-varying effect on the system during flight. Using the bird calibration device to solve the problem that the wire-loop method can't achieve, we consider the bird model of HTEM with the concentric bucking loop, propose the bird device space models and the coil circuit models, and analyze the transmitter magnetic field distribution, the bucking loop's effect and the relationship between it and the receiving coil, the space information of the calibration device and its signal detecting method. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the bucking loop that losses 0.89% of the transmitting area can increase 44. 5 dB of the signal dynamic range. (2) The calibration device is levelly placed between the bucking loop and the transmitting coils. If it has more turns and greater radius and it is closer to the bucking loop, its signal response is stronger. (3) When the inductance of calibration coil becomes greater and its resistance is less, its exponential decay becomes slower. The signal detection time point is directly decided by damping character of receiver coil which has matching resistance. We do experiments about the calibration curve characters and the device coil displacement. The relative error about the time constant of the device characteristics is less than 1.3 % , which proves the validity of the coil circuit models and device space models. The proposed models and approaches are also applicable to the bird calibration device research about HTEM with the eccentric bucking loop and the known wire-loop static testing on the high resistance ground.",

For a 'oop target in free space, the vo'tage response is derived for waveforms of square, trapezoidal, half-sine and triangular shape. It is found that, for lower conductivity object, every waveform excites almost the same response during on-time and off-time, respectivy. Among afl waveforms, the maximum response is generated by a square pulse. For low signal to noise ratio (SNR) during off-time, square pulse is usually used for lower conductivity object detection. For higher conductivity object, response sharply decreased with the increase of the conductivity during off-time. WhUe the responses of hafl-sine and trianguhir shapes are constant with the increase of conductivity. So we concluded that half-sine and triangular shapes are suitable for on-time detection. By properly increasing the base frequency, high SNR and high space resokition can be obtained.",

        "abstract": "When ambient noise is strong, seismic data signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) might still be low even if combination vibrators are used. To solve this problem we proposed to apply a phased-array vibrator system (PAVS), which can form a directional seismic wave. In theory, 3-unit PAVS can make SNR of reflected waves increasing 6.53-9.54 dB than single vibrator, and 1.76-4.77dB than combination sources. In practice, field experiments were done with different sources in the same test field. The results show that a significant SNR improvement can be seen in reflected signals of PAVS than single source according to single shot records and horizontal stacking time sections. Of course, we also noticed that there is a little difference in time domain signals between seismic signals of PAVS and combination source. Furthermore, power spectrums of reflected wave signals are analyzed and we get some quantitative results: PAVS make SNR of reflected waves increasing 0.75-8.15 dB and 0.93-3.17dB at different traces respectively than single and combination sources. Mean SNR increases are 3.65dB and 2.02dB. It shows that the results from experiments are consistent with theoretical analysis. To evaluate PAVS and its effect on seismic signals, time sections from different sources were shown. It can be seen that directional illumination technology of PAVS is effective and superior to boost SNR of seismic signals than other routine sources.",

        "abstract": "The method of Magnetic Resonance Sounding (MRS) provides a new technology to determine subsurface water qualitatively and quantitatively, which has received much concern of geophysicists. The traditional inversion of MRS uses homogeneous half-space models and ignores effects of resistivity distribution on inversion results. Based on the MRS theory in the multi-layer earth model, we developed a new scheme for joint inversion of MRS data and Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) data. By correcting MRS inversion with resistivity in real time, the accuracy of inversion result was improved greatly. The Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) was applied. By adaptively adjusting the probability of crossover and mutation, AGA has not only avoided the premature convergence of GA but also has obtained the global optimal solution. Studies with synthetic data show that the MRS-TEM joint inversion scheme can obtain the aquifer structure accurately even 10% noise applied. Compared with the traditional MRS inversion scheme, the advantage of this new approach is obvious. By applying this method to filed data processing, and with the good inversion result, we have verified the the applicability of AGA and the practical significance of MRS-TEM joint inversion scheme.",

But in-situ oil yield analysis of oil shale can be achieved by the portable near infrared spectroscopy technique. There are different correlativities of NIR spectrum data formats and contents of sample components, and the different absorption specialities of sample components shows in different NIR spectral regions. So with the proportioning samples, the PLS modeling experiments were done by 3 formats (reflectance, absorbance and K-M function) and 4 regions of modeling spectrum, and the effect of NIR spectral format and region to the precision of PLS model for oil yield from oil shale was studied. The results show that the best data format is reflectance and the best modeling region is combination spectral range by PLS model method and proportioning samples. Therefore, the appropriate data format and the proper characteristic spectral region can increase the precision of PLS model for oil yield form oil shale.",

        "abstract": "With increasing scarcity of energy resources in the world, oil shale exploration and development have gradually being on the agenda as an important alternative energy of oil-gas resource. To study the performance of mini vibrators in the oil shale, the experiments of four mini vibrators carried out at Nong'an oil shale in 2011. The Mini vibrators are as follows: PHVS-500 electromagnetic vibrator, rammer source with internal-combustion engine, VIBSIST-50 vibrator and pulse coding vibrator. The seismic observation system used in the experiment is 428XL seismograph produced by Sercel company of French. Comparing the superimposed results of the four mini vibrators, In-phase reflection axises are clear within 200 ms on the seimic profiles of four kinds of vibrators; between 200ms and 300ms, two clear reflection layers can be seen from PHVS-500 and impact rammer source, the results are not obvious from VIBSIST-50 and pulse coding vibrator; over 300 ms, the in-phase reflection axises are not exactly clear for all kinds of vibrators, excepting that PHVS-500 have relatively continuous in-phase reflection axises between 300 ms and 400ms, and the result of PHVS-500 is consistent with the depth of the oil shale that the drilling data shows. So we can see that the four mini vibrators are able to better reflect the underground information from single shot records and seismic reflection profiles, indicating that mini vibrators are feasible for shallow oil shale exploration. PHVS-500 has relatively higher signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, and larger exploration depth. The result of combined rammer source is better than single rammer source. VIBSIST-50 is fit for the shallow oil shale. Pulse coding vibrator is weaker in signal-to-noise ratio, resolution and exploration depth.",

A insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is used in transient electromagnetic transmitter system to shorten turn-off time. The turn-off waveform is designed to approach ideal step function to eliminate the effect of nonzero turn-off and solve the conflict between strengthening transmitter and rapid switching.

Even if treated by denoise methods, the spectra can not meet the requirement of NIR analysis. So the equivalent spectrum measure method was researched. Based on the intensity of the reflected or transmitted signal by the sample under the traditional measure conditions, the light current of the spectrometer was enlarged, and then the signal of the measured sample increased; the reflected or transmitted light of the measure reference was reduced to avoid the signal of the measure reference over range. Moreover the equivalent spectrum of the sample was calculated in order to make it identical with the spectrum measured by traditional method. Thus the NIR spectral SNR was improved. The results of theory analysis and experiments show that if the light signal of the spectrometer was properly increased according to the reflected or transmitted signal of the low reflectivity or transmisivity sample, the equivalent spectrum was the same as the spectrum measured by traditional method and its SNR was improved.",

The ATTEM consists of two units: transmitter and receiver. The transmitter unit transmits a bipolar pulse current as excitation source, and records the turn-off current waveform through a sampling resistor connecting with transmitting bridges in series. If the configuration and position of transmitter loop are known, the primary field at receiving site can be calculated using BiotSavart law, and then its response in turn-off period can be numerically removed from the total response recorded by receiver. The receiver recodes total response when transmitting current start to switch off. A 12-bit A/D with sampling interval of 0.1 us records early stage of transient response and a 16-bit A/D with sampling interval of 5 us based on the floating amplification records middle and later stages of transient response. Double A/Ds sampling in sequential stages enhances the dynamic range of recording and the resolution of subsurface survey. Both test experiment result and field experiment result indicated that the ATTEM with the algorithm for numerically removing turn-off response enhanced the capability and resolution of subsurface survey.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, airborne time-domain electromagnetic (ATEM) data are inverted to derive the earth model by iteration. However, the data are often highly correlated among channels and consequently cause ill-posed and over-determined problems in the inversion. The correlation complicates the mapping relation between the ATEM data and the earth parameters and thus increases the inversion complexity. To obviate this, we adopt principal component analysis to transform ATEM data into orthogonal principal components (PCs) to reduce the correlations and the data dimensionality and simultaneously suppress the unrelated noise. In this paper, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to approach the PCs mapping relation with the earth model parameters, avoiding the calculation of Jacobian derivatives. The PC-based ANN algorithm is applied to synthetic data for layered models compared with data-based ANN for airborne time-domain electromagnetic inversion. The results demonstrate the PC-based ANN advantages of simpler network structure, less training steps, and better inversion results over data-based ANN, especially for contaminated data. Furthermore, the PC-based ANN algorithm effectiveness is examined by the inversion of the pseudo 2D model and comparison with data-based ANN and Zhody\u2019s methods. The results indicate that PC-based ANN inversion can achieve a better agreement with the true model and also proved that PC-based ANN is feasible to invert large ATEM datasets.",

To reduce the high computational burden of ML method and make it more suitable to engineering applications, we apply the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to maximize the likelihood function for DOA estimation. As a recently proposed bio-inspired computing algorithm, ABC algorithm is originally used to optimize multivariable functions by imitating the behavior of bee colony finding excellent nectar sources in the nature environment. It offers an excellent alternative to the conventional methods in ML-DOA estimation. The performance of ABC-based ML and other popular meta-heuristic-based ML methods for DOA estimation are compared for various scenarios of convergence, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and number of iterations. The computation loads of ABC-based ML and the conventional ML methods for DOA estimation are also investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ABC based method is more efficient in computation and statistical performance than other ML-based DOA estimation methods. \u00a9 2013 Jilin University.",

        "abstract": "Smooth inversion and block inversion are two main methods for surface magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) at present, which can construct water content and average effective pore size of aquifer through initial amplitudes and mean relaxation times, respectively. However, these inversion methods are limited in porous geological environment and in some case the interface of aquifers can not be portrayed clearly due to the loss of valid information during mono-exponential fitting. Aiming at these problems, we studied multi-exponential inversion method, which is found to solve inversion problem on the basis of MRS signal inherent multi-exponential behavior, by taking the entire MRS signal datasets into account in this paper. The multi-exponential MRS inversion of porous geological environment was realized through decomposing the relaxation time, deducing a new magnetic resonance forward kernel function and then calculating the functional minimum equation, which directly estimates the partial water content distribution and thus provides both the water content and relaxation time depth distribution. In order to get the fast and stable result, layered inversion model is referenced and the optimized inversion is proposed based on inequality constrain of the trust region algorithm. The inversion examples for synthetic data and field data from Baicheng city Sifangtuozi show that this method is better than smooth inversion and block inversion. We can get more accurate water content distribution and depict porous geological structure with high efficiency of inversion calculation. This paper confirms that the inversion has properties of accuracy, applicability and extensibility, which provide a new thought and method for surface magnetic resonance sounding.",

Based on the forward modeling of the fixed-wing time-domain electromagnetic, this paper suggests the rotation matrix of the transmitter and receiver coil according to the attitude variation algorithm, and obtains the swing Green's tensor by using the relative position between transmitter loop and receiver coils. Then the expression of three-component electromagnetic response with arbitrary attitude and swing angle is derived. The electromagnetic response in respect to the bird rotation and swing is studied. The simulation results indicate that the pitch of the transmitter and receiver coil and the in-line swing have the greatest influence on the electromagnetic response. Therefore, the variation of the electromagnetic response when the in-line swing angle and the pitch of the transmitter and receiver coil coexist is analyzed. On this basis, the relationship between the response coefficient and earth conductivity is discussed. Meanwhile, the correction of attitude and bird swing of the fixed-wing airborne electromagnetic system is conducted. The inversion results of a quasi-two-dimensional layered earth model show that the accuracy after correction is enhanced by 33.1%.",

In particular, we consider single-input/single-output nonlinear system, whose output has known, but otherwise arbitrary relative degree. This includes systems with both parameter uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. The result is achieved by extending the universal function approximation property of parameterized neural networks to model unknown system dynamics from input/output data. The network weight adaptation rule is derived from Lyapunov function analysis, and guarantees that the adapted weight errors and the tracking error are bounded. Based on the design of adaptive neural network control, a practical application to the Vibroseis system has been achieved.",

        "abstract": "The amplitude and relaxation time T2 of magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) signal are directly related with water content and pore size of aquifers. Average T2, denoted by T2 *, is often used to describe the decay characteristic of MRS signal. However, in the case of porous media rock, pore size should be described by T2 spectrum of MRS signal. To obtain the spectrum and estimate the initial amplitude more accurately, we studied multi-exponential decomposition method based on inequality constraint in this paper. Numerical results show that extending signal length helps the accuracy of T2 spectrum estimation. With traditional method, average relative error is less than 5% when SNR is greater than 30 dB. With our modified algorithm, a SNR about 10 dB could lead to the same error. meanwhile, the error of the estimated amplitude is reduced by at least 1/3. It can be concluded that multi-exponential decomposition method could obtain T2 spectrum of MRS signal, and adding regularization and weighted correction to the method could improve the accuracy of T2 spectrum inversion. Comparing to mono-exponential fitting, multi-exponential inversion can estimate the initial amplitude more accurately.",

Due to the conditions of transportation and instrument preparation time, the work efficiency of the existing system has not obvious advantage to detect the widespread shallow groundwater. In view of the characteristics, a way to constitute MRS system for shallow groundwater exploration is reported in this paper. The main factors which influence the magnetic resonance detection ability are analyzed and the technical specifications of the key part are defined. On the basis of that, a portable MRS system for shallow groundwater exploration is developed.

Here, the construction of a magnetic full-tensor gradiometer is described, which utilizes four fluxgates arranged on a planar cross structure, and a single, triaxial, spherical feedback coil assembly. In this arrangement, one of the fluxgates is used as a reference, controlling the currents through the feedback coils. Since the fluxgates are working in the near-zero magnetic field environment, the magnetic tensor gradiometer is stable and of an improved accuracy. This design avoids the crosstalk normally caused by individual feedback coils for each fluxgate, and reduces the orthogonality and orientation errors. Moreover, the calibration parameters can be directly inferred using the spherical feedback coil. The measured gradient tensor magnitude can reach 0.52 nT/m/Hz(1/2) @ 1 Hz in unshielded laboratory conditions, while exhibiting good noise immunity. The functionality of the system is verified by locating a small, single, permanent, and dipole magnet in space. The gradiometer is compact, while employing global feedback, and therefore it is especially suitable for deployment on space-constrained moving platforms.",

        "title": "Transmitting oscillation suppression of low-Tc SQUID TEM system based on RC serial and multi-parallel capacity snubber circuit",
        "abstract": "A low-temperature superconducting quantum interference device (low-Tc SQUID) can improve the depth of exploration. However, a low-Tc SQUID may lose its lock owing to oscillations in the current or the occurrence of spikes when the transmitter is switched off. If a low-Tc SQUID loses its lock, it becomes impossible for the low-Tc SQUID TEM system to function normally and stably for a long period of time. This hinders the practical use of the system. In field experiments, the transmitting current is accurately measured, the voltage overshoot and current spike data are recorded, and the gradient of the primary magnetic field at the center of the transmitting loop is calculated. After analyzing the results of field experiments, it was found that when the gradient of the primary magnetic field far exceeds the slew rate of a low-Tc SQUID, the low-Tc SQUID loses its lock. Based on the mechanisms of the transmitting oscillation, an RC serial and multi-parallel capacity snubber circuit used to suppress such oscillation is proposed. The results of simulation and field experiments show that, when using a 100 m\u00d7100 m transmitting loop, the gradient of the primary magnetic field is suppressed from 101.4 to 2.4 mT/s with a transmitting current of 40 A, and from 29.6 to 1.4 mT/s with a transmitting current of 20 A. Therefore, it can be concluded that the gradient of the primary magnetic field is below the slew rate of a low-Tc SQUID after adopting the proposed RC serial and multi-parallel capacity snubber circuit. In conclusion, the technique proposed in this paper solves the problem of a lost lock of a low-Tc SQUID, ensuring that the low-Tc SQUID TEM system functions stably for a long period of time, and providing technical assurance for ground TEM exploration at an additional depth.",

Airborne electromagnetic response data obtained by airborne electromagnetic method presents changing trend of attenuation exponential summation, and which has abundant but redundant information character. In order to fast reconstructing airborne electromagnetic response data, Prony Method and Matrix Pencil Method are applied and eigenvector extraction and reconstruction precision of these two methods are comparatively analyzed in this paper. Research results indicate that, eigenvectors extracted by these two methods reflect intrinsic attribution of underground geological body. To non-noise airborne electromagnetic response data, better reconstruction precision realized by these two methods is presented. To including noise airborne electromagnetic response data, when signal to noise ratio gradually decreases from 20 to 0 dB, reconstruction precision of Prony Method rapidly descends, but that of Matrix Pencil Method merely slight fluctuates. Therefore, the latter is more effective to reconstruct airborne electromagnetic response data in complex electromagnetic environment. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

        "abstract": "When noise in the field is strong, it's difficult to obtain high SNR seismic data with single or combination vibrator. So phased-array vibrator system (PAVS), which can form directional seismic beam, was developed. Because the orientation of the directional seismic wave is dependent on the time delay, the time delay is a dominant factor for PAVS to boost SNR of reflected signals. 3-unit PAVS is able to improve SNR by 6. 53 -9. 54 dB based on theoretical analysis. Field seismic data were obtained for time delays 0, 0. 802, 0. 384, 0. 241, 0. 174, and 0. 123 ms respectively. Using the raw data with different time delays, the power spectrums of reflected seismic signals were calculated, and then quantitative SNR improvement is obtained. Compared to the case of single source, SNR increased by 3. 3150,8. 0150,6. 0547,5. 0278,4. 5383,and 4.0364 dB, respectively. Compared to the case of combination source, SNR increased by 0, 4.7000, 2.7397, 1.7128, 1.2233,and 0.7214 dB, respectively. On the basis of theoretical analysis and the results of field experiment, it concludes that directional seismic beam technique is useful to SNR improvement, SNR varies with time delay, proper time delay can raise SNR of reflected signals significantly.",

        "abstract": "To meet the demands of sophisticated exploration of deep mineral resources in Deep Exploration Projects of China,seismic controlled source technology is an essential technology.Seismic resolution ratio of single vibrator and combination are not enough in the process of portable vibrator applied to mine exploration.Based on Phased-Array Vibrator System(PAVS),the paper adopts the finite-difference method to carry out numerical simulation of wave propagation and the response of detector in different two-dimensional medium models.We have made numerical simulation of the single vibrator,0 ms and 1.33 ms 9-unit phased-array in models of homogeneous,multi-layered and irregular mining,respectively.The results are as follows: PAVS produce directional seismic wave in the homogenous model.The main beam direction is 90\u00b0 and 70.4\u00b0 for time delay parameters of 0 ms and 1.33 ms.In the model of layered medium,the direction of main beam of 0 ms PAVS is vertical and does not change.Seismic waves of 1.33 ms PAVS are still directional in multi-layered media.When the wave velocity changed,bending waves occur.Directions of seismic waves changed from 70.4\u00b0 to 68.5\u00b0,66.0\u00b0,63.7\u00b0,and 61.1\u00b0.In irregular mining model,directions of seismic waves of 1.33 ms PAVS are 70.4\u00b0 in first floor,65.4\u00b0 in surrounding rock and 63.1\u00b0 within ore mineral body.In layered model,1.33 ms and 0 ms PAVS increases the SNR by 14.1 dB and 10.2 dB compared with the single vibrator.In tilt mining model,1.33 ms and 0 ms PAVS increases the SNR by 18.9 dB and 14.9 dB compared with the single.Thus we get a conclusion that seismic waves of PAVS are directional in complex media,although the direction of the beam will deflect in different media.For a variety of time delay parameters,PAVS have the ability to improve the SNR of seismic data.According to the numerical simulation results,PAVS can effectively improve the quality of seismic data in ore cluster area.",

In order to accommodate the situation that Dataflow Visual Programming Languages (DFVPLs) are more and more popular, an automated refactoring tool for DFVPL was proposed. DFVPL was divided into two layers---visual layer and dataflow layer. Two layers mutually evolved, which ensured correctness of visual elements and dataflow semantic during refactoring. Some algorithms like middle graph generation; terminal auto-generation and terminal auto-modification were proposed to implement the changes of two layers. This tool has been proved correct and efficient by some refactoring instances. In addition, we discussed some famous DFVPL like LabVIEW to expose lacking of automated refactoring tool forced refactoring by hand to be time-consuming and error-prone.",

The method is not involved in the measurement of the magnetic field vector greatly affected by the geomagnetic field. Simultaneously, it is very suitable for underground and underwater exploration such as the exploration of unexploded ordnance. But, it has asphericity errors, which can make the azimuth errors of up to 5\u00b0. In addition, it is tightly coupled with the magnetic properties of the target. Thus, we proposed an iterative method to correct the asphericity errors. In this method, beginning with the results of the STAR method, the defective parameters obtained by the sensor structure were used to rapidly correct the localization errors and enhance the properties of real-time localization. The relative errors of the components of bearing vector were reduced by a factor of 7, and they were not influenced by the magnetic properties of the target.",

        "abstract": "According to the correlated characteristic of remotely sensed multispectral images (RSMI) in the spectral and spatial domains, an effective and lossy YCrCb+IWT compression algorithm is proposed. The algorithm combines YCrCb transform with integer wavelet transform (IWT) to compress data, and data redundance of spectral and spatial domains is removed respectively. The important degree of the each subband is determined according to the energy of the each subband. Furthermore, each subband is quantified using adaptive threshold according to their important degree, then fixed bit-plane coding and Run Length Encoding are individually used to the quantified data of every subband and important graph. When implementing compression algorithm, in order to ensure better quality of reconstructed image, the compression with little distortion is utilized for luminance information Y. Simultaneously, in order to obtain higher compression ratio, the compression with biggish distortion is carried out for chrominance information Cr and Cb. The simulation experiment indicates that this algorithm can receive good compression performance of average CR\u2265 7 and average PSNR\u2265 33dB for RSMI of different content and texture. In addition, the algorithm requires small storage and is easy to be realized in hardware, so it is suitable for space-borne application.",

However, the existing microtremor exploration equipment has been unable to satisfy the requirements of the MSM, which suffers from low data accuracy, long measurement time, and blind acquisition. In this study, we combined a 2 Hz moving coil geophone with advanced acquisition systems to develop a new integrated energy-efficient wireless sensor node for microtremor exploration. A high-precision AD chip and noise matching technology are used to develop a low-noise design for the sensor node. Dynamic frequency selection technology (DFS) and dynamic power management technology (DPM) are used to design an energy-efficient mode. The data quality monitoring system solves the closed technical flaws between the acquisition systems and the control center via 4G wireless monitoring technologies. According to the results of a series of in situ tests and field measurements, the noise level of the system was 0.7 \u03bcV@500 Hz with 0 dB attenuation and 220 mW power consumption of the system in the autonomous data acquisition mode. Therefore, it provides substantial support for the effective data acquisition over long measurement durations in microtremor exploration processes. The applicability of the system is evaluated using field data, according to which the integrated energy-efficient wireless sensor node is convenient and effective for MSM.",

With this way, it was able to increase SNR of seismic signals efficiently. Because SNR is the more important factor to resolution ratio than signal bandwidth when S/N\u226a1. So it was a good method to improve resolution ratio. In order to detect the seismic signal from phased array vibroseis, it applied the correlation technique and defined the reference signal. According to the simulation results, correlation is valid for phased array seismic signal. With techniques of four-unit phased array vibroseis and correlation detection method, the SNR of seismic signal increased 12.04 dB and resolution ratio improved 7.15 times than single vibroseis method. It concluded that correlation is a appropriate signal detection in phased array of vibroseis system.",

The automatic wiring method was designed by integrating wiring distance, logical relation, type matching, etc. and using logical sequence of generated virtual instrument software. This design was implemented independently in the DFVPL, LabScene which can be used to develop virtual instruments and to be a reference for automatic wiring design of DFVPL in other domain.",

Even if treated by denoise methods, the spectra can not meet the requirement of NIR analysis. So the equivalent spectrum measure method was researched. Based on the intensity of the reflected or transmitted signal by the sample under the traditional measure conditions, the light current of the spectrometer was enlarged, and then the signal of the measured sample increased; the reflected or transmitted light of the measure reference was reduced to avoid the signal of the measure reference over range. Moreover the equivalent spectrum of the sample was calculated in order to make it identical with the spectrum measured by traditional method. Thus the NIR spectral SNR was improved. The results of theory analysis and experiments show that if the light signal of the spectrometer was properly increased according to the reflected or transmitted signal of the low reflectivity or transmisivity sample, the equivalent spectrum was the same as the spectrum measured by traditional method and its SNR was improved.",

        "title": "Unified physical mechanism of frequency-domain controlled-source electromagnetic exploration on land and in ocean",
        "abstract": "The frequency-domain controlled-source electromagnetic method (FDCSEM) has played an important role in the terrestrial and oceanic exploration. However, the measuring manners and the detecting abilities in two kinds of environment are much different. This paper analyses the electromagnetic theories of the FDCSEM exploration on land and in ocean, simulates the electromagnetic responses in the two cases based on a united physical and mathematical model, and studies the physical mechanism leading to these differences. In this study, the relationship between the propagation paths and the detecting ability is illuminated and the way to improve the detecting ability of FDCSEM is brought forward. In terrestrial exploration, FDCSEM widely adopts the measuring manner of controlled-source audio-frequency magnetotelluric method (CSAMT), which records the electromagnetic fields in the far zone in the broadside direction of an electric dipole source. This manner utilizes the airwave (i.e. the Earth surface wave) and takes the stratum wave as interference. It is sensitive to the conductive target but insensitive to the resistive one. In oceanic exploration, FDCSEM usually adopts the measuring manner of marine controlled-source electromagnetic method (MCSEM), which records the electromagnetic fields, commonly the horizontal electric fields, in the in-line direction of the electric dipole source. This manner utilizes the stratum wave (i.e. the seafloor wave and the guided wave in resistive targets) and takes the airwave as interference. It is sensitive to the resistive target but relatively insensitive to the conductive one. The numerical simulation shows that both the airwave and the stratum wave contribute to the FDCSEM exploration. United utilization of them will enhance the anomalies of targets and congregate the advantages of CSAMT and MCSEM theories. At different azimuth and different offset, the contribution of the airwave and the stratum wave to electromagnetic anomaly is different. Observation at moderate offset in the in-line direction is the best choice for the exploration of resistive targets, no matter the environment is land or shallow sea. It is also the best choice for the exploration of conductive targets in terrestrial environment. As for the conductive targets in shallow sea, observation at moderate offset in the broadside direction is better. Synthetic and felicitous utilization of the airwave and the stratum wave will optimize the performance of FDCSEM. \u00a9 The Authors 2013.

Electromagnetic interference peak can be better suppressed by distributing the energy focused on the switching frequency and its harmonious frequencies to more frequencies. To achieve the requirement of switching power supply application, the relationship of output average frequency and input, and the mechanism of electromagnetic interference suppression are given in the further analysis of the sigma-delta modulation. To overcome the deficiencies of the sigma-delta modulation used in switching power supply, the improved sigma-delta modulation is proposed. The m and inverse m pseudo-random sequence are used for the realization of the random frequency generator and the random noise generator in improved sigma-delta modulation. Experiment results indicate that the electromagnetic interference peak of improved sigma-delta modulation is 10 dB lower than sigma-delta modulation, and improved sigma-delta modulation has better electromagnetic interference peak suppress effect.

According to the curves characteristics, the effects of geologic parameters on CSAMT resolution were discussed, and the way how to improve the electromagnetic response was studied in order to resolve the low-resistivity layer actually. The results show that there exists an optimal transmitting frequency for each model. The low-resistivity layer can be resolved when the resistivity rate of overlay and low-resistivity layer is greater than 2. When the optimal frequency is adopted as the minimum transmitting frequency, the electromagnetic field value can be increased by 1.5 power of the frequency, which solved the problem that the electric response values are too weak (nV) to be resolved by the receiver.",

The transient response characteristics of this antenna configuration on seafloor are analyzed, and are compared with those in terrestrial environment. By comparison of the transient responses for different seafloor conductivity, the resolving power of the central loop to seafloor conductivity is studied. The influence of seawater depth and configuration size on transient responses and resolving power is also discussed. The results show that the central loop has good resolving power to the conductive seafloor, but poor one to the resistive seafloor. In the deep sea with conductivity of 3.2 S/m, the central loop of 2 m radius can resolve the seafloor whose conductivity is not smaller than 0.1 S/m. Decreasing the water depth can improve the resolving power to resistive seafloor at late time, and increasing the configuration size can improve the resolving power to resistive seafloor at early time.

        "abstract": "Marine controlled source electromagnetic (MCSEM) detection uses the relationship between the electric or magnetic field in sea water and the conductivity of seabed to obtain the media information of seabed, so as to study the submarine internal composition and structure. This paper presents a method to calculate the time domain electromagnetic response by frequency domain electromagnetic response, and analyzes the influence of off-time on the response of time-domain electromagnetic detection of marine controlled source with central loop device by simulation. The results show that the off-time of the transmitter current of time-domain controlled source electromagnetic detection not only influences the amplitude of the early received signals, but also affects the resolving power to the media in the shallow seabed.

Several types of virtual instrument developing software are available for the virtual instrument development and parts of them have great influence in the instrument science field. However, only a limited number of inexperienced or previous untrained people are able to well utilize them. Part of the limitation stems from the difficulty in learning how to use them and part of from the demand of software developing expertise background or hardware design abilities. Therefore, user friendliness of virtual instrument software is needed for a great number of people who are without expertise background or hardware design abilities. There are a number of features in the software described in this article would server to meet the need, such as requirement-driven idea from human-computer interface implementation aspect helped step obstacles encountered by users with limited experience. An experimental interface design has been developed to use an advanced object-oriented development environment, thus allowing a great deal of flexibility in implementing changes and adding new features in order to provide a friendliness operation interface to actual users.",

        "abstract": "Based on of the whole-spatial characteristics of underground exploration, the quasi-whole space detection model was proposed for the first time, the quasi-whole space response kernel function of MRS was derived. The effect of the hollowed out area of the tunnel in the calculation result is eliminated effectively and MRS forward calculation accuracy is improved. Meanwhile, with the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) inversion method, the nonlinear inversion of magnetic resonance data of the underground quasi-whole space model is fulfilled. In the theoretical data, contracting the inversion results of ground half space with the underground space, quasi-whole space model can be more accurate in the inversion of underground disaster water's position and content, and a good inversion result even under the condition of containing 10% noise is gained. Based on the theoretical research and combining with MRS field testing of Zeya Tunnel of Jin Wen Railway, the water-bearing structure hidden in the tunneling tunnel face was explained, and the consistency of the detecting results comparatively was analyzed. The results show that the whole space exploration model combining SQP inversion algorithm can give the position of underground disaster water and water-bearing level accurately, and the prediction of groundwater harm accurately is achieved to lay a theoretical foundation for MRS detection of the tunnel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The ground electrical source airborne transient electromagnetic system (GREATEM) on an unmanned aircraft enjoys considerable prospecting depth, lateral resolution and detection efficiency, etc. In recent years it has become an important technical means of rapid resources exploration. However, GREATEM data are extremely vulnerable to stationary white noise and non-stationary electromagnetic noise (sferics noise, aircraft engine noise and other human electromagnetic noises). These noises will cause degradation of the imaging quality for data interpretation. Based on the characteristics of the GREATEM data and major noises, we propose a de-noising algorithm utilizing wavelet threshold method and exponential adaptive window width-fitting. Firstly, the white noise is filtered in the measured data using the wavelet threshold method. Then, the data are segmented using data window whose step length is even logarithmic intervals. The data polluted by electromagnetic noise are identified within each window based on the discriminating principle of energy detection, and the attenuation characteristics of the data slope are extracted. Eventually, an exponential fitting algorithm is adopted to fit the attenuation curve of each window, and the data polluted by non-stationary electromagnetic noise are replaced with their fitting results. Thus the non-stationary electromagnetic noise can be effectively removed. The proposed algorithm is verified by the synthetic and real GREATEM signals. The results show that in GREATEM signal, stationary white noise and non-stationary electromagnetic noise can be effectively filtered using the wavelet threshold-exponential adaptive window width-fitting algorithm, which enhances the imaging quality.",

        "abstract": "The grounded electrical source airborne transient electromagnetic (GREATEM) system, which uses a grounded electrical transmitter and an aircraft for the receiver, offers deep exploration capability and detection efficiency. However, GREATEM field data usually includes mixed varied noises (white noise, sferics noise and human noise), which make identifying the exponential decaying signal too difficult. Traditional filtering methods mainly focus on suppressing specific noise types, which may cause the distortion of GREATEM signal, especially when the signal is affected by high residual sferics noise. This paper presents an exponential fitting-adaptive Kalman filter (EF-AKF) to remove mixed electromagnetic noises, while preserving the signal characteristics. The EF-AKF consists of an exponential fitting procedure and an adaptive scalar Kalman filter (SKF). The adaptive SKF uses the exponential fitting results in the weighting coefficients calculation. The EF-AKF is verified on an analytical three-layer model. It is compared with the SKF and wavelet threshold-exponential adaptive window width-fitting denoising algorithm (WEF) in synthetic data. The results showed that the EF-AKF outperformed the other methods in the noise reduction of GREATEM data. The EF-AKF is also tested on a synthetic quasi-2D earth model and applied to GREATEM field data in Huaide, Jilin province, China. Application of the EF-AKF allowed considerable improvement of the quality of the GREATEM field data.",

        "abstract": "This research applied a numerical marine model ECOM-si(estuarine coastal ocean model-semi-implicit),coupling a real-time computational module of solar radiation intensity and sea surface heat flux,to evaluate effects of thermal water discharged from two coastal power plants(Guohua power plant and Wusha Mountain power plant) of the marine ranching zone in Xiangshan Bay.Affected by alternating tidal current,the effect on marine ranching zone of thermal water discharged from Guohua power plant was more significant than the water from Wusha Mountain power plant.The southwest side of ranching zone was easier to be influenced than the northeast side.Due to the fact that difference in air-water temperature varies as season changes,the simulated data showed that each season had different temperature rise range and distribution characteristics around the ranching zone.During temperature rise period in spring,rise range was the largest,exceeding 1.0 \u2103,its influential scope of temperature rise was the largest and its effect on ranching zone was also the most significant;nevertheless,during cooling period in autumn,temperature rise range was the smallest(within 0.3 \u2103-0.5 \u2103),and its influential scope of temperature rise was also the smallest.Winter and summer each was within low temperature period and within high temperature period,respectively.Differences in sea-air temperature in both of the two seasons were small,temperature rise ranges were about 0.5 \u2103-1.0 \u2103,and their influential scopes were mediate.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of the data from two fishery resources surveys in Gouqi Island in the summer and autumn of 2005, studies were conducted on the species composition of fisheries resources, the variation of dominant species, the biological characteristics of main fishery species, and species diversity and similarity in and out of seaweed bed. The results indicated that except reef fish, the seasonal changes of fishery species composition in seaweed bed (SB) were much more obvious than those out of the seaweed bed (OSB). Dominant species in SB were much more in summer than those in autumn, whereas the dominant species in summer and autumn remained unchanged in OSB. Japanese stingfish (Sebastiscus marmoratus) acted the dominant species in SB either in summer or in autumn. As for the biological characteristics of various species, there also existed distinct seasonal differences. Sexual distinction in summer was great, but approached the balance in autumn. The average age in autumn was bigger than that in summer, while the average feeding intensity in summer was higher than that in autumn. The values of diversity indexes in SB were bigger than those in OSB either in summer or in autumn, and the values of diversity indexes in summer were bigger than those in autumn either in SB or in OSB. The similarity values were very low between SB and OSB in same season, and between summer and autumn in SB. Through the survey on the spot and biological experiments, the ecological function of seaweed beds in summer as the feeding ground for young fish was further confirmed.",

Numerical calculation is one of the new methods in flow field research on artificial reefs, but its feasibility and accuracy haven\u2019t been widely validated. In this paper, flow fields around solid artificial reef( AR) models with different shapes of cube, pyramid and triangular prism were studied by means of wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulation. According to the principle of similarity flow, the incoming velocities were set respectively; the horizontal and vertical velocities at some representative points were measured compared after given equations with no dimensions. It was found that the average error of velocities at all measuring points of wind tunnel and numerical experiments is about 8%, while u*( the dimensionless velocity along x direction) at most measuring points are basically similar,manifesting the same trend, so the feasibility and accuracy of numerical calculation used for simulating flow fields on AR are validated.",

        "abstract": "Macroalgae covering on the rocky reef around coast of Gouqi Island were surveyed and sampled through diving during 2005 to 2006 and May to June 2010,in order to find out the distribution,constitution and life history of macroalgae.Two composing patterns of macroalgae were shown in the subtidal zone of rocky reef:one was dominated by standing macroalgae Sargassum horneri;another was dominated by smaller macroalgaes,such as Ulva pertusa,which is widely distributed both in intertidal and subtidal zone.The life history of S.horneri showed the four stages of the larger kelp bed:young seedling development period(August to September),slow growth period of seeding(October to February in next year),fast growth and reproduction period(March to May),decomposing and declining period(June to July).The smaller kelp bed exists the whole year,without much difference to outside of the kelp bed.To estimate the composition of fish assemblages in three habitats around Gouqi Island nearshore,i.e.rocky reef,sandy beach and mussel cultivation rafts,we sampled the fish assemblages in three habitats by combined gill nets every month from February 2009 to January 2010.The indexes of Jaccard similarity,Margalef richness and Shannon-wiener diversity were used to compare the variety of fish community structures among habitats,combined with statistical analysis of variance,UPGMA and nMDS.It showed that the differences of fish community structures among above three habitats were significant.The dominant fish species in rocky reef habitat were Sebastiscus marmoratus,Agrammus agrammus and N.albiflora.Fish community was mainly based on the demersal omnivorous rocky fishes,which prey mainly on benthic invertebrates living on macroalgaes.The dominant fish species in sandy beach habitat were Paraplagusia japonica and Nibea albiflora.Fish community was mainly based on the mid-lower migration fishes.For fish assemblages in mussel cultivation raft habitat,which were mainly bigger-size fishes,Mugil cephalus and Decapterus maruadsi were dominant species.The diversity of fish assemblages in rocky reef habitat was higher than that in the other two habitats,due to the relative complex habitat structure.The dominant fish species in both kinds of kelp beds were the same,i.e.S.marmoratus,A.agrammus and N.albiflora.But the structures of fish community were different,due to the species composition of macroalgae covering on rocky reefs.Fish communities in rocky reef habitat dominated by standing larger macroalgae were more stable than those in areas with smaller macroalgae,varied following the life history of S.horneri.The biomass of fishes showed a similar trend to the abundance.But the biomass and abundance of fishes in rocky reef habitat dominated by smaller macroalgaes were quite different.Fish assemblages in areas controlled by smaller macroalgae were affected greatly by the external migration fish assemblages.The species diversity based on abundance of the former was smaller than the latter,but the species diversity based on biomass of the former was larger than the latter.The abundance and biomass have a significant monthly variation in rocky reef habitat with smaller macroalgae.This can be due to the fish assemblages,in which fish species were with larger size,which migrated to rocky reef habitat from open sea area during February to May.Rocky areas covered by standing macroalgae provided a more diversified food selection for local dominant fish species.They possessed an attraction for partial group larvae and small-size individuals.Meanwhile,they offered diversified food choices for upper class of fish,which contribute to the stability of fish community.",

        "abstract": "Based on the monthly investigation data of fish resources in the rocky reef habitat off Gouqi Island from March 2009 to February 2010, this paper studied the dietary composition of three native fish species (Sebasticus marmoratus, Hexagrammos otakii and Hexagrammos agrammus) and three non-native fish species (Lateolabrax japonica, Nibea albiflora and Larimichthys polyactis). The analysis of gut content indicated that the main prey items of these six dominant fish species were Caprellidae, Gammaridea, juvenile S. marmoratus, Engraulis japonicas and Acetes chinensis and the dietary composition of each of the 6 fish species had obvious seasonal variation. There was an intense food competition between native species H. otakii and H. agrammus in autumn, between non-native species N. albiflora and L. polyactis in summer, between non-native species N. albiflora and native species S. marmoratus in autumn, and between non-native species N. albiflora and native species H. otakii in winter. It was suggested the non-native species N. albiflora was the key species in the food competition among the six dominant fish species in this rocky reef habitat, and thus the feeding behaviors of these six fish species could have definite effects on the resource capacity of juvenile S. marmoratus.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the relationships of serum sCD40L level and carotid atherosclerosis as well as its risk factors in premenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE).Methods Fifty-nine premenopausal women with SLE and 42 healthy age-matched female controls were included in this study.Intima media thickness(IMT)and plaques in carotid common arteries were examined by using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography,and serum soluble CD40L(sCD40L)level was determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA).The patients were classified into two subgroups based on serum sCD40L levels.Both traditional and non-traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis including body mass index(BMI),systolic blood pressure(SBP),diastolic blood pressure(DBP),fasting blood glucose,serum lipid profile,disease activity evaluated by SLE disease activity index(SLEDAI),disease duration,and anti-inflammatory treatment were determined.Results The prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis and serum sCD40L level in SLE group were significantly higher than in control group(P<0.01).As compared with normal sCD40L subgroup,SBP,TC,TG and non-HDL-c levels,carotid IMT and occurrence of plaques were increased and HDL-c level was reduced in increased sCD40L subgroup;SLEDAI,dose of corticosteroids,and administration of immunosuppressive agent were also related with serum sCD40L level;in normal sCD40L subgroup,SBP,TC,TG and non-HDL-c levels,incidence of hypertension,carotid IMT and occurrence of plaques were increased and HDL-c level was reduced as compared with control group;the patients with dyslipidaemia,hypertension,carotid atherosclerosis or SLEDAI>9 had significantly elevated sCD40L level,and patients treated with immunosuppressive agent currently had lower sCD40L level.Conclusion The increased prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in premenopausal women with SLE was associated with higher serum sCD40L level.sCD40L was involved with atherosclerosis by affecting traditional risk factors such as high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia.Blood lipid profile,blood pressure,carotid atherosclerosis and anti-SLE treatment contributed to the change of serum sCD40L level.",

Then, the seroconversion was monitored by competitive ELISA.The red blood cells of the ruminants whose antibodies against EHDV turned positive were then inoculated into BHK cells to isolate EHDV, and identified through RT-PCR and neutralization test. The results showed that 3 viruses were isolated from 3 of the sentinel cows whose serum turned positive. The titers of the isolates were around 102.5TCID50/0.1 m L and their serotypes were EHDV-5. This was the first report that EHDV had been isolated in Guangxi, which proved the existence of EHDV infection among the ruminants in subtropical regions of Guangxi.",

And the relationship between the geographic and climatic factors and the distribution of AKAV infection was also analyzed. The results showed that the positive rates of AKAV antibodies of goats and cattle were 36.48% and 63.89% respectively, and there was a significant difference between different regions in Guangxi. Wuzhou is the city which has the highest positive rates of AKAV antibodies(62.50%) in goats, and Hezhou is the city which has the highest positive rates of AKAV antibodies(87.50%)in cattle. The distribution of the territory of infected cattle and goats with AKAV in Guangxi was affected by latitude, temperature and rainfall these geographical and climate factors. Also, the antibody positive rate in relatively higher latitudes in north Guangxi area was lower than that of the lower latitude in southern Guangxi; antibody positive rate of the areas with high temperature and plentiful rainfalls were higher than those in the lower area. The results indicated that there was AKAV infection in cattle and goats in Guangxi Province, which should be controlled reasonably according to the influencing factors.",

        "abstract": "Nucleocapsid (N) protein genes of 24 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains isolated in Guangxi from 1985 to 2008 were amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),and then were cloned, sequenced and compared with 13 IBV reference strains. The results showed that the N genes of 24 isolates were composed of 1 230 nucleotides,encoding a polypeptide of 409 amino acid residues. Deletion and insertion were not found in the N genes of 24 isolates,but it was found that point mutation inducing amino acid substitution was common in N genes of 24 isolates. Compared with the amino acids in three conserved basic regions of N genes among 24 Guangxi isolates and H120 strain,it was found that amino acid substitutions were common in 183 to 232 of N genes in the most isolates and in 334 to 363 of N genes in some isolates. Phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of N genes from 24 IBV isolates and 13 reference IBV strains showed that 24 isolates were classified into four distinct clusters. 19 of 21 isolates from 2004 to 2008 could be classified into cluster \u2160. There were more than 99% identity of nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid of in the N gene among the 3 Guangxi IBV isolates from 1985 to 1988,and these 3 isolates could be classified into cluster \u2162. Recombinations were also found in the genome of IBV isolate GX-NN5. These results suggested that gene mutations and recombinations had occured in the IBV strains isolated in Guangxi from 1985 to 2008.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to construct a bifunctional single chain antibody gene 2E8-PRRSV-Sc Fv by fusing PRRSV antibody with 2E8-Sc Fv and to predict its structure and function. Firstly, PRRSV hybridoma cell strain was used as a mold to construct PRRSV-Sc Fv gene through RT-PCR and SOE-PCR, then this gene was cloned into the C terminal of single chain antibody of anti-human erythrocyte H antigen gene(2E8-Sc Fv) to construct a bifunctional single chain antibody gene, after which sequencing analysis was done and protein structure was predicted by using software for bioinformatics. The results showed that the PRRSV-Sc Fv gene was 735 bp,composed of 45 bp linker, 363 bp VH and 327 bp VL, in which the VH and VL both contained definite CDR zone,FR zone and characteristics of cysteine residues. Results also showed that the PRRSV-Sc Fv gene was highly homologous with mouse-borne single-chain genes, having features of functionally rearranged variable regions of mouse-borne antibodies. A 2E8-PRRSV-Sc Fv gene of 1 470 bp was formed after the fusion of PRRSV-Sc Fv and2E8. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the fused gene encoded 490 amino acids, its hydrophilic value was-0.365, suggesting it was a hydrophilic protein; structure analysis showed that in the gene there were various second structures which could be folded to form a space conformation with multiple groove structures. All these suggested a favorable condition for antigen binding and theoretically good activities. In this study, an anti-PRRSV bifunctional single-chain antibody gene was successfully constructed and its protein structure was predicted. The data and results will provide foundation for subsequent expression of fusion protein and researches on quicker detection of PRRSV antigen.",

Methods: The diabetic rats model was produced by injecting streptozotocin (48 mg \u00b7 kg-1). After 3 months, the HO-1 and HO-2 mRNA and protein expressions in hippocampus of diabetic rats were detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively. Results: 1 The results of RT-PCR showed that the protein expressions of HO-1 and HO-2 mRNA in hippocampus of diabetic group were higher than those of control group (P < 0.01). The expressions of HO-1 and HO-2 mRNA of Clau-treated group (50, 25 mg \u00b7 kg -1) were lower than those of diabetic group (P < 0.01). 2 The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the protein expressions of HO-1 and HO-2 in hippocampus of diabetic group were obviously increased (P < 0.01), but Clau could inhibit the expressions of HO-1 and HO-2. Conclusion: Clau can significantly inhibit HO-1 and HO-2 expressions in hippocampus, which may account for the protective effects.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the effect of genistein isolated from Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides on chronic alcohol-induced hepatic injury and fibrosis. Rats underwent intragastric administration of alcohol (5.0-9.5g/kg) once a day for 24 weeks. A subset of rats were also intragastrically treated with genistein (0.5, 1 or 2mg/kg) once a day. Genistein significantly decreased the plasma alcohol concentration, inhibited the activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases and decreased levels of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and myeloperoxidase, via down-regulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB. Moreover, genistein effectively inhibited collagen deposition and reduced pathological tissue damage as determined by hepatic fibrosis biomarkers, such as total hyaluronic acid, laminin, and type III collagen. Mechanistically, studies showed that genistein markedly reduced lipid peroxidation, recruited the anti-oxidative defense system, inhibited CYP2El activity, promoted extracellular matrix degradation by modulating the levels of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2, induced HSC apoptosis by down-regulating B-cell lymphoma 2 mRNA, and inhibited the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor \u03b2(1) proteins. In conclusion, genistein exerts a preventative effect to ameliorate developing liver injury and even liver fibrosis induced by chronic alcohol administration in rats.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To explore the effect of alloxan combined with atropine on model establishment of diabetes mellitus in rodents. METHODS: The experiment was carried out in the pharmacological laboratory of Pharmacy College, Guangxi Medical University from July to September 2005. Totally 40 mice were randomly divided into control group, alloxan group (intraperitoneal injection with alloxan 50 mg/kg for 2 times), alloxan combined with high dose atropine group (intraperitoneal injection with atropine 2 mg/kg for 4 times) and alloxan combined with middle dose atropine group (intraperitoneal injection with atropine 1 mg/kg for 4 times) after 12 hours of fasting. The mice were intrapertoneally injected with atropine at hour 0.5 before, hour 0.5 after, days 2 and 3 after injection of alloxan, respectively, to establish the alloxan combined with atropine groups. The fasting blood-glucose (FBG) was measured on the 4th and 14th days after injection of alloxan. Meanwhile, a total of 58 rats were randomly divided into high dose alloxan group (intraperitoneal injection 130 mg/kg for 2 days, n=14), middle dose alloxan group (intraperitoneal injection 100 mg/kg for 2 days, n=10), high dose alloxan combined with atropine group (n=14), middle dose alloxan combined with atropine group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The rats except for the control group (intraperitoneal injection with normal saline) were intraperitoneally injected with atropine (2 mg/kg) at hour 0.5 before, hour 0.5 after, days 2 and 3 after injection of alloxan, respectively, to measure the FBG on the 4th, 14th and 30th days after alloxan injection, and the rats were considered as diabetes mellitus (DM) when FBG\u226511.1 mmol/L. The FBG and hyperglycemia remission amplitude (HRA) were measured [HRA (%)=(former hyperglycemia-later hyperglycemia)/former hyperglycemia\u00d7100%], and the established rate of DM rat model, cumulative death rate and mean survival time were also calculated. RESULTS: Among the 40 mice and 58 rats, 38 mice and 51 rats entered the result analysis, in which 1 mice in the alloxan group died on the 2nd day after model establishment and 1 died in alloxan combined with middle dose atropine group when blood sampling; 2 rats in high dose alloxan group and 3 in high dose alloxan combined with atropine group died before measurement of blood glucose and 1 rat in each of the two groups died when blood sampling. \u2460Compared with the alloxan group, the HRA in both alloxan combined with atropine groups were more significant (10.3%, 10.6%, 47.5%, P < 0.01), especially in high dose atropine group. \u2461On the 4th day after model establishment, the HRA in the alloxan combined with high dose atropine group was less than alloxan group [(11.6\u00b13.6), (21.0\u00b16.7)mmol/L], it was steadily increased from the 30th day after model establishment, appearing slowly, moderate, hysteresis, and stable [(15.3\u00b15.9), (13.3\u00b15.5)mmol/L]. \u2462Compared with the same dose alloxan groups, the successful rate of model establishment in the middle dose alloxan combined with atropine group was higher (86%, 80%) but the death rate was lower (30%, 50%), the mean survival time was prolonged (22.4, 15.8 days); Meanwhile, the successful rate of model establishment in high dose alloxan was higher compared with high dose atropine group (75%, 67%), so was the death rate (71%, 57%), but the mean survival time was shorter (7.7, 8.3 days). \u2463Pancreatic pathology suggested that alloxan combined with atropine caused decrease and atrophy of islets of pancreas, and the \u03b2 cells were damaged seriously; while in the simple alloxan group, the \u03b2 cells were damaged slightly, where appeared cells repair and hyperplasia. CONCLUSION: Middle dose alloxan combined with high dose atropine has better effect on establishment of diabetes mellitus model, which can increase the successful rate of model establishment, decrease the death rate and keep the hyperglycemia stable.",

        "title": "Different expressions of p53, bcl-2 and proliferative cell nucleus antigen in osteosarcoma tissues in patients of different nationalities in Xinjiang autonomous region",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone tumor and generally occurs between the age of 10 to 25; moreover, in clinical practice osteosarcoma is found to occur more often in minority nationalities in Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Do its incidence and prognosis vary between nationalities at gene level. OBJECTIVE: To observe the different expressions of p53, bcl-2 and proliferative cell nucleus antigen (PCNA) gene during the development of osteosarcoma between various Xinjiang nationalities. DESIGN: Non-randomized comparative experiment taking clinical pathological specimens as subjects. SETTING: Immunohistochemical Laboratory, the Pathological Center of Xinjiang Medical University. PARTICIPANTS: Totally 52 pieces of specimen were obtained from excised osteosarcoma tissues in the Pathological Department, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, and the Pathological Department, the First Affiliated Hospital of Shihezi University, between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 2001. The 52 cases of osteosarcoma included 29 cases derived from male patients and 23 from female patients; among them there were 12 cases of Kazak minority, 17 cases of Uygur minority and 23 cases of Han nationality. Other 32 specimens were obtained from 32 patients with tumor-like lesions (such as osteofibrous dysplasia or fibrous dysplasia), including 7 cases of Kazak minority, 11 cases of Uygur minority, and 14 cases of Han nationality. The informed consent was obtained from the patients. METHODS: This experiment was carried out at the Immunohistochemical Laboratory, the Pathological Center of Xinjiang Medical University. LSAB method was used to detect p53, bcl-2 and PCNA expression in the two groups. The first antibody was replaced by PBS as blank control, and the available positive expression was taken as positive control. P53 protein and PCNA were observed to express in cell nucleus, appearing obvious red-brown granules with positive expression, whereas Bcl-2 protein was expressed in cytoplasm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \u2460 The expression of p53, bcl-2 and PCNA in osteosarcoma of different nationalities; \u2461 Comparison of the expression of p53, bcl-2 and PCNA in osteosarcoma and bone tumor-like lesions; \u2462 Relationship between the expression of Bcl-2, p53 and PCNA in osteosarcoma. RESULTS: \u2460 The expression of p53, bcl-2 and PCNA in osteosarcoma of different nationalities: The expression of p53, bcl-2 and PCNA in Kazak minority, Uygur minority and Han nationality was not remarkable different from each other (P > 0.05). \u2461 Comparison of the expression of p53, bcl-2 and PCNA in osteosarcoma and bone tumor-like lesions: The expression of P53, Bcl-2 protein and PCNA in osteosarcoma was remarkably higher than that in tumor-like lesions (42.31% vs. 3.13 %, 59.62% vs. 0, 75% vs. 31.25 %, P < 0.01). \u2462 Relationship between the expression of bcl-2, p53 and PCNA in osteosarcoma: There was a close correlation between bcl-2 and p53, as well as between bcl-2 and PCNA in osteosarcoma tissues (\u03c72 =5.818 2, 4.900 0, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there was no statistical difference between various nationalities in the expression of p53, bcl-2 and PCNA, as well as osteosarcoma differentiation, suggesting that these genes may share the common regulation during the development of osteosarcoma, which is less associated with their nationality-related hereditary background.",

JGC capsule, CJGC capsule or same volume normal saline were given orally to mice in corresponding groups, intragastric infusion once per day (JGC capsule group: 14.47 g/kg JGC capsule; CJGC capsule groups: 12.96 g/kg, 6.48 g/kg and 3.24 g/kg CJGC capsule, which was the upgraded products of JGC capsule and consisted of Herba Abri, Herba Artemisiae Scopariae, cape jasmine fruit, sanchi, cow-bezoar and whilt peony root, etc in compatibility). Five days later, except the control group, the mice of other groups were administrated intraperitoneally with 1 g/L CCl 4/peanut oil solution (10 mL /kg) or D-Gal (800 mg/kg). After 16-hour fasting, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were detected, and histopathological changes of liver were also observed. Results: All the 114 mice were involved in the analysis of results without drop. In the experiments of acute liver injuries induced by CCl 4 and D-Gal, JGC capsule and CJGC capsule at dose of 12.96 g/kg and 6.48 g/kg remarkably decreased the activities of serum ALT and AST (compared with model group, P < 0.05-0.01). Moreover, JGC and each dose of CJGC capsule notably lessened the histopathological damage (compared with model group, P < 0.05-0.01). There was no significant difference in the effects of CJGC capsule and JGC capsule (P > 0.05). Conclusion: CJGC plays the protective effects obviously on acute chemical liver injury induced by CCl 4 and D-Gal in mice, identical as JGC capsule.",

        "abstract": "An ingredient was isolated from Acanthus ilicifolius and identified as 4-hydroxy-2(3H)-benzoxazolone (HBOA). Its protective effects and underlying mechanism on liver fibrosis were investigated. Briefly, rats were intragastrically administrated with 50% CCl twice a week for 12 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. Meanwhile, the animals were treated with various medicines from weeks 8 to 12. Then the histological change, serum biochemical index, inflammatory factors and hepatocyte apoptosis were detected. Moreover, the TGF-\u03b21/Smads, NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling pathways were also detected to illustrate the underlying mechanism. The results showed that HBOA significantly ameliorated CCl-induced liver injury and collagen accumulation in rats, as evidenced by the histopathologic improvement. Moreover, HBOA markedly decreased hepatocyte apoptosis by regulating the expression levels of caspase-3, -9 and -12, as well as the Bcl-2 family. The mechanism study showed that HBOA significantly decreased the expressions of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen and inhibited the generation of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) components by restoring the balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and its inhibitor (TIMPs). HBOA markedly alleviated oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines through inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway. In addition, HBOA significantly down-regulated the levels of TGF-\u03b21, Smad2/3, Smad4 and up-regulated the level of Smad7, inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/Smads signaling pathway. Moreover, HBOA significantly blocked the ERK signaling pathway, leading to the inactivation of hepatic stellate cells. This study suggests that HBOA exerts a protective effect against liver fibrosis via modulating the TGF-\u03b21/Smads, NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling pathways, which will be developed as a potential agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that Gingko biloba leaf extract (GbE) is effective in promoting the functions recovery of the brain that follows traumatic injury, in improving the dysfunctions of learning and memory of the elderly, and it is also effective in improving the plasticity in central nervous system (CNS). However, what is the effect on learning and memory functions of rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus\ufe56 OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of GbE on the learning and memory dysfunction and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressions in hippocampus of diabetic rats. DESIGN: Complete-random design, controlled experimental study. SETTING: Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University. MATERIALS: A total of 84 male Wistar rats (180-220 g), 8 weeks old, SPF, were used in this study. GbE (containing 24.8% flavone glycosides and 6.2% diterpene lactone) was purchased from Guilin Xintejia Natural plants Pharmaceutical Factory, Guangxi Province, Lot No. 200405. METHODS: The experiment was completed at the Pharmacology Lab (Provincial Lab) of the Experimental Center of Guangxi Medical University from June 2004 to March 2005. \u2460 A total of 70 rats were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at a dose of 55 mg/kg dissolved in citrate buffer (pH4.4) after 24 hours fasting. Tail vein blood glucose concentration was determined 4 days later using ONE TOUCH glucose meter. A total of 56 streptozotocin-treated rats with a blood glucose concentration of > 15 mmol/L were recognized as type 2 diabetic rats. \u2461 These diabetic rats were randomly divided into model group, insulin group, high-dose GbE group, and low-dose GbE group. There were 14 rats in each group. There was no difference in the blood glucose concentration among the groups. Another 14 male rats with an intraperitoneal injection of citrate buffer solution were served as control group. After division, drugs were given. Insulin 10 \u03bc/kg was injected subcutaneously every day for 6 months. GbE 100 mg/kg and GbE 50 mg/kg were administered through intra-gastric method every day for 6 months. The diabetic group and control group were administered normal solution through intra-gastric method every day for 6 months. \u2462 Six months later, Morris water maze was operated on each group of rats. The Morris water maze consisted of a large circular pool 100 cm dimension, 60 cm height, filled to a depth of 42 cm with water at (25\u00b11) \u2103 . Within the pool a submerged platform (round, black, 8 cm diameter, 2 cm below the water surface) was hidden on a fixed location, 20 cm from the edge of the pool, in which milk powder was dissolved to obscure the platform. The rat could climb on the platform to escape from the necessity of swimming. The rats were trained to locate the hidden platform. The animals were received 4 trials (2 in the morning, and 2 in the afternoon) per day on 4 consecutive days. The rat was given a maximum of 90 s to find the hidden platform. On the 5th day, the rat's learning ability was examined by observing the time to find the hidden platform (escape latency) in 90 s and the platform-finding strategy (prompt and straight way, marked 4 scores; hesitating first and then straight way, marked 3 scores; random way, marked 2 scores; aimless way and around the pool border, marked 1 score). On the 8th day, the escape latency and the platform-finding strategy were observed to examine the rat's memory level. \u2463 After the Morris water maze test, 8 rats of each group were sacrificed by decapitation for RT-PCR of GFAP mRNA expression, and 6 rats of each group were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry of GFAP protein expression. GFAP mRNA expression level was analyzed by the expression ratio of the interest GFAP to the control \u03b2-actin according to the computer image analysis. The GFAP protein expression was analyzed by the volume density of GFAP in hippocampus. \u2464 Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and q-test. MAIN OUTCOME MESURES: The effects of GbE on the performances of the water maze Morris of type 2 diabetic rats and both GFAP mRNA and protein expressions in hippocampus. RESULTS: A total of 14 streptozotocin-treated rats with a blood glucose concentration of < 15 mmol/L were rejected from the study. \u2460 The performance of diabetic rats in the Morris water maze was significantly impaired compared to control group, the results on the 5th day and the 8th day showed that both escape latency and platform-finding strategy scores were decreased (P < 0.01). The escape latency of both insulin treatment and GbE treatments on the 5th day and the 8th day was shorter than that of diabetic group, the platform-finding strategy scores was higher than that of diabetic group (P < 0.05-0.01). There was no marked difference among the insulin treatment and GbE treatments groups in performance of the water maze Morris (P > 0.05). \u2461 The levels of both GFAP mRNA and protein expressions in hippocampus: Statistical analyses indicated that the level of GFAP mRNA expression of diabetic rats was significantly higher than that of the 3 other groups (P < 0.01). Compared to control group, the diabetic rats showed a high immunoreactivity, the GFAP body was enlarged markedly, apophysis was obviously longer, the expressed numbers were increased, and the volume density of GFAP was also increased significantly (P < 0.01). Compared to the diabetic group, the insulin treatment and GbE treatments groups showed a low immunoreactivity, the GFAP body was markedly smaller, apophysis was obviously shorter, the expressed numbers were decreased, and the volume density of GFAP was also decreased significantly (P < 0.01). There were no marked differences in both GFAP mRNA and protein expressions among the insulin treatment and GbE treatments groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is cognition impairment in type 2 diabetic rats, the responsive GFAP may take a part in the progress of the learning and memory dysfunction. GbE can decrease markedly the reactive hypertrophy of astrocytes of diabetic hippocampus and improve the learning and memory dysfunction in diabetic rats.",

The conclusions of the published reports on the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms -607C/A (rs1946518) and -137G/C (rs187238) located in the IL-18 gene promoter and RA risk remain controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between IL-18 gene promoter (-607A/C and -137C/G) polymorphisms and RA using (1) allele, (2) codominant, (3) dominant, and (4) recessive models. Literature search was conducted up to January, 2013, in PubMed, EMBASE, Spring-link, Web of Science, Wanfang (Chinese) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). A total of 10 studies from eight articles involving 2,662 cases and 2,168 controls for -607A/C polymorphism and 9 studies from six articles involving 1,331 cases and 1,468 controls for -137C/G polymorphism were considered in the meta-analysis. For the relationship of IL-18 -607A/C polymorphism with RA risk, significant association was observed in allele model (OR = 0.778, 95 % CI = 0.633-0.955) and dominant model (OR = 0.618, 95 % CI = 0.466-0.819). However, no significant association could be observed between -137C/G polymorphism and RA risk under all genetic models (allele model: OR = 0.940, 95 % CI = 0.777-1.138; codominant model: OR = 1.079, 95 % CI = 0.574-2.029; dominant model: OR = 0.913, 95 % CI = 0.779-1.069; recessive model: OR = 1.133, 95 % CI = 0.586-2.190). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant result was also found in Asian populations but not found in Caucasian populations for the relationship of IL-18 -607A/C polymorphism with RA risk; while no obvious association was found between IL-18 -137C/G polymorphism and RA risk. This meta-analysis indicates that IL-18 -607A/C polymorphism in promoter region may be associated with RA risk.",

        "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the protective effects of Acanthus ilicifolius alkaloid A [4-hydroxy-2-benzoxazolone (HBOA)] and its acetylated derivatives including 4-acetoxy-2-benzoxazolone (TC-2) and 3-acetyl-4-acetoxy-2-benzoxazolone (TC-3) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were given CCl4 twice per week for 8 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. Then, they were treated with HBOA, TC-2, and TC-3 daily for 4 weeks, respectively. The serum indicators including total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), globulin, hyaluronic acid (HA), and laminin (LN) were measured by commercial kits. The messenger ribonucleic acid expression of adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21 ) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4 ) was determined by reverse-transcriptase -PCR. The proteins of adiponectin, TGF-\u03b21 , \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and TLR4 were also detected by the immunohistochemical assay. The results showed that HBOA, TC-2, and TC-3 significantly attenuated the fibrotic degree induced by CCl4 as evidenced by higher levels of TP, Alb, adiponectin, and PPAR-\u03b3, which in turn decreased the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells. Moreover, those drugs markedly decreased the levels of HA, LN, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, TGF-\u03b21 , \u03b1-SMA, and TLR4 . Our study indicates that HBOA, TC-2, and TC-3 have beneficial effects against liver fibrosis, and the mechanisms may be related to the inhibition of inflammatory response.",

[Methods] Rats were divided into normal saline control group(n=10)and formaldehyde inhalation group(n=10)randomly, and then put in small iron cages which were placed in a self-made intoxication chamber, with preset 50g dry sodalime and two 50 ml culture plates filled with 40% formaldehyde liquid. Oxygen was supplied consecutively via a rubber pipe with one end connected to air pump and another end put under the formaldehyde liquid to promote the formaldehyde evaporating. The rats inhaled formaldehyde air consecutively for 2 hours and were killed 5 hours later. Lungs and hearts of rats were cut and weighed, and the cardiopulmonary index and lung index were calculated, the lung tissue were sent for routine pathologic examination. Rats of control group were treated the same way as formaldehyde inhalation group, but used normal saline instead of formaldehyde liquid. [Results] Compare with normal saline group, cardiopulmonary index(1.747\u00b10.162 vs 1.577\u00b10.095, P < 0.05)and lung index(5.38\u00b10.60 vs 4.67\u00b10.34, P < 0.01)increased significantly in the formaldehyde group. The pathological section of the lungs showed that pulmonary alveoli fill with some fluid and their septum widened in the formaldehyde group rats.

        "abstract": "Objective To study the effects of vitamin B_6(VitB_6) injection on small intestinal peristalsis in mice and its mechanisms.Methods The mice were divided into 12 groups:calcium chloride injection group(1 mg/10 g),neostigmine methylsulfate injection group(0.001 5 mg/10 g),atropine sulfate injection group(0.005 mg/10 g),their combination with VitB_6 injection and high/low dose treated groups,high dose VitB_6 injection group(5 mg/10 g),low dose VitB_6 injection group(0.5 mg/10 g) and physiologic saline group(0.1 mL/ 10 g ).After administration 30 minutes,mice were intragastric administration Indian ink(0.1 mL/g),and they were luxated and put to death 20 minutes later.The mice belly were cut open,the length of intestine and distance of Indian ink that had moved were measured,and then the ink progradation rate were calculated.Results Compared with control group,the high dose VitB_6 injection could inhibit normal intestinal peristalsis of mice markedly(P<0.01).Both of high dose and low dose VitB_6 injection could inhibit the excited action of calcium chloride significantly( P_a< 0.01),and high dose VitB_6 injection could enhance the inhibited action of atropine(P<0.01).Both of high dose and low dose VitB_6 injection had antagonistic effect on the excited action of proserine methylsulfate,but it was not statistically significant(P_a>0.05).Conclusions VitB_6 injection can inhibit hyperanakinesia of small intestine in mice,especially high dose.And this will be provided as theory foundation on enterospasm treatment.",

METHODS: The death rate of mice infected by staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli was observed to investigate the antibacterial effects.Crotonoil-induced auricle edema,cotton ball-induced granuloma and trauma-induced toe congestion were performed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects in mice.Endotoxin-induced fever was performed to observe the antipyretic effect in rabbit.Mouse twisting numbers induced by acetic acid,mouse pain threshold after heat stimulation and rat twisting numbers of dysmenorrhea were observed to investigate the analgesic effects. RESULTS: Huahong Capsule had a tendency to decrease the death rate of mice infected by bacteria.It could remarkably inhibit edema of auricle of ear,formation of granuloma and toe congestion in mice.It decreased obviously the temperature raised by endotoxin in rabbit.It could reduce mouse twisting numbers and prolong pain thresholds. CONCLUSION: Huahong Capsule has pharmacological effects in accordance with its clinical functions and uses.",

The effect and mechanism of O.\u00a0vulgare didymin (OVD) on human HepG2 liver carcinoma cell was then assessed. Our results showed that OVD strongly inhibited the viability, clonogenicity and migration of HepG2 cells. OVD significantly induced apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase by regulating cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and CDK4. The anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were associated with changes in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, OVD attenuated the mitochondrial membrane potential, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c. In addition, OVD inhibited the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways by increasing the level of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP). Our study indicates that OVD induces apoptosis against of HepG2 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction and inactivation of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways by up-regulating RKIP.",

        "abstract": "The large-scale curvature of a \u00d1ux rope can help propel it outward from the Sun. Here we extend previous two-dimensional \u00d1ux-rope models of coronal mass ejections to include the curvature force. To obtain analytical results, we assume axial symmetry and model the \u00d1ux rope as a torus that encircles the Sun. Initially, the \u00d1ux rope is suspended in the corona by a balance between magnetic tension, compres- sion, and curvature forces, but this balance is lost if the photospheric sources of the coronal -eld slowly decay with time. The evolution of the system shows catastrophic behavior as occurred in previous models, but, unlike the previous models, \u00d1ux ropes with large radii are more likely to erupt than ones with small radii. The maximum total magnetic energy that can be stored before equilibrium is lost is 1.53 times the energy of the potential -eld, and this value is less than the limiting value of 1.662 for the fully opened -eld. As a consequence, the loss of ideal MHD equilibrium that occurs in the model cannot completely open the magnetic -eld. However, the loss of equilibrium does lead to the sudden formation of a current sheet, and if rapid reconnection occurs in this sheet, then the \u00d1ux rope can escape from the Sun. We also -nd that the -eld can gradually become opened without su\u2020ering any loss of equilibrium if the photospheric -eld strength falls below a critical value. This behavior is analogous to the opening of a spherically symmetric arcade in response to a -nite amount of shear.

        "abstract": "We investigated a peculiar metric type II solar radio burst with a broken lane structure that was observed on November 13, 2012. In addition to the radio data, we also studied the data in other wavelengths. The bursts were associated with two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and two flares that originated from Active Region AR 11613. A long current sheet developed in the first CME, and the second CME collided with the current sheet first and then merged with the first CME. Combined information revealed by the multi-wavelength data indicated that a coronal shock was accountable for the type II radio burst and that the collision of this shock with the current sheet resulted in the broken lane of the type II radio burst. The type II burst lane re-formed after the shock passed through the current sheet. Furthermore, we estimated the thickness of the current sheet from a gap in the lane of the type II burst, and found that the result is consistent with previous ones obtained for various events observed in different wavelengths by different instruments. In addition, the regular type II burst associated with the first CME/flare was also studied, and the magnetic field in each source region of the two type II bursts was deduced in different ways.",

        "abstract": "Properties of photospheric bright points (BPs) near an active region have been studied in TiO lambda 7058 angstrom images observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope of the Yunnan Observatories. We developed a novel recognition method that was used to identify and track 2010 BPs. The observed evolving BPs are classified into isolated (individual) and non-isolated (where multiple BPs are observed to display splitting and merging behaviors) sets. About 35.1% of BPs are non-isolated. For both isolated and non-isolated BPs, the brightness varies from 0.8 to. 1.3 times the average background intensity and follows a Gaussian distribution. The lifetimes of BPs follow a lognormal distribution, with characteristic lifetimes of (267 +/- 140). s and (421 +/- 255). s, respectively. Their size also follows log-normal distribution, with an average size of about (2.15 +/- 0.74). x. 10(4) km(2) and (3.00 +/- 1.31). x 10(4) km(2) for area, and (163 +/- 27) km and (191 +/- 40) km for diameter, respectively. Our results indicate that regions with strong background magnetic field have higher BP number density and higher BP area coverage than regions with weak background field. Apparently, the brightness/size of BPs does not depend on the background field. Lifetimes in regions with strong background magnetic field are shorter than those in regions with weak background field, on average.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is the most likely mechanism responsible for the high temperature events that are observed in strongly magnetized locations around the temperature minimum in the low solar chromosphere. This work improves upon our previous work [Ni et al., Astrophys. J. 852, 95 (2018)] by using a more realistic radiative cooling model computed from the OPACITY project and the CHIANTI database. We find that the rate of ionization of the neutral component of the plasma is still faster than recombination within the current sheet region. For low beta plasmas, the ionized and neutral fluid flows are well-coupled throughout the reconnection region resembling the single-fluid Sweet-Parker model dynamics. Decoupling of the ion and neutral inflows appears in the higher beta case with beta(0) = 1.46, which leads to a reconnection rate about three times faster than the rate predicted by the Sweet-Parker model. In all cases, the plasma temperature increases with time inside the current sheet, and the maximum value is above 2 x 10(4) K when the reconnection magnetic field strength is greater than 500 G. While the more realistic radiative cooling model does not result in qualitative changes of the characteristics of magnetic reconnection, it is necessary for studying the variations of the plasma temperature and ionization fraction inside current sheets in strongly magnetized regions of the low solar atmosphere. It is also important for studying energy conversion during the magnetic reconnection process when the hydrogen-dominated plasma approaches full ionization. Published by AIP Publishing.",

        "abstract": "Kinematic characteristics of electrons and protons in the magnetic reconnecting current sheet in the presence of a guide field are investigated. Particle trajectories are calculated for different values of the guide field by a test-particle calculation. The relationship between the final energy and the initial position has also been studied. We found that the addition of a guide field not only allows particles to get more energy and not only results in the separation of electrons and protons, but also causes the reconnecting electric field to selectively accelerate electrons and protons for different initial positions. The energy spectrum eventually obtained is the common power-law spectrum, and as the guide field increases, the index for the spectrum of electrons decreases rapidly. However, for a weak background magnetic field, proton spectra are not very sensitive to the guide field; but for a strong background field, the dependence of the spectrum index is similar to the electron spectrum. Meanwhile, kinematic characteristics of the accelerated particles in the current sheet including multiple X-points and O-points were also investigated. The result indicates that the existence of the multiple X- and O-points helps particles trapped in the accelerating region to gain more energy, and yields the double or multiple power-law feature. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Compared with the 37-element solar AO system developed for the 26-cm Solar Fine Structure Telescope, administered by Yunnan Astronomical Observatories, this AO system has two updates: one is the subaperture arrangement of the WFS changed from square to hexagon; the other is the high speed camera of the WFS and the corresponding real time controller. The WFS can be operated at a frame rate of 2100 Hz and the error correction bandwidth can exceed 100 Hz. After AO correction, the averaged residual image motion and the averaged RMS wavefront error are reduced to 0.06 u0027u0027 and 45 nm, respectively. The results of on-sky testing observations demonstrate better contrast and finer structures of the images taken with AO than those without AO.",

        "abstract": "Kelvin-Hemholtz (K-H) instability in a coronal EUV jet is studied via 2.5D MHD numerical simulations. The jet results from magnetic reconnection due to the interaction of the newly emerging magnetic field and the pre-existing magnetic field in the corona. Our results show that the Alfven Mach number along the jet is about 5-14 just before the instability occurs, and it is even higher than 14 at some local areas. During the K-H instability process, several vortex-like plasma blobs with high temperature and high density appear along the jet, and magnetic fields have also been rolled up and the magnetic configuration including anti-parallel magnetic fields forms, which leads to magnetic reconnection at many X-points and current sheet fragments inside the vortex-like blob. After magnetic islands appear inside the main current sheet, the total kinetic energy of the reconnection outflows decreases, and cannot support the formation of the vortex-like blob along the jet any longer, then the K-H instability eventually disappears. We also present the results about how the guide field and flux emerging speed affect the K-H instability. We find that a strong guide field inhibits shock formation in the reconnecting upward outflow regions but helps secondary magnetic islands appear earlier in the main current sheet, and then apparently suppresses the K-H instability. As the speed of the emerging magnetic field decreases, the K-H instability appears later, the highest temperature inside the vortex blob gets lower and the vortex structure gets smaller.",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive research on various global waves in solar eruptions, debate continues on the intrinsic nature of them. In this work, we performed numerical experiments of the coronal mass ejection with emphases on the associated large-scale MHD waves. A fast-mode shock forms in front of the flux rope during the eruption with a dimming region following it, and the development of a three-component structure of the ejecta is observed. At the flank of the flux rope, the slow-mode shock and the velocity vortices are also invoked. The dependence of the eruption energetics on the strength of the background field and the coronal plasma density distribution is apparent: the stronger the background field is, and/or the lower the coronal plasma density is, the more energetic the eruption is. In the lower Alfve\u2032n speed environment, the slow mode shock and the large scale velocity vortices may be the source of the EIT wave. In the high Alfve\u2032n speed environment, on the other hand, the echo due to the reflection of the fast shock on the bottom boundary could be so strong that its interaction with the slow mode shock and the velocity vortices produces the second echo propagating downward and causing the secondary disturbance to the boundary surface. We suggest that this second echo, together with the slow shock and the velocity vortices, could constitute a possible candidate of the source for the EIT wave.",

        "abstract": "We introduce how the catastrophe model for solar eruptions predicted the formation and development of the long current sheet (CS) and how the observations were used to recognize the CS at the place where the CS is presumably located. Then, we discuss the direct measurement of the CS region thickness by studying the brightness distribution of the CS region at different wavelengths. The thickness ranges from  to about  at heights between 0.27 and  from the solar surface. But the traditional theory indicates that the CS is as thin as the proton Larmor radius, which is of order tens of meters in the corona. We look into the huge difference in the thickness between observations and theoretical expectations. The possible impacts that affect measurements and results are studied, and physical causes leading to a thick CS region in which reconnection can still occur at a reasonably fast rate are analyzed. Studies in both theories and observations suggest that the difference between the true value and the apparent value of the CS thickness is not significant as long as the CS could be recognised in observations. We review observations that show complex structures and flows inside the CS region and present recent numerical modelling results on some aspects of these structures. Both observations and numerical experiments indicate that the downward reconnection outflows are usually slower than the upward ones in the same eruptive event. Numerical simulations show that the complex structure inside CS and its temporal behavior as a result of turbulence and the Petschek-type slow-mode shock could probably account for the thick CS and fast reconnection. But whether the CS itself is that thick still remains unknown since, for the time being, we cannot measure the electric current directly in that region. We also review the most recent laboratory experiments of reconnection driven by energetic laser beams, and discuss some important topics for future works.",

        "abstract": "We simulate several magnetic reconnection processes in the low solar chromosphere/photosphere; the radiation cooling, heat conduction and ambipolar diffusion are all included. Our numerical results indicate that both the high temperature (8 \u00d7 104 K) and low temperature (~104 K) magnetic reconnection events can happen in the low solar atmosphere (100\u2013600 km above the solar surface). The plasma \u03b2 controlled by plasma density and magnetic fields is one important factor to decide how much the plasma can be heated up. The low temperature event is formed in a high \u03b2 magnetic reconnection process, Joule heating is the main mechanism to heat plasma and the maximum temperature increase is only several thousand Kelvin. The high temperature explosions can be generated in a low \u03b2 magnetic reconnection process, slow and fast-mode shocks attached at the edges of the well developed plasmoids are the main physical mechanisms to heat the plasma from several thousand Kelvin to over 8 \u00d7 104 K. Gravity in the low chromosphere can strongly hinder the plasmoid instability and the formation of slow-mode shocks in a vertical current sheet. Only small secondary islands are formed; these islands, however, are not as well developed as those in the horizontal current sheets. This work can be applied to understand the heating mechanism in the low solar atmosphere and could possibly be extended to explain the formation of common low temperature Ellerman bombs (~104 K) and the high temperature Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) bombs (8 \u00d7 104) in the future.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection in strongly magnetized regions around the temperature minimum region of the low solar atmosphere is studied by employing MHD-based simulations of a partially ionized plasma within a reactive 2.5D multi-fluid model. It is shown that in the absence of magnetic nulls in a low beta plasma, the ionized and neutral fluid flows are well-coupled throughout the reconnection region. However, non-equilibrium ionization-recombination dynamics play a critical role in determining the structure of the reconnection region, leading to much lower temperature increases and a faster magnetic reconnection rate as compared to simulations that assume plasma to be in ionization-recombination equilibrium. The rate of ionization of the neutral component of the plasma is always faster than recombination within the current sheet region even when the initial plasma beta is as high as beta(0) = 1.46. When the reconnecting magnetic field is in excess of a kilogauss and the plasma beta is lower than 0.0145, the initially weakly ionized plasmas can become fully ionized within the reconnection region and the current sheet can be strongly heated to above 2.5 x 10(4) K, even as most of the collisionally dissipated magnetic energy is radiated away. The Hall effect increases the reconnection rate slightly, but in the absence of magnetic nulls it does not result in significant asymmetries or change the characteristics of the reconnection current sheet down to meter scales.",

        "abstract": "We perform two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of coronal jets driven by flux emergence along the lower boundary. The reconnection layers are susceptible the formation of blobs that are ejected in the jet. Our simulation with low plasma $beta$ (Case I) shows that magnetic islands form easily and propagate upwards in the jet. These islands are multithermal and thus are predicted to show up in hot channels (335 AA, and 211 AA) and the cool channel (304 AA) in observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory}. The islands have maximum temperatures of 8 MK, lifetimes of 120 s, diameters of 6 Mm, and velocities of 200 km s$^{-1}$. These parameters are similar to the properties of blobs observed in EUV jets by AIA@. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops in our simulation with moderately high plasma $beta$ (Case II), and leads to the formation of bright vortex-like blobs above the multiple high magneto-sonic Mach number regions that appear along the jet. These vortex-like blobs can also be identified in the AIA channels. However, they eventually move downward and disappear after the high magneto-sonic Mach number regions disappear. In the lower plasma $beta$ case, the lifetime for the jet is shorter, the jet and magnetic islands are formed with higher velocities and temperatures, the current sheet fragments are more chaotic, and more magnetic islands are generated. Our results show that the plasmoid instability and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability along the jet are both possible causes of the formation of blobs observed at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) and quasi-isostatic pressing method were used to prepare MCMB based graphite (MG) for spherical fuel element to inhibit the infiltration of liquid fluoride salt in molten salt reactor (MSR). Characteristics of mercury infiltration and molten salt infiltration in MG were investigated and compared with A3-3 (graphite for spherical fuel element in high temperature gas cooled reactor) to identify the infiltration behaviors. The results indicated that MG had a low porosity about 14%, and an average pore diameter of 96\u00a0nm. Fluoride salt occupation of A3-3 (average pore diameter was 760\u00a0nm) was 10\u00a0wt% under 6.5\u00a0atm, whereas salt gain did not infiltrate in MG even up to 6.5\u00a0atm. It demonstrated that MG could inhibit the infiltration of liquid fluoride salt effectively. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of MG lies in 6.01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22126 \u00a0K \u22121  (\u03b1  \u2225  ) and 6.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22126 \u00a0K \u22121  (\u03b1 \u22a5 ) at the temperature range of 25\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C. The anisotropy factor of MG calculated by CTE maintained below 1.02, which could meet the requirement of the spherical fuel element (below 1.30). The constant isotropic property of MG is beneficial for the integrity and safety of the graphite used in the spherical fuel element for a MSR.",

However, encapsulation of metallic PCMs is essential for its practical application owing to its highly corrosive to encapsulation materials and its volume expansion during the phase change. The present study applied spouted bed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to encapsulate metallic PCMs. A novel heat storage capsule was developed using iron core encapsulated with porous pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layer, dense PyC layer and dense silicon carbide (SiC) layer in turn from inside to outside. The inner porous PyC layer is used to accommodate the volume expansion of the iron core and the outer dense SiC layer act as package layer and the oxidation resistance layer. The SiC/C-shells/Fe-core capsules could work at a temperature up to 1100\u00a0\u00b0C and include solid-solid phase change (48.85\u00a0J/g, 686\u00a0\u00b0C) and solid-liquid phase change (128\u00a0J/g\uff0c1136\u00a0\u00b0C). It is demonstrated that the SiC/C-shells/Fe-core capsules have several desired characteristics, such as high thermal conductivity and high thermal density, excellent oxidation resistance and good thermal cycling performance.",

To enhance the thermal conductivity of PCMs, graphite powder was dispersed into the PCM pellets. Meanwhile, cellulose particles, as sacrificial particles, were mixed with the PCM pellets to relieve the volumetric expansion of the PCMs during the phase change process. The effects of the latent heat, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion behavior of the PCM/graphite capsule were investigated. The PCM capsules were able to work at temperatures up to 900\u202f\u00b0C, including undergoing a solid-liquid phase change at 803\u202f\u00b0C with a latent heat of 159.6\u202fJ\u202fg \u22121 , and survived more than 300 thermal cycles as thermal energy storage devices. The thermal performance of the PCM capsules between 500 and 900\u202f\u00b0C was numerically investigated using a modified one-dimensional (1-D) enthalpy-based model. The results indicated that the average heat transfer of the PCM capsules with graphite-dispersed core was significantly elevated during both the charging (by 92.5% for 99% charge) and discharging (by 168.4% for 99% discharge) processes, compared to the pure core PCMs.",

The preparation of thorium sol is an important step for fabrication of thorium-based fuel kernels, such as thorium carbide and thorium oxide. The gel quality affects the gel particle dispersion and the final products. In this work, thorium sols were prepared using Th(NO3)4 and NH3\u00b7H2O by sol\u2013gel method. The effects of thorium concentration, mole ratio of NH4 +/NO3 \u2212and reaction temperature on the pH, viscosity, turbidity, particle size and the thorium sol distribution were investigated. The results show that the viscosity and turbidity increased with the NH4 +/NO3 \u2212 ratio; the turbidity and colloidal particle size increased with the reaction temperature, which affected little the sol viscosity; the sol viscosity increased with the thorium concentration, which virtually did not change the turbidity; and the particle size decreased and the size distribution narrowed with increasing thorium concentration. The sol could be stored at room temperature for one day without significant property changes. Thorium gel spheres of good quality were prepared at 60\u00a0\u00b0C with the NH4 +/NO3 \u2212 ratio of 75\u201385% and the thorium concentration of 1.2\u20131.4\u00a0mol/L.",

The result of XRD reveals that diffraction patterns of FLiBe appear in matrix graphite infiltrated with FLiBe at a pressure of 0.8 MPa and 1.0 MPa. The surface morphology from SEM shows that FLiBe mainly distributes within macro-pores of matrix graphite. PAL measurement indicates that there are mainly two positron lifetime components in all specimens:\u03c41~0.21 ns and \u03c42 \u00ad~0.47 ns, ascribed to annihilation of positrons in bulk and trapped-positrons at surface, respectively. The average positron lifetime decreases with infiltration pressure, due to the decrease in annihilation fraction of positrons with surface after infiltration of FLiBe into macro-pores.",

        "abstract": "The impregnation behavior of molten 2LiF\u2013BeF2 (FLiBe) salt into a graphite matrix of fuel elements for a solid fuel thorium molten salt reactor (TMSR-SF) at pressures varying from 0.4 to 1.0 MPa was studied by mercury intrusion, molten salt impregnation, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. It was found that the entrance pore diameter of the graphite matrix is less than 1.0 \u00b5m and the contact angle is about 135\u00b0. The threshold impregnation pressure was found to be around 0.6 MPa experimentally, consistent with the predicted value of 0.57 MPa by the Washburn equation. With the increase of pressure from 0.6 to 1.0 MPa, the average weight gain of the matrix increased from 3.05 to 10.48%, corresponding to an impregnation volume increase from 2.74 to 9.40%. The diffraction patterns of FLiBe are found in matrices with high impregnation pressures (0.8 MPa and 1.0 MPa). The FLiBe with sizes varying from tens of nanometers to a micrometer mainly occupies the open pores in the graphite matrix. The graphite matrix could inhibit the impregnation of the molten salt in the TMSR-SF with a maximum operation pressure of less than 0.5 MPa.",

The Basket-Fuel-Assembly Molten Salt Reactor (BFAMSR) is a new concept design based on fuel assemblies composed of fuel pebbles made of TRISO-coated particles. Four refueling patterns, similar to the fuel management strategy for water reactors, are designed and analyzed for BFAMSR in terms of economy and security. The MCNPX is employed to calculate the parameters, such as the total duration time, cycle length, discharge burnup, total discharge quantity of 235U, total discharge quantity of 239Pu, neutron flux distribution and power distribution. The in\u2013out loading pattern has the highest burnup and duration time, the worst neutron flux and power distribution and the lowest neutron leakage. The out\u2013in pattern possesses the most uniform neutron flux distribution, the lowest burnup and total duration time, and the highest neutron leakage. The out\u2013in partition alternate pattern has slightly higher burnup, longer total duration time and smaller neutron leakage than that of the out\u2013in loading pattern at the cost of sacrificing some neutron flux distribution and power distribution. However, its alternative distribution of fuel elements cut down the refueling time. The low-leakage pattern is the second highest in burnup, and total duration time, and its neutron flux and power distributions are the second most uniform.",

Modification with polymeric surfactant is a widely used strategy to enhance water dispersibility of CNTs. This study investigated the toxic effects of various Pluronic F-68 (PF68)-coated multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) on rat bone marrow-derived MSCs.PF68-coated MWCNTs showed favorable biocompatibility to MSCs that the cell viability, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were not altered after 24 h of co-incubation. Nevertheless, significant apoptosis induction and massive ROS release were found following extended exposure (48 and 72 h), and the toxic impact was dependent on the initial surface properties of the encapsulated MWCNTs. All the types of PF68-coated MWCNTs did not affect the cell-surface markers and in vivo biodistribution of MSCs. Our results suggest that proper polymer coating can reduce the acute toxicity of MWCNTs to MSCs but without altering their biological fate.",

Carbon nanotubes are composed of inorganic materials, natural biodegradable polymer or synthetic biodegradable polymer. The composite bone tissue engineering scaffolds are constructed by particle-hole method, lyophilization, microsphere aggregation method, electrostatic spinning or three-dimensional printing. Composite scaffolds overcome the shortcomings of single material and have good biocompatibility, osteoconduction and osteoinduction. With the study of surface chemistry, toxicology, and biocompatibility, a degradable \"human-friendly\" carbon nanotubes composite bone tissue scaffold will be available; and under the drive of new fabrication techniques, the clinical application of carbon nanotubes composite bone tissue engineering scaffolds will be better developed.

In this work, we performed a study of capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis in HfO2/InGaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) systems. The charge trapping density estimated from the C-V hysteresis is comparable to or even greater than the typical interface state density in high-k/InGaAs MOS systems. Based on an oxide thickness series, it is demonstrated that the magnitude of C-V hysteresis increases linearly with the increasing HfO2 thickness, with the corresponding density of trapped charge being a constant value over the range of oxide thicknesses, indicating that the charge trapping is occurring in a plane near/at the HfO2/InGaAs interfacial transition region. C-V hysteresis with a hold in accumulation was also investigated. It is observed that the C-V hysteresis has a power law dependence on the stress time in accumulation at the initial stage of stressing and tends to reach a plateau for sufficiently long stress times. Moreover, a larger gate voltage used during the stress increases the oxide field, allowing more border traps to be accessed.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigated the effect of forming gas annealing (FGA, 5% H2/95% N2, 250C to 450C) on border trap density in high-k/InGaAs metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) systems using accumulation frequency dispersion and capacitance-voltage (CV) hysteresis analysis. It is demonstrated that the optimum FGA temperature that reduces the accumulation frequency dispersion is 350C for HfO2/n-InGaAs and 450C for Al2O3/n-InGaAs MOS system. Volume density of border traps (Nbt) is estimated using the accumulation frequency dispersion based on a distributed model for border traps. It is shown that for HfO2/n-InGaAs MOS system, Nbt is reduced from 9.41019cm3eV1 before FGA to 6.31019cm3eV1 following FGA at 350C. For the case of Al2O3/n-InGaAs MOS system, Nbt is reduced from 5.71019cm3eV1 for no FGA to 3.41019cm3eV1 for FGA at 450C. Furthermore, it is shown that the most pronounced reduction in border trap density estimated from CV hysteresis analysis is observed at the same optimum FGA temperature that reduces the accumulation frequency dispersion, indicating that these two techniques for border trap analysis are correlated. Display Omitted Border traps in HfO2/InGaAs and Al2O3/InGaAs MOS structures were studied.Forming gas annealing temperature series was performed.C-V hysteresis and accumulation frequency dispersion were analyzed and compared.C-V hysteresis probes the border traps below the Fermi level.Accumulation frequency dispersion probes border traps at a single energy level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A detailed study of high-efficiency polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a low bandgap polymer PBDTT-F-TT and PC 71 BM as the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer is carried out. By using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as solvent additive to control the morphology of active layer and comparing different device architecture to optimize the optical field distribution, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the resulted devices can be reached as high as 9.34%. Comprehensive characterization and optical modeling of the resulting devices is performed to understand the effect of DIO and device geometry on photovoltaic performance. It was found that the addition of DIO can significantly improve the nanoscale morphology and increased electron mobility in the BHJ layer. The inverted device architecture was chosen because the results from optical modeling shows that it offers better optical field distribution and exciton generation profile. Based on these results, a low-temperature processed ZnO was finally introduced as an electron transport layer to facility the fabrication on flexible substrates and showed comparable performance with the device based on conventional ZnO interlayer prepared by sol-gel process.",

Herein green-emitting CdZnSe ternary NCs, with narrow emission line width of \u223c18\u00a0nm, were synthesized. By combining these green-emitting NCs with blue light-emitting diode and red-emitting CdSe-based NCs a wider color gamut of \u223c136% can be reached, relative to the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) in the 1931 CIE color coordinates space. The influence factors on narrow line width, such as size/morphology distribution and surface state, were investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and time resolved spectrometry. The synthetic conditions of these NCs were discussed also.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenges for the commercialization of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is the difficulty in fabricating a homogeneous and pinhole-free, thin active layer through a large-scale, high-throughput, roll-to-toll manufacturing process. On the other hand, thick active layers in current PSCs generally result in low power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we reported the effect of active layer thickness on the performance of the PSC device based on the state-of-the-art blends of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-uorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2\u20136-diyl)] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The results showed that although the short-circuit current density (JSC) was increased in the device with thicker active layer the PCE was decreased due to the drastically declined fill factor (FF), which offset the improved light absorption from using thicker films.

The working mechanism of reactive blue 13 decolorization in a heterogeneous sono-Fenton system was investigated. Ultrasonic irradiation showed no effect on decolorization when used alone and did not enhance decolorization in the H2O2 system (43.0\u00a0% for H2O2 vs. 48.1\u00a0% for US+H2O2). However, a system with the presence of Fenton-like reagents achieved complete decolorization. Decolorization was greatly accelerated by the addition of ultrasonic irradiation. Thorough decolorization was achieved in 20\u00a0min in the heterogeneous sono-Fenton system, which was 30\u00a0min faster than in the heterogeneous Fenton system. Based on the data collected by microelectrodes, accelerated decomposition of H2O2 was also observed. Ultrasonic irradiation aided the ferrocene catalyst in liberating more \u2022OH from Fenton reactions, leading to the faster decolorization.",

The response value of CoO/SnO sensor is up to 145 at 250\u202f\u00b0C when exposed to 100\u202fppm ethanol gas, which is much higher than that (13.5) of SnO sensor. These good sensing performances mainly attribute to the formation of the CoO/SnO heterojunction, which makes great variation of resistance in air and ethanol gas. Thus, the combination of n-type SnO and p-type CoO provides an effective strategy to design new ethanol gas sensors. The unique nanostructure also played an important role in detecting ethanol, due to its contribution in facilitating the transport rate of the ethanol gas molecules. Also, we provide a general two-step strategy for designing the heterojunction based on the SnO nanostructure.",

The response (resistance ratio) of cobalt oxide and tin oxide composites to 100\u00a0ppm ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) was 201 at 200\u00a0\u00b0C, representing a significant improvement in comparison to tin oxide 3D hierarchical architectures (7.5, correspondingly). The high response of detection of ethanol can be attributed to the change of charge carrier concentration and the variation of oxygen adsorption due to the formation of abundant heterojunction barriers as well as the tuned catalytic activity of Co components, which induce dissociation of ethanol molecule. The unique nanostructure also played an important role in detecting ethanol gas, due to its contribution in facilitating the transport rate and augmenting the adsorption quantity of the target gas molecules.",

The structures and morphologies of the composites were investigated by different kinds of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, field-emission electron scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical workstation and H 2 -TPR technique. Their gas sensing performances of In-Sn oxides composites toward ethanol were investigated using a static system and possible gas-sensing mechanism were investigated. The response (R a /R g ) of In-Sn oxides composites to 100\u00a0ppm ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) was 59.6, which was 7.9 times higher than that of tin oxides at 200\u00a0\u00b0C.

        "abstract": "Pd-doped SnO2 hollow spheres were synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal route. Utilized as the materials in sensors, the 3.0 wt% Pd-doped SnO2 demonstrated more excellent gas-sensing properties towards CO than 1.5 wt% and 4.5 wt% Pd-doped SnO2. Compared with the SnO2 hollow spheres gas sensor, the optimum operating temperature of the Pd-doped SnO2 hollow spheres gas sensor dropped to 200 \u00b0C from 250 \u00b0C; the response value to 100 ppm CO was raised to 14.7 from 2.5 accordingly. Furthermore, the response and recovery times of the 3.0 wt% Pd-doped SnO2 sensor are 5 s and 92 s, respectively, to 100 ppm CO at 200 \u00b0C. It is believed that its enhanced gas-sensing performances are derived from the synergistic interactions between the dispersed Pd and the characteristic configuration of the SnO2 hollow sphere. In addition, theoretical calculations have also been performed with periodic slab models by using density functional theory, which explain well our experimental phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, we present a facile one-step microwave assisted hydrothermal route for the synthesis of the unloaded and Pd-loaded SnO 2  nanostructures. The Pd was grown in situ on the SnO 2  nanostructure, constructing Pd/SnO 2 . A gas sensor based on the as-prepared Pd/SnO 2  was fabricated and tested for response to carbon monoxide gas. The results indicated that the sensor using 3.0\u00a0wt% Pd-loaded SnO 2  to 100\u00a0ppm carbon monoxide performed a superior sensing properties compared to 0\u00a0wt%, 1.5\u00a0wt%, and 4.5\u00a0wt% Pd-loaded samples at a relatively low temperature (100\u00a0\u00b0C). Such enhanced gas sensing performances could be attributed to both the contribution of Pd-loaded and the in situ method. In addition, the one-step in situ microwave assisted loading process provides a promising and versatile choice for the preparation of gas sensing materials.",

However, the research on their thermal properties is still very limited. In this work, Ti3C2Tx films were prepared by the vacuum-assisted filtration of delaminated nano-flake Ti3C2Tx MXenes. The thermal and electrical conductivity of the Ti3C2Tx films were measured by the state-of-the-art T-type method. The results showed that the effective thermal conductivity of the films increased from 1.26 W\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7K\u22121 at 80 K to 2.84 W\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7K\u22121 at 290 K, while the electrical conductivity remained at 12,800 \u03a9\u22121\u00b7m\u22121 for the same temperature range. Thermal resistance model was applied to evaluate the inherent thermal conductivity of the Ti3C2Tx flakes, which was estimated to be in the range of tens to hundreds W\u00b7m\u22121\u00b7K\u22121.",

Compared to the polypropylene (PP) composites filled with pristine BN at the same filler content, thermal conductivity was much higher for those filled with both functionalized BN (f-BN) and maleic anhydride grafted PP (PP-g-ma) due to the improved filler dispersion and better interfacial filler-matrix compatibility, which facilitated the development of more thermal paths. Theoretical models were also applied to predict the composite thermal conductivity in which the Nielsen model was found to fit well with the experimental results, and the estimated effective aspect ratio of fillers well corresponded to the degree of filler aggregation as observed in the morphological study.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Our previous work demonstrated that the amount of residual solvent (RS) content plays an important role in determining the structure and properties of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membranes cast from dimethylacetamide (DMAc). In this work, another three most commonly used solvents during the preparation of proton exchange membranes (PEMs), including dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were employed to prepare SPEEK membranes of different degrees of sulfonation (DSs) with controlled amount of RS content. It was found that the effect of RS content on membrane water uptake is quite universal, as the treated SPEEK membranes of the same DS always showed the same water uptake with the same amount of RS content, regardless of solvent types. Larger RS content always corresponded to the higher water uptake. For SPEEK membranes with relatively high DS, proton conductivity remained almost the same for the treated membranes cast by different solvents when the RS content is the same. While at low DS, the solvent type came into play and also affected the membrane structure and properties: the SPEEK membrane cast by DMSO always exhibited higher proton conductivity than those cast by other solvents with the same RS content. Such phenomena were related to the characteristic structure difference including the size of hydrophilic domains, crystalline structure and polymer chain mobility, which was caused by the different degree of solvent-polymer interaction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The fourth generation of a hydroxylated dendritic hyperbranched polyester (HBP) was combined with sodium montmorillonite clay (Na + MMT) using water to generate a broad range of polymer clay nanocomposites from 0 to 100% wt/wt Na + MMT. Analysis with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed a deviation in heat capacity,  \u0394C   p  , with clay content at the  T   g   from a two-phase trend which was attributed to the formation of an immobilized rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in the interlayer spacing of the intercalated system. This deviation occurred in a step-like fashion which we attributed to 0.5\u00a0nm incremental changes in the interlayer spacing, previously observed through X-ray diffraction analysis. A simple series model was utilized to quantify these interlayer spacings based on the  \u0394C   p   values and showed good correspondence with the X-ray results. The RAF was quantified from changes in heat capacity with clay content and was verified by an alternative novel positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) approach. The PALS quantification of the RAF was possible through an analysis of changes in the hole size thermal expansivity of the nanocomposites as a function of clay composition. Results indicated that as much as 32% by weight of the system is made up of the RAF at its maximum.",

The results show that the dissolution of Si occurs in the Au film surface instead of the Au\u2013Si interface. A mass transfer path inside the Au film is proposed, in which the Si atoms dissolve in the Au film, and then diffuse across the Au lattice, and are oxidized and etched away at the Au film/solution interface. This model is proved by the oxidation products of Si atoms (SiO2 and SiF62\u2212) on the surface of the Au thin film. In addition, the abnormal emission of H2 at the Au\u2013Si interface indicates the probability of the diffusion of H atoms inside the Au film during the etching. This work provides a further insight into the mechanism of metal-assisted chemical etching.",

The microstructure of the three SBR nanocomposites was characterized by XRD, TEM and SEM. After thermal aging, oxygen-containing molecules were found to be formed in the SBR nanocomposites, as verified by FTIR analysis. The SBR/rectorite nanocomposite showed the highest aging coefficient and the lowest change rate of tensile strength and stress at 100% strain among the three SBR nanocomposites, indicating that the introduction of nano-dispersed rectorite layers can enhance the thermal aging resistance of the nanocomposites. For the SBR/CB/rectorite nanocomposite, the addition of CB helped to improve the interfacial compatibility between the filler and matrix, resulting in the best crack resistance as the aged SBR/CB/rectorite nanocomposite always demonstrated the least cracks on the surface during either stretching or bending experiments.",

In this work, vinyl tri-methoxysilane (VTMS) was employed during the preparation of nano-alumina filled silicone rubber (SIR) composites, serving as the molecular bridge between SIR matrix and nano-alumina filler to strengthen the interfacial interaction. Through the reaction with the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups on the nano-alumina surface, VTMS connected the nano-alumina particles with the rubber chains during the curing process, improving the filler-rubber interaction while decreasing the filler-filler interaction. Compared to pristine nano-alumina filled SIR composites, the incorporation of VTMS resulted in better filler dispersion in the as-prepared composites, which exhibited enhancement of thermal conductivity, breakdown strength and mechanical properties, and reduction of dielectric constant and dielectric loss.",

        "abstract": "It is of great importance to improve the proton conductivity of proton exchange membranes by easy-handling and cost-efficient approaches. In this work, we incorporated a commercially obtained surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), into sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) through solution casting to prepare SPEEK/SDBS membranes. When no more than 10 wt % SDBS was added, the SDBS was well dissolved into the SPEEK matrix, and the activation energy for the proton transfer in the SPEEK/SDBS membranes was greatly reduced, leading to significant enhancement of the membrane proton conductivity. Compared with the SPEEK control membrane, the SPEEK/SDBS membrane with 10 wt % SDBS showed a 78% increase in proton conductivity, up from 0.051 S cm to 0.091 S cm, while the water uptake increased from 38% to 62%. Moreover, the SPEEK/SDBS membrane exhibited constant proton conductivity under a long-term water immersion test.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the high aspect ratio, the two-dimensional (2D) inorganic nanofillers have attracted extensive interest in the field of polymer reinforcement. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C\u2083N\u2084) nanosheets were obtained via thermal condensation of melamine and were then ultrasonically exfoliated in water, which was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and TEM. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/g-C\u2083N\u2084 nanocomposites were achieved by solution casting using water as the solvent. The structure and mechanical performance of PVA/g-C\u2083N\u2084 nanocomposites were studied. It was found that the g-C\u2083N\u2084 nanosheets were well dispersed in the PVA matrix. The introduction of g-C\u2083N\u2084 nanosheets increased the glass transition temperature and crystallinity of the nanocomposites, leading to the improved mechanical performance. Compared with the pure PVA, the PVA/g-C\u2083N\u2084 nanocomposite with 0.50 wt% g-C\u2083N\u2084 nanosheets showed ~70.7% enhancement in tensile strength, up from 51.2 MPa to 87.4 MPa.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this work, sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) nanocomposite membranes were prepared with high loading of phosphotungstic acid (HPW) immobilized by polydopamine coated halloysite nanotubes (DHNTs). XPS and FTIR analysis revealed the formation of acid-base interactions between HPW and DHNTs in the nanocomposite membranes, indicating the successful immobilization of HPW on the surface of high aspect-ratio DHNTs, which helped shorten the distance of proton hopping and create more continuous proton transport pathways along the high aspect-ratio nanotubes. The activation energy for the proton transfer in the nanocomposite membranes was greatly reduced and membrane proton conductivity was significantly enhanced. Compared with the SPEEK control membrane, the nanocomposite membrane with 42.9\u202fwt% HPW loading achieved 114% increase in proton conductivity, up from 0.048\u202fS\u202fcm \u22121  to 0.117\u202fS\u202fcm \u22121 , and the membrane water uptake remained almost the same. Under the long term water immersion test, the SPEEK/DHNTs/HPW nanocomposite membrane exhibited much slower decrease in proton conductivity than the SPEEK/HPW membrane without DHNTs, indicating the strong HPW-binding effect from DHNTs on slowing down the leakage of HPW.",

In this study, a novel method named gel compounding method was utilized to prepare acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)/clay nanocomposites via compounding solid rubber with clay gels. As illustrated by TEM and XRD, clay was uniformly dispersed in the NBR matrix as either exfoliated platelets or very thin layered silicate stacks, indicating the separated structure was formed in the NBR/clay nanocomposite prepared by this gel compounding method. Mechanical properties were significantly improved for the NBR/clay nanocomposites, which reached the tensile strength of 12.1\u202fMPa with 10 phr clay, more than 250% higher than that of pure NBR.",

Therefore, solution-proceessable and stable cathode buffer layer is of great importance for the application of PSCs. Here we demonstrate high performance PSCs by employing as-prepared zirconium acetylacetonate (a-ZrAcac) film spin-cast from its ethanol solution as cathode buffer layer. The PSCs based on a low bandgap polymer PBDTBDD as donor and PC60BM as acceptor with a-ZrAcac/Al cathode demonstrated an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.75% which is significantly improved than that of the devices with traditional Ca/Al cathode. The improved photovoltaic performance is benefitted from the decreased series resistance and enhanced light harvest of the PSCs with the a-ZrAcac/Al cathode. The results indicate that a-ZrAcac is a promising high performance cathode buffer layer for fabricating large area flexible PSCs.",

In the proposed study, polyimide films containing different proportions of phenyl thioether were prepared via alternating thermal imidization method and the impact of phenyl thioether contents on the high frequency dielectric loss characteristics investigated. Frequency-domain dielectric spectrum analysis indicated that the dielectric loss of the modified films decreased in the first instance and then roared again with increased phenyl thioether content, among which cases the lowest dielectric loss factor (tan \u03b4 \u202f=\u202f0.000929 at 1\u202fkHz) occurred in the film with phenyl thioether content of 40%. Both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis) measurements, with reactive force field-based molecular dynamics simulation, were utilized to further elucidate the influencing mechanism of phenyl thioether content on dielectric loss characteristics.

        "abstract": "A series of selectively reduced graphite oxide was prepared by thermal reduction of graphite oxide at different annealing temperatures and used as fillers to enhance thermal conductivity of epoxy composites. The reduction degree of selectively reduced graphite oxide increases with annealing temperature changing from 600\u2103 to 1000\u2103. The out-of-plane thermal conductivity (\u039ao) of selectively reduced graphite oxide/epoxy composites is remarkably higher than that of graphite oxide/epoxy. For the selectively reduced graphite oxide obtained at 1000\u2103, \u039ao reaches 0.674\u2009W/m\u00b7K when filler content is 5.4\u2009wt%, which is 450% of pure epoxy. The enhanced \u039ao can be attributed to the better dispersion of selectively reduced graphite oxide in epoxy and their edges overlap to form effective thermal conductive paths in epoxy matrix. However, the achieved thermal conductivity enhancement is still comparatively lower than that of selectively reduced graphite oxide with higher reduction degree, since the interfacial bonding stren...",

        "abstract": "The flooding belief propagation (FO-BP) and the soft-cancelation (SCAN) algorithms are the two most popular soft-output BP algorithms for the decoding of capacity-achieving polar codes. The FO-BP algorithm has high throughput at the cost of performance degradation in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region or with large block length. The SCAN algorithm has much better decoding performance while suffering from long decoding latency and low throughput. In this paper, an improved BP algorithm, named reduced complexity soft-cancelation (RCSC) algorithm, is proposed. Compared with the SCAN algorithm, the number of memory entries required by the RCSC algorithm is reduced by more than 50% in general, while achieving comparable or even better (e.g., when block size $N=2^{15}$ ) decoding performance. When block size is large (e.g., $N\\\\geq 2^{15}$ ), the proposed RCSC algorithm reduces the required memory entries by more than 23% compared with the state-of-the-art FO-BP algorithm. The numerical results show that the error performance improvement of the RCSC algorithm is more significant when the SNR increases. For a different tradeoff, a reduced latency soft-cancelation (RLSC) algorithm is proposed to reduce the decoding latency and increase the throughput of the RCSC algorithm while slightly sacrificing decoding performance. Finally, the optimized VLSI architectures are presented for the RCSC and RLSC algorithms, respectively. The synthesis results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and architectures.",

Large-scale MIMO has been identified as a key technology for the upcoming fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems.

However, the complexity of the MPD algorithm grows with the number of users and the order of modulation, presenting an implementation challenge for a high-order massive MIMO system. Our proposed scheme successfully reduces computational complexity by reducing the number of symbol probability points using in iteration part.

Under the TSMC 90nm CMOS technology, the synthesis results indicate that the SVM classifier using approximate computing can reduces the power-delay product (PDP), area and critical path delay by 32.4%, 18.7% and 16.0%, respectively, compared to the same classifier with accurate computation units.",

        "abstract": "Compared to binary Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, nonbinary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes have better error correction performance under short-to-moderate block lengths or high-order modulations. Traditional min-sum-based soft decoding algorithms for NB-LDPC codes suffer from large computational complexity, which leads to inefficient hardware implementations. The Multiple-symbol-reliability weighted Bit-Reliability-Based (MwBRB) hard decoding algorithm achieves a good tradeoff between error correction performance and decoding complexity. However, efficient hardware implementations based on the MwBRB algorithm have not been investigated. In this brief, an improved layered MwBRB algorithm is first proposed, which results in faster convergence rate than the MwBRB algorithm. Then, an ultra-high-throughput low-complexity decoder architecture with an efficient partially parallel processing schedule is also presented. Finally, the proposed architecture is coded with RTL and synthesized under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology. The synthesis results demonstrate that the proposed decoder for a (837, 726) quasi-cyclic NB-LDPC code over GF(2 5 ) achieves a throughput of 21.66 Gbps and an area efficiency of 4.77 Gbps/M-gates under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology. The proposed decoder reaches a throughput more than 20 Gbps for the first time among the prior NB-LDPC decoders, and the area efficiency is far beyond the state-of-the-art designs.",

        "abstract": "Compared to most of the linear detection algorithms in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the Gauss-Seidel algorithm with initialization (GSI) promises a faster convergence rate. We improve the GSI algorithm by employing the first three items of Taylor expansion to approximate the reciprocals of diagonal entries and using the group inversion to obtain the inversion of the lower triangle matrix, which is feasible and efficient to implement. Simulation results show that the bit error rate performance of the improved GSI algorithm is similar to that of the minimum mean square error equalization for a MIMO system with 128 base station (BS) antennas and eight users. The algorithm can be applied to 64 and 32 BS antennas by employing two and three iterations, respectively. Based on the above improved algorithm, we develop a high-throughput and area-efficient architecture, which is further implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T FPGA. The data are interleaved during the pipeline processing so that we can make the best use of the hardware. The presented architecture can achieve a maximum throughput of 127 Mb/s, which is 2.6 times higher than that of the existing architecture based on the GS algorithm. When ten received vectors are considered at a time, the throughput of the proposed architecture can reach up to 607 Mb/s, and it outperforms the optimized coordinate descent method in terms of resource utilization efficiency (throughput per look-up tables) by two times.",

        "abstract": "Due to the aggressive technology scaling, the memory reliability has been seriously degraded, which poses a challenge to the widely used low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Non-binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes present larger coding gain and lower error floor than their binary counterparts in many cases, which show a great potential to be used in the next-generation memories. However, the excessive computational complexity of current NB-LDPC decoding algorithms form a bottleneck and limit their applications. In this paper, a novel algorithm, called dual-threshold-based shrinking based improved trellis-based min-sum algorithm (simply TIT-MSA), is proposed to deal with this problem. The improvements include two steps. The first step is for the check node processing (CNP). Based on the CNP of the simplified min-sum algorithm (SMSA) and that of the trellis-based extended min-sum algorithm (T-EMSA), an improved trellis-based min-sum algorithm (IT-MSA) is developed, which achieves better error performance and lower computational complexity than its origins. The second step is for the whole decoding process. Based on the IT-MSA, the TIT-MSA is proposed, for which two constant thresholds are introduced to remove redundant messages by constructing two subsets of the Galois field. Simulation results show that the error performance of the TIT-MSA is nearly the same as that of the EMSA. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm can save almost 90% computations compared to the SMSA and T-EMSA.",

In this letter, based on a novel approximate probability updating (APU) scheme, a low complexity MPD (LCMPD) algorithm is proposed. The developed APU scheme considers only the most reliable constellation point during the message passing process.

To accelerate the decoding process, a high throughput list decoder architecture was proposed, which enables the list decoder to partially work in parallel. However, a large sorting space is required in this method and the sorting procedure is relatively time-consuming. In this paper, a hamming distance filter (HDF) algorithm is proposed to reduce sorting complexity during the decoding path pruning. Based on the proposed HDF algorithm, if a path has a large hamming distance (larger than a predefined threshold) between the hard decision of the received LLR and its corresponding constituent code, it is simply discarded. Supposing a HDF aided list decoder is used for an (8192,4096) polar code, simulation results demonstrate that the reduction of the sorting space varies from approximately 36% to 70% with negligible error performance loss.",

Since only the minimum value of a row needs to be sorted out for configuration constructions, the computational complexity of the proposed TEC-TMSA is much lower than that of the TMSA.

Apart from the comparator static offset, a dynamic offset is induced due to the timing skew and bandwidth mismatch between the multiplying digital-to-analog converter and the comparator input paths in the first stage, which brings a serious design challenge. This brief presents a novel background calibration technique for these offsets. First, the comparator\u2019s static offset and dynamic offset are discussed and analyzed. Then, a new evaluation technique is proposed to synchronously extract the values of the static offset and dynamic offset through the residue output at decision points. In this brief, the new calibration method is validated using behavioral models. The effective number of bits is improved from 5.04 bits to 11.96 bits, while the spurious free dynamic range is improved by 50.7 dB from our simulation. Thanks to the background calibration, comparator offset errors exceeding the built-in redundancy of the architecture become acceptable. The proposed method relaxes comparator design requirements effectively. More importantly, the calibration can maximize the input frequency of the SHA-less pipelined ADCs.",

        "abstract": "Current steering digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are well suited for high-resolution, high-speed applications. A serious design challenge is brought by the requirement of solving the setup/hold time violations problem between the output data from the digital clock domain and the analog clock under different process, voltage, and temperature conditions, and simultaneously maintaining high spectral purity of the analog clock. This brief presents a mixed-signal system to detect and correct setup/hold time violations for the critical analog clock in high-speed and high-resolution DACs. A power-efficient, novel 4-bit flash analog-to-digital converter, designed with a new architecture and reference adaptive generation technique while keeping overhead cost low, is proposed in this brief. The detection and correction circuit, together with a 13-bit 2.4-GHz DAC, is implemented in a 0.18-\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\mu }\\text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n CMOS technology. The measured spurious free dynamic range and the output spectrum demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The combined clock phase calibration circuit not only improves the yield of DAC, but also increases the maximum allowable clock frequency for high-resolution DACs, which is especially advantageous for high sampling frequency design.",

        "title": "Accelerating Recurrent Neural Networks: A Memory-Efficient Approach.",
        "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on various sequence learning tasks due to their powerful sequence modeling capability. However, RNNs usually require a large number of parameters and high computational complexity. Hence, it is quite challenging to implement complex RNNs on embedded devices with stringent memory and latency requirement. In this paper, we first present a novel hybrid compression method for a widely used RNN variant, long\u2013short term memory (LSTM), to tackle these implementation challenges. By properly using circulant matrices, forward nonlinear function approximation, and efficient quantization schemes with a retrain-based training strategy, the proposed compression method can reduce more than 95% of memory usage with negligible accuracy loss when verified under language modeling and speech recognition tasks. An efficient scalable parallel hardware architecture is then proposed for the compressed LSTM. With an innovative chessboard division method for matrix\u2013vector multiplications, the parallelism of the proposed hardware architecture can be freely chosen under certain latency requirement. Specifically, for the circulant matrix\u2013vector multiplications employed in the compressed LSTM, the circulant matrices are judiciously reorganized to fit in with the chessboard division and minimize the number of memory accesses required for the matrix multiplications. The proposed architecture is modeled using register transfer language (RTL) and synthesized under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology. With 518.5-kB on-chip memory, we are able to process a    $512 times 512$    compressed LSTM in 1.71    $mu {{{text{s}}}}$   , corresponding to 2.46 TOPS on the uncompressed one, at a cost of 30.77-mm 2  chip area. The implementation results demonstrate that the proposed design can achieve significantly high flexibility and area efficiency, which satisfies many real-time applications on embedded devices. It is worth mentioning that the memory-efficient approach of accelerating LSTM developed in this paper is also applicable to other RNN variants.",

        "abstract": "Non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes exhibit a much better performance than their binary counterparts, especially for moderate codeword length and high-order modulation. However, their decoding algorithms suffer from very high computational complexity. In this paper, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed, named parity-check erased algorithm (PCEA), where an additional parity check bit is added to each symbol of the codeword when encoding and a series of simple operations are performed based on these bits during decoding. As a universal joint coding and decoding algorithm, the PCEA can be combined with arbitrary NB-LDPC encoding schemes and decoding algorithms based on message passing. The proposed algorithm facilitates significant improvement of decoding performance with a small decrease of the code rate. Additionally, it usually has an even better performance than a nearly same-rate code constructed by the original method, and requires much lower decoding complexity due to smaller size of the parity check matrix.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic gradient descent bit-flipping (PGDBF) is the state-of-the-art hard-decision algorithm for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes on binary symmetric channel (BSC). However, there still exists a considerable performance gap between the PGDBF algorithm and soft-decision algorithms, especially in the error-floor region. To bridge this performance gap, a tabu-list aided PGDBF (T-PGDBF) algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the T-PGDBF algorithm, a tabu-list is employed to help the decoding escape from trapping sets, which is the main cause of the error-floor phenomenon. The bits which are flipped in the current iteration will be added to the tabu-list to prevent them being flipped in the next iteration. Simulation results show that the T-PGDBF algorithm offers a significant performance gain when compared to the PGDBF algorithm, which can reach that of soft-decision algorithms. We also present the hardware architecture to implement the T-PGDBF algorithm. Synthesis results show that the improved performance offered by the T-PGDBF algorithm can be obtained with a small hardware overhead.",

However, the existing soft decoding algorithms of NB-LDPC codes generally suffer from high computational complexity. Recently, the trellis-based extended min-sum (T-EMS) decoding algorithm has attracted much attention since it can achieve good decoding performance with high parallelism and low computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two new methods to further reduce the computational complexity and enhance the decoding performance. Firstly, we introduce, with theoretical justification, a universal scheme called threshold-based shrinking (TS) scheme, which facilitates significant reduction of computational complexity for decoding of NB-LDPC codes. Secondly, we present a modified two-extra-column (TEC) scheme and apply it to the T-EMS. Furthermore, a high-performance low-complexity decoding algorithm, named TEC-TEMS algorithm, is obtained. Combining the TS scheme with the TEC-TEMS, the new algorithm, named TS-TEC-TEMS algorithm, achieves much lower computational complexity and has negligible performance loss compared to the TEC-TEMS. For a 256-ary (256, 203) example code, compared to the T-EMS, the computational complexities of the TEC-TEMS and TS-TEC-TEMS algorithms are reduced by more than 50% and nearly 90%, respectively. Moreover, the TEC-TEMS and TS-TEC-TEMS both outperform the T-EMS by about 0.3dB when the frame error rate (FER) is around 10 \u22125 .",

In addition, the dither injection amplitude is configurable for investigating different amplitude\u2019s effects on the linearity of the ADC.

In this paper, based on a lite version of PAQ (LPAQ1) algorithm, an improved LPAQ1 (ILPAQ1) algorithm is presented to reduce the memory usage and improve the throughput at the cost slightly loss in the compression ratio. For the ILPAQ1 algorithm, the tradeoff between compression ratio and memory usage is also investigated based on some typical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a well-optimized VLSI architecture for the predictor part, which dominates the overall complexity of the ILPAQ1 algorithm, is proposed. The predictor architecture is coded in RTL and synthesized under the TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. The implementation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves a throughput of 44.4 Mb/s at 400MHz clock speed, which is 5 times faster than that of the software implementation based on Intel core-i7 4790 CPU at 3.60 GHz.",

Convolutions in CNNs generally dominate the overall computation complexity and thus consume major computational power in real implementations. In this paper, efficient hardware architectures incorporating parallel fast finite impulse response (FIR) algorithm (FFA) for CNN convolution implementations are discussed. The theoretical derivation of 3 and 5 parallel FFAs is presented and the corresponding 3 and 5 parallel fast convolution units (FCUs) are proposed for most commonly used 3 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 5 convolutional kernels in CNNs, respectively. Compared to conventional CNN convolution architectures, the proposed FCUs reduce the number of multiplications used in convolutions significantly. Additionally, the FCUs minimize the number of reads from the feature map memory. Furthermore, a reconfigurable FCU architecture which suits the convolutions of both 3 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 5 kernels is proposed. Based on this, an efficient top-level architecture for processing a complete convolutional layer in a CNN is developed. To quantize the benefits of the proposed FCUs, the design of an FCU is coded with RTL and synthesized with TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. The implementation results demonstrate that 30% and 36% of the computational energy can be saved compared to conventional solutions with 3 \u00d7 3 and 5 \u00d7 5 kernels in CNN, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Binary weight convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) can achieve near state-of-the-art classification accuracy and have far less computation complexity compared with traditional CNNs using high-precision weights. Due to their binary weights, BCNNs are well suited for vision-based Internet-of-Things systems being sensitive to power consumption. BCNNs make it possible to achieve very high throughput with moderate power dissipation. In this paper, an energy-efficient architecture for BCNNs is proposed. It fully exploits the binary weights and other hardware-friendly characteristics of BCNNs. A judicious processing schedule is proposed so that off-chip I/O access is minimized and activations are maximally reused. To significantly reduce the critical path delay, we introduce optimized compressor trees and approximate binary multipliers with two novel compensation schemes. The latter is able to save significant hardware resource, and almost no computation accuracy is compromised. Taking advantage of error resiliency of BCNNs, an innovative approximate adder is developed, which significantly reduces the silicon area and data path delay. Thorough error analysis and extensive experimental results on several data sets show that the approximate adders in the data path cause negligible accuracy loss. Moreover, algorithmic transformations for certain layers of BCNNs and a memory-efficient quantization scheme are incorporated to further reduce the energy cost and on-chip storage requirement. Finally, the proposed BCNN hardware architecture is implemented with the SMIC 130-nm technology. The postlayout results demonstrate that our design can achieve an energy efficiency over 2.0TOp/s/W when scaled to 65 nm, which is more than two times better than the prior art.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have found extensive applications in practice. However, weight/activationu0027s sparsity and different data precision requirements across layers lead to a large amount of redundant computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient architecture for CNNs, named Folded Precision-Adjustable Processor (FPAP), to skip those unnecessary computations with ease. Computations are folded in the following two aspects to achieve efficient computing. On one hand, the dominant multiply-and-add (MAC) operations are performed bit-serially based on a bit-pair encoding algorithm so that the FPAP can adapt to different numerical precisions without using multipliers with long data width. On the other hand, a 1-D convolution is undertaken by a multi-tap transposed finite impulse response (FIR) filter, which is folded into one tap so that computations involving zero activations and weights can be easily skipped. Equipped with the precision-adjustable MAC unit and the folded FIR filter structure, a well-designed array architecture, consisting of many identical processing elements is developed, which is scalable for different throughput requirements and highly flexible for different numerical precisions. Besides, a novel genetic algorithm based kernel reallocation scheme is introduced to mitigate the load imbalance issue. Our synthesis results demonstrate that the proposed FPAP can significantly reduce the logic complexity and the critical path over the corresponding unfolded design, which only delivers slightly higher throughput when processing sparse and compact models. Our experiments also show that FPAP can scale its energy efficiency from 1.01TOP/s/W to 6.26TOP/s/W under 90nm CMOS technology when different data precisions are used.",

        "abstract": "Emerging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tend to be designed with varied per-layer data widths and sparse representations. However, these two features, which bring many redundant computations, have not been exploited simultaneously in existing hardware architectures for CNNs. This paper proposes an energy-quality scalable architecture, namely folded precision-adjustable processor (FPAP), to eliminate all computational redundancies by using folding techniques. On one hand, FPAP decomposes the dominant multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations into multiple adds and folds them into single arithmetic unit. Only effective adds (or part of them) are then calculated serially. Thus, FPAP can adapt to different per-layer data widths and enable precision-adjustable approximate computing. Particularly, FPAP adaptively selects either activation or weight to be decomposed in every single MAC to minimize the total number of adds and clock cycles. On the other hand, a 1-D convolution is undertaken by a multi-tap transposed finite impulse response (FIR) filter, which is folded into one tap to skip MACs with zero weights or activations. Besides, a judicious delay element remapping scheme and a novel genetic algorithm-based kernel reallocation scheme, are developed to reduce the power consumption in a folded FIR filter and mitigate the load imbalance issue caused by irregular sparsity, respectively. With all these optimizations, FPAP is able to reach comparable or even faster processing speed over the corresponding unfolded design in sparse CNNs while consuming smaller area. Experimental results on real CNN models demonstrate that FPAP can scale its energy efficiency from 4.28 to 23.63 TOP/s/W, and area efficiency from 37.79 to 164.15GOP/s/mm 2 , respectively, under the TSMC 28-nm HPC CMOS technology.",

It is necessary that high performance and real time CNN based implementations be realized in local processors. Conventional approaches designing CNN accelerators focus on reducing the computational workload of CNNs. However, the limited external memory bandwidth has become the main bottleneck of CNN acceleration in embedded systems. Because in deep and large CNN models the feature map pixels and weights, which are numerous and must be stored in external memories, need to be exchanged between off-chip and on-chip memories frequently. Hence the performance is constrained by the limited external memory bandwidth. In this paper, bandwidth efficient architectures for CNN implementation are proposed. The intermediate pixel data are stored on chip and kernel weights are transferred in an efficient way. Compared to mainstream CNN implementation methods, the proposed architectures can efficiently utilize external memory bandwidth while preserving the original throughput.",

Numerical analysis shows that the proposed approximate comparator has a lower error rate than the prior approximate comparator, which is demonstrated by the extensive simulations. When implemented under the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 90nm technology, the implementation results show that the proposed approximate comparator is more efficient than the prior approximate comparator in terms of many basic and compound metrics, such as area, delay, power, and energy-delay-error rate product (EDERP).",

        "abstract": "Using regular expressions in intrusion detection systems (IDS) to represent some dangerous payload contents is a more efficient way than using invariant patterns. For each regular expression in regular expressions rules set a unique Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) structure is needed to be converted. It is crucial to implement a fast NFA construction. This paper presents a novel method for compiling large-scale regular expression matching engine (REME) on FPGA. We build an intelligent compiler for automatic converting regular expressions into register-transfer-level (RTL) using Verilog language, utilizing only logic slice available on FPGA because of the simple architecture used in the back-end of our compiler. Due to the independent converting method between the converting flow and the block structure, the compiler can easily change the single pattern structure to build the most advanced regular expression-matching engine (REME) which can fit the realistic demand. On a PC with a 3.3 GHz Intel i5-4590 processor and 4 GB memory, our compiler can convert more than one thousand regular expressions in less than 15 seconds. During the converting flow, the compiler provides an arbitrary match string and corresponding test bench file in Verilog as a part of the final output result.",

        "abstract": "Recently, significant improvement has been achieved for hardware architecture design of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the hardware implementation of one widely used softmax function in DNNs has not been much investigated, which involves expensive division and exponentiation units. This paper performs an efficient hardware implementation of softmax function. Mathematical transformations and linear fitting are used to simplify this function. Multiple algorithmic strength reduction strategies and fast addition methods are employed to optimize the architecture. By using these techniques, complicated logic units like multipliers are eliminated and the memory consumption is largely reduced while the accuracy loss is negligible. The proposed design is coded using hardware description language (HDL) and synthesized under the TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology. Synthesis results show that the architecture achieves a throughput of 6.976 G/s for 8-bit input data. The power efficiency of 463.04 Gb/(mm 2 \u2022 mW) is achieved and it costs only 0.015mm 2  area resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on efficient hardware implementation for softmax in open literature.",

        "abstract": "Due to the intensive computational complexity and various types of convolution, it is a challange to implement different CNN models on a specific hardware. Many previous works focus on data reuse and sparsity exploration to accelerate computation but fail to support various types of convolution efficiently. When dealing with variants of conventional convolution, such as deconvolution or dilated convolution, previous accelerators waste time on padding zeroes and convolving with padded feature maps. In this paper, we propose a unified convolution algorithm to intelligently combine several convolution types together and exploit the sparsity in activations. The padding process can be skipped by the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a unified systolic convolution array (USCA) architecture is developed based on the algorithm. The USCA architecture is implemented with a TSMC 28nm CMOS technology. The implementation results demonstrate that the architecture costs 206k logic gates and 114.7kB on-chip memory. It can reach a peak performance of 374.7GOPs and comsumes 201.1mW at a frequency of 1449MHz. Compared to similar works, USCA architecture achieves 3 \u00d7 energy efficiency, which is measured by the number of GOPS per watt. Besides, to the best of our knowledge, USCA is the first architecture that can simultaneously support conventional convolution, deconvolution, and dilated convolution in an efficient way.",

Recent discovery of a novel mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, from people and food animals has caused a significant public health concern and drawn worldwide attention. Extensive usage of colistin in food animals has been proposed as a major driving force for the emergence and transmission of mcr-1; thus, there is a worldwide trend to limit colistin usage in animal production. However, despite lack of colistin usage in food animals in the USA, mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli isolates were still isolated from swine. In this paper, we provided an overview of colistin usage and epidemiology of mcr-1 in food animals, and summarized the current status of mechanistic and evolutionary studies of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance. Based on published information, we further discussed several non-colistin usage risk factors that may contribute to the persistence, transmission, and emergence of colistin resistance in an animal production system. Filling the knowledge gaps identified in this review is critical for risk assessment and risk management of colistin resistance, which will facilitate proactive and effective strategies to mitigate colistin resistance in future animal production systems.",

It also has been widely accepted that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurs everywhere and plays a critical role in the transmission of AR genes among bacteria. However, our understanding of HGT processes primarily build on extensive in vitro studies; to date, there is still a significant knowledge gap regarding in situ HGT events as well as the factors that influence HGT in different ecological niches. This review is focused on the HGT process in the intestinal tract, a 'melting pot' for gene exchange. Several factors that potentially influence in vivo HGT efficiency in the intestine are identified and summarized, which include SOS-inducing agents, stress hormones, microbiota and microbiota-derived factors. We highlight recent discoveries demonstrating that certain antibiotics, which are widely used in animal industry, can enhance HGT in the intestine by serving as DNA-damaging, SOS-inducing agents. Despite recent progress, research on in vivo HGT events is still in its infancy. A better understanding of the factors influencing HGT in the intestine is highly warranted for developing effective strategies to mitigate AR in animal production as well as in future agricultural ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "Extensive use of colistin in food animals is deemed a major driving force for the emergence and transmission of  However, a non-colistin usage factor(s) contributing to mobile colistin resistance may also exist in animal production systems. Given that polymyxin, a bacterium-derived peptide antibiotic, has been successfully used as a surrogate to study bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), acquisition of MCR-1 may confer cross-resistance to the unrelated AMPs implicated in practical applications. To test this, we first constructed  recombinant strains differing only in the presence or absence of functional MCR-1. Among diverse tested AMPs, MCR-1 was observed to confer cross-resistance to bacitracin, an in-feed antibiotic widely used in animal industry. The significantly (2-fold) increased bacitracin MIC was confirmed by using different bacitracin products, broth media, and laboratory host strains for susceptibility tests. Subsequently, an original  gene-bearing plasmid, pSLy21, was conjugatively transferred to eight clinical  recipient strains isolated from diarrheic pigs, which also led to significantly increased MICs of both colistin (4-fold to 8-fold) and bacitracin (2-fold). Growth curve examination further demonstrated that MCR-1 provides a growth advantage to various  strains in the presence of bacitracin. Given that bacitracin, a feed additive displaying low absorption in the intestine, can be used in food animals with no withdrawal required, imprudent use of bacitracin in food animals may serve as a risk factor to enhance the ecological fitness of MCR-1-positive  strains, consequently facilitating the persistence and transmission of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in agricultural ecosystem. Polymyxins (e.g., colistin) are the drugs of last resort to treat multidrug-resistant infections in humans. To control mobile colistin resistance, there is a worldwide trend to limit colistin use in animal production. However, simply limiting colistin use in animal production may still not effectively mitigate colistin resistance due to an overlooked non-colistin usage factor(s). Using controlled systems, in this study, we observed that MCR-1 confers cross-resistance to bacitracin, a popular in-feed antibiotic used in food animals. Thus, imprudent and extensive usage of bacitracin in food animals may serve as a non-colistin usage risk factor for the transmissible colistin resistance. Further comprehensive  and  studies are highly warranted to generate science-based information for risk assessment and risk management of colistin resistance, consequently facilitating the development of proactive and effective strategies to mitigate colistin resistance in animal production system and protect public health.",

        "abstract": " The mobile colistin resistance gene  is a serious threat to global human and animal health. The composite transposon Tn and its circular intermediate were proposed to be involved in the spread of  but their roles remain poorly understood.  To further explore the intermediates during the transposition of Tn, we engineered  strains that carry an intact Tn transposon or its deletion derivatives. PCR assays were performed to detect IR-IR junctions and possible circular intermediates. We carried out transposition experiments to calculate transposition frequency. The transposition sites were characterized by whole genome sequence and ISMapper-based analyses.  The presence of an intact Tn was demonstrated to be essential for the successful transposition of , although both Tn and Tn-\u0394IR could form circular intermediates. The insertion sequence junction structure was observed in all constructed plasmids but the IS dimer was only formed in one construct containing an intact Tn. The average frequency of  transposition in an  strain possessing an intact Tn was \u223c10 per transformed cell. We identified 27 integration sites for the Tn transposition event. All the transposition sites were flanked by 2 bp target duplications and preferentially occurred in AT-rich regions.  These results indicate that  transposition relies on the presence of an intact Tn. In addition, formation of the tandem repeat IS  could represent a crucial intermediate.

        "abstract": "Campylobacter is the leading bacterial cause of human enteritis in developed countries. Human campylobacteriosis is commonly associated with the consumption of undercooked, contaminated chicken, a natural host of Campylobacter. Thus, the control of Campylobacter colonization in poultry at the farm level would reduce the risk of human exposure to this pathogen. Vaccination is an attractive intervention measure to mitigate Campylobacter in poultry. Our recent studies have demonstrated that the outer-membrane proteins CmeC (an essential component of CmeABC multidrug efflux pump) and CfrA (ferric enterobactin receptor) are feasible candidates for immune intervention against Campylobacter. By targeting these two promising vaccine candidates, live attenuated Salmonella-vectored vaccines were developed and evaluated in this study. Briefly, the cfrA and cmeC genes were cloned into expression vector pYA3493 and transferred into Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium \u03c78914, the USDA licensed live attenuated vaccine strain. The oral live Salmonella vaccines producing CfrA or CmeC (truncated or full length) were successfully constructed by using delicate molecular manipulation despite the challenge due to the potential toxic effect of the cloned gene product in the Escherichia coli host. Expression and membrane localization of the target protein in the vaccines were confirmed by immunoblotting. The efficacies of the two live vaccines that produce full-length CfrA or CmeC were evaluated by using broiler chickens. However, oral vaccination of chickens failed to trigger significant systemic and intestinal mucosal immune responses and, consequently, did not confer protection against Campylobacter jejuni colonization chickens. The vaccination regimens of the constructed live Salmonella-vectored vaccine need to be optimized in future studies.",

Furthermore, the detection of iam in C. jejuni isolated from two important hosts, humans and chickens, suggested a role for this marker in C. jejuni's colonization of multiple hosts. However, no data exist regarding the occurrence of this marker in C. jejuni isolated from non-poultry food-animals such as cattle, an increasingly important source for human infections. Since little is known about the genetics associated with C. jejuni's capability for colonizing physiologically disparate hosts, we investigated the occurrence of the iam in C. jejuni isolated from cattle and assessed the potential of iam-containing cattle and human isolates for chicken colonization and human cell invasion.Simultaneous RAPD typing and iam-specific PCR analysis of 129 C. jejuni isolated from 1171 cattle fecal samples showed that 8 (6.2%) of the isolates were iam-positive, while 7 (54%) of human-associated isolates were iam-positive. The iam sequences were mostly heterogeneous and occurred in diverse genetic backgrounds. All iam-positive isolates were motile and possessed important genes (cadF, ciaB, cdtB) associated with adhesion and virulence. Although certain iam-containing isolates invaded and survived in INT-407 cells in high numbers and successfully colonized live chickens, there was no clear association between the occurrence, allelic sequence, and expression levels of the iam and the aforementioned phenotypes.We show that the prevalence of iam in cattle C. jejuni is relatively lower as compared to isolates occurring in humans and chickens. In addition, iam was polymorphic and certain alleles occur in cattle isolates that were capable of colonizing and invading chickens and human intestinal cells, respectively. However, the iam did not appear to contribute to the cattle-associated C. jejuni's potential for invasion and intracellular survival in human intestinal cells as well as chicken colonization.",

Despite prevalent \u03b2-lactam resistance in Campylobacter jejuni, the leading bacterial cause of human diarrhea in developed countries, molecular mechanism of \u03b2-lactam resistance in C. jejuni is still largely unknown. In this study, C. jejuni 81-176 was used for random transposon mutagenesis. Screening of a 2,800-mutant library identified 22 mutants with increased susceptibility to ampicillin. Of these mutants, two mutants contains mutations in Cj0843c (a putative lytic transglycosylase gene) and in its upstream gene Cj0844c, respectively. Complementation experiment demonstrated that the Cj0843 contributes to \u03b2-lactam resistance. The Cj0843c insertional mutation was subsequently introduced to diverse C. jejuni clinical strains for MIC test, showing that Cj0843c contributes to both intrinsic and acquired \u03b2-lactam resistance of C. jejuni. Consistent with this finding, inactivation of Cj0843c also dramatically reduced \u03b2-lactamase activity. Genomic examination and PCR analysis showed Cj0843c is widely distributed in C. jejuni. High purity recombinant Cj0843c was produced for generation of specific antiserum. The Cj0843 was localized in the periplasm, as demonstrated by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Turbidimetric assay further demonstrated the capability of the purified Cj0843c to hydrolyze cell walls. Inactivation of Cj0843c also significantly reduced C. jejuni colonization in the intestine. Together, this study identifies a mechanism of \u03b2-lactam resistance in C. jejuni and provides insights into the role of cell wall metabolism in regulating \u03b2-lactamase activity.",

        "abstract": "Upon colonization in the host gastrointestinal tract, the enteric bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is exposed to a variety of signaling molecules including the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE). NE has been observed to stimulate the growth and potentially enhance the pathogenicity of C. jejuni. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. In this study, both Epi and NE were also observed to promote C. jejuni growth in MEM\u03b1-based iron-restricted medium. Adhesion and invasion of Caco-2 cells by C. jejuni were also enhanced upon exposure to Epi or NE. To further examine the effect of Epi or NE on the pathobiology of C. jejuni, transcriptomic profiles were conducted for C. jejuni NCTC 11168 that was cultured in iron-restricted medium supplemented with Epi or NE. Compared to the genes expressed in the absence of the catecholamine hormones, 183 and 156 genes were differentially expressed in C. jejuni NCTC 11168 that was grown in the presence of Epi and NE, respectively. Of these differentially expressed genes, 102 genes were common for both Epi and NE treatments. The genes differentially expressed by Epi or NE are involved in diverse cellular functions including iron uptake, motility, virulence, oxidative stress response, nitrosative stress tolerance, enzyme metabolism, DNA repair and metabolism and ribosomal protein biosynthesis. The transcriptome analysis indicated that Epi and NE have similar effects on the gene expression of C. jejuni, and provided insights into the delicate interaction between C. jejuni and intestinal stress hormones in the host.

        "abstract": "Iron acquisition systems are critical for bacterial pathogenesis and thus have been proposed as attractive targets for iron-dependent pathogen control. Of these systems, high-affinity iron acquisition mediated by siderophore, a small iron chelator, is the most efficient iron-scavenging mechanism in gram-negative bacteria. Campylobacter does not produce any siderophores but has the ability to utilize exogenous siderophores. In particular, the enterobactin (Ent)-mediated iron scavenging is tightly linked to Campylobacter pathogenesis. To date, Ent, a triscatecholate with the highest known affinity for ferric iron, is a well-characterized siderophore used by Campylobacter for iron acquisition during in vivo infection. Here, we describe the key methods used to characterize Ent-mediated high affinity iron acquisition system in Campylobacter jejuni.",

        "abstract": "The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from Campylobacter jejuni with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of E. coli SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.",

The case presents that a 63-year-old female patient suffering from back pain, has received vertebroplasty four times to achieve pain relief, including total fourteen vertebrae. Retrospectively, it is choosing improper vertebrae to be treated that fails to relieve pain repeatedly. We come up with the term of painful responsible vertebrae which cause back pain in OVCFs, and illustrate clinical evidence of imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, to locate painful responsible vertebrae preoperatively.

However, a moderately soft and painful 200 \u00d7 100 mm mass of the posterior thigh, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed an inhomogeneously hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), was found forty days after the operation. Two years into follow-up, we intend to judge whether the tumor relapses by regular imaging examination including thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans and local MRI scans of lower extremities. The diagnosis of postoperative cyst is suggested. ",

To the best of our knowledge, no cases of primary bone MCL with multiple vertebral compression fractures have been reported in the literature thus far. The current study reports the case of a 75-year-old Chinese male patient presenting with lower back pain for 1 year. B symptoms were not observed in the patient's medical history. X-ray revealed osteoporosis, and mixed osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions in the T10 and L1 vertebrae with decreased height. Computed tomography of the spine showed multiple vertebral compression fractures, particularly at T10 and L1. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a diffuse homogeneous abnormal signal with multiple vertebral compression fractures. The patient underwent vertebral biopsy and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty. Histopathological examination of the biopsy revealed abnormal, diffuse, atypical, small-sized, slightly irregular lymphocytes with condensed chromatin. Immunohistochemical staining showed CD5, CD20 and cyclin D1. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with primary bone MCLs and chemotherapy was administered. During the 2-month follow-up, the patient remained in a good clinical condition. The present study reports a rare case of primary osseous MCL and a review of the literature.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The definition of a vertebral fracture is usually based on the presence of a deformation of the vertebral body and this can be misleading in the presence of a fracture without radiologic collapse with the definition of occult osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OOVFs). STIR sequence of MRI images showing hyperintensity signal was the most confirmative screening examination used to determine the presence of painful OOVFs. To date, clinical management of OOVFs has been rarely discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2011 and 2013, 89 patients suffering from painful OOVFs underwent 142 percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) procedures. Outcome data (mean variation of anterior and middle vertebral body height, visual analog scale [VAS] scores, Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] scores, and SF-36 scores) were recorded preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 2 year after treatment, to evaluate the results. RESULTS We successfully treated 89 patients (142 vertebral bodies) with PKP. Cement leakages were observed in 12 (8.45%) treated vertebral bodies and there were 5 new adjacent vertebral fractures during the follow-up period. The mean variation of anterior and middle vertebral body height changed from 96.5\u00b13.4% preoperatively to 97.2\u00b12.5% postoperatively (p>0.05) and from 96.3\u00b12.8% preoperatively to 97.9\u00b13.1% postoperatively (p>0.05), respectively. The mean VAS scores were reduced significantly from pre-surgery to post-surgery (8.3\u00b11.2 to 2.9\u00b10.7; p<0.05), as was the ODI score (76.4\u00b112.5 to 26.7\u00b15.6; p<0.05). The SF-36 scores, including Bodily Pain (BF), Vitality (VT), Physical Function (PF), and Social Functioning (SF), all showed notable improvement (P<0.05). These variations were maintained during the 2-year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS PKP is a safe and effective method in the treatment of painful OOVFs.",

        "abstract": "Degenerative disc degeneration (DDD) is the major cause of low back pain, which seriously affects the life of patients. Current surgical and conservative treatments only relieve the pain temporarily, yet fail to restore the normal biomechanics and functions of healthy spine. Indeed, high recurrence of disc herniation commonly happens after discectomy. Degenerative changes in biomechanical and structural properties of the intervertebral disc (IVD), including fissures in annulus fibrosus (AF) and volume loss of nucleus pulposus (NP), mainly contribute to DDD development. AF plays a critical role in the biomechanical properties of IVD as it structural integrity is essential to confine NP and maintain physiological intradiscal pressure under loading. Maintaining the homeostasis of AF and NP, and thereby IVD, requires regulation of their biomechanics, which is also involved in the onset and subsequent development of AF degeneration. Therefore, it is essential to understand the biomechanical changes of AF during degeneration, which can also provide valuable insights into the repair and regeneration of AF. In this review, we focus on the biomechanical properties of AF tissue associated with its homeostasis and degeneration, and discuss the biomechanical stimulus required for regeneration of AF. We also provide an overview of recent strategies to target and modulate cell mechanics toward AF regeneration.",

        "abstract": "Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is the major cause of back pain. Notch signaling is activated in annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues of degenerated IVDs, and induced by IL1-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in NP cells. However, the role of Notch activatin in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration is largely unknown. In this study, we overexpressed the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1) in AF, NP, and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells via adenoviruses. Overexpression of NICD1 activated transcription of Notch signaling target genes in AF, NP, and ATDC5 cells, and caused cell type-specific effects on expression of matrix anabolic and catabolic genes. Activation of Notch signaling promoted expression of matrix catabolic genes and inhibited expression of matrix anabolic genes in both AF and ATDC5 cells, whereas its activation suppressed expression of matrix catabolic genes (including Mmp3, Mmp13, Adamts4, and Adamts5) and attenuated TNF-\u03b1 and inflammatory macrophage-induced Mmp13 expression in NP cells. Consistently, sustained activation of Notch1 signaling in postnatal IVDs in mice severely disrupted growth plate and endplate cartilage tissues, but did not overly affect NP tissues. Together, these data indicated that activation of Notch signaling exerted differential and cell type-specific effects in intervertebral discs, and specific Notch signaling regulation may be considered during the treatment of IVD degeneration.",

        "abstract": "Lanthanide-based nanoparticles (LNs) hold great promise in medicine. A variety of nanocrystals, including LNs, elicits potent inflammatory response through activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. We have previously identified an LNs-specific surface coating peptide RE-1, with the sequence of \u2018ACTARSPWICG\u2019, which reduced nanocrystal-cell interaction and abrogated LNs-induced autophagy and toxicity in both HeLa cells and liver hepatocytes. Here we show that RE-1 coating effectively inhibited LNs-induced inflammasome activation, mostly mediated by NLRP3, in mouse bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDM) cells, human THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages and also reduced LNs-elicited inflammatory response in vivo. RE-1 coating had no effect on cellular internalization of LNs in BMDM cells, in contrast to the situation in HeLa cells where cell uptake of LNs was significantly inhibited by RE-1. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the inflammasome-inhibiting effect of RE-1, we assessed several parameters known to influence nanocrystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. RE-1 coating did not reduce potassium efflux, which occurred after LNs treatment in BMDM cells and was necessary but insufficient for LNs-induced inflammasome activation. RE-1 did decrease lysosomal damage induced by LNs, but the inhibitor of cathepsin B did not affect LNs-elicited caspase 1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 release, suggesting that lysosomal damage was not critically important for LNs-induced inflammasome activation. On the other hand, LNs-induced elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), critically important for inflammasome activation, was largely abolished by RE-1 coating, with the reduction on NADPH oxidase-generated ROS playing a more prominent role for RE-1's inflammasome-inhibiting effect than the reduction on mitochondria-generated ROS. ROS generation further triggered Ca2+ influx, an event that was mediated by Transient Receptor Potential M2 (TRPM2) and was necessary for inflammasome activation, and this event was completely inhibited by RE-1 coating. We conclude from these studies that inhibition of ROS production, and the subsequent abrogation of TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx, is the primary mechanism underlying RE-1's inhibitory effect on LNs-induced inflammasome activation. The ability of regulating the inflammatory response of nanocrystals through peptide surface coating may be of great value for in vivo applications of LNs and other engineered nanomaterials.",

Here, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)-induced cytoprotective autophagy required TFEB is shown. Ag NPs-induced nucleus translocation of TFEB through a well-established mechanism involving dephosphorylation of TFEB at serine-142 and serine-211 but independent of both the mTORC1 and ERK1/2 pathways. TFEB nucleus translocation precedes autophagy induced by Ag NPs and leads to enhanced expression of autophagy-essential genes. Knocking down the expression of TFEB attenuates the autophagy induction is demonstrated, and in the meantime, enhanced cell killing in HeLa cells treats with Ag NPs, indicating that TFEB is the key mediator for Ag NPs-induced cytoprotective autophagy. The results pinpoint TFEB as a potential target for developing more effective Ag NPs-based cancer therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "The possible adverse effects of engineered nanomaterials on human health raise increasing concern as our research on nanosafety intensifies. Upon entry into a human body, whether intended for a theranostic purpose or through unintended exposure, nanomaterials tend to accumulate in the liver, leading to hepatic damage. A variety of nanoparticles, including rare earth upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs), have been reported to elicit hepatotoxicity, in most cases through inducing immune response or activating reactive oxygen species. Many of these nanoparticles also induce autophagy, and autophagy inhibition has been shown to decrease UCN-induced liver damage. Herein, using UCNs as a model engineered nanomaterial, this study uncovers a critical role for Kupffer cells in nanomaterial-induced liver toxicity, as depletion of Kupffer cells significantly exacerbates UCN-induced liver injury. Furthermore, UCN-induced prodeath autophagy in Kupffer cells, and inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA, a well-established chemical inhibitor of autophagy, enhances Kupffer cell survival and further abrogates UCN-induced liver toxicity. The results reveal the critical importance of Kupffer cell autophagy for nanoparticle-induced liver damage, and inhibition of autophagy may constitute a novel strategy for abrogating nanomaterial-elicited liver toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Many of the neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) are caused by the accumulation of intracytoplasmic aggregate-prone proteins. These toxic protein aggregates are mainly degraded by autophagy, thus elevating the autophagy level to enhance the degradation of these proteins representing an emerging viable approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this report we showed that graphene oxide (GO), an engineered nanomaterial with enormous potential in biomedical applications, effectively enhanced the clearance of mutant huntingtin (Htt), the aggregate-prone protein underlying the pathogenesis of HD. This enhancing effect of GO was autophagy-mediated, as blocking autophagy by chemical inhibitors at either the autophagosome formation stage or the autophagosome-lysosome fusion stage, or more specifically by knocking-down an essential autophagy gene, led to a significant reduction in the ability of GO to elicit Htt degradation. Interestingly, the autophagy induced by GO had the normal capacity to degrade its cargo including LC3-II and Htt, but not p62/SQSTM1 (p62), and was dependent on the activation of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways, without mTOR involvement. GO also increased ubiquitination of Htt, an event necessary for Htt's clearance. Furthermore, ubiquitinated huntingtin protein preferentially binds to GO, and abundant GO was found in autophagosomes and autolysosomes, thus raising the possibility that GO may directly deliver the bound protein to autophagosomes for degradation. Our results revealed a novel biological function of GO and may have implications for developing nanomaterial-based therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Here we show that a type of copper (Cu)-palladium (Pd) alloy tetrapod nanoparticles (TNP-1) presents an ideal solution to the chemo-PTT challenges. TNP-1 exhibit superior near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency, thanks to their special sharp-tip structure, and induce pro-survival autophagy in a shape- and composition-dependent manner. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyl adenine or chloroquine has a remarkable synergistic effect on TNP-1-mediated PTT in triple-negative (4T1), drug-resistant (MCF7/MDR) and patient-derived breast cancer models, achieving a level of efficacy unattainable with TNP-2, the identically-shaped CuPd nanoparticles that have a higher photothermal conversion efficiency but no autophagy-inducing activity. Our results provide a proof-of-concept for a chemo-PTT strategy, which utilizes autophagy inhibitors instead of traditional chemotherapeutic agents and is particularly useful for eradicating drug-resistant cancer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The diverse biological effects of nanomaterials form the basis for their applications in biomedicine but also cause safety issues. Induction of autophagy is a cellular response after nanoparticles exposure. It may be beneficial in some circumstances, yet autophagy-mediated toxicity raises an alarming concern. Previously, it has been reported that upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs) elicit liver damage, with autophagy contributing most of this toxicity. However, the detailed mechanism is unclear. This study reveals persistent presence of enlarged autolysosomes in hepatocytes after exposure to UCNs and SiO2 nanoparticles both in vitro and in vivo. This phenomenon is due to anomaly in the autophagy termination process named autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) relocates onto autolysosome membrane, which is a key event of ALR. PI(4)P is then converted into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 ) by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase. Clathrin is subsequently recruited by PI(4,5)P2 and leads to tubule budding of ALR. Yet it is observed that PI(4)P cannot be converted in nanoparticle-treated hepatocytes cells. Exogenous supplement of PI(4,5)P2 suppresses the enlarged autolysosomes in vitro. Abolishment of these enlarged autolysosomes by autophagy inhibitor relieves the hepatotoxicity of UCNs in vivo. The results provide evidence for disrupted ALR in nanoparticle-treated hepatocytes, suggesting that the termination of nanoparticle-induced autophagy is of equal importance as the initiation.",

We also found that cell protective autophagy could be induced by AgNPs and/or radiation, which was verified by the use of 3-MA. The mechanism through which had autophagy and the enhancement of radiosensitivity taken place was further investigated with inhibitors of ERK and JNK pathways. We demonstrated that ERK and JNK played pivotal roles in the radiosensitivity enhancement. Inhibiting ERK and JNK with U0126 and SP600125 respectively, we found that the autophagy level of the cells treated with AgNPs and radiation were attenuated. Moreover, SP600125 down-regulated the apoptosis rate of the co-treated cells significantly.

        "abstract": "Autophagy may represent a common cellular response to nanomaterials. In the present study, it was demonstrated that zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZON)-elicited autophagy contributes to tumor cell killing by accelerating the intracellular dissolution of ZONs and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In particular, ZONs could promote Atg5-regulated autophagy flux without the impairment of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, which is responsible for ZON-elicited cell death in cancer cells. On the other hand, a further study revealed that a significant free zinc ion release in lysosomal acid compartments and sequential ROS generation in cells treated with ZONs were also associated with tumor cytotoxicity. Intriguingly, the colocalization between FITC-labeled ZONs and autophagic vacuoles indicates that the intracellular fate of ZONs is associated with autophagy. Moreover, the chemical or genetic inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the level of intracellular zinc ion release and ROS generation separately, demonstrating that ZON-induced autophagy contributed toward cancer cell death by accelerating zinc ion release and sequentially increasing intracellular ROS generation. The modulation of autophagy holds great promise for improving the efficacy of tumor chemotherapy. Herein, ZONs were verified to enhance chemotherapy in both normal and drug-resistant cancer cells via synergistic autophagy elicitation. Further, this elicitation resulted in tremendous zinc ion release and ROS generation, which accounted for enhancing the tumor chemotherapy and overcoming drug resistance. No obvious changes in the expression level of P-gp proteins or the amount of doxorubicin uptake induced by ZONs in MCF-7/ADR cells also indicated that the increased zinc ion release and ROS generation via synergistic autophagy induction were responsible for overcoming the drug resistance. Finally, in vivo experiments involving animal models of 4T1 tumor cells revealed that the antitumor therapeutic effect of a combinatory administration obviously outperformed those of ZONs or free doxorubicin treatment alone at the same dose, which could be attenuated by the autophagy inhibitor wortmannin or ion-chelating agent EDTA. Taken together, our results reveal the mechanism wherein the autophagy induction by ZONs potentiates cancer cell death and a novel biological application for ZONs in adjunct chemotherapy in which autophagy reinforces zinc ion release and ROS generation.",

Whether MLCK is involved in the endocytosis of nanoparticles (NPs) has not been reported yet. NPs attract interest in many fields; most of them can induce autophagy and cytotoxicity after entering cells via endocytosis. In this study, we found that MLCK inhibitors, ML-7 and ML-9, abolished the endocytosis of silver NPs and yttrium oxide NPs in HeLa cells, and subsequently attenuated the autophagy induction and cytotoxicity caused by the NPs treatment. This is the first report that MLCK inhibitors acted as an endocytosis inhibitor and abolished the cell entry of NPs, which provided a new method for inhibiting the endocytosis of NPs.",

Both of them possess paramagnetic and fluorescent properties, and their excellent cyto-compatibility and low haemolysis are further confirmed. Therefore, they could act as dual mode contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, YEG and YTG mesospindles induce dose and time dependent autophagy by activating the PI3K signaling pathway. The autophagy induced by YEG and YTG mesocrystals is confirmed by enhanced autophagosome formation, normal cargo degradation, and no disruption of lysosomal function. This work is important to illustrate how rare-earth mesocrystals affect the autophagic pathway, indicating the potential of the YEG and YTG mesospindles in diagnosis and therapy. ",

        "abstract": "In this study, we have fabricated crystalline metallic Pt nanoparticles-loaded \u03b1-BiO microrods (Pt/BiO) using a precipitation method, followed by an impregnation-reduction deposition route. The Pt/BiO catalysts have much higher photocatalytic activities than that of the pure BiO for the degradation of RhB and 2,4-DCP under visible light irradiation. The photogenerated charge separation, transfer, and capture in the photocatalysis of Pt/BiO were investigated in detail according to the various characterizations and analyses of the photogenerated active species and HO. It was revealed that the loaded Pt plays an important mediating role in the efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs by rapidly transferring electrons from the excited BiO to the surface oxygen. As a result, the reduction of O to form HO by the photogenerated electrons was promoted, leaving more holes on the deep valence band to drive the degradation of organic compounds and the production of \u02d9OH radicals, which were responsible for the enhanced photocatalysis of Pt/BiO.",

It was clearly revealed that both the cubic CdS substrate and structure of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets play critical roles in the observed efficient H2 evolution. The cubic CdS offers a strong adherence for ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets to form a well contact interface, across which the photogenerated charge transfer and charge separation are achieved.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, oxygen vacancy-rich ultrathin 2D nanosheets NiO were assembled onto 1D nanorod CdS by a facile solvothermal method for photocatalytic H 2  evolution. NiO/CdS with a hierarchical structure exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic activity, the H 2  evolution rate of which is as much as 43\u202fmmol/g/h under visible light. According to various characterization results, photocatalytic mechanism about charge transfer process was proposed. Density functional calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies introduce a defect level in the bandgap of NiO, resulting an increased visible light absorption. Furthermore, the formed heterojunction in NiO/CdS efficiently separates the photogenerated holes and electrons, which enhances the photocatalytic activities. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out to illustrate the existence of oxygen defect. And the mechanism is proposed based on the concentration of Cd 2+  ions after photocatalytic reaction. This study paves a new way to design highly efficient heterostructures rationally for photocatalytic H 2  evolution.",

        "abstract": "Noble metal Pt is one of not only the most effective cocatalysts in hydrogen evolution, but also the most widely used reference cocatalysts in the development of non-noble metal cocatalysts. The efficient and optimum use of noble metal Pt as a cocatalyst is of great significance. In this work, we demonstrated a rapid and facile sonochemical approach to the deposition of Pt on CdS nanorods with H2PtCl6 as a precursor in an aqueous solution of methanol, which was achieved by the ultrasonic irradiation in an ultrasonic cleaning bath. The resulting Pt-deposited CdS (Pt/CdS) exhibits remarkably high efficiency for hydrogen evolution from water splitting, with a highest H2 evolution rate of 24.15 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121 over 0.5 wt% Pt/CdS. Various characterizations revealed that the ultrasonic irradiation can effectively drive the completion reduction of Pt4+ in the precursor (H2PtCl6), and the tight adherence of the resulting ultrafine metallic Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 1.75 nm to the surface of CdS nanorods, both of which would contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution. This work, we believe, offers a simple but effective approach to the deposition of noble metal Pt as an efficient cocatalyst on CdS for high photocatalytic H2 evolution.",

The ultrasonic irradiation of a suspension of CdS nanowires and (NH 4 ) 2 MoS 4  in an aqueous solution of ethanol for 30\u202fmin yielded a MoS 2  nanosheets-deposited CdS composite (MoS 2 /CdS). The resulting MoS 2 /CdS has been shown to significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance for H 2  evolution compared to pure CdS. Various characterization results reveal that the MoS 2  nanosheets deposited on CdS by the ultrasound-driven route are short-range shaped, less ordered, few-layered, and close in contact with CdS, which are responsible for the enhanced H 2  evolution performance. We believe that the present work opens up a new avenue for the fabrication of MoS 2 /sulphide used for efficient photocatalytic H 2  evolution.",

The problem of inconsistency which is often encountered in the classical SPH method is alleviated by introducing modifications of the kernel function and its derivatives using an explicit polynomial feature representation based on the Taylor series expansion. Tensile instabilities arising in the Eulerian-based SPH formulation which appear due to large deformations are attenuated by the introduction of a total Lagrangian formulation which is robust for large displacements/rotations. The resulting nonlinear problem is solved using the explicit dynamics time integration scheme. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two numerical applications involving geometrical nonlinearities, where the obtained results are compared to those obtained using the standard finite element method.",

They determine the error locator polynomial and compute the error magnitudes, respectively. A recursive algorithm called reformulated inversionless Berlekamp Massey (riBM) algorithm is widely used for the KES block. However, for high rate RS codes, such as single-error-correcting (SEC) and double-error-correcting (DEC) RS codes, a method to find errata patterns directly has been proposed in the literature. We extend the method and derive the direct calculation algorithm for quadruple-error-correcting (QEC) RS codes in this work. An optimized architecture of the proposed algorithm is further developed. The computational complexity is reduced significantly by the proposed direct calculation method. Moreover, the data paths of the proposed architecture are all feed-forward and thus pipelining can be easily employed for high-speed applications.",

        "abstract": "Generalized integrated interleaved (GII) codes have attracted much attention in distributed storage systems since they can reduce the overall redundancy by creating redundancy shared by the interleaves. The Berlekamp-Massey (BM) algorithm makes the GII decoding efficient by reusing the preceding results at each decoding stage. However, it also forms the speed bottleneck of GII decoders. The reformulated inversionless Berlekamp-Massey (riBM) algorithm is well known for its short critical path, but it is not generally suitable for GII decoding since its polynomials are difficult to be reused directly. In this paper, we address this issue by reinitializing the polynomials and propose a riBM-based GII decoding algorithm. In our simulations, slight performance degradation induced by the first-layer miscorrection is observed in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. Hence, a subtle method is introduced to handle the miscorrected interleaves. Furthermore, the hardware architecture of the proposed decoding algorithm is developed and a high throughput decoder for the given example GII code is implemented. The synthesis results under TSMC 28-nm technology show that the decoder can achieve a throughput of up to 124 Gb/s. Moreover, the decoder has been implemented into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to validate its error-correction performance.",

        "abstract": "Turbo product codes (TPCs) are being considered as a competitive forward error correction scheme for ultra high speed network communication beyond 100Gbps [1], [2]. Conventional soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoders for turbo product codes (TPCs) need to exchange extrinsic soft messages between row and column component decoders. However, the extrinsic information increases the difficulty of hardware implementation. First of all, for a two dimensional message memory, row and column component decoders access soft messages in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, resulting in potential memory access conflict. Secondly, the computation complexity of calculating the soft extrinsic information is very high. Finally, storing the extrinsic information needs additional memory and updating it frequently increas the decoding latency and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a new soft-input hard-output (SIHO) decoding algorithm for TPCs. The proposed SIHO decoding algorithm requires the exchange of only hard information between row and column component decoders, leading to simpler decoder architectures. Moreover, each component decoder of a SIHO TPC decoder does not generate any soft information. In terms of error correction performance, the SIHO decoding algorithm is in between the SISO and the hard-input hard-output decoding algorithm. It is believed that the SIHO decoding algorithm is a good tradeoff between high net coding gain (NCG) and low complexity implementation.",

In this paper, a novel hard-decision decoding algorithm, called tabu-list random-penalty gradient descent bit-flipping (TRGDBF) algorithm, is proposed. Compared to the state-of-the-art hard-decision algorithms, the TRGDBF algorithm has much better error-correction performance due to several algorithmic improvements. First, a random-penalty term is introduced to the inversion function to help the decoder escape from trapping sets, which are the main causes of the error-floor phenomenon. Second, a tabu-list is employed to improve the decoding efficiency. Numerical results show that the TRGDBF algorithm can achieve up to two orders of magnitude better error-correction performance than the probabilistic gradient descent bit-flipping (PGDBF) algorithm and reduce the average iteration count by about 15%. In addition, a well-optimized hardware architecture is developed to implement the TRGDBF algorithm. Algorithmic transformation and architecture optimization are well explored to reduce the hardware complexity and latency. Synthesis results show that the TRGDBF decoder can work at a higher frequency and offer a larger throughput than the PGDBF decoder.",

        "abstract": "Thermal sensor noise has great impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of a dynamic thermal management (DTM) strategy. Conventional reactive thermal management techniques suffer significant performance degradation due to the pessimistic reaction. In this paper, to address the problem of forecasting temperatures based on noisy thermal readings, we propose a Kalman predictor based runtime thermal prediction scheme, which can predict temperatures N step ahead. An activity-based power model for 3D NoC power estimation is also proposed; the model is an essential prerequisite of accurate temperature predictions. Besides that, we propose a distributed multi-input single-output (MISO) thermal model for 3D NoC systems, which reduces the computational complexity of temperature updating from m2 to m compared with the centralized multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model for the system with m units. The experimental results show that the proposed prediction scheme reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) by 42.8%-72.6% compared with the auto-regressive (AR) based prediction scheme.",

Oral corticosteroids (2 mg/kg per day) was used as the first-line therapy on all of the patients and intravenous vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 every week) was added when the platelet counts didn't recover obviously after 2-3 weeks. After the recovery of the platelet counts, the patients were admitted for sclerotherapy (average, 4.56 sessions per case) with 100% alcohol (1-3 ml per session), Lauromacrogol (1.25-5 ml per session) and betamethasone (0.25-1 ml per session). All the patients were followed up for 42 months ( range, 9 months to 6.5 years). Therapeutic outcomes were assessed by evaluating platelet counts, size of lesion, function of trunk and limb.All the 25 cases got obvious recovery in the platelet counts [average, (94.3 \u00b1 18.5) x 10(9)/L] after drug therapy, of which 16 were treated by single oral corticosteroids for 4-7 weeks and 9 were treated by corticosteroids plus intravenous vincristine for 2-5 weeks. Meantime, 11 cases received platelet transfusions, of which 3 were coupled with gamma globulin intramuscularly. During the first admission, each of the 25 cases received 1-4 sessions of sclerotherapy (average, 2.6 sessions each case). One week after the sclerotherapy, the platelet counts returned to (167-312) x 10(9)/L (average, (258.5 \u00b1 34.4) x 10(9)/L). The hemoglobin and blood coagulation function returned to normal within 1-5 weeks. Meanwhile the mental condition, appetite, body weight, sleeping were greatly improved. The size of the lesions decreased gradually after the combined therapy including 13 cases within 3-12 months and 13 cases within 13-36 months. Long term follow-up indicated that only 1 case need treatment for recurrent decrease of platelet counts, and all of the 25 cases kept the normal weight, height, immunity as well as the growing development.Oral corticosteroids plus intravenous vincristine combined with sclerotherapy is a reliable management with high cure rate, short course and minor side-effect.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell senescence and exhaustion are considered important drivers of organismal aging, and human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have emerged as a promising cell source for cell-based therapy. However, aging and low survival rate compromise the optimal outcome of cell-based therapy due to oxidative stress in the graft areas. Oxidative stress has long been considered to be harmful to cells, nevertheless, in this study, we found that lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide (HO) decreased the number of SA-\u03b2gal-immunopositive cells, which was ameliorated by inhibition of SIRT1. Autophagy, a degradation mechanism that plays a major role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and, is involved in this effect. SIRT1 protein level in ADSCs was increased by the treatment with HO, meanwhile, HO activated p53-depended apoptosis in high concentration. Incubation of ADSCs with HO dose dependently induced ADSCs apoptosis. SIRT1 overexpression reduced the rate of ADSCs apoptosis, whereas SIRT1 downregulation and EX527 displayed the opposite effect. SIRT1 overexpression decreased the total p53 protein, whereas SIRT1 downregulation and EX527 increased the amount of p53 protein. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that SIRT1 could bind to p53, reduce its acetylation level, and treatment with nutlin-3A reversed the effect of SIRT1 on the level of p53 in ADSCs. These results suggest that SIRT1 had a pivotally protective role in the regulation of ADSCs aging and apoptosis induced by HO.",

Twenty-six parotid hemangiomas patients were subjected to combined treatment from January 2009 and June 2014. The effects of the therapy modality were evaluated. Nineteen patients were females and 7 were males. The median age of treatment initiation was 4.96 months. Twelve lesions were located on the left side parotid glands, while thirteen lesions affected the right side. One infant had bilateral lesions. One to six (average 2.04) injections were performed and the mean period for propranolol was 8.94 months. All the patients got satisfied aesthetic outcomes. No complications of propranolol or sclerotherapy occurred during the whole medication period. The study demonstrated that combination of propranolol and sclerotherapy was an effective and safe method for infantile parotid hemangiomas. Larger-scale studies should be performed to further investigate the long-term efficacy and results of the present combined method for infantile parotid hemangiomas. ",

In this study, the ultrasonic vibration assisted compression tests were carried out on pure titanium in order to improve its formability. The results indicating that the ultrasonic vibration had no effort on elastic deformation, and the temperature of material only increased by 6\u202f\u00b0C after compression with applying the ultrasonic vibration. Therefore the influence of temperature increase on reduction of flow stress could be ignored. After excluding interface friction and temperature effects, ultrasonic vibration can still decline the flow stress, the mechanism of deformation includes ultrasonic softening, stress superposition and strain hardening. In the intermittent vibration tests, the material shows the residual softening effect after stopping vibration. By observing the microstructure of material with SEM, it shows that the ultrasonic vibration can promote the generation of deformation twins, causing the grain refinement and the reduction of the twins, which is the major factor of affecting the residual softening effect.",

The influence rules of process parameters on the NC layers and surface hardness of peened pure titanium were analyzed with experimental results measured by Vickers microhardness meter, optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM).

        "abstract": "SummaryThis paper presents an alternative topology optimization method based on an efficient meshless smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm. To currently calculate the objective compliance, the deficiencies in standard SPH method are eliminated by introducing corrective smoothed particle method and total Lagrangian formulation. The compliance is established relative to a designed density variable at each SPH particle which is updated by optimality criteria method. Topology optimization is realized by minimizing the compliance using a modified solid isotropic material with penalization approach. Some numerical examples of plane elastic structure are carried out and the results demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed SPH method in the topology optimization problem.

In this paper, three-dimensional surface topography image, surface roughness and static contact angle of pure titanium treated by USP with different process parameters were obtained by non-contact optical surface profilometer and contact angle meter. Based on the experimental results, the influence rules and mechanism of process parameters, including peening duration, shot diameter, sonotrode amplitude and peening distance, on surface roughness and hydrophilicity of peened pure titanium were studied and the relation between surface roughness and hardness was also analyzed. After that, two relationship expressions were identified: one was between the surface roughness and surface hardness of pure titanium treated by USP while the other one was between the surface roughness and the process parameters with a correlation coefficient equal to 0.9804. According to the Wenzel model, the changes of the roughness factor r and the Young angle \u03b8 of pure titanium with different process parameters were calculated, then the influence of the surface roughness and the Young angle \u03b8 on the hydrophilicity of pure titanium were also discussed.",

Tensile tests of AZ31 magnesium alloy were carried out. The stress\u2013strain relationship, fracture modes of tensile specimens, microstructure and microhardness under different vibration conditions were analyzed, in order to study the effects of the ultrasonic vibration on microstructure and performance of AZ31 magnesium alloy under tensile deformation. The results showed that the different reductions of the true stress appeared under various ultrasonic vibration conditions, and the maximum decreasing range was 4.76%. The maximum microhardness difference among the 3 nodes selected along the specimen was HV 10.9. The fracture modes, plasticity and microstructure of AZ31 magnesium alloy also were affected by amplitude and action time of the ultrasonic vibration. The softening effect and the hardening effect occurred simultaneously when the ultrasonic vibration was applied. When the ultrasonic amplitude was 4.6 \u03bcm with short action time, the plastic deformation was dominated by twins and the softening effect was dominant. However, the twinning could be inhibited and the hardening effect became dominant in the case of high ultrasonic energy.",

This method is validated by comparison of the bending deformation with analytical method, ABAQUS and a self-programmed finite element code.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, a meshless method named Moving Least Squares Particle Hydrodynamics (MLSPH) method is applied to obtain numerical solutions of the Burgers\u2019 equation with a set of initial and boundary conditions. The influence of kernel function and smoothing length on the accuracy of MLSPH method is investigated. Several various forms of one- and two- dimensional Burgers\u2019 equations are successfully calculated. It is concluded that the proposed method can obtain second-order accuracy. The way of non-uniform distribution is applied to present the desired performance near the shocks. The numerical results obtained by the proposed method are compared with the analytical solutions and the results obtained by some other methods. The satisfactorily small errors indicate the high precision of the proposed method to solve this kind of partial differential equation.",

Tensile tests of AZ31 magnesium alloy were carried out. The stress\u2013strain relationship, fracture modes of tensile specimens, microstructure and microhardness under different vibration conditions were analyzed, in order to study the effects of the ultrasonic vibration on microstructure and performance of AZ31 magnesium alloy under tensile deformation. The results showed that the different reductions of the true stress appeared under various ultrasonic vibration conditions, and the maximum decreasing range was 4.76%. The maximum microhardness difference among the 3 nodes selected along the specimen was HV 10.9. The fracture modes, plasticity and microstructure of AZ31 magnesium alloy also were affected by amplitude and action time of the ultrasonic vibration. The softening effect and the hardening effect occurred simultaneously when the ultrasonic vibration was applied. When the ultrasonic amplitude was 4.6 \u03bcm with short action time, the plastic deformation was dominated by twins and the softening effect was dominant. However, the twinning could be inhibited and the hardening effect became dominant in the case of high ultrasonic energy.",

Methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS), styrene-maleic anhydride (SMA), ethylene methylacrylate (EMA), and silicon acrylate rubber (SiR) were used as toughness modifiers. Two kinds of aryl phosphorus, namely, triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (RDP), and oligomeric siloxane-containing potassium dodecyl diphenylsulfone sulfonate (SiKSS) were adopted as flame retardants (FRs). The V-notched Izod impact test revealed that SiR could significantly improve the toughness of GF-reinforced polycarbonate composites. The flame retardancy of FR PC/GF/SiR composites was investigated by the UL-94 vertical burning test. The FR PC/GF/SiR composites showed good flame retardancy with a V0 rating when 9\u2009wt% TPP, 6 wt% TPP/RDP, or 0.2\u2009wt% SiKSS was added. The effect of the FRs on the mechanical properties, rheological properties and heat deflection temperature of PC/GF/SiR composites was also investigated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Microstructure and low-cycle fatigue behavior of spray-formed Al\u2013Li alloy 2195 extruded plate were investigated in this work. The spray-formed alloy after hot extrusion experiment was treated with solid solution treatment and artificial aging. Microstructure analysis indicated the aged plate was dominated by elongated unrecrystallized grains, and had a rolling-type texture along extrusion direction with the highest intensity at Brass component. The existence of T 1  phase strengthened the alloy crucially, but \u03b4\u2032 phase was basically absent. Then, the fully-reversed strain-controlled low-cycle fatigue tests were conducted at total strain amplitudes ranging from 0.4% to 1.0% for samples along two orthogonal directions. The stress-strain hysteresis loops were acquired, and the cyclic stress response curves were derived. At low strain amplitudes (0.4\u20130.5%), the initial cyclic hardening was slight and followed by a cyclic stability, while at higher strain amplitudes (0.6\u20131.0%), the alloy merely presented a continuously increasing cycle hardening behavior. Moreover, the fatigue life model based on the total strain energy was built and found to be suitable to predict life. Finally, the fatigue fractography observation showed that the fatigue source is relatively concentrated and the fracture surface had typical fatigue striations at 0.5% strain amplitude, while multiple cracks originated on the sample surface and the final fracture zone showed a ductile characteristic at 1.0%. The deformed microstructure near fracture surfaces were observed, and it was found that the cyclic hardening and stability were closely associated with the interaction between moving dislocations and obstacles including (sub)grain boundaries and secondary phase particles against them.",

The constitutive relationship, DRX kinetics and DRXed grain size were modelled, and numerical simulation was performed to verify their predicting accuracy. Moreover, the effects of deformation parameters on martensite structure after hot compression and quenching were analyzed. The results show that the strain compensated Arrhenius can accurately predict the flow stress with the average absolute relative error of 3.89% and correlation coefficient of 0.992. The fraction and grain size of DRX are strongly related to deformation conditions, and low strain rate and high temperature are beneficial for the occurrence of DRX. Moreover, the equation of DRX fraction was developed based on Avrami model, and the relationship between DRXed grain size and Zener-Holloman parameter was also established. The simulated results of true strain, DRX fraction and grain size agree well with experimental findings. Finally, it was found that the size of martensite packet became larger under high strain rate, while the aspect ratio of martensite lath increases at higher deformation temperature.",

Compared with the conventional cauliflower-like PPy (cPPy) that is synthesized without gravity assistance, GA-hPPy exhibits horn-like morphology in good ordering and uniform size, which leads to remarkably high ionic and electronic conductivity, as confirmed by apparent diffusion coefficient and limit diffusion coefficient. It presents great specific capacitance up to 360\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at the scanning rate of 10\u00a0mV\u00a0s \u22121  and ultrafast charging/discharging capability, with a specific capacitance of 208\u00a0F\u00a0g \u22121  at the scanning rate of 1000\u00a0mV\u00a0s \u22121 . Its cycling performance is validated to be stable as 88.2% of capacitance held after 10,000 continual cycles. With these distinguishing properties, GA-hPPy is promising to be an excellent active material for supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   By a novel two-step activation of the polypyrrole nanotube (PPyNT) precursor, nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbonaceous nanotubes (HPCNT) are successfully prepared. The as-prepared HPCNT not only exhibits an ultrahigh specific surface area of 2180\u202fm 2 \u202fg \u22121  and a large total pore volume of 1.22\u202fcm 3 \u202fg \u22121 , but also possesses a rich N-doping content of 8.2\u202fwt% which especially includes a high pyridinic-N content of 30%. As an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the HPCNT delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1372\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  and keeps a high retention of 89.3% over 100 cycles at 0.1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 . Even at a large current rate of 1\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 , the reversible capacity is still as high as 630\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  after 700 cycles. Compared with either the commercial graphite or the state-of-the-art LIB carbons in the literature, the HPCNT is quite competitive, which makes it a promising anode material for next-generation LIBs. Also, the outstanding performances of the HPCNT exhibit a great potential of this novel activation strategy for commercial application on LIBs.",

However, more than 300% volume variation of SnO2 during the charge/discharge process results in dramatic degradation of electrochemical performance and thus poor cyclic stability, which has hindered its application in LIBs. Here, a new strategy is proposed to suppress this volume change via anchoring mesoporous SnO2 on robust polypyrrole nanotubes (PPy NTs) to fabricate nanoarchitectured SnO2 composite. Benefiting from this nanoarchitecture design, the anode presents outstanding rate performance with a reversible specific capacity of about 770 mA h g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1) and remarkable cyclability accompanied by a high specific capacity of about 790 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles.

        "abstract": "In this work, polypyrrole/graphene doped by p-toluenesulfonic is prepared as an active material for supercapacitors, and its capacitance performance is investigated in various aqueous electrolytes including HCl, LiCl, NaCl, and KCl with a concentration of 3 M, respectively. A rising trend of capacitance is observed according to the cationic mobility (Li(+) < Na(+) < K(+) < H(+)), which is due to its effect on the ionic conductivity, efficient ion/charge diffusion/exchange and relaxation time. On the other hand, long-term cycling stability is in the following order: KCl < NaCl < LiCl < HCl, corresponding to the decreasing tendency of cation size (K(+) > Na(+) > Li(+) > H(+)). The reason can be attributed to the fact that the insertion/de-insertion of large size cation brings a significant doping level decrease and an over-oxidation increase during the charging-discharging cycles. Hence, we not only obtain good capacitance performance (280.3 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1)), superior rate capability (225.8 F g(-1) at 500 mV s(-1)) and high cycling stability (92.0% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g(-1)) by employing 3 M HCl as an electrolyte, but also reveal that the electrolyte cations have a significant effect on the supercapacitors' electrochemical performance.",

However, the bulky capacitor employed in each submodule (SM) accounts for more than half of the total volume and weight of the entire system. This prohibits further system level integration due to space and weight restrictions. To tackle this issue, a virtual infinite capacitor (VIC)-based active SM (VIC-SM) configuration is presented in this paper. Special attention is given to the charge control of an MMC with a low number of SMs. The concept is verified in the MATLAB/Simulink environment with a downscaled case study of a 50W 400VDC/110VAC 11 levels single phase MMC. We show that the VIC-SM can reduce the SM capacitance by 60% with sufficient safety margin.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a new control algorithm for the virtual infinite capacitor (VIC), which is based on a voltage control loop designed for the average model of the converter working in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The voltage controller generates a current reference which is used to generate the gate pulses for the switches via nonlinear open-loop control. The DCM operation combined with some simple improvements to the circuit allow the converter to be operated with soft switching (zero current or zero voltage switching). As a result, we obtain a VIC that operates at much lower switching frequency than was possible before, with very high precision of the voltage regulation, low ripple voltage and low power losses. We demonstrate the usefulness of this VIC as the filter capacitor of the two-phase interleaved power factor compensator (PFC). Our application example is a 230V AC grid connected PFC with an output voltage of 390V DC, feeding a 475W load. We achieve outstanding voltage smoothing performance with a constant switching frequency of 50kHz, significantly lower than what was used in [1], [2].",

The IHC results demonstrated that CapG was relatively highly expressed in CRC tissue compared with non-tumor tissue (P<0.001), and that the expression of CapG was significantly associated with the tumor site, differentiation, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage (P=0.021, P=0.036, P=0.012 and P=0.009, respectively). Wound healing and Transwell migration assays demonstrated that the reduction of CapG expression in a CRC cell line by RNA interference was associated with significantly impaired motility (P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the expression of CapG in tumor samples was not significantly associated with disease-free survival time. In conclusion, CapG was overexpressed in CRC and was associated with tumor progression; therefore, it may be a useful prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC.",

We aim to evaluate treatment outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), m-EMR and c-EMR for rectal NETs u003c16\u2009mm.Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Library and Elsevier Science Direct were searched to identify eligible articles. After quality assessment and data extraction, meta-analysis was performed. The main outcomes were complete resection rate, overall complication rate, procedure time and local recurrence rate.Results: Compared with c-EMR, ESD could achieve higher complete resection rate (OR\u2009=\u20094.38, 95%CI: 2.43\u20137.91, p\u2009u003c\u20090.00001) without increasing overall complication rates (OR\u2009=\u20092.21, 95%CI: 0.56\u20138.70, p\u2009=\u20090.25).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recently, a stag beetle (SB) knife was introduced to reduce the difficulty of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SB knife. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 71 patients undergoing POEM with the SB knife for esophageal achalasia were included. We used esophagography, manometry, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and Eckardt score to assess the utility and safety. RESULTS All cases were completed for POEM. The incidence of adverse events during the operation were 2.8%; however, all cases were treated conservatively. There was a vast improvement in clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings. The average Eckardt score was 6.9 before and 0.6 at 1 year after POEM (p<0.05). The average lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure before and 6 months after POEM were 44.34\u00b114.83 mmHg and 19.14\u00b16.74 mmHg (p<0.05), respectively. The average LES relaxation pressure before and 6 months after POEM was 12.11\u00b15.02 mmHg and 3.22\u00b12.29 mmHg (p<0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS POEM with the SB Knife is technically efficient and safe in treating achalasia and is associated with favorable short-term outcomes.",

Large amounts of customer data present rich business opportunities. Drawing on the privacy calculus model, this study investigates the antecedents of self-disclosure intention and self-disclosure honesty. We extend the privacy calculus model by exploring how the characteristics of service providers and the interpersonal difference of users influence privacy trade-off. An online empirical survey that involves 913 respondents was conducted. We find that both monetary rewards and social rewards positively predict self-disclosure intention, whereas only social rewards positively predict self-disclosure honesty. Moreover, application reputation and flow experience of users weaken the perceptions of privacy concern, and application compatibility and flow experience strengthen the perceptions of social rewards. Our results suggest that users place more weight on social rewards than on monetary rewards. Therefore, service providers are advised to create salient and distinct social rewards. They can also adopt distinct marketing strategies based on their profiles and the interpersonal difference of their users.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the combined effects of different modalities of long-term knowledge accumulation and short-term knowledge searching on the generation of high-impact ideas. The authors aim at providing useful conclusions for academic scholars.Design/methodology/approachTwo dimensions of the cumulative knowledge structures of researchers are measured: knowledge depth and knowledge breadth. The search strategies employed by researchers are classified as local search and distant search. The authors use researchers\u2019 historical publications to measure cumulative knowledge structures. References contained in these publications serve as an indicator of knowledge searching behaviors and are used to measure search strategies. Highly cited papers with random-but-matched papers from the same journal published in the same year are adopted to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe knowledge depth of researchers positively predicts the generation of high-impact ideas. Knowledge breadth has a bell-shaped relationship to the generation of high-impact ideas. Two instances of \u201cstrategic fit\u201d between the knowledge structures and search strategies of researchers are identified; namely, knowledge breadth combines most effectively with local search, and knowledge depth combines most effectively with distant search in generating high-impact ideas.Research limitations/implicationsUsing article references to measure authors\u2019 knowledge search behaviors may lead to biases. Future research should perform a survey to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the knowledge search behaviors of scholars.Practical implicationsA \u201cT-shaped\u201d knowledge structure in the long run is recommended for maximal generation of high-impact ideas. Researchers who have not adopted this optimal knowledge structure can employ a matched search strategy to leverage their existing knowledge structures.Originality/valueThis paper is among the first to examine the interactive effects between the cumulative knowledge structures and short-term knowledge searching strategies of researchers. The authors have enriched the exploration and exploitation theory by adding the dimension of time into the analysis.",

In this work, a new supersonic target jet mill based on aerodynamic theory is presented according to the flow field of a traditional jet mill. An annular supersonic flow produced by an annular converging-diverging nozzle is used to entrain the central particle flow by the shear mechanism in this new supersonic target jet mill. Then, the particle beam concentrating in the flow center impacts the target with high kinetic energy after the entrainment of the supersonic flow. An apparatus of the annular supersonic target jet mill was created to validate the theoretical design. Two types of experiments were implemented to estimate its performance. The validation experiments confirmed that the gas speed in the collision chamber was approximately 600 m/s and the supersonic flow could deliver a kinetic energy of approximately 180 J/s to the particles. The particle size reduction of boroncarbide (BC) and silica (Si) in the collision tests showed that the accelerated particles concentrated in the supersonic flow center collided on the targets precisely with high collision energy.",

The key instrument parameters for production of supersonic particle flow, such as annular nozzle, expansion angle and length of the accelerating duct, are theoretically designed and optimized. Based on the theoretical results, supersonic gas flow equipment is fabricated. The capacity of the present equipment for production of supersonic particle flow is demonstrated by particle image velocimetry measurement, and the maximum transient velocity of the particles achieves as much as 550 m s. Additionally, the present equipment is applied for continuous and physical preparation of ultrafine Si powders with a high scalability and mechanochemical synthesis of TiO and TiN nanopowders at a high production rate.",

        "abstract": "The air-flow impacting based mechanochemical synthesis is an alternative strategy to traditional mechanochemical preparations, which has many advantages in terms of reaction temperature, preparation speed, and cleanness. Herein, we theoretically study the effect of instrument parameters, including the axial position of physical target, the diameter difference between nozzle throat and suction pipe, and divergence angles of uniform speed region, on the flow field of the air-flow impacting based mechanochemical synthesis. The optimized parameters have been obtained. Under the optimal conditions, a stable and high-speed air flow is obtained, in which the speed can achieve a Mach number of approximately 2.6. The high-speed air flow is able to easily carry the reacting substances to arrive at the physical target, triggering a chemical reaction. These findings undoubtedly provide a key guideline for further development and application of the air-flow impacting based mechanochemical synthesis.",

An efficient robust aerodynamic optimization method on the basis of non-deterministic computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation and Efficient Global Optimization (EGO)algorithm was employed. A non-intrusive polynomial chaos method is used in conjunction with an existing well-verified CFD module to quantify the uncertainty propagation in the flow field. This paper investigates the roughness modeling behavior with the \u03b3-Ret shear stress transport model including modeling flow transition and surface roughness effects. The roughness effects are modeled to simulate sand grain roughness. A Class-Shape Transformation-based parametrical description of the nacelle contour as part of an automatic design evaluation process is presented. A Design-of-Experiments (DoE) was performed and surrogate model by Kriging method was built. The new design nacelle process demonstrates that ...",

Its pathogen, bluetongue virus (BTV) has a double-stranded RNA genome consisting of 10 segments that provides an opportunity for field and vaccine strains of different serotypes to reassort whilst simultaneously infecting the same animal. For the first time, we report the full-length genome sequence of a BTV strain of serotype 21 (5149E) isolated from sentinel cattle in Guangxi Province in China in 2015. Sequence analysis suggested that the isolate 5149E had undergone a reassortment incident and acquired seg-6 from an isolate of BTV-16 which originated from Japan.

        "abstract": "In 2013, seven virus strains were isolated from Culex tritaeniorhynchus and C. quinquefasciatus collected in Guangxi Province, China. The viruses caused cytopathological effects (CPE) only in C6/36 cells, and not in mammalian\u00a0cells, e.g. BHK21 and Vero cells. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the genomes of the seven virus strains ranged from 9589 to 9595 nt with G+C contents of 37.51-37.59%, and nucleotide sequence similarity >\u200999.8%. The nucleotide sequence homology of the seven virus strains with a Tanay virus isolate was 79.8-80.0%, while the corresponding amino acid homology of ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3 was 79.8-80, 73.9-4.6, and 93.4-94.3%, respectively. In phylogenetic analysis, based on the RdRP amino acid sequence, the seven virus strains were located on the same evolutionary branch, yet distinct from Tanay virus isolated from the Philippines. These results indicated that the seven virus strains isolated from Guangxi represent a new Tanay virus, \"Tanay-like virus\", within the genus Sandewavirus of the newly proposed taxon Negevirus. This was the first isolation of Tanay virus in China.",

Hearing impairment and anal atresia are rarely described. Here we described a 9-month-old female patient with hypotonia in all four limbs, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. In addition, congenital anal atresia was diagnosed and treated after birth, and hearing impairment was found in right ear. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array detected a 5.2\u202fMb deletion on 2q24.2q24.3, including 19 genes (ITGB6; TBR1; SLC4A10; KCNH7 SCN3A; SCN2A et al.). Among these genes, it is affirmative that TBR1 is a causative gene for intellectual disability; however, the pathogenic genes of other phenotypes remain unclear. We briefly review the knowledge of genes likely involved in these clinical features, including hearing impairment, anal atresia, and developmental delay.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of analyzing the dissolved gas in transformer oil is to determine the transformer\u2019s operating status and is an important basis for fault diagnosis. Accurate prediction of the concentration of dissolved gas in oil can provide an important reference for the evaluation of the state of the transformer. A combined predicting model is proposed based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) using an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (FFOA) to select the smooth factor. Firstly, based on the idea of using the dissolved gas ratio of oil to diagnose the transformer fault, gas concentration ratios are also used as characteristic parameters. Secondly, the main parameters are selected from the feature parameters using the KPCA method, and the GRNN is then used to predict the gas concentration in the transformer oil. In the training process of the network, the FFOA is used to select the smooth factor of the neural network. Through a concrete example, it is shown that the method proposed in this paper has better data fitting ability and more accurate prediction ability compared with the support vector machine (SVM) and gray model (GM) methods.",

        "abstract": "The accurate prediction and evaluation of the operating status of transmission line can provide technical support for the safe, economical and efficient operation of the power system. Most of the traditional methods just use a single parameter for the forecasting and analysis of transmission line. The running state of transmission line is also affected by weather conditions, operating conditions and many other factors. Due to the low quality of the monitoring data and the large randomness of the environmental conditions, the traditional methods have great limitations in the accuracy and timeliness of the prediction. In this paper, a load prediction method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) is proposed. Firstly, the principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of the original data, and the parameters with less influencing factors are eliminated. Main parameters are extracted to train the online sequential extreme learning machine. The practical examples show that the proposed method has better data fitting ability and higher prediction accuracy.",

Miniaturizing optical trap instruments onto optofluidic platforms holds promise for high-throughput lab-on-a-chip applications. However, a persistent challenge with existing optofluidic devices has been achieving controlled and precise manipulation of trapped particles. Here, we report a new class of on-chip optical trapping devices. Using photonic interference functionalities, an array of stable, three-dimensional on-chip optical traps is formed at the antinodes of a standing-wave evanescent field on a nanophotonic waveguide. By employing the thermo-optic effect via integrated electric microheaters, the traps can be repositioned at high speed (\u223c30 kHz) with nanometre precision. We demonstrate sorting and manipulation of individual DNA molecules. In conjunction with laminar flows and fluorescence, we also show precise control of the chemical environment of a sample with simultaneous monitoring. Such a controllable trapping device has the potential to achieve high-throughput precision measurements on chip.",

        "abstract": "Wuyi Rock tea, well-recognized for rich flavor and long-lasting fragrance, is a premium subcategory of oolong tea mainly produced in Wuyi Mountain and nearby regions of China. The quality of tea is mainly determined by the chemical constituents in the tea leaves. However, this remains underexplored for Wuyi Rock tea cultivars. In this study, we investigated the leaf metabolite profiles of 14 major Wuyi Rock tea cultivars grown in the same producing region using UPLC-QTOF MS and UPLC-QqQ MS with data processing via principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Relative quantitation of 49 major metabolites including flavan-3-ols, proanthocyanidins, flavonol glycosides, flavone glycosides, flavonone glycosides, phenolic acid derivatives, hydrolysable tannins, alkaloids and amino acids revealed clear variations between tea cultivars. In particular, catechins, kaempferol and quercetin derivatives were key metabolites responsible for cultivar discrimination. Information on the varietal differences in the levels of bioactive/functional metabolites, such as methylated catechins, flavonol glycosides and theanine, offers valuable insights to further explore the nutritional values and sensory qualities of Wuyi Rock tea. It also provides potential markers for tea plant fingerprinting and cultivar identification.",

However, little is known about how developmental cues affect the synthesis of many of these molecules. In this study, we conducted a comparative profiling of specialized metabolites from six different tissues in a premium oolong tea cultivar, , which is gaining worldwide popularity due to its uniquely rich flavors and health benefits. UPLC-QTOF MS combined with multivariate analyses tentatively identified 68 metabolites belonging to 11 metabolite classes, which exhibited sharp variations among tissues. Several metabolite classes, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and hydroxycinnamic acid amides were detected predominantly in certain plant tissues. In particular, tricoumaroyl spermidine and dicoumaroyl putrescine were discovered as unique tea flower metabolites. This study offers novel insights into tissue-specific specialized metabolism in , which provides a good reference point to explore gene-metabolite relationships in this cultivar.",

        "abstract": "White tea (WT) is one of six tea types originally derived from Fujian Province, China. White tea is known for its health-promoting properties. However, the neuroprotective and anti-aggregatory properties of WT against the hallmark toxic Alzheimer's protein, A\u03b2 have not been investigated. In this study, WT, green tea (GT), oolong tea (OT) and black tea (BT) were manufactured using tea leaves from the cultivar  (Jin Guanyin). The protective effects of these tea extracts were then studied under oxidative stress conditions via -bhp and HO exposure, in addition to A\u03b2 treatment using a PC-12 cell model. Each tea type failed to rescue PC-12 cells from either -bhp or HO-mediated toxicity, however each extract exerted significant protection against A\u03b2-evoked neurotoxicity. Results of the Thioflavin T Kinetic (ThT) and TEM assay showed that A\u03b2 aggregate formation was inhibited by each tea type. Additionally, TEM also supported the different anti-aggregatory effect of WT by modifying A\u03b2 into an amorphous and punctate aggregate morphology. Higher accumulated precedent or potential neuroprotective compounds in WT, including ECG''3Me, 8--ascorbyl-EGCG, GABA and Gln, in addition to flavonol or flavone glycosides detected by using UPLC-QTOF-MS and UPLC-QqQ-MS, may contribute to a favourable anti-aggregative and neuroprotective effect of WT against A\u03b2.",

        "abstract": "Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from stem cells has been shown as a promising biomaterial for bone regeneration because of the promotion effect on osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, bone regeneration is also influenced by bone resorption and little is known about the effect of cell-derived ECM on osteoclast differentiation. In this study, ECM was deposited by MSCs and, after decellularization, the effect of ECM on osteoclastogenesis of bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) was investigated in comparison to standard tissue culture polystyrene. Our results showed that cell-derived ECM improved BMM proliferation but potently inhibited osteoclast differentiation, evidenced by down-regulation of multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells, areas of actin rings, and osteoclast-specific gene expression. ECM-mediated attenuation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was suggested to play a rival role in the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, because exogenous hydrogen peroxide supplementation partially rescued the ECM-inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, rather than collagen type I, fibronectin in the ECM contributed to ECM-mediated anti-osteoclastogenesis. In conclusion, stem cell-derived decellularized ECM significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis via the attenuation of intracellular ROS. The anti-osteoclastogenic property of cell-derived ECM may benefit its clinical use for modulating bone remodeling and promoting bone tissue engineering.

        "abstract": "Osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) is a central event in bone formation. However, oxidative stress has a deleterious impact on BM-MSC osteogenesis. In this study, we hypothesized that oxidative stress influenced BM-MSC osteogenesis differently in the early or late stages, in which silent information regulator type 1 (SIRT1) played a critical role. A continuous exposure to sublethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H O ), ranging from 25\u2009\u00b5M to 100\u2009\u00b5M for 21 days, resulted in the complete inhibition of BM-MSC osteogenesis. We found that a 7-day treatment with H O inhibited the lineage commitment of BM-MSCs toward osteoblasts, as evidenced by a significant reduction of alkaline phosphatase activity (a typical marker for early osteogenesis). However, moderate oxidative stress did not affect late-differentiated BM-MSCs, as there were comparable levels of matrix mineralization (a typical marker for late osteogenesis). In addition, we observed a spontaneous up-regulation of SIRT1 and intracellular antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 2, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase 1, which accounted for the enhanced resistance to oxidative stress upon osteogenic differentiation. Activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol rescued the effect of H O on early-differentiated BM-MSCs and inhibition of SIRT1 by nicotinamide intensified the effect of H O on late-differentiated BM-MSCs, indicating that the SIRT1-mediated pathway was actively involved in MSC osteogenesis and antioxidant mechanisms. Our findings uncovered the relationship between SIRT1 and resistance to H O -induced oxidative stress during BM-MSC osteogenesis, which could provide a new strategy for protecting MSCs from extracellular oxidative stress.

        "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative joint disease involving both articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Kartogenin (KGN) was recently identified to improve  cartilage repair; however, its effect on bone formation is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of KGN on antioxidant properties and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Human BM-MSCs were treated with KGN at concentrations ranging from 10\u2009M to 10\u2009M. Our results indicated that KGN improved cell proliferation and attenuated intracellular reactive oxygen species. The levels of antioxidant enzymes and osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs were enhanced by KGN in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, KGN-treated BM-MSCs showed upregulation of silent information regulator type 1 (SIRT1) and increased phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating that KGN activated the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway in BM-MSCs. Inhibition of SIRT1 by nicotinamide reversed the antioxidant effect of KGN on BM-MSCs and suppressed osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that KGN improved intracellular antioxidant properties and promoted osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs by activating the AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway. Thus, KGN may have the potential for not only articular cartilage repair but also the clinical application of MSCs in bone tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system.",

        "title": "Fluvastatin decreases cardiac fibrosis possibly through regulation of TGF-\u03b21/Smad 7 expression in the spontaneously hypertensive rats",
        "abstract": "Statins ameliorate myocardial fibrosis after myocardial infarction. We designed this study to determine whether fluvastatin reduced hypertension-induced myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis and whether these fluvastatin effects involved transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and Smad 7, factors known to play a role in the myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. We randomized 14 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to receiving vehicle or 5\u201320\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin for 8\u00a0weeks. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats receiving vehicle or 10\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin were also studied. SHRs had an increased blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis compared with WKY rats. SHRs also had an elevated TGF-\u03b21 expression and a decreased Smad 7 expression. These changes in SHRs were dose-dependently attenuated by fluvastatin. For example, the hydroxyproline content was 3.2 \u00b1 0.1, 4.0 \u00b1 0.1 and 3.5 \u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u00b5g/mg heart and the Smad 7 protein expression was 5.1 \u00b1 0.6, 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 and 4.1 \u00b1 0.7 arbitrary units for WKY rats, SHRs and SHRs receiving 20\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin, respectively. The hydroxyproline content in the SHRs treated with or without fluvastatin was positively correlated with the left ventricular mass index, systolic blood pressure and the amount of TGF-\u03b21 proteins and negatively correlated with the Smad 7 expression level. The left ventricular mass index was positively correlated with the systolic blood pressure. Fluvastatin did not alter the blood pressure, left ventricular mass index and collagen content of WKY rats. These results suggest that fluvastatin reduces hypertension-induced myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. These effects may involve an increased expression of Smad 7 and a decreased expression of TFG-\u03b21. Our results call for clinical studies to evaluate these fluvastatin effects in hypertensive patients. Keywords Fibrosis Hypertension Hypertrophy Statin 1 Introduction Ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptive response to increased haemodynamic load and is identified as an independent risk factor of mortality for hypertensive patients ( Simko, 2002 ). Ventricular hypertrophy is manifested clinically as increase in the size and alteration in the shape and function of the heart ( Cohn et al., 2000 ). Histopathologically, it is characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibroblast proliferation and cell death ( Swynghedauw, 1999 ). These pathological processes can lead to cardiac fibrosis that is a result of disproportionate accumulation of extracellular matrix components, such as type I and type III collagen, in the heart. Cardiac fibrosis impedes both contraction and relaxation function and is arrhythmogenic ( Covell, 1990; Swynghedauw, 1999; Wu et al., 2004 ), indicating the role of anti-fibrosis therapy in improving cardiac functions. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or so-called statins, reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with high and moderate hypercholesterolemia or even normal cholesterol levels ( Sever et al., 2003 ). Recently, statins have been found to exert biological effects other than their cholesterol-lowering actions. These pleiotropic effects of statins include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques ( Davignon, 2004 ). Statins have also been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. For example, simvastatin reduces human myofibroblast proliferation ( Porter et al., 2004 ). Atorvastatin attenuates the angiotensin II-induced collagen synthesis by rat or human cardiac fibroblasts ( Martin et al., 2005 ). Simvastatin also induces regression of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and improves cardiac function in a transgenic rabbit model of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( Patel et al., 2001 ). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is a powerful initiator for the synthesis of collagens and other major extracellular matrix components in many organ systems ( Khan and Sheppard, 2006 ). Evidence supports that TGF-\u03b21, produced mainly by cardiac fibroblast and myofibroblast in the heart ( Eghbali, 1989 ), contributes to the development of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy ( Rosenkranz, 2004 ). It has been shown that the expression of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA is increased in the left ventricular myocardium of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy and in animals after myocardial infarction ( Li et al., 1998; Pauschinger et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2002 ). Down-regulation of the TGF-\u03b21 expression suppressed myocardial fibrosis ( Kawano et al., 2000 ). The TGF-\u03b21 signaling can be transmitted through the Smad protein family ( Kretzschmar and Massague, 1998 ). Three groups of Smads have been identified ( Massague, 1990 ). The receptor-regulated Smads and common mediator Smad transduce the TGF-\u03b21 signaling to cell nucleus. The inhibitory Smads can bind with the activated TGF-\u03b21 receptors and prevent the signaling transduction through the receptor-regulated Smads and common mediator Smad ( Derynck and Zhang, 2003 ). Smad 7 is one of the inhibitory Smads and is expressed in the myocardium ( Wang et al., 2002 ). Defects in Smad 7 may lead to fibrotic conditions. Over-expression of Smad 7 in primary adult fibroblasts is associated with decreased type I and III collagen expression ( Wang et al., 2002 ). We designed this study to test the hypotheses that statins reduce hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis and that these effects are mediated by regulating the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7. In this study, we administrated fluvastatin to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). We chose fluvastatin because it is a commonly used statin and has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ( Ballantyne et al., 1999; Ribaut-Barassin et al., 2000 ). 2 Materials and methods The investigation conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University. 2.1 Animals and fluvastatin treatment Twelve-week-old male SHRs and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were purchased from Vital Riva (Beijing, China). Standard chow and water were provided ad libitum and the animals were maintained on a 12\u00a0h light/dark cycle. After a 2-week accommodation to the new environment, SHRs were randomly divided to receive 5, 10 or 20\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin or the vehicle (distilled water) for 8\u00a0weeks. Rats were 22-week-old at the end of experiments. Fluvastatin (Novartis Pharmaceutical Company, China) was dissolved in distilled water. The drug or distilled water was administered orally by gavage once a day. The age-matched male WKY rats received distilled water or 10\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin in the same way for 8\u00a0weeks. The systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff method before and after the treatment. At the end of the study, the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate 3\u00a0ml/kg. Venous blood samples and hearts were harvested. The body weight and left ventricular mass were measured. The left ventricular mass index that is the ratio of left ventricular mass to body weight was calculated. The left ventricle, including the septum of the heart, was transversed into three parts: apex, middle ring and base that were put into a mixture of acetone and aether, 10% neutral formalin and liquid nitrogen, respectively, for further analysis. Venous blood samples from inferior vena cava were used for measurement of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) by our central laboratories. 2.2 Hydroxyproline content assay Hydroxyproline was assayed using a procedure described previously ( Switzer, 1991 ). The apex of left ventricle was defatted and lysed. The sample was centrifuged at 4000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was mixed with fresh chloramine T for 10\u00a0min and then with Ehrlich's reagent at 75\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. After samples were cooled, optical density was read at 560\u00a0nm with a spectrophotometer that was adjusted by a blank. The blank was prepared by the same procedure but without cardiac tissues in the reaction mixture. Hydroxyproline concentration, expressed as micrograms per milligram of dry heart weight, was then calculated as described before ( Switzer, 1991 ). 2.3 Immunohistochemical analysis of collagen composition After fixed in 10% neutral formalin for 24\u00a0h, the middle ring of left ventricle was embedded in paraffin and cut into 4\u00a0\u03bcm thick sections. The section was incubated with primary antibodies [rabbit polyclonal anti-type I collagen antibody or anti-type III collagen antibody from Boster Biotect CO. (Wuhan, China) at a 1:150 dilution] at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. Incubation with the secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody also from Boster Biotect CO.) was performed at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Staining was generated with the streptavidin biotin\u2013peroxidase complex immunohistochemical staining kit from Boster Biotect CO. Negative controls were performed by leaving out the primary antibody. Sections were viewed with 400\u00d7 magnification and the intensity of the collagen staining was analyzed using the IBAS2.5 Image Analytical System (Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Beijing, China) as described before ( Sheng, 1995 ). Five random fields per section were analyzed to produce a single number for the section. 2.4 Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis Semiquantification of the mRNA expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 was performed by RT-PCR method. Total RNA was extracted from the base of left ventricle. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to the RT-PCR analyses using the RT-PCR High-Plus kit (Toyobo CO., Osaka, Japan). The forward primer and the reverse primer for rat TGF-\u03b21, Smad 7 and \u03b2-actin were as follows: TGF-\u03b21 forward, 5\u2032-GAA GCC ATC CGT GGC CAG AT -3\u2032; TGF-\u03b21 reverse, 5\u2032-CCA GTG ACG TCA AAA GAC AG-3\u2032; Smad 7 forward, 5\u2032-CCAACTGCAGACTGTCCAGA-3'; Smad 7 reverse, 5\u2032-CAGGCTCCAGAAGAAGTTGG-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin forward, 5\u2032-CCT TCC TGG GTA TGG AAT CCT-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin reverse, 5\u2032-GGA GCA ATG ATC TTG ATC TT-3\u2032. The bands were quantified densitometrically by a SynGene GeneGenius Bio Imaging System (Synoptics, Cambridge, UK). The results of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 were normalized by that of \u03b2-actin in the same sample. The data of WKY or SHRs in the fluvastatin treatment groups were then normalized by the mean value of SHRs in the vehicle control group. 2.5 Western blotting The base of left ventricle was used for Western analysis. Fifty micrograms of proteins were loaded for each lane. The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-TGF-\u03b21 or anti-Smad 7 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at a 1:200 dilution and rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b2-actin from Boster Biotect CO. at a 1:400 dilution. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) at a 1:4000 dilution. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence detection and analyzed by the SynGene GeneGenius Bio Imaging System. The data of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 were normalized by the results of \u03b2-actin. The data of WKY or SHRs in the fluvastatin treatment groups were then normalized by the mean value of SHRs in the vehicle control group. 2.6 Statistical analysis Results are presented as means \u00b1 S.D. Each group has more than 6 animals. Differences in the data obtained before and after treatment in each group were compared by paired t tests. Differences in the data among the groups were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test. Correlation was assessed using a Pearson's correlation coefficient. P < 0.05 was considered significant. 3 Results 3.1 Effects of fluvastatin on serum lipid levels and systolic blood pressure We randomized 7 rats into each group. All rats except for one in the SHR vehicle control group survived at the end of the 8-week study. The data of the dead SHR were not included in the results presented in this paper. Table 1 summarizes the results of serum cholesterol and lipid levels at the end of the study. The serum cholesterol and lipid levels of WKY rats were not different from those of SHR control rats. Fluvastatin at 20\u00a0mg/kg/day significantly reduced the serum cholesterol of SHRs ( Table 1 ). The other lipid profiles were not affected by fluvastatin at the doses tested. Systolic blood pressure of SHRs was significantly higher than that of WKY rats. Fluvastatin at 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg/day significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure of SHRs ( Table 2 ). The heart rates of SHRs were not different from those of WKY rats. Fluvastatin at any doses tested did not affect the heart rates ( Table 2 ). Fluvastatin at 10\u00a0m/kg/day did not alter the systolic blood pressure of WKY rats ( Table 2 ). 3.2 Fluvastatin attenuated cardiac hypertrophy of SHRs The body weights of SHRs were lower than those of age-matched WKY rats. Untreated SHRs showed left ventricular hypertrophy as reflected by the increased left ventricle mass and left ventricular mass index compared with WKY rats. Fluvastatin dose-dependently reduced the left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index of the SHRs ( Table 3 ), suggesting that fluvastatin attenuated the progression of the left ventricular hypertrophy. Fluvastatin at 10\u00a0m/kg/day did not alter the left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index of WKY rats ( Table 3 ). 3.3 Fluvastatin reduced cardiac fibrosis of SHRs Since myocardial fibrosis contributes to the pathology of ventricular hypertrophy ( Assayag et al., 1997; Rossi, 1998 ), we determined whether fluvastatin attenuated ventricular interstitial collagen deposition. As depicted in Fig. 1 , marked deposition of collagen I and collagen III was detected in the cardiac interstitial tissues of the SHRs compared with the WKY rats. This increased collagen deposition in the SHRs was dose-dependently ameliorated by fluvastatin. Consistent with the collagen deposition data, hydroxyproline content was elevated in the left ventricle of SHRs compared with WKY rats and this elevation was dose-dependently attenuated by fluvastatin ( Fig. 2 ). Hydroxyproline is mainly in the collagen in the mammalian proteins. Hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to reflect collagen amount in mammalian tissues. Thus, our results suggest that fluvastatin dose-dependently reduces left ventricular fibrosis in the SHRs. In contrast, 10\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin did not change the collagen I, collagen III and hydroxyproline contents in the hearts of WKY rats ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). 3.4 Effects of fluvastatin on the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 The expression of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein was increased in the left ventricles of SHRs compared with WKY rats. This increase was dose-dependently reduced by fluvastatin ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). Interestingly, the expression of Smad 7 mRNA and protein in the left ventricles of SHRs was lower than that of WKY rats. Fluvastatin dose-dependently increased the mRNA and protein expression of Smad 7 in the left ventricles of the SHRs ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). Fluvastatin at 10\u00a0mg/kg/day did not change the expression of Smad 7 and TGF-\u03b21 in the left ventricles of the WKY rats ( Figs. 3 and 4 ). 3.5 Relationship among blood pressure, cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy and contribution of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 to cardiac fibrosis The pooled data from all SHRs treated with or without fluvastatin showed that the hydroxyproline content was significantly correlated with the left ventricular mass index ( Fig. 5 A ), suggesting that the reduced cardiac interstitial fibrosis by fluvastatin contributes to the decreased left ventricular mass index by this drug in SHRs. The hydroxyproline content was also significantly correlated with the systolic blood pressure in the SHRs ( Fig. 5 B), indicating that the reduced interstitial fibrosis by fluvastatin may involve the reduction of systolic blood pressure by this drug. The left ventricular mass index was correlated with the systolic blood pressure ( Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the reduction of blood pressure by fluvastatin contributes to its attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy. The reduced cardiac fibrosis by fluvastatin may be mediated by the increased expression of Smad 7 and decreased TGF-\u03b21 expression because the hydroxyproline content was negatively correlated with the Smad 7 protein expression and was positively correlated with the TGF-\u03b21 protein expression ( Fig. 5 D and E). 4 Discussion Hypertension is a common disease and can cause cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, the major determinants of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases ( Assayag et al., 1997; Haider et al., 1998 ). The present study showed that fluvastatin reduced blood pressure, the left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in the SHRs. These beneficial pleiotropic effects of fluvastatin may have an important implication in clinical medicine. Cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis are common responses to cardiac injury and overload ( Cohn et al., 2000; Simko, 2002 ). It has been suggested that about two thirds of myocardial cells are fibroblasts and that they are responsible for the production and deposition of the majority of extracellular matrix proteins that mainly include fibronectins, vitronectins and collagens ( Grove et al., 1969; Khan and Sheppard, 2006 ). Collagen I accounts for 80% of total collagen newly synthesized from these cells and the other 20% of the collagen is collagen III ( Bashey et al., 1992 ). Multiple stimulations, including static stretch of the cells, can promote fibroblast cell proliferation and collagen synthesis ( Weber and Brilla, 1991 ). Statins, including fluvastatin, were developed to reduce serum lipid levels. However, these drugs have many beneficial pleiotropic effects, such as improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant properties and inhibition of inflammatory responses ( Davignon, 2004 ). The reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by fluvastatin as shown in this study may not be due to its lipid-lowering effects because 10\u00a0mg/kg/day fluvastatin did not change any lipid profile but reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in SHRs. In addition, SHRs had lipid levels comparable to WKY rats but had cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis compared with WKY rats. The beneficial cardiac effects of fluvastatin may involve its effects on the blood pressure. Our study showed that fluvastatin reduced systolic blood pressure of SHRs. The hydroxyproline content was positively correlated with the systolic blood pressure. The left ventricular mass index was also positively correlated with the systolic blood pressure. These results suggest that the reduction of blood pressure by fluvastatin may contribute to its attenuation of cardiac fibrosis. Statins have been shown to reduce blood pressure in SHRs ( Sicard et al., 2005 ). Conflicting evidence regarding whether statins have hypotensive effects in humans is provided by early studies ( Glorioso et al., 1999; Muramatsu et al., 1997 ). Recent studies have shown that statins decrease blood pressure of patients with hypertension but do not affect blood pressure in normotensive patients ( Ferrier et al., 2002; Sever et al., 2003; Terzoli et al., 2005 ). Consistent with these human data, we show that fluvastatin decreases blood pressure in SHRs but not in WKY rats. Thus, decreasing blood pressure in hypertensive animals and human may be one of the pleiotropic effects of Statins. Statins have been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction and increase nitric oxide bioavailability under various pathological conditions ( Davignon, 2004; Mason et al., 2004 ). These effects may be the underlying mechanisms for statins to decrease blood pressure. The mechanisms underlying cardiac fibrosis in hypertensive heart are not fully understood. Available evidence suggests that activation of the rennin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system and the increased pressure load contribute to the pathological process. Angiotensin II, by activating its downstream molecules including TGF-\u03b21 and aldosterone, is fibrogenic ( Johar et al., 2006; Lijnen and Petrov, 2000; Ramires et al., 1998; Rosenkranz, 2004 ). Pressure overload stretches fibroblast cells, which can promote collagen synthesis ( Weber and Brilla, 1991 ). Reduction of blood pressure by fluvastatin should decrease the cardiac load and stretch and the activation of the rennin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system and should subsequently attenuate the left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis. One of the pleiotropic effects of stains is anti-inflammatory effects ( Davignon, 2004 ). The proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2, can promote cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy ( Hinglais et al., 1994; Shioi et al., 1997 ). Statins reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines under various pathological conditions including high-salt diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy in Dahl rats ( Hasegawa et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004 ). Thus, the anti-inflammatory effects of fluvastatin may contribute to the reduction of the ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in our study. To determine the cellular factors that mediate the fluvastatin-induced reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in the SHR, we focused on the TGF-\u03b21 expression. It has been shown that hypertrophic stimuli, such as increased cardiac load, increase the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in the cardiomyocytes and myocardial fibroblasts ( Takahashi et al., 1994 ). TGF-\u03b21 can then induce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis by regulating cell differentiation and growth and stimulating the synthesis and deposition of the extracellular matrix components, such as collagens. Studies have implicated the importance of TGF-\u03b21 during the development of ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in hypertensive hearts ( Kuwahara et al., 2002; Rosenkranz et al., 2002 ). Angiotensin II, a peptide that contributes significantly to the pathology of hypertensive hearts, induces the expression of TGF-\u03b21 to cause cardiac hypotrophy and fibrosis ( Campbell and Katwa, 1997; Schultz et al., 2002; Tokuda et al., 2004 ). We showed here that SHRs had an increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and cardiac hypotrophy and fibrosis compared with WKY rats, that fluvastatin treatment reduced the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in the left ventricles of SHRs and that the cardiac fibrosis was positively correlated to the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in those rats. Thus, our results suggest that fluvastatin reduces the expression of TGF-\u03b21 to attenuate the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in the SHRs. TGF-\u03b21 binds and activates its receptors ( Massague, 1990 ). The activated TGF-\u03b21 receptor phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads: Smad 2 and Smad 3). Activated R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad 4, the common mediator Smad. These complexes then translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors to control gene expression ( Kretzschmar and Massague, 1998; Labbe et al., 1998 ). Smad 7, an inhibitory Smad, can form a stable binding complex with the activated TGF-\u03b2 receptor. This binding prevents the receptor activation of R-Smads ( Derynck and Zhang, 2003 ). It has been shown that the reduced Smad 7 expression contributes to the development of cardiac fibrosis in rats after myocardial infarction ( Wang et al., 2002 ). In the present study, the Smad 7 expression level in the heart of SHRs is lower than that in the heart of WKY rats. SHRs had cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our results, along with the data showing the role of Smad 7 in the cardiac fibrosis after infarction ( Wang et al., 2002 ), suggest that the reduced Smad 7 expression contributes to the hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. This suggestion is strengthened by our findings that fluvastatin increased the Smad 7 expression and reduced the left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis and that the Smad 7 protein expression is negatively correlated with the hydroxyproline content in the hearts of SHRs. The expression of Smad 7 can be induced by TGF-\u03b21 ( Landstrom et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2002 ). This forms an autoregulatory negative feedback loop to regulate the TGF-\u03b21 signaling. However, SHRs had an increased TGF-\u03b21 expression and a decreased Smad 7 expression. A similar expression pattern of TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 was found in rat hearts after infarction, although the expression of both TGF-\u03b21 and Smad 7 was increased transiently within a few hours after the infarction ( Wang et al., 2002 ). It was proposed that persistent increase of TGF-\u03b21 expression may decrease the expression of Smad 7 in viable cardiac tissues and that this effect may not be necessary through the TGF-\u03b21 signaling per se ( Wang et al., 2002 ). Indeed, the expression of Smad 7 can be regulated by other factors, such as interferon-\u03b3 ( Ulloa et al., 1999 ). Our results showed that fluvastatin treatment reduced the TGF-\u03b21 expression and increased Smad 7 expression in the SHRs. The mechanisms for these effects are not known. Statins have been shown to block the synthesis of various isoprenoid intermediates, such as geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate, that play a critical role in the activation of small GTP-binding proteins, including Rho, Ras, and Rac, through their isoprenylation and may work as lipid attachments for their post-translational modification ( Davignon, 2004 ). A broad range of intracellular signaling pathways may then be modified by statins. In conclusion, fluvastatin decreased hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. These effects may not involve its lipid-lowering effects and may be mediated by its blood pressure-lowering effects. The cellular responses for these beneficial effects may involve down-regulation of the TGF-\u03b21 expression and up-regulation of Smad 7 expression. Clinical studies should be set up to evaluate these beneficial effects of fluvastatin in the hypertensive patients.

The multi-stage cold forging process, which could improve the mechanical properties of the parts, is used to replace the traditional machining process. The process designs of multi-stage cold forging process for parts have been studied, including several operations such as annealing, initial upsetting, preforming, back extrusion, ironing, and upsetting flange. In order to ensure the multi-stage cold forging process, one finite element (FE) simulation, used to study strain distributions and flow lines, is conducted. Based on the FE results, several cold forging dies have been designed and manufactured. The experimental work shows that the cold work-hardening effect is obtained, and distribution of flow lines is reasonable; precision accuracy and mechanical properties meet the technical requirements, and production efficiency has been improved significantly.",

        "abstract": "Charge accumulation on the surface of epoxy resin affects the insulation performance under DC voltage. In order to illustrate the effect of surface coating on the characteristics of surface charge accumulation in epoxy resin, micron and nano SiO 2 /epoxy composite coatings were deposited on the surface of epoxy resin by spraying, and the charge accumulation on the surface was studied by the electrostatic probe method. The surface trap parameters were analyzed by the method of isothermal surface potential decay combining with the carrier mobility and cross-section morphology of samples, the transport characteristics of surface charge and the respective control mechanism of coating layer were studied. The results suggest that the surface charge mainly accumulates near the electrodes, the main source of charges is injected from the electrodes. The surface charges near the anode are caused by charge trapping, and the surface charges near the cathode are caused by the adsorption due to the normal electric field. Surface charge accumulation can be suppressed by increasing the shallow trap density and carrier mobility on the surface of material, which is available by coating with micron and nano SiO 2 /epoxy composites. It was found that, surface charge of epoxy resin could be suppressed effectively by coating of micron SiO 2 particles with content of 1~3 wt%, or nano SiO 2 particles with content of 3 wt%.",
