        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is one of the most essential macronutrients required for plant growth. Although it is abundant in soil, P is often the limiting nutrient for crop yield potential because of the low concentration of soluble P that plants can absorb directly. The gene expression profile was investigated in rice roots at 6, 24 and 72 h under low P stress and compared with a control (normal P) profile, using a DNA chip of 60000 oligos (70 mer) that represented all putative genes of the rice genome. A total of 795 differentially expressed genes were identified in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation in at least one of the treatments. Based on the analysis, we found that: (i) The genes coding for the Pi transporter, acid phosphatase and RNase were up-regulated in rice roots; (ii) the genes involved in glycolysis were first up-regulated and then down-regulated; (iii) several genes involved in N metabolism and lipid metabolism changed their expression patterns; (iv) some genes involved in cell senescence and DNA or protein degradation were up-regulated; and (v) some transmembrane transporter genes were up-regulated. The results may provide useful information in the molecular process associated with Pi deficiency and thus facilitate research in improving Pi utilization in crop species.",

        "abstract": "Wide compatibility varieties (WCVs) are a special class of rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm that produces hybrids with normal pollen and spikelet fertility when crossed with both indica and japonica subspecies. The wide compatibility gene S5 n has been used extensively in intersubspecific hybrid breeding programs. We previously mapped the S5 locus to a 2.2-cM genomic region between RM253 and R2349 on chromosome 6, using a population of 356 F1 plants derived from the three-way cross 02428/Nanjing11//Balilla. In this study, a chromosome walking strategy was employed to construct a physical map covering this genomic region using these two closest markers as the starting points. A physical map consisting of six overlapping BAC clones was formed, spanning a genomic region of 540-kb in length. By analyzing recombination events from a population of 8,000 F1 plants derived from a three-way cross based on near isogenic lines of the S5 locus, the S5 locus was localized to a DNA fragment of 40-kb in length, flanked by two shotgun subclones, 7B1 and 15D2. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted five open reading frames, encoding xyloglucan fucosyltransferases, dnak-type molecular chaperone BiP, a putative eukaryotic aspartyl protease, and a hypothetical protein. This result will be very useful in molecular cloning of the S5 n allele and marker-assisted transferring of the wide compatibility gene in rice breeding programs. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",

        "abstract": "Tracking and identifying the dynamic patterns of evolving communities has recently drawn great attention. How to detect the community structure in a dynamic network has become a popular problem in the field of complex network and evolutionary computing. As a new concept, evolutionary clustering, is proposed to detect the process of dynamic networks under the temporal smoothness framework. Evolutionary-based clustering approaches try to maximize clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimize clustering drift at two successive time steps. But the low accuracy and the pre-setting of parameters limit their effectiveness. In order to overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, the community detection in a dynamic network is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem. Specifically, we propose a novel decomposition strategy for multiobjective discrete particle swarm optimizationm, which balances the accuracy and the smoothness. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Many plants have evolved a drought escape (DE) mechanism to shorten their life cycle when facing water-deficit conditions. While drought tolerance has been intensively investigated, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of DE remain elusive. We found that low water-deficit treatment (LWT) at the early stage of rice development can trigger early flowering and reduced tiller numbers. LWT induced the accumulation of ABA which in turn feedback affected the light perception and circadian clock by synchronously regulating many flowering-related genes to promote early flowering. Moreover, some of the light receptors, circadian components, and flowering-related genes including OsTOC1, Ghd7, and PhyB were found to be involved in LWT in an ABA-dependent manner, whereas some of the other flowering-related genes including OsGI, OsELF3, OsPRR37, and OsMADS50 were involved in the regulation of DE independent of ABA. In addition, we found that strigolactones and OsTB1 are involved in the tillering inhibition under LWT, which is independent of the flowering pathway in rice. Taken together, our findings provide compelling evidence that DE in rice is coordinately regulated by multiple pathways in the reproduction (flowering) switch.",

        "abstract": "Tolerance to low nitrogen conditions is a highly desired characteristic for sustainable crop production. In this study, we analyzed the genetic components associated with low N tolerance in rice at seedling stage, including main effects, epistatic effects of the quantitative trait locus (QTLs), and QTL by environment interactions (QEs), using a population of 239 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, the parents of an elite hybrid. A genetic linkage map with 253 DNA maker loci was constructed. Seedlings of RILs were cultivated in low N and normal N solutions. Root, shoot and plant weight in the two N treatments were measured and the relative weight of the two treatments for each trait was considered as measurements for low N tolerance. Four to eight QTLs with main effects were detected for each of the nine traits. Very few QTLs were detected in both low and normal N conditions, and most QTLs for the relative measurements were different from those for traits under the two N treatments, indicating very little commonality in the genetic basis of the traits and their relative performance under low and normal N conditions. A total of 103 digenic interactions were detected for the nine traits. While the epistatic effects collectively accounted for large proportions of the variation for several traits, the effects of QEs appeared to be trivial. It was concluded that low N tolerance of rice seedling had complex genetic basis that requires extensive studies for full characterization.",

        "abstract": "Although allelic diversity of genes has been shown to contribute to many phenotypic variations associated with different physiological processes in plants, information on allelic diversity of abiotic stress-responsive genes is limited. Here it is shown that the alleles OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 play different roles in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and salt stress adaptation in rice. The two alleles had different transcriptional responses to ABA and salt stresses. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas OsWRKY45-1-knockout lines showed increased ABA sensitivity. OsWRKY45-1 transgenic plants showed no obvious difference from negative controls in response to salt stress. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing lines showed increased ABA sensitivity and reduced salt stress tolerance, and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt stress tolerance. OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 transgenic plants showed differential expression of a set of ABA- and abiotic stress-responsive genes, but they showed similar responses to cold and drought stresses. These results suggest that OsWRKY45-1 negatively and OsWRKY45-2 positively regulates ABA signalling and, in addition, OsWRKY45-2 but not OsWRKY45-1 negatively regulates rice response to salt stress. The different roles of the two alleles in ABA signalling and salt stress may be due to their transcriptional mediation of different signalling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The improvement of grain quality, such as protein content (PC) and amino acid composition, has been a major concern of rice breeders. We constructed a population of 190 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Nanyangzhan to map the quantitative trait locus or loci (QTL) for amino acid content (AAC) as characterized by each of the AACs, total essential AAC, and all AAC. Using the data collected from milled rice in 2002 and 2004, we identified 18 chromosomal regions for 19 components of AAC. For 13 of all the loci, the Zhenshan 97 allele increased the trait values. Most QTL were co-localized, forming ten QTL clusters in 2002 and six in 2004. The QTL clusters varied in both effects and locations, and the mean values of variation explained by individual QTL in the clusters ranged from 4.3% to 28.82%. A relatively strong QTL cluster, consisting of up to 19 individual QTL, was found at the bottom of chromosome 1. The major QTL clusters identified for two different years were coincident. A wide coincidence was found between the QTL we detected and the loci involved in amino acid metabolism pathways, including N assimilation and transfer, and amino acid or protein biosynthesis. The results will be useful for candidate gene identification and marker-assisted favorable allele transfer in rice breeding programs. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

        "abstract": "The GS3 locus located in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 3 has been frequently identified as a major QTL for both grain\n weight (a yield trait) and grain length (a quality trait) in the literature. Near isogenic lines of GS3 were developed by successive crossing and backcrossing Minghui 63 (large grain) with Chuan 7 (small grain), using Minghui\n 63 as the recurrent parent. Analysis of a random subpopulation of 201 individuals from the BC3F2 progeny confirmed that the GS3 locus explained 80–90% of the variation for grain weight and length in this population. In addition, this locus was resolved\n as a minor QTL for grain width and thickness. Using 1,384 individuals with recessive phenotype (large grain) from a total\n of 5,740 BC3F2 plants and 11 molecular markers based on sequence information, GS3 was mapped to a DNA fragment approximately 7.9 kb in length. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the target region was identified,\n which provided complete sequence information for the GS3 candidate. This gene consists of five exons and encodes 232 amino acids with a putative PEBP-like domain, a transmembrane\n region, a putative TNFR/NGFR family cysteine-rich domain and a VWFC module. Comparative sequencing analysis identified a nonsense\n mutation, shared among all the large-grain varieties tested in comparison with the small grain varieties, in the second exon\n of the putative GS3 gene. This mutation causes a 178-aa truncation in the C-terminus of the predicted protein, suggesting that GS3 may function\n as a negative regulator for grain size. Cloning of such a gene provided the opportunity for fully characterizing the regulatory\n mechanism and related processes during grain development.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating information indicates that plant disease resistance signaling pathways frequently interact with other pathways regulating developmental processes or abiotic stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms of these types of crosstalk remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we report that OsWRKY13, an activator of rice resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, appears to function as a convergent point for crosstalk among the pathogen-induced salicylate-dependent defense pathway and five other physiologic pathways. Genome-wide analysis of the expression profiles of OsWRKY13-overexpressing lines suggests that OsWRKY13 directly or indirectly regulates the expression of more than 500 genes that are potentially involved in different physiologic processes according to the classification of the Gene Ontology database. By comparing the expression patterns of genes functioning in known pathways or cellular processes of pathogen infection and the phenotypes between OsWRKY13-overexpressing and wild-type plants, our data suggest that OsWRKY13 is also a regulator of other physiologic processes during pathogen infection. The OsWRKY13-associated disease resistance pathway synergistically interacts via OsWRKY13 with the glutathione/glutaredoxin system and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway to monitor redox homeostasis and to putatively enhance the biosynthesis of antimicrobial flavonoid phytoalexins, respectively, in OsWRKY13-overexpressing lines. Meanwhile, the OsWRKY13-associated disease resistance pathway appears to interact antagonistically with the SNAC1-mediated abiotic stress defense pathway, jasmonic acid signaling pathway, and terpenoid metabolism pathway via OsWRKY13 to suppress salt and cold defense responses as well as to putatively retard rice growth and development.",

        "abstract": "The rice disease resistance (R) gene Xa3/Xa26 (having also been named Xa3 and Xa26) against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight disease, belongs to a multiple gene family clustered in chromosome 11 and is from an AA genome rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L.). This family encodes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type proteins. Here, we show that the orthologs (alleles) of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3, from wild Oryza species O. officinalis (CC genome) and O. minuta (BBCC genome), respectively, were also R genes against Xoo. Xa3/Xa26-2 and Xa3/Xa26-3 conferred resistance to 16 of the 18 Xoo strains examined. Comparative sequence analysis of the Xa3/Xa26 families in the two wild Oryza species showed that Xa3/Xa26-3 appeared to have originated from the CC genome of O. minuta. The predicted proteins encoded by Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3 share 91-99% sequence identity and 94-99% sequence similarity. Transgenic plants carrying a single copy of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, or Xa3/Xa26-3, in the same genetic background, showed a similar resistance spectrum to a set of Xoo strains, although plants carrying Xa3/Xa26-2 or Xa3/Xa26-3 showed lower resistance levels than the plants carrying Xa3/Xa26. These results suggest that the Xa3/Xa26 locus predates the speciation of A and C genome, which is approximately 7.5 million years ago. Thus, the resistance specificity of this locus has been conserved for a long time.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of Earthworm decoction on the airway inflammation of experimental bronchial asthma in guinea pigs and inquire into the mechanism in the decoction.Forty-eight guinea pigs were randomly divided into six groups: the control group, the model group, the dexamethasone group, the Xiaoqinglong decoction group, the earthworm decoction large dosage group and the Earthworm decoction low dosage group, 8 guinea pigs in each group. Except the control group, the other groups were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) by a combination of intraperitional injection and repeated intranasal challenges to establish the guinea pigs asthma model. However, in the control group, normal saline was used. The morphological changes of bronchial tube, the lung tectology and the inflammation germ cell quantity of eosinophils (Eos), lymphocytes (Ly), neutrophils (Neu) and total blood cells in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavaga fluid (BALF) were examinated in each group respectively.The levels of Eos, Ly, Neu and total cell quantity in the blood and BALF after the earthworm decoction treatment in the large dosage group were significantly lower than those in the model group (P <0.01), and in the low dosage group were lower too (P <0.05). The Earthworm decoction large dosage could obviously improve the bronchial tube epidermis damage, the mucous membrane gland proliferation and hydrops, asthma pathology change and basilar membrane accumulation. Eos apoptosis was obsered in the bronchoalveolar, blood and BALF. The Earthworm decoction small dosage had a similar effect but slightly to the large dosage.The Earthworm decoction can lighten the airway inflammation in asthmatic guinea pigs, its mechanism is related with the inhibition of Eos infiltration, acceleration of Eos apoptosis and improvement of the bronchial tube and the lung tectology changes. The effect of the decoction is dose-dependent.",

        "abstract": "Although 109 WRKY genes have been identified in the rice genome, the functions of most are unknown. Here, we show that OsWRKY13 plays a pivotal role in rice disease resistance. Overexpression of OsWRKY13 can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility. This overexpression was accompanied by the activation of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes and SA-responsive genes and the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes and JA-responsive genes. OsWRKY13 bound to the promoters of its own and at least three other genes in SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways. Its DNA-binding activity was influenced by pathogen infection. These results suggest that OsWRKY13, as an activator of the SA-dependent pathway and a suppressor of JA-dependent pathways, mediates rice resistance by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a subset of genes acting both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. Furthermore, OsWRKY13 will provide a transgenic tool for engineering wider-spectrum and whole-growth-stage resistance rice in breeding programs.",

Several aspects of plant growth and development are rigidly governed by auxin, from micro to macro hierarchies; auxin also has a close relationship with plant-pathogen interactions. Undoubtedly, precise auxin levels are vitally important to plants, which have many effective mechanisms to maintain auxin homeostasis. One mechanism is conjugating amino acid to excessive indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; main form of auxin) through some GH3 family proteins to inactivate it. Our previous study demonstrated that GH3-2 mediated broad-spectrum resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation and downregulating auxin signaling. Here, we further investigated the expression pattern of GH3-2 and other GH3 family paralogues in the life cycle of rice and presented the possible function of GH3-2 on rice root development by histochemical analysis of GH3-2 promoter:GUS reporter transgenic plants.",

        "abstract": "The ability to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in a bi-allelic population is often limited. The power of QTL detection\n and identification of the most beneficial allele at each QTL could be greatly improved by comparing QTLs among different populations\n derived from connecting multi-parents. In this study, three sets of connected recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from\n the crosses between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 (PZM), Zhenshan 97 and Teqing (PZT), and Minghui 63 and Teqing (PMT), respectively,\n were used. QTL analyses for the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and 1,000-grain weight (TGW) were performed in PZT,\n and five SPP QTLs on chromosomes 1, 6, and 7 and two TGW QTLs on chromosome 1 were detected. QTL for SPP was also identified\n in PMT, and six QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in this population. In an earlier study, we identified\n five SPP QTLs and four TGW QTLs in PMT and nine TGW QTLs in PZM. Comparison of the QTL mapping results of these two studies\n showed that one QTL was common to the three populations, 11 QTLs were detected in two populations, and six QTLs were found\n in only one population. Comparison of genetic effect and the action direction of the QTLs detected in the three populations\n showed that additive effects of QTLs estimated in different populations were also expressed additively among three parental\n alleles. Additive effects of SPP7a estimated in three near-isogenic line F2 populations supported this finding. Based on these results, we suggest that pyramiding the most beneficial alleles among\n the three parents could efficiently improve rice yield.",

        "abstract": "Development-controlled resistance and resistance specificity frequently restrict the application of a disease resistance (R) gene in crop breeding programs. Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21, encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-kinase type plasma membrane proteins, mediate race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases. Plants carrying Xa3/Xa26 and plants carrying Xa21 have different resistance spectra and the functions of the two R genes are regulated by developmental stage. Four chimeric genes encoding proteins consisting of different parts of XA3/XA26\n and XA21 were constructed by domain swapping and transformed into a susceptible rice variety. The resistance spectra and development-regulated\n resistance of the transgenic plants carrying Xa3/Xa26, Xa21, or chimeric gene to different Xoo strains were analyzed in the same genetic background. The results suggest that the gradually increased expression of Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21 plays an important role in the progressively enhanced Xoo resistance during rice development. In addition, the LRR domains of XA3/XA26 and XA21 are important determinants of race-specific\n recognition during rice–Xoo interaction, but juxtamembrane regions of the two R proteins also appear to contribute to resistance specificity.",

These proteins are localised in the nucleus and the genes encoding them are differentially expressed in different tissues, further suggesting their putative roles in regulating gene expression. These results suggest that the green tissue-specific expression of the D54O gene may be regulated by the interaction of multiple proteins with cis elements in the promoter region.",

        "abstract": "Community detection, an effective tool to analyze and understand network data, has been paid more and more attention in recent years. One of the most popular methods of detecting community structure is to find the division with the maximal modularity. However, the modularity maximization is an NP-complete problem. In the field of swarm intelligence algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely used to solve such NP-complete problem. Nevertheless, premature convergence and lower accuracy limit its performance in community detection. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel PSO called P-PSO for community detection through combining the computational ability of Physarum, a kind of slime. The proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of PSO by recognizing inter-community edges based on Physarum-inspired network model (PNM). Experiments in eight networks show that the proposed algorithm is effective and promising for community detection, compared with other algorithms.",

Here, we show that overexpression of stress responsive gene SNAC1 (STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC 1) significantly enhances drought resistance in transgenic rice (22-34% higher seed setting than control) in the field under severe drought stress conditions at the reproductive stage while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty. The transgenic rice also shows significantly improved drought resistance and salt tolerance at the vegetative stage. Compared with WT, the transgenic rice are more sensitive to abscisic acid and lose water more slowly by closing more stomatal pores, yet display no significant difference in the rate of photosynthesis. SNAC1 is induced predominantly in guard cells by drought and encodes a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor with transactivation activity. DNA chip analysis revealed that a large number of stress-related genes were up-regulated in the SNAC1-overexpressing rice plants. Our data suggest that SNAC1 holds promising utility in improving drought and salinity tolerance in rice.",

        "abstract": "The subgenus Soja includes wild, semi-wild and cultivated soybeans, of which the semi-wild soybean is the most abundant morphologically and overlaps with wild and cultivated soybeans in morphology. However, semi-wild soybean has been retained inconsistent in its taxonomic belongingness between other two species. In this research, we evaluated the genetic differentiation in the subgenus Soja and determined the assignment of semi-wild soybean using 421 accessions of wild (two groups), semi-wild (three groups) and\"Moshidou\"-type soybean landrace (one group). The results showed that small-seeded (below 2.5 g 100-seed weight) and large-seeded (2.51～3.0 g 100-seed weight) wild soybeans had significantly genetic differentiations. The genetic relationship between large-seeded wild soybean and small-seeded semi-wild soybean (3.01～5.0 g 100-seed weight) was closer, that between larger-seeded semi-wild soybean (5.01～10.0 g 100-seed weight) and large-seeded semi-wild soybean (over 10.0 g 100-seed weight) was close too, and also between large-seeded wild soybean and semi-wild soybean genetically. The degrees of genetic differentiation from small-seed wild soybean to large-seeded semi-wild soybean were related to their seed sizes for various seed size types; even the semi-wild soybeans that overlapped with or exceeded \"Moshidou\"in100-seedweighthadsignificantlygeneticdifferencesfromthe \"Moshidou\".Therefore,theresults obtained here clearly stated that semi-wild soybean is an intraspecies variant of wild soybean but not of cultivated soybeans. The 100-seed weight showed genetic evidence that seed size could be used as an index of evolutionary degree in the subgenus Soja soybeans. The 100-seed weight showed genetic evidence that seed size could be used as an index of evolutionary degree in the subgenus Soja.",

        "abstract": "Community mining is a powerful tool for discovering the knowledge of networks and has a wide application. The modularity is one of very popular measurements for evaluating the efficiency of community divisions. However, the modularity maximization is a NP-complete problem. As an effective optimization algorithm for solving NP-complete problems, ant colony based community detection algorithm has been proposed to deal with such task. However the low accuracy and premature still limit its performance. Aiming to overcome those shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel nature-inspired optimization for the community mining based on the Physarum, a kind of slime molds cells. In the proposed strategy, the Physarum-inspired model optimizes the heuristic factor of ant colony algorithm by endowing edges with weights. With the information of weights provided by the Physarum-inspired model, the optimized heuristic factor can improve the searching abilities of ant colony algorithms. Four real-world networks and two typical kinds of ant colony optimization algorithms are used for estimating the efficiency of proposed strategy. Experiments show that the optimized ant colony optimization algorithms can achieve a better performance in terms of robustness and accuracy with a lower computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Many plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas rely largely on secreting virulence transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) proteins into plant nucleus to activate host susceptibility genes to cause disease, the process is dependent on pathogen TALEs association with host plants basal transcription factor IIA small subunit TFIIAγ. TFIIAγ together with large subunit TFIIAαβ constitute as a key component of RNA polymerase II complex for transcriptome initiation. However, whether TFIIAαβ coordinates or competes with pathogen TALEs for interaction with TFIIAγ to activate transcript of TALEs-targeting genes is unclear. Here, we showed that TALE-carrying bacterial pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), the causal agent for bacterial leaf blight and bacterial leaf streak in rice, using their major virulence TALEs to physically associate with N-terminal of OsTFIIAγ5. OsTFIIAα and OsTFIIAβ which are post-translationally mature proteins of OsTFIIAαβ separately bound to N- and C-terminal of OsTFIIAγ5. OsTFIIAα coordinated with TALEs for binding with OsTFIIAγ5 to upregulate rice susceptibility genes to cause disease. Conversely, suppression of OsTFIIAαβ attenuated TALEs-targeting genes transcription, thus improved broad-spectrum disease resistance of rice to Xoo and Xoc. These results provide an applicable strategy for improving resistance to TALE-carrying pathogens in rice by appropriate suppression of plant basal transcription factors expression.",

        "abstract": "Despite the importance of quantitative disease resistance during a plant's life, little is known about the molecular basis of this type of host-pathogen interaction, because most of the genes underlying resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are unknown. To identify genes contributing to resistance QTLs in rice, we analyzed the colocalization of a set of characterized rice defense-responsive genes and resistance QTLs against different pathogens. We also examined the expression patterns of these genes in response to pathogen infection in the parents of the mapping populations, based on the strategy of validation and functional analysis of the QTLs. The results suggest that defense-responsive genes are important resources of resistance QTLs in rice. OsWRKY45-1 is the gene contributing to a major resistance QTL. NRR, OsGH3-1, and OsGLP members on chromosome 8 contribute alone or collectively to different minor resistance QTLs. These genes function in a basal resistance pathway or in major disease resistance gene-mediated race-specific pathways.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To explore the effect of Wuwei Earthworm decoction on serum interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and interleukine-4(IL-4) at asthmatic attack.Methods: Forty-eight guinea pigs were randomly divided into six groups with 8 guinea pigs in each group: normal control group,asthmatic model group,dexamethasone group, Wuwei Earthworm decoction groups with low dose,middle dose and high dose.The asthmatic model of guinea pigs was established by intraperitionally injecting OVA and intranasally inhaling OVA.Fifteen days later,the guinea pigs were administered the decoction once a day for 8 days.The intracarotid blood was taken and centrifugated at 3000 γ min-1 for 10 mins.Then,the levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 were determined with guinea pigs IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISA kits.Results: Levels of serum IFN-γ in earthworm decoction group with high dose(35.06±2.83) pg.ml-1, earthworm decoction group with middle dose(29.74±1.84) pg.ml-1,earthworm decoction group with low dose(28.80±1.36) pg.ml-1,and dexamethasone group(39.08±1.06) pg.ml-1 were significantly enhanced as compared with that in the model group(18.74±2.22) pg.ml-1(all P<0.01).But it was not significantly enhanced as compared with that in the normal control group(35.41±2.31) pg.ml-1(P>0.05). Levels of serum IL-4 in earthworm decoction group with high dose(9.27±0.86) pg.ml-1,and earthworm decoction group with middle dose(9.40±2.91) pg.ml-1 were significantly decreased as compared with that in the model group(13.37±1.86) pg.ml-1(all P<0.01).The effect in the high dose group was better than that in the low dose group.Conclusion: Wuwei Earthworm decoction can increase the serum IFN-γ level and reduce serum IL-4 level,and regulate the imbalance between IFN-γ and IL-4 at asthmatic attack.This may be one of the mechanisms that earthworm decoction is effective when treating airway inflammation through inhibiting the release of inflammation media.The effect of earthworm decoction is positively related to dose.",

        "abstract": "Plant responses to abiotic stresses are coordinated by arrays of growth and developmental programs. Phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) play critical roles in developmental progresses and environmental responses through complex signalling networks. However, crosstalk between the two hormones at the biosynthesis level remains largely unknown. Here, we report that carotenoid-deficient mutants (phs1, phs2, phs3-1, phs4, and PDS-RNAi transgenic rice) were impaired in the biosynthesis of ABA and IAA. Under drought conditions, phs3-1 and PDS-RNAi transgenic rice showed larger stomata aperture and earlier wilting compared to the wild type at both seedling and panicle developmental stage. Interestingly, these carotenoid-deficient lines showed increased cold resistance, which was likely due to the combined effects of reduced IAA content, alleviated oxidative damage and decreased membrane penetrability. Furthermore, we found that IAA content was significantly declined in rice treated with fluridone (a carotenoid and ABA biosynthesis inhibitor), and expression of auxin synthesis and metabolism-related genes were altered in the fluridone-treated rice similar to that in the carotenoid-deficient mutants. In addition, exogenous IAA, but not ABA, could restore the dwarf phenotype of phs3-1 and PDS-RNAi transgenic rice. These results support a crosstalk between ABA and IAA at the biosynthesis level, and this crosstalk is involved in development and differentially affects drought and cold tolerance in rice.",

        "abstract": "Plant disease resistant (R) genes are frequently clustered in the genome. The diversity of members in a complex R-gene family may provide variation in resistance specificity. Rice Xa3/Xa26, conferring resistance to Xanthomonas\n oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein and belongs to a multigene family, consisting of Xa3/Xa26, MRKa, MRKc and MRKd in rice cultivar Minghui 63. MRKa and MRKc are intact genes, while MRKd is a pseudogene. Complementary analyses showed that MRKa and MRKc could not mediate resistance to Xoo when regulated by their native promoters, but MRKa not MRKc conferred partial resistance to Xoo when regulated by a strong constitutive promoter. Plants carrying truncated XA3/XA26, which lacked the kinase domain, were\n compromised in their resistance to Xoo. However, the kinase domain of MRKa could partially restore the function of the truncated XA3/XA26 in resistance. MRKa and MRKc showed similar expression pattern as Xa3/Xa26, which expressed only in the vascular systems of different tissues. The expressional characteristic of MRKa and MRKc perfectly fits the function of genes conferring resistance to Xoo, a vascular pathogen. These results suggest that although MRKa and MRKc cannot mediate bacterial blight resistance nowadays, they may be once effective genes for Xoo resistance. Their expressional characteristic and sequence similarity to Xa3/Xa26 will provide templates for generating novel recognition specificity to face the evolution of Xoo. In addition, both LRR and kinase domains encoded by Xa3/Xa26 and MRKa are the functional determinants and MRKa-mediated resistance is dosage-dependent.",

        "abstract": "Drought and salt stresses are major limiting factors for crop production. To identify critical genes for stress resistance in rice (Oryza sativa L.), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought- and salt-hypersensitive mutant dsm3. The mutant phenotype was caused by a T-DNA insertion in a gene encoding a putative inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase previously named OsITPK2 with unknown function. Under drought stress conditions, the mutant had significantly less accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and soluble sugar and showed significantly reduced root volume, spikelet fertility, biomass, and grain yield; however, malondialdehyde level was increased in the mutant. Interestingly, overexpression of DSM3 (OsITPK2) in rice resulted in drought- and salt-hypersensitive phenotypes and physiological changes similar to those in the mutant. Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) level was decreased in the overexpressors under normal condition and drought stress. A few genes related to osmotic adjustment and reactive oxygen species scavenging were down-regulated in the mutant and overexpression lines. The expression level of DSM3 promoter-driven β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in rice was induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid. Protoplast transient expression assay indicated that DSM3 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein. Sequence analysis revealed six putative ITPKs in rice. Transcript level analysis of OsITPK genes revealed that they had different tempo-spatial expression patterns, and the responses of DSM3 to abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, and high temperature, were distinct from the other five members in rice. These results together suggest that DSM3/OsITPK2 is an important member of the OsITPK family for stress responses, and an optimal expression level is essential for drought and salt tolerance in rice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

        "abstract": "Aspartic proteases (APs) comprise a large proteolytic enzyme family widely distributed in animals, microbes, viruses, and plants. The rice genome encodes 96 APs, of which only a few have been functionally characterized. Here, the identification and characterization of a novel AP gene, OsAP65, which plays an indispensable role in pollen tube growth in rice, is reported. The T-DNA insertion line of OsAP65 caused severe segregation distortion. In the progeny derived from an individual heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion, the wild type and T-DNA-carrying heterozygote segregated at a ratio close to 1:1, while homozygotes of disrupted OsAP65 (OsAP65-/-) were not recovered. Reciprocal crosses between heterozygotes and wild-type plants demonstrated that the mutant alleles could not be transmitted through the male gamete. Examination of the anthers from heterozygous plants revealed that the mutant pollen matured normally, but did not germinate or elongate. OsAP65 was expressed in various tissues and the transcript level in heterozygous plants was about half of the amount measured in the wild-type plants. The subcellular localization showed that OsAP65 is a pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) protein. These results indicated that OsAP65 was essential for rice pollen germination and tube growth.",

        "abstract": "Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of amino acids. It plays an important role in regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism in almost all organisms. In this study, we over-expressed in rice separately all three AAT genes from rice (OsAAT1~3) and one AAT gene from Escherichia coli (EcAAT). Over-expression was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and constructs were introduced into rice by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Compared with control plants, the transformants showed significantly increased leaf AAT activity and greater seed amino acid and protein contents. No other phenotypic changes were observed. The total leaf AAT activities in plants over-expressing OsAAT1, OsAAT2, and EcAAT were 26.6, 23.6, and 19.6 A min(-1) mg(-1) FW (A: units of activity, defined as increase of absorbency per min per mg; FW: fresh weight), which were significantly higher than that in the wild-type control (17.7 A min(-1) mg(-1) FW). The amino acid content in seeds of transgenic plants over-expressing OsAAT1, OsAAT2, and EcAAT was 119.36, 115.36, and 113.72 mg g(-1), respectively, which were 16.1, 12.0, and 5.4% higher, respectively, than that in the control plants. The transgenic plants over-expressing OsAAT1, OsAAT2, and EcAAT had significantly higher protein contents (increased 22.2, 21.1, and 11.1%, respectively) than wild-type plants. No significant changes were found in leaf AAT activity, seed amino acid content or protein content in OsAAT3 over-expressed plants. The expression patterns of the three OsAAT genes and their different functions are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Increasing crop yield is one of the most important goals of plant science research. Grain size is a major determinant of grain yield in cereals and is a target trait for both domestication and artificial breeding(1). We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight. GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size. Sequencing of the promoter region in 51 rice accessions from a wide geographic range identified three haplotypes that seem to be associated with grain width. The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops(2).",

Annotation and comparison of the sequences of the two clones resulted in a total of five potential candidates\n which should be functionally tested. We also conducted comparative analysis of sequences of these two cultivars with two other\n cultivars, Nipponbare and 93-11, for which sequence data were available in public databases. The analysis revealed large differences\n in sequence composition among the four genotypes in the Pms1 region primarily due to retroelement activity leading to rapid recent growth and divergence of the genomes. High levels of\n polymorphism in the forms of indels and SNPs were found both in intra-and inter-subspecific comparisons. Dating analysis using\n LTRs of the retroelements in this region showed that the substitution rate of LTRs was much higher than reported in the literature.\n The results provided strong evidence for rapid genomic evolution of this region as a consequence of natural and artificial\n selection.",

Here we identify a pathway composed of five subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins that regulate grain length in rice. The Gβ protein is essential for plant survival and growth. Gα provides a foundation for grain size expansion. Three Gγ proteins, DEP1, GGC2 and GS3, antagonistically regulate grain size. DEP1 and GGC2, individually or in combination, increase grain length when in complex with Gβ. GS3, having no effect on grain size by itself, reduces grain length by competitively interacting with Gβ. By combining different G-protein variants, we can decrease grain length by up to 35% or increase it by up to 19%, which leads to over 40% decreasing to 28% increasing of grain weight. The wide existence of such a conserved system among angiosperms suggests a possible general predictable approach to manipulating grain/organ sizes.",

Here, by ultrastructural examination of xylem parenchyma cells, we show that resistances to Xoo conferred by dominant MR genes and recessive MR genes resulted in different types of programmed cell death. Three dominant MR genes Xa1, Xa4, and Xa21 and two recessive MR genes xa5 and xa13 that encode very different proteins were used in this study. We observed that Xa1-, Xa4- and Xa21-mediated resistances to Xoo were associated mainly with autophagy-like cell death featured by the formation of autophagosome-like bodies in the xylem parenchyma cells. In contrast, the xa5- and xa13-mediated resistances to Xoo were associated mainly with vacuolar-mediated cell death characterized by tonoplast disruption of the xylem parenchyma cells. Application of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine partially compromised Xa1-, Xa4-, and Xa21-mediated resistances, as did Na2HPO4 alkaline solution to xa5- and xa13-mediated resistances. These results suggest that autophagy-like cell death is a feature of the dominant MR gene-mediated resistance to Xoo and vacuolar-mediated cell death is a characteristic of the recessive MR gene-mediated resistance.",

        "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) during tapetum degeneration in postmeiotic anthers is critical for the proper development of male gametophytes in flowering plants. Although several genes involved in this process have been identified recently, the molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we show that knockout of rice (Oryza sativa) APOPTOSIS INHIBITOR5 (API5), which encodes a putative homolog of antiapoptosis protein Api5 in animals, results in delayed degeneration of the tapetum due to inhibition of the tapetal PCD process leading to defects in formation of male gametophytes. Os API5 is a nuclear protein that interacts with two DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicases, API5-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (AIP1) and AIP2. AIP1 and AIP2 are homologs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Suppressor of Bad Response to Refrigeration1 protein 2 (SUB2p) that have critical roles in transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing. Os AIP1 and AIP2 can form dimers and interact directly with the promoter region of CP1, a rice cysteine protease gene. Suppression of Os AIP1/2 leads to down-regulation of CP1, resulting in sterility, which is highly similar to the effects of suppressed expression of Os CP1. Our results uncover a previously unknown pathway for regulating PCD during tapetum degeneration in rice, one that may be conserved among eukaryotic organisms.",

However, existing algorithms which are ranging from the optimization-based to model-based strategies still need to be strengthened further in terms of their robustness and accuracy. In this paper, a kind of multi-headed slime molds, Physarum, is used for optimizing genetic algorithm (GA), due to its intelligence of generating foraging networks based on bioresearches. Thus, a Physarum-based Network Model (PNM) is proposed based on the Physarum-based Model, which shows an ability of recognizing inter-community edges. Combining PNM with a genetic algorithm, a novel genetic algorithm, called PNGACD, is putting forward to enhance the GAu0027s efficiency, in which a priori edge recognition of PNM is integrated into the phase of initialization. Moreover, experiments in six real-world networks are used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that there is a remarkable improvement in term of the robustness and accuracy, which demonstrates that PNGACD has a better performance, compared with the existing algorithms.",

However, there is limited information about this family in monocot species. This report identifies 20 TIFY genes in rice, the model monocot species. Sequence analysis indicated that rice TIFY proteins have conserved motifs beyond the TIFY domain as was previously shown in Arabidopsis. On the basis of their protein structures, members of the TIFY family can be divided into two groups. Transcript level analysis of OsTIFY genes in tissues and organs revealed different tempo-spatial expression patterns, suggesting that expression and function vary by stage of plant growth and development. Most of the OsTIFY genes were predominantly expressed in leaf. Nine OsTIFY genes were responsive to jasmonic acid and wounding treatments. Interestingly, almost all the OsTIFY genes were responsive to one or more abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and low temperature. Over-expression of OsTIFY11a, one of the stress-inducible genes, resulted in significantly increased tolerance to salt and dehydration stresses. These results suggest that the OsTIFY family may have important roles in response to abiotic stresses. The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the functions of the genes in the OsTIFY family.",

Recent studies have shown that a load-shedding problem can be solved by formulating it as a 0/1 knapsack problem (KP). Although approximate solutions of 0/1 KP can be given by ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms, adopting them requests a delicate consideration of the robustness, convergence rate and premature convergence. This paper proposes a new kind of  Physarum -based hybrid optimization algorithm, denoted as PM-ACO, based on the critical paths reserved feature of  Physarum -inspired mathematical (PM) model. Through adding additional pheromone to those important items selected by the PM model, PM-ACO improves the selection probability of important items and emerge a positive feedback process to generate optimal solutions. Comparing with other 0/1 KP solving algorithms, our experimental results demonstrate that PM-ACO algorithms have a stronger robustness and a higher convergence rate. Moreover, PM-ACO provides adaptable solutions for the load-shedding problem in a microgrid system.",

Meanwhile, seven different scale datasets related to TSP are used to estimate the performance of NPI strategy. Afterwards, the experimental results show that there is a remarkable improvement in terms of robustness and the quality of the solution. Moreover, the proposed NPI strategy is flexible enough to be combined with multifarious ACO algorithms for solving TSP because of its independence in operation details.",

        "abstract": "The basic characteristics of extreme events are their infrequence and potential damages to the humannature system. It is difficult for people to design comprehensive policies for dealing with such events due to time pressure and their limit knowledge about rare and uncertain sequential impacts. Recently, online media provides digital source of individual and public information to study collective human responses to extreme events, which can help us reduce the damages of an extreme event and improve the efficiency of disaster relief. More specifically, there are different emotional responses (e.g., anxiety and anger) to an event and its subevents during a whole event, which can be reflected in the contents of public news and social media to a certain degree. Therefore, an online computational method for extracting these contents can help us better understand human emotional states at different stages of an event, reveal underlying reasons, and improve the efficiency of event relief. Here, we first employ tweets and reports extracted from Twitter and ReliefWeb for text analysis on three distinct events. Then, we detect textual contents by sentiment lexicon to find out human emotional responses over time. Moreover, a clustering-based method is proposed to detect emotional responses to a certain episode during events based on the co-occurrences of words as used in tweets and/or articles. Taking Japanese earthquake in 2011, Haiti earthquake in 2010 and Swine influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 as case studies, we reveal the underlying reasons of distinct patterns of human emotional responses to the whole events and their episodes.",

Transformants for GS gene (GS1;1, GS1;2, and glnA) in rice were produced by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method, and transcripts of GS gene accumulated at higher levels in the primary transgenic plants. Our results indicated an increased metabolic level in\n GS-overexpressed plants, which showed higher total GS activities and soluble protein concentrations in leaves and higher total\n amino acids and total nitrogen content in the whole plant. Decreases in both grain yield production and total amino acids\n were observed in seeds of GS-overexpressed plants compared with wild-type plants. In addition, GS1;2-overexpressed plants exhibited resistance to Basta selection and higher sensitivity to salt, drought, and cold stress conditions,\n whereas the other two types of GS-overexpressed plants failed to show any significant changes for these stress conditions\n compared with wild-type plants.",

        "abstract": "Stemborers and leaffolders are two groups of lepidopteran pests that cause severe damage to rice in many areas of the world. In this study, a cry1C* gene encoding Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) δ-endotoxin was synthesized by codon optimization as the first step towards gene stacking in our resistance management strategy of transgenic rice. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of this gene into Minghui 63 (Oryza sativa L.), an elite indica CMS restorer line, produced 120 independently transformed plants, 19 of which had a single-copy transgene. Preliminary screening of T1 families of these 19 transformants in the field identified five lines showing a high level of resistance to leaffolders (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and stemborers. Hybrids were produced by crossing these five lines with Zhenshan 97A, the male-sterile line for Shanyou 63, the most widely cultivated hybrid in China. These five lines and their hybrids were highly resistant to yellow stemborer (Tryporyza incertulas) as revealed by an insect bioassay. The content of Cry1C* protein varied considerably among the five lines as well as among the corresponding hybrids. T1c-19, a line showing the highest content of Cry1C*protein, and its hybrid were tested in the field for insect resistance and agronomic performance and found to be highly resistant to stemborers and leaffolders throughout the growth period, resulting in a significantly increased grain yield compared with the respective controls. These results indicate that T1c-19 can be used for production of insect-resistant hybrid rice and as a germplasm for gene stacking to produce rice plants with two toxins. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.",

Four highly insect-resistant lines with single-copy insertion (designated as 2A-1, 2A-2,\n 2A-3, and 2A-4) were selected based on field assessment and Southern blot analysis in the T1 generation. All four transgenic lines showed Mendelian segregation by seed germination on 1/2 MS medium containing Basta.\n Homozygous transgenic plants were selected according to germination ratio (100%) in the T2 generation. Cry2A* protein concentrations were determined in homozygous transgenic lines, their derived hybrids, and their\n backcross offspring. The Cry2A* protein concentrations of four homozygous transgenic lines ranged from 9.65 to 12.11 μg/g\n of leaf fresh weight. There was little variation in the hybrids and backcross offspring. Insect bioassays were conducted in\n both the laboratory and field. All four transgenic lines were significantly resistant to lepidopteran rice pests.

        "abstract": " Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile rice has a number of desirable characteristics for hybrid rice production. Previous studies identified pms1, located on chromosome 7, as a major locus for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility. The objective of this study was to localize the pms1 locus to a specific DNA fragment by genetic and physical mapping. Using 240 highly sterile individuals and a random sample of 599 individuals from an F2 population of over 5000 individuals from a cross between Minghui 63 and 32001S, we localized the pms1 locus by molecular marker analysis to a genetic interval of about 4 cM, 0.25 cM from RG477 on one side and 3.8 cM from R1807 on the other side. A contig map composed of seven BAC clones spanning approximate 500 kb in length was constructed for the pms1 region by screening a BAC library of Minghui 63 DNA using RFLP markers and chromosomal walking. Analysis of recombination events in the pms1 region among the highly sterile individuals reduced the length of the contig map to three BAC clones. Sequencing of one BAC clone, 21O9, identified two SSR markers located 85 kb apart in the clone that flanked the pms1 locus on both sides, as indicated by the distribution of recombination events. We thus concluded that the pms1 locus was located on the fragment bounded by the two SSR markers.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and fungal blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea result in heavy production losses in rice, a main staple food for approximately 50% of the world's population. Application of host resistance to these pathogens is the most economical and environment-friendly approach to solve this problem. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling quantitative resistance are valuable sources for broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance. Although large numbers of QTLs for bacterial blight and blast resistance have been identified, these sources have not been used effectively in rice improvement because of the complex genetic control of quantitative resistance and because the genes underlying resistance QTLs are unknown. To isolate disease resistance QTLs, we established a candidate gene strategy that integrates linkage map, expression profile, and functional complementation analyses. This strategy has proven to be applicable for identifying the genes underlying minor resistance QTLs in rice-Xoo and rice-M. grisea systems and it may also help to shed light on disease resistance QTLs of other cereals. Our results also suggest that a single minor QTL can be used in rice improvement by modulating the expression of the gene underlying the QTL. Pyramiding two or three minor QTL genes, whose expression can be managed and that function in different defense signal transduction pathways, may allow the breeding of rice cultivars that are highly resistant to bacterial blight and blast.",

        "abstract": "Analyses of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for expression levels (eQTLs) of genes reveal a genetic relationship between expression variation and the regulator, thus unlocking information for identifying the regulatory network. Oligo-nucleotide expression microarrays hybridized with RNA can simultaneously provide data for molecular markers and transcript abundance. In this study, we used an Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array to analyze eQTLs in rice shoots at 72 h after germination from 110 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63. In total, 1632 single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) plus 23 PCR markers were identified and placed into 601 recombinant bins, spanning 1459 cM in length, which were used as markers to genotype the RILs. We obtained 16,372 expression traits (e-traits) each with at least one eQTL, resulting in 26,051 eQTLs in total, including both cis- and trans-eQTLs. We also identified 171 eQTL hot spots in the rice genome, each of which controls transcript variations of many e-traits. Gene ontology analysis revealed an enrichment of certain functional categories of genes in some of the eQTL hot spots. In particular, eQTLs for e-traits involving the DNA metabolic process was significantly enriched in several eQTL hot spots on chromosomes 3, 5 and 10. Several e-traits co-localizing with cis-eQTLs showed significant correlations with hundreds of e-traits, indicating possible co-regulation. We also detected correlations between QTLs for shoot dry weight and eQTLs, revealing possible candidate genes for the trait. These results provided clues for the identification and characterization of the regulatory network in the whole genome at the transcriptional level.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the most harmful bacterial disease of rice worldwide. Previously, we characterized major disease resistance (MR) gene xa25, which confers race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339. The xa25 is a recessive allele of the SWEET13 locus, but SWEET13's interaction with PXO339 and how efficiently using this locus for rice breeding still need to be defined. Here we show that the SWEET13 allele from rice Zhenshan 97 is a susceptibility gene to PXO339. Using this allele's promoter to regulate xa25 resulted in disease, suggesting that the promoter is a key determinant in SWEET13 caused disease in Zhanshan 97 after PXO339 infection. PXO339 transcriptionally induces SWEET13 to cause disease. Partial suppressing SWEET13 expression leads to a high level of resistance to PXO339. Thus, the transcriptionally suppressed SWEET13 functions as xa25 in resistance to PXO339. Hybrid rice is widely grown in many countries. However, recessive MR genes have not been efficiently used for disease resistance breeding in hybrid rice production for both parents of the hybrid have to carry the same recessive gene. However, the suppressed SWEET13 functions dominantly, which will have advantage to improve the resistance of hybrid rice to xa25-incomptible Xoo.",

        "abstract": "Adverse environmental conditions such as high temperature and drought stress greatly limit the growth and production of crops worldwide. Several NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) proteins have been documented as important regulators in stress responses, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, a stress-responsive NAC gene, SNAC3 (ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), conferring drought and heat tolerance in rice is reported. SNAC3 was ubiquitously expressed and its transcript level was induced by drought, high temperature, salinity stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Overexpression (OE) of SNAC3 in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of SNAC3 by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses. The SNAC3-OE transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), and relative electrolyte leakage than the wild-type control under heat stress conditions, implying that SNAC3 may confer stress tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the expression of a large number of ROS-scavenging genes was dramatically increased in the SNAC3-OE plants, but significantly decreased in the SNAC3-RNAi transgenic plants. Five ROS-associated genes which were up-regulated in SNAC3-OE plants showed co-expression patterns with SNAC3, and three of the co-expressed ROS-associated enzyme genes were verified to be direct target genes of SNAC3. These results suggest that SNAC3 plays important roles in stress responses, and it is likely to be useful for engineering crops with improved tolerance to heat and drought stress.",

However, little is known about the factors that directly regulate the function of WRKY genes. In this study, we identified cis-acting elements and their binding proteins of rice OsWRKY13, a gene that plays a pivotal role in disease resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Two novel pathogen-responsive cis-elements, PRE2 and PRE4, were characterized from the promoter region of OsWRKY13. The two cis-elements negatively regulate gene expression without pathogen challenge, and positively regulate gene expression after pathogen-induced protein binding. OsWRKY13 binds to PRE4, which harbours a novel W-like box. Another five proteins (Rad51-like; tubby-like; SWIM zinc finger and nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain R proteins and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domain containing proteins; and an unknown protein) also bind to one of the two cis-elements. Different proteins interacting with the same cis-element appear to have different DNA-binding core sequences. These proteins localize in the nucleus and show differential expression upon pathogen challenge. These results suggest that OsWRKY13 expression is regulated by multiple factors to achieve disease resistance.",

        "abstract": "Breeding crops with the quality of broad-spectrum disease resistance using genetic resources is one of the principal goals of crop improvement. However, the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance remains largely unknown. Here, we show that GH3-2, encoding an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, mediates a broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola and fungal Magnaporthe grisea in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA, the major form of auxin in rice, results in rice more vulnerable to the invasion of different types of pathogens, which is at least partly due to IAA-induced loosening of the cell wall, the natural protective barrier of plant cells to invaders. X. oryzae pv oryzae, X. oryzae pv oryzicola, and M. grisea secrete IAA, which, in turn, may induce rice to synthesize its own IAA at the infection site. IAA induces the production of expansins, the cell wall-loosening proteins, and makes rice vulnerable to pathogens. GH3-2 is likely contributing to a minor quantitative trait locus for broad-spectrum resistance. Activation of GH3-2 inactivates IAA by catalyzing the formation of an IAA-amino acid conjugate, which results in the suppression of expansin genes. Thus, GH3-2 mediates basal resistance by suppressing pathogen-induced IAA accumulation. It is expected that, regulated by a pathogen-induced strong promoter, GH3-2 alone may be used for breeding rice with a broad-spectrum disease resistance.",

Thirty-one CDPK genes have been identified in the rice genome by a complete search of the genome based upon HMM profiles. In this study,\n the expression of this gene family was analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array in three rice cultivars: Minghui 63,\n Zhenshan 97, and their hybrid Shanyou 63 independently. Twenty-seven tissues sampled throughout the entire rice life-span\n were studied, along with three hormone treatments (GA3, NAA and KT), applied to the seedling at the trefoil stage. All 31\n genes were found to be expressed in at least one of the experimental stages studied and revealed diverse expression patterns.\n We identified differential expression of the OsCPK genes in the stamen (1 day before flowering), the panicle (at the heading stage), the endosperm (days after pollination)\n and also in callus, in all three cultivars. Eight genes, OsCPK2, OsCPK11, OsCPK14, OsCPK22, OsCPK25, OsCPK26, OsCPK27 and OsCPK29 were found dominantly expressed in the panicle and the stamen, and five genes, OsCPK6, OsCPK7, OsCPK12, OsCPK23 and OsCPK31 were up-regulated in the endosperm stage. The OsCPK genes were also found to be regulated in rice seedlings subjected to different hormone treatment conditions, however their\n expression were not the same for all varieties.

        "abstract": "The genetic transformation efficiency of a rice variety is largely determined by its tissue culturability. Establishment of a highly efficient tissue-culture system has greatly accelerated the wide spread application of transgenic japonica varieties. However, such process for indica rice was hampered because this type of variety is recalcitrant to in vitro culture. This study aimed to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mature seed culturability using a chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSL) population derived from a cross between an indica variety \"Zhenshan 97B\" and a japonica variety \"Nipponbare\". The CSSLs consist of 139 lines each containing a single or a few introgression segments, and together covering the whole \"Nipponbare\" genome. Every CSSL was tested by culturing on the two medium systems developed for the respective indica and japonica parental varieties. The performance of culturability was evaluated by four indices: frequency of callus induction (CIF), callus subculture capability (CSC), frequency of plant regeneration (PRF) and the mean plantlet number per regenerated callus (MNR). All four traits displayed continuous variation among the CSSLs. With the culture system for japonica rice, three CIF QTLs, three CSC QTLs, three PRF QTLs and three MNR QTLs were detected. With the culture system for indica variety, six CIF QTLs, two CSC QTLs, three PRF QTLs and six MNR QTLs were identified, and these QTLs distributed on nine rice chromosomes. Two QTLs of CIF and two QTLs of MNR were detected in both the japonica and indica rice culture system. The correlation coefficients of all the four traits varied depending on the culture systems. These results provide the possibilities of enhancing the culturability of indica rice by marker-assisted breeding with those desirable alleles from the japonica.",

They occurred more frequently in categories of carbohydrate, energy and lipid metabolisms and stress response than expected, while less frequently in categories of amino acid metabolism, transcription and translation regulation, and signal transduction. A total of 214 sequences exhibited significant (P < 0.05) mid-parent heterosis in expression, of which 117 had homology to genes with known functions, assigned in the categories of basic metabolism, genetic information processing, cell growth and death, signal transduction, transportation and stress response.

        "abstract": "Abiotic stresses such as drought cause a reduction of plant growth and loss of crop yield. Stomatal aperture controls CO(2) uptake and water loss to the atmosphere, thus playing important roles in both the yield gain and drought tolerance of crops. Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response. SNAC1 could bind to the promoter of OsSRO1c and activate the expression of OsSRO1c. OsSRO1c was induced in guard cells by drought stress. The loss-of-function mutant of OsSRO1c showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild-type plant, whereas OsSRO1c overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss. Interestingly, OsSRO1c-overexpressing rice showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Expression of DST, a reported zinc finger gene negatively regulating H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure, and the activity of H(2)O(2)-scavenging related enzymes were significantly suppressed, and H(2)O(2) in guard cells was accumulated in the overexpression lines. OsSRO1c interacted with various stress-related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the OsSRO1c-interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance. The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST.",

        "abstract": "The function of bacterial-blight resistance gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice is influenced by genetic background; the Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica background can increase Xa3/Xa26 expression, resulting in an enhanced resistance. To identify whether Xa3/Xa26 transcript level is the only factor contributing to genetic background-controlled resistance, we screened an F(2) population that was developed from a cross between Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and japonica rice lines and was segregating for Xa3/Xa26, and compared the expression profiles of a pair of indica and japonica rice lines that both carried Xa3/Xa26. Eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs), in addition to Xa3/Xa26, were identified as contributing to the bacterial resistance of this population. Four of the eight QTLs were contributed to the japonica line. The resistance of this population was also affected by epistatic effects. Some F(2) individuals showed significantly increased Xa3/Xa26 transcripts, but the increased transcripts did not completely correlate with the reduced disease in this population. The analysis of the expression profile of Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance using a microarray containing approximate 7,990 rice genes identified 44 differentially expressed genes. Thirty-five genes were rapidly activated in the japonica background, but not in the indica background, during disease resistance. These results suggest that multiple factors, including the one resulting in increased Xa3/Xa26 expression, may contribute to the enhanced resistance in the japonica background. These factors can cause a variation in gene expression profile that differs from that in the indica background during disease resistance.",

        "title": "OsEDR1 negatively regulates rice bacterial resistance via activation of ethylene biosynthesis.",
        "abstract": "Rice OsEDR1 is a sequence ortholog of Arabidopsis EDR1. However, its molecular function is unknown. We show here that OsEDR1-suppressing/knockout (KO) plants, which developed spontaneous lesions on the leaves, have enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causing bacterial blight disease. This resistance was associated with increased accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), induced expression of SA- and JA-related genes and suppressed accumulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the direct precursor of ethylene, and expression of ethylene-related genes. OsEDR1-KO plants also showed suppressed production of ethylene. Knockout of OsEDR1 suppressed the ACC synthase (ACS) gene family, which encodes the rate-limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of ACC. The lesion phenotype and enhanced bacterial resistance of the OsEDR1-KO plants was partly complemented by the treatment with ACC. ACC treatment was associated with decreased SA and JA biosynthesis in OsEDR1-KO plants. In contrast, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, promoted expression of SA and JA synthesis-related genes in OsEDR1-KO plants. These results suggest that ethylene is a negative signalling molecule in rice bacterial resistance. In the rice-Xoo interaction, OsEDR1 transcriptionally promotes the synthesis of ethylene that, in turn, suppresses SA- and JA-associated defence signalling.",

Firstly, image SURF key points were obtained and descriptor vectors were collected at the detected key points. Secondly, the detected key points were collected by computing the Euclidean distance of their descriptor vectors. Next, the matched SURF key points were used to estimate the affine transform parameters. After discounting the estimated transforms, all pixels within the copy-move regions were obtained. Finally, the copied region and the tampered region were distinguished from the copy-move regions according to the BACMFs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective for the detection and location of copy-move forgery in JPEG images.",

        "abstract": "Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) has been implicated in several important physiological and developmental processes, but its role in the regulation of plant stress responses remains elusive. Here, we report that H2Bub1 is crucially involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and drought response in rice. We found the rice HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION2 (OsHUB2), an E3 ligase for H2Bub1, interacted with OsbZIP46, a key transcription factor regulating ABA signaling and drought response in rice. Genetic analyses suggest that OsHUB2, up-regulated by drought and ABA, positively modulates ABA sensitivity and drought resistance. The H2Bub1 levels were increased in the OsbZIP46 target genes under the drought stress and ABA treatments, and the increased H2Bub1 levels were positively correlated to the increased expression levels of the target genes. Interestingly, MODD, a reported suppressor of ABA signaling and drought resistance through mediation of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation, can repress the H2Bub1 level in the OsbZIP46 target genes by recruiting a putative deubiquitinase OsOTLD1. Suppression of OsOTLD1 in vivo resulted in increased H2Bub1 levels and expression of OsbZIP46 target genes. These findings established an elaborate mechanism of histone monoubiquitination in the fine-turning of ABA signaling and drought response via balancing H2Bub1 deposition and removal.",

Vibrationally excited glycolaldehyde is unambiguously identified in source B for the first time, constituting the first detection in interstellar space. Rotational transitions of gGg$^{prime}$(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ are also firstly detected in source A. Multiple transitions spanning a wide energy range allow us to derive accurate physical parameters. Vibrationally excited glycolaldehyde transitions have a higher gas temperature and abundance than their rotational transitions. A larger number of spectral lines is found towards source B, which also has higher temperatures but lower abundances compared to source A. The results indicate different physical and chemical conditions for the two twin sources.",

        "abstract": "Summary Previous studies determined that photoperiod sensitive genic male sterility (PSGMS) in rice was controlled in most of the crosses by two classical duplicated loci, pms1 and pms3, located on chromosomes 7 and 12, respectively, and pms3 is the locus where the original PSGMS mutation occurred. The objective of this study was to fine map the pms3 locus by constructing populations segregating only at the pms3 locus. A population of doubled haploid (DH) lines were developed from the F 1 of a cross between Nongken 58S and 1514; two DH lines containing the sterile allele at the pms1 locus and fertile allele at the pms3 locus were identified by molecular marker assay. These two DH lines were crossed with Nongken 58S, from which two F 2 populations were obtained. Field examination showed that fertility segregation in both populations was controlled by the pms3 locus. Screening of a bacterial artificial chromosome library with a probe (C185), that was located in the pms3 genomic region and did not detect polymorphism between the parents of the mapping population, obtained a positive clone; a subclone from this clone detected polymorphism between the parents. Analysis of highly sterile individuals from one of the F 2 populations using molecular markers in this region resolved the pms3 locus to an interval between two molecular markers flanking the gene at 1.6 cM on each side. This close linkage is useful for marker assisted transfer of this gene in breeding programs and for map-based cloning.

        "abstract": "The pathogen-induced plant defense signaling network consists of multiple components, although only some of them are characterized. Most of the known components function either as activators or repressors in host-pathogen interactions. Here we report that a mitogen-activated protein kinase, OsMPK6, functions both as an activator and a repressor in rice resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal organism of bacterial blight disease. Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes. Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance. The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal organism of bacterial streak disease, in systemic tissues. Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants. These results suggest that OsMPK6 negatively regulates SAR. Thus OsMPK6 is a two-faced player in the rice-Xoo interaction.",

Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) consists of two subspecies, indica and japonica; inter-subspecific hybrids are usually sterile. We show that a killer-protector system at the S5 locus encoded by three tightly linked genes [Open Reading Frame 3 (ORF3) to ORF5] regulates fertility in indica-japonica hybrids. During female sporogenesis, the action of ORF5+ (killer) and ORF4+ (partner) causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ORF3+ (protector) prevents ER stress and produces normal gametes, but ORF3- cannot prevent ER stress, resulting in premature programmed cell death and leads to embryo-sac abortion. Preferential transmission of ORF3+ gametes results in segregation distortion in the progeny. These results add to our understanding of differences between indica and japonica rice and may aid in rice genetic improvement.",

In this research, we analyzed\n transcriptional profiles of rice GOGAT genes using a genome-wide microarray database, and investigated the effects of suppression\n of glutamate synthase genes on carbon and nitrogen metabolism using GOGAT co-suppressed rice plants. Transcriptional profiles showed that rice GOGAT genes were expressed differently in various tissues\n and organs, which suggested that they have different roles in vivo. Compared with the wild-type, tiller number, total shoot dry weight, and yield of GOGAT co-suppressed plants were significantly decreased. Physiological and biochemical studies showed that the contents of nitrate,\n several kinds of free amino acids, chlorophyll, sugars, sugar phosphates, and pyridine nucleotides were significantly decreased\n in leaves of GOGAT co-suppressed plants, but the contents of free ammonium, 2-oxoglutarate, and isocitrate in leaves were increased. We conclude\n that GOGATs play essential roles in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and that they are indispensable for efficient nitrogen\n assimilation in rice.",

        "abstract": "Enhancer trapping has provided a powerful strategy for identifying novel genes and regulatory elements. In this study, we adopted an enhancer trap system, consisting of the GAL4/VP16-UAS elements with GUS as the reporter, to generate a trapping population of rice. Currently, 31 443 independent transformants were obtained from two cultivars using Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA insertion. PCR tests and DNA blot hybridization showed that about 94% of the transformants contained T-DNA insertions. The transformants carried, on average, two copies of the T-DNA, and 42% of the transformants had single-copy insertions. Histochemical assays of approximately 1000 T0 plants revealed various patterns of the reporter gene expression, including expression in only one tissue, and simultaneously in two or more tissues. The expression pattern of the reporter gene in T1 families corresponded well with the T0 plants and segregated in a 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio in majority of the T1 families tested. The frequency of reporter gene expression in the enhancer trap lines was much higher than that in gene trap lines reported previously. Analysis of flanking sequences of T-DNA insertion sites from about 200 transformants showed that almost all the sequences had homology with the sequences in the rice genome databases. Morphologically conspicuous mutations were observed in about 7.5% of the 2679 T1 families that were field-tested, and segregation in more than one-third of the families fit the 3 : 1 ratio. It was concluded that GAL4/VP16-UAS elements provided a useful system for enhancer trap in rice.",

        "abstract": "Cold stress is one of the major limiting factors for rice ( Oryza sativa ) productivity. Several MYB transcriptional factors have been reported as important regulators in the cold stress response, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene,  OsMYB30 , for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice. Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of  OsMYB30  in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the  osmyb30  knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that a few β-amylase ( BMY ) genes were down-regulated by OsMYB30. The  BMY  activity and maltose content, which were decreased and increased in the  OsMYB30  overexpression and  osmyb30  knockout mutant, respectively, were correlated with the expression patterns of the  BMY  genes. OsMYB30 was shown to bind to the promoters of the  BMY  genes. These results suggested that OsMYB30 exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the  BMY  genes. In addition, application of maltose had a protective effect for cell membranes under cold stress conditions. Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein, OsJAZ9, that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of  BMY  genes mediated by OsMYB30. These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the  BMY  genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine-tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose, which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.",

        "abstract": "Systematic characterization of genetic and molecular mechanisms in the formation of hybrid sterility is of fundamental importance in understanding reproductive isolation and speciation. Using ultra-high-density genetic maps, 43 single-locus quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 223 digenic interactions for embryo-sac, pollen, and spikelet fertility are depicted from three crosses between representative varieties of japonica and two varietal groups of indica, which provide an extensive archive for investigating the genetic basis of reproductive isolation in rice. Ten newly detected single-locus QTLs for inter- and intra-subspecific fertility are identified. Three loci for embryo-sac fertility are detected in both Nip × ZS97 and Nip × MH63 crosses, whereas QTLs for pollen fertility are not in common between the two crosses thus leading to fertility variation. Five loci responsible for fertility and segregation distortion are observed in the ZS97 × MH63 cross. The importance of two-locus interactions on fertility are quantified in the whole genome, which identify that three types of interaction contribute to fertility reduction in the hybrid. These results construct the genetic architecture with respect to various forms of reproductive barriers in rice, which have significant implications in utilization of inter-subspecific heterosis along with improvement in the fertility of indica-indica hybrids at single- and multi-locus level.",

However, it has been unclear how TALEs, after they have been injected into the host cells, activate transcription of host genes required for infection success. Here, we show that the basal transcription factor IIA gamma subunit TFIIAγ5 from rice is a key component for infection by the TALE-carrying bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent for bacterial blight. Direct interaction of several TALEs with TFIIAγ5 is required for activation of disease susceptibility genes. Conversely, reduced expression of the TFIIAγ5 host gene limits the induction of susceptibility genes and thus decreases bacterial blight symptoms. Suppression or mutation of TFIIAγ5 can also reduce bacterial streak, another devastating disease of rice caused by TALE-carrying X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. These results have important implications for formulating a widely applicable strategy with which to improve resistance of plants to TALE-carrying pathogens. ",

        "abstract": "Rice seed storage protein (SSP) is an important source of nutrition and energy. Understanding the genetic basis of SSP content and mining favorable alleles that control it will be helpful for breeding new improved cultivars. An association analysis for SSP content was performed to identify underlying genes using 527 diverse  accessions grown in two environments. We identified more than 107 associations for five different traits, including the contents of albumin (Alb), globulin (Glo), prolamin (Pro), glutelin (Glu), and total SSP (Total). A total of 28 associations were located at previously reported QTLs or intervals. A lead SNP sf0709447538, associated for Glu content in the  subpopulation in 2015, was further validated in near isogenic lines NIL(Zhenshan97) and NIL(Delong208), and the Glu phenotype had significantly difference between two NILs. The association region could be target for map-based cloning of the candidate genes. There were 13 associations in regions close to grain-quality-related genes; five lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located less than 20 kb upstream from grain-quality-related genes (, , , , and, ). Several starch-metabolism-related genes (, , , , and ) were also associated with SSP content. We identified favorable alleles of functional candidate genes, such as , , , and other four candidate genes by haplotype analysis and expression pattern. Genotypes of  and  with higher Pro were not identified in  and exhibited much higher expression levels in  group. The lead SNP sf0601764762, repeatedly detected for Alb content in 2 years in the whole association population, was located in the  locus that controls the synthesis of amylose. And Alb content was significantly and negatively correlated with amylose content and the level of 2.3 kb  pre-mRNA examined in this study. The associations or candidate genes identified would provide new insights into the genetic basis of SSP content that will help in developing rice cultivars with improved grain nutritional quality through marker-assisted breeding.",

Although a few quantitative trait loci associated with stigma exsertion have been fine mapped or cloned, the underlying genetic architecture remains unclear. We performed a genome-wide association study on stigma exsertion and related floral traits using 6.5 million SNPs characterized in 533 diverse accessions of Oryza sativa. We identified 23 genomic loci that are significantly associated with stigma exsertion and related traits, three of which are co-localized with three major grain size genes GS3, GW5, and GW2. Further analyses indicated that these three genes affected the stigma exsertion by controlling the size and shape of the spikelet and stigma. Combinations of GS3 and GW5 largely defined the levels of stigma exsertion and related traits. Selections of these two genes resulted in specific distributions of floral traits among subpopulations of O. sativa. The low stigma exsertion combination gw5GS3 existed in half of the cultivated rice varieties; therefore, introducing the GW5gs3 combination into male sterile lines is of high potential for improving the seed production of hybrid rice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The infection rate of a propagation model is an important factor for characterizing a dynamic diffusion process accurately, which determines the scale and speed of a diffusion. Inferring an infection rate, based on an observed propagation phenomenon, can help us better estimate the threat of a diffusion in advance and deploy corresponding strategies to restrain such diffusion. Meanwhile, the infection rate is a vital and predefined parameter in the field of propagation network reconstruction and propagation source identification. Therefore, how to infer an infection rate effectively from observed diffusion data is of great significance. In this paper, a backpropagation-based maximum likelihood estimation (BP-ML) is used to infer such infection rate. More specifically, a set of sensors are first deployed into a network for collecting diffusion data (i.e., the infection time of a node). Then, a series of backpropagations are initiated by nodes resided by these sensors in order to deduce the more probable infection rate based on the maximum likelihood estimation. Some experiments in real-world networks show that by taking full advantage of observed diffusion data, our proposed method can infer the infection rate of a diffusion accurately.",

First, according to the transportation information (i.e., bus route data and metro route data) in Chongqing, three static network models, i.e., a bus network, a metro network, and a bus-metro transit network, are proposed based on the spaces  L  and  P . More specifically, as a multiplex network, the bus-metro transit network is modeled for depicting the coupled structure between the bus network and the metro network. By analyzing the attack tolerance of transportation networks under the condition of different attack patterns, we find that the inter-layer coupling between the bus network and the metro network can improve the robustness of an urban transportation system. Furthermore, the community structure of mobility patterns of residents is revealed based on passenger information (i.e., smart-card data) of the metro system, which is caused by the regionalization of residential areas in a mountain city. Experimental studies above can provide guidance for the design and optimization of a PTS.",

A number of dominant major disease resistance () genes and recessive  genes against  have been cloned and molecularly characterized in the last two decades. However, how these  genes mediated-resistances occur at the cytological level is largely unknown. Here, by ultrastructural examination of xylem parenchyma cells, we show that resistances to  conferred by dominant  genes and recessive  genes resulted in different types of programmed cell death (PCD). Three dominant  genes , and  and two recessive  genes  and  that encode very different proteins were used in this study. We observed that -, -, and -mediated resistances to  were associated mainly with autophagy-like cell death featured by the formation of autophagosome-like bodies in the xylem parenchyma cells. In contrast, the - and -mediated resistances to  were associated mainly with vacuolar-mediated cell death characterized by tonoplast disruption of the xylem parenchyma cells. Application of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine partially compromised -, -, and -mediated resistances, as did NaHPO alkaline solution to - and -mediated resistances. These results suggest that autophagy-like cell death is a feature of the dominant  gene-mediated resistance to  and vacuolar-mediated cell death is a characteristic of the recessive  gene-mediated resistance.",

        "abstract": "The function of OsDR8, a rice disease resistance-responsive gene, was studied. Silencing of OsDR8 using an RNA interference approach resulted in phenotypic alteration of the plants. The transgenic plants with repressed\n expression of OsDR8 showed reduced resistance or susceptibility to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Magnaporthe grisea causing bacterial blight and blast, which are two of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide, respectively. The putative\n product of OsDR8 was highly homologous to an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the thiazole precursor of thiamine. Transgenic plants\n showing repressed expression of OsDR8 and reduced resistance had significantly lower levels of thiamine than the control plants. Exogenous application of thiamine\n could complement the compromised defense of the OsDR8-silenced plants. The expression level of several defense-responsive genes including the earlier functional genes of defense\n transduction pathway, OsPOX and OsPAL, and the downstream genes of the pathway, OsPR1a, OsPR1b, OsPR4, OsPR5 and OsPR10, was also decreased in the OsDR8-silenced plants. These results suggest that the impact of OsDR8 on disease resistance in rice may be through the regulation of expression of other defense-responsive genes and the site\n of OsDR8 function is on the upstream of the signal transduction pathway. In addition, the accumulation of thiamine may be\n essential for bacterial blight resistance and blast resistance.",

Currently, lots of strategies are proposed based on topological structures of networks, such as degree-based and betweenness-based network immunization strategies. However, these studies assume that nodes in a network are homogeneous, i.e., each node has the same characteristic. However, more and more studies have revealed the heterogeneous characteristic of a network. For example, the activities of individual in a computer and social network play an important role in virus spreading and rumor propagation. Some active individuals can promote the outbreak of virus and the spread of a rumor. In this paper, a new network immunization strategy is proposed through combining the characteristics of network structure with node activities. Comprehensive experiments in both benchmark and synthetic networks show that our proposed strategy can restrain virus prorogation effectively.",

        "abstract": "How defense genes originated with the evolution of their specific pathogen-responsive traits remains an important problem. It is generally known that a form of duplication can generate new genes, suggesting that a new gene usually evolves from an ancestral gene. However, we show that a new defense gene in plants may evolve by de novo origination, resulting in sophisticated disease-resistant functions in rice. Analyses of gene evolution showed that this new gene, OsDR10, had homologs only in the closest relative, Leersia genus, but not other subfamilies of the grass family; therefore, it is a rice tribe-specific gene that may have originated de novo in the tribe. We further show that this gene may evolve a highly conservative rice-specific function that contributes to the regulation difference between rice and other plant species in response to pathogen infections. Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10-suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease. This enhanced disease resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA) and suppressed accumulation of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) as well as modified expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. These data and analyses provide fresh insights into the new biologic and evolutionary processes of a de novo gene recruited rapidly.",

        "abstract": "New evidence suggests a role for the plant growth hormone auxin in pathogenesis and disease resistance. Bacterial infection induces the accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major type of auxin, in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA induces the expression of expansins, proteins that loosen the cell wall. Loosening the cell wall is key for plant growth but may also make the plant vulnerable to biotic intruders. Here, we report that rice GH3-8, an auxin-responsive gene functioning in auxin-dependent development, activates disease resistance in a salicylic acid signaling- and jasmonic acid signaling-independent pathway. GH3-8 encodes an IAA-amino synthetase that prevents free IAA accumulation. Overexpression of GH3-8 results in enhanced disease resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. This resistance is independent of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling. Overexpression of GH3-8 also causes abnormal plant morphology and retarded growth and development. Both enhanced resistance and abnormal development may be caused by inhibition of the expression of expansins via suppressed auxin signaling.",

        "abstract": "Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms often have a lower search efficiency for solving travelling salesman problems (TSPs). According to this shortcoming, this paper proposes a universal self-adaptive control strategy of population size for ACO algorithms. By decreasing the number of ants dynamically based on the optimal solutions obtained from each interaction, the computational efficiency of ACO algorithms can be improved dramatically. Moreover, the proposed strategy can be easily combined with various ACO algorithms because it’s independent of operation details. Two well-known ACO algorithms, i.e., ant colony system (ACS) and max-min ant system (MMAS), are used to estimate the performance of our proposed strategy. Some experiments in both synthetic and benchmark datasets show that the proposed strategy reduces the computational cost under the condition of finding the same approximate solutions.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify rice gene promoters that are specifically induced by feeding of the striped stemborer\n (Chilo suppressalis). Two PCR-selected cDNA subtractive libraries were constructed from the rice variety Minghui 63. Up- and down-regulated cDNAs\n induced by C. suppressalis feeding were arrayed on nylon membranes. After array hybridization and Northern blot analysis, a cDNA (B1-A04) encoding a\n putative subtilisin/chymotrypsin inhibitor was found to be rapidly and highly induced by C. suppressalis feeding, compared with mechanical wounding. The putative promoter region, spanning from −1,569 to +446 relative to the transcriptional\n initiation site was isolated, fused to the GUS gene (β-glucuronidase reporter gene) and introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to rice. In non-infested plants,\n the GUS activity driven by this promoter fragment was detected in culms and panicles, but not in leaves and sheaths. At 6 h\n after insect feeding, GUS activity was significantly induced in sheaths and culms, but not in leaves. GUS activity and native\n B1-A04 gene were not induced by JA and ABA treatment. A serial deletion analysis revealed two regions (−1,569 to −1,166 and\n −1,166 to −582) that negatively regulate the gene expression in sheaths of non-infested plants but not in insect-infested\n plants. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) identified 7 DNA fragments with various binding activities with nuclear\n proteins from mechanically wounded, insect-infested and untreated plants, and their possible roles in gene regulation were\n speculated. This promoter fragment should have utility in development of insect resistant transgenic crops.",

Community detection is one of the important applications of the evolutionary algorithm. Detecting the community structure, an essential property for complex networks, can help us understand the inherent functions of real systems. It has been proved that genetic algorithm (GA) is feasible for community detection, and yet existing GA-based community detection algorithms still need improving in terms of their robustness and accuracy. A Physarum-based network model (PNM) with an intelligence of recognizing inter-community edges based on a kind of multi-headed slime mold, has been proposed in the phase of GA's initialization for optimization. In this paper, integrated with PNM after three operators of GA during the process of community detection, a novel genetic algorithm, called P-GACD, is proposed to improve the efficiency of GA for community detection. In addition, some experiments are implemented in five real-world networks to evaluate the performance of P-GACD. The results reveal that P-GACD shows an advantage in terms of the robustness and accuracy, contrasted with the existing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Researchers have already found that the interaction data on Blogs bulletin board and social network are the reflection of human and human society. It can be used to build a user profile and tell the researchers what a network community is composed of. In previous studies we have noticed that users who are friends in real life tend to interact with each other with high frequency and the characteristics of their blogs shares more similarity, compared with that of strangers. It brings the idea that can we predict the behavior as well as personal value of a total new comer by the friends around him/her?\n\nIn this paper we proposed a method to classify the sub-community groups into even smaller and more alike ones by applying information gain ratio based decision tree to users' tags as well as behavior patterns. First we recognize the social network groups by community discover algorithm with Sina blog-oriented community definition and then further analyze the topology of the groups by frequency subtree mining to discover the real closely collected small groups. Then we collect the users' tags by text mining and assign every user a 10 words long tag set. Finally we use the information gain ratio decision tree to catalogue users into even smaller groups with greater similarity. Results show that our method has a higher accuracy.\n\n",

Here we show that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) Ghd7, isolated from an elite rice hybrid and encoding a CCT domain protein, has major effects on an array of traits in rice, including number of grains per panicle, plant height and heading date. Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long-day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size. Natural mutants with reduced function enable rice to be cultivated in temperate and cooler regions. Thus, Ghd7 has played crucial roles for increasing productivity and adaptability of rice globally.",

Many methods, ranging from the optimization-based algorithms to the heuristic-based algorithms, have been proposed for solving such a problem. Due to the inherent complexity of identifying network structure, how to design an effective algorithm with a higher accuracy and a lower computational cost still remains an open problem. Inspired by the computational capability and positive feedback mechanism in the wake of foraging process of Physarum, which is a large amoeba-like cell consisting of a dendritic network of tube-like pseudopodia, a general Physarum-based computational framework for community detection is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed framework, the inter-community edges can be identified from the intra-community edges in a network and the positive feedback of solving process in an algorithm can be further enhanced, which are used to improve the efficiency of original optimization-based and heuristic-based community detection algorithms, respectively. Some typical algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm, and Markov clustering algorithm) and real-world datasets have been used to estimate the efficiency of our proposed computational framework. Experiments show that the algorithms optimized by Physarum-inspired computational framework perform better than the original ones, in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Moreover, a computational complexity analysis verifies the scalability of our framework.",

In this study, we identified 29 C3HC4-type RING finger family genes in rice (Oryza sativa) by database search. Motif analysis revealed the presence of three conserved motifs with unknown functions within the predicted proteins. Promoter analysis found 196 cis-elements in the 2-kb upstream regions of these genes, including a stress-responsive element, a hormone-responsive element, and a light-responsive element. In addition, a comprehensive expression analysis of these genes has been performed using microarray data obtained from 27 tissues or organs of three rice genotypes, Minghui 63, Zhenshan 97, and Shanyou 63. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that five C3HC4-type RING finger genes are preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues or organs such as stamen, panicle, and endosperm. Expression analysis of C3HC4-type RING finger genes under abiotic stresses suggests that twelve genes are differentially regulated by hormones or stress in rice seedlings. These results would be useful for elucidating their roles in the growth, development, and stress response of the rice plant.",

        "abstract": "Community mining is a vital problem for complex network analysis. Markov chains based algorithms are known as its easy-to-implement and have provided promising solutions for community mining. Existing Markov clustering algorithms have been optimized from the aspects of parallelization and penalty strategy. However, the dynamic process for enlarging the inhomogeneity attracts little attention. As the key mechanism of Markov chains based algorithms, such process affects the qualities of divisions and computational cost directly. This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm based on Physarum, a kind of slime. The new algorithm enhances the dynamic process of Markov clustering algorithm by embedding the Physarum-inspired feedback system. Specifically, flows between vertexes can enhance the corresponding transition probability in Markov clustering algorithms, and vice versa. Some networks with known and unknown community structures are used to estimate the performance of our proposed algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm has higher NMI, Q values and lower computational cost than that of the typical algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Grasses produce tiller and panicle branching at vegetative and reproductive stages; the branching patterns largely define the diversity of grasses and constitute a major determinant for grain yield of many cereals. Here we show that a spatiotemporally coordinated gene network consisting of the MicroRNA 156 (miR156/)miR529/SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) and miR172/APETALA2 (AP2) pathways regulates tiller and panicle branching in rice. SPL genes negatively control tillering, but positively regulate inflorescence meristem and spikelet transition. Underproduction or overproduction of SPLs reduces panicle branching, but by distinct mechanisms: miR156 and miR529 fine-tune the SPL levels for optimal panicle size. miR172 regulates spikelet transition by targeting AP2-like genes, which does not affect tillering, and the AP2-like proteins play the roles by interacting with TOPLESS-related proteins (TPRs). SPLs modulate panicle branching by directly regulating the miR172/AP2 and PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2)/Rice TFL1/CEN homolog 1 (RCN1) pathways and also by integrating other regulators, most of which are not involved in tillering regulation. These findings may also have significant implications for understanding branching regulation of other grasses and for application in rice genetic improvement.",

        "abstract": "Phased small-interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are a special class of small RNAs, which are generated in 21- or 24-nt intervals from transcripts of precursor RNAs. Although phasiRNAs have been found in a range of organisms, their biological functions in plants have yet to be uncovered. Here we show that phasiRNAs generated by the photopheriod-sensetive genic male sterility 1 (Pms1) locus were associated with photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) in rice, a germplasm that started the two-line hybrid rice breeding. The Pms1 locus encodes a long-noncoding RNA PMS1T that was preferentially expressed in young panicles. PMS1T was targeted by miR2118 to produce 21-nt phasiRNAs that preferentially accumulated in the PSMS line under long-day conditions. A single nucleotide polymorphism in PMS1T nearby the miR2118 recognition site was critical for fertility change, likely leading to differential accumulation of the phasiRNAs. This result suggested possible roles of phasiRNAs in reproductive development of rice, demonstrating the potential importance of this RNA class as regulators in biological processes.",

        "abstract": "Wild and cultivated species of soybeans have coexisted for 5000 years in China. Despite this long history, there is very little information on the genetic relationship of Glycine soja and G. max. To gain insight into the major events in the history of the subgenus Soja, we examined 20 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of a large number of accessions (910). The results showed no significant differences between wild and semi-wild soybeans in genetic diversity but significant differences between G. soja and G. max. Ancestry and cluster analyses revealed that semi-wild soybeans should belong to the wild category and not to G. max. Our results also showed that differentiation had occurred not only among G. soja, G. gracilis, and G. max but also within G. soja and within G. gracilis. Glycine soja had 3 clear genetic categories: typical small-seeded (≤2.0 g 100-seed weight), dual-origin middle-seeded (2.0-2.5 g), and large-seeded plants (2.51-3.0 g). These last were genetically close to G. gracilis, their defining some traits having been acquired mainly by introgression from soybeans. Small-seeded G. gracilis (3.01-3.5 g) were genetically different from larger seeded ones (from 3.51 to 4.0 to over 10 g). Seed size predominated over seed coat color in evolutionary degree. Typical and large-seeded G. soja were found to have 0.7% and 12% introgressive cultivar genes, respectively. The genetic boundary of G. gracilis was at the range of 2.51-3.0 g of G. soja. In the great majority of wild accessions, traits such as white flowers, gray pubescences, no-seed bloom, and colored seed coats were likely introgressive from domesticated soybeans.",

        "abstract": "Plant GH3 genes are key components of the hormonal mechanism regulating growth and development, responding to biotic and abiotic stress. GH3 proteins are involved in hormonal homeostasis through conjugation to amino acids of the free form of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid (JA) or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Our previous work has uncovered that two GH3 genes encoding IAA-amido synthetase play important roles in the resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice, however, whether other rice GH3 genes play roles in resistance to Xoo is unclear. Here, we validated that GH3.3, GH3.5, GH3.6 and GH3.12, four members of group I GH3 family, are the functional JA-Ile synthetases by catalyzing the conversion of free JA into active form of JA-Ile in vitro and in vivo. The overexpressing plants of four genes individually accumulated less JA but more JA-Ile than the wild type plants. Conversely, the corresponding suppressing plants of four genes contained comparable JA and JA-Ile concentrations, but the triple and quadruple suppressing plants had lower level of JA-Ile compared with wild type plants, suggesting functional redundancy of the same clade of GH3 family. Furthermore, the group I GH3 family genes positively mediated rice resistance to bacterial pathogen Xoo through modulating JA homeostasis and regulating transcription pattern of JA-responsive genes.",

        "abstract": "Drought is a major limiting factor for crop production. To identify critical genes for drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant, DSM2. The mutant phenotype was caused by a T-DNA insertion in a gene encoding a putative β-carotene hydroxylase (BCH). BCH is predicted for the biosynthesis of zeaxanthin, a carotenoid precursor of abscisic acid (ABA). The amounts of zeaxanthin and ABA were significantly reduced in two allelic DSM2 mutants after drought stress compared with the wild type. Under drought stress conditions, the mutant leaves lost water faster than the wild type and the photosynthesis rate, biomass, and grain yield were significantly reduced, whereas malondialdehyde level and stomata aperture were increased in the mutant. The mutant is also hypersensitive to oxidative stresses. The mutant had significantly lower maximal efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry and nonphotochemical quenching capacity than the wild type, indicating photoinhibition in photosystem II and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation. Overexpression of DSM2 in rice resulted in significantly increased resistance to drought and oxidative stresses and increases of the xanthophylls and nonphotochemical quenching. Some stress-related ABAresponsive genes were up-regulated in the overexpression line. DSM2 is a chloroplast protein, and the response of DSM2 to environmental stimuli is distinctive from the other two BCH members in rice. We conclude that the DSM2 gene significantly contributes to control of the xanthophyll cycle and ABA synthesis, both of which play critical roles in the establishment of drought resistance in rice. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.",

        "title": "Absence of OsβCA1 causes CO2 deficit and affects leaf photosynthesis and stomatal response to CO2 in rice",
        "abstract": "SummaryPlants always adjust the opening of stomatal pores to adapt to the environments, such as [CO2], humidity and temperature. Low [CO2] will trigger the opening of stomatal pores to absorb extra CO2. However, little is known about how CO2 supply affects the carbon fixation and opening of stomatal pores in rice. Here, a chloroplast-located β-carbonic anhydrase (β-CA) coding gene was found to be involved in carbon assimilation and CO2-mediated stomatal pore response in rice. OsβCA1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its transcripts were induced by high [CO2] in leaves. Both T-DNA mutant and RNAi lines showed phenotypes of lower biomass and CA activities. The knock-out of OsβCA1 obviously decreased the photosynthesis capacity, as demonstrated by the increased CO2 compensation point and decreased light saturation point in the mutant; while the knock-out increased the opening ratio of stomatal pores and water loss rate. Moreover, the mutant showed a delayed response to low [CO2], and they could not be closed to the degree of wild plants even though the stomatal pores could rapidly respond to high [CO2]. Genome-wide gene expression analysis via RNA-seq demonstrated that the transcript abundance of the genes related to RuBisCO, photosystem compounds and opening of stomatal pores were globally up-regulated in the mutant. Taken together, the inadequate CO2 supply caused by the absence of OsβCA1 reduces photosynthesis efficiency, triggers the opening of stomatal pores and finally decreases their sensitivity to CO2 fluctuation.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Development of crop varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is imperative for sustainable agriculture. Understanding how plant genes respond to low N stress is essential for formulating approaches to manipulating genes for improving NUE. In this study we analyzed the expression profiles of an indica rice cultivar Minghui 63 at seedling stage at 20 min, 1 and 2 h after low N stress with the normal N as the control, using a microarray of 11,494 rice ESTs representing 10,422 unique genes. While no significant difference was detected in the leaf tissue, a total of 471 ESTs were detected as responsive to low N stress in the root tissue with 115 ESTs showing up-regulation and 358 ESTs showing down-regulation. The analysis of expression profiles after low N stress identified following patterns: (1) the genes involved in photosynthesis and energy metabolism were down-regulated rapidly; (2) many of the genes involved in early responses to biotic and abiotic stresses were up-regulated while many other stress responsive genes were down-regulated; (3) regulatory genes including transcription factors and ones involved in signal transduction were both up- and down-regulated; and (4) the genes known to be involved in N uptake and assimilation showed little response to the low N stress. The challenges for future studies are to characterize the functional roles of the low N stress responsive genes in N metabolisms, including the large number of genes presently with unknown functions.",

In this study, we analyzed low-coverage sequencing data of 1,479 rice accessions from 73 countries, including landraces and modern cultivars. We identified two major subpopulations, indica I (IndI) and indica II (IndII), in the indica subspecies, which corresponded to the two putative heterotic groups resulting from independent breeding efforts. We detected 200 regions spanning 7.8% of the rice genome that had been differentially selected between IndI and IndII, and thus referred to as breeding signatures. These regions included large numbers of known functional genes and loci associated with important agronomic traits revealed by genome-wide association studies. Grain yield was positively correlated with the number of breeding signatures in a variety, suggesting that the number of breeding signatures in a line may be useful for predicting agronomic potential and the selected loci may provide targets for rice improvement.",

        "abstract": "Delayed leaf-senescence, or stay-green, has been regarded as a desired characteristic for the production of a number of crops including rice. In this study, we analyzed the genetic basis of stay-green using a population of 190 doubled haploid lines from the cross between an indica parent Zhenshan 97 and a stay-green japonica parent Wuyujing 2. The population was tested in replicated field trials in 2 consecutive years, and six traits were defined to evaluate the stay-green characteristics. A genetic linkage map with 179 SSR (simple sequence repeat) marker loci was constructed. The software QTLMapper, based on a mixed linear model approach, was applied to detect QTLs, epistatic effects and their environmental interactions for these traits. A total of 46 main-effect QTLs was detected for the six traits that can be localized to 25 chromosomal regions. The individual effects of all the QTLs were small. Fifty digenic interactions were resolved that involved 66 loci distributed on all 12 chromosomes. Environmental interactions were detected for 18 of the main-effect QTLs and 14 of the epistatic interactions. Collectively, the epistatic effects and QTL by year interactions accounted for large proportions of the phenotypic variations. The results also showed that most of the stay-green traits were negatively correlated with yield and its component traits. The implications of the results in crop improvement were discussed.",

        "abstract": "We used pot cultivation with coastal soil containing total 3% salinity to identify the salt tolerance of 895 wild soybean plants collected in the Tianjin and Tangshan regions of China,and to determine Na+,Cl-,K+,Ca2+,Mg2+ contents in the stems and leaves of 203 plants that died at different stages and at maturity.The aim was to evaluate the differences of ion accumulations in the dead and survival wild soybean plants,and to discuss the mechanism of salt tolerance.The results showed that there were no significant differences in the content of every ion(Na+,Cl-,K+,Ca2+,Mg2+) among these plants with a different survival time during the vegetative growth period.When the content of Na+ or Cl-was accumulated to a certain high level in plants,the low salt-tolerant plants would be dead.Wild soybean individuals could die when their stems accumulated Na+ and Cl-to the range of 3.239-4.682% and 4.639-6.328%,and their leaves accumulated Na+ and Cl-to the range of 1.754-2.349% and 4.126-5.073%,respectively.The salt-tolerant plants could be divided into three types of low,moderate,and high levels in ion accumulations.The contents of Na+ and Cl-in the stems and leaves of the high salt-tolerant plants were less than those of the low salt-tolerant ones.With survival time prolonging,the contents of K+ in the stems and Ca2+and Mg2+ in the leaves were increased.There were two types for the content levels of Na+ and Cl-ions in stems and leaves of the survival plants,i.e.a low-level accumulation and a high-level accumulation,suggesting that the salt-tolerant wild soybean lines may have two kinds of mechanisms for the salt tole-rance:one is high bearing and another is low absorption.",

        "abstract": "Pathogen effectors are virulence factors causing plant diseases. How the host targets of these effectors facilitate pathogen infection is largely unknown. An effector of Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) transcriptionally activates rice (Oryza sativa) susceptibility gene Xa13 to cause bacterial blight disease. Xa13 encodes an indispensable plasma membrane protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes with unknown biochemical function. We show that the XA13 protein cooperates with two other proteins, COPT1 and COPT5, to promote removal of copper from xylem vessels, where Xoo multiplies and spreads to cause disease. Copper, an essential micronutrient of plants and an important element for a number of pesticides in agriculture, suppresses Xoo growth. Xoo strain PXO99 is more sensitive to copper than other strains; its infection of rice is associated with activation of XA13, COPT1, and COPT5, which modulate copper redistribution in rice. The involvement of XA13 in copper redistribution has led us to propose a mechanism of bacterial virulence.",

        "abstract": "Plants use a complex signal transduction network to regulate their adaptation to the ever-changing environment. Rice (Oryza sativa) WRKY13 plays a vital role in the cross talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways by suppressing abiotic stress resistance and activating disease resistance. However, it is not clear how WRKY13 directly regulates this cross talk. Here, we show that WRKY13 is a transcriptional repressor. During the rice responses to drought stress and bacterial infection, WRKY13 selectively bound to certain site- and sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of SNAC1 (for STRESS RESPONSIVE NO APICAL MERISTEM, ARABIDOPSIS TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATION FACTOR1/2, CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON), the overexpression of which increases drought resistance, and WRKY45-1, the knockout of which increases both bacterial disease and drought resistance. WRKY13 also bound to two cis-elements of its native promoter to autoregulate the balance of its gene expression in different physiological activities. WRKY13 was induced in leaf vascular tissue, where bacteria proliferate, during infection, and in guard cells, where the transcriptional factor SNAC1 enhances drought resistance, during both bacterial infection and drought stress. These results suggest that WRKY13 regulates the antagonistic cross talk between drought and disease resistance pathways by directly suppressing SNAC1 and WRKY45-1 and autoregulating its own expression via site- and sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of these genes in vascular tissue where bacteria proliferate and guard cells where the transcriptional factor SNAC1 mediates drought resistance by promoting stomatal closure.",

However, knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of tissue-specific gene expression and practicable tissue-specific promoters is limited. In this study, we identified the cis-acting elements of a tissue-specific promoter from rice, P(D54O), and tested the application of original and modified P(D54O) and its cis-elements in the regulation of gene expression. P(D54O) is a green tissue-specific promoter. Five novel tissue-specific cis-elements (LPSE1, LPSE2, LPSRE1, LPSRE2, PSE1) were characterized from P(D54O). LPSE1 activated gene expression in leaf and young panicle. LPSRE2 suppressed gene expression in leaf, root, young panicle and stem, and PSE1 suppressed gene expression in young panicle and stem. LPSRE1 and LPSE2 had dual roles in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression; both functioned as activators in leaf, but LPSRE1 acted as a repressor in stem and LPSE2 as a repressor in young panicle and root. Transgenic rice plants carrying cry1Ac encoding Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin, regulated by P(D54O), were resistant to leaf-folders, with no Cry1Ac protein found in endosperm or embryo. A reporter gene regulated by a series of truncated P(D54O) showed various tissue-specific expression patterns. Different fragments of P(D54O) fused with the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter suppressed 35S-regulated gene expression in various tissues. P(D54O), truncated P(D54O) and the tissue-specific cis-elements provide useful tools for the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression in rice breeding programmes.",

        "abstract": "Aims Wild soybean (Glycine soja) is commonly accepted as the progenitor species of the cultivated soybean (Giycine max). It contains many characters potentially valuable for supplementing the soybean germplasm pool, yet little research has been done on genetic diversity in natural popula-tions of wild soybean in China. Our objective was to evaluate genetic diversity in natural populations of wild soybean growing in the region of Beijing, China. Methods We sampled ten representative natural populations in 2005. Every sampled population con-sisted of 28-30 individuals and was over 10 m apart. Forty public SSR primer pairs over the 20 linkage groups were applied to evaluate genetic diversity. Important findings A total of 526 alleles (bands) were detected with an average number of 13.15 per locus. Mean expected heterozygosity per locus (He) was 0.369 for the populations, and the mean Shan-non index (I) for the populations was 0.658. Mean observed heterozygosity per locus (Ho) for the popu-lations was 1.29%. Between-population genetic diversity (Hs) averaged 0.446, and within-population genetic diversity (DST) averaged 0.362. Mean coefficient of gene differentiation for loci (GST) in the populations was estimated to be 0.544. This study showed that the center-western ecotype had higher genetic diversity than the northern and eastern ecotypes and that there appeared to be ecogeographically genetic divergence in the natural populations between the Taihang and the Yanshan mountains. A strongly drought-tolerant population had very low genetic diversity, and its tolerance gene(s) may be exploited for breeding.",

Although at least 17 rice MAPKs have been identified and more than half of these MAPK genes have been shown to be pathogen or elicitor responsive, the exact role of most of the MAPKs in host-pathogen interaction is unknown. Here we report that OsMPK6 is an important regulator in rice disease resistance. Suppressing OsMPK6 or knocking out of OsMPK6 enhanced rice resistance to different races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The resistant plants showed increased expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning in the NH1 (an Arabidopsis NPR1 orthologue)-involved defense signal transduction pathway. These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion.",

        "abstract": "Photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile (PSGMS) rice, in which pollen fertility is regulated by day-length, originally arose as a natural mutant in the rice cultivar Nongken 58 (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). Previous studies identified pms3 on chromosome 12 as the locus of the original PSGMS mutation. In this study we have assigned the pms3 locus to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment by genetic and physical mapping. A cross between Nongken 58S (PSGMS line) and DH80 was used to produce an F2 population of about 7000 plants, from which 892 highly sterile individuals were obtained for recombination analysis. By analyzing recombination events in the sterile individuals using a total of 157 RFLP probes from a BAC contig covering the pms3 region, the pms3 locus was localized to a sub-region of less than 1.7 cM. Further analysis of recombination events using 49 additional probes isolated from this sub-region identified markers flanking the pms3 region on each side; these markers are only 28.4-kb apart. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted the presence of five ORFs, found high homology with two ESTs in public databases, and detected three SNPs between the mutant and the wild-type parents, which may be helpful for identifying a candidate gene for pms3.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid sterility is a major form of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Although reproductive isolation has been a key issue in evolutionary biology for many decades in a wide range of organisms, only very recently a few genes for reproductive isolation were identified. The Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is divided into two subspecies, indica and japonica. Hybrids between indica and japonica varieties are usually highly sterile. A special group of rice germplasm, referred to as wide-compatibility varieties, is able to produce highly fertile hybrids when crossed to both indica and japonica. In this study, we cloned S5, a major locus for indica-japonica hybrid sterility and wide compatibility, using a map-based cloning approach. We show that S5 encodes an aspartic protease conditioning embryo-sac fertility. The indica (S5-i) and japonica (S5-j) alleles differ by two nucleotides. The wide compatibility gene (S5-n) has a large deletion in the N terminus of the predicted S5 protein, causing subcellular mislocalization of the protein, and thus is presumably nonfunctional. This triallelic system has a profound implication in the evolution and artificial breeding of cultivated rice. Genetic differentiation between indica and japonica would have been enforced because of the reproductive barrier caused by S5-i and S5-j, and species coherence would have been maintained by gene flow enabled by the wide compatibility gene.",

        "abstract": "Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most serious rice diseases worldwide. A rice gene, Xa26, conferring resistance against Xoo at both seedling and adult stages was isolated by map-based cloning strategies from the rice cultivar Minghui 63. Xa26 belongs to a multigene family consisting of four members. It encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like protein and is constitutively expressed. Sequence analysis revealed that IRBB3 and Zhachanglong lines that are resistant to a broad range of Xoo strains, also carry Xa26. However, significant difference in lesion length was observed among these lines after inoculation with a set of Xoo strains. Moreover, transgenic plants carrying Xa26 showed enhanced resistance compared with the donor line of the gene in both seedling and adult stages. These results suggest that the resistance conferred by Xa26 is influenced by the genetic background.",

        "abstract": "Despite the significant contributions of utilizing heterosis to crop productivity worldwide, the biological mechanisms of heterosis remained largely uncharacterized. In this study, we analyzed gene expression profiles of an elite rice hybrid and the parents at three stages of young panicle development, using a cDNA microarray consisting of 9198 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), with the objective to reveal patterns of gene expression that may be associated with heterosis in yield. A total of 8422 sequences showed hybridization signals in all three genotypes in at least one stage and 5771 sequences produced detectable signals in all slides. Significant differences in expression level were detected for 438 sequences among the three genotypes in at least one of the three stages, as determined by ANOVA validated with 100 permutations at P < 0.05. Significant mid-parent heterosis was detected for 141 sequences, which demonstrated the following features: a much larger number of sequences showed negative heterosis than ones showing positive heterosis; genes functioning in DNA replication and repair tended to show positive heterosis; genes functioning in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, translation, protein degradation, and cellular information processing showed negative heterosis; both positive and negative heterosis were observed for genes in amino acid metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, plant defense and transportation. The results are indicative of the biochemical and physiological activities taking place in the hybrid relative to the parents. Identification of genes showing expression polymorphisms among different genotypes and heterotic expression in the hybrid may provide new avenues for exploring the biological mechanisms underlying heterosis.",

        "abstract": "Xa3-mediated resistance for rice bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, is influenced by genetic background. Xa3 is genetically tightly linked to Xa26, another gene for bacterial blight resistance. Xa26 belongs to a clustered multigene family encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like proteins. To characterize Xa3, we fine mapped it using a population segregating for only one resistance gene and markers developed from Xa26 family. Genetic analysis showed that Xa3 co-segregated with the marker of Xa26 gene and segregated from the markers of other members of Xa26 family. DNA fingerprinting revealed that rice line IRBB3 carrying Xa3 had the same copy numbers of Xa26 family members as rice line Minghui 63 carrying Xa26. Phenotypic comparison showed that all the rice lines carrying either Xa3 or Xa26 developed dark brown deposition at the border between the lesion caused by incompatible-pathogen infection and health leaf tissue, while other rice lines did not show this dark brown deposition in either incompatible or compatible interactions. These results suggest that Xa3 and Xa26 is the same gene. We name it Xa3/Xa26 to indicate the relationship between the two gene symbols. The putative encoding products of Xa3/Xa26 and its susceptible allele xa3/xa26 shared 92% sequence identity. The sequence difference occurred in the LRR domains, specifically at the solvent-exposed amino acid residues, might be the major cause that differentiates the resistant and susceptible proteins.",

Ant system (AS), as one of the earliest ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms, provides approximate solutions to 0/1 KPs. However, there are some shortcomings such as low efficiency and premature convergence in most AS algorithms. In order to overcome the shortcomings of AS, this paper proposes a rank-based AS algorithm, denoted as RAS to solve 0/1 KP. Taking advantages of the ranked ants with a higher profit, the pheromone of items will be updated with better solutions in RAS. Experimental results in different datasets show that this new kind of AS algorithm can obtain a higher efficiency and robustness when solving 0/1 KP.",

        "abstract": "Grain yield in many cereal crops is largely determined by grain size. Here we report the genetic and molecular characterization of GS3, a major quantitative trait locus for grain size. It functions as a negative regulator of grain size and organ size. The wild-type isoform is composed of four putative domains: a plant-specific organ size regulation (OSR) domain in the N terminus, a transmembrane domain, a tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR/NGFR) family cysteine-rich domain, and a von Willebrand factor type C (VWFC) in the C terminus. These domains function differentially in grain size regulation. The OSR domain is both necessary and sufficient for functioning as a negative regulator. The wild-type allele corresponds to medium grain. Loss of function of OSR results in long grain. The C-terminal TNFR/NGFR and VWFC domains show an inhibitory effect on the OSR function; loss-of-function mutations of these domains produced very short grain. This study linked the functional domains of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice.",

        "abstract": "The genetic basis of heterosis in rice was studied in a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, the parents of the best hybrid widely used in rice production in China. Field data for yield and yield components traits were collected over two years from 240 F(2:3) families of this cross planted in replicated field trials. These families were assayed with 151 marker loci that were polymorphic between the parents and a linkage map was constructed with Mapmaker analysis. A total of 32 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for yield and the three component traits: 12 QTLs were detected in both years and the remaining 20 QTLs were observed in only one year. A search for the entire genome by using two-way analyses of variance with all possible two-locus combinations detected a very large number of significant digenic interactions involving both the QTLs resolved by single-locus analysis and loci that did not show significant effects by single-locus analysis. Many of the interactions were simultaneously detected in both years. Partitioning of the epistatic interactions recovered all three types of interactions, i. e. additive by additive, additive by dominance and dominance by dominance, for all the traits. Some of the epistatic interactions even showed pleiotropic effects by simultaneously affecting two or more traits. The results clearly indicate that epistasis plays a significant role in the inheritance of yield traits as well as in the genetic basis of heterosis.",

        "abstract": "Rice Xa3/Xa26 disease-resistance gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and belongs to a multigene family. However, the functions of most genes in this family are unknown.Here we report that two orthologs of this family, the NRKe from rice variety Nipponbare and 9RKe from variety 93-11 at the RKe locus, have similar functions although they encode different proteins. This pair of orthologs could not mediate resistance to Xoo, but they were transcriptionally induced by raised temperature. Transcriptional activation of NRKe or 9RKe resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants. These plants were more sensitive to high temperature shock than wild-type controls. Transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of NRKe and the kinase domain of Xa3/Xa26 developed the same lesion mimics as the NRKe-transgenic plants, whereas transgenic plants carrying another chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of Xa3/Xa26 and the kinase domain of NRKe were free of lesion mimic. All the transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein were susceptible to Xoo.These results suggest that the RKe locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature. The LRR domain of RKe protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature. The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap.",

        "abstract": "Approximately one third of the identified 34 rice major disease resistance (R) genes conferring race-specific resistance to different strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes rice bacterial blight disease, are recessive genes. However, only two of the recessive resistance genes have been characterized thus far. Here we report the characterization of another recessive resistance gene, xa25, for Xoo resistance. The xa25, localized in the centromeric region of chromosome 12, mediates race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339 at both seedling and adult stages by inhibiting Xoo growth. It encodes a protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes, including mammals. Transformation of the dominant Xa25 into a resistant rice line carrying the recessive xa25 abolished its resistance to PXO339. The encoding proteins of recessive xa25 and its dominant allele Xa25 have eight amino acid differences. The expression of dominant Xa25 but not recessive xa25 was rapidly induced by PXO339 but not other Xoo strain infections. The nature of xa25-encoding protein and its expression pattern in comparison with its susceptible allele in rice-Xoo interaction indicate that the mechanism of xa25-mediated resistance appears to be different from that conferred by most of the characterized R proteins.",

We fine mapped a fully recessive gene, xa24, for bacterial blight resistance to a 71-kb DNA fragment in the long arm of rice chromosome 2 using polymerase chain reaction-based\n molecular markers. The xa24 gene confers disease resistance at the seedling and adult stages. It mediates resistance to at least the Philippine Xoo races 4, 6 and 10 and Chinese Xoo strains Zhe173, JL691 and KS-1-21. Sequence analysis of the DNA fragment harboring the dominant (susceptible) allele of xa24 suggests that this gene should encode a novel protein that is not homologous to any known R proteins. These results will\n greatly facilitate the isolation and characterization of xa24. The markers will be convenient tools for marker-assisted selection of xa24 in breeding programs.",

Unlike other species possessing a single RPA2 gene, rice (Oryza sativa) possesses three RPA2 paralogs, but their functions remain unclear. In this study, we identified RPA2c, a rice gene preferentially expressed during meiosis. A T-DNA insertional mutant (rpa2c) exhibited reduced bivalent formation, leading to chromosome nondisjunction. In rpa2c, chiasma frequency is reduced by ~78% compared with the wild type and is accompanied by loss of the obligate chiasma. The residual ~22% chiasmata fit a Poisson distribution, suggesting loss of crossover control. RPA2c colocalized with the meiotic cohesion subunit REC8 and the axis-associated protein PAIR2. Localization of REC8 was necessary for loading of RPA2c to the chromosomes. In addition, RPA2c partially colocalized with MER3 during late leptotene, thus indicating that RPA2c is required for class I crossover formation at a late stage of homologous recombination. Furthermore, we identified RPA1c, an RPA1 subunit with nearly overlapping distribution to RPA2c, required for ~79% of chiasmata formation. Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice.",

        "abstract": "Plants always adjust the opening of stomatal pores to adapt to the environment, for example CO concentration ([CO ]), humidity and temperature. Low [CO ] will trigger the opening of stomatal pores to absorb extra CO . However, little is known about how CO supply affects the carbon fixation and opening of stomatal pores in rice. Here, a chloroplast-located gene coding for β-carbonic anhydrase (βCA) was found to be involved in carbon assimilation and the CO -mediated stomatal pore response in rice. OsβCA1 was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its transcripts were induced by high [CO ] in leaves. Both T-DNA mutant and RNA interference lines showed phenotypes of lower biomass and CA activities. Knockout of OsβCA1 obviously decreased photosynthetic capacity, as demonstrated by the increased CO compensation point and decreased light saturation point in the mutant, while knockout increased the opening ratio of stomatal pores and the rate of water loss. Moreover, the mutant showed a delayed response to low [CO ], and stomatal pores could not be closed to the same degree as those of wild type even though the stomatal pores could rapidly respond to high [CO ]. Genome-wide gene expression analysis via RNA sequencing demonstrated that the transcript abundance of genes related to Rubisco, photosystem compounds and the opening of stomatal pores was globally upregulated in the mutant. Taken together, the inadequate CO supply caused by the absence of OsβCA1 reduces photosynthetic efficiency, triggers the opening of stomatal pores and finally decreases their sensitivity to CO fluctuation.",

        "abstract": "Locating the source of propagation is a ubiquitous but challenging problem in the field of complex networks. The traditional source location methods based on a set of observers can achieve a high locating accuracy. However, such high accuracy is based on the consistent assumption which means the propagation delays consistently follow a certain distribution in both the infected time calculation process and the source location process. Based on our simulation results and existing researches, we find that the real propagation delays, in some real-world scenarios, often break such consistent assumption and the predication accuracy of existing methods decline significantly in these circumstances. Therefore it raises a critical question: can we locate the infection source without assuming the distribution of propagation delays? In this paper, we first formulate the problem of locating source as inferring the parameters of propagation delays based on a set of observers. Then, we propose a novel reverse propagation strategy to locate infection source. Finally, a comprehensive comparisons are used to provide a quantitative analyses of our method. The results show that our strategy has a higher accuracy than the traditional methods without the consistent assumptions.",

        "abstract": "The GS3 locus located in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 3 has been frequently identified as a major QTL for both grain weight (a yield trait) and grain length (a quality trait) in the literature. Near isogenic lines of GS3 were developed by successive crossing and backcrossing Minghui 63 (large grain) with Chuan 7 (small grain), using Minghui 63 as the recurrent parent. Analysis of a random subpopulation of 201 individuals from the BC3F2 progeny confirmed that the GS3 locus explained 80-90% of the variation for grain weight and length in this population. In addition, this locus was resolved as a minor QTL for grain width and thickness. Using 1,384 individuals with recessive phenotype (large grain) from a total of 5,740 BC3F2 plants and 11 molecular markers based on sequence information, GS3 was mapped to a DNA fragment approximately 7.9 kb in length. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the target region was identified, which provided complete sequence information for the GS3 candidate. This gene consists of five exons and encodes 232 amino acids with a putative PEBP-like domain, a transmembrane region, a putative TNFR/NGFR family cysteine-rich domain and a VWFC module. Comparative sequencing analysis identified a nonsense mutation, shared among all the large-grain varieties tested in comparison with the small grain varieties, in the second exon of the putative GS3 gene. This mutation causes a 178-aa truncation in the C-terminus of the predicted protein, suggesting that GS3 may function as a negative regulator for grain size. Cloning of such a gene provided the opportunity for fully characterizing the regulatory mechanism and related processes during grain development.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To understand the effects of Rgl of ginsenoside on glucose and adjusted hormone of related glucose with changes of blood concentration during swimming in rats, and provide experimental evidence to clarify its anti-fatigue function. METHODS: The experiment was conducted at the animal laboratory of Hunan Normal University from January to June 2003, including two experiments. 1 Totally 42 rats were assigned randomly into 6 groups averagely (n=7), in which the rats in 5 groups were treated with 5,10,15,25 or 30 mg/kg per day continuously for 2 days Rgl of ginsenoside through intraperitoneal injection, and those in the other group were treated with saline at the same volume through intraperitoneal injection. The swimming time to exhaustion was detected. 2 Eighty-four rats were divided randomly into 12 groups (n=7), including 6 Rgl of ginsenoside administration groups, and 6 saline control groups. The rats in the administration group were treated with 20 mg/kg per day Rgl of ginsenoside continuously for 2 days, and those in the control group were treated with saline at the same volume. Then under the quiet situation, the concentrations of blood lactic acid and glucose and content of glycogen were detected after swimming for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Totally 126 rats were involved in the result analysis, without drop. 1 Effects of Rgl of ginsenoside on swimming time to exhaustion in rats: The swimming time to exhaustion in every administration group, over 15 mg/kg per day in Rgl of ginsenoside administration group was longer than that in the control group (6.11±0.52),(6.29±0.65),(6.23±0.57)h,(4.00±0.37)hours, P < 0.05, P < 0.01 . Within 5-25 mg/kg per day, with the increase of dosage, the swimming time to exhaustion prolonged significantly. 2 Effects of Rgl of ginsenoside on contents of muscle and liver starch: Under quiet situation, the contents of muscle and liver starch in the administration group and control group were equal mostly. During swimming, the contents of muscle and liver starch in the administration group and control group decreased with the prolongation of swimming time. But the decrease was slow in the administration group. The decrease in the administration group was 30% after swimming for 3 hours, and it decreased by 70% after swimming for the same time in the control group. 3 Effects of Rgl of ginsenoside on concentration of blood lactic acid during swimming in rats: The increase of concentration of blood lactic acid in the Rgl of ginsenoside administration group was insignificant; While the concentration of blood lactic acid in the control group increased greatly, reaching the peak after moving for 1 hour, which was the 4 times of that under quiet situation. The concentration of blood lactic acid after swimming for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 hours was lower than that in the each corresponding control group. 4 Effects of Rgl of ginsenoside on concentration of glucose during swimming in rats: During swimming, concentration of glucose in the administration group decreased slightly, while it was significant in the control group. After moving for 1, 2 and 3 hours the decreases were 24% 30% and 35% in order, and the range of decrease was larger significantly than that in the quiet group or corresponding administration group. CONCLUSION: The Rgl of ginsenoside has the effects on relieving the decrease of glucose, preventing the occurrence of motility low glucose, which can be induced by excretion or changes of activity of adjusted hormone of related glucose.",

        "title": "Patterns of genome-wide allele-specific expression in hybrid rice and the implications on the genetic basis of heterosis.",
        "abstract": "Utilization of heterosis has greatly increased the productivity of many crops worldwide. Although tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the genetic basis of heterosis using genomic technologies, molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic components are much less understood. Allele-specific expression (ASE), or imbalance between the expression levels of two parental alleles in the hybrid, has been suggested as a mechanism of heterosis. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of ASE by comparing the read ratios of the parental alleles in RNA-sequencing data of an elite rice hybrid and its parents using three tissues from plants grown under four conditions. The analysis identified a total of 3,270 genes showing ASE (ASEGs) in various ways, which can be classified into two patterns: consistent ASEGs such that the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in all tissues/conditions, and inconsistent ASEGs such that ASE was found in some but not all tissues/conditions, including direction-shifting ASEGs in which the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in some tissues/conditions while toward the other parental allele in other tissues/conditions. The results suggested that these patterns may have distinct implications in the genetic basis of heterosis: The consistent ASEGs may cause partial to full dominance effects on the traits that they regulate, and direction-shifting ASEGs may cause overdominance. We also showed that ASEGs were significantly enriched in genomic regions that were differentially selected during rice breeding. These ASEGs provide an index of the genes for future pursuit of the genetic and molecular mechanism of heterosis.",

In this study, we analyzed the QTLs, epistatic effects and QTL by environment interactions (QE) underlying nine traits of yield and yield-component, using a doubled-haploid (DH) population consisted of 190 lines from the cross between an indica parent Zhenshan 97 and a japonica parent WYJ 2, and tested in two-year replicated field trials. A genetic linkage map with 179 SSR (simple sequence repeat) marker loci was constructed. A mixed linear model approach was applied to detect QTLs, digenic interactions and QEs for the nine traits. In total, 57 QTLs of main effects, 41 digenic interactions, eight QEs and seven interactions of epistasis by environment were detected. Each of the main-effect QTLs individually explained 1.3 % to 25.8% of the phenotypic variations. And they collectively explained 11.5% to 66.8% of the phenotypic variations for these traits. Most of the traits (except seed setting) had the QTLs simultaneously detected in two years. Many of the traits shared same QTLs with each other, which is consistent with their significant phenotypic correlations. The pleiotropism or tight linkage of QTLs for different traits might be the important genetic base for trait correlations. The environmental influences on the stability of the trait performance were also discussed.",

PXO99 causes rice disease by inducing Xa13. It is unknown, however, whether the UPT(PthXo1) box is the only PXO99-responsive cis-regulating elements in the activation of Xa13 expression. We analyzed the expression of a series of end- and site-truncated and site-mutated Xa13 promoters in rice and the binding of PXO99 protein to the intact, partial, or site-mutated UPT(PthXo1) boxes. In the Xa13 promoter, UPT(PthXo1) box is the only Xoo-responsive cis-acting element that results in PXO99-induced Xa13 expression. The 5'-terminal second, third, and fourth nucleotides of the box are important for bacterial protein binding and gene activation; mutation of any one of these sites abolished PXO99-induced gene expression. Furthermore, the 3'-half of the UPT(PthXo1) box is also required for protein binding and gene activation. These findings will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the interaction of rice and Xoo via UPT boxes and TAL effectors.",

        "abstract": "With the development of intelligent transportation systems, the estimation of traffic flow in urban areas has attracted a great attention of researchers. The timely and accurate travel information of urban residents could assist users in planning their travel strategies and improve the operational efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Currently, the origin-destination (OD) flows of urban residents are formulated as an OD matrix, which is used to denote the travel patterns of urban residents. In this paper, a simple and effective model, called NMF-AR, is proposed for predicting the OD matrices through combining the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm and the Autoregressive (AR) model. The basic characteristics of travel flows are first revealed based on the NMF algorithm. Then, the nonlinear time series coefficient matrix, extracted from the NMF algorithm, is estimated based on the AR model. Finally, we predict OD matrices based on the estimated coefficient matrix and the basis matrix of NMF. Extensive experiments have been implemented, in collected real data about taxi GPS information in Beijing, for comparing our proposed algorithm with some known methods, such as different kinds of    $K$   -nearest neighbor algorithms, neural network algorithms and classification algorithms. The results show that our proposed NMF-AR algorithm have a more effective capability in predicting OD matrices than other models.",

        "abstract": "Heading date is a critical trait that determines cropping seasons and regional adaptability in rice (Oryza sativa). Research efforts during the last decade have identified some important photoperiod pathway genes that are conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we identified a novel gene, Oryza sativa ELF3 (OsELF3), which is a putative homolog of the ELF3 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. OsELF3 was required for the control of heading date under long-day conditions. Its Tos17-tagging mutants exhibited a delayed heading date phenotype only under long-day, but not short-day, conditions. OsELF3 was highly expressed in leaf blades, and the OsELF3 protein was localized in the nucleolus. An obvious diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 transcript level was observed, with a trough in the early day and a peak in the late night in wild-type plants. However, this expression pattern was disrupted in oself3 mutants. Further investigations showed that the expression of OsGI and Ghd7 was up-regulated in the oself3 mutant, indicating that OsELF3 acts as a negative regulator upstream of OsGI and Ghd7 in the flowering-time control under long-day conditions. The rhythmic expression of circadian clock-related genes, including some OsPRR members, was obviously affected in oself3 mutants. Our results indicated that OsELF3 acts as a floral activator in the long-day photoperiodic pathway via its crosstalk with the circadian clock in rice.",

Previously, we reported that the transcription factor OsbZIP46 regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling-mediated drought tolerance in rice () by modulating stress-related genes. An intrinsic D domain represses OsbZIP46 activity, but the detailed mechanism for the repression of OsbZIP46 activation remains unknown. Here, we report an OsbZIP46-interacting protein, MODD (Mediator of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation), which is homologous to the  ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 binding protein AFP.  was induced by ABA and drought stress, but the induction was much slower than that of  In contrast to OsbZIP46, MODD negatively regulates ABA signaling and drought tolerance, and inhibits the expression of OsbZIP46 target genes. We found that MODD negatively regulates OsbZIP46 activity and stability. MODD represses OsbZIP46 activity via interaction with the OsTPR3-HDA702 corepressor complex and downregulation of the histone acetylation level at OsbZIP46 target genes. MODD promotes OsbZIP46 degradation via interaction with the U-box type ubiquitin E3 ligase OsPUB70. Interestingly, the D domain is required for both deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 via its interaction with MODD. These findings show that plants fine-tune their drought responses by elaborate regulatory mechanisms, including the coordination of activity and stability of key transcription factors.",

However, the roles of plant tubby-like proteins are unknown. In this study, we have defined the tubby-like protein gene (OsTLP) family with 14 members in rice. Most of the OsTLPs harbor a tubby domain in their carboxyl terminus and an F-box domain in the amino terminus. The expression of all the OsTLPs was induced on infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The maximal expression levels were observed at 2-8 h after infection for all the genes. Eight of the 14 OsTLPs were also responsive to wounding. All the OsTLPs showed differential expression in different tissues at different developmental stages. However, four pairs of the 14 OsTLPs, with each pair having high sequence similarity and distributing on the similar position of different chromosomes, showed similar expression pattern in different tissues, indicating their direct relationship in evolution. These results suggest that the OsTLP family is involved in host-pathogen interaction and it may be also associated with other physiological and developmental activities.",

        "abstract": "Xa3-mediated resistance for rice bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, is influenced by genetic background. Xa3 is genetically tightly linked to Xa26, another gene for bacterial blight resistance. Xa26 belongs to a clustered multigene family encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like proteins. To characterize Xa3, we fine mapped it using a population segregating for only one resistance gene and markers developed from Xa26 family. Genetic analysis showed that Xa3 co-segregated with the marker of Xa26 gene and segregated from the markers of other members of Xa26 family. DNA fingerprinting revealed that rice line IRBB3 carrying Xa3 had the same copy numbers of Xa26 family members as rice line Minghui 63 carrying Xa26. Phenotypic comparison showed that all the rice lines carrying either Xa3 or Xa26 developed dark brown deposition at the border between the lesion caused by incompatible-pathogen infection and health leaf tissue, while other rice lines did not show this dark brown deposition in either incompatible or compatible interactions. These results suggest that Xa3 and Xa26 is the same gene. We name it Xa3/Xa26 to indicate the relationship between the two gene symbols. The putative encoding products of Xa3/Xa26 and its susceptible allele xa3/xa26 shared 92% sequence identity. The sequence difference occurred in the LRR domains, specifically at the solvent-exposed amino acid residues, might be the major cause that differentiates the resistant and susceptible proteins.",

        "abstract": "The copper (Cu) transporter (COPT/Ctr) gene family has an important role in the maintenance of Cu homeostasis in different species. The rice COPT-type gene family consists of seven members (COPT1 to COPT7). However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport.Here we report the molecular and functional characterization of the other five members of the rice COPT gene family (COPT2, COPT3, COPT4, COPT6, and COPT7). All members of the rice COPT family have the conserved features of known COPT/Ctr-type Cu transporter genes. Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and COPT5. COPT2, COPT3, or COPT4 cooperating with COPT6 mediated a high-affinity Cu uptake in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that lacked the functions of ScCtr1 and ScCtr3 for Cu uptake. COPT7 alone could mediate a high-affinity Cu uptake in the yeast mutant. None of the seven COPTs alone or in cooperation could complement the phenotypes of S. cerevisiae mutants that lacked the transporter genes either for iron uptake or for zinc uptake. However, these COPT genes, which showed different tissue-specific expression patterns and Cu level-regulated expression patterns, were also transcriptionally influenced by deficiency of iron, manganese, or zinc.These results suggest that COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 may cooperate with COPT6, respectively, and COPT7 acts alone for Cu transport in different rice tissues. The endogenous concentrations of iron, manganese, or zinc may influence Cu homeostasis by influencing the expression of COPTs in rice.",

        "abstract": "Culm mechanical strength is an important agronomic trait in crop breeding. To understand the molecular mechanisms that control\n culm mechanical strength, we identified a flexible culm1 (fc1) mutant by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library. This mutant exhibited an abnormal development phenotype, including\n late heading time, semi-dwarf habit, and flexible culm. In this study, we cloned the FLEXIBLE CULM1 (FC1) gene in rice using a T-DNA tagging approach. FC1 encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase and is mainly expressed in the sclerenchyma cells of the secondary cell wall and\n vascular bundle region. In these types of cells, a deficiency of FC1 in the fc1 mutant caused a reduction in cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in lignin. Extracts from the first internodes and\n panicles of the fc1 plants exhibited drastically reduced cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Further histological and biochemical analyses\n revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl and guaiacyl monomers in fc1 cell wall were reduced greatly. Our results indicated that FC1 plays an important role in the biosynthesis of lignin and the control of culm strength in rice.",

        "abstract": "A binary GAL4-VP16-UAS transactivation system has been established in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in this study for the discovery of gene functions. This binary system consists of two types of transgenic lines, pattern lines and target lines. The pattern lines were produced by transformation of Zhonghua 11, a japonica cultivar, with a construct consisting of the transactivator gene GAL4-VP16 controlled by a minimal promoter and the GUSplus reporter controlled by the upstream activation sequence (UAS; cis-element to GAL4). Target lines were generated by transformation of Zhonghua 11 with constructs carrying the EGFP reporter and target genes of interest, both controlled by the UAS but in opposite directions. Hybrid plants were obtained by crossing target lines of 10 putative transcription factor genes from rice with six pattern lines showing expression in anther, stigma, palea, lemma and leaves. The EGFP and target genes perfectly co-expressed in hybrid plants with the same expression patterns as in the pattern lines. Various phenotypic changes, such as delayed flowering, multiple pistils, dwarfism, narrow and droopy leaves, reduced tillers, growth retardation and sterility, were induced as a result of the expression of the target genes. It is concluded that this transactivation system can provide a useful tool in rice to unveil latent functions of unknown or known genes.",

        "abstract": "In rice (), hybrids between  and  subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, , composed of three adjacent genes (, , and ), regulates female gamete fertility of  hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed  (BL) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed  and  (BL) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL and BL showed that  induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.",

        "abstract": "This study was conducted to provide additional data for evaluating two important issues surrounding the origin of cultivated barley: (i) the level of genetic diversity of the two-rowed wild barley from Tibet, and (ii) the distribution of rDNA allele 104 in wild and cultivated barleys in the Occidental region. A total of 198 accessions consisting of three distinct samples were used: 82 entries of two-rowed wild barley from Tibet, 57 accessions of two-rowed wild barley from 8 countries with a broad range of representation of two-rowed wild barley in the world, and 59 landrace accessions from four countries representing a part of the barley-growing areas in the Middle East. These were assayed for rDNA spacer-length variants (slvs). In all, 27 rDNA space length phenotypes were detected, from which 10 slvs were identified as alleles at the two rDNA loci. The two-rowed wild barley samples from Tibet had the lowest level of genetic variation as evaluated by rDNA polymorphism. Together with results of previous studies, the two wild forms (two-rowed and six-rowed) from Tibet could not account for the large genetic diversity observed in the cultivated barley of this region, suggesting that Tibet is unlikely a centre of origin for cultivated barley. In samples from the Occidental region, allele 104 of Rrn2 was very rare in wild barley, but occurred at the highest frequency in cultivated barley, while the reverse is the case for allele 107, which is consistent with previous results. The implications of such a contrasting distribution of these rDNA alleles between wild and cultivated barleys in the origin and evolution of cultivated barley were discussed.",

GF14 genes in rice response to biotic and abiotic stress has also been well addressed. The role of GF14e in rice defense has been well studied. However, whether Hd3a and OsFD1 play roles in defense is unclear. In present study, we identified that Hd3a and OsFD1 expression is repressed by Xoo and JA, and validated that Hd3a and OsFD1 negatively regulate resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc). hd3a and osfd1 mutants increase resistance to Xoo and Xoc, and activate JA responsive genes expression. Our data also demonstrate that OsFD1 binds to the promoters of and activates the expression of JAZ genes; Hd3a, cooperating with GF14e, promotes OsFD1 action on JAZ gene expression. The functional confirmation of Hd3a and OsFD1 in rice defense makes them to be promising targets in molecular rice breeding.",

        "abstract": "Bi-objective Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP) is an NP-hard problem in the combinatorial optimization, which is also important question in the field of operations research and theoretical computer science. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one type of efficient methods for solving NP-hard problems. However, GA-based algorithms suffer high time computational complexity, low stability and the premature convergence for solving BTSP. This paper proposes an improved method of genetic algorithm based on a novel nature-inspired computational model to solve these problems. The initialization of population of proposed algorithm is first optimized by the prior knowledge of Physarum-inspired computational model (PCM) in order to enhance the computational speed and stability. Then the hill climbing method (HC) is used to increase the diversity of the individuals and avoid falling into the local optimum. A series of experiments are conducted and results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve the better performance.",

        "abstract": "Rice transcription regulator OsWRKY13 influences the functioning of more than 500 genes in multiple signalling pathways, with roles in disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development.To determine the putative transcriptional regulation mechanism of OsWRKY13, the putative cis-acting elements of OsWRKY13-influenced genes were analyzed using the whole genome expression profiling of OsWRKY13-activated plants generated with the Affymetrix GeneChip Rice Genome Array. At least 39 transcription factor genes were influenced by OsWRKY13, and 30 of them were downregulated. The promoters of OsWRKY13-upregulated genes were overrepresented with W-boxes for WRKY protein binding, whereas the promoters of OsWRKY13-downregulated genes were enriched with cis-elements putatively for binding of MYB and AP2/EREBP types of transcription factors. Consistent with the distinctive distribution of these cis-elements in up- and downregulated genes, nine WRKY genes were influenced by OsWRKY13 and the promoters of five of them were bound by OsWRKY13 in vitro; all seven differentially expressed AP2/EREBP genes and six of the seven differentially expressed MYB genes were suppressed by in OsWRKY13-activated plants. A subset of OsWRKY13-influenced WRKY genes were involved in host-pathogen interactions.These results suggest that OsWRKY13-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors. WRKY proteins may play important roles in the monitoring of OsWRKY13-upregulated genes and genes involved in pathogen-induced defence responses, whereas MYB and AP2/EREBP proteins may contribute most to the control of OsWRKY13-downregulated genes.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the most harmful bacterial disease of rice worldwide. Previously, we characterized major disease resistance (MR) gene xa25, which confers race-specific resistance to Xoo strain PXO339. The xa25 is a recessive allele of the SWEET13 locus, but SWEET13's interaction with PXO339 and how efficiently using this locus for rice breeding still need to be defined. Here we show that the SWEET13 allele from rice Zhenshan 97 is a susceptibility gene to PXO339. Using this allele's promoter to regulate xa25 resulted in disease, suggesting that the promoter is a key determinant in SWEET13 caused disease in Zhanshan 97 after PXO339 infection. PXO339 transcriptionally induces SWEET13 to cause disease. Partial suppressing SWEET13 expression leads to a high level of resistance to PXO339. Thus, the transcriptionally suppressed SWEET13 functions as xa25 in resistance to PXO339. Hybrid rice is widely grown in many countries. However, recessive MR genes have not been efficiently used for disease resistance breeding in hybrid rice production for both parents of the hybrid have to carry the same recessive gene. However, the suppressed SWEET13 functions dominantly, which will have advantage to improve the resistance of hybrid rice to xa25-incomptible Xoo.",

Here we show that a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), Chalk5, influences grain chalkiness, which also affects head rice yield and many other quality traits. Chalk5 encodes a vacuolar H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) with inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis and H(+)-translocation activity. Elevated expression of Chalk5 increases the chalkiness of the endosperm, putatively by disturbing the pH homeostasis of the endomembrane trafficking system in developing seeds, which affects the biogenesis of protein bodies and is coupled with a great increase in small vesicle-like structures, thus forming air spaces among endosperm storage substances and resulting in chalky grain. Our results indicate that two consensus nucleotide polymorphisms in the Chalk5 promoter in rice varieties might partly account for the differences in Chalk5 mRNA levels that contribute to natural variation in grain chalkiness.",

        "abstract": "The processes of urbanization and the expansion of urban scale are growing rapidly in China. Therefore, it is important to determine the influencing factors of the traffic flow. In order to evaluate the impact of internal and external flows, the area inside the Five Ring of Beijing is divided into several square-shaped areas. Each segment is defined as a node, and traffic flows between nodes serve as edges of a network. Then a traffic network is constructed based on above. After that, an empirical analysis of the network is implemented to reveal the dynamic changes of the power law exponent that characterizes the relationship between the mean value and division of traffic flows among nodes, in order to discover the fluctuation of traffic flow. The results show that, when the time interval is small, the internal flow and the external flow have similar effect on the traffic network. With the increase of time interval, the external flow has a greater influence on the network, rather than the internal traffic flow. This paper can help government officials in implementing the regulation of traffic.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes severe damage to rice (Oryza sativa) production worldwide. The major disease resistance gene, Xa3/Xa26, confers broad-spectrum and durable resistance to Xoo at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the Xa3/Xa26-initiated defense pathway against Xoo is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated resistance to Xoo. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Transcriptional suppression of OsTPI1.1 in plants harboring Xa3/Xa26 largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated resistance to Xoo, and constitutive overexpression of OsTPI1.1 in susceptible rice plants without Xa3/Xa26 only slightly decreased the susceptibility to Xoo. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated resistance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the resistance through its enzymatic activity, which was significantly enhanced by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of OsTPI1.1 decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced resistance to Xoo. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a resistance mechanism against Xoo.",

        "abstract": "We isolated 13 804 T-DNA flanking sequence tags (FSTs) from a T-DNA insertion library of rice. A comprehensive analysis of the 13 804 FSTs revealed a number of features demonstrating a highly non-random distribution of the T-DNA insertions in the rice genome: T-DNA insertions were biased towards large chromosomes, not only in the absolute number of insertions but also in the relative density; within chromosomes the insertions occurred more densely in the distal ends, and less densely in the centromeric regions; the distribution of the T-DNA insertions was highly correlated with that of full-length cDNAs, but the correlations were highly heterogeneous among the chromosomes; T-DNA insertions strongly disfavored transposable element (TE)-related sequences, but favored genic sequences with a strong bias toward the 5' upstream and 3' downstream regions of the genes; T-DNA insertions preferentially occurred among the various classes of functional genes, such that the numbers of insertions were in excess in certain functional categories but were deficient in other categories. The analysis of DNA sequence compositions around the T-DNA insertion sites also revealed several prominent features, including an elevated bendability from -200 to 200 bp relative to the insertion sites, an inverse relationship between the GC and TA skews, and reversed GC and TA skews in sequences upstream and downstream of the insertion sites, with both GC and TA skews equal to zero at the insertion sites. It was estimated that 365 380 insertions are needed to saturate the genome with P = 0.95, and that the 45 441 FSTs that have been isolated so far by various groups tagged 14 287 of the 42 653 non-TE related genes.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid rice has greatly contributed to the global increase of rice productivity. A major component that facilitated the development of hybrids was a mutant showing photoperiod-sensitive male sterility (PSMS) with its fertility regulated by day length. Transcriptome studies have shown that large portions of the eukaryotic genomic sequences are transcribed to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, the potential roles for only a few lncRNAs have been brought to light at present. Thus, great efforts have to be invested to understand the biological functions of lncRNAs. Here we show that a lncRNA of 1,236 bases in length, referred to as long-day-specific male-fertility-associated RNA (LDMAR), regulates PSMS in rice. We found that sufficient amount of the LDMAR transcript is required for normal pollen development of plants grown under long-day conditions. A spontaneous mutation causing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between the wild-type and mutant altered the secondary structure of LDMAR. This change brought about increased methylation in the putative promoter region of LDMAR, which reduced the transcription of LDMAR specifically under long-day conditions, resulting in premature programmed cell death (PCD) in developing anthers, thus causing PSMS. Thus, a lncRNA could directly exert a major effect on a trait like a structure gene, and a SNP could alter the function of a lncRNA similar to amino acid substitution in structural genes. Molecular elucidating of PSMS has important implications for understanding molecular mechanisms of photoperiod regulation of many biological processes and also for developing male sterile germplasms for hybrid crop breeding.",

Our results show that the two factors are associated with the expression of the R gene in rice Xa3 (also known as Xa26)-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which in turn influences the expression of defense-responsive genes. The background of japonica rice, one of the two major subspecies of Asian cultivated rice, facilitates the function of Xa3 more than the background of indica rice, another rice subspecies. Xa3 expression gradually increases from early seedling stage to adult stage. Japonica plants carrying Xa3 regulated by the native promoter showed an enlarged resistance spectrum (i.e., resistance to more Xoo races), an increased resistance level (i.e., further reduced lesion length), and whole-growth-stage resistance compared to the indica rice; this enhanced resistance was associated with an increased expression of Xa3 throughout the growth stages in the japonica plants, which resulted in enhanced expression of defense-responsive genes. Overexpressing Xa3 with a constitutive strong promoter further enhanced rice resistance due to further increased Xa3 transcripts in both indica and japonica backgrounds, whereas regulating Xa3 with a pathogen-induced weak promoter impaired rice resistance.",

Among those problem, the travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a very essential application of ACO algorithm, which displays the great ability of ACO algorithm to find short paths through graphs. However, the existing ant colony optimization algorithms still perform a low efficiency in solving TSP within a limited time. In order to overcome these shortcomings, a hypothesis about initializing the population size for ACO algorithms is put forward, based on the analysis of the relationship among the initial number of ant, the average optimal solution and the computational cost. Furthermore, some experiments are implemented in six datasets, and the results prove that the hypothesis is reasonable and reveal that the initial population size is relevant to the number of cities in a dataset. Based on the hypothesis, this paper proposes a novel strategy of initializing the number of ants for ACO algorithms in TSP, so that the relative high-quality optimal solutions can be obtained within a short time.",

        "abstract": "Huge efforts have been invested in the last two decades to dissect the genetic bases of complex traits including yields of many crop plants, through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. However, almost all the studies were based on linkage maps constructed using low-throughput molecular markers, e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs), thus are mostly of low density and not able to provide precise and complete information about the numbers and locations of the genes or QTLs controlling the traits. In this study, we constructed an ultra-high density genetic map based on high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from low-coverage sequences of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of rice, generated using new sequencing technology. The quality of the map was assessed by validating the positions of several cloned genes including GS3 and GW5/qSW5, two major QTLs for grain length and grain width respectively, and OsC1, a qualitative trait locus for pigmentation. In all the cases the loci could be precisely resolved to the bins where the genes are located, indicating high quality and accuracy of the map. The SNP map was used to perform QTL analysis for yield and three yield-component traits, number of tillers per plant, number of grains per panicle and grain weight, using data from field trials conducted over years, in comparison to QTL mapping based on RFLPs/SSRs. The SNP map detected more QTLs especially for grain weight, with precise map locations, demonstrating advantages in detecting power and resolution relative to the RFLP/SSR map. Thus this study provided an example for ultra-high density map construction using sequencing technology. Moreover, the results obtained are helpful for understanding the genetic bases of the yield traits and for fine mapping and cloning of QTLs.",

        "abstract": "In rice (Oryza sativa L.), hybrids between indica and japonica subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system S5 composed of three adjacent genes, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5, regulates female gamete fertility of indica-japonica hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed ORF5+ (BL5+) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed ORF3+ and ORF5+ (BL3+5+) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL5+ and BL showed that ORF5+ induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278 and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced ER stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress responsive genes, leading to PCD at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL3+5+/BL comparison, 3,986, 749 and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI and AME. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and PCD, producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive barriers.",

We illustrate marker assisted analysis of\n genetic differentiation with a sample of RFLP and isozyme data from 111 accessions of rice lines and compare it to morphological\n differentiation based on Cheng and Wang' morphological character index. The results lead to three main conclusions: (1) Among\n the 92 polymorphic cloned probes deliberately selected, 41 were highly associated with Indica-Japonica differentiation, suggesting\n such differentiation was an accumulative process of gene change at multiple loci; (2) There exist two main types of relationships\n between morphological and genetic differentiation. For well differentiated Indica and Japonica (as the case in the control\n subset), morphology and genomic constitutions are synchronously specialized. For incompletely differentiated rice lines (as\n the case in the subset of DH lines), morphological differentiation and genetic differentiation are asynchronous. (3)Synthetic\n or incompletely differentiated rice lines with different genomic constitutions are often adapted to specific environments.\n These results indicate that marker alleles provide applied breeders with effective ways to identify, track, and incorporate\n regions of chromosomes governing adaptedness to specific target environments into improved cultivars.",

It is a highly complex but ordered process involving expression of large scale senescence associated genes, and its molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. By using suppression subtractive hybridization, 815 ESTs that are up-regulated at the onset of rice flag leaf senescence have been isolated. A total of 533 unigenes have been confirmed by macroarray detection and sequencing. 183 of these unigenes have GO annotations, involved in macromolecule metabolism, protein biosynthesis regulation, energy metabolism, gene expression regulations, detoxification, pathogenicity and stress, cytoskeleton organization and flower development. Another 121 unigenes co-localized with previously reported known stay-green QTLS. RT-PCR analysis on the other novel genes indicated that they can be up-regulated in natural early senescence and induced by hormone. Our results indicate that senescence is closely related to various metabolic pathways, thus providing new insight into the onset of leaf senescence mechanism.",

The organization of the cellulose\n microfibrils in the cell wall is a key determinant of cell expansion. Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library. It is reported here that OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that exhibits typical structural features of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor protein.\n The T-DNA insertion in OsBC1L4 results in abnormal cell expansion. A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified\n in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components. OsBC1L4 was expressed in all tissues/organs examined, with a low level in leaves. OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall\n and plasma membrane. Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs). Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis.",

The resistant gene, cry1C*, driven by the rice rbcS promoter (small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), was introduced into Zhonghua 11 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.A total of 83 independent transformants were obtained, 19 of which were characterised as single-copy foreign gene insertion. After preliminary screening of the T(1) families of these 19 transformants in the field, six highly insect-resistant homozygous lines were selected. These six homozygous transgenic lines were field tested for resistance to leaf folders and stem borers, and for their agronomic performance. The Cry1C* protein levels in leaves and endosperm were measured by ELISA. Subsequently, the elite transgenic line RJ5 was selected; this line not only possessed high resistance to leaf folders and stem borers, normal agronomic performance, but also Cry1C* expression was only 2.6 ng g(-1) in the endosperm.These results indicated that RJ5 has the potential for widespread utility in rice production.",
