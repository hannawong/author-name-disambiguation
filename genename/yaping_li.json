        "abstract": "It is of great importance to control the thickness of catalytic components to enable maximum catalyst utilization and strong catalyst-substrate interaction since electrocatalytic reactions occurring at the interface of catalysts involve a one or two-atom thick active layer. Herein, we achieved an ultrathin deposition of a 2.5 ± 0.2 nm active layer containing atomically dispersed Mn-nitrogen-carbon (Mn-NC) materials on conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a solvothermal treatment of formamide and Mn salt, and applied the as-made Mn-NC/CNT composite without pyrolysis directly as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The atomic dispersion of Mn species in multiple nitrogen surroundings has been confirmed by combining high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photon spectroscopy. The as-prepared formamide-converted Mn-NC/CNT composite, used for catalyzing the ORR, exhibited a highly comparable performance in alkaline media relative to that of 20 wt% Pt/C by achieving a high onset potential and a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V and 0.83 V (vs. RHE), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further suggested that Mn-N moieties were capable of efficiently accelerating the release of *OH intermediates under a high reduction potential, thus exhibiting advanced ORR performance.",

        "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a major role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis by sensing and responding to AMP/ADP concentrations relative to ATP. AMPK has attracted widespread attention as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The structure-based 3D pharmacophore model was developed based on the training set. The best pharmacophore model Hypo5 was proposed and validated using a decoy set, an external test set. Hypo5, with the correlation coefficient value of 0.936, cost difference value of 112.08 and low RMS value of 1.63, includes a ionizable positive, a hydrogen bond donor, a hydrogen bond acceptor and two hydrophobic features, which showed a high goodness of fit and enrichment factor. Thus it was used as a 3D query to find potential activator from the SPECS Database. Then the ADMET descriptors were used to filter all of 158 screening molecules. The 41 filtering compounds were subsequently subjected to molecular docking and Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. Finally, the compound H2 was picked out from those filtering compounds based on the receptor-ligand interaction analysis and the prediction of the QSAR models. And then it was submitted for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the stability of complex. The result indicates that the candidate could be considered a potential AMPK activator.",

The expression of CK8 at the mRNA level was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of CK8 at the protein level was evaluated by Western blotting. We then constructed a eukaryotic expression combination vector containing the coding sequence of human full length CK8 gene. CK8 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into pEGFP-C1 and the positive clone pEGFP-CK8 was obtained. After confirming the sequence, the recombinant plasmid was transfected into SMMC7721 cells with lipofectamine2000 and CK8 expression was detected using inverted fluorescence microscopy, RT-PCR and Western blotting. Besides, we identified biological function of CK8 on SMMC7721 cells, including cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis detection.RT-PCR showed that the expression level of CK8 in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.88 and 2.95 times higher than in control cells. Western blot showed that CK8 expression in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.53 and 3.26 times higher than that in control cells, respectively. We found that CK8 at mRNA and protein levels were both significantly increased in HCVcc. CK8 was up-regulated in SMMC7721 cells. CK8 expression at the mRNA level was significantly upregulated in SMMC7721/pEGFP-CK8 cells. CK8 expression in SMMC7721/ pEGFP-CK8 cells was 2.69 times higher than in SMMC7721 cells, and was 2.64 times higher than in SMMC7721/pEGFP-C1 cells. CK8 expression at the protein level in SMMC7721/pEGFP-CK8 cells was 2.46 times higher than in SMMC7721 cells, and was 2.29 times higher than in SMMC7721/pEGFP-C1 cells. Further analysis demonstrated that forced expression of CK8 slowed cell growth and induced apoptosis of SMMC7721 cells.CK8 up-regulation might have a functional role in HCV infection and pathogenesis, and could be a promising target for the treatment of HCV infection.",

The effects of pH, concentration of phosphate buffer solution, SDS micelle concentration, methanol volume fraction, applied voltage and temperature on the separation were studied. It was found that the migration of these compounds was affected by these factors, especially by pH of the solution. The elution, as well as the migration time and separation efficiency of cefoperazone, its S-isomer, impurity A and other related substances changed with the acidity of the solution. The optimized separation conditions consisted of a running buffer of 70 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, at pH 6.5, containing 100 mmol/L SDS, with an applied voltage of 15 kV and a temperature of 25 degrees C. An uncoated fused-silica capillary of 51.0 cm x 75 microm (42.5 cm of effective length) was used. The sample was injected into the column by pressure (5 kPa) for 5 s. The detection wavelength was set at 254 nm. Twenty-eight impurities in cefoperazone sodium could be detected. Cefoperazone sodium and the degradation products could be separated well.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Advances in sensors benefit tremendously from the stimuli-responsive self-assembly technique. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and Aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) luminogens have emerged as reliable building blocks for optical sensor as they overcome many of the limitations of conventional fluorescent probes. In this report, we describe the first synthesis and photophysical properties of DBIA, a donor-acceptor (D-A) type AEE luminogen with red solid-sate emission. It shows stimuli-responsive self-assembly behavior upon fumigation with water steam. Our systematic investigation using microscopy has observed various supramolecular architectures with different relative humidity (RH) values at room temperature (25 °C), including rough-surfaced flocs structure (RH = 20%), nanorods (RH = 60%) and rectangular stratified microsheets (RH = 85%). In addition, there is a sharp increase in emission intensity when DBIA molecules are assembled in the presence of water steam, as the AEE mechanism is further reinforced in this case. Hydrogen bonding between DBIA and water molecule was detected by dynamic spectral analysis, and further proved by DFT calculation. Thus the mechanism for the stimuli-responsive self-assembly toward water and the consequent emission enhancement is illustrated. Taking advantage of the water-sensitivity, a water sensor was developed, affording a detection limit of 2.64 mM as a liquid water probe, and RH 22.5% as a humidity sensor. It also shows fast response, easy visualization, broad detection region and the capacity of resisting disturbance.",

Vaccines against EV71 have been proved effective and safe by recent phase 3 trials and are now available in China. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of a national EV71 vaccination program in China.Using Microsoft Excel, a decision model was built to calculate the net clinical and economic outcomes of EV71 vaccination compared with no EV71 vaccination in a birth cohort of 1,000,000 Chinese children followed for five years. Model parameters came from published epidemiology, clinical and cost data.In the base-case, vaccination would annually avert 37,872 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), 2,629 herpangina cases, 72,900 outpatient visits, 6,363 admissions to hospital, 29 deaths, and 945 disability adjusted life years. The break-even price of the vaccine was $5.2/dose. When the price was less than $8.3 or $14.6/dose, the vaccination program would be highly cost-effective or cost-effective, respectively (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than or between one to three times China GDP per capita, respectively). In one-way sensitivity analyses, the HFMD incidence was the only influential parameter at the price of $5/dose.Within the price range of current routine vaccines paid by the government, a national EV71 vaccination program would be cost-saving or highly cost-effective to prevent EV71 related morbidity, mortality, and use of health service among children younger than five years in China. Policy makers should consider including EV71 vaccination as part of China's routine childhood immunization schedule.",

The results showed that La 3+ promoted the proliferation of BMSCs except at 1×10 -10 and 1×10 -6 mol/L. The effect of La 3+ on the osteogenic differentiation depended on concentrations at the 7th day, but the osteogenic differentiation was inhibited at any concentration at the 14th day. La 3+ promoted the formation of mineralized matrix nodules except at 1×10 -8 and 1×10 -5 mol/L. La 3+ inhibited adipogenic differentiation except at 1×10 -10 and 1×10 -7 mol/L at the 10th day, and inhibited adipogenic differentiation except at 1×10 -9 mol/L at the 16th day. These findings suggested that La 3+ might have protective effect on bone at appropriate dose and time. This would be valuable for better understanding the mechanism of the effect of La 3+ on bone metabolism. © 2012 The Chinese Society of Rare Earths.",

Under the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy environment, we investigate a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method on the basis of some information measures. We first introduce three axiomatic definitions of information measures under interval-valued hesitant fuzzy environment, including the entropy, similarity measures and cross-entropy. Several information measure formulas for interval-valued hesitant fuzzy elements (IVHFEs) are further constructed, which is based on the continuous ordered weighted averaging (COWA) operator. Then, the relationship among the entropy, similarity measures and cross-entropy is discussed, from which we find that three information measures can be transformed by each other based on their axiomatic definitions. The programming model is established to determine optimal weight of attribute with the principle of minimum entropy and maximum cross-entropy. Furthermore, an approach to MAGDM is developed, in which the attribute values take the form of IVHFEs. Finally, a numerical example for emergency risk management (ERM) evaluation is provided to illustrate the application of the developed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lithium-rich layered materials are promising candidates for next generation Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to high energy densities, which still, however, suffer low initial Coulombic efficiency (i.e. irreversible initial capacity loss), poor rate capability and capacity retention during cycling. In this work, Li +  conductive Li 2 SnO 3  (LSO) is selected to modify the surface of Li 1.2 Mn 0.56 Ni 0.17 Co 0.07 O 2  (LMNCO) without influencing its bulk structure. Electrochemical characterizations indicate that the obtained LSO@LMNCO electrode shows greatly improved cycling stability and rate capability compared with those of the pristine LMNCO. Intensive aging experiment reveals that the LSO modification layer plays a critical role in performance enhancement, which not only stabilizes the bulk structure of LMNCO in long-term storage/cycling via suppression of metal oxide dissolution, but also benefits the surface kinetics by growth inhibition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the particle surface.",

        "abstract": "Demethylation of CD11a and CD70 regulatory regions in CD4+ T cells contributes to the development of autoreactivity and overstimulation of autoantibodies. Because growth arrest and DNA damage-induced 45alpha (GADD45alpha) reduces epigenetic silencing of genes by removing methylation marks, this study examined whether the gadd45A gene could contribute to autoimmunity by promoting DNA demethylation in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Levels of GADD45alpha, CD11a, and CD70 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting or flow cytometry. Global DNA methylation was evaluated using Methylamp global DNA methylation quantification kits. Detection of CD4+ T cell proliferation and autologous B cell IgG antibodies was performed using commercially available kits. CD11a and CD70 promoter methylation was determined with bisulfite sequencing.Elevated gadd45A mRNA expression and global DNA hypomethylation were observed in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients. The levels of gadd45A mRNA were inversely proportional to the levels of DNA methylation. Positive correlations were found between gadd45A and CD11a/CD70 mRNA levels. Expression of gadd45A mRNA was increased in CD4+ T cells following ultraviolet B irradiation, and this was accompanied by increased levels of CD11a and CD70 mRNA. Moreover, increased expression of gadd45A, CD11a, and CD70 mRNA was accompanied by increased autoreactivity and excessive B cell stimulation in gadd45A-transfected CD4+ T cells. CD11a promoter methylation was also significantly reduced in transfected cells. Transfection of gadd45A small interfering RNA inhibited the autoreactivity of SLE CD4+ T cells and led to significant increases in the methylation levels of the CD11a and CD70 promoter regions.These findings indicate that gadd45A may contribute to lupus-like autoimmunity by promoting DNA demethylation in SLE CD4+ T cells.",

The main epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA. Recent studies indicate that aberrant DNA methylation is a common feature of many human disorders, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, heart diseases, skin diseases, and others. Skin diseases comprise various diseases that have a complex etiology and pathogenesis, including genetics and acquired factors such as environment and diet. These acquired factors often have pathogenic effects through modification of DNA and histones, of which DNA methylation is the most common mechanism. Aberrant DNA methylation has been demonstrated in skin diseases, including skin tumors and autoimmune-related skin disorders. Herein, we review the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of skin diseases.",

The reaction proceeds via five sequential steps, including arene C–H activation, alkyne insertion, oxygen atom transfer (OAT), protonolysis, and C–C bond coupling. Among the five steps, protonolysis is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step. Furthermore, the effect of pivalic acid additive, solvent, and center metal of the catalyst on the diastereoselectivity and yields is investigated.

        "abstract": "In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), T lymphocytes overexpress CD70 (TNFSF7 gene), leading to the synthesis of autoreactive IgGs. CD70 upregulation in SLE CD4(+) T cells is associated with hypomethylation of TNFSF7 promoter. In this study, we explored histone modifications in the TNFSF7 promoter region in SLE CD4(+) T cells, and characterized the effects of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-azaC) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA) on CD70 expression. We found that CD70 mRNA was significantly increased in active lupus CD4(+) T cells, and in control cells treated with 5-azaC, TSA, or both. Histone H3 acetylation and dimethylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) levels were significantly elevated in patients with lupus, and both factors correlated positively with disease activity. MeCP2 protein levels within the TNFSF7 promoter decreased in patients with active lupus. Treatment of CD4+ T cells with 5-azaC alone significantly raised H3K4 dimethyl levels at the TNFSF7 locus. TSA treatment significantly increased H3 and H4 acetylation levels, as well as levels of H3K4 dimethylation at the TNFSF7 locus. Treatment with 5-azaC plus TSA enhanced H3 acetylation levels. These findings indicate that aberrant histone modifications within the TNFSF7 promoter may contribute to the development of lupus by increasing CD70 expression in CD4(+) T cells.",

Methods Clinical data of 1381 children with HFMD admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi'an Jiaotong University and Xi'an Children's Hospital from January to December 2011 were collected, retrospectively.Clinical data and laboratory data were summarized for 263 severe cases. Results HFMD cases were reported in each month, while the majority(69.6%) were reported from May to June and from August to November. 96.7% of the cases were less than 5 years old. More boys than girls were reported(male/female:1.65/1). 62.2% of the cases were human enterovirus 71(EV71) positive. Among the 1381 cases, 263(19.0%)suffered severe HFMD, 30(2.2%) suffered critical HFMD, and 3(0.2%) died. The EV71 positive rates were 76.8%, 90.0% and 100%, respectively. All the 263 cases with severe HFMD presented rash and early symptoms of encephalitis such as frequent hyperarousal, limb tremor and somnolence. Of these patients, 50(19.0%) presented convulsion and seizure, 243(92.4%) patients presented pathologic reflexes, 256(97.3%) patients presented fever, 139(52.9%) had moderate temperature(38.1-39.0 ℃), 83(31.6%) patients had high temperature(>39.0 ℃), 168(63.9%) patients had significant increased white blood cell(WBC) count, 138(52.5%) patients had significant increased blood glucose level, and 168(63.9%) patients were co-infected with respiratory virus such as influenza virus and syncytial virus. Conclusions The occurrence of HFMD was different among seasons, regions, sexes and ages in 2011 in Xi'an. Frequent hyperarousal, limb tremor,somnolence, high counts of WBC, high levels of blood glucose, and co-infection with respiratory tract viruses were the early signs of severe HFMD, and should be identified in time for early intervention.",

        "abstract": "As an important data analysis method in data mining, clustering analysis has been researched extensively and in depth. Aiming at the limitation of -means clustering algorithm that it is sensitive to the distribution of initial clustering center, Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) Algorithm is introduced to solve clustering problems. Firstly, this paper introduces the basic ideas of GSO algorithm, -means algorithm, and good-point set and analyzes the feasibility of combining them for clustering optimization. Next, it designs a clustering method of improved GSO algorithm based on good-point set which combines GSO algorithm and classical -means algorithm together, searches data object space, and provides initial clustering centers for -means algorithm by means of improved GSO algorithm and thus obtains better clustering results. Major improvement of GSO algorithm is to optimize the initial distribution of glowworm swarm by introducing the theory and method of good-point set. Finally, the new clustering algorithm is applied to UCI data sets of different categories and numbers for clustering test. The advantages of the improved clustering algorithm in terms of sum of squared errors (SSE), clustering accuracy, and robustness are explained through comparison and analysis.",

        "title": "A Targeted Multiple Antigenic Peptide Vaccine Augments the Immune Response to Self TGF-β1 and Suppresses Ongoing Hepatic Fibrosis.",
        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression is induced upon liver injury, and plays a critical role in hepatic fibrosis. Antibodies against TGF-β1 represent a novel approach in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. However, TGF-β1 is not a suitable antigen due to immunological tolerance. In the current study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) vaccine against the dominant B-cell epitope of TGF-β1. The immunogenicity and potential therapeutic effects of this vaccine were examined using a rat model of hepatic fibrosis. Dominant B-cell epitopes of TGF-β1 were identified using bioinformatic program. An MAP vaccine corresponding to the 90-98 amino acid domain of TGF-β1 and containing four dendritic arms was synthesized using a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Hepatic fibrosis which was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats received a high-fat diet and ethanol (1.8 g/kg). Starting from the third week, rats were exposed to 40 % carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; 150 μl/100 g body weight twice weekly, initially 200 μl/100 g) treatment for a duration of 8 weeks. Rats received the MAP vaccine (100 μg) or Freund's adjuvant at weeks 1, 3, 5. A group of rats receiving the fibrosis-inducing regimen alone and a group of healthy rats (receiving an olive oil vehicle alone) were included as controls. At the conclusion of the experiment, serum titre of TGF-β1 antibody was measured using ELISA and a standard liver functional test panel was examined. The extent of hepatic fibrosis was determined by measuring hydroxyproline content in the liver as well as hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and van Gieson (VG) staining. The expression of TGF-β1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was examined using immunohistochemistry, and presented as positive staining cells. The MAP purity was >90 % upon reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with apparent molecular weight at 4.77 kDa. Serum TGF-β1 antibody titre was 1:256. The fibrosis-inducing treatment produced significant liver damage, as reflected by increases in liver functional test, HE and VG staining. The MAP vaccine attenuated such damage, as reflected by decreased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and hepatic hydroxyproline (116.78 ± 23.76 vs. 282.71 ± 136.94 IU/L; 319.78 ± 82.48 vs. 495.29 ± 137.13 IU/L; 2.02 ± 0.27 vs. 4.01 ± 0.52 μmol/L; 263.67 ± 41.18 vs. 439.14 ± 43.29 μg/g vs. in model rats, respectively; p < 0.01), as well as fibrosis extent by HE and VG staining. The MAP vaccine reduced TGF-β1 and α-SMA expression in rats (0.325 ± 0.059 vs. 0.507 ± 0.044 IOD/area; 0.318 ± 0.058 vs. 0.489 ± 0.029 IOD/area vs. model rats, respectively; p < 0.05). The TGF-β1 MAP vaccine could generate sufficient antibody that suppresses the development of hepatic fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "As candidates for high-energy density cathodes, lithium-rich (Li-rich) layered materials have attracted wide interests for the next-generation Li-ion batteries. In this work, surface functionalization of a typical Li-rich material Li1.2Mn0.56Ni0.17Co0.07O2 is optimized by fluorine (F) doped Li2SnO3 coating layer, and electrochemical performances are also enhanced accordingly. The results demonstrate that F doped Li2SnO3 modified material exhibits the highest capacity retention (73% after 200 cycles), with approximately 1.2, 1.4, and 1.5 times of discharge capacity for Li2SnO3 surface-modified, F-doped and pristine electrodes, respectively. To reveal the fundamental enhancement mechanism, intensive surface Li+ diffusion kinetics, postmortem structural characteristics, and aging tests are performed for four sample systems. The results show that the coating layer plays an important role in addressing interface compatibility, instead of stabilizing the bulk structure and simultaneously suppressing side reactions, as the most decisive factor in performance controlling for the active electrodes. These findings not only pave the way to commercial application of the Li-rich material, but also shed new light on surface modification in batteries and other energy storage fields.",

In this work, a thin nanolayer of LaF 3  is applied to modify the surface of LNMO. Electrochemical and thermal tests indicate that 4 wt% LaF 3  surface modification could greatly improve the electrode performances in terms of cycling stability and rate capability as well as thermal stability of LNMO compared with the pristine electrode, without influencing the crystallographic structure of bulk material. Further analysis for understanding the intrinsic mechanism reveals that the growth of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film could be effectively suppressed by the surface LaF 3  nanolayer, which meanwhile stabilizes the bulk structure through retarding continuous TM dissolution from intensive chemical aging measurements at elevated temperature. This work, theoretically and technically, provides a promising alternative approach for enhancing electrochemical performances of high voltage LNMO cathode material.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis and etiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) are complex and poorly understood. To date, several studies have demonstrated that the activation of the immune system undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in SSc pathogenesis. Activated immune effector T cells contribute to the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and drive the SSc-specific autoantibody responses. This, and a profibrotic environment, are all-important components of abnormal active immune responses that can lead to pathological disorders of SSc. CD11a is essential to inflammatory and immune responses, regulating adhesive and co-stimulatory interactions between CD4(+) T cells and other cells. Although CD11a is overexpressed in SSc patients, the mechanisms leading to this overexpression and its consequences remain unclear. DNA methylation, a main epigenetic modification, plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. This work aims to investigate the effect of DNA demethylation on CD11a expression in SSc CD4(+) T cells and to determine its functional significance. CD11a expression was measured using RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Bisulfite sequencing was used to determine the methylation status of the CD11a regulatory region. CD4(+) T cells were co-cultured with antigen-presenting cells, B cells, or fibroblasts with and without anti-CD11a, and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells, IgG production by B cells, and expression levels of COL1A2 mRNA by fibroblasts were evaluated.Elevated CD11a expression levels were observed in CD4(+) T cells from SSc patients; these levels were found to be positively correlated with disease activity. The methylation levels of the CD11a regulatory sequences were lower in SSc patients than in controls and inversely correlated with CD11a mRNA expression. Treatment of CD4(+) T cells with 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) decreased CD11a promoter methylation and caused CD11a overexpression. SSc CD4(+) T cells and 5-azaC-treated CD4(+) T cells showed increased proliferation of CD4(+) T cells, increased production of IgG by co-cultured B cells, and induced expression of COL1A2 mRNA by co-cultured fibroblasts. These stimulatory effects were abrogated by anti-CD11a.Demethylation of CD11a regulatory elements and subsequent CD11a overexpression in CD4(+) T cells may mediate immunological abnormalities and fibrotic processes in SSc.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the clinical feature of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and the risk factors of severe cases. Methods Clinical data of 468 patients with HFMD admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi’an Jiaotong University and Xi’an Children’s Hospital from August to November 2010 were collected. The data including the patients’ age, gender, geographical distribution, clinical manifestation and laboratory examination were analyzed. Total of 30 mild cases were selected randomly and compared with 29 severe cases. Univariate and multivariate method for data analysis were carried out. Results Among of the 468 cases, male to female ratio was 1.2∶ 1, the proportion of urban and rural areas was 1.8∶ 1, and 385 (82.2%) cases were younger than 3 years old. Clinical manifestation showed that 468 (100%) cases had rash, 361 (77.1%) cases got fever and 161 cases were found tachycardia. The rates of high fever, vomiting and tachycardia were significantly different between the two groups. Logistic multiple regression analysis showed that leukocytosis, hyperglycemia and co-infection with EB virus were risk factors to severe cases.Conclusions Children younger than 3 years old are susceptible to HFMD and most severe cases happen in the countryside. The mainly clinical manifestations of HFMD are rash and fever, while high fever, vomiting, tachycardia may be used as warning indicators for early identification to severe cases. Leukocytosis, hyperglycemia and co-infection with EB are risk factors of severe cases, especially hyperglycemia, should be paid much attention to.",

Blood collection volume, adverse effects and severe complications following blood collection and transfusion were recorded. Hemoglobin (HGB), red blood cell (RBC) and hematocrit (HCT) prior to phlebotomy and on the fifth day (predeposit autologous transfusion) or second day (allgenic blood transfusion) next to blood donation were measured. Of the 28 patients, the total amount of blood autotransfused was 12 000 mL, averaged 429 mL; 2 patients (7%) passed perioperative period successfully without allogenic blood transfusion; while 26 patients (93%) received allogenic blood transfusion besides autotransfusion for a total amount of 12 800 mL, averaged 492 mL. The 16 control patients received allogenic blood transfusion for a total amount of 17 200 mL, averaged 1 075 mL. No significant difference was found between before and 5 days after transfusion in terms of red blood cell and hematocrit (P > 0.05), but hemoglobin changed significantly (P < 0.001). There were significant differences in hemoglobin among autotransfusion alone, autotransfusion and allogenic blood transfusion, and allogenic blood transfusion alone groups (P < 0.001). No dangerous autotransfusion-associated complication was found. It is simple, convenient, economic, safe and effective for predeposit autologous transfusion. It is benefit to simultaneous bilateral TKA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) has been reported to possess the hepatoprotective effect. This study was to investigate the mechanism underlying CAPE against liver fibrosis in a liver fibrosis model induced by toxic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in male Sprague-Dawley rats and  in vitro  in CAPE (5 μM, 10 μM, 15 μM) treated hepatic stellate cells (HSC-T6). We found that CAPE treatment remarkably attenuated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by blocking the activation of HSCs as determined by the expression alternation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3), collage I, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1. The hepatoprotective effects of CAPE were also associated with upregulation of autophasomes in HSCs as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) detection. The  in vitro  study further confrimed that CAPE attenuated liver fibrogenesis via inducing authophagic markers including LC3, ATG5, Beclin 1 expressions, while inhibiting AKT/mTOR signaling in HSC-T6 cells. Thus, the protective effects of CAPE against liver fibrosis might due to the inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling and induction of authophagy in HSCs.",

        "abstract": "The selection of RP-LC columns suitable for a particular analysis in official compendia is difficult as only a general description of the stationary phase in the description of a LC method is given. General methods to characterize RP-LC columns often assume that each of the column parameters is equally important. This can cause the user to select columns inappropriate for particular analyses. This paper focuses on the relationship between the critical peak pairs and the column parameters (H, S, A, B, and C) in the Snyder/Dolan column characterization methodology to find the key parameters influencing real separations. Some varieties of β-lactam antibiotics and their related compounds were used as test compounds. We found column parameter A to be the most important factor affecting their separation. Parameters B and C also played an important role in some separation processes. This indicated that the hydrogen bonding of column and solute can directly affect the separation of β-lactam antibiotics. Choosing columns for which column parameter A is near 0.1 can facilitate the ideal separations of impurities from β-lactam antibiotics. The most suitable column for any common pharmaceutical analysis could be selected easily if the key column parameters would be given in the description of the chromatographic method. For these reasons, key column parameters should be listed in the monographs of official compendia.",

Herein, we investigated the effect of DNA demethylation on T cell CD40LG expression and the production of IgG by autologous B cells in lupus. We found normal human T cells transfected with CD40LG induced autologous B cell activation and plasma cell differentiation. Both female lupus CD4+ T cells and demethylating agents treated CD4+ T cells overexpressed CD40LG mRNA. Further, lupus T cells from both genders or demethylated CD4+ T cells from healthy women overstimulated autologous B cells, and this could be reversed with anti-CD40LG Ab in only females. We demonstrated that female lupus CD4+ T cells and demethylated CD4+ T cells express high level of CD40LG and overstimulate B cells to produce IgG. This is due to DNA demethylation and thereby reactivation of the inactive X chromosome in female.",

A fabric structure model for FDTD numerical computation of the SE is constructed. The electromagnetic parameters of each region are tested according to the transmission and reflection method. The Yee’s grid discretization method of the structure model is given, and the absorption boundary and the excitation parameters are set to determine the physical model of the fabric.

        "abstract": "The intuitionistic multiplicative preference relation (IMPR) was introduced by Xia et al. [25] to deal with situations in which the decision makers (DMs) exhibit the characteristics of affirmation, negation and hesitation for the preference degrees over paired comparisons of alternatives. The IMPR can reflect the preference information of the DMs over alternatives more comprehensively than the multiplicative preference relation (MPR). In this paper, a new method for decision making is proposed to derive normalized intuitionistic multiplicative weights on the basis of the order consistent IMPR and the consistent IMPR. We first define the concepts of order consistent IMPR, consistent IMPR and normalized intuitionistic multiplicative weights, and then discuss some properties of the consistent IMPR. After that, we investigate a transformation formula to convert the normalized intuitionistic multiplicative priority weights into a consistent IMPR. An optimization model is constructed to generate the normalized intuitionistic multiplicative weights of IMPR, and the optimal deviation values obtained from the model enable us to improve the consistency of the given IMPR, such that the repaired IMPR is consistent. In the end, a numerical example is provided, and comparative analysis with Xu’s approach [26] is performed to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Three new Ca uranyl carbonates containing nitrate or chlorine have been synthesized by room temperature evaporation of solutions. The structures of each were determined and refined on the basis of F 2 for all unique data collected using an APEX CCD-based detector and Mo K α radiation. The structures of each contain uranyl tricarbonate clusters of composition [UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 ] 4− that involve a uranyl hexagonal bipyramid that shares three equatorial edges with CO 3 groups. The structure of Ca 5 [(UO 2 )(CO 3 ) 3 ] 2 (NO 3 ) 2 (H 2 O) 10 (UND-1) consists of a sheet of uranyl tricarbonate clusters that share edges and vertices with Ca φ n polyhedra (Ca:U=5:2 in the sheet). An (NO 3 ) − group is attached to the sheet by sharing an edge with a Ca φ n polyhedron. Adjacent sheets are linked by H bonding only. The structure of Ca 6 [(UO 2 )(CO 3 ) 3 ] 2 Cl 4 (H 2 O) 19 (UND-2) has a sheet of uranyl tricarbonate clusters and Ca φ n polyhedra that is similar to that found in UND-1, but adjacent sheets are linked by bonds to Ca cations and Cl anions located between the sheets. The structure of Ca 12 [(UO 2 )(CO 3 ) 3 ] 4 Cl 8 (H 2 O) 47 (UND-3) involves uranyl tricarbonate clusters that share vertices and edges with clusters containing six-member rings of Ca φ 8 polyhedra, resulting in a heteropolyhedral framework, with Cl anions and H 2 O groups located in channels through the framework.

Activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) may influence the outcomes of EV71 infection. This case-control study aimed to assess the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor (VDR) with the severity of enterovirus 71 (EV71)-associated HFMD. We selected four VDR SNPs based on linkage disequilibrium and functional prediction, and we tested them using the SNPscan multiple SNP typing method for potential association with severity of EV71-associated HFMD. We found a significant association in the case of rs11574129 (G vs. A: OR 0.3439, 95%CI 0.1778-0.6653) and rs739837 (T vs. G: OR 0.5580, 95%CI 0.3352-0.9291). Our results suggest that these two SNPs may influence the severity of EV71-associated HFMD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Herein, Ensemble docking using multiple crystal structures was considered an effective strategy in the virtual screening. The performance of 17 scoring functions obtained from different docking software was evaluated for molecular docking.  Two novel compounds B1 and A2 were identified as Wee1 inhibitors with IC values of 10.23 ± 0.505 and 8.72 ± 0.323 μM, respectively. Further cell viability assay demonstrated that the two active compounds exhibited good anticancer activities.  This provides a meaningful starting point for further structure optimization to discover more potent Wee1 inhibitors.",

Then testing two of the fabrics selected arbitrary collocation by using Shielding Effectiveness Test Box. Finally analysing the influence parameter, the following conclusions are drawn:Implying the increase of SE with increasing conductive fiber as far as 50% of silver fiber twill fabric is concerned. On the contrary, the SE of another fabric bind with silver fiber twill fabric is obviously decreased with the increase of conductive fiber content. In the case of silver fiber content is the same. The combination of different fabrics with twill fabric has a higher electromagnetic shielding effectiveness than with plain. The combination of different fabrics with knitted fabrics, the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness is higher than with woven fabrics. The topic reveals the change rule of multilayer shielding effectiveness of electromagnetic shielding fabrics, and giving an important reference value in the design and production of electromagnetic shielding clothing.",

And then, composition and evolution of those paleo-plates, and several other issues such as Mongolian arch tectonics, basement of Junggar basin, and tectonic division of Beishan area and its connection to adjiacent areas are briefly discussed. Some new ideas are put forwards, which include that the Inner Mongolian geological axis should be a composite orogenic belt, that the Mongol-Okhotsk orogenic belt is not a suture between paleoplates, that there was a Great North China continent in the Late Paleozoic, and that precursors, paleo-oceans include the Paleo-Pacific ocean which occurred following the super-continental disintegration in the Early Meso-Proterozoic and the Paleo-Asian ocean opened in the Late Neoproterozoic.",

It was found that noise can contribute to phenomenon of implicit or explicit internal stochastic resonance (IISR or EISR), and that distance to bifurcation point was a key factor for controlling IISR or EISR. Then an external signal was added to the system, the result shows that IISR or EISR can not occur, implying an external signal destroys the cooperation of internal signal and noise. Furthermore, the difference and the similarity were discussed between IISR and EISR.",

It has been a hot-debated issue on the ancient subduction polarity of the zone as well as whether it's a suturing belt among different ancient plates. Based on our investigation and indoor research of previous literatures during the past 20 years, this paper has briefly stated major geological features of the belt and its adjacent region, and put forward to some new points that the ocean, precursor of the belt, with remark of Karamaili ophiolite belt was a back-arc basin, that the region south of the belt was part of passive margin of the basin, and that the oceanic lithospheric plate was subducted northwards in the period of closure of the basin. Finally, the constraints of the belt on the distortion of ancient tectonic as well as metallogenic framework of the East Junggar region and the reconstruction of Paleozoic ocean-continent framework of the Central Asian region are briefly discussed.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the hepatoprotective effects and antioxidant activity of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) in rats with liver fibrosis.A total of 75 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to seven experimental groups: a normal group (n = 10), a vehicle group (n = 10), a model group (n = 15), a vitamin E group (n = 10), and three CAPE groups (CAPE 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg, n = 10, respectively). Liver fibrosis was induced in rats by injecting CCl4 subcutaneously, feeding with high fat forage, and administering 30% alcohol orally for 10 wk. Concurrently, CAPE (3, 6 and 12 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered daily for 10 wk. After that, serum total bilirubin (TBil), aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were measured to assess hepatotoxicity. To investigate antioxidant activity of CAPE, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in liver tissue were determined. Moreover, the effect of CAPE on α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a characteristic hallmark of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor for antioxidant systems, was investigated by immunohistochemistry.Compared to the model group, intraperitoneal administration of CAPE decreased TBil, ALT, and AST levels in liver fibrosis rats (P < 0.05), while serum TBil was decreased by CAPE in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the liver hydroxyproline contents in both the 6 and 12 mg/kg CAPE groups were markedly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). CAPE markedly decreased MDA levels and, in turn, increased GSH levels, as well as CAT and SOD activities in liver fibrosis rats compared to the model group (P < 0.05). Moreover, CAPE effectively inhibited α-SMA expression while increasing Nrf2 expression compared to the model group (P < 0.01).The protective effects of CAPE against liver fibrosis may be due to its ability to suppress the activation of HSCs by inhibiting oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThe three-dimensional arrangement structure of the conductive fiber is an important factor of the shielding effectiveness of the electromagnetic shielding fabric (EMSF). However, until now, the three-dimensional arrangement structure has not been described because of the complex structure, which leads to many difficulties for the subsequent analysis of the electromagnetic characteristics. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a feature extraction method to describe the arrangement structure of the conductive fiber based on the three-dimensional calibration and image processing technology, providing a new idea for the above problem.Design/methodology/approachFirst, the three-dimensional positions of the conductive fibers in the EMSF are calibrated using the VHX-600 3D digital microscope and the MATLAB7.5 software. The arrangement characteristics of the conductive fibers are analyzed, and equivalent twist, cross-sectional content, and average angle of a single fiber are proposed to describe the arrangement characteristic of the conductive fiber. Then, a digital description model of the conductive fiber is constructed according to the feature parameters and its three-dimensional structures are reproduced using CATIA. Finally, the reliability of the model is verified by an FDTD example, and the significance and application of the model are given.FindingsThe proposed method can provide the feature extraction and description for the complex spatial three-dimensional arrangement structure of conductive fibers. The feature parameters can reflect different micro arrangement features of the conductive fiber. The proposed idea and method can provide a solid foundation for subsequent studies of the electromagnetic properties of the EMSF.Originality/valueThe study in this paper is of great significance and academic value. This paper provides a new three-dimensional calibration method and constructs multiple feature parameters to describe the complex three-dimensional arrangement structure, providing a new effective method to overcome the problem of the conductive fiber description. The proposed method provides an important basis for the shielding mechanism, transmission characteristics, electromagnetic calculation and product design, and woven technology of the EMSF.",

        "abstract": "The crystal structure of bijvoetite-(Y), ( M83+(H2O)25(UO2)16O8(OH)8(CO3)16)(H2O)14, M = (Y, REE), pseudo-orthorhombic, monoclinic, a 21.234(3), b 12.958(2), c 44.911(6) Å, b 90.00(2)°, V 12,357(6) Å 3, space group B1211, Z = 4, was solved by direct methods and refined by least-squares techniques to an agreement index ( R) of 8.4% and a goodness of fit (S) of 0.81 for 6622 unique observed (|Fo| > 4sF) reflections collected for a twinned crystal using graphite-monochromatic Mo Ka X-radiation and a CCD area detector. There are 16 symmetrically independent U6+ positions, each of which is part of near-linear (U 6+O2)2+ uranyl ion. Eight uranyl ions are coordinated by three O 2- and two (OH)- anions each, resulting in uranyl pentagonal bipyramids, and eight uranyl ions are coordinated by six O 2- anions each, forming uranyl hexagonal bipyramids. The structure contains 16 unique carbonate groups and eight unique M3+ sites that are occupied by variable amounts of Y, Dy and other REEs. The structure of bijvoetite-(Y) is based on a novel uranyl carbonate chain that is parallel to (100), involving edge-sharing dimers of uranyl pe n- tagonal bipyramids, edge-sharing dimers of uranyl hexagonal bipyramids, and carbonate groups. The chains are cross-linked by irregular M3+fn (f: unspecified ligand) polyhedra, forming (Y, REE)-bearing uranyl carbonate sheets that are parallel to (010). The sheet in bijvoetite-(Y) is based upon a new sheet anion-topology. There are 39 symmetrically unique H 2O groups in the structure, 25 of which are bonded to M3+ and 14 of which are located in the interlayer, where they are held in place by H bonds. The interlayer of the structure contains only H 2O groups, and adjacent sheets are connected by H bonds only. The discovery of the structure may have implications for nuclear waste disposal because uranyl carbonates may be abundant in a geological repository due to the corrosion of uranium oxide nuclear fuel. It is proposed that the structure may incorporate transuranium elements.",

To explore this inhibitory mechanism, 86 FIXa inhibitors were selected to generate pharmacophore models and subsequently SAR models. Both best pharmacophore model and ROC curve were built through the Receptor-Ligand Pharmacophore Generation module. CoMFA model based on molecular docking and PLS factor analysis methods were developed. Model propagations values are q = 0.709, r = 0.949, and r = 0.905. The satisfactory q value of 0.609, r value of 0.962, and r value of 0.819 for CoMSIA indicated that the CoMFA and CoMSIA models are both available to predict the inhibitory activity on FIXa. On the basis of pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and 3D-QSAR modeling screening, six molecules are screened as potential FIXa inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of DNA hypomethylation on mRNA and protein expression of perforin promotor in T cells. Methods: T cells were isolated from the peripheral venous blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation. CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were isolated using Miltenyi beads and protocols provided by the manufacturer. Where indicated the T cells were stimulated with PHA for 24 h, then treated with 5-azaC for an additional 72 h. Genomic DNA, mRNA, and protein were isolated from untreated and 5-azaC-treated T cells. Purified DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite, the desired sequences were amplified in sequential fragments using nested PCR. The amplified fragments were cloned into bacteria DH5α, and 5 independent clones for each of the amplified fragments were sequenced. The expression of perforin was determined using real time RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: The perforin mRNA and protein in the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets treated with 5-azaC were significantly higher than those in the untreated subsets (P < 0.05). The results of bisulfite genomic sequencing showed that the methylation of perforin promotor was significantly reduced in the treated cells compared with the untreated cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The mRNA and protein expression of perforin significantly increases in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells treated with 5-azaC, which is associated with DNA hypomethylation of perforin promoter in T cells.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We report the synthesis and photoluminescence (PL) behavior of a new molecular system, which is composed of three positional isomers. They exhibit isomeric effects on both aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanisms. Furthermore, one of them,  i.e. , (E)-5-methoxy-2-(((6-methylbenzo [d]thiazol-2- yl)imino)methyl)phenol (MTP3), shows unique mechanochromic fluorescence (MCF) phenomenon. Unlike most MCF materials that would function immediately after applying mechanical force, the MCF character of this material is however recessive with mechanical force, but becomes visible upon fumigation treatment. Given that the MCF is activated under specific conditions, it is termed as conditional mechanochromic fluorescence (CMCF) in this study. In light of the CMCF property of MTP3, a new data encryption-decryption technique was developed. Binary data and complex patterns can be recorded by mechanical force and concealed on the tailor-made data storage. The encoded data cannot be read unless it is fumed by organic vapour, demonstrating a successful encryption-decryption technique. The CMCF offers great potential to be the alternative to encryption algorithms and may contribute greatly to data security and cybercrime prevention.",

        "abstract": "Display Omitted The new concepts of order consistency and additive consistency of LPRs are introduced.The characterization about additive consistent LPRs is discussed.Two new automatic iterative algorithms are proposed.The convergences of algorithms are shown.A numerical example is provided. The linguistic preference relation (LPR) is introduced to efficiently deal with situations in which the decision makers (DMs) provide their preference information by using linguistic labels over paired comparisons of alternatives. However, the lack of consistency in decision making with LPRs can lead to inconsistent conclusions. In this paper, two new decision making methods are developed to improve the additive consistency of LPRs until they are acceptable, and eventually obtain the reliable decision making results. First, the new concepts of order consistency and additive consistency of LPRs are introduced, and followed by a discussion of the characterization about additive consistent LPRs. Then, a consistency index is defined to measure whether an LPR is of acceptable additive consistency. For an unacceptable additive consistent LPR, two automatic iterative algorithms are further proposed to help DMs improve additive consistency level until it is acceptable. In addition, the proposed algorithms can derive the priority weight vector from LPRs and obtain the ranking of the alternatives. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to an emergency operating center (EOC) selection problem. The comparative analysis demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Cathode material LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) for lithium-ion batteries is successfully synthesized by a sol–gel method and is further modified by a thin layer of YPO4 (1, 3, and 5 wt %) through a simple wet chemical strategy. Physical characterizations indicate that the YPO4 nanolayer has a little impact on the cathode structure. Electrochemical optimization reveals that the 3 wt % YPO4-coated LNMO could still deliver a high specific capacity of 107 mAh g–1 after 240 cycles, with a capacity retention of 77.5%, much higher than that of the pristine electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis proves that the rapid increase of surface impedance could be suppressed by the YPO4 coating layer and thus facilitates the surface kinetics behavior in repeated cycling. Through further material aging experiments, the improvement of electrochemical performances could be attributed to the formation of Lewis acid YF3, converted from the YPO4 coating layer in the LiPF6-based electrolyte, which not only scav...",

        "abstract": "The aberrant activity of CD4(+) T cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with DNA hypomethylation of the regulatory regions in CD11a and CD70 genes. Our previous studies demonstrated that Gadd45a contributes to the development of SLE by promoting DNA demethylation in CD4(+) T cells. In this study, we identified proteins that bind to Gadd45a in CD4(+) T cells during SLE flare by using the method of co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is one of identified proteins. Furthermore, gene and protein expression of HMGB1 was significantly increased in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared to controls, and HMGB1 mRNA was correlated with CD11a and CD70 mRNA. A significant, positive correlation was found between HMGB1 mRNA and SLEDAI for SLE patients. Our data demonstrate that HMGB1 binds to Gadd45a and may be involved in DNA demethylation in CD4(+) T cells during lupus flare.",

        "abstract": "Located in Central Asia and extending in an E-W direction, the Tianshan Mountains are composed of arcuate mountain systems convex southwestward and large basins between them in Central Asian countries, NW- and NE-trending mountain systems and basins with nearly E-W-strike long axes between them in China and low mountains and gobies in southwestern Mongolia. The mountains are nearly 4000 km long from east to west and >150 km wide from north to south. They are mostly separated from the basins on either side by thrusts and the basement of the basins is underthrust beneath the Tianshan Mountains. The crust consists predominantly of fragments of pre-Sinian continents, Paleozoic continental-margin rock series and oceanic lithospheric slices. The crust of the mountains and adjacent areas may be divided into 15 tectonic units. Roughly with the longitude 90°E as the boundary, in the region west of the boundary the South Tianshan collision zone in the south is an arcuate tectonic zone convex southward and the cratonic fragments and the collision zone between them in the north are an echelon in a NW direction, forming a huge brush structure ; in the region east of the boundary there occur the nearly E-W-trending active paleo-continental margins or island arcs and collision zones between them which are arranged alternately. The Tianshan Mountains formed after the closing of the Late Paleozoic oceanic basin and the geomorphological features of the present mountains are the production of Late Cenozoic crustal movement. The geological evolution after the formation of the Tianshan Mountains may fall into the stage of terminal Carboniferous-initial Permian syncollisional-postcollisional tectonomagmatism, stage of Early-Mid Permian mande-derived magmatism and crust-mantle interaction and stage of intracontinental since the Late Permian.",

The degree of histone H3 acetylation correlated negatively with increased disease activity in lupus patients as measured by SLEDAI (r = -0.889, p = 0.044). We found global histone H3K9 hypomethylation in both active and inactive lupus CD4+ T cells, compared with controls (p = 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). However, global levels of H3K4 methylation were not different between patients and controls. SIRT1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in active lupus CD4+ T cells compared with controls (p < 0.001), while mRNA levels of CREBBP, P300, HDAC2, HDAC7, SUV39H2, and EZH2 were significantly downregulated in patients with active lupus (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.01, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively).Histone modifications appear abnormal in CD4+ T cells in SLE.",

It uses a conductive principle to shield low-frequency electromagnetic waves of high intensity, reducing the damage to human body. Point to point resistance is an important index for evaluating the performance of electromagnetic shielding clothing. At present, the variational laws of high voltage electromagnetic shielding clothesu0027 resistance havenu0027t yet been clear and the design, manufacture and testing are all in the absence of theoretical guidance. We selected the high voltage electromagnetic shielding in line with national standards, using U610Eu0027s digital multimeter and homemade special electrode and other equipment to build a test platform. We selected representative points from major latitude lines of clothing and the parts that contacting electrified equipment when wearing clothes, and then measured the resistance value between different points. Based on longitudinal analysis and comparison of the measured values, we found that: (1) between the two piece of clothing, the greater the distance the smaller the resistance value; (2) the resistance value of the points that frequently contact with electrified equipment is significantly smaller than other resistance value of points to feet; (3) given the same distance, if there is structure line in the middle, the resistance value is large; (4) Overall clothing, structural complexity is positively associated with resistance value. It is concluded that the point to point resistance of high voltage electromagnetic shielding garment is related to the parts of clothing in contact with electrified equipment during the operation, the complexity of structure and other relevant factors. In the design and production, we should focus on reducing the resistance value between the most distal of clothing, the parts of contacting electrification equipment and the feet, increasing its connectivity; try to simplify the structure of clothing.",

The article uses DR-SO4 window method shielding effectiveness tester to test the three electromagnetic shielding fabric in 1 GHz ∼ 18 GHz wide frequency band about the shielding effectiveness. Through the analysis of the data of Origin 8.0 software, it shows that there are three kinds of electromagnetic shielding fabric shielding effectiveness appear peak in 2 GHz ∼ 6 GHz wide frequency band; Low frequency and high frequency shielding effectiveness varies greatly and the shielding efficiency is lower. the shielding effectiveness of intermediate frequency is relatively stable; In the wide frequency band, the change trend of shielding effectiveness is increased and then decrease on the whole. The stainless steel fiber type fabricu0027s shielding effectiveness appear two obvious peaks which appear in different frequency with the peaks of silver plated fiber functional fabric, copper-nickel duplicate coating fabric; The shielding effectiveness of stainless steel fiber blended fabric is stable after 8 GHz and the other two have obvious fluctuation, which has a guiding significance on the design and production of electromagnetic shielding fabric. This research can provide a reference for the design of electromagnetic shielding fabric in a wide frequency band.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely associated with insulin resistance (IS), acting primarily by interfering with insulin signaling pathways, increasing cytokine-mediated (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6) inflammatory responses and enhancing oxidative stress. In the insulin signaling pathways, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is one of the key regulatory factors. The present study constructed gene regulatory sub‑networks specific for IRS1 and IRS2 in Huh7 cells and HCV‑infected Huh7 (HCV‑Huh7) cells using linear programming and a decomposition algorithm, and investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the function of IRS1/2 in HCV‑induced IS in Huh7 cells. All data were obtained from GSE20948 of the Gene Expression Omnibus database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Genes which were significantly differentially expressed between Huh7 and HCV‑Huh7 cells were analyzed using the significance analysis of microarray algorithm. The top 50 genes, including IRS1/2, were used as target genes to determine the gene regulatory networks and next the sub‑networks of IRS1 and IRS2 in HCV‑Huh7 and Huh7 cells using Gene Regulatory Network Inference Tool, an algorithm based on linear programming and the decomposition process. The IRS1/2 sub‑networks were divided into upstream/downstream groups and activation/suppression clusters, and were further analyzed using Molecule Annotation System 3.0 and Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery software, two online platforms for enrichment and clustering analysis and visualization. The results indicated that in Huh7 cells, the downstream network of IRS2 is more complex than that of IRS1, indicating that the insulin metabolism in Huh7 cells may be primarily mediated by IRS2. In HCV‑Huh7 cells, the downstream pathway of IRS2 is blocked, suggesting that this may be the underlying mechanism in HCV infection that leads to insulin resistance. The present findings add a further dimension to the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of HCV infection-associated insulin resistance, and provide novel concepts for insulin resistance and glucose metabolism research.

Nickel–iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) with specific interlayer anions (i.e. phosphate, phosphite, and hypophosphite) were fabricated by a co-precipitation method and investigated as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Intercalation of the phosphorus oxoanion enhanced the OER activity in an alkaline solution; the optimal performance (i.e., a low onset potential of 215 mV, a small Tafel slope of 37.7 mV/dec, and stable electrochemical behavior) was achieved with the hypophosphite-intercalated NiFe-LDH catalyst, demonstrating dramatic enhancement over the traditional carbonate-intercalated NiFe-LDH in terms of activity and durability. This enhanced performance is attributed to the interaction between the intercalated phosphorous oxoanions and the edge-sharing MO6 (M = Ni, Fe) layers, which modifies the surface electronic structure of the Ni sites. This concept should be inspiring for the design of more effective LDH-based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.",

Also, the susceptibility risk (OR=1.701, 95%CI: 1.142-2.535) and severity risk (OR=1.852, 95%CI: 1.038-3.305) of TLR7 rs179010 allele T significantly increased in the male children with EV71 HFMD. But there was no significant difference in the distribution of TLR7 rs179010 and rs3853839 genes between female children with EV71 HFMD and female controls. There was no correlation between the genetic polymorphisms of MyD88 rs7744 and the susceptibility to and severity of EV71 HFMD in the children. Conclusion Polymorphisms of TLR7 rs3853839 and rs179010 are correlated to the susceptibility to and severity of EV71 HFMD in male children.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we report the synthesis and photoluminescence (PL) properties of a new luminogen, (E)-4-(((2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)methylene)amino)benzoic acid (HNMA), which undergoes both aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) mechanisms. The crystalline powder emits intense green fluorescence under UV illumination, whereas after grinding, the emission decreases dramatically with a red-shift in the emission wavelength. The changes in its fluorescence are due to crystalline–amorphous transition as confirmed by XRD analysis and the microscopic technique. Furthermore, the emission of the amorphous phase can be readily converted back into its original state by a recrystallization process, which can be realized by either immersion or fumigation in common organic solvents. Importantly, the switching between two states can be repeated for over 25 cycles without fatigue. Based on indefatigability intrinsic to mechanochromic luminogens, a new strategy to realize rewritable optical data storage is developed. “0” and “1” states of the binary data, corresponding to the two emission states, can be encoded on a substrate by mechanical force and erased by fumigation treatment, demonstrating good repeatability and potential for bulk storage.",

The morphologies and structures of the as-prepared samples are studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometric (EDS) analyses and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that a desirable capacity retention of 95.5% could be obtained for 2 wt% ZrF 4 -surface modified LNMO after 120 cycles, much greater than that of 80.1% for the pure material. Meanwhile, 2 wt% ZrF 4  modified sample shows superior rate performance, which delivers a high capacity of 106 mAh g −1  at 2C. Intensive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses indicate that ZrF 4  surface modification is effective in stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface at high voltage, through averting the direct contact and depressing the undesirable side reactions between cathode and electrolyte. The ZrF 4  surface modification on LNMO proposed herein, with a facile and repeatable strategy, provides a perspective in enhancing surface structural stability as well as electrochemical reversibility for electrode functionalization.",

        "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease with a predilection for women. The interaction between CD40 and CD154 (CD40L) is known to be involved in the development of SSc. Although CD40L is overexpressed in patients with SSc, the mechanisms leading to this overexpression are not well understood. We previously demonstrated that DNA demethylation reactivates the silent X chromosome, resulting in CD40L overexpression in healthy women. We hypothesized that CD40L up-regulation by DNA demethylation and subsequent reactivation of the silent X chromosome in female patients with SSc explain the susceptibility of women to SSc. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DNA demethylation on CD40L expression in CD4+ T cells from female patients with SSc.CD40L expression in CD4+ T cells from patients with SSc and healthy control subjects was measured by flow cytometry and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Bisulfite sequencing was performed to determine the methylation status of the CD40L regulatory region.CD40L expression was significantly elevated in female patients with SSc. The methylation levels of the DNA regulatory sequences were reduced in female patients with SSc compared with healthy women, and there was a significant inverse correlation between the average methylation level and CD40L mRNA expression in female patients with SSc. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the expression of CD40L between male patients with SSc and male control subjects. The DNA regulatory regions in both male patients and male control subjects were largely unmethylated.Demethylation of CD40L regulatory elements on the inactive X chromosome contributes to CD40L overexpression in CD4+ T cells from female patients with SSc.",

        "abstract": "Climate, vegetation and land use changes in a watershed play a decisive role in the river′s ecological water demand. In this study, we calculated the river′s current ecological water demand taking Tuhai River upstream above Liuqiaozha Station as an example. The river′s ecological water demand was predicted under different hydrological frequency years and ecological restoration plans, using the distributed hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). The results showed that current river′s ecological water demand was 81.09×106m3, of which self-purification water demand was a major part. Therefore, the key to ensure the ecological water demand was to decrease point source pollution, the irrigation water quantity and chemical pesticide and fertilizer usage, while increasing the width of buffer zone along the river. Through the implementation of different management measures, the sources of pollution will be controlled. As a result of the pollution control, the river′s ecologic water demand in the year 2015, 2020 and 2030 is predicted in a declining trend. The ecological water demand in rich precipitation years is satisfied by the natural river flow. In the dry years, it is necessary to supply water to the river, due to a serious shortage of ecological water.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Dendrite growth and safety issues in a liquid electrolyte seriously hinder the development of Li metal batteries. Hierarchical nanoporous γ-Al 2 O 3  is synthesized through a hydrothermal method, followed by sufficient encapsulation of a typical organic liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF 6  in EC:DMC). Thus obtained quasi solid electrolyte (QSE) displays combined advantages of the rigid inorganic framework (from solid γ-Al 2 O 3 ) and high ionic conductivity (from liquid organic electrolyte). Specifically, the QSE affords a conductivity of 1.1 × 10 −3  S cm −1  at room temperature and behaves a fine lithium ion transference number of 0.62. Inheriting the merits of solid framework, it also exhibits remarkable thermal/mechanical stabilities and a broad electrochemical window up to 5.0 V (vs. Li + /Li). The assembled LiFePO 4  (LFP)/QSE/Li cell delivers a high specific capacity of 136.8 mAh g −1  after 50 cycles, with capacity retention of 96.5% at room temperature, which is mainly attributed to the high ionic conductivity and remarkably suppressed Li dendrite growth by the QSE. This work extends the application of hierarchical nanoporous structure and enables a safe, efficient operation of Li anode in next generation energy storage systems.",

        "abstract": "Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an efficient way to generate hydrogen fuel for the storage of renewable energy. Currently, the widely used Pt-based catalysts suffer from high costs and limited electrochemical stability; therefore, developing an efficient alternative catalyst is very urgent. Herein, one pot hydrothermal synthesis is reported of amorphous ruthenium-sulfide (RuS ) nanoparticles (NPs) supported on sulfur-doped graphene oxide (GO). The as-obtained composite serves as a Pt-like HER electrocatalyst. Achieving a current density of -10 mA cm only requires a small overpotential (-31, -46, and -58 mV in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolyte, respectively) with high durability. The isolated Ru active site inducing Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism in the RuS NPs is demonstrated by the Tafel analysis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterization. Theoretical simulation indicates the isolated Ru site exhibits Pt-like Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (-0.21 eV) therefore generating high intrinsic HER activity. Moreover, the strong bonding between the RuS and S-GO, as well as pH tolerance of RuS are believed to contribute to the high stability. This work shows a new insight for amorphous materials and provides alternative opportunities in designing advanced electrocatalysts with low-cost for HER in the hydrogen economy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, we synthesized a class of positional isomers by attaching a carboxylic group in different sites (para-, meta- and ortho-position) of an aromatic core. The isomers undergo both aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanisms, as proved by their photoluminescence (PL) behaviour. Changing the position of the carboxylic group will adjust the dipole–dipole direction, which further controls the self-assembled architecture: The morphology undergoes a transition from 1D nanowire to 2D microsheet, and even to 3D microcube. The benzoic acid moiety of the AIE isomers has strong affinity to amines, and adsorbing amines leads to spectral changes including hypochromatic shift and emission quenching. The sensing mechanism was studied by density functional theory (DFT), which reveals that the amine-responsive fluorescence can be ascribed to the weakened ICT effect. A prototype of amine sensor based on m-DB self-assemblies was developed accordingly, showing a remarkable quenching efficiency as high as 85.4%. A linear relation was obtained from the quantitative determination of amine, offering a low detection limit of 2.02 Pa. It can also respond to other organic amines such as diisopropylamine (DIPA), triethylamine (TEA), isopropylamine (IPA) and cyclohexylamine (CHA). Finally, the practicality of the sensor was also demonstrated: When placing the sensing film beside the spoiled meat, the spectrum shows a remarkable fluorescence quenching; in contrast, fresh meat samples have induced a much lower quenching efficiency. This demonstrates that the AIE isomers have a great potential to serve as indicators for meat spoilage.",

A series of IDO1 potential inhibitors were identified by a combination of following steps: Lipinski's Rule of Five, Veber rules filter, molecular docking, HipHop pharmacophores, 3D-Quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies and Pan-assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) filter. Three known categories of IDO1 inhibitors were used to constructed pharmacophores and 3D-QSAR models. Four point pharmacophores (RHDA) of IDO1 inhibitors were generated from the training set. The 3D-QSAR models were obtained using partial least squares (PLS) analyze based on the docking conformation alignment from the training set. The leave-one-out correlation (q) and non-cross-validated correlation coefficient (r) of the best CoMFA model were 0.601 and 0.546, and the ones from the best CoMSIA model were 0.506 and 0.541, respectively. Six hits from Specs database were identified and analyzed to confirm their binding modes and key interactions to the amino acid residues in the protein. This work may provide novel backbones for new generation of inhibitors of IDO1.",

This paper yields an apparent 206Pb/238U age of (311±9) Ma by SHRIMP U-Pb dating of zircons from the gneissoid-biotitic granite. According to the characteristics of the pluton and related zircon’s mineralogy, this age is explained as the intrusion age of gneissoid-biotitic granite. Available chronological data, we infer that the gneissoid-biotitic granite formed in the extensional setting of back-arc, and the formation of gneissic structure has related to the extension of back-arc. And the lower age of metamorphism nearby Xiaopu is (311±9) Ma.",

Cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry (FACS). Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA and protein expression was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. TGF-β1, TNF-α, and VEGF contents were determined by ELISA.Guggulsterone significantly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. FACS showed that guggulsterone arrested HepG2 cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. Guggulsterone induced apoptosis was also observed in HepG2 cells, with 24.91% ± 2.41% and 53.03% ± 2.28% of apoptotic cells in response to the treatment with 50 μmol/L and 75 μmol/L guggulsterone, respectively. Bax mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased and Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression was decreased. ELISA analysis showed that the concentrations of TGF-β1 and VEGF were significantly decreased and TNF-α concentration was increased.Guggulsterone exerts its anticancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Guggulsterone induces apoptosis by activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.",

Also, microstructure and microhardness were analyzed and distribution of strain during rolling was discussed. It shows that under this condition, when reduction rate Δh/h0 is less than 58.9%, the spread changes markedly, which is expressed by linear relation with reduction ratio increases, and the spread changes slowly when there is a severe deformation. Moreover, the changes of microstructure and microhardness become homogeneous with reduction increases, indicating deformation tends towards uniformity gradually.",

        "abstract": "As a new preference structure, the intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic preference relation (IFLPR) was introduced to efficiently cope with situations in which the membership degree and non-membership degree are represented as linguistic terms. For group decision making (GDM) problems with IFLPRs, two significant and challenging issues are individual consistency and group consensus before deriving the reliable priority weights of alternatives. In this paper, a novel decision support model is investigated to simultaneously deal with the individual consistency and group consensus for GDM with IFLPRs. First, the concepts of multiplicative consistency and weak transitivity for IFLPRs are introduced and followed by a discussion of their desirable properties. Then, a transformation approach is developed to convert the normalized intuitionistic fuzzy priority weights into multiplicative consistent IFLPR. Based on the distance of IFLPRs, the consistency index, individual consensus degree and group consensus degree for IFLPRs are further defined. In addition, two convergent automatic iterative algorithms are proposed in the investigated decision support model. The first algorithm is utilized to convert an unacceptable multiplicative consistent IFLPR to an acceptable one. The second algorithm can assist the group decision makers to achieve a predefined consensus level. The main characteristic of the investigated decision support model is that it guarantees each IFLPR is still acceptable multiplicative consistent when the predefined consensus level is achieved. Finally, several numerical examples are provided, and comparative analyses with existing approaches are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the investigated model.",

Monotherapy and double therapy seemed to show no effect in naive patients. Triple therapy followed with PegIFN-2a plus ribavirin seemed to be effective in both naive patients and previously failed treated patients. Telaprevir was associated with a significantly higher incidence of serious adverse events (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.00-2.10) and with discontinuation (RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.40-3.55) because of adverse events. In naive patients, relapsers and non-responders, the regimen of telaprevir/ PegIFN-2a/ribavirin for 12 weeks followed by PegIFN-2a/ribavirin for 12 weeks (T12PR24) was the optimal regimen regarding to efficiency and duration.Telaprevir combined with PegIFN-2a plus ribavirin may improve sustained response in genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. Regimen T12PR24 may be the best regimen in this respect. New randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this meta-analysis.",

        "abstract": "In southern Altay Mountains, some NW-SE striking small linear granite plutons are exposed, which were intruded into Devonian and Early Carboniferous volcano-sedimentary sequences that had undergone intense sinistral ductile shearing. Structural deformation of these granites implies that their intrusion occurred simultaneously with shearing deformation. This paper describes SHRIMP dating data of zircons from two of these granites, namely the southern Altay biotite granite body and the southern Shaerbulake two-mica granite body. Zircons form the southern Shaerbulake intrusive body yield an apparent 206Pb/238U age of (275.1±1.7) Ma, which is interpreted as the intrusive age of the granite pluton, as evidenced by geological, petrological and deformational characteristics of the granite plutons and related zircon CL images. Based on the new dating data, the authors infer that the sinistral ductile shear deformation of Erqis faulted zone and southern Altay Mountains probably occurred posterior to 275 Ma. In combination with available data, this paper deals briefly with the Permian tectonic evolution in southern Altay Mountains.",

        "abstract": "Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of urate crystals within joints. It is increasingly in prevalence during the past few decades as shown by the epidemiological survey results. Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a key enzyme to transfer hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid, whose overproduction leads to gout. Therefore, inhibiting the activity of xanthine oxidase is an important way to reduce the production of urate. In the study, in order to identify the potential natural products targeting XO, pharmacophore modeling was employed to filter databases. Here, two methods, pharmacophore based on ligand and pharmacophore based on receptor-ligand, were constructed by Discovery Studio. Then GOLD was used to refine the potential compounds with higher fitness scores. Finally, molecular docking and dynamics simulations were employed to analyze the interactions between compounds and protein. The best hypothesis was set as a 3D query to screen database, returning 785 and 297 compounds respectively. A merged set of the above 1082 molecules was subjected to molecular docking, which returned 144 hits with high-fitness scores. These molecules were clustered in four main kinds depending on different backbones. What is more, molecular docking showed that the representative compounds established key interactions with the amino acid residues in the protein, and the RMSD and RMSF of molecular dynamics results showed that these compounds can stabilize the protein. The information represented in the study confirmed previous reports. And it may assist to discover and design new backbones as potential XO inhibitors based on natural products.",

        "abstract": "The reaction mechanisms on the NHC-catalyzed [4 + 3] and [4 + 1] annulations of enals with azoalkenes have been theoretically investigated with the aid of the density functional theory calculations. It is found that the additives play an important role in promoting proton transfer and dehydration. The impacts of catalysts (NHC-A and NHC-B) and substituent groups on the regioselectivity were rationalized. The origin of the regioselectivity involved in these reactions was probed by performing distortion–interaction analysis. For reaction A with NHC-A as the catalyst and Boc group as the substituent, the regioselectivity is predicted to be determined by the interaction energy of 3 with R2′ in TS3A versus TS8A. For reaction B with NHC-B as the catalyst and Boc group as the substituent, the unstable boat-type conformation versus the stable chair-type conformation involved in the NHC-B moiety accounts for the regioselectivity. In reaction C with NHC-A as the catalyst and Ts group as the substituent, distortion ...",

SSd group received 0.03% (w/v) SSd in saline. Liver samples were analysed immunohistochemically for syndecan-2, MMP-2, MMP-13 and TIMP-2 at 16 weeks.The model group had more malignant nodules than the SSd group; all model-group HCC cells were grade III; SSd-group HCC cells were grades I-II. Controls showed normal hepatic cell phenotypes and no syndecan-2+ staining. Syndecan-2+ staining was greater in the model group (35.2%, P < or = 0.001) than in controls or the SSd group (16.5%, P < or = 0.001). The model group had more intense MMP-2+ staining than controls (0.37 vs 0.27, P< or =0.01) or the SSd group (0.31 vs 0.37, P< or =0.05); and higher MMP-13+ staining (72.55%) than in controls (12.55%, P< or =0.001) and SSd group (20.18%, P< or =0.01).

        "abstract": "Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which leads to significant mortality in infected children. A prophylactic vaccine is urgently needed. However, little is known about the protective T-cell immunity in individuals infected with the EV71 virus. In this study, we performed a comprehensive ex vivo interferon-γ ELISPOT analysis in 31 children infected with EV71 as well as in 40 healthy adult controls of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses to overlapping peptides spanning the VP1 structural protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) non-structural protein. EV71-specific CD4 T-cell responses were detected in most of the acute patients and were mostly CD4-dependent RdRp-specific responses. CD8-dependent VP1 and RdRp-specific responses were also detected in a small proportion of recently infected children. There was no significant association between the strength of the T-cell responses and disease severity observed during the acute EV71 infection phase. Interestingly, an RdRp-specific, but no VP1-specific, CD4-dependent T-cell response was detected in 30% of the adult controls, and no T-cell responses were detected in healthy children. In addition, 24 individual peptides containing potential T-cell epitope regions were identified. The data suggest that CD4-dependent RdRp-specific T-cell responses may play an important role in protective immunity, and the epitopes identified in this study should provide valuable information for future therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine design as well as basic research.",

        "abstract": "A series of experimental methods including 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test,alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity measurement,oil red O stain and measurement,mineralized function and quantitive real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were employed to assess the effects of Er3+ on the proliferation,differentiation and mineralization function of primary osteoblasts (OBs) in vitro at cell and molecular levels. The results indicated that Er3+ inhibited the proliferation of OBs at a concentration of 1×10–7 mol/L,but had no effect at other concentrations. Er3+ inhibited the differentiation of OBs at concentrations of 1×10–8,1×10–7,and 1×10–6 mol/L,but had no effect at a higher concentration of 1×10–5 mol/L. Er3+ had no effect on the transdifferentiation of OBs at tested concentrations. Er3+ inhibited the mineralization function of OBs at concentrations of 1×10–7,1×10–6,and 1×10–5 mol/L,but had no effect at a lower concentration of 1×10–8 mol/L. The expression of the mRNA for runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2) and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) was down-regulated in the presence of 1×10–6 mol/L Er3+. These findings suggested that Er3+ might have negative effect on bone metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   We report the synthesis and photoluminescence of a new molecular system designed based on diaminomaleonitrile derivatives. They are endowed with both aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) natures. More importantly, one of them,  i.e. , 2-amino-3-(( E )-(4-(diethylamino) benzylidene) amino)maleonitrile ( C4 ), exhibits unique vapochromism, namely a turn-on fluorescence in response to organic vapour. Based on spectral analysis, DFT calculation, SEM observation and crystallographic data, a mechanism for the vapochromic fluorescence was proposed: Donor-acceptor (D-A) coupling, which caused by the combined effect of π-π interaction and electrostatic force, is mainly responsible for the initial weak fluorescence of  C4 ; Its fluorescence will be spontaneously restored when D-A coupling is destructed by organic vapour. Such vapochromism of  C4  motivated us to develop a new optical data storage (ODS) capable of data encryption-decryption. Encrypted information in binary form can be stored on the device fabricated by  C4  film, which cannot be read unless it is treated by solvent fumigaition. After this decryption process, the fluorescent signals are remarkably enhanced, showing 3∼6-fold higher than false signals, which makes the former easy to be identified by both naked eyes and instruments. This study presents a successful archetype of security data storage, which only displays data at a specific condition. Otherwise, the data are concealed to avoid illegal reading or copying.",

A subtle change in the reaction conditions can cause the reaction to produce either cyclobutene product or alkenylboron compound with high chemoselectivity. Acetic acid solvent gives the alkenylboron compound as the major product, while methanol solvent favors the formation of the cyclobuteneboron product. Our calculations account for the observed solvent-controlled chemoselectivity. Lowering the polarity of the solvent disfavors the olefin insertion step and the formation of cyclobuteneboron product.",

        "abstract": "Wee1 plays a critical role in the arrest of G2/M cell cycle for DNA repair before entering mitosis. Many cancer cells have been identified as overexpression of Wee1. In this research, pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches were constructed to identify novel potential Wee1 inhibitors. A compound 8 was found to have a novel skeleton against Wee1 with an IC value of 22.32 µM and a K value of 13.11 µM. Kinetic assays were employed to evaluate the compound 8 as a competitive inhibitor. Compound 8 was tested against A-549 tumor cell lines with IC value of 17.8 µM. To investigate the intermolecular interaction of Wee1 and compound 8, further molecular dynamics simulations were performed. It indicates that the binding mode of compound 8 and reference ligand is similar. The active core scaffold of compound 8 could represent a promising lead compound for studying Wee1 and be used for further structural optimization to design more potent Wee1 inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) remains the most common causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and is related to high incidence and critical complications. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity might affect the outcome of CA16 infection. Our case-control research aims to evaluate the relationship between VDR polymorphisms in the gene encoding and susceptibility to and severity of HFMD due to CA16. Three SNPs of VDR gene were selected according to functional prediction and linkage disequilibrium, and were examined utilizing the SNPscan method to identify possible associations with HFMD caused by CA16. A significant relationship was found in the HFMD cases of polymorphism rs11574129 (GA vs. GG: odds ratio (OR) = 0.068, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.007-0.693, P = 0.023; GA+AA vs. GG: OR = 0.322, 95%CI = 0.106-0.984, P = 0.047), and vitamin D levels in genotype AA were significantly higher than those in genotype GG (P < 0.05). These results suggest that VDR rs11574129 may influence genetic susceptibility to CA16-associated HFMD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) presents with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Host immune response is a factor that influences disease susceptibility and severity. We investigated the potential association of gene polymorphisms in the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathway with the risk and severity of EV71 infection. A total of 180 EV71 HFMD cases (108 severe case; 72 mild cases) were enrolled. A group of 201 sex- and age-matched children was included as a control. All subjects were genotyped for the most common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRR and the PRR signalling pathway using the SNPscan multiple SNP typing method. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed statistically significant differences in polymorphism of RIG-1 between patients and controls (rs3739674 G vs. C: OR = 1.502, 95% CI: 1.120-2.014; rs9695310 G vs. C: OR = 1.782, 95% CI: 1.312-2.419). Polymorphisms of RIG-1 rs3739674 (G vs. C: OR = 2.047, 95% CI: 1.307-3.205) and TLR3 rs5743305 (A vs. T: OR = 0.346, 95% CI: 0.212-0.566) were found to be associated with disease severity. The results indicated that RIG-1 (rs3739674 and rs9695310) polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of EV71-induced HFMD in Chinese children, whereas RIG-1 rs3739674 and TLR3 rs5743305 polymorphisms are associated with disease severity. These findings support an important role of innate immune mechanism in EV71 infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",
