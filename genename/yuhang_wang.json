The seismic behavior of joints with outer stiffening ring with various types was studied based on experiments. The bearing capacity, rigidity, ductility, energy dissipation capacity, deformation property and strain distribution of the joints with outer stiffening ring with various types were comprehensively evaluated based on the test results of three specimens under reversed cyclic loading and finite element analysis. The test results show that the failure mode, hysteretic behavior, bearing capacity and rigidity degradation of the joints with outer stiffening ring of various types are nearly identical. Furthermore, the strain distribution of the outer stiffening ring of the three joints is nearly the same. High bearing capacity, ductility and energy dissipation capacity are observed. The improved constructional measures were proposed for the concrete beam-laminated steel tube column joints with outer stiffening ring, so that the seismic capacity of the joints could be ensured due to the convenient construction.",

The composite fiber beam-column model consists of a preprocessor program that is used to divide a composite section into fibers and a group of uniaxial hysteretic material constitutive models coded in the user defined subprogram UMAT in ABAQUS. The steel-concrete composite fiber beam-column model is suitable for global elasto-plastic analysis on composite frames with rigid connections subjected to the combined action of gravity and cyclic lateral loads. The model is verified by a large number of experiments and the results show that the developed composite fiber model possesses better accuracy and broader applicability compared with a traditional finite element model. Although the fiber beam-column model neglects the slip between the steel beam and concrete slab, there are essentially no effects on the global calculation results of steel-concrete composite frames. The proposed model has a simple modeling procedure, high calculation efficiency and great advantage when it is used to analyze composite frames subjected to cyclic loading due to earthquake. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "abstract": "When subjected to the horizontal earthquake load, compression-bending- torsion combined actions often exist in the piers of curved bridges because the center of stiffness and the center of mass of curved bridges do not locate at the same position. A new fiber beam-column element considering the nonlinear torsion behavior for concrete filled steel tubes with circular section was developed based on the traditional fiber beam-column model, which had widely been used. The calculation and solution procedures of the proposed fiber beam-column model were also illustrated. The reasonable geometrical relations, material constitutive law and force equilibrium equations were all applied. Based on the principles of fiber beam-column element considering torsion effect, a nonlinear solution program was developed using FORTRAN language. The entire loading history of concrete filled steel tube columns subjected to combined compression-bending-torsion load could be predicted with good agreement with test results. Using the proposed fiber beam-column model for the time-history analysis of curved steel-concrete composite girder bridges, the high solution precision and efficiency could be obtained, compared with the traditional finite element model. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

        "abstract": "The multiscale modeling method is newly introduced to the research on cable anchorage systems for self-anchored suspension bridges with steel box girders to improve the reliability of the conventional modeling methods. Two kinds of boundary conditions (BCs), the hard BCs and flexible BCs, are defined and illustrated. The strategy of the modeling method of the cable anchorage system for multiscale analysis is then introduced. Based on the proposed strategy, a multiscale model of the cable anchorage system is developed for the Taohuayu Bridge, which is the largest self-anchored suspension bridge in the world. For comparison, a scale model test is carried out, and two elaborate finite-element (FE) models, including a traditional scale model and a full-scale model, are established according to the traditional scale modeling method and full-scale modeling method. For further validation, a full-scale whole-bridge elaborate FE model is established, determined as the full-scale G model. In the test, a complex stress distribution of the anchor structure is newly observed. Intensive comparison study of various models demonstrates that the fuzzy region exists in the test model, scale model, and full-scale model, caused by the use of the assumption of hard BCs and the Saint-Venant principle. The fuzzy region cannot be quantitatively determined, leading to unreliable analysis results and a large amount of trial-and-error work. In the multiscale model, the complex BCs of the cable anchorage system are accurately simulated by the flexible BCs, and the influence of the fuzzy region is eliminated. The results of the multiscale model matches well with the full-scale G model. It is concluded that the multiscale modeling method is the most suitable modeling method to simulate the mechanical behaviors of the cable anchorage system of self-anchored bridges with steel box girders, reliably and efficiently. ? 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

In this paper, the effective flange width of steel\u2013concrete composite beams with openings in the concrete slab was studied by finite element method. The predicted results for the entire loading history of composite beams with openings in the concrete slab were verified by test results, and the axial normal stress distribution was analyzed in detail based on finite element analysis results. Then the parametric analysis was carried out for obtaining the practical simplified design method for calculating the effective width of steel\u2013concrete composite beams with openings in the concrete slab. At last, the predicted deflection of composite beams with openings in the concrete slab was compared with test results and finite element analysis results, showing that the simplified method for calculating the effective flange width of steel\u2013concrete composite beams with openings in concrete slab had enough precision and was suitable for practical design.",

        "abstract": "We used the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) to estimate carbon (C) storage and to analyze the impacts of environmental changes on C dynamics from 1971 to 2001 in Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GRSM). Our simulation results indicate that forests in GRSM have a C density as high as 15.9kgm(-2), about twice the regional average. Total carbon storage in GRSM in 2001 was 62.2Tg (T=10(12)), 54% of which was in vegetation, the rest in the soil detritus pool. Higher precipitation and lower temperatures in the higher elevation forests result in larger total C pool sizes than in forests at lower elevations. During the study period, the CO(2) fertilization effect dominated ozone and climatic stresses (temperature and precipitation), and the combination of these multiple factors resulted in net accumulation of 0.9Tg C in this ecosystem.",

First, we regress the observations on the model outputs with an autoregressive noise component. Second, we regress the residuals of this first regression on variables associated with wind speed, precipitation amounts and the diurnal cycle.

        "abstract": "A comprehensive comparison of positive matrix factorization (PMF) and molecular marker-based chemical mass balance (CMB-MM) modeling on PM2.5 source contributions was conducted for particulate matter measurements taken at Jefferson Street, Atlanta, Georgia (JST). The datasets used in each type of receptor modeling were different: CMB-MM used data of primarily organic tracers plus a couple elements measured from 51 24-h PM2.5 samples collected in July 2001 and January 2002. While for PMF, with elements, ions, five gaseous components, and eight temperature-resolved carbon fractions as the input data, both source profiles and contributions were resolved from a total of 932 daily PM2.5 samples covering a 3-year period between January 2000 and December 2002. The model results for the overlapping periods (July 2001 and January 2002) were extracted for comparison. Seven primary sources and three secondary sources were resolved by CMB-MM, while a total of nine primary and secondary factors were resolved by PMF. On average, 107% and 85% of PM2.5 mass were explained by CMB-MM and PMF, respectively, with secondary aerosols handled differently in the above two methods. Four similar sources were resolved by both methods, with good correlation for road dust, but fair for gasoline exhaust and wood combustion. The CMB-MM diesel exhaust has very poor correlation with the PMF resolved diesel exhaust. However, the CMB-MM combined mobile source has improved correlation with the PMF result as compared with the diesel exhaust source. If only the winter data were included, the CMB-MM combined mobile source shows enhanced correlation with the PMF combined source, as compared with the single source of diesel exhaust or gasoline exhaust.",

        "abstract": "We analyze summertime photochemistry near the surface in Beijing, China, using a 1-D photochemical model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model, REAM-1D) constrained by in situ observations, focusing on the budgets of RO x (OH + HO 2 + RO 2) radicals and O3 formation. While the modeling analysis focuses on near-surface photochemical budgets, the implications for the budget of O 3 in the planetary boundary layer are also discussed. In terms of daytime average, the total RO x primary production rate near the surface in Beijing is 6.6 ppbv per hour (ppbv h -1, among the highest found in urban atmospheres. The largest primary RO x source in Beijing is photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), which produces HO 2 and RO 2 at 2.5 ppbv h -1 and 1.7 ppbv h -1, respectively. Photolysis of excess HONO from an unknown heterogeneous source is the predominant primary OH source at 2.2 ppbv h -1, much larger than that of O1D+H2O (0.4 ppbv h -1). The largest RO x sink is via OH + NO 2 reaction (1.6 ppbv h -1), followed by formation of RO 2NO 2 (1.0 ppbv h -1) and RONO 2 (0.7 ppbv h -1). Due to the large aerosol surface area, aerosol uptake of HO 2 appears to be another important radical sink, although the estimate of its magnitude is highly variable depending on the uptake coefficient value used. The daytime average O 3 production and loss rates near the surface are 32 ppbv h -1 and 6.2 ppbv h -1, respectively. Assuming NO 2 to be the source of excess HONO, the NO 2 to HONO transformation leads to considerable O 3 loss and reduction of its lifetime. Our observation-constrained modeling analysis suggests that oxidation of VOCs (especially aromatics) and heterogeneous reactions (e.g. HONO formation and aerosol uptake HO 2) play potentially critical roles in the primary radical budget and O 3 formation in Beijing. One important ramification is that O 3 production is neither NOx nor VOC limited, but in a transition regime where reduction of either NOx or VOCs could result in reduction of O 3 production. The transition regime implies more flexibility in the O 3 control strategies than a binary system of either NO x or VOC limited regime. The co-benefit of concurrent reduction of both NO x and VOCs in reducing column O 3 production integrated in the planetary boundary layer is significant. Further research on the spatial extent of the transition regime over the polluted eastern China is critically important for controlling regional O 3 pollution. \u00a9 2012 Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Chemical loss of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is more important than the observed VOCs, which is the real actor of the chemical process in the atmosphere. The chemical loss of VOCs might impact on the identification of VOCs sources in ambient. For this reason, VOCs with 56 species were continuously measured in the urban area of Shanghai from 2009 to 2010, and based on the measurement the chemical loss of VOCs was calculated. According to the result, the initial VOCs in Shanghai urban was (34.8\u00b120.7) ppbv, higher than the observed one by ~35%, including alkanes (~38%), aromatics (~36%), alkenes (~17%), and acetylene (~8%). The chemical reactivity of VOCs would be underestimated by ~60% if thechemical loss were ignored. The chemical loss of VOCs showed a good agreement with Ox (O3+NO2). C7-C8 aromatics and C3-C5 alkenes contributed ~60% of consumed VOCs. Seven sources were identified and quantified from positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis. Vehicular emissions were the largest anthropogenic source of VOCs in Shanghai urban, accounting for 27.6% of VOCs, followed by solvent usage (19.4%), chemical industry (13.2%), petrochemical industry (9.1%), and coal burning (~5%). The contribution of biogenic emissions to total VOCs was 5.8%. Besides the five local anthropogenic sources and one biogenic source, the regional transportation was identified as one important source, contributing about 20% of VOCs in Shanghai urban. Sources apportionment results from PMF analysis based on the initial VOCs showed some differences from those based on observed data and might be more appropriate to be applied into the formulation of air pollution control measures. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

This method allows for estimating emission changes with a finer temporal resolution than previous studies and shows that the progression of the emission reduction corresponds roughly to the scheduled implementation of emission controls over Beijing. OMI column NO 2 reductions are approximately 45%, 33%, and 14% over urban Beijing, rural Beijing, and the Huabei Plain, respectively, while the corresponding anthropogenic NO x emission reductions are only 28%, 24%, and 6%, during the full emission control period (July 20-Sep 20, 2008). Meteorological changes from summer 2007 to 2008 are the main factor contributing to the column NO 2 decreases not accounted for by the emission reduction. The surface ozone changes due to NO x emission reduction are negligible using a standard VOC emission inventory. When using enhanced VOC (particularly aromatics) emissions derived from in situ observations, urban Beijing shifted O 3 production from the VOC-limited regime toward the NO x-limited regime resulting in a more substantial ozone decrease (up to 10 ppbv). \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.",

Changes of summertime ozone and free radical concentrations due to the additional heterogeneous reactions in north China were quantified. These heterogeneous reactions increased the O, OH, HO and RO concentrations by up to 20%, 28%, 36% and 48% for some regions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area. These areas typically have a larger amount of NOx emissions and a lower VOC/NOx ratio. The zero-out method evaluates that the photolysis of ClNO and Cl are the major contributors (42.4% and 57.6%, respectively) to atmospheric Cl in the early morning hours but the photolysis of Cl is the only significant contributor after 10:00\u202fam. The results highlight that heterogeneous reactions of reactive chlorine species are important to atmospheric ozone and free-radical formation. Our study also suggests that the on-going NOx emission controls in the NCP region with a goal to reduce both O and secondary nitrate can also have the co-benefit of reducing the formation Cl from ClNO and Cl, which may also lead to lower secondary organic aerosol formation and thus the control of summertime PM in the region.",

Source apportionment results using the two receptor models are analyzed and compared. Both models are able to identify major sources at all sites, though the degree of agreements and correlations between source impacts estimated by PMF and CMB varies depending on sources and receptor sites. Estimated contributions of secondary inorganic particles are the most comparable and highly correlated. The lesser comparability and correlations of estimated contributions of other sources (mostly primary) may be attributed to several factors. Resolved source profiles in PMF have more processed (or aged) characteristics resulting in part from atmospheric mixing and condensation of oxidized compounds, whereas source profiles used in CMB are obtained from measurements of emission sources with minimum amount of atmospheric processing. The PMF profiles vary from site to site; both atmospheric processing and local source variability contribute. In comparison, the CMB profiles obtained from a limited number of emission measurements may not be locally representative even if they are regionally representative. The omission of possible known or unknown sources due to lack of proper source profiles or proper ''marker'' species may also cause the differences in the source apportionment results. In addition, the implication for PM time-series health study is discussed based on the results from this study. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Multiple linear regression (MLR) was applied to regress the total PM mass,against the estimated,source,contributions. The regression coefficients were,used to scale the factor profiles. Nine factors were resolved at two urban sites (Atlanta, GA (JST) and Birmingham, AL (BHM)) and one rural site (Centerville, AL (CTR)). Eight factors were resolved at the other rural site (Yorkville, GA (YRK)). Six factors we refer to as soil, coal combustion/other, diesel emission, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, and wood smoke are common among the four sites. Two industry-related factors are similar at the two sites in the same state, but differ between states. Contrary to previous results using only PM2.5 data with non-speciated EC and OC data, diesel and gasoline emission factors were resolved at the two urban sites instead of only one single motor,vehicle factor; diesel and gasoline factors were also resolved at the CTR site and,a diesel factor was,found,at YRK instead of no motor,vehicle factors at the two rural sites. The inclusion of gas components,also improved,the identification of the coal combustion/other,factor among the four sites.

        "abstract": "Abstract The Antarctic Tropospheric,Chemistry Investigation (ANTCI) was carried out from late November,to December,2003 with both extended ground-based and tethered balloon studies at Amundsen Scott Station, South Pole. ANTCI 2003 was the first of two,Antarctic field studies with the primary,goal of further exploring the active photochemistry,of the South Pole region that was,first identified in the previous,Investigation of Sulfur Chemistry,in the Antarctic Troposphere (ISCAT) program. Since ISCAT was fully ground-based, ANTCI 2003 goals included expanding chemical studies both vertically upward,to investigate mixing,and,horizontally to better understand,large-scale plateau NOx production,and transport. Thus, in addition to ground-based experiments at South Pole, Twin Otter aircraft sampling took place out to hundreds,of kilometers in several directions from,the South Pole. These were designed,to specifically address the issue of how,representative past South Pole chemical,measurements,are of the surrounding,high plateau region.

        "abstract": "Abstract The first airborne measurements,of nitric oxide (NO) on the Antarctic plateau have demonstrated,that the previously reported,elevated levels of this species extend,well beyond,the immediate,vicinity of South Pole. Although,the current database is still relatively weak and critical laboratory experiments are still needed, the findings here suggest that the chemical uniqueness of the plateau may be substantially greater than first reported. For example, South Pole ground-based findings have provided,new evidence showing,that the dominant,process driving the release of nitrogen from the snowpack during the spring/summer,season (post-depositional loss) is photochemical,in nature with evaporative,processes playing a lesser role. There is also new evidence suggesting that nitrogen, in the form of nitrate, may undergo multiple recycling within a given photochemical,season. Speculation here is that this may,be a unique,property,of the plateau and,much related to its having,persistent cold temperatures,even during summer.,These conditions promote,the efficient adsorption of molecules,like HNO3 (and very likely HO2NO2) onto snow-pack,surface ice where,we have,hypothesized,enhanced photochemical processing can occur, leading to the efficient release of NOx to the atmosphere. In addition, to these process-oriented tentative conclusions, the findings from the airborne studies, in conjunction with modeling exercises suggest a new,paradigm,for the plateau atmosphere. The near-surface atmosphere,over this massive,region can be viewed as serving as much,more,than a temporary,reservoir or holding tank for imported,chemical,species. It defines an immense atmospheric,chemical,reactor which is capable of modifying,the chemical characteristics of select atmospheric,constituents. This reactor has most likely been in place over geological time, and may have led to the chemical modulation of some trace ARTICLE IN PRESS",

        "abstract": "The East China Plains (ECP) region experienced the worst haze pollution on record for January in 2013. We show that the unprecedented haze event is due to the extremely poor ventilation conditions, which had not been seen in the preceding three decades. Statistical analysis suggests that the extremely poor ventilation conditions are linked to Arctic sea ice loss in the preceding autumn and extensive boreal snowfall in the earlier winter. We identify the regional circulation mode that leads to extremely poor ventilation over the ECP region. Climate model simulations indicate that boreal cryospheric forcing enhances the regional circulation mode of poor ventilation in the ECP region and provides conducive conditions for extreme haze such as that of 2013. Consequently, extreme haze events in winter will likely occur at a higher frequency in China as a result of the changing boreal cryosphere, posing difficult challenges for winter haze mitigation but providing a strong incentive for greenhouse gas emission reduction.",

        "abstract": "Molecular chlorine (Cl) and nitryl chloride (ClNO) concentrations were measured using chemical ionization mass spectrometry at a rural site over the North China Plain during June 2014. High levels of daytime Cl up to \u223c450 pptv were observed. The average diurnal Cl mixing ratios showed a maximum around noon at \u223c100 pptv. ClNO exhibited a strong diurnal variation with early morning maxima reaching ppbv levels and afternoon minima sustained above 60 pptv. A moderate correlation (R = 0.31) between Cl and sulfur dioxide was observed, perhaps indicating a role for power plant emissions in the generation of the observed chlorine. We also observed a strong correlation (R = 0.83) between daytime (10:00-20:00) Cl and ClNO, which implies that both of them were formed from a similar mechanism. In addition, Cl production is likely associated with a photochemical mechanism as Cl concentrations varied with ozone (O) levels. The impact of Cl and ClNO as Cl atom sources is investigated using a photochemical box model. We estimated that the produced Cl atoms oxidized slightly more alkanes than OH radicals and enhanced the daily concentrations of peroxy radicals by 15% and the O production rate by 19%.",

        "abstract": "HFO-1234yf (2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene) was proposed as a mobile air conditioners (MACs) refrigerant worldwide. However, its atmospheric degradation product is the highly soluble and phytotoxic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which persists in aquatic environments. We used a global 3-D chemical transport model to assess the potential environmental effects resulting from complete future conversion of all MACs to HFO-1234yf in China, the United States and Europe. The annual mean atmospheric concentrations of HFO-1234yf were 2.62, 2.20 and 2.73 pptv, and the mean deposition rates of TFA were 0.96, 0.45 and 0.52 kg km-2 yr-1, in three regions. Regional TFA deposition sources mainly came from emissions within the same region. Annual TFA deposition in the North Pole region was lower than the global average and mainly originated from European emissions. A potential doubling in the future HFO-1234yf emissions in China mainly affected the local TFA depositions. The TFA concentrations in rainwater were strongly affected by the regional precipitation rates. North Africa and the Middle East, regions with scant rainfall had, extremely high TFA concentrations. The rainwater concentrations of TFA during individual rain events can exceed the level considered to be safe, indicating substantial potential regional risks from future HFO-1234yf use.",

        "abstract": "Meteorological conditions, gas-phase precursors, and aerosol acidity (pH) can influence the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) in fine particulate matter (PM). Most works related to the influence of pH and gas-phase precursors on SIA have been laboratory research, but field observation research is very scarce, especially in arid environments. The relationship among SIA, pH, gas-phase precursors, and meteorological conditions are investigated in Hohhot, a major city in China with an arid environment. Secondary inorganic species, e.g., SO, NO, were typically found at low levels, reflecting the low level of secondary aerosol. It is interesting to note that the level of SO in Hohhot was higher than in other cities while SO was relatively lower than in other cities. Multiple receptor models were used to explore the contributions to the SIA and quantify the source impacts on the SIA. Annual average aerosol pH in Hohhot was 5.6 (range 1.1-8.4) which was estimated by a thermodynamic equilibrium model. Additionally, a statistical method was used to evaluate the influence of SIA sources on ambient aerosol concentrations. Aerosol water content and particulate acidity were found to be positively associated with secondary SO, while NO and RH had a significant impact on secondary NO in an arid atmosphere. The findings explain the relationship between gaseous precursors, relative humidity, aerosol pH and temperature in the arid city of Hohhot.",

        "abstract": "Ground-level ozone is adverse to human and vegetation health. High ground-level ozone concentrations usually occur over the United States in the summer, often referred to as the ozone season. However, observed monthly mean ozone concentrations in the southeastern United States were higher in October than July in 2010. The October ozone average in 2010 reached that of July in the past three decades (1980\u20132010). Our analysis shows that this extreme October ozone in 2010 over the Southeast is due in part to a dry and warm weather condition, which enhances photochemical production, air stagnation, and fire emissions. Observational evidence and modeling analysis also indicate that another significant contributor is enhanced emissions of biogenic isoprene, a major ozone precursor, from water-stressed plants under a dry and warm condition. The latter finding is corroborated by recent laboratory and field studies. This climate-induced biogenic control also explains the puzzling fact that the two extremes of high October ozone both occurred in the 2000s when anthropogenic emissions were lower than the 1980s and 1990s, in contrast to the observed decreasing trend of July ozone in the region. The occurrences of a drying and warming fall, projected by climate models, will likely lead to more active photochemistry, enhanced biogenic isoprene and fire emissions, an extension of the ozone season from summer to fall, and an increase of secondary organic aerosols in the Southeast, posing challenges to regional air quality management.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Extreme weather events can strongly affect surface air quality, which has become a major environmental factor to affect human health. Here, we examined the relationship between extreme ozone and PM2.5 (particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm) events and the representative meteorological parameters such as daily maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), and minimum wind speed (Vmin), using the location-specific 95th or 5th percentile threshold derived from historical reanalysis data (30\u00a0years for ozone and 10\u00a0years for PM2.5). We found that ozone and PM2.5 extremes were decreasing over the years, reflecting EPAu0027s tightened standards and effort on reducing the corresponding precursoru0027s emissions. Annual ozone and PM2.5 extreme days were highly correlated with Tmax and RHmin, especially in the eastern U.S. They were positively (negatively) correlated with Vmin in urban (rural and suburban) stations. The overlapping ratios of ozone extreme days with Tmax were fairly constant, about 32%, and tended to be high in fall and low in winter. Ozone extreme days were most sensitive to Tmax, then RHmin, and least sensitive to Vmin. The majority of ozone extremes occurred when Tmax was between 300\u00a0K and 320\u00a0K, RHmin was less than 40%, and Vmin was less than 3\u00a0m/s. The number of annual extreme PM2.5\u00a0days was highly positively correlated with the extreme RHmin/Tmax days, with correlation coefficient between PM2.5/RHmin highest in urban and suburban regions and the correlation coefficient between PM2.5/Tmax highest in rural area. Tmax has more impact on PM2.5 extreme over the eastern U.S. Extreme PM2.5\u00a0days were more likely to occur at low RH conditions in the central and southeastern U.S., especially during spring time, and at high RH conditions in the northern U.S. and the Great Plains. Most extreme PM2.5 events occurred when Tmax was between 300\u00a0K and 320\u00a0K and RHmin was between 10% and 50%. Extreme PM2.5\u00a0days usually occurred when Vmin was under 2\u00a0m/s. However, during spring season in the Southeast and fall season in Northwest, high winds were found to accompany extreme PM2.5\u00a0days, likely reflecting the impact of fire emissions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Aerosols from open-land fires could significantly perturb the global radiation balance and induce climate change. In this study, Community Atmosphere Model version\u00a05 (CAM5) with prescribed daily fire aerosol emissions is used to investigate the spatial and seasonal characteristics of radiative effects (REs, relative to the case of no fires) of open-fire aerosols including black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM) from 2003 to 2011. The global annual mean RE from aerosol\u2013radiation interactions (REari) of all fire aerosols is 0.16  \u00b1  0.01  W  m \u22122  (1 \u03c3  uncertainty), mainly due to the absorption of fire BC (0.25  \u00b1  0.01  W  m \u22122 ), while fire POM induces a small effect (\u22120.05 and 0.04  \u00b1  0.01  W  m \u22122  based on two different methods). Strong positive REari is found in the Arctic and in the oceanic regions west of southern Africa and South America as a result of amplified absorption of fire BC above low-level clouds, in general agreement with satellite observations. The global annual mean RE due to aerosol\u2013cloud interactions (REaci) of all fire aerosols is \u22120.70  \u00b1  0.05  W  m \u22122 , resulting mainly from the fire POM effect (\u22120.59  \u00b1  0.03  W  m \u22122 ). REari (0.43  \u00b1  0.03  W  m \u22122 ) and REaci (\u22121.38  \u00b1  0.23  W  m \u22122 ) in the Arctic are stronger than in the tropics (0.17  \u00b1  0.02 and \u22120.82  \u00b1  0.09  W  m \u22122  for REari and REaci), although the fire aerosol burden is higher in the tropics. The large cloud liquid water path over land areas and low solar zenith angle of the Arctic favor the strong fire aerosol REaci (up to \u221215  W  m \u22122 ) during the Arctic summer. Significant surface cooling, precipitation reduction and increasing amounts of low-level cloud are also found in the Arctic summer as a result of the fire aerosol REaci based on the atmosphere-only simulations. The global annual mean RE due to surface-albedo changes (REsac) over land areas (0.03  \u00b1  0.10  W  m \u22122 ) is small and statistically insignificant and is mainly due to the fire BC-in-snow effect (0.02  W  m \u22122 ) with the maximum albedo effect occurring in spring (0.12  W  m \u22122 ) when snow starts to melt.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in the gas phase and total suspended particulate (TSP) from summer 2014 to spring 2015 in Taiyuan, northern China. Taiyuan is an area with some of the highest atmospheric PAH levels in the world, and the total PAHs was highest in winter, followed by autumn, spring and summer. Low air temperature and a southern wind with low speed often led to higher PAH levels in Taiyuan. Although less than a half fraction, the benzo[ a ]pyrene equivalent concentration (BEQ) of particulate PAHs was almost equal to that of the total PAHs. Four sources, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coke processing and biomass burning, were determined by positive matrix factorization (PMF), with contributions of 41.36%, 24.74%, 19.71% and 14.18% to the total PAHs in Taiyuan, respectively. Compared with the total PAHs, the particulate PAH solution underestimated the contribution of the coke processing, especially in winter, and overestimated vehicle emissions. The coke processing had a greater contribution to atmospheric PAHs with a southern wind at low speeds in winter in Taiyuan. Ultimately, the coke plants distributed in the Taiyuan-Linfen-Yuncheng basin should receive greater attention for air quality improvement in Taiyuan.",

        "title": "Investigation of short-term effective radiative forcing of fire aerosols over North America using nudged hindcast ensembles",
        "abstract": "Aerosols from fire emissions can potentially have large impact on clouds and radiation. However, fire aerosol sources are often intermittent, and their effect on weather and climate is difficult to quantify. Here we investigated the short-term effective radiative forcing of fire aerosols using the global aerosol\u2013climate model Community Atmosphere Model version\u00a05 (CAM5). Different from previous studies, we used nudged hindcast ensembles to quantify the forcing uncertainty due to the chaotic response to small perturbations in the atmosphere state. Daily mean emissions from three fire inventories were used to consider the uncertainty in emission strength and injection heights. The simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) and mass concentrations were evaluated against in situ measurements and reanalysis data. Overall, the results show the model has reasonably good predicting skills. Short (10-day) nudged ensemble simulations were then performed with and without fire emissions to estimate the effective radiative forcing. Results show fire aerosols have large effects on both liquid and ice clouds over the two selected regions in April 2009. Ensemble mean results show strong negative shortwave cloud radiative effect (SCRE) over almost the entirety of southern Mexico, with a 10-day regional mean value of \u22123.0\u202fW\u202fm \u22122 . Over the central US, the SCRE is positive in the north but negative in the south, and the regional mean SCRE is small (\u22120.56\u202fW\u202fm \u22122 ). For the 10-day average, we found a large ensemble spread of regional mean shortwave cloud radiative effect over southern Mexico (15.6\u202f% of the corresponding ensemble mean) and the central US (64.3\u202f%), despite the regional mean AOD time series being almost indistinguishable during the 10-day period. Moreover, the ensemble spread is much larger when using daily averages instead of 10-day averages. This demonstrates the importance of using a large ensemble of simulations to estimate the short-term aerosol effective radiative forcing.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed a significant influx of air pollution from south Asia to Himalayas and Tibet Plateau (TP) during pre-monsoon period. In order to characterize the chemical composition, sources, and transport mechanism of polluted air mass in this pristine area, we performed a field study during June 2015 by deploying a suite of online instruments including an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) and a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP) at Nam Co Station (90\u00b057u0027\u2009E, 30\u00b046\u2009u0027\u2009N 4730\u2009m\u2009a.s.l.) at the central of the TP. The measurements were made at a time when the transition from pre-monsoon to monsoon occurred. The average ambient mass concentration of submicron particulate matter (PM 1 ) over the whole campaign period was 2.0\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m \u22123 , with organics accounting for 64\u2009%, followed by sulfate (16\u2009%), black carbon (9\u2009%), ammonium (8\u2009%), and nitrate (3\u2009%). This mass loading and composition were comparable with most of AMS results in remote sites worldwide. Air pollution episodes were observed during the pre-monsoon period, while consistently low aerosol concentrations were observed during the monsoon period. However, the chemical composition of aerosol during the air pollution episodes in the pre-monsoon season was on a case-by-case basis, depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and air mass transport routes. Most of the chemical species exhibited significant diurnal variations with higher values occurring during afternoon and lower values during early morning time whereas nitrate peaked during early morning in association with higher relative humidity and lower air temperature. Organic aerosol (OA) was more oxidized with an oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O\u2009/\u2009C) of 0.94 during the pre-monsoon period than during monsoon (average O\u2009/\u2009C of 0.48). The average O\u2009/\u2009C of OA was 0.88 over the entire campaign period. Positive matrix factorization of the high resolution mass spectra of OA identified two oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) factors: a less oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and a more oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). The MO-OOA dominated during the pre-monsoon period, while LO-OOA dominated during the monsoon. The sensitivity of air pollution transport with synoptic process was also evaluated with a 3-D chemical transport model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Obtaining the full spatial coverage of daily surface ozone fields is challenging because of the sparsity of the surface monitoring network and the difficulty in direct satellite retrievals of surface ozone. We propose an indirect satellite retrieval framework to utilize the information from satellite-measured column densities of tropospheric NO 2  and CH 2 O, which are sensitive to the lower troposphere, to derive surface ozone fields. The method is applicable to upcoming geostationary satellites with high-quality NO 2  and CH 2 O measurements. To prove the concept, we conduct a simulation experiment using a 3-D chemical transport model for July 2011 over the eastern US. The results show that a second order regression using both NO 2  and CH 2 O column densities can be an effective predictor for daily maximum 8-h average ozone. Furthermore, this indirect retrieval approach is shown to be complementary to spatial interpolation of surface observations, especially in regions where the surface sites are sparse. Combining column observations of NO 2  and CH 2 O with surface site measurements leads to an improved representation of surface ozone over simple kriging, increasing the R 2  value from 0.53 to 0.64\u202fat a surface site distance of 252\u202fkm. The improvements are even more significant with larger surface site distances. The simulation experiment suggests that the indirect satellite retrieval technique can potentially be a useful tool to derive the full spatial coverage of daily surface ozone fields if satellite observation uncertainty is moderate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Recent studies have shown that surface ozone ( O 3  )concentrations over central eastern China (CEC) have increased significantlyduring the past decade. We quantified the effects  changes inmeteorological conditions and  O 3   precursor emissions on surface  O 3   over CEC between July 2003 and July 2015 using the GEOS-Chem model.The simulated monthly mean maximum daily 8  h average  O 3   concentration(MDA8  O 3  ) in July increased by approximately 13.6  %, from  65.5\u00b17.9   ppbv (2003) to  74.4\u00b18.7   ppbv (2015), comparable to the observedresults. The change in meteorology led to an increase in MDA8  O 3   of 5.8\u00b13.9   ppbv over the central part  CEC, in contrast to a decreaseof about     -  0.8  \u00b1  3.5           ppbv over the eastern part  the region. Incomparison, the MDA8  O 3   over the central and eastern parts  CECincreased by  3.5\u00b11.4  and  5.6\u00b11.8   ppbv due to the increasedemissions. The increase in averaged  O 3   in the CEC region resulting fromthe emission increase ( 4.0\u00b11.9   ppbv) was higher than that caused bymeteorological changes ( 3.1\u00b14.9   ppbv) relative to the 2003 standardsimulation, while the regions with larger  O 3   increases showed a highersensitivity to meteorological conditions than to emission changes.Sensitivity tests indicate that increased levels  anthropogenic non-methanevolatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) dominate the  O 3   increase over theeastern part  CEC, and anthropogenic nitrogen oxides ( NO  x   ) mainly increaseMDA8  O 3   over the central and western parts and decrease  O 3   in afew urban areas in the eastern part. Budget analysis showed that netphotochemical production and meteorological conditions (transport inparticular) are two important factors that influence  O 3   levels over theCEC. The results  this study suggest a need to further assess theeffectiveness  control strategies for  O 3   pollution in the context ofregional meteorology and anthropogenic emission changes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Atmospheric transport of black carbon (BC) from surrounding areas has been shown to impact the Tibetan environment, and clarifying the geographical source and receptor regions is crucial for providing guidance for mitigation actions. In this study, 10 trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sampled across Tibet are chosen as proxies to diagnose source regions and related transport of pollutants to Tibet. The levels of these VOCs in Tibet are higher than those in the Arctic and Antarctic regions but much lower than those observed at many remote and background sites in Asia. The highest VOC level is observed in the eastern region, followed by the southern region and the northern region. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model found that three factors\u2014industry, biomass burning, and traffic\u2014present different spatial distributions, which indicates that different zones of Tibet are influenced by different VOC sources. The average age of the air masses in the northern and eastern regions is estimated to be 3.5 and 2.8 days using the ratio of toluene to benzene, respectively, which indicates the foreign transport of VOC species to those regions. Back-trajectory analyses show that the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Tajikistan region, Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), and Meghalaya-Myanmar region could transport industrial VOCs to different zones of Tibet from west to east. The agricultural bases in northern India could transport biomass burning-related VOCs to the middle-northern and eastern zones of Tibet. High traffic along the unique national roads in Tibet is associated with emissions from local sources and neighboring areas. Our study proposes international joint-control efforts and targeted actions to mitigate the climatic changes and effects associated with VOCs in Tibet, which is a climate sensitive region and an important source of global water.",

This study focuses on how to improve OMI NO 2  retrievals for more reliable trend analysis. We retrieve OMI tropospheric NO 2  vertical column densities (VCDs) and obtain the NO 2  seasonal trends over the United States, which are compared with coincident in situ surface NO 2  measurements from the Air Quality System (AQS) network. The Mann-Kendall method is applied to derive the NO 2  seasonal and annual trends for four regions at coincident sites during 2005\u20132014. The OMI-based NO 2  seasonal relative trends are generally biased high compared to the in situ trends by up to 3.7\u2009%\u2009yr \u22121 , except for the underestimation in the Midwest and Northeast during Dec\u2013Jan\u2013Feb (DJF). We improve the OMI retrievals for trend analysis by removing the ocean trend, using the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data in air mass factor (AMF) calculation, and applying a lightning flash filter to exclude lightning affected OMI NO 2  retrievals. These improvements result in close agreement (within 0.3\u2009%\u2009yr \u22121 ) between in situ and OMI-based NO 2  regional annual relative trends. Thus, we recommend future studies to apply these procedures to ensure the quality of satellite-based NO 2  trend analysis, especially in regions without reliable long-term in situ NO 2  measurements. We derive optimized OMI-based NO 2  regional annual relative trends using all available data for the West (\u22122.0\u2009%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009yr \u22121 ), the Midwest (\u22121.8\u2009%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009yr \u22121 ), the Northeast (\u22123.1\u2009%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009yr \u22121 ), and the South (\u22120.9\u2009%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009yr \u22121 ).

It is a factor of 2 lower than that of the AQS in situ data (\u22123.9\u2009%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009yr \u22121 ); the difference is mainly due to the fact that the locations of AQS sites are concentrated in urban and suburban regions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  In the summer of 2017, heavy ozone pollution swamped most of the North China Plain (NCP), with the maximum regional average of daily maximum 8-h ozone concentration (MDA8) reaching almost 120\u2009ppbv. In light of the continuing reduction of anthropogenic emissions in China, the underlying mechanisms for the occurrences of these regional extreme ozone episodes are elucidated from two perspectives: meteorology and biogenic emissions. The significant positive correlation between MDA8 and temperature, which is amplified during heat waves concomitant with stagnant air and no precipitation, supports the crucial role of meteorology in driving high ozone concentrations. We also find that biogenic emissions are enhanced due to factors previously not considered. During the heavy ozone pollution episodes in June 2017, biogenic emissions driven by high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), land cover change and urban landscape yield an extra mean MDA8 ozone of 3.08, 2.79 and 4.74\u2009ppbv, respectively over the NCP, which together contribute as much to MDA8 ozone as biogenic emissions simulated using the land cover of 2003 and ignoring VPD and urban landscape. In Beijing, the biogenic emission increase due to urban landscape has a comparable effect on MDA8 ozone to the combined effect of high VPD and land cover change between 2003 and 2016. This study highlights the vital contributions of heat waves, land cover change and urbanization to the occurrence of extreme ozone episode, with significant implications for ozone pollution control in a future when heat wave frequency and intensity are projected to increase under global warming.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing the vertical distribution of aerosol optical properties is crucial to reduce the uncertainty in quantifying the radiative forcing and climate effects of aerosols. The analysis of four-year (2007-2010) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar measurements revealed the existence of tropospheric aerosol layers associated with the Asian summer monsoon. The measurements of five typical aerosol optical and microphysical parameters were used to explore the properties, spatial/vertical distributions, annual evolution of tropopause aerosols over the South Asia region. Results extracted from various latitude-height and longitude-height cross sections of aerosol extinction coefficient at 532 and 1064\u202fnm, backscatter coefficient at 532\u202fnm, and depolarization ratio at 532\u202fnm demonstrated that a large amount of aerosols vertically extended up to the tropopause (12\u202fkm) during the monsoon season over the north Arabian Sea, India, north Bay of Bengal, and equatorial Indian Ocean, finally reaching the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau. Convective transport associated with Asian summer monsoon is an important factor controlling the vertical distribution of tropopause aerosols. The evolution of aerosol scattering ratio at 532\u202fnm indicated that from equatorial Indian Ocean to South Asia, there exists an upward tilting and ascending structure of the aerosols layer during the monsoon season, which typically indicates enhanced aerosols over the Asian monsoon region. Information on aerosol size distribution and detailed composition are needed for better understanding the nature and origin of this aerosol layer. Enhancement of the tropopause aerosols should be considered in the future studies in evaluating the regional or global climate systems. Further satellite observations of aerosols and in-situ observations are also urgently needed to diagnose this aerosol layer, which likely originate from anthropogenic emissions.",

        "abstract": "In order to alleviate extreme haze pollution, understanding the origin of fine particulate matter (PM) is crucial. In this study, we applied Particulate Matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) in CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) to quantify the impacts of emissions from different regions on PM concentrations in Beijing for haze episodes during January 6-23, 2013. Emission inventory was developed by Tsinghua University. Evolution of local and Regional contributions during local and non-local dominated haze episodes were discussed, separately. In the meanwhile, average contribution of other every city in Jing-Jin-Ji region to PM concentrations larger than 75\u03bcgm in Beijing urban for each range of local contribution percent was analyzed. The results indicate that local emissions contributed 83.6% of PM at the urban center of Beijing, while regional transport from surrounding cities and parts of Shandong, Henan and Anhui provinces contributed 9.4%; long-range transport contributed the remaining 7.0% mainly from areas >750km away to the south of Beijing during this study period. Compared to non-local-dominated haze episodes, local-dominated heavy haze episodes in Beijing were easily resulted from unfavorable meteorological conditions with much lower PBL and wind velocity. Furthermore, local contribution is more easily to cause a sharp increase or sharp reduction of PM concentration in central Beijing, reflecting that Beijing local has much stronger potential to form extremely heavy haze episodes. The results indicated that controlling local emissions is a much more important measure to alleviate the extreme haze episodes in Beijing, like that on the night of Jan 12, 2013. Furthermore, emission control in Jing-Jin-Ji region, especially in Tangshan, Tianjin, Baoding, Langfang, Shijiazhuang and Cangzhou, as well as Henan and Shandong province, are important to reduce the PM concentrations and the occurrence of haze episodes in Beijing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Long-range\u00a0transport followed by deposition of black carbon on glaciers of Tibet is one of the key issues of climate research as it induces changes on radiative forcing and subsequently impacting the melting of glaciers. The transport mechanism, however, is not well understood. In this study, we use short-lived reactive aromatics as proxies to diagnose transport of pollutants to Tibet. In situ observations of short-lived reactive aromatics across the Tibetan Plateau are analyzed using a regional chemistry and transport model. The model performance using the current emission inventories over the region is poor due to problems in the inventories and model transport. Top-down\u00a0emissions constrained by satellite observations of glyoxal are a factor of 2\u20136 higher than the a priori emissions over the industrialized Indo-Gangetic Plain. Using the top-down emissions, agreement between model simulations and surface observations of aromatics improves. We find enhancements of reactive aromatics over Tibet by a factor of 6 on average due to rapid transport from India and nearby regions during the presence of a high-altitude cut-off low system. Our results suggest that the cut-off low system is a major pathway for long-range transport of pollutants such as black carbon. The modeling analysis reveals that even the state-of-the-science high-resolution reanalysis cannot simulate this cut-off low system accurately, which probably explains in part the underestimation of black carbon deposition over Tibet in previous modeling studies. Another model deficiency of underestimating pollution transport from the south is due to the complexity of terrain, leading to enhanced transport. It is therefore challenging for coarse-resolution global climate models to properly represent the effects of long-range transport of pollutants on the Tibetan environment and the subsequent consequence for regional climate forcing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Recent studies have revealed a significant influx of anthropogenic aerosolfrom South Asia to the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau (TP) during pre-monsoonperiod. In order to characterize the chemical composition, sources, andtransport processes of aerosol in this area, we carried out a field studyduring June 2015 by deploying a suite of online instruments including anAerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS)and a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP) at Nam Co station(90  \u2218  57  \u2032  \u202fE, 30  \u2218  46  \u2032  \u202fN; 4730\u202fm\u202fa.s.l.) at thecentral of the TP. The measurements were made at a period when the transitionfrom pre-monsoon to monsoon occurred. The average ambient mass concentrationof submicron particulate matter (PM  1 )  over the whole campaign  \u223c \u202f2.0\u202f \u00b5 g\u202fm  \u22123  , with organics accounting for 68\u202f%,followed by sulfate (15\u202f%), black carbon (8\u202f%), ammonium (7\u202f%), andnitrate (2\u202f%). Relatively higher aerosol mass concentration episodes wereobserved during the pre-monsoon period, whereas persistently low aerosolconcentrations were observed during the monsoon period. However, the chemicalcomposition of aerosol during the higher aerosol concentration episodes inthe pre-monsoon season was on a case-by-case basis, depending on theprevailing meteorological conditions and air mass transport routes. Most ofthe chemical species exhibited significant diurnal variations with highervalues occurring during afternoon and lower values during early morning,whereas nitrate peaked during early morning in association with higherrelative humidity and lower air temperature. Organic aerosol (OA), with an oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O\u202f \u2215 \u202fC) of 0.94, was moreoxidized during the pre-monsoon period than during monsoon (average O\u202f \u2215 \u202fC ratio of 0.72), and an average O\u202f \u2215 \u202fC was 0.88over the entire campaign period, suggesting overall highly oxygenated aerosolin the central TP. Positive matrix factorization of the high-resolution massspectra of OA identified two oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) factors: a lessoxidized OOA (LO-OOA) and a more oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). The MO-OOA dominatedduring the pre-monsoon period, whereas LO-OOA dominated during monsoon. Thesensitivity of air mass transport during pre-monsoon with synoptic processwas also evaluated with a 3-D chemical transport model.",

Lightning flash rates are parameterized functions of meteorological variables related to convection. We examine a suite of such variables and find that convective available potential energy and cloud top height give the best estimates compared to July 2010 observations from ground-based lightning observation networks. Previous models often use lightning NOx vertical profiles derived from cloud-resolving model simulations. An implicit assumption of such an approach is that the postconvection lightning NOx vertical distribution is the same for all deep convection, regardless of geographic location, time of year, or meteorological environment. Detailed observations of the lightning channel segment altitude distribution derived from the NASA Lightning Nitrogen Oxides Model can be used to obtain the LNOx emission profile. Coupling such a profile with model convective transport leads to a more self-consistent lightning distribution compared to using prescribed postconvection profiles. We find that convective redistribution appears to be a more important factor than preconvection LNOx profile selection, providing another reason for linking the strength of convective transport to LNOx distribution.",

        "abstract": "Observations over the tropical Pacific during the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM)-Tropics B experiment (March-April 1999) are analyzed. Concentrations of CO and long-lived nonmethane hydrocarbons in the region are significantly enhanced due to trans- port of pollutants from northern industrial continents. This pollutant import also enhances moderately O3 concentrations but not NOx concentrations. It therefore tends to depress OH concentrations over the tropical Pacific. These effects contrast to the large enhancements of O3 and NOx concentrations and the moderate increase of OH concentrations due to biomass burning outflow during the PEM-Tropics A experiment (September-October 1996). Observed CH3I concentrations, as in PEM-Tropics A, indicate that convective mass outflux in the mid- dle and upper troposphere is largely independent of altitude over the tropical Pacific. Constraining a one-dimensional model with CH3I observations yields a 10-day timescale for convective turnover of the free troposphere, a factor of 2 faster than during PEM-Tropics A. Model simulated HO2, CH2O, H2O2, and CH3OOH concentrations are generally in agree- ment with observations. However, simulated OH concentrations are lower (~25%) than observations above 6 km. Whereas models tend to overestimate previous field measure- ments, simulated HNO3 concentrations during PEM-Tropics B are too low (a factor of 2-4 below 6 km) compared to observations. Budget analyses indicate that chemical production of O3 accounts for only 50% of chemical loss; significant transport of O3 into the region appears to take place within the tropics. Convective transport of CH3OOH enhances the production of HOx and O3 in the upper troposphere, but this effect is offset by HOx loss due to the scaveng- ing of H2O2. Convective transport and scavenging of reactive nitrogen species imply a necessary source of 0.4-1 Tg yr-1 of NOx in the free troposphere (above 4 km) over the trop- ics. A large fraction of the source could be from marine lightning. Oxidation of DMS transported by convection from the boundary layer could explain the observed free tropo- spheric SO2 concentrations over the tropical Pacific. This source of DMS due to convection, however, would imply in the model free tropospheric concentrations much higher than observed. The model overestimate cannot be reconciled using recent kinetics measurements of the DMS-OH adduct reaction at low pressures and temperatures and may reflect enhanced OH oxidation of DMS during convection.",

        "abstract": "Observations over the tropics from the Pacific Exploratory Mission-Tropics A Experiment are analyzed using a one-dimensional model with an explicit formulation for convective transport. Adopting tropical convective mass fluxes from a general circulation model (GCM) yields a large discrepancy between observed and simulated CH3I concentra- tions. Observations of CH3I imply the convective mass outflux to be more evenly distributed with altitude over the tropical ocean than suggested by the GCM. We find that using a uni- form convective turnover lifetime of 20 days in the upper and middle troposphere enables the model to reproduce CH3I observations. The model reproduces observed concentrations of H2O2 and CH3OOH. Convective transport of CH3OOH from the lower troposphere is esti- mated to account for 40-80% of CH3OOH concentrations in the upper troposphere. Photolysis of CH3OOH transported by convection more than doubles the primary HOx source and increases OH concentrations and O3 production by 10-50% and 0.4 ppbv d-1, respec- tively, above 11 km. Its effect on the OH concentration and O 3 production integrated over the tropospheric column is, however, small. The effects of pollutant import from biomass burn- ing regions are much more dominant. Using C2H2 as a tracer, we estimate that biomass burning outflow enhances O3 concentrations, O3 production, and concentrations of NOx and OH by 60%, 45%, 75%, and 7%, respectively. The model overestimates HNO3 concentra- tions by about a factor of 2 above 4 km for the upper one-third quantile of C 2H2 data while it generally reproduces HNO3 concentrations for the lower and middle one-third quantiles of C2H2 data.",

The model reproduces the observed NO2/NO concentration ratio to within 30% and has similar success in simulating observed concentrations of peroxides (H202, CH3OOH), lending confidence in its use to investigate ozone chemistry. It is found that chemical production of ozone balances only half of chemical loss in the tropospheric column over the tropical South Pacific. The net loss is 1.8 x 1011 molecules cm -2 S '1. The missing source of ozone is matched by west- erly transport of continental pollution into the region. Independent analysis of the regional ozone budget with a global three-dimensional model corroborates the results from the point model and reveals the importance of biomass burning emissions in South America and Africa for the ozone budget over the tropical South Pacific. In this model, biomass burning increases average ozone concentrations by 7-8 ppbv throughout the troposphere. The NOx responsible for ozone produc- tion within the South Pacific troposphere below 4 km can be largely explained by decomposition of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) transported into the region with biomass burning pollution at higher altitudes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Trace  gas  measurements  from  TRACE-P,  PEM-Tropics  B,  and  INTEX-NA  experiments,are  analyzed  to  examine ,the  major  source  factors  contributing  to  the ,observed  variabilities of  oxygenated ,volatile  organic  compounds ,and ,cyanides.  The  positive  matrix  factorization (PMF) is applied to coincidental measurements of 11 chemicals including CH3OH, CH3COCH3,  CH3CHO,  C2H2,  C2H6,  i-C5H12,  CO,  CH3Cl,  and  CHBr3.  Measurements  of  HCN  and CH3CN are available for TRACE-P and INTEX-NA.We identify major source contributions from terrestrial  biosphere,  biomass  burning,  industry/ubran  regions,  and  ocean.  While  source  separation is  fairly  clear  for  TRACE-P  and  PEM-Tropics  B  data,  PMF  cannot  resolve  source  contributions in  INTEX-NA  dataset  due  to  active  mixing ,processes  over  North  America  in  summer,and ,broad  collocations  of  different ,types ,of  sources ,in  the  region. ,Spatial  and  backtrajectory characteristics ofthese factors are examined. Large biomass burning contributions are found via long-range transport of aged air masses at high altitude. The biogenic contributions appear to result from dispersed continental sources. Industrial, urban, and oceanic concentrations clearly result from surface sources and transport. Based on TRACE-P and PEM-Tropics B data, wefind that the terrestrial biogenic factor explains 80\u201388% of the CH3OH variability, 20\u201340% ofCH3COCH3,  7\u201335%  of  CH3CHO,  and  41%  of  HCN.  The  biogenic  contribution  to  HCN  is  much,larger  than  previous  global  estimates.  Cyanogenesis  in  plants  is  likely  a  major ,emission",

        "abstract": "Inverse modeling using the Bayesian least squares method is applied to better constrain the sources and sinks of atmospheric methyl chloride (CH3Cl) using observations from seven surface stations and eight aircraft field experiments. We use a three-dimensional global chemical transport model, the GEOS-Chem, as the forward model. Up to 39 parameters describing the continental/hemispheric and seasonal dependence of the major sources of CH3Cl are used in the inversion. We find that the available surface and aircraft observations cannot constrain all the parameters, resulting in relatively large uncertainties in the inversion results. By examining the degrees of freedom in the inversion Jacobian matrix, we choose a reduced set of parameters that can be constrained by the observations while providing valuable information on the sources and sinks. In particular, we resolve the seasonal dependence of the biogenic and biomass-burning sources for each hemisphere. The in situ aircraft measurements are found to provide better constraints on the emission sources than surface measurements. The a posteriori emissions result in better agreement with the observations, particularly at southern high latitudes. The a posteriori biogenic and biomass-burning sources decrease by 13 and 11% to 2500 and 545 Gg yr\u22121, respectively, while the a posteriori net ocean source increases by about a factor of 2 to 761 Gg yr\u22121. The decrease in biomass-burning emissions is largely due to the reduction in the emissions in seasons other than spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The inversion results indicate that the biogenic source has a clear winter minimum in both hemispheres, likely reflecting the decrease of biogenic activity during that season.",

        "abstract": "A global three-dimensional model of tropospheric O3-NOx-hydrocarbon chemis- try is used to investigate the factors controlling ozone concentrations in the troposphere. Model results indicate a close balance between chemical production and chemical loss of ozone in the tropospheric column at all latitudes (except high latitudes in winter). Using sepa- rate tracers for ozone produced in the stratosphere and in different regions of the troposphere, we find that the contribution of transport from the stratosphere to ozone concentrations in the troposphere is about 30% at midlatitudes in winter, 10% in summer, and 5 % in the tropics. Production of ozone in the upper, middle, and continental lower troposphere all make signifi- cant contributions (10-50%) to ozone concentrations throughout the troposphere. The middle troposphere is a major global source region for ozone even though it is not a region of net production. The springtime maximum of ozone observed at remote sites in the northern extra- tropics is explained by a phase overlap between ozone transported from the stratosphere which peaks in late winter and ozone produced in the troposphere which peaks in late spring. Our model results do not support previous explanations of the springtime maximum based on wintertime accumulation of ozone or its precursors in the Arctic. The particularly strong springtime maximum at Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) is attributed to long-range trans- port of Asian pollution over the North Pacific in spring. A sensitivity simulation without nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) indicates small decreases of ozone concentrations (<15%) in the remote troposphere and a 20% increase in the global mean OH concentration. Without NMHCs as a source of peroxyacetylnitrate, concentrations of NOx decrease by 30% in the remote lower troposphere but increase by 70% in the continental lower troposphere and by 40% in the upper troposphere. Biogenic isoprene accounts for about half of the NMHC effects in the model.",

        "title": "Constraining global isoprene emissions with Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) formaldehyde column measurements",
        "abstract": "Biogenic isoprene plays an important role in tropospheric chemistry. Current isoprene emission estimates are highly uncertain because of a lack of direct observations. Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a high-yield product of isoprene oxidation. The short photochemical lifetime of HCHO allows the observation of this trace gas to help constrain isoprene emissions. We use HCHO column observations from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME). These global data are particularly useful for studying large isoprene emissions from the tropics, where in situ observations are sparse. Using the global Goddard Earth Observing System\u2013Chemistry (GEOS-CHEM) chemical transport model as the forward model, a Bayesian inversion of GOME HCHO observations from September 1996 to August 1997 is conducted to calculate global isoprene emissions. Column contributions to HCHO from 10 biogenic sources, in addition to biomass-burning and industrial sources, are considered. The inversion of these 12 HCHO sources is conducted separately for eight geographical regions (North America, Europe, east Asia, India, Southeast Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia). GOME measurements with high signal-to-noise ratios are used. The a priori simulation greatly underestimates global HCHO columns over the eight geographical regions (bias, \u221214 to \u221246%; R = 0.52\u20130.84). The a posteriori solution shows generally higher isoprene and biomass-burning emissions, and these emissions reduce the model biases for all regions (bias, \u22123.6 to \u221225%; R = 0.56\u20130.84). The negative bias in the a posteriori estimate reflects in part the uncertainty in GOME measurements. The a posteriori estimate of the annual global isoprene emissions of 566 Tg C yr\u22121 is \u223c50% larger than the a priori estimate. This increase of global isoprene emissions significantly affects tropospheric chemistry, decreasing the global mean OH concentration by 10.8% to 0.95 \u00d7 106 molecules/cm3. The atmospheric lifetime of CH3CCl3 increases from 5.2 to 5.7 years.",

Analysis of these observations and model results indicate that the enhancements are driven by a surge of trans-Pacific pollutant transport in late spring. The rapid seasonal transition is particularly striking for upper tropospheric NOx, resulting in large increases in photochemical oxidation and O3 production during the period. The transition is later in season than that of low-altitude trans-Pacific transport, which peak in March and April. The current generation of global chemical transport models clearly underestimates this long-range transport of pollutants, implying that the model-projected impact on regional air quality due to intercontinental pollution transport is also underestimated.",

The observed and simulated migrations of O3 and CO are in good agreement, demonstrating that the summer monsoon significantly affects the air quality over southeastern China, and this influence extends to central East China from June to July. Enhancements of CO and O3 over southeastern China disappear after the onset of the summer monsoon and reemerge in August after the monsoon wanes. The premonsoon high O3 concentrations over southern China are due to photochemical production from pollutant emissions and the O3 transport from the stratosphere. In the summer monsoon season, the O3 concentrations are relatively low over monsoon-affected regions because of the transport of marine air masses and weak photochemical activity. We find that the monsoon system strongly modulates the pollution problem over a large portion of East China in summer, depending on its strength and tempo-spatial extension. Model results also suggest that transport from the stratosphere and long-range transport from East China and South/central Asia all make significant contributions to O3 enhancements over West China. Satellite observations provide valuable information for investigating the monsoon impact on air quality, particularly for the regions with limited in situ measurements.",

        "title": "A study of tropospheric ozone column enhancements over North America using satellite data and a global chemical transport model",
        "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone columns (TCOs) have been calculated from the differences between the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Total Ozone Mapping System (TOMS) total ozone (level 2 version 3) and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounding (MLS) measurements of stratospheric ozone (version 2.2). These OMI-MLS TCOs were compared against ozonesonde measurements from the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX) Ozonesonde Network Study (IONS) campaign over North America in spring and summer, 2006. The OMI-MLS potential vorticity mapped TCOs are smaller than IONS TCOs by 5.9 DU (9.9 ppb when expressed as volume mixing ratio) with a standard deviation of the differences of 8.4 DU (14.4 ppb) and a standard error of the mean differences of approximately 0.5 DU (0.7 ppb). Compared to previously published versions, these OMI-MLS TCOs are an additional 2 DU smaller relative to ozonesonde measurements. The extra 2 DU arises from changes in OMI (\u223c\u22123 to \u22126 DU) and MLS (\u22121 to 3 DU), giving a net change of \u22122 DU. OMI-MLS TCOs derived using OMI Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) show similar differences in summer, but these TCOs are smaller than the sondes by only 2 DU (5 ppb) in spring. OMI-MLS TCOs derived from TOMS total ozone retrievals lead to better results when validated against IONS data, with less noise and a better seasonal consistency. Tropospheric ozone columns were also compared to those from GEOS-Chem model simulations in main distribution features. In the spring and summer of 2005 and 2006, the most dominant enhancement features are a tongue of enhancement stretching from around Yellow Sea northeastward into the Pacific and an enhancement band over the North America centered over the eastern United States and the adjacent ocean. The OMI-MLS TCO enhancements over the western Pacific and over the eastern United States increased from March to June and then decreased. In the GEOS-Chem model simulations, the monthly variation tendency is similar to that of satellite data over the west Pacific but the decrease tendency from June into August over eastern United States is less dramatic. A springtime TCO enhancement event of a few days duration over coastal California was investigated to demonstrate the ability of OMI-MLS mapped TCO columns in capturing ozone enhancements associated with stratospheric intrusions and trans-Pacific transport. Tagged ozone model simulations support the stratospheric contributions to the high TCOs over coastal California and over the Baja peninsula, and meteorological fields indicate that the stratospheric intrusions are associated with Rossby wave breaking events. Furthermore, back trajectory studies and comparisons of GEOS-Chem standard simulations and sensitivity runs with Asia anthropogenic emissions turned off provide evidence that the high tropospheric ozone columns over coastal California near Santa Barbara, California, has been influenced by cross-Pacific transport. Two-day-average maps of tropospheric ozone columns from Aura OMI-MLS TCOs also indicate cross-Pacific propagating features.",

        "abstract": "Column observations of NO2 by GOME and CO by MOPITT over North America and surrounding oceans for April 2000 are analyzed using a regional chemical transport model. Transient enhancements in these measurements due to lightning NOx production or convective transport are examined. Evidence is found for lightning enhancements of NO2 over the continent and western North Atlantic and for convective transport enhancements of CO over the ocean. The two independent satellite measurements show consistent enhancements related to convective events. Model results suggest that the enhancements are particularly large in the lower troposphere due to convective downdrafts of lightning NOx and shallow convection of CO, implying that low-altitude aircraft in situ observations are potentially critical for evaluating the model simulations and validating satellite observations of these transient features.",

Large enhancements of column and upper tropospheric O3 over the western North Atlantic comparable to those over the eastern United States are found in the satellite measurements and REAM simulations. The O3 enhancement region migrates northward from spring to summer. Model analysis indicates that the northward migration is driven by seasonal shifts of O3 transported from the stratosphere and that produced through photochemistry from surface emissions and lightning NOx. As their uncertainties improve, satellite measurements of O3 and its precursors will be able to provide more quantitative constraints on pollutant outflow from the continents.",

        "abstract": "Surface observations from AIRNow and Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Study networks, aircraft observations from the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In-Service Aircraft program, ozonesondes, and remote sensing measurements from Global Ozone Mapping Experiment, Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II for February\u2013May 2000 over North America are used to characterize the springtime transitions of O3 and its precursors. These measurements provide a comprehensive data set to evaluate the performance of the 3-D Regional Chemical Transport Model (REAM). The model is then applied to analyze the key factors affecting the springtime transitions of trace gas concentrations and export. The global GEOS-CHEM model is used to provide chemical initial and boundary conditions. Generally, the model results are in good agreement with the observations in the troposphere except for a low bias of upper tropospheric O3; the bias decreases toward the summer and lower latitudes. The rate of observed surface O3 increase in spring is simulated well by REAM. It is overestimated by GEOS-CHEM over the eastern United States. A key factor driving the model difference is daytime mixing depth. A shallow boundary layer in REAM leads to more efficient removal of radicals and hence slower activation of photochemistry in spring, when the primary radical source is relatively small. Comparison of top-down estimates of fossil fuel NOx emissions between REAM and GEOS-CHEM shows model dependence. The associated uncertainty is up to 20% on a monthly basis. Averaging over a season reduces this uncertainty. While tropospheric column NO2 decreases over the continent, it increases over the western North Atlantic due to lightning NOx production. Consequently, the REAM model simulates significant increases of tropospheric O3 over the region as indicated by column data derived from TOMS-SAGE II. Lightning impact is also evident in model-simulated NOx exports.",

        "abstract": "Airborne measurements of formaldehyde (CH2O) were acquired employing tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) during the 2000 Tropospheric Ozone Production About the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) study. This study consisted of seven deployments spanning the time period from 4 February to 23 May 2000 and covered a wide latitudinal band from 40\u00b0N to 85\u00b0N. The median measured CH2O concentrations, with a few exceptions, did not show any clear temporal trends from February to May in each of five altitude and three latitude bins examined. Detailed measurement\u2013model comparisons were carried out using a variety of approaches employing two different steady state models. Because recent emissions of CH2O and/or its precursors often result in model underpredictions, background conditions were identified using a number of chemical tracers. For background conditions at temperatures warmer than \u221245\u00b0C, the measurement\u2013model agreement on average ranged between \u221213% and +5% (measurement\u2013model/measurement), which corresponded to mean and median (measurement\u2013model) differences of 3 \u00b1 69 and \u22126 parts per trillion by volume (pptv), respectively. At very low temperatures starting at around \u221245\u00b0C, significant and persistent (measurement\u2013model) differences were observed from February to early April from southern Canada to the Arctic Ocean in the 6\u20138 km altitude range. In such cases, measured CH2O was as much as 392 pptv higher than modeled, and the median difference was 132 pptv (83%). Low light conditions as well as cold temperatures may be important in this effect. A number of possible mechanisms involving the reaction of CH3O2 with HO2 to produce CH2O directly were investigated, but in each case the discrepancy was only minimally reduced. Other possibilities were also considered but in each case there was no compelling evidence to support any of the hypotheses. Whatever the cause, the elevated CH2O concentrations significantly impact upper tropospheric HOx levels at high latitudes (>57\u00b0N) in the February\u2013April time frame.",

The required scavenging timescale to reconcile the model overestimates shows a rapid seasonal decrease down to 0.5-1 day in May, which cannot be explained by known mechanisms. This loss of H2O2 implies a large loss of HOx resulting in decreases in O3 production (10-20%) and OH concentrations (20-30%). Photolysis of CH2O, either transported into the region or produced by unknown chemical pathways, appears to provide a significant HOx source at 6-8 km at high latitudes. The rapid increase of in situ O3 production in spring is fueled by concurrent increases of the primary HOx production and NO concentrations. Long-lived reactive nitrogen species continue to accumulate at mid and high latitudes in spring. There is a net loss of NOx to HNO3 and PAN throughout the spring, suggesting that these long-term NOx reservoirs do not provide a net source for NOx in the region. In situ O3 chemical loss is dominated by the reaction of O3 and HO2, and not that of O( 1 D) and H2O. At midlatitudes, there is net in situ",

        "abstract": "Observations (0\u20138 km) from the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiment are analyzed to examine air masses contributing to the observed variability of springtime O3 and its seasonal increase at 40\u00b0\u201385\u00b0N over North America. Factor analysis using the positive matrix factorization and principal component analysis methods is applied to the data set with 14 chemical tracers (O3, NOy, PAN, CO, CH4, C2H2, C3H8, CH3Cl, CH3Br, C2Cl4, CFC-11, HCFC-141B, Halon-1211, and 7Be) and one dynamic tracer (potential temperature). Our analysis results are biased by the measurements at 5\u20138 km (70% of the data) due to the availability of 7Be measurements. The identified tracer characteristics for seven factors are generally consistent with the geographical origins derived from their 10 day back trajectories. Stratospherically influenced air accounts for 14 ppbv (35\u201340%) of the observed O3 variability for data with O3 concentrations <100 ppbv at middle and high latitudes. It accounts for about 2.5 ppbv/month (40%) of the seasonal O3 trend at midlatitudes but for only 0.8 ppbv/month (<20%) at high latitudes, likely reflecting more vigorous midlatitude dynamical systems in spring. At midlatitudes, reactive nitrogen-rich air masses transported through Asia are much more significant (11 ppbv in variability and 3.5 ppbv/month in trend) than other tropospheric contributors. At high latitudes the O3 variability is significantly influenced by air masses transported from lower latitudes (11 ppbv), which are poor in reactive nitrogen. The O3 trend, in contrast, is largely defined by air masses rich in reactive nitrogen transported through Asia and Europe across the Pacific or the Arctic (3 ppbv/month). The influence from the stratospheric source is more apparent at 6\u20138 km, while the effect of O3 production and transport within the troposphere is more apparent at lower altitudes. The overall effect of tropospheric photochemical production, through long-range transport, on the observed O3 variability and its seasonal trend is more important at high latitudes relative to more photochemically active midlatitudes.",

        "abstract": "Springtime near-surface ozone depletion has been observed at northern high latitudes. Due to limited observations, the spatial and temporal extent of low O3 concentrations near the surface is still unknown. A regional 3-D chemistry and transport model is applied to simulate surface O3 depletion catalyzed by bromine radicals at northern high latitudes in March and April 2000. Satellite observations of BrO column by the ESA Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) were processed to specify the BrO concentrations in the lower troposphere. In view of the GOME measurement and model uncertainties, the model results show an adequate agreement with the O3 depletion events observed at two surface sites, Alert, Canada (82.5\u00b0N, 62.3\u00b0W) and Barrow, Alaska (71.3\u00b0N, 156.6\u00b0W), and by airborne in situ and DIAL instrument during the TOPSE experiments at northern high latitudes. Low O3 events at Alert appear to be mostly driven by transport of O3-poor air from high BrO regions. Model results indicate that low O3 concentrations (<20 ppbv) near the surface cover \u223c60% of the northern high latitudes and that the depleted O3 concentrations (<10 ppbv) cover \u223c20% of the region in April. The high BrO events tend to be large-scale and persistent (1\u20132 weeks). We find that they are correlated with low temperature, a condition conducive for heterogeneous reactions on frozen snow or aerosol surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Halogen-driven ozone and hydrocarbon losses in springtime Arctic boundary layer are investigated using a regional chemical transport model. Surface observations of ozone at Alert and Barrow and aircraft observations of ozone and hydrocarbons during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiment from February to May in 2000 are analyzed. We prescribe halogen radical distributions on the basis of GOME BrO observations. Tropospheric GOME BrO column shows an apparent anticorrelation with surface temperature over high-BrO regions. The enhancements of tropospheric BrO columns coincide with movements of cold polar air masses. While GOME BrO measurements reach the maximum in March, simulated near-surface ozone loss peaks in April because of the increasing daylight hours and hence the time for chemical processing. At its peak, the area of simulated near-surface ozone depletions (O3 50% of the northern high latitudes. Analysis of surface measurements at Alert and Barrow points to the importance of long-range transport of ozone-poor air from high-BrO regions. We find that specifying a BrO layer thickness of 300 m results in the best overall agreement between observed and simulated ozone. The apparent halogen-driven ozone loss up to 1 km was reproduced in the model because of vertical transport of ozone-poor air from low altitudes. When the empirical Cl/Br ratios derived from previous observations are used, the model can reproduce the observed halogen loss of light alkanes and acetylene. The Cl/Br ratios from a recent box model study using an accepted chemical mechanism are, however, much higher than the empirical results. We show that the hydrocarbon loss is not as sensitive to the prescribed thickness of the halogen layer as the ozone loss, therefore representing a more robust measure for evaluating satellite BrO column measurements.",

        "abstract": "Results from a global three-dimensional model for tropospheric O3-NOx-hydro- carbon chemistry are presented and evaluated with surface, ozonesonde, and aircraft measurements. Seasonal variations and regional distributions of ozone, NO, peroxyacetylni- trate (PAN), CO, ethane, acetone, and H20 2 are examined. The model reproduces observed NO and PAN concentrations to within a factor of 2 for a wide range of tropospheric regions including the upper troposphere but tends to overestimate HNO3 concentrations in the remote troposphere (sometimes several fold). This discrepancy implies a missing sink for HNO 3 that does not lead to rapid recycling of NOx; only in the upper troposphere over the tropical South Atlantic would a fast conversion of HNO3 to NOx improve the model simulation for NOx. Observed concentrations of acetone are reproduced in the model by including a large bio- genic source (15 Tg C yr-\u007f), which accounts for 40% of the estimated global source of acetone (37 Tg C yr-\u007f). Concentrations of H20 2 in various regions of the troposphere are sim- ulated usually to within a factor of 2, providing a test for HOx chemistry in the model. The model reproduces well the observed concentrations and seasonal variations of ozone in the troposphere, with some exceptions including an underestimate of the vertical gradient across the tropical trade wind inversion. A global budget analysis in the model indicates that the supply and loss of tropospheric ozone are dominated by photochemistry within the tropo- sphere and that NOx emitted in the southern hemisphere is twice as efficient at producing ozone as NOx emitted in the northern hemisphere. model for the simulation of tropospheric O3-NOx-hydrocarbon chem- istry. We present here an evaluation of model results for ozone, reactive nitrogen oxides, CO, ethane, acetone, and H202 with observations in different regions of the troposphere. This extensive evaluation provides the basis for using the model to investigate global and regional budgets of tropospheric ozone in a second companion paper (Wang et al., this issue(b)). It also provides important constraints on our understanding of tropospheric ozone chemistry. The model is driven by meteorological fields from a general circulation model (GCM) developed at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Hansen et al., 1983). It has a spatial resolu- tion of 4 \u00f8 latitude by 5 \u00f8 longitude, with seven vertical layers extending from the surface to 150 mbar. Meteorological fields are updated every 4 hours. Spatially and temporally varying cross-tropopause fluxes of ozone, NOx, and HNO3 are speci- fied as upper boundary conditions at 150 mbar. The model transports 15 tracers including odd oxygen (Ox = 03 + O + NO2 + HNO4 + 2 x NO3 + 3 x N205), NOx (NO + NO2 + NO3 + HNO2), N205, HNO3, HNO4, peroxyacylnitrates, alkylni-",

        "abstract": "A global three-dimensional model of tropospheric chemistry is used to investigate the changes in tropospheric 03 and OH since preindustrial times as a result of fuel combus- tion and industry, biomass burning, and growth in atmospheric CH 4. Model results indicate a 63% increase of the global tropospheric 03 burden from preindustrial times to present (80% and 50% in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively). Anthropogenic emissions of NOx and of CO and hydrocarbons make comparable contributions to the global 03 increase (60% and 40% respectively), even though the local rate of tropospheric 03 produc- tion is generally NOx limited. The rise in 03 production parallels closely the rise in the emissions of CO and hydrocarbon because the 03 yield per mole of CO or hydrocarbon oxi- dized has remained constant at 0.7-0.8 mol/mol since preindustrial times. In contrast, the 03 production efficiency per mole of NOx emitted has decreased globally by a factor of 2. We find a 9% decrease in the global mean OH concentration (mass-weighted) since preindustrial times. A linear relationship is found in the model between the global mean OH concentration and the SN/Sc 3/2 ratio, where Sv and Sc are the sources of NOx and of CO and hydrocarbons, respectively. The relative constancy of the global mean OH concentration since preindustrial times reflects the conservation of the SN/Sc 3/2 ratio despite large increases in both Sv and Sc. Comparisons of model results with reconstructed nineteenth century observations of 03 at continental sites indicate a systematic overestimate of about 5 ppbv. Correcting this overesti- mate would require either a large missing chemical sink for 03 or a downward revision of the natural NOx source from lightning (3 Tg N yr -1 in our model). The nineteenth century obser- vations of 03 over France show no vertical gradient between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, which is inconsistent with our current understanding of tropospheric 03. The model underestimates preindustrial CO concentrations derived from polar ice cores; these measurements are difficult to reconcile with any reasonable CO emission inventories.",

        "abstract": "A three-dimensional, continental-scale photochemical model is used to investigate seasonal budgets of 03 and NO3. species (including NOx and its oxidation products) in the boundary layer over the United States and to estimate the export of these species from the U.S. boundary layer to the global atmosphere. Model results are evaluated with year-round observations for 03, CO, and NO\u007f, species at nonurban sites. A seasonal transition from NO,\u007f to hydrocarbon-limited conditions for 03 production over the eastern United States is found to take place in the fall, with the reverse transition taking place in the spring. The mean NOx/NOy molar ratio in the U.S. boundary layer in the model ranges from 0.2 in summer to 0.6 in winter, in accord with observations, and reflecting largely the seasonal variation in the chemical lifetime of NOx. Formation of hydroxy organic nitrates during oxidation of isoprene, followed by decomposition of these nitrates to HNO 3, is estimated to account for 30% of the chemical sink of NOx in the U.S. boundary layer in summer. Model results indicate that peroxyacylnitrates (PANs) are most abundant in the U.S. boundary layer in spring (25% of total NO3.), reflecting a combination of active photochemistry and low temperatures. About 20% of the NOx emitted from fossil fuel combustion in the United States in the model is exported out of the U.S. boundary layer as NOx or PANs (15% in summer, 25% in winter). This export responds less than proportionally to changes in NOx emissions in summer, but more than proportionally in winter. The annual mean export of NOx and PANs from the U.S. boundary layer is estimated to be 1.4 Tg N yr -\u007f , representing an important source of NOx on the scale of the northern hemisphere troposphere. The eventual 03 production in the global troposphere due to the exported NOx and PANs is estimated to be twice as large, on an annual basis, as the direct export of 03 pollution from the U.S. boundary layer. Fossil fuel combustion in the United States is estimated to account for about 10% of the total source of 03 in the northern hemisphere troposphere on an annual basis.",

A suite of 15 chemical tracers, including O 3, NOx, PAN, HNO3, CO, H2O2, and various hydrocarbons, is simulated in the model. For com- putational expediency, chemical production and loss of tracers are parameterized as polynomial functions to fit the results of a detailed O 3-NOx-hydrocarbon mechanism. The model includes state-of-the-art inventories of anthropogenic emissions and process-based for- mulations of natural emissions and deposition that are tied to the model meteorology. Improvements are made to existing schemes for computing biogenic emissions of isoprene and NO. Our best estimates of global emissions include among others 42 Tg N yr -1 for NOx (21 Tg N yr-1 from fossil fuel combustion, 12 Tg N yr -1 from biomass burning, 6 Tg N yr-1 from soils, and 3 Tg N yr-1 from lightning), and 37 Tg C yr -1 for acetone (1 Tg C yr-1 from industry, 9 Tg C yr-1 from biomass burning, 15 Tg C yr-1 from vegetation, and 12 Tg C yr-1 from oxidation of propane and higher alkanes).",

The daytime average OH, HO2, and RO2 concentrations were 2.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106, 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009108, and 5.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009107\u2009molecules\u2009cm\u22123, respectively. The average daytime O3 production rate was 8.8\u2009ppbv\u2009h\u22121, and alkenes were the most important VOC species for O3 formation (contributing 45%) at this site. Our sensitivity test indicated that the atmospheric environment in Wuhan during autumn belongs to the VOC-limited regime. The daily average HONO concentration at this site during the study period reached 1.1\u2009ppbv and played an important role in the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. Without the source of excess HONO, the average daytime OH, HO2, RO2, and O3 production rates decreased by 36%, 26%, 27%, and 31% respectively. A correlation between the HONO to NO2 heterogeneous conversion efficiency and PM2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009SWR was found at this site; based on this relationship, if the PM2.5 concentration met the World Health Organization air quality standard (25\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123), the O3 production rate in this city would decrease by 19% during late autumn. The burning of agricultural biomass severely affected the air quality in Wuhan during summer and autumn. Agricultural burning was found to account for 18% of the O3 formation during the study period. Our results suggest that VOC control and a ban on agricultural biomass burning should be considered as high-priority measures for improving the air quality in this region.",

        "abstract": "Fire frequency, extent, and size exhibit a strong linkage with climate conditions and play a vital role in the climate system. Previous studies have shown that the frequency of large fires in the western United States increased significantly since the mid-1980s due to climate warming and frequent droughts. However, less work has been conducted to examine burned area and fire emissions of large fires at a national scale, and the underlying mechanisms accounting for the increases in the frequency of large fires are far from clear. In this study, we integrated remote-sensed fire perimeter and burn severity data sets into the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model to estimate carbon emissions from large fires (i.e., fires with size larger than 1000\u2009acres or 4.05\u2009km2) in conterminous United States from 1984 to 2012. The results show that average area burned by large fires was 1.44\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u2009km2\u2009yr\u22121 and carbon emissions from large fires were 17.65\u2009Tg\u2009C\u2009yr\u22121 during the study period. According to the Mann-Kendall trend test, annual burned area and pyrogenic carbon emissions presented significant upward trends at the rates of 810\u2009km2\u2009yr\u22121 and 0.87\u2009Tg\u2009C\u2009yr\u22121, respectively. Characteristic fire size (fire size with the largest contribution to the total burned area) in the period of 2004\u20132012 increased by 176.1% compared to the period of 1984\u20131993. We further found that the larger fires were associated with higher burn severity and occurred more frequently in the warmer and drier conditions. This finding implies that the continued warming and drying trends in the 21st century would enhance the total burned area and fire emissions due to the contributions of larger and more severe wildfires.",

        "abstract": "The Pacific Atmospheric Sulfur Experiment (PASE) is the first sulfur-budget field experiment to feature simultaneous flux measurements of DMS marine emissions and SO deposition to the ocean surface. We make use of these data to constrain a 1-D chemical transport model to study the production and loss pathways for DMS and SO over the equatorial Pacific. Model results suggest that OH is the main sink for DMS in the boundary layer (BL), and the average DMS-to-SO conversion efficiency is ~73%. In an exploratory run involving the addition of 1 pptv of BrO as a second oxidant, a 14% increase in the DMS flux is needed beyond that based on OH oxidation alone. This BrO addition also reduces the DMS-to-SO conversion efficiency from 73% to 60%. The possibility of non-DMS sources of marine sulfur influencing the estimated conversion efficiency was explored and found to be unconvincing. For BL conditions, SO losses consist of 48% dry deposition, while transport loss to the BuL and aerosol scavenging each account for another 19%. The conversion of SO to HSO consumes the final 14%. In the BuL, cloud scavenging removes 85% of the SO, thus resulting in a decreasing vertical profile for SO. The average SO dry deposition velocity from direct measurements (i.e., 0.36\u00a0cm\u2009sec) is approximately 50% of what is calculated from the 1-D model and the global GEOS-Chem model. This suggests that the current generation of global models may be significantly overestimating SO deposition rates over some tropical marine areas. Although the specific mechanism cannot be determined, speculation here is that the dry deposition anomalous results may point to the presence of a micro-surface chemical phenomenon involving partial saturation with either S(IV) and/or S(VI) DMS oxidation products. This could also appear as a pH drop in the ocean\u2019s surface microfilm layer in this region. Finally, we propose that the enhanced SO level observed in the lower free troposphere versus that in the upper BuL during PASE is most likely the result of transported DMS/SO-rich free-tropospheric air parcels from the east of the PASE sampling area, rather than an inadequate representation in the model of local convection.",

        "title": "Pacific Atmospheric Sulfur Experiment (PASE): dynamics and chemistry of the south Pacific tropical trade wind regime",
        "abstract": "The Pacific Atmospheric Sulfur Experiment (PASE) was a comprehensive airborne study of the chemistry and dynamics of the tropical trade wind regime (TWR) east of the island of Kiritibati (Christmas Island, 157\u00ba, 20\u2032 W, 2\u00ba 52\u2032 N). Christmas Island is located due south of Hawaii. Geographically it is in the northern hemisphere yet it is 6\u201312\u00ba south of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) which places it in the southern hemisphere meteorologically. Christmas Island trade winds in August and September are from east south east at 3\u201315\u00a0ms. Clouds, if present, are fair weather cumulus located in the middle layer of the TWR which is frequently labeled the buffer layer (BuL). PASE provided clear support for the idea that small particles (80\u00a0nm) were subsiding into the tropical trade wind regime (TWR) where sulfur chemistry transformed them to larger particles. Sulfur chemistry promoted the growth of some of these particles until they were large enough to activate to cloud drops. This process, promoted by sulfur chemistry, can produce a cooling effect due to the increase in cloud droplet density and changes in cloud droplet size. These increases in particle size observed in PASE promote additional cooling due to direct scattering from the aerosol. These potential impacts on the radiation balance in the TWR are enhanced by the high solar irradiance and ocean albedo of the TWR. Finally because of the large area involved there is a large factional impact on earth\u2019s radiation budget. The TWR region near Christmas Island appears to be similar to the TWR that persists in August and September, from southwest of the Galapagos to at least Christmas Island. Transport in the TWR between the Galapagos and Christmas involves very little precipitation which could have removed the aerosol thus explaining at least in part the high concentrations of CCN (\u2248300 at 0.5% supersaturation) observed in PASE. As expected the chemistry of sulfur in the trade winds was found to be initiated by the emission of DMS into the convective boundary layer (BL, the lowest of three layers). However, the efficiency with which this DMS is converted to SO has been brought into further question by this study. This unusual result has come about as result of our using two totally different approaches for addressing this long standing question. In the first approach, based on accepted kinetic rate constants and detailed steps for the oxidation of DMS reflecting detailed laboratory studies, a DMS to SO conversion efficiency of 60\u201373% was determined. This range of values lies well within the uncertainties of previous studies. However, using a completely different approach, involving a budget analysis, a conversion value of 100% was estimated. The latter value, to be consistent with all other sulfur studies, requires the existence of a completely independent sulfur source which would emit into the atmosphere at a source strength approximately half that measured for DMS under tropical Pacific conditions. At this time, however, there is no credible scientific observation that identifies what this source might be. Thus, the current study has opened for future scientific investigation the major question: is there yet another major tropical marine source of sulfur? Of equal importance, then, is the related question, is our global sulfur budget significantly in error due to the existence of an unknown marine source of sulfur? Pivotal to both questions may be gaining greater insight about the intermediate DMS oxidation species, DMSO, for which rather unusual measurements have been reported in previous marine sulfur studies. The 3 pptv bromine deficit observed in PASE must be lost over the lifetime of the aerosol which is a few days. This observation suggests that the primary BrO production rate is very small. However, considering the uncertainties in these observations and the possible importance of secondary production of bromine radicals through aerosol surface reactions, to completely rule out the importance of bromine chemistry under tropical conditions at this time cannot be justified. This point has been brought into focus from prior work that even at levels of 1\u00a0pptv, the effect of BrO oxidation on DMS can still be quite significant. Thus, as in the case of DMS conversion to SO, future studies will be needed. In the latter case there will need to be a specific focus on halogen chemistry. Such studies clearly must involve specific measurements of radical species such as BrO.",

        "abstract": "An often used assumption in air pollution studies is a well-mixed boundary layer (BL), where pollutants are evenly distributed. Because of the difficulty in obtaining vertically resolved measurements, the validity of the assumption has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we usemore than 200 vertical profiles observed in the Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) aircraft campaign in July 2011 to examine the vertical distributions of pollutants over the Washington-Baltimore area. While many long-lived species are well mixed in daytime, the observed average vertical profile of NOx shows a large negative gradient with increasing altitude in the BL. Our analysis suggests that the magnitude of the NOx gradient is highly sensitive to atmospheric stability. We investigate how parameterizations of the BL and land-surface processes impact vertical profiles in a 1-D chemical transport model, using three BL schemes (Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2), Yonsei University (YSU), and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ)) and two land-surface schemes (Noah and Rapid Update Cycle (RUC)). The model reasonably reproduces the median vertical profiles of NOx under different BL stability conditions within 30% of observations, classified based on potential temperature gradient and BL height. Comparisons with NOx observations for individual vertical profiles reveal that while YSU performs better in the turbulent and deep BL case, in general, ACM2 (RMSE=2.0ppbv) outperforms YSU (RMSE=2.5ppbv) and MYJ (RMSE=2.2ppbv). Results also indicate that the land-surface schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model have a small impact on the NOx gradient. Usingmodel simulations, we analyze the impact of BL NOx gradient on the calculation of the ozone production rate and satellite NO2 retrieval. We show that using surface measurements and the well-mixed BL assumption causes a~45%highbias in the estimated BL ozoneproduction rate and that the variability of NO2 vertical profiles is responsible for 5\u201310% variability in the retrieved NO2 tropospheric vertical columns.",

        "abstract": "Strong correlation between O3 and CO was observed during the Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) aircraft experiment in July 2011 over the Washington-Baltimore area. The observed correlation does not vary significantly with time or altitude in the boundary layer. The observations are simulated well by a regional chemical transport model. We analyze the model results to understand the factors contributing to the observed O3-CO regression slope, which has been used in past studies to estimate the anthropogenic O3 production amount. We trace separately four different CO sources: primary anthropogenic emissions, oxidation of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds, oxidation of biogenic isoprene, and transport from the lateral and upper model boundaries. Modeling analysis suggests that the contribution from biogenic isoprene oxidation to the observed O3-CO regression slope is as large as that from primary anthropogenic CO emissions. As a result of decrease of anthropogenic primary CO emissions during the past decades, biogenic CO from oxidation of isoprene is increasingly important. Consequently, observed and simulated O3-CO regression slopes can no longer be used directly with an anthropogenic CO emission inventory to quantify anthropogenic O3 production over the United States. The consistent enhancement of O3 relative to CO observed in the boundary layer, as indicated by the O3-CO regression slope, provides a useful constraint on model photochemistry and emissions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) have often been used to derive nitrogen oxides (NO  x  \u2009=\u2009  NO  +  NO 2 ) emissions. A widely used inversion method was developed by Martin et al.\u00a0(2003). Refinements of this method were subsequently developed. In the context of this inversion method, we show that the local derivative (of a first-order Taylor expansion) is more appropriate than the \u201cbulk ratio\u201d (ratio of emission to column) used in the original formulation for polluted regions. Using the bulk ratio can lead to biases in regions of high NO  x   emissions such as eastern China due to chemical non-linearity. Inverse modelling using the local derivative method is applied to both GOME-2 and OMI satellite measurements to estimate anthropogenic NO  x   emissions over eastern China. Compared with the traditional method using bulk ratio, the local derivative method produces more consistent NO  x   emission estimates between the inversion results using GOME-2 and OMI measurements. The results also show significant changes in the spatial distribution of NO  x   emissions, especially over high emission regions of eastern China. We further discuss a potential pitfall of using the difference of two satellite measurements to derive NO  x   emissions. Our analysis suggests that chemical non-linearity needs to be accounted for and that a careful bias analysis is required in order to use the satellite differential method in inverse modelling of NO  x   emissions.",

        "abstract": "Assimilated inversion on a daily basis using OMI tropospheric NO2 columns is developed and applied in a regional chemical transport model (REAM) to constrain fossil fuel (FF) NOx emissions over east Asia in 2007. The iterative nature of the assimilated inversion improves upon the widely used monthly-mean inversion by accounting for the chemical feedbacks of changed NOx emissions and reducing the dependence of the a priori emissions. The assimilated a posteriori emissions from FF combustion over east Asia are 9.5 Tg N/yr comparable to 10.9 Tg N/yr of the a priori. Significant changes in the spatial distribution of FF NOx emissions are found in the assimilated inversion from the a priori or monthly-mean inversion. The assimilated inversion shows that the a priori FF NOx emission inventory tends to overestimate the emissions over the economically developed areas and underestimate over the underdeveloped areas in East China, which may reflect in part FF NOx emission reductions resulting from the urban-centric air quality controls in China.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the observations of near-surface peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) and its precursors in Beijing, China in August of 2007. The levels of PAN are remarkably high (up to 14 ppbv), surpassing those measured over other urban regions in recent years. Analyses employing a 1-D version of a chemical transport model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model, REAM) indicate that aromatic non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) are the dominant (55-75%) PAN source. The major oxidation product of aromatics that produces acetyl peroxy radicals is methylglyoxal (MGLY). PAN and O(3) in the observations are correlated at daytime; aromatic NMHCs appear to play an important role in O(3) photochemistry. Previous NMHC measurements indicate the presence of reactive aromatics at high levels over broad polluted regions of China. Aromatics are often ignored in global and (to a lesser degree) regional 3D photochemical transport models; their emissions over China as well as photochemistry are quite uncertain. Our findings suggest that critical assessments of aromatics emissions and chemistry (such as the yields of MGLY) are necessary to understand and assess ozone photochemistry and regional pollution export in China.",

This paper presents the derivation of HO2 from observations of HO2NO2 and NO2 in metropolitan Atlanta, US, in winter 2014 and summer 2015. HO2 was observed to have a diurnal cycle with morning concentrations suppressed by high NO from the traffic. At night, derived HO2 levels were nonzero and exhibited correlations with O3 and NO3, consistent with previous studies that ozonolysis and oxidation by NO3 are sources of nighttime HO2. Measured and model calculated HO2 were in reasonable agreement: Without the constraint of measured HO2NO2, the model reproduced HO2 with a model-to-observed ratio (M/O) of 1.27 (r = 0.54) for winter, 2014, and 0.70 (r = 0.80) for summer, 2015. Adding measured HO2NO2 as a constraint, the model predicted HO2 with M/O = 1.13 (r = 0.77) for winter 2014 and 0.90 (r = 0.97) for summer 2015. These results demonstrate the f...",

        "abstract": "Prescribed burning is a large aerosol source in the southeastern United States. Its air quality impact is investigated using 3-D model simulations and analysis of ground and satellite observations. Fire emissions for 2002 are calculated based on a recently developed VISTAS emission inventory. March was selected for the investigation because it is the most active prescribed fire month. Inclusion of fire emissions significantly improved model performance. Model results show that prescribed fire emissions lead to approximately 50% enhancements of mean OC and EC concentrations in the Southeast and a daily increase of PM2.5 up to 25 microg m(-3), indicating that fire emissions can lead to PM2.5 nonattainment in affected regions. Surface enhancements of CO up to 200 ppbv are found. Fire count measurements from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the NASA Terra satellite show large springtime burning in most states, which is consistent with the emission inventory. These measurements also indicate that the inventory may underestimate fire emissions in the summer.",

        "title": "Duplex DLC coatings fabricated on the inner surface of a tube using plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition",
        "abstract": "A duplex plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID) process, involving carbon ion implantation and diamond-like carbon (DLC) deposition, is proposed to modify the inner surface of a tube. In the research, samples of GCr15 bearing steel were placed inside a tube in the vacuum chamber. After the vacuum chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 6 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 \u00a0Pa, C 2 H 2 gas was introduced into the chamber, and the tube was biased by a negative pulsed bias. Since a pulsed glow discharge (PGD) plasma can be formed by the bias, carbon ion implantation and DLC film deposition process can be obtained by biasing the tube with a high and low bias, respectively. To synthesize different DLC films, single PIIID processes employing a low voltage (several kV) PGD method and duplex PIIID processes combining the high (several tens kV) and low voltage PGD techniques were carried out. The as-synthesized films were characterized by Raman spectrum, nano-indentation, scratch, tribological and electrochemical tests. Raman results show that duplex DLC films were synthesized by this duplex PIIID process. In addition, compared with the single DLC film synthesized by the low voltage PGD process, the duplex DLC films can obtain a high wear and corrosion resistances. Furthermore, using this duplex PIIID method, batch treatment of outer-rings of the bearing was realized. Keywords Plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition Tube Duplex Diamond-like carbon 1 Introduction Under some severe operational and lubricating conditions, the bearing is often the key component that determines the lifetime and performance of a mechanical system. To improve the lifetime of the bearing, many surface modification methods were proposed. However, for the outer-ring of a bearing, since the contact surface is the inner one, it is difficult to realize its surface modification. In a plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID) process, a target is immersed in the plasma and ions are accelerated by the bias applied on the target. When the ion energy is high, the ion is implanted into the surface, leading to an implantation process. When the ion energy is low, a film can be formed on the surface, and this process belongs to a deposition process [1\u20133] . PIIID can be used to modify the inner surface of a tube. X. C. Zeng proposed setting an auxiliary electrode along the axis of the cylindrical tube to increase the ion impact energy [4] . However, this method can not solve the problems of low implantation dose and energy. Grid-enhanced plasma source ion implantation (GEPSII) adapted a coaxial electrode and grid structure to generate plasma inside a tube [5] . However, for a small tube, in order to avoid arcing between the grid and the wall of the tube, the implantation voltage can not be high enough. Ronghua Wei proposed a new inner surface modification method called plasma immersion ion deposition (PIID) [6] . Using this method, the plasma can be generated inside the tube by applying a negative pulsed voltage (several kV), and the diamond-like carbon (DLC) film could be fabricated using CH 4 or C 2 H 2 as the working gas. The advantage of this method is that the setup is simple and many tubes can be deposited simultaneously, but the adhesion strength of DLC film is not good. In order to improve the adhesion strength, a duplex PIIID process combing carbon ion implantation and DLC film deposition was proposed to strengthen the inner surface of a tube. The influences of processing parameters on structure, wear and corrosion resistances of the as-deposited DLC films were studied. In addition, batch processing of the outer-rings of the bearing was realized by this duplex PIIID method. 2 Experimental The experimental details are shown in Fig. 1 . The vacuum chamber has the diameter of 1.0\u00a0m and the height of 1.2\u00a0m. A target holder with the diameter of 150\u00a0mm locates in the center of the vacuum chamber. The target holder is insulated from the vacuum chamber by a ceramic tube, and the bias can be introduced to the target holder by a metal rod in the ceramic tube. A cylindrical tube with a diameter of 60\u00a0mm and a length of 100\u00a0mm was installed horizontally on the target holder. To evaluate the performances of the coatings, samples of GCr15 bearing steel (composition listed in Table 1 ) were set on the inner surface of the tube. The size of the samples was 6 \u00d7 6\u00a0mm, and the thickness was 0.5\u00a0mm. Before treatment, the samples received a final polish to a surface roughness, Ra, of 0.04\u00a0\u03bcm, and were cleaned ultrasonically in acetone and ethanol. During the experiment, the vacuum chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 6 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 \u00a0Pa. The C 2 H 2 gas was introduced into the chamber by a mass flow meter. Two kind of pulse modulators were used in our research. One based on the hard tube technique can generate a 5\u201340\u00a0kV and 1\u2013400\u00a0Hz pulsed bias, another one based on the serial IGBTs technique can obtain a 1\u20134\u00a0kV and 1\u201310\u00a0kHz pulsed bias. As we know, when the pressure is proper and the magnitude of the pulsed bias on the substrate is high enough, breakdown will take place and plasma can be generated. Since the plasma can maintain several microseconds after the pulse is off, when the pulse repetition frequency is large enough, glow discharge can be formed in the next pulse without the former breakdown process [7\u20139] . Therefore, a pulsed glow discharge (PGD) plasma can be formed in the inner surface when the applied voltage and the frequency are high enough. In addition, because the potential of the PGD plasma is nearly the same as that of the anode [10] , an ion sheath will be formed between the plasma and the inner surface (cathode). Consequently, the ions in the sheath will be accelerated by the potential difference of the ion sheath. When the magnitude is several kV, ion bombardment will take place and the DLC structure will be formed by this method [6] . When the magnitude of the applied voltage is larger than 20\u00a0kV, carbon ion implantation will take place in the pulse-on period [11] . Typical inner surface PIIID parameters using the low voltage PGD method were: pulse width = 20\u00a0\u03bcs; C 2 H 2 gas flow = 80\u00a0sccm; working pressure = 2\u00a0Pa, and deposition time = 2\u00a0h. The magnitude and frequency of the bias were varied from 2 to 4\u00a0kV and 2 to 8\u00a0kHz, respectively. In addition, in order to obtain a high adhesion strength DLC layer on the sample, duplex PIIID processes combining high and low voltage PGD techniques were also conducted in this research. The parameters for high voltage PGD process were: pulse width = 60\u00a0\u03bcs; C 2 H 2 gas flow = 40\u00a0sccm; working pressure =6 \u00d7 10 \u2212 1 \u00a0Pa, and pulse frequency = 350\u00a0Hz. The implantation voltage and time were changed from 20 to 30\u00a0kV and 0.5 to 2.0\u00a0h, respectively. The detailed process parameters for each sample are listed in Table 2 . Structural analysis of the as-deposited DLC layers was performed by Raman spectrum. The friction coefficient was measured on a ball-on-disk wear tester equipped with a Si 3 N 4 ball of 6.3\u00a0mm in diameter. All samples were tested using a load of 100\u00a0g and a sliding speed of 1 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 \u00a0m/s. Furthermore, for some samples, the wear test with the load of 400\u00a0g were also carried out. A nano-indentation was used to obtain the nano hardness of each sample, and the load applied on the sample was 50\u00a0\u03bcN. Polarization curves were measured in 3.5% NaCl solution to evaluate the corrosion properties of the samples. Scratch tests were conducted using a scratching speed of 2\u00a0mm/min and a loading rate of 40\u00a0N/min. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Single DLC film For the single DLC layer fabricated by this inner surface PIIID technique, the dependences of the wear resistance on the magnitude and frequency of the pulsed bias are shown in Fig. 2 a and b . It can be seen that the wear resistance increases with the repetition frequency and the magnitude of the pulsed bias. The as-deposited DLC film with the pulse voltage of 4\u00a0kV and pulse frequency of 8\u00a0kHz (sample S5) obtained the best wear resistance. The Raman spectrum of sample S5 is shown in Fig. 3 a . The peak with a shoulder in the range of 1300\u20131600\u00a0cm \u2212 1 insures the formation of a DLC structure. According to the spectrum, the I D / I G value of this sample is 1.26, which indicates that the as-synthesized DLC film has a high content of sp 3 bonding. Moreover, the nano-indentation test shows that the nano hardness of this DLC film reach 13.4\u00a0GPa, which also prove the film has a high content of diamond structure. Fig. 4 a shows the photograph of the single DLC layer (sample S5) after scratch test. It can be seen that serious wrinkles were formed in the film near the scratch track. In addition, obvious delamination has taken place in the track. These all imply that the adhesion strength of the single DLC layer is poor. 3.2 Duplex DLC films Raman spectrum of the film after carbon ion implantation using the high voltage PGD method (sample S6) is shown in Fig. 3 b. It can be seen that DLC structure is also formed on the surface layer. Since the I D / I G value is not the same as that in the film by a small pulsed bias, the duplex PIIID process employing the high and low voltage PGD methods can obtain a duplex DLC films on the sample. Because the fabrication of the duplex DLC films employed a carbon ion implantation process, the adhesion strength of the duplex DLC films should be improved. Compared with the result of the single DLC layer, except some delamination, none wrinkle can be found near the scratch track of the duplex DLC films (sample S9), as shown in Fig. 4 b. Furthermore, there is no spalling in the track. This result indicates that a duplex PIIID process can increase the adhesion strength of the DLC film. Fig. 5 compares the friction curves of the single and duplex DLC films (sample S5 and S9). Compared with the single DLC layer, the cut-through number of the duplex DLC films is increased by about 10 times and the friction coefficient is decreased from 0.15\u20130.18 to 0.08\u20130.12. From the result of nano-indentation test, we find that the surface hardness of the sample is increased from 7.61 to 12.35\u00a0GPa after the carbon ion implantation. Therefore, for the duplex DLC films, the initial carbon ion implantation process can offer a supporting layer for the external DLC film and increase the load bearing capacity. In addition, in the duplex DLC films, the first thin DLC layer can decrease the structural difference between the substrate and the external DLC film, thus the residual stress is decreased and the adhesion strength is improved. Consequently, because of the enhanced load bearing capacity and adhesion strength, the duplex DLC films is difficult to be fragile in the wear test, and the wear resistance is improved. Fig. 6 a shows the friction curves of duplex DLC films with variable carbon ion implantation time. It can be seen that the cut-through number of the duplex DLC films increases with the implantation time, and the sample with highest implantation time has the lowest friction coefficient. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6 b, the implantation voltage also shows an important influence on the wear resistance. The higher implantation voltage can get a larger cut-through number. The polarization curves of the substrate and the duplex treated sample using the optimum processing parameters are shown in Fig. 7 . The result shows that the duplex treated sample has a high corrosion potential, which indicates that the duplex PIIID treatment can increase the pitting corrosion resistance of the surface. 3.3 Batch processing of outer-rings of the bearing Using the optimum parameters obtained in this research and a cylinder-shape structure formed by 4 outer-rings of the bearing (type 6006), as shown in Fig. 8 , the PIIID batch treating process of outer-rings was carried out. In order to avoid the influence of the electric field near the outlet of this structure on the deposition uniformity, we added two outer-rings at both ends of the structure. In addition, to improve the uniformity along the circumference, we made the structure slowly roll around its axis. The as-treated outer-rings are also shown in Fig. 8 . No color difference can be found between different the outer-rings, which indicates that this inner surface PIIID method is a good candidate for batch treating of outer-rings. 4 Conclusions Using the PIIID process with low voltage PGD methods, DLC film can be synthesized inside a tube. Increase the pulse frequency and the bias voltage can improve the wear resistance. The duplex PIIID process combing the high and low voltage PGD techniques can obtain a high wear resistance layer because a thin DLC film formed by high voltage PGD process can improve the adhesion strength and the load bearing capacity. In addition, increase the implantation time and magnitude of the high voltage, wear resistance of the duplex DLC films can be improved. Using the optimum parameters obtained in this research and a cylinder-shape structure formed by 4 outer-rings of the bearing, batch processing of outer-rings can be realized.

        "abstract": "Titanium carbide films have been synthesized by plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID) on 9Cr18 bearing steel. During the experiments, acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) and titanium plasmas were generated simultaneously. Acetylene plasma was produced by a radio-frequency plasma source, and titanium plasma was generated by cathodic arc plasma source. Influences of gas pressure and pulse width of the bias voltage on properties of the thin film were investigated. The as-deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-hardness tester, pin-on-disc tribological facility and electrochemistry corrosion equipment. XRD pattern proves that TiC phase is formed in the film. Compared with uncoated substrates, micro-hardness results reveal that the maximum micro-hardness is increased by 70.8%. In addition, the friction coefficient decreases to about 0.1, and the corrosion resistance of coated substrate surfaces is improved significantly.",

        "abstract": "TiN/ZrO 2 multilayers with different modulation periods were synthesized on GCr15 bearing steel using plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIIID). The total thickness of the TiN/ZrO 2 multilayers was approximately 2\u00a0\u03bcm and the modulation period was varied from 8 to 400\u00a0nm. The as-deposited films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-hardness, friction, scratch and corrosion tests. The SEM result indicates that the structure of the TiN/ZrO 2 multilayers has a good periodicity. Micro-hardness testing results show that the hardness enhancement effect takes place at the specific period of 15\u00a0nm, 100\u00a0nm and 200\u00a0nm. In addition, the friction coefficient declined from 0.8 to 0.1\u20130.3 and the cut-through number was increased greatly. The critical load in the scratch test exceeds 100\u00a0N, which shows a high adhesion strength. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the TiN/ZrO 2 multilayers was improved significantly at the modulation period of 100\u00a0nm and 200\u00a0nm.",

Samples of 2Cr13 martensite stainless steel were placed inside the tube to investigate the performance of the films. Carbon ion implantation was finished by biasing the tube with a high voltage, and the DLC film deposition was obtained by biasing the tube with a medium voltage. Raman spectrum, ball-on-disc, indentation and scratch tests were used to investigate the structure, tribological property and adhesion strength of the as-deposited films. The Raman spectrum shows that the sp 3 bonding is formed in the as-synthesized film. Tribological and scratch test results reveal that the duplex DLC coating with the implantation time of 1\u00a0h has the largest adhesion strength and the best wear resistance.",

In this study, the electrical field was directly applied between source and drain areas of H shape patterns using the Mo\u2013W interconnecting layer. The effects of the current density and electrical field strength on the crystallization behavior were investigated. Results show that the crystallization behaviors at different bias areas are different. The difference is attributed to the coexisting effects of electromigration and potential gradient.

In the vicinity of the focus, far-field approximation conditions are used to simplify the derived integrals with sufficiently high accuracy. It is found that a noticeable deviation of the approximate integral, as characterized by a phenomenon of focal shift, from the exact integral can be observed when the maximum focusing semi-angle \u00e1 below \u03c0/9. For \u00e1=\u03c0/2, the radial spot size reduces to below 0.40\u00eb if cutting off the central segment, larger than \u03c0/4, of the paraboloid mirror. The sharp focusing property of the paraboloid mirror has the potential application in super-resolution confocal scanning microscopy.

For specular samples with steep slopes, the detector does not receive enough light and the detection algorithm is not be able to detect the peak position, and would generate non-measured points. Moreover, the mesoscopic penetration phenomenon has been ignored when measuring and observing the shapes of samples with multi-layer structures. But this phenomenon, due to the transparency of materials to certain wavelengths of light, may result in serious errors in the measurements of the heights of samples, as well as errors in the descriptions of their shapes. Here we describe the use of fluorophore-aided scattering microscopy to significantly extend the magnitudes of slopes that can be detected, and to essentially eliminate errors in measurements of height caused by mesoscopic penetration.",

However, mechanical inertia of the galvanometers introduces phase delay and ultimately leads to scanning distortions in \u03b1-\u03b2 circular scanning in both constant angular velocity scanning (CAVS) and constant line velocity scanning (CLVS). To compensate for the phase-delay distortions, two correction models are respectively proposed for CAVS and CLVS, which utilize phase-frequency relationships based on the galvanometer's transfer function. Experimental results show that the presented models can effectively correct rotation distortion in CAVS and tortuosity distortion in CLVS. The correction of phase-delay distortion can improve the image quality and refine positioning accuracy in laser scanning systems.",

In this study, a HADIE with a diameter of 80 mm is measured using a confocal profilometer with maximum horizontal and vertical measurement ranges of 120 mm and 12 mm, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the confocal profilometer can compensate for the fabrication error of the HADIE, which can be reduced from 7.20 \u00b5m to 1.05 \u00b5m. Furthermore, a profile error of 0.64 \u00b5m (measured peak-to-valley (P-V)) is obtained after correcting for the curvature error. The confocal profilometer is a nondestructive tool that can be used to measure the profile of HADIEs, and is particularly suitable in compensating for the fabrication error of fine optical elements.",

The method is based on illuminating the sample by a light source array, and then computationally integrating different images correspondent to each of the sources, in the Fourier domain. Knowledge of the exact relative position of the light sources and the sample is critical for the quality of the final recovered image. In this paper, we present an iterative approach towards correcting the position in the Fourier domain based on Newtonu0027s method. Also, an analysis is presented which shows the relation between the position error and the deterioration of the final recovery quality. The effectiveness of the presented method in improving the quality of the final recovered image is demonstrated using simulation and experimental results. Moreover, the method is shown to be more stable and robust to noises in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Representation of relative spatial relations between objects is often required in many multimedia database applications because spatial relations between objects in an image convey important information about the image. Quantitative representation of spatial relations taking into account shape, size, orientation and distance is often required. The R-Histogram is such a quantitative representation of spatial relations between two objects. However, this method only considers pixels on the object boundary, assuming that the objects are homeomorphic to a 2-ball. For objects with more complicated topology, we propose in this paper the R*-Histogram, a new extension to the R-Histogram. The R*-Histogram generalizes the R-Histogram by taking into account all the pixels in the objects. We also introduce an efficient O(kN log N) time algorithm to compute the R*-Histogram, which is asymptotically faster than the original O(N2) time algorithm for the R-Histogram even when k=O(n). Here, N=n2 denotes the number of pixels in the processed n x n image and k is the number of different directions considered. The effectiveness of the R*-Histogram is evaluated empirically with a Query By Example (QBE) system on a database of 2000 synthetic images containing objects with complicated shape and topology. Experiments have shown that the similarly search results match human intuition very well.",

We propose a SPHARM-based similarity comparison for shape sequences that allows fast similarity searches for dynamic objects and demonstrate it using 3D images of a beating heart. By using spherical harmonics to extract a small number of features that represent cardiac shape in each sequential state, we enable indexing and pruning of database entries with a multidimensional index tree (e.g. R*-tree) for fast retrieval. Our approach relies on obtaining selected landmarks to allow normalization within and between sequences. This framework is extensible to other application domains.",

        "abstract": "Numerous recent studies have shown that microarray gene expression data is useful for cancer classification. Classification based on microarray data is very different from previous classification problems in that the number of features (genes) greatly exceeds the number of instances (tissue samples). It has been shown that selecting a small set of informative genes can lead to improved classification accuracy. It is thus important to first apply feature selection methods prior to classification. In the machine learning field, one of the most successful feature filtering algorithms is the Relief-F algorithm. In this work, we empirically evaluate its performance on three published cancer classification data sets. We use the linear SVM and the k-NN as classifiers in the experiments, and compare the performance of Relief-F with other feature filtering methods, including Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and x^2-statistic. Using the leave-one-out cross validation, experimental results show that the performance of Relief-F is comparable with other methods.",

        "abstract": "Automatic generation of semantic metadata describing spatial relations is highly desirable for image digital libraries Relative spatial relations between objects in an image convey important information about the image. Because the perception of spatial relations is subjective, we propose a novel framework for automatic metadata generation based on fuzzy k-NN classification that generates fuzzy semantic metadata describing spatial relations between objects in an image. For each pair of objects of interest, the corresponding R-Histogram is computed and used as input for a set of fuzzy k--NN classifiers. The R-Histogram is a quantitative representation of spatial relations between two objects The outputs of the classifiers are soft class labels for each of the following eight spatial relations: 1) LEFT OF, 2) RIGHT OF, 3) ABOVE, 4) BELOW, 5) NEAR, 6) FAR, 7) INSIDE, 8) OUTSIDE Because the classifier-training stage involves annotating the training images manually, it is desirable to use as few training images as possible. To address this issue, we applied existing prototype selection techniques and also devised two new extensions. We evaluated the performance of different fuzzy k-NN algorithms and prototype selection algorithms empirically on both synthetic and real images. Preliminary experimental results show that our system is able to obtain good annotation accuracy (92%--98% on synthetic images and 82%--93% on real images) using only a small training set (4--5 images).",

        "abstract": "Quantitative measurements of changes in evolving brain pathology, such as multiple sclerosis lesions and brain tumors, are important for clinicians to perform pertinent diagnoses and to help in patient follow-up. Lesions or tumors can vary over time in size, shape, location and composition because of natural pathological processes or the effect of a drug treatment or therapy. In the past, people have used as a quantitative measurement the change in total or regional lesion/tumor volume. In this paper we propose a new model to quantify changes in evolving processes in multimodal 3D medical images. We believe this model reflects changes in pathology more accurately because it simultaneously takes into account information in multiple imaging modalities and the location of lesion/tumor voxels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model with experiments on synthetic lesion data.",

To improve the analysis of usage data, prior knowledge about usage patterns can be specified by the server admin- istrator as local exceptions to the standard dissimilarity measure, or lo- cal dissimilarity measures, which can be combined in non-linear ways. We outline a method to find similar trails under user-defined restric- tions within this heterogeneous feature space and an associated similar- ity space, and to describe progressions of trails representing a web access history. This information can then be used to reassign resources, e.g. by a web site administrator, to address deficiencies or shifting priorities in accessing web-based materials.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that microarray gene expression data are useful for phenotype classification of many diseases. A major problem in this classification is that the number of features (genes) greatly exceeds the number of instances (tissue samples). It has been shown that selecting a small set of informative genes can lead to improved classification accuracy. Many approaches have been proposed for this gene selection problem. Most of the previous gene ranking methods typically select 50-200 top-ranked genes and these genes are often highly correlated. Our goal is to select a small set of non-redundant marker genes that are most relevant for the classification task.To achieve this goal, we developed a novel hybrid approach that combines gene ranking and clustering analysis. In this approach, we first applied feature filtering algorithms to select a set of top-ranked genes, and then applied hierarchical clustering on these genes to generate a dendrogram. Finally, the dendrogram was analyzed by a sweep-line algorithm and marker genes are selected by collapsing dense clusters. Empirical study using three public datasets shows that our approach is capable of selecting relatively few marker genes while offering the same or better leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy compared with approaches that use top-ranked genes directly for classification.The HykGene software is freely available at http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wyh/software.htmwyh@cs.dartmouth.eduSupplementary material is available from http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wyh/hykgene/supplement/index.htm.",

We present a new problem formulation of specifying feature space with heterogeneous dissimilarity measures, and trying to find similar time series given these (expert) user-specified heterogeneities, both within the same feature and as combinations across multiple features. By allowing domain experts to describe their feature spaces more accurately in this fashion, query matches are better suited to the domain experts' needs. The presented work augments the existing research of finding local similarity areas and overall patterns in time series data.",

The evolution of the resistive switching polarity with sweeping voltage was observed. Our experiments showed that under a macroscopic electrode the homogeneous trapping-detrapping-type conduction and filament-type conduction coexist and compete with each other. For a large sweeping voltage range, the trapping-detrapping-type conduction dominates. However, for a small range the latter dominates. If the bias voltage is too large, the filament conduction could be destroyed. These results will help deepen the understanding of the resistive switching polarity, and will aid in future device design. \u00a9 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can be used as bendable dielectric due to its wide band gap. Here, we fabricate high quality h-BN films with controllable thickness by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition method. We demonstrate a parallel-plate capacitor using h-BN film as the dielectric. The h-BN capacitors are reliable with a high breakdown field strength of \u223c9.0 MV/cm. Tunneling current across the h-BN film is inversely exponential to the thickness of dielectric, which makes the capacitance drop significantly. The h-BN capacitor shows a best specific capacitance of 6.8 \u03bcF/cm2, which is one order of magnitude higher than the calculated value. \u00a9 2013 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional thin films with graphene domains embedding in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BNCx) has attractive application due to its tunable energy band gap. In this work, we report a one-step low pressure chemical vapor deposition method to fabricate large-area h-BNCx films without introducing carbon source. The carbon in h-BNCx derives from oil vapor of rotary pump, and it is well controlled by growing parameters, such as growing temperature, annealing time and growth time. It offers a method to fabricate h-BNCx film with low carbon concentration (<20 at.% C). Electron energy loss spectrum shows that boron, nitride and carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized and assemble into atomic layers. X-ray photoelectron spectra characterization further reveals that the h-BNCx has a hybridized structure with graphene domains embedding in h-BN layers. The intensity ratio of G-band and D-band in Raman spectra could be used to characterize the carbon content in h-BNCx film qualitatively. The band gap and electrical properties of the h-BNCx is tailored by the carbon concentration. The carrier mobility, resistivity perpendicular and parallel to the h-BNCx film are 5.1\ufffd\ufffd10-2 cm2.V-1.s-1, 55 k \ufffd\ufffd cm and 12.6 M\ufffd\ufffd cm for the samples with carbon concentration of 20.2 at.%, respectively. ? 2014 by American Scientific Publishers.",

We fabricated Ohmic contact on the n-type wide gap oxide Nb-doped SrTiO3 in nanoscale by mechanically scratching the surface using an atomic force microscopy tip. Although contacted to high work function metal, the scratched area exhibits nearly linear IV behavior with low contact resistance, which maintains for hours in vacuum. In contrast, the unscratched area shows Fowler\u2013Nordheim tunneling dominated Schottky rectifying behavior with high contact resistance. It was found that the Ohmic conductivity in the scratched area was drastically suppressed by oxygen gas indicating the oxygen vacancy origin of the Ohmic behavior. The surface oxygen vacancy induced barrier width reduction was proposed to explain the phenomena. The nanoscale approach is also applicable to macroscopic devices and has potential application in all-oxide devices.",

The same precursors, MnOOH nanowires, are transformed from hydrothermally grown MnO2 nanoflakes and directly attached on Ti foils via reaction with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). The Mn2O3 anode and LiMn2O4 cathode are subsequently formed by thermal annealing and reaction with lithium salt, respectively. The one-dimensional nanowire structures provide short lithium-ion diffusion path, good charge transport, and volume flexibility for Li+ intercalation/deintercalation, thus leading to good rate capability and cycling performance. As proof-of-concept, the Mn2O3 nanowire anode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 815.9 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and maintains a capacity of 502.3 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles. The LiMn2O4 nanowire cathodes show a reversible capacity of 94.7 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 and high capacity retention of \ufffd\ufffd96% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, a flexible Mn2O3//LiMn2O4 lithium ion full cell is fabricated, with an output voltage of >3 V, low thickness of 0.3 mm, high flexibility, and a specific capacity of 99 mA h g-1 based on the total weight of the cathode material. It also exhibits good cycling stability with a capacity of \ufffd\ufffd80 mA h g-1 after 40 charge/discharge cycles. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",

This redox-medium-assisted system enables a record-high solar-to-CO photoconversion efficiency of 15.6% under 1-sun intensity, and an outstanding electric energy efficiency of 63%.

This battery outputs a power density of 10\u2006217.74 W kg\u22121, which exceeds that of most supercapacitors, and an energy density of 48.93 W h kg\u22121, which equals that of thin-film lithium ion batteries. The safety issue generated by flammable organic electrolytes is fundamentally resolved by using an aqueous electrolyte. Compared with the conventional planar structure, the fiber shape also provides some unique and promising advantages, e.g., being three-dimensionally deformable. It can be also woven into a flexible power textile to satisfy a variety of new emerging fields, such as microelectronics and wearable electronics.",

Here, a Pt-decorated Ni3N nanosheet electrocatalyst is developed to achieve a top performance of hydrogen evolution in alkaline conditions. Possessing a high metallic conductivity and an atomic-thin semiconducting hydroxide surface, the Ni3N nanosheets serve as not only an efficient electron pathway without the hindrance of Schottky barriers, but also provide abundant active sites for water dissociation and generation of hydrogen intermediates, which are further adsorbed on the Pt surface to recombine to H2. The Pt-decorated Ni3N nanosheet catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution current density of 200 mA cm\u22122 at an overpotential of 160 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, a Tafel slope of \u224836.5 mV dec\u22121, and excellent stability of 82.5% current retention after 24 h of operation. Moreover, a hybrid cell consisting of a Pt-decorated Ni3N nanosheet cathode and a Li-metal anode is assembled to achieve simultaneous hydrogen evolution and electricity generation, exhibiting u003e60 h long-term hydrogen evolution reaction stability and an output voltage ranging from 1.3 to 2.2 V.",

Compared to conventional cobalt oxide prepared hydrothermally, this bridged-multi-octahedral NC structure exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performances towards oxygen evolution and reduction reactions, which is attributed to their preferential exposure of the Co-terminated {111} facets with a low Co coordination number, high electrochemically active surface area, and the reduced charge transfer resistance from the catalytic active sites to the underlying electrode, thus suggesting the tuning of crystal growth for the electrocatalytic enhancement.",

Enlightened by the photosynthesis of green plants, photo(electro)chemical catalysis of CO2 reduction, also known as artificial photosynthesis, is emerged as a promising candidate to address these demands and is widely investigated during the past decade. Among various artificial photosynthetic systems, solar-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction is widely recognized to possess high efficiencies and potentials for practical application. The efficient and selective electroreduction of CO2 is the key to the overall solar-to-chemical efficiency of artificial photosynthesis. Recent studies show that various metallic materials possess the capability to play as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. In order to achieve high selectivity for CO2 reduction products, various efforts are made including studies on electrolytes, crystal facets, oxide-derived catalysts, electronic and geometric structures, nanostructures, and mesoscale phenomena. In this Review, these methods for tuning the selectivity of CO2 electrochemical reduction of metallic catalysts are summarized. The challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed.",

The monodispersed, sub-10\u2005nm MnO nanoparticles offer high theoretical energy storage capacities and catalytic properties, and the mesoporous carbon coating allows for enhanced electrolyte transport and charge transfer towards/from MnO surface. In addition, the direct growth and attachment of the MnO@C nanocomposite in the supporting conductive substrates provide much reduced contact resistances and efficient charge transfer. These excellent features allow the use of MnO@C nanocomposites as lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor electrodes for energy storage, with high reversible capacity at large current densities, as well as excellent cycling and mechanical stabilities. Moreover, this MnO@C nanocomposite has also demonstrated a high sensitivity for H2O2 detection, and also exhibited attractive potential for the tumor cell analysis.",

        "abstract": "The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CORR) produces diverse chemical species. Cu clusters with a judiciously-controlled surface coordination number (CN) provide active sites that simultaneously optimize selectivity, activity, and efficiency for CORR. Here we report a strategy involving metal-organic framework (MOF)-regulated Cu cluster formation that shifts CO electroreduction toward multiple-carbon product generation. Specifically, we promoted undercoordinated sites during the formation of Cu clusters by controlling the structure of the Cu dimer, the precursor for Cu clusters. We distorted the symmetric paddle-wheel Cu dimer secondary building block of HKUST-1 to an asymmetric motif by separating adjacent benzene tricarboxylate moieties using thermal treatment. By varying materials processing conditions, we modulated the asymmetric local atomic structure, oxidation state and bonding strain of Cu dimers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, we observed the formation of Cu clusters with low CN from distorted Cu dimers in HKUST-1 during CO electroreduction. These exhibited 45% CH Faradaic efficiency (FE), a record for MOF-derived Cu cluster catalysts. A structure-activity relationship was established wherein the tuning of the Cu-Cu CN in Cu clusters determines the CORR selectivity.",

Prior studies show that the mixture of copper (I) and copper (0) at the catalyst surface enhances multi-carbon products from CO reduction; however, the stable presence of copper (I) remains the subject of debate. Here we report a copper on copper (I) composite that stabilizes copper (I) during CO reduction through the use of copper nitride as an underlying copper (I) species. We synthesize a\u00a0copper-on-nitride catalyst that exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 64\u2009\u00b1\u20092% for C products. We achieve a 40-fold enhancement in the ratio of C to the competing CH compared to the case of pure copper. We further show that the copper-on-nitride catalyst performs stable CO reduction over 30\u2009h. Mechanistic studies suggest that the use of copper nitride contributes to reducing the CO dimerization energy barrier-a rate-limiting step in CO reduction to multi-carbon products.",

Copper shows activity toward multi-carbon products from CO reduction, with reaction selectivity favoring two-carbon products; however, efficient conversion of CO to higher carbon products such as n-propanol, a liquid fuel, has yet to be achieved. We hypothesize that copper adparticles, possessing a high density of under-coordinated atoms, could serve as preferential sites for n-propanol formation. Density functional theory calculations suggest that copper adparticles increase CO binding energy and stabilize two-carbon intermediates, facilitating coupling between adsorbed *CO and two-carbon intermediates to form three-carbon products. We form adparticle-covered catalysts in-situ by mediating catalyst growth with strong CO chemisorption. The new catalysts exhibit an n-propanol Faradaic efficiency of 23% from CO reduction at an n-propanol partial current density of 11 mA\u00a0cm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised Restricted Boltzmann Machines (WRBM) approach to deal with the task of semantic segmentation with only image-level labels available. In WRBM, its hidden nodes are divided into multiple blocks, and each block corresponds to a specific label. Accordingly, semantic segmentation can be directly modeled by learning the mapping from visible layer to the hidden layer of WRBM. Specifically, based on the standard RBM, we import another two terms to make full use of image-level labels and alleviate the effect of noisy labels. First, we expect the hidden response of each superpixel is suppressed on the labels outside its parent image-level label set, and a non-image-level label suppression term is formulated to implicitly import the image-level labels as weak supervision. Second, semantic graph propagation is employed to exploit the cooccurrence between visually similar regions and labels. Besides, we deal with the problems of label imbalance and diverse backgrounds by adapting the block size to the label frequency and appending hidden response blocks corresponding to backgrounds respectively. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the good performance of our approach compared with some state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Successful semantic segmentation methods typically rely on the training datasets containing a large number of pixel-wise labeled images. To alleviate the dependence on such a fully annotated training dataset, in this paper, we propose a semi- and weakly-supervised learning framework by exploring images most only with image-level labels and very few with pixel-level labels, in which two stages of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training are included. First, a pixel-level supervised CNN is trained on very few fully annotated images. Second, given a large number of images with only image-level labels available, a collaborative-supervised CNN is designed to jointly perform the pixel-level and image-level classification tasks, while the pixel-level labels are predicted by the fully-supervised network in the first stage. The collaborative-supervised network can remain the discriminative ability of the fully-supervised model learned with fully labeled images, and further enhance the performance by importing more weakly labeled data. Our experiments on two challenging datasets, i.e, PASCAL VOC 2007 and LabelMe LMO, demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our approach, nearly matching the results achieved when all training images have pixel-level labels.",

This paper proposed a deep framework for commodity image retrieval(CMIR) from the view that they are same designed commodities. Our framework can catch as many design details as possible by exploring object detection and ranking sensitive feature learning, while the former is performed based on Faster R-CNN, and the later is learned with a multi-task Siamese Network. Besides, we refine the processing speed of the framework to make it a live system.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in semantic segmentation are driven by the success of fully convolutional neural network (FCN). However, the coarse label map from the network and the object discrimination ability for semantic segmentation weaken the performance of those FCN-based models. To address these issues, we propose an objectness-aware semantic segmentation framework (OA-Seg) by jointly learning an object proposal network (OPN) and a lightweight deconvolutional neural network (Light-DCNN). First, OPN is learned based on a fully convolutional architecture to simultaneously predict object bounding boxes and their objectness scores. Second, we design a Light-DCNN to provide a finer upsampling way than FCN. The Light-DCNN is constructed with convolutional layers in VGG-net and their mirrored deconvolutional structure, where all fully-connected layers are removed. And hierarchical classification layers are added to multi-scale deconvolutional features to introduce more contextual information for pixel-wise label prediction. Compared with previous works, our approach performs an obvious decrease on model size and convergence time. Thorough evaluations are performed on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark, and our model yields impressive results on its validation data (70.3% mean IoU) and test data (74.1% mean IoU).",

Along the temporal dimension, we introduce Transition Layers upon the structure of HDCNN to make the pixel-wise label prediction consist with adjacent pixels across space and time domains. The learning process of the Transition Layers can be implemented as a set of extra convolutional calculations connected with HDCNN.

To imitate human search process, we attempt to match candidate images with theimaginary image in user single s mind instead of the sketch query, i.e., not only the shape information of sketches but their possible content information are considered in SBIR. Specifically, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is employed to enrich the content information of sketches and recover the imaginary images, and two VGG-based encoders, which work on real and imaginary images respectively, are used to constrain their perceptual consistency from the view of feature representations. During SBIR, we first generate an imaginary image from a given sketch via cGAN, and then take the output of the learned encoder for imaginary images as the feature of the query sketch.

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation and single-view depth estimation are two fundamental problems in computer vision. They exploit the semantic and geometric properties of images, respectively, and are thus complementary in scene understanding. In this paper, we propose a collaborative deconvolutional neural network (C-DCNN) to jointly model these two problems for mutual promotion. The C-DCNN consists of two DCNNs, of which each is for one task. The DCNNs provide a finer resolution reconstruction method and are pretrained with hierarchical supervision. The feature maps from these two DCNNs are integrated via a pointwise bilinear layer, which fuses the semantic and depth information and produces higher order features. Then, the integrated features are fed into two sibling classification layers to simultaneously learn for semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this way, we combine the semantic and depth features in a unified deep network and jointly train them to benefit each other. Specifically, during network training, we process depth estimation as a classification problem where a soft mapping strategy is proposed to map the continuous depth values into discrete probability distributions and the cross entropy loss is used. Besides, a fully connected conditional random field is also used as postprocessing to further improve the performance of semantic segmentation, where the proximity relations of pixels on position, intensity, and depth are jointly considered. We evaluate our approach on two challenging benchmarks: NYU Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D. It is demonstrated that our approach effectively utilizes these two kinds of information and achieves state-of-the-art results on both the semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks.",

High-resolution SAR images should be useful in revealing eddy features and investigating the eddy imaging mechanism. However, SAR imaging is affected by various radar parameters and environmental factors, which makes it quite difficult to learn directly from SAR eddy images. In order to interpret and evaluate eddy images, developing a proper simulation method is necessary. However, seldom has a SAR simulation method for oceanic eddies, especially for shear-wave-generated eddies, been established. As a step forward, we propose a simulation method for oceanic shear-wave-generated eddies. The Burgers-Rott vortex model is used to specify the surface current field of the simulated eddies. Images are then simulated for a range of different radar frequencies, radar look directions, wind speeds, and wind directions. The results show that the simulated images are consistent with actual SAR images. The effects of different radar parameters and wind fields on SAR eddy imaging are analyzed by qualitative and quantitative methods. Overall, the simulated images produce a surface pattern and brightness variations with characteristics resembling actual SAR images of oceanic eddies.",

        "abstract": "We are witnessing an explosive development and widespread application of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields. However, DNN models, especially a convolutional neural network (CNN), usually involve massive parameters and are computationally expensive, making them extremely dependent on high-performance hardware. This prohibits their further extensions, \\eg applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a quantized CNN, a unified approach to accelerate and compress convolutional networks. Guided by minimizing the approximation error of individual layer's response, both fully connected and convolutional layers are carefully quantized. The inference computation can be effectively carried out on the quantized network, with much lower memory and storage consumption. Quantitative evaluation on two publicly available benchmarks demonstrates the promising performance of our approach: with comparable classification accuracy, it achieves 4 to 6$x$ acceleration and 15 to 20$x$ compression. With our method, accurate image classification can even be directly carried out on mobile devices within 1 s.",

        "abstract": "Remarkable advances have been made toward the structural characterization of ion channels in the last two decades. However, the unambiguous assignment of well-defined functional states to the obtained structural models has proved challenging. In the case of the superfamily of nicotinic-receptor channels (also referred to as pentameric ligand-gated ion channels [pLGICs]), for example, two different types of model of the open-channel conformation have been proposed on the basis of structures solved to resolutions better than 4.0 \u00c5. At the level of the transmembrane pore, the open-state models of the proton-gated pLGIC from  (GLIC) and the invertebrate glutamate-gated Cl channel (GluCl) are very similar to each other, but that of the glycine receptor (GlyR) is considerably wider. Indeed, the mean distances between the axis of ion permeation and the C\u03b1 atoms at the narrowest constriction of the pore (position -2') differ by \u223c2 \u00c5 in these two classes of model, a large difference when it comes to understanding the physicochemical bases of ion conduction and charge selectivity. Here, we take advantage of the extreme open-channel stabilizing effect of mutations at pore-facing position 9'. We find that the I9'A mutation slows down entry into desensitization of GLIC to the extent that macroscopic currents decay only slightly by the end of pH 4.5 solution applications to the extracellular side for several minutes. We crystallize (at pH 4.5) two variants of GLIC carrying this mutation and solve their structures to resolutions of 3.12 \u00c5 and 3.36 \u00c5. Furthermore, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation and picrotoxinin block, using the different open-channel structural models. On the basis of these results, we favor the notion that the open-channel structure of pLGICs from animals is much closer to that of the narrow models (of GLIC and GluCl) than it is to that of the GlyR.",

Within the postsynaptic density, however, AMPA receptors coassemble with transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), yielding a receptor complex with altered gating kinetics, pharmacology, and pore properties. Here, we elucidate structures of the GluA2-TARP \u03b32 complex in the presence of the partial agonist kainate or the full agonist quisqualate together with a positive allosteric modulator or with quisqualate alone. We show how TARPs sculpt the ligand-binding domain gating ring, enhancing kainate potency and diminishing the ensemble of desensitized states. TARPs encircle the receptor ion channel, stabilizing M2 helices and pore loops, illustrating how TARPs alter receptor pore properties. Structural and computational analysis suggests the full agonist and modulator complex harbors an ion-permeable channel gate, providing the first view of an activated AMPA receptor.",

        "abstract": "Alternative complex III (ACIII) is a key component of the respiratory and/or photosynthetic electron transport chains of many bacteria. Like complex III (also known as the bc complex), ACIII catalyses the oxidation of membrane-bound quinol and the reduction of cytochrome c or an equivalent electron carrier. However, the two complexes have no structural similarity. Although ACIII has eluded structural characterization, several of its subunits are known to be homologous to members of the complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme\u00a0(CISM) superfamily  , including the proton pump polysulfide reductase. We isolated the ACIII from Flavobacterium johnsoniae with native lipids using styrene maleic acid copolymer, both as an independent enzyme and as a functional 1:1 supercomplex with an aa-type cytochrome c oxidase (cyt aa). We determined the structure of ACIII to 3.4 \u00c5 resolution by cryo-electron microscopy and constructed an atomic model for its six subunits. The structure, which contains a [3Fe-4S] cluster, a [4Fe-4S] cluster and six haem c units, shows that ACIII uses known elements from other electron transport complexes arranged in a previously unknown manner. Modelling of the cyt aa component of the supercomplex revealed that it is structurally modified to facilitate association with ACIII, illustrating the importance of the supercomplex in this electron transport chain. The structure also resolves two of the subunits of ACIII that are anchored to the lipid bilayer with N-terminal triacylated cysteine residues, an important post-translational modification found in numerous prokaryotic membrane proteins that has not previously been observed structurally in a lipid bilayer.",

        "abstract": "Accurate structure determination from electron density maps at 3-5 \u00c5 resolution necessitates a balance between extensive global and local sampling of atomistic models, yet with stereochemical correctness of backbone and sidechain geometries. Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF), particularly through a resolution-exchange scheme, ReMDFF, provides a robust way of achieving this balance for hybrid structure determination. Employing two high-resolution density maps, namely that of \u03b2-galactosidase at 3.2 \u00c5 and TRPV1 at 3.4 \u00c5, we showcase the quality of ReMDFF-generated models, comparing them against ones submitted by independent research groups for the 2015-2016 Cryo-EM Model Challenge. This comparison offers a clear evaluation of ReMDFF's strengths and shortcomings, and those of data-guided real-space refinements in general. ReMDFF results scored highly on the various metric for judging the quality-of-fit and quality-of-model. However, some systematic discrepancies are also noted employing a Molprobity analysis, that are reproducible across multiple competition entries. A space of key refinement parameters is explored within ReMDFF to observe their impact within the final model. Choice of force field parameters and initial model seem to have the most significant impact on ReMDFF model-quality. To this end, very recently developed CHARMM36m force field parameters provide now more refined ReMDFF models than the ones originally submitted to the Cryo-EM challenge. Finally, a set of good-practices is prescribed for the community to benefit from the MDFF developments.",

        "abstract": "One of the structurally well characterized allosterically regulated systems is the BetP membrane transporter protein. It is a trimeric protein that transports osmolytes but only when the cytoplasmic osmotic pressure exceeds a threshold. The regulatory domain mainly consists of three helical C-terminal regions of the trimeric complex. Based on the partially resolved crystal structures, each C-terminal region has contacts with one of its neighbors. It has been proposed that this cross-contact activates the substrate transport. However, how these C-terminal domains interact is still unknown since two C-terminal regions are missing from every available BetP structure. Furthermore, how the regulatory domain affects the functional domain is still a mystery. Here we present several major findings based on an a recently developed computational technique named xMDFF which resolves the structural information with the guidance of experimental X-ray diffraction data. In addition, we performed an extensive set of molecular dynamics simulations and allosteric network analyses to characterize the propagation of allosteric effects. The missing C-terminal regions have been reconstructed for three crystal structures of BetP with equivalent or better R-free/R-work and cross-correlation scores than the previously reported ones. The new structures revealed that the orientation of the C-terminal domains is symmetric in one case while being asymmetric in the others, indicating that the regulatory domain at active state is not a single state as has been previously believed. Simulation results showed that there are multiple ways for the C-terminal regions to interact with each other and the transition between symmetric and asymmetric arrangement was also observed. In addition, the network analyses showed multiple paths connecting the regulatory domain and the EH2 helix, a potential secondary substrate binding site. Together, these results lay out a new general mechanism for the allosteric regulations for multicomponent membrane transporters like BetP.",

        "abstract": "Biological membranes and their diverse lipid constituents play key roles in a broad spectrum of cellular and physiological processes. Characterization of membrane-associated phenomena at a microscopic level is therefore essential to our fundamental understanding of such processes. Due to the semi-fluid and dynamic nature of lipid bilayers, and their complex compositions, detailed characterization of biological membranes at an atomic scale has been refractory to experimental approaches. Computational modeling and simulation offer a highly complementary toolset with sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions to fill this gap. Here, we review recent molecular dynamics studies focusing on the diversity of lipid composition of biological membranes, or aiming at the characterization of lipid\u2013protein interaction, with the overall goal of dissecting how lipids impact biological roles of the cellular membranes.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, and FGFR4 polymorphisms have been implicated in both normal development and cancer, including breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated correlations between polymorphisms in FGFR4 and breast cancer prognosis. The FGFR4 SNPs rs1966265 and rs351855 were genotyped in 747 breast cancer patients using the SNaPshot method. FGFR4 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 339 samples. SNP rs351855 was correlated with FGFR4 protein expression under dominant and co-dominant models. Lymph node metastasis (LNM), ER (estrogen receptor) status and molecular subtype were associated with high FGFR4 expression. Univariate analysis revealed rs351855 (CC/CT: P\u2009=\u20090.027, CC/TT: P\u2009<\u20090.001, CC/CT\u2009+\u2009TT: P\u2009=\u20090.005) to be a prognostic predictor, and multivariate analysis indicated rs351855 (CC/TT: P\u2009=\u20090.005) to be an independent prognostic factor. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high FGFR4 protein expression was associated with a poor prognosis. SNP rs351855 was correlated with worse outcomes, with a dose-dependent effect. The results of this study show that FGFR4 SNP rs351855 is associated with up-regulation of FGFR4 protein expression and a worse prognosis in breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

In real-time scenario, two phrases are actually involved in the kNN POI query process: the positioning process and the searching process, in the former process, the user obtains his location and then send it to the POI provider to retrieve the result in the later process. Location privacy concerns are exist in both two processes and have been studied separately in the past researches. We argue that this division is lack of globality. In this paper, we propose a real-time one phrase location privacy-aware method for the POI searching. By performing the projection method on the POI data and the positioning infrastructure, we design a one phrase POI searching scheme which can cloak the location information. The evaluation result shows the practicability of our method.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of network, big data has become an important research field for many areas such as data mining, machine learning, information diffusion, the internet of things, and social networks. The multimedia information spreads faster since the rise of social network where people can create and share images, video and audio contents. More and more people share and comment on the web through the mobile terminal to express their mends. Online content captures online behavior of users who communicate or interact on a diversity of issues and topics. How to predict the popularity of the online content happened recently is a hot topic and lots of people are trying to find out the law of information diffusion hidden in it. However, many models assume that information spreads with no external interference in social networks. The research on competitive diffusion is still at the primary stage. The main contribution of this paper is to solve the problem that there are few or no work for popularity prediction based on multi-information, and propose a model based on competitive matrix with a cluster-based news classification approach. The goal of this paper is to accurately estimate the popularity of a given viral topic at final based on the observation of its historical characteristics. And this model is mainly based on the competitive matrix and gradient descent method. Also, the capability of this method provides a better performance in the popularity prediction according to an empirical study.",

        "abstract": "The burgeoning technology of Mobile Edge Computing is attracting the traditional LBS and LS to deploy due to its nature characters such as low latency and location awareness. Although this transplant will avoid the location privacy threat from the central cloud provider, there still exists the privacy concerns in the LS of MEC scenario. Location privacy threat arises during the procedure of the fingerprint localization, and the previous studies on location privacy are ineffective because of the different threat model and information semantic. To address the location privacy in MEC environment, we designed LoPEC, a novel and effective scheme for protecting location privacy for the MEC devices. By the proper model of the RAN access points, we proposed the noise-addition method for the fingerprint data, and successfully induce the attacker from recognizing the real location. Our evaluation proves that LoPEC effectively prevents the attacker from obtaining the useru0027s location precisely in both single-point and trajectory scenarios.",

An attacker can even infer usersu0027 interests and hobbies based on the location information exposed by them. Although many location privacy protection approaches have been proposed, most of them focus on the stage of providing location to LBS server. In the paper, we propose an Optimal Fingerprints Construction(OFC) algorithm to achieve k-anonymity for users. Different from existing studies, the OFC algorithm focuses on the stage of getting location from Location Provider(LP) and generates dummy user fingerprints to resist adversaries. We first analyze the privacy threats in the positioning process. Considering LP might be potential adversary, we then design the anonymous knowledge base and the location privacy protection algorithm. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed solution on the smart phone. Simulation results show that our proposed solution is promising.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, location privacy concerns that arise when using the nearest neighbor query services have gained increasing attention, as such services have become pervasive in mobile social networks devices and the IoT environments. State-of-the-art privacy preservation schemes focus on the obfuscation of the location information, which has suffered from various privacy attacks and the tradeoff of the quality of service. By noticing the fact that the user's location could be replaced by their surrounding wireless sensor infrastructures in proximity, in this paper, we propose a wireless sensor access point-based scheme for the nearest neighbor query, without using the location of the user. Then, a noise-addition-based method that preserves user's location privacy was proposed. To further strengthen the adaptability of the approach to real-world environments, several performance-enhancing methods are introduced, including an R-tree-based Noise-Data Retrieval Algorithm (RNR), and a nearest neighbor query method based on our research. Both performance and security evaluations are conducted to validate our approach. The results show the effectiveness and the practicality of our work.",

        "abstract": "Mobile service computing relies on efficient and secure data transfer. Geometric routing, which guarantees scalability, efficiency, and mobility, is a promising routing scheme for mobile services in the resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT). However, the private data transmitted by geometric routing may be eavesdropped by the malicious node and the privacy-preserving becomes one of the important issues for the mobile service in IoTs. Due to the resource constrains, approaches using encryption or hashing are not suitable for geometric routing. In this paper, we propose a lightweight anonymous geometric routing (LAGER) to protect the node-related private data. Instead of using the encryption or hashing approach, LAGER adopts a coordinate confusion mechanism which provides each node an anonymous coordinate of virtual node, such that the private data is decoupled from the node coordinate. The malicious node cannot determine which node the data belongs to even if it obtains the private data. To support the data transmission with anonymous coordinates, LAGER adopts a hybrid routing scheme by combining the greedy routing and a source routing. The experiment results show that LAGER provides effective anonymity with acceptable costs of scalability and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new type of extended state observer (ESO) for state observation of nonlinear system with measurement noise. ESO can observe the inner and outer disturbance of uncertain system and it is the foundation of active disturbance-rejection controller, while the measurement noise degrades the performance of the normal ESO. In this paper, fal function feedback structure is used to deal with measurement noise, then ESO is applied, thus their combination can eliminate the effect of measure noise on ESO. Comparing with the method of extending a rank state to ESO and the method of extending the filter equation to ESO, this new method does not need to extend the rank of ESO. So the tracking error increasing problem and the parameter tuning problem which are brought by the rank increase of ESO can be avoided. The simulation results shows that this method can satisfactorily track states for system with measurement noise.",

At first, the characteristics and the main control problem for blended system are analyzed and the blended control model is established. Then, three close loops design method is proposed for the blended control system. The inner-loop and medium-loop are designed by auto disturbance-rejection controller, which is insensitive to the variation of the plant parameters and external disturbance. The external-loop is designed by PI controller. The simulation results show that the designed system attains high dynamic performance and steady-state performance and the controller has excellent robustness performance.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is arguably more limiting than nitrogen for forest ecosystems being free of disturbances for lengthy time periods. The elucidation of multivariate relationships between foliar P and its primary drivers for dominant species is an urgent issue and formidable challenge for ecologists. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of primary drivers on foliar P of Quercus wutaishanica, the dominant species in broadleaved deciduous forest at the Loess Plateau, China. We sampled the leaves of 90 Q. wutaishanica individuals across broad climate and soil nutrient gradients at the Loess Plateau, China, and employed structural equation models (SEM) to evaluate multiple causal pathways and the relative importance of the drivers for foliar P per unit mass (Pmass) and per unit area (Parea). Our SEMs explained 73% and 81% of the variations in Pmass and Parea, respectively. Pmass was negatively correlated to leaf mass per area, positively correlated to leaf area, and increased with mean annual precipitation and total soil potassium. Parea was positively correlated to leaf mass per area, leaf dry weight, and increased significantly with total soil potassium. Our results demonstrated that leaf P content of Q. wutaishanica increased with total soil potassium in the Loess Plateau accordingly.",

        "abstract": "The typically sparse or lacking distribution of meteorological stations in mountainous areas inadequately resolves temperature elevation variability. This study presented the diurnal and seasonal variations of the elevation gradient of air temperature in the northern flank of the western Qinling Mountain range, which has not been thoroughly evaluated. The measurements were conducted at 9 different elevations between 1710 and 2500 m from August 2014 to August 2015 with HOBO Data loggers. The results showed that the annual temperature lapse rates (TLRs) for Tmean, Tmin and Tmax were 0.45\u00b0C/100m, 0.44\u00b0C/100m and 0.40\u00b0C/100m, respectively, which are substantially smaller than the often used value of 0.60\u00b0C/100m to 0.60\u00b0C/100m. The TLRs showed no obvious seasonal variations, except for the maximum temperature lapse rate, which was steeper in winter and shallower in spring. Additionally, the TLRs showed significant diurnal variations, with the steepest TLR in forenoon and the shallowest in early morning or late-afternoon, and the TLRs changed more severely during the daytime than night time. The accumulated temperature above 0\u00b0C, 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C (AT0, AT5 and AT10) decreased at a lapse rate of 112.8\u00b0C days/100 m, 104.5\u00b0C days/100 m and 137.0\u00b0C days/100 m, respectively. The monthly and annual mean diurnal range of temperatures (MDRT and ADRT) demonstrated unimodal curves along the elevation gradients, while the annual range of temperature (ART) showed no significant elevation differences. Our results strongly suggest that the extrapolated regional TLR may not be a good representative for an individual mountainside, in particular, where there are only sparse meteorological stations at high elevations.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing spatiotemporal variation of tree cover could enhance understanding of the environment and promote a sustainable resource use of ecosystems. This study investigated the variation in tree cover in the Loess Plateau after an ecological restoration effort called the \u2018Grain for Green Project\u2019 (GGP). The results show that the proportion of tree covered area in the Loess Plateau changed from 73% to 88%, with the cumulative tree cover fluctuating from approximately 7% to 11%, and the average annual tree cover increased from 10% in 2000 to 12% in 2014. Based on tree cover values over the course of 15 years, the study area was classified into five regions, which provide much more information for spatial assessment of tree cover change in the Loess Plateau spatially. The increase in tree cover value was mainly in the core part of Loess Plateau, the mountains, and the edge of the mountain areas; whereas the values were stable in 36.21% of the area, and a decrease was noted in 5.63% of the area, primarily located in the low plain areas. Approximately 26.36% of the Loess Plateau will show a sustained increase in tree cover in the future. The results of this study will facilitate us to understand the current conditions and development of the GGP\u2019s effects, and offer a valuable reference for future detection of tree cover change through geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) tools.",

Unlike existing blind receivers that are based on the scheme that channels are estimated first and then equalizers (MMSE or ZF) are adopted to detect information symbols, our scheme is based on the symbol-block-by-symbol-block direct symbol estimation approach. The proposed receiver is also robust in rapid channel variation cases as long as channel responses remain almost constant during one symbol block. Simulation results show that the BER performance of our scheme and linear MMSE (and ZF) equalizers with perfect CSI are indistinguishable in SNR scenarios of interests, despite the fact that our scheme is totally blind.",

        "abstract": "Resistance mutations to antibiotics targeting rRNA can be far from the drug-binding site. Crystallography studies revealed that the antibiotic resistance mutation G2482A (G2447A in E. coli ) in Haloarcula marismortui 50S ribosomes does not directly contact the drug or introduce changes to the ribosomal structure except for losing a potassium ion coordinated to a base triple at the drug-binding site. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we tested hypotheses regarding the effects of the G2482A mutation and ion coordination on the conformational dynamics of the 50S ribosome. Simulations show that the mutation enhances conformational fluctuation at the antibiotic binding site, weakens the hydrogen-bonding network, and increases flexibility at the 50S peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Our data supports the view that distant mutations can perturb the dynamic network in the ribosomal PTC, thereby raising the entropic cost of antibiotic binding. These results underscore the importance of considering conformational dynamics in rational drug design. ",

Through this manner, electricity is transformed into chemical energy. CO 2  and H 2 O is directly simultaneous electrolysis under constant 0.25\u00a0A with 30\u00a0cm 2  nickel anode and 30\u00a0cm 2  iron cathode in a 600\u00a0\u00b0C alkali carbonate with LiOH electrolyte in mole ratio of n H :n C \u00a0=\u00a00.15:1, achieving the storage of electricity to chemical energy. This electrolysis provides a gaseous product comprising 45.9% methane, 53.1% H 2 , 0.92% CO and trace amounts of longer (than methane) hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the current efficiency is still \u223c51% for 60\u00a0min.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel green method was presented for the simultaneous synthesis of syngas, a mixture of CO and H 2 , via the co-electrolysis of CO 2 /H 2 O using an established eutectic-salt electrolyte. Optimum electrolysis was carried out at 2.2\u00a0V using a two-electrode system composed of a coiled Fe cathode and a coiled Ni anode in eutectic Li 1.07 Na 0.75 Ca 0.045 CO 3 /0.15LiOH. The molar ratio of H 2 /CO was finely tuned from 1.96 to 7.97 by controlling the amount of CaCO 3 . The optimized current efficiency, \u223c92%, was acquired by 14.28\u00a0wt% CaCO 3  addition. Moreover, the relatively low operating temperature of 600\u00a0\u00b0C was beneficial for practical applications compared to previously reported temperatures in excess of 800\u00a0\u00b0C, providing a feasible basis for syngas production via electrochemical synthesis. In this manner, CO 2 /H 2 O was synergistically converted into valuable chemicals, allowing the CO 2  to be utilized efficiently for the conversion and storage of electricity to chemical energy.",

Herein, CO 2  is captured and transformed electrochemically with H 2 O to controllably generate CH 4  and H 2  in an electrolyte comprising a eutectic of carbonates and hydroxides with equal-area Fe cathode and Ni anode. Gas chromatography (GC) is employed to analyze the content of gaseous products.

        "abstract": "MgFe2O4 implanted with ZnO and silver nanoparticles has been successfully synthesized. The formation mechanism of the core~shell structured Ag/ZnO/MgFe2O4 nanoparticles was investigated. The efficacy of degradation of an organic dye was compared under the visible light irradiation with the individual components (MgFe2O4, ZnO, and Ag). The structure of Ag/ZnO/MgFe2O4 nanoparticles was established from detailed structural analyses using a vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ag/ZnO/MgFe2O4 nanoparticles showed a saturation magnetization (Ms) of 44\u2009emu/g. It is seen from the results that ZnO is coated on the surface of MgFe2O4 nanoparticles, and Ag nanoparticles are attached to the edge of the ZnO/MgFe2O4 nanoparticles. In addition, the nanoparticles were found to be spherical with appropriate structures. The electron transfer mechanism greatly enhances the rhodamine B (RhB) degradation rate, which is illustrated and discussed in detail. The obtained Ag/ZnO/MgFe2O4 nanoparticles were photostable and magnetically recyclable with potential application in the degradation of organic pollutants.",

        "abstract": "Spinel ferrite structured ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal method combined with a solvothermal approach. For the synthesis of the ZnFe2O4/rGO nanocomposites, the rGO nanosheet contains epoxy functional groups serving as the active sites, which allowed the formation of uniform ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles. Due to the structure of the ZnFe2O4/RGO nanocomposites, the aggregation of the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles can be readily disrupted and electronic transfer through the rGO nanosheets is accelerated. This could in turn enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. It was also demonstrated that ZnFe2O4/rGO (40 wt-%) hybrid nanocomposites almost reached adsorption equilibrium in the RhB dye within 60\u2009min. The Langmuir equation model showed that the photodegradation of RhB was well fitted to first order reaction kinetics with k\u2009=\u20090.6254\u2009min\u22121. This illustrated that the addition of GO could reduce the bandgap of pure ZnFe2O4, which avoided the combination of electrons and holes. The ZnFe2O4/rGO nanocomposites could also enhance the utilisation of sunlight. In addition, the ZnFe2O4/rGO nanocomposite photocatalyst also demonstrated a supramagnetic property, holding potential to be utilised for water treatment.",

Motivated by such limitation, a three-dimensional vibro-acoustic coupling model for sound attenuation analysis of elastically restrained plate silencer backed by irregular acoustical cavity is established in a unified energy formulation. Coordinate transformation technique is employed to map the acoustical field description associated with the irregular-shaped cavity into those defined in a unit cubic volume. Boundary smoothed supplementary terms are introduced to the Fourier series to construct the corresponding admissible function, in conjunction with Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, the fully coupled matrix is derived, in which the concrete block can be specified for the irregular cavity subsystem. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model through the comparison with those calculated from Finite Element Analysis. Based on the model established, the influence of geometry distortion of backed cavity on sound attenuation behavior of such drum silencer is studied and addressed. It is found that the wall inclination arrangement can modify the duct-panel-cavity structural-acoustic coupling pattern, and further serve as the optimal parameter to adjust the transmission loss frequency band. Experimental study is also carried out to verify the theoretical prediction from current model.",

Two coupled in-plane displacement fields are constructed as Fourier series with smoothed supplementary polynomials to remove the relevant differential discontinuities associated with the original radial component at inner and/or outer edges. Any type of boundary conditions can be easily achieved by setting the boundary restraining stiffness accordingly. System characteristic matrix is obtained through the comparison of all expanded Fourier series coefficients. Numerical examples are then presented to validate the correctness and reliability of the proposed solution by comparing them with those solved from other approaches. Based on the model established, significant influence of elastic boundary condition on the in-plane modal characteristics of rotating annular panel is investigated and addressed. This work represents the first time that analytical solution for the in-plane vibration of rotating circular panel with general boundary conditions is derived, and can also shed some new light on the understanding of complex dynamic behavior of such structural system.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variation and clonal diversity of three natural populations of the rare, highly clonal marsh herb Caldesia grandis Samuelsson were investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Both of the markers worked effectively in clone identification of C . grandis . RAPD markers detected more diversity than ISSR markers in the three populations examined. Of the 60 RAPD primers screened, seven produced highly reproducible bands. Using these primers, a total of 61 DNA fragments were generated with 52 (85.25%) being polymorphic indicating considerable genetic variation at the species level. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that a large proportion of genetic variation (81.5%) resided within populations, while only a small proportion (18.5%) resided among populations. With the use of 52 polymorphic RAPD markers, we were able to identify 127 genets among 342 samples from three populations. The proportion of distinguishable genets (PD: mean 0.37), Simpson's diversity index ( D : mean 0.91), and evenness ( E : mean 0.78) exhibited high levels of clonal diversity compared to other clonal plants. These results imply that sexual reproduction has played an important role at some time during the history of these populations. Nevertheless, the high level of diversity could have been also partially generated from somatic mutations, although this is unlikely to account for the high diversity generally found among C . grandis genets.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, all-atom and coarse-grained models have been developed and applied to simulations of micelles and biological membranes. Here, we explore the question of whether a combined all-atom representation of surfactant molecules and continuum description of solvent based on the generalized Born model can be used to study surfactant micelles. Specifically, we report the parameterization of the GBSW model with a surface-area dependent nonpolar solvation energy term for dodecyl sulfate, dodecyl tetramethylammonium, and dodecyl triethyleneglycol ether molecules. In the parameterization procedure,the atomic Born radii were derived from the radial distribution functions of solvent charge and refined targeting the potential of mean force of dimer interactions from explicit-solvent simulations. The optimized radii were then applied in molecular dynamics simulations of the ionic and nonionic micelles.We found that the micelles are stable but more compact and rigid than in explicit solvent as a consequence of the drastic reduction in solvation and mobility of surfactant monomers within the micelle. Based on these data and our previous work, we suggest that in addition to a more accurate description of the nonpolar solvation energy, the ruggedness in the short-range interactions due to solvent granularity is a critical feature that needs to be taken into account to accurately model processes such as micelle formation and protein folding in implicit solvent. Finally, the explicit-solvent data presented here offers new insights into different conformational behavior of ionic and nonionic micelles which is valuable for understanding hydrophobic assemblies and of interest to the detergent industry.",

The virulence of TE3L(-)VTT was compared with that of the wild-type VTT both in vivo and in vitro. The humoral and cellular immune responses were detected in a mouse model to test the vaccine efficacy of the TE3L mutant. The results suggested that deletion of the TE3L gene decreased the virulence and neurovirulence significantly in mice and rabbit models, yet retained the immunogenicity.

Viruses expressing EGFP were then screened for and purified by serial plaque formation. In a second step the marker EGFP gene was removed by transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding cre recombinase and selecting for viruses that had lost the EGFP phenotype. The MVTT3 mutant was shown to be avirulent and immunogenic.

        "abstract": "Interferons (IFNs) establish dynamic host defense mechanisms by inducing various IFN-stimulated genes that encodes many antiviral innate immune effectors. IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins have been identified as intrinsic antiviral effectors, which block the entry of a broad spectrum of enveloped RNA viruses by interrupting virus-endosomal fusion. However, antiviral activity of IFITM proteins against mammalian DNA virus has not been demonstrated till date. Here, we sought to investigate the antiviral activities and mechanisms of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) protein against poxvirus infection. Analysis of expression kinetics of cell endogenous IFITM3 protein indicated that vaccinia virus (VACV) infection suppressed its translation, which was independent of IRF3 phosphorylation triggered by VACV. Although silencing of endogenous IFITM proteins did not affect their baseline antiviral effects in the cell, it has reduced the IFN-\u03b1-mediated inhibition of VACV infection, and also modulated VACV-induced cell death. Moreover, we discovered that overexpression of IFITM3 significantly restricted VACV infection, replication and proliferation mainly by interfering with virus entry processes prior to the virus nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm. Interestingly, IFITM3 overexpression showed an impact on virus binding. Furthermore, IFITM3 interfered with the cytosolic entry of virus through low pH-dependent fashion. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of exogenously expressed IFITM3 protein restricting infection of an enveloped DNA virus, thus expanding their antiviral spectrum. This study further explores the complex mechanism and provides novel insights into the interaction between virus infection and host defense.",

        "abstract": "Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses by blocking their entry. In this study, we constructed a shuttle plasmid, harboring human IFITM3. Thereafter, recombinant adenovirus rAd5-IFITM3 was obtained by co-transfection of the linearized viral backbone vector pAd5 and the shuttle plasmid. The results showed that human IFITM3 did not affect the assembly and morphogenesis of progeny adenovirus. Human IFITM3 can be expressed in both A549 and MDCK cells in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, cells infected with rAd5-IFITM3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for 24\u202fh were challenged with avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 at an MOI of 1 for 6, 12 and 24\u202fh. Rates of H5N1 infection in rAd5-IFITM3 cells were significantly decreased at 24\u202fh post-infection (hpi), in a time dependent manner, compared with that of wild type wtAd5-infected cells. The expressions of viral genes were significantly inhibited at transcriptional and translational levels at 6 and 12\u202fhpi. These results suggest that IFITM3 can suppress H5N1 replication in the early stage of the infection, which may be used as a promise agent against H5N1 infection in vivo.",

With the observed aurora data growing quickly, aurora morphology research becomes data intensive. This paper presents a big aurora data management framework toward aurora classification analysis considering the scalability and performance. The framework integrates aurora data acquisition and management, aurora data preprocessing, data query and explore, and aurora classification experiment management. The NoSQL database is employed to manage the aurora data and the classification experiment data. The in-memory index is constructed to support the in-situ analysis.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning task is a routine process including data collection, feature engineering, model training, hyper-parameters tuning, model evaluation and model deployment. The process is usually complex, iterated and time-consuming. Commonly, researchers seldom start building the machine model from scratch. They may select some well-known and well-trained models in similar task domains as the reference models. Then they try to tune the hyper-parameters and accelerate the iteration. Thus, some models are often reused and need to be reproduced by using new training dataset. Moreover, understanding the model and the iteration is more necessary. This scenario is very similar to that of software reuse. In this poster, we propose  Modelware  and argue the need of  Modelware  to make the machine learning model reusable and reproducible. We define the  Modelware  which is the reused object and develop a model repository to provide the model lineage management and model visit tool. The big data for building model is managed collaboratively so that the model can be reproduced. The iteration process to obtain the final optimized model is abstracted and implemented using a lightweight workflow. Finally, we take two different classification tasks as the demonstration.",

Effects of subphase pH, temperature and ionic strength on the isotherms and hysteresis curves of the PnBA-b-PAA monolayers and the morphologies of its LB films were systematically studied. With the increase of subphase pH, the isotherms shift negatively and the quasi-plateaus disappear under neutral and alkaline conditions. Hysteresis phenomena of the PnBA-b-PAA monolayers on acidic and neutral subphases are quite obvious and similar, while the compression and expansion isotherms under alkaline condition are almost overlapped. The LB films of PnBA-b-PAA transferred from acidic subphase exhibit isolated circular micelles with large size, while those from alkaline subphase exhibit condensed ones with small size. With the rise in subphase temperature, PnBA blocks on the water surface are more likely to aggregate into large cores due to the higher molecular mobility. Furthermore, the totally ringlike nanostructures prepared from alkaline subphase with medium ionic strength are observed for the first time in LB films of block copolymers.",

        "abstract": "UHF is one of the effective methods which could detect partial discharge in GIS. However, more and more GIS have insulator of metal enclosed structure which leads UHF electromagnetic wave caused by partial discharge could not pass through the insulator. Fortunately, there are little slits between the metal band and the GIS shell which maybe lets higher frequency electromagnetic wave pass. It is possible to detect the partial discharge for GIS with metal enclosed insulator structure by higher frequency. In this paper, we measured the GIS equipment in the laboratory, set up the 1:1 model of GIS equipment based on the measured data. By the simulation software, we simulated the GIS partial discharge by giving a Gaussian pulse signal which is similar to the partial discharge, got the electromagnetic wave spectrum which can spread through the slits between the metal band and the GIS shell. On the basis of the data of the electromagnetic wave spectrum which can be detected, we designed an antenna which could be used for the detection of GIS with metal enclosed insulator structure. With usage of HFSS electromagnetic simulation software, we built up models of two kinds of sensors and repeatedly changed the size of the antenna to the optimal structure according to the simulation optimization data. At last, we got the standing wave ratio direction, radiation pattern, and 3D polar plot of the two sensors. Considering factors such as structural features and portable use, we compared the two kinds of antenna performance difference. The results show that the electromagnetic wave spectrum which can be detected of GIS partial discharge is 0.5\u20134 GHz, and in this band, the micro-strip antenna is more suitable than equiangular spiral antenna in the detection of partial discharge in GIS.",

In this paper, various aged transformer pressboard samples from un-aged to 40 years old were prepared by accelerated thermal aging method at 130 centigrade degree. Moisture equilibrium tests of paper samples with and without small molecule acid immersed in un-aged oil were carried out under the conditions of 80 centigrade degree, 60% relative humidity of air atmosphere. The results showed that the effect of small molecule acids increases with the deepening of aging. The effect of small molecule acid on moisture adsorption of 40-year-aged paper was 16.6%, 9 times of un-aged paper.",

The composites were characterized by XPS and TEM images, which confirmed the presence of GO and Au nanoparticles on the PDPB. The as-prepared Au-GO/PDPB composites displayed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with that of pure PDPB for the synchronous photoreduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and photo-oxidation of phenol. We also determined the optimal loading mass of GO and Au nanoparticles on the PDPB; the Au 1 -GO2/PDPB (2.0 wt% GO and 1.0 wt% Au) composite displayed the best photocatalytic activity among all the catalysts.

In this study, we successfully prepared a PDPB/SnO2 p\u2013n heterojunction by an in situ growth route. The XPS characterization indicates the generation of Sn\u2013C bonds between SnO2 and PDPB, which would decrease the bandgap of SnO2 and promote the transference efficiency of electrons and holes between these two components. The PDPB could act as the sensitizer to enlarge the solar light absorption region of the heterojunction. The SnO2 provides a stable mesoporous structure and enhanced hydrophilic properties. The solar-driven photodegradation rate of Rhodamine B over the PDPB/SnO2 (ratio is 2\u2006:\u20061) is 4 times higher than that of the pure SnO2 and 2 times higher than that of the pure PDPB nanofibers. Our strategy gives a facile strategy for the preparation of an organic\u2013inorganic hybrid heterojunction with high solar light activity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Optimization of coverage control strategy for spatial ecological nodes and the correct evaluation of the stability of spatial ecological network structure are the basis for understanding and optimizing the ecological network structure. The excellent ecological network structure, especially in arid and semi-arid regions in northwest China, is the basis of sustainable development of regional ecological environment. Based on this, Deng Kou County, the typical ecological vulnerable zone, was chosen as the study area. Minimum cumulative resistance model improved by emergy theory was used to extract the ecological network, and a new spatial layout strategy based on Tyson blind zone was constructed to optimize the spatial layout of ecological nodes. In the aspect of ecological network stability, the connectivity robustness and recovery robustness index were used to analyze structural robustness of un-optimized and optimized ecological network. The results showed that the spatial distribution of ecological source nodes at level 3, 4, and 5 with higher emergy value formed the desertification protection pattern. 1058 ecological nodes and 47,466 ecological corridors were extracted at the county level, which formed the ecological network in Deng Kou County. After optimization, the coverage area of ecological nodes reached 1870.03\u00a0km 2 , and the area of Tyson blind spot was reduced to 1179.27\u00a0km 2 . Compared with the un-optimized ecological nodes, the spatial distribution of the optimized ecological nodes was more homogeneous, the coverage index ( CR ) of the optimized ecological nodes reached 87.79%, and the distribution uniformity ( U ) of optimized ecological nodes was reduced to 0.3978. Based on the above, the robustness of the un-optimized and optimized ecological network structure was analyzed. The initial connectivity robustness of the un-optimized ecological network was 0.73, but the optimized ecological network was 1. The optimized network was more stable than the un-optimized network. For these two kinds of networks, the malicious attack was more destructive than the random attack. The node recovery robustness and edge recovery robustness under random attack were superior to those of the malicious attack. In summary, the spatial layout optimization of the ecological nodes improved the stability of the ecological network in Deng Kou County. This analysis provided insights that will support planning to adjust the ecological spatial structure and future sustainable development of ecological environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Land is one of the basic resources and it is significant for the survival of human beings and the development of society. In the arid desert area where the ecological environment is fragile, land resource often faces the pressure from ecological degradation and economic development. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the sustainability of land resource, which is beneficial for the rational operation of the regional ecology economic system. The sustainability of land resources of Dengkou County, Bayannaoer, China was studied based on the social and economic statistics data and land use data from 1998 to 2015. The result showed that from 1998 to 2015, the impact of human exploitation activities on the land resource had been intensified and the area of cultivated land and construction land increased evidently. This change led to a slow but continuous decline of the sustainability of the land resources in Dengkou. Based on the research above, land use evolution of Dengkou in a hundred years under two different development strategies\u2014efficiency dominant strategy and ecology dominant strategy was simulated using an improved cellular automata (CA) model built in this research. Emergy analysis was also performed based on the simulation results. The results showed that under the efficiency dominant strategy the economy would grow rapidly but the sustainability of the land resources would be damaged greatly. Under the ecology dominant strategy, the development of economy would be stagnant, while the sustainability of land resources would be maintained. The results of the study indicated that the maintaining of the sustainability of land resources and the development of economy should be achieved simultaneously by industrial upgrading and technological innovation, while simple industrial expansion will lead to a decline in the sustainability of land resources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The coalcrete, a new supporting material produced by jet grouting (JG) technique was firstly studied for improving soft coal mass to support roadways in Guobei coal mine, China. Youngu0027s modulus is an essential indicator to evaluate the deformation-resisting ability of coalcretes. In this study, for determining Youngu0027s modulus of coalcretes efficiently, an intelligent technique was proposed using the support vector machine (SVM) and beetle antennae search (BAS). The hyper-parameters of SVM were firstly tuned by BAS, and then the SVM-BAS model with optimum hyper-parameters was employed to model the non-linear relationship between the inputs (coal content, water content, cement content, and curing time) and output (Youngu0027s modulus). By combining these variables, 360 coalcrete samples in total were prepared and tested for establishing the dataset. The results show that BAS is more reliable and efficient than the trial\u2013and\u2013error tuning method. Moreover, by comparison with other baseline models such as back-propagation neural network (BPNN), logistic regression (LR) and multiple linear regression (MLR), the optimized SVM-BAS model is more reliable, accurate and less time consuming for predicting Youngu0027s modulus of coalcretes. Besides, by conducting sensitivity analysis (SA), the importance of different input variables was determined. This pioneering work provides guidelines for predicting Youngu0027s modulus of coalcretes and designing proper JG parameters in engineering applications.",

        "abstract": "DNA copy number (DCN) is the number of copies of DNA at a region of a genome. The alterations of DCN are highly associated with the development of different tumors. Recently, microarray technologies are being employed to detect DCN changes at many loci at the same time in tumor samples. The resulting DCN data are often very noisy, and the tumor sample is often contaminated by normal cells. The goal of computational analysis of array-based DCN data is to infer the underlying DCNs from raw DCN data. Previous methods for this task do not model the tumor/normal cell mixture ratio explicitly and they cannot output segments with DCN annotations. We developed a novel model-based method using the minimum description length (MDL) principle for DCN data segmentation. Our new method can output underlying DCN for each chromosomal segment, and at the same time, infer the underlying tumor proportion in the test samples. Empirical results show that our method achieves better accuracies on average as compared to three previous methods, namely Circular Binary Segmentation, Hidden Markov Model and Ultrasome.",

Effective ma- chine learning models for this task can be useful not only for cancer diagnosis, but also for discovering novel tumor sup- pressor genes and oncogenes. The recent array-based as- says that detect DNA copy numbers contain very large num- bers of probes and thus generate data of extremely high di- mensionality. Therefore, the use of appropriate feature re- duction methods is called for. In this paper, we proposed an efficient interval tree based feature reduction method for cancer classification using DNA copy number data. Instead of using probes as features, our approach extracts intervals as features from the original probe data. Experiment re- sults on two real data sets showed that our approach led to statistically significantly better classification accuracies as compared to the based line approach where the DNA copy number data at probe loci were used as features directly.",

        "abstract": "A framework is given for evaluation assurance level 4 (EAL4) security requirements for radio frequency identification (RFID) active tags in applications for the Internet of Things (IOT). The evaluation assurance level and the security assurance requirements are chosen based on ISO/IEC standard 15 408 and an analysis of the asset value and potential threat. Then, the potential threats are related to the active tags to set security objectives for the target to resist potential attacks. A minimal set of security function requirements is given to specify the functionality of active tags. Finally, the consistency between the abstractions is analyzed to justify the rationale behind the framework. This work provides a reference for designers of security mechanisms for active tags and a basis for the evaluation and procurement of active tags.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Two-dimensional, high-resolution, numerical solutions for the classical formulation and two widely accepted nonequilibrium models of multiphase flow through porous media are generated and compared with experimental observations from literature. Flow equations for simultaneous flow of two immiscible phases through porous media are written in a vorticity stream-function form. In the resulting system of equations, the vorticity stream-function equation is solved using a spectral method and the transport equation is discretized in space using a central-upwind scheme. The system of equations is solved for a two-dimensional domain using a semi-implicit time-stepper. The solutions reveal behavior that is not apparent in one-dimensional solutions, namely that sharpening of the saturation front caused by the inclusion of a dynamic capillary pressure results in propagation of viscous fingers compared to the classical formulation. The inclusion of nonequilibrium effects in the constitutive relations, in the form of effective saturation, introduces dispersion and smears the otherwise highly resolved viscous fingers in the saturation front. Once developed, the length of the mixing zone in the numerical solutions remains constant with time regardless of the degree of instability. This is contrary to the evolution of the mixing zone observed in unstable flow experiments where, unlike the numerical solutions, the propagation speed of the leading edge of the front appears to increase with time.",
