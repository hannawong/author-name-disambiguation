        "abstract": "A simple photoelectrochemical method was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the electron transport process of photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of water at vertically aligned nanotubular TiO2 photoanodes. The photoelectrocatalysis reaction resistance (R=k/J(sph)+R(0)=R(I)+R(0)) was measured and used to express the electron transport characteristics of a nanotubular TiO(2) electrode. The overall resistance was found to consist of a variant (R(I)) and an invariant component (R(0)). R(I) was found to be inversely proportional to the saturation photocurrent and it depends on the experimental conditions. The proportional constant, k, represents the minimum applied potential bias required to remove 100 % of the photogenerated electrons from the photocatalyst layer and was found to be independent of the anodization time. The invariant component of the resistance (R(0)) is an inherent property of the semiconductor photocatalyst that represents the sum of Ohmic contact impedance at the conducting substrate/TiO2 interface and crystalline boundary impedance. The magnitude of R(0) linearly increased with anodization time. The real saturated photocurrent density (J(real-sphd)) was found to be independent of R(0) indicating that the electron collection efficiency is independent of the nanotube length.",

        "abstract": "A diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique for measuring Cd and Cu is described using, for the first time, a liquid phase binding layer and a dialysis membrane diffusive layer. The binding phase was a 0.020 M solution of poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) polyelectrolyte using a specially designed DGT deployment device. The binding properties of Cd2+, Cu2+, and a range of alkali and alkaline earth metal ions to the PSS solution were characterized. The PSS behaved like a cation exchanger with preferential binding to Cd2+ (6.0 micromol mL(-1), log K = 9.0) and Cu2+ (2.5 micromol mL(-1), log K = 8.1) under competitive binding conditions. PSS had a substantial binding capacity at pH > 3 and at competitive Na+ concentrations up to 1.0 M. The DGT devices were successfully validated for Cd2+ (accumulated mass vs time r2 = 0.969, recovery compared with predicted values = 98%) and Cu2+ (r2 = 0.980, recovery = 98%) in synthetic lake water (Windermere). Validation was also undertaken for Cu in a spiked local lake water (Parkwood Pond) (r2 = 0.981, recovery = 46%). The low recovery here was due to complexation of Cu by natural organic matter (14 mg C L(-1)). Field deployments of the DGT devices were successful at measuring Cu concentrations of 0.031-0.63 microg L(-1) in local fresh and salt waterways. These DGT-labile measurements were 0.05-39% of the 0.45-microm-filtered Cu values.",

The performance of the LTHB and RTHB in terms of COD removal efficiency, dehydrogenase activity and functional diversity of microbial communities were evaluated. The results show COD removal efficiency increased gradually over time from 39.76% to 66.27% for LTHB and fluctuated between 81.85% and 94.78% for RTHB. The dehydrogenase activity and microbial activity in LTHB was higher than those in RTHB, implying that microorganisms cultured at low temperature had higher activities and adaptabilities than those cultured at room temperature. This study suggests that hybrid bioreactors can treat wastewater at both low and room temperatures and provides valuable insight into the adaptation processes of the microorganisms during temperature changes.",

        "abstract": "Four types of TiO 2 thin-film electrodes were fabricated from TiO 2 and Fe(III) doped TiO 2 sols using a layer-by-layer dip-coating technique. Electrodes fabricated were TF (pure TiO 2 surface, Fe(III)-TiO 2 bottom layer), FT (Fe(III)-TiO 2 surface, pure TiO 2 bottom layer), TT (both layers pure TiO 2) and FF (both layers Fe(III)-TiO 2). The photoelectrochemical behavior of these electrodes was characterized using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and steady-state photocurrent measurements in aqueous 0.1 mol L -1 NaNO 3 containing varying concentrations of glucose or potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP). EIS and LSV results revealed that exciton separation efficiency followed the sequence of TF > TT > FT > FF. Under a constant potential of +0.3 V, steady-state photocurrent profiles were recorded with varying organic compound concentrations. The TF electrode possessed the greatest photocatalytic capacity for oxidizing glucose and KHP, and possessed a KHP anti-poisoning effect. Enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the TF electrode was attributed to effective exciton separation because of the layered TF structure. \u00a9 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

A UV-LED light source and a USB mircroelectrochemical station are powered and controlled by a laptop computer, which makes the probe portable for onsite COD analyses. The photoelectrochemical measurement of COD was optimized in terms of light intensity, applied bias, and pH. Under the optimized conditions, the net steady state currents originated from the oxidation of organic compounds were found to be directly proportional to COD concentrations. A practical detection limit of 0.2 ppm COD and a linear range of 0-120 ppm COD were achieved. The analytical method using the portable PeCOD probe has the advantages of being rapid, low cost, robust, user-friendly, and environmental friendly. It has been successfully applied to determine the COD values of the synthetic samples consisting of potassium hydrogen phthalate, D-glucose, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid, and real samples from various industries, such as bakery, oil and grease manufacturer, poultry, hotel, fine food factory, and fresh food producer, commercial bread manufacturer. Excellent agreement between the proposed method and the conventional COD method (dichromate) was achieved.",

The resultant thin film was used for the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The compact layer typically has a thickness of ca. 110 nm as indicated by its SEM, and consists of anatase as confirmed by the XRD pattern. Compared with the traditional DSSCs without this compact layer, the solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency, short-circuit current and open-circuit potential of the DSSCs with the compact layer were improved by 33.3%, 20.3%, and 10.2%, respectively. This can be attributed to the merits brought by the compact layer. It can effectively improve adherence of TiO 2 to FTO surface, provide a larger TiO 2 /FTO contact area, and reduce the electron recombination by blocking the direct contact between the redox electrolyte and the conductive FTO surface.",

In this study, 22 surface forest soils (0\u201310\u00a0cm)\n were collected from southeast Queensland, Australia, to investigate the size of SON pools extracted by water and salt solutions.\n Approximately 5\u201345\u00a0mg SON kg\u22121, 2\u201342\u00a0mg SON kg\u22121 and 1\u201324 SON mg\u00a0kg\u22121 were extracted by 2\u00a0M KCl, 0.5\u00a0M K2SO4 and water, on average, corresponding to about 21.1, 13.5 and 7.0\u00a0kg SON ha\u22121 at the 0\u201310\u00a0cm forest soils, respectively.

Large variation in SON pools observed across the sites\n in the present study may be attributed to a combination of factors including soil types, tree species, management practices\n and environmental conditions. Significant relationships were observed among the SON pools extracted by water, KCl and K2SO4 and microbial biomass N (MBN). In general, KCl and K2SO4 extracted more SON than water from the forest soils, while KCl extracted more SON than K2SO4. The SON and soluble organic C (SOC) in KCl, K2SO4 and water extracts were all positively related to soil organic C, total N and clay contents. This indicates that clay and\n soil organic matter play a key role in the retention of SON in soil.",

        "abstract": "A simple, rapid, and sensitive on-line chemical oxygen demand (COD) determination method has been proposed and experimentally validated. The method is based on a photoelectrochemical oxidative degradation principle and operates under a continuous flow mode. The method employs a specially designed thin-layer photoelectrochemical cell that incorporates a highly effective nanoparticulate TiO2 photoanode. This approach overcomes many problems associated with the conventional COD determination techniques such as long analysis time, consumption of expensive and toxic reagents, production of secondary toxic waste, and poor reproducibility. The effect of important experimental parameters on the analytical signal generation was systematically investigated, and the optimum conditions were obtained. The method was successfully applied to determine the COD of real samples from various industrial wastewaters. The COD value of real samples determined by this method agreed well with the standard dichromate method. The assay time of 1-5 min/sample can be readily achieved. A practical detection limit of 1 mg L(-1) COD with a linear range of 1-100 mg L(-1) was achieved under the optimum conditions.",

        "abstract": "There are growing research interests in developing high-performance energy storage systems to meet the demands for large-scale and sustainable energy storage. The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have drawn numerous attentions due to their exceptionally high energy density compared with other batteries. However, achieving the high capacities with long-term cycle stability and retaining an essentially high sulfur loading remains a tremendous challenge for the designs of Li-S batteries. Graphene is regarded as a very suitable and promising addition to the compositions for Li-S batteries due to its unique two dimensional (2D) structure, high conductivity and superior mechanical flexibility. Besides, the functional groups of graphene surface can be tuned flexibly to immobilize the S/Li2Sx on the graphene surface during the cycling process. In this review, the development of graphene-sulfur composites and their applications in Li-S batteries are discussed. The attempts are also devoted to the synthesis approaches of various graphene-based sulfur composites, the graphene-sulfur interaction and the impacts on the electrochemical performances as well as the major issues of Li-S batteries.",

Herein, we report for the first time of a new yolk-shell structured high tap density composite made of a carbon-coated rigid SiO2 outer shell to confine multiple Si NPs (yolks) and CNTs with embedded Fe2O3 NPs. The achieved high tap density and superior conductivity can be attributed to the efficiently utilized inner void by multiple Si yolks, Fe2O3 NPs and CNTs Li+ storage materials, and the bridged spaces between the inner Si yolks and outer shell through a conductive CNTs 'highway'. Half cells can achieve a high area capacity of 3.6 mAh cm-2 and 95 % reversible capacity retention after 450 cycles. The full cell constructed using Li-rich Li2V2O5 cathode can achieve a high reversible capacity of 260 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles.",

The preliminary results from scanning electron microscopy suggest that the obtained TiO2 nanowire array was rooted directly on the titanium substrate, while the X-ray diffraction indicated that it consists of rutile nanocrystals without the need for calcination. In comparison with rutile nanorod array (RNR-TiO2) photoanode grown on a FTO glass substrate, the as-prepared rutile nanowire array (RNW-TiO2) photoanode shows higher photoelectrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of organic compounds. The as-prepared RNW-TiO2 photoanodes are capable of oxidizing a wide spectrum of organic compounds such as glucose, fructose, glutaric acid, malonic acid, and glycine indiscriminately in aqueous solutions in a bulk photoelectrochemical cell. An excellent linear relationship between the obtained net photocurrents and the equivalent concentrations of organic compounds suggests that the RNW-TiO2 photoanode could be a versatile sensor for the determination of organic compounds. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The resultant nanotubes display external diameters of 50-80 nm and walls with an average thickness of 10 nm that consist of more than 10 titanate layers. This is in strong contrast to the titanate nanotubes obtained from alkaline liquid-phase hydrothermal methods, which are generally smaller than 12 nm in external diameter and have walls consisting of less than five titanate layers. Importantly, the investigation confirmed that under vapor-phase hydrothermal conditions, the nanotubes were formed via a distinctive nanosheet roll-up mechanism that differs remarkably from those of conventional liquid-phase hydrothermal processes. For the first time, a coaxial circular cylinder crystal structure of the resultant nanotubes was confirmed.",

The samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible diffusion reflection spectroscopy. This Cu(2)O/TNTs film photocatalyst is capable of complete inactivation of Escherichia coli in 5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7) colony-forming units/mL within a record short disinfection time of 20 min under visible-light irradiation. The average bactericidal percentage of the Cu(2)O/TNTs for E. coli under visible-light irradiation are 20 times and 6.6 times higher than those of TNTs under the same conditions and Cu(2)O/TNTs without light, respectively. This superior bactericidal performance is mainly attributed to the high ability to produce OH radicals by both photogenerated electron and hole of the prepared photocatalyst under visible light. The Cu(2)O/TNTs film photocatalyst makes it applicable to broad fields including drinking water disinfection.",

        "abstract": "Prussian blue nanoparticles were synthesized by employing polymyxin B/sodium bis(2-ethylexyl) sulfosuccinate/water/ isooctane reverse microemulsion. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical methods were used to characterize the resultant nanoparticles, that were subsequently used to fabricate prussian blue-based glucose biosensors. Prussian blue nanoparticles were assembled onto a cysteine-modified Au electrode surface and then glutaraldehyde was used to cross-link glucose oxidase on the Prussian blue modified electrode. Both the electrochemical properties of Prussian blue and biocatalytical performance of glucose oxidase were investigated using cyclic voltammetry. After the biosensors were optimized, the glucose biosensors had a linear range from 6.7 \u03bcMto 2.0 mM and a relative standard deviation of 4.38%.\u00a9 Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co. KG.",

        "abstract": "Ammonia is a necessary monitoring parameter that should be controlled within an optimum range in the whole process of wastewater treatment and recycling, but few reliable real-time monitoring technologies are available currently under such harsh water conditions. This study proposes a continuous conductometric flow-through analyzer for ammonia monitoring (CFAA) in the wastewater treatment process. It is developed based on the gas diffusion mechanisms, and the proposed analytical principle has been validated in which the real-time conductivity increment rate is linearly proportional to the real-time ammonia concentration in the sample. This method could be generally applicable in monitoring a wide ammonia concentration range (10.2 \u03bcg L to 500 mg L), and it is capable of achieving long-term ammonia monitoring by periodic renewal of the receiving solution. The potential impact factors and corresponding calibration principles are also developed to avoid tedious ongoing calibration. The field application results demonstrate that CFAA can effectively and directly achieve real-time and average ammoniacal nitrogen monitoring at different treatment stages regardless of the complexity of wastewater, not requiring any sample pretreatment. Compared with other ammonia online monitoring technologies, the proposed CFAA shows remarkable advantages in high reliability, durability, and accuracy, especially under severe monitoring condition. It can be a useful monitoring tool for continuous ammonia control in the wastewater treatment process.",

Toluene was chosen as a representative pollutant of VOCs to investigate the degradation mechanism\n and the parameters affecting photocatalytic degradation efficiency. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the\n degradation efficiency of toluene increased with the increase of the light irradiation dosage, while it decreased with the\n increase of concentrations of toluene. The degradation efficiency increased rapidly with the increase of the relative humidity\n in a low humidity range from 0 to 35%, but decreased gradually in a high relative humidity (i.e., >35%). The optimum experimental\n conditions for toluene degradation is a toluene concentration of 106\u00a0mg\u00a0m\u22123, a relative humidity of 35%, and an illumination intensity of ca. 6\u00a0mW cm\u22122 at the surface of ZnO/SnO2 photocatalysts. The intermediates produced during the gaseous photocatalytic degradation process were identified using the\n GC\u2013MS technique. Based on these identified intermediates, the photocatalytic mechanism of toluene into ZnO/SnO2 coupled oxide catalyst was also deduced.",

        "abstract": "An organic lanthanum solution was prepared and used for modifying the nanoporous TiO(2) photoanode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The preliminary characterization results demonstrate that La(2)O(3) was formed on the surface of the TiO(2) photoanodes. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses suggest that La(3+) was introduced into the TiO(2) nanocrystalline, while, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tunnelling electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations suggest that a thin La(2)O(3) layer forms on surface of the TiO(2) nanostructure. The La(2)O(3) layer is able to alleviate the electron recombination as a passivation layer. Though the slight decrease in surface areas were induced by the surface modification, the dye loading were maintained, which can be attributed to the formation of strong co-ordination bonding between the dye molecules and the lanthanide. The bonding can also facilitate the electron transfer between the dye molecules and TiO(2) conduction band. Consequently, the open circuit potential and short circuit current were boosted significantly and the overall energy conversion efficiency of the DSSCs was remarkably improved from 6.84% for the control film to 9.67% for the La(3+)-modified film.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The practical application of Li-S batteries is inherently limited by the low conductivity of sulfur and the dissolution of polysulfides. The enhancement of conductivity and introduction of polarity to the sulfur host is an effective strategy to overcome these long-standing challenges. In this work, a facile one-step carbonizing process is used to synthesize a unique porous and conductive nanocomposite where Fe 3 C nanoparticles are embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheets (Fe 3 C@NPCS). As demonstrated in Li 2 S 4  adsorption experiments and confirmed by density functional theory calculations, Fe 3 C nanoparticles are able to strongly adsorb polysulfides via strong Fe-S chemical bonds. Due to the remarkable conductivity, Fe 3 C nanoparticles can also accelerate the electrochemical reactions of the polysulfides through fast electron transportation. The carbon sheets prevent the aggregation of Fe 3 C nanoparticles and accommodate sulfur and its volume expansion during charge/discharge processes. With these features, the resultant sulfur cathodes (Fe 3 C@NPCS-S) deliver an excellent cycling performance with a capacity decay of 0.036% per cycle, and high rate performance of ca. 1127, 1020, 907, 802, 731 and 647\u202fmAh\u202fg \u22121  under current densities of 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5\u202fC, respectively.",

        "abstract": "To understand the role of ubiquitous phototrophic periphyton in aquatic ecosystem on the biogeochemical cycling of organic phosphorus, the conversion and removal kinetic characteristics of organic phosphorus (Porg) such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were investigated in the presence of the periphyton cultured in artificial non-point source wastewater. The preliminary results showed that the periphyton was very powerful in converting Porg evidenced by the fact that inorganic phosphorus (Pinorg) content in solution increased from about 0.7 to 14.3 mg P L(-1) in 48 hours in the presence of 0.6 g L(-1) periphyton. This was because the periphyton could produce abundant phosphatases that benefited the conversion of Porg to Pinrog. Moreover, this conversion process was described more suitable by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The periphyton was also effective in removing Porg, which showed that the Porg can be completely removed even when the initial Porg concentration was as high as 13 mg P L(-1) in 48 hours in the presence of 1.6 g L(-1) periphyton. Furthermore, it was found that biosorption dominated the Porg removal process and exhibited the characteristics of physical adsorption. However, this biosorption process by the periphyton was significantly influenced by biomass (absorbent dosage) and temperature. This work provides insights into Porg biogeochemical circulation of aquatic ecosystem that contained the periphyton or similar microbial aggregates.",

        "abstract": "Anatase TiO(2) microspheres with controlled surface morphologies and exposed crystal facets were directly synthesized on metal titanium foil substrates by means of a facile, one-pot hydrothermal method without use of any templating reagent. The obtained products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelecron spectroscopy (XPS), and the focused ion beam (FIB) technique. The sizes of the resultant microspheres ranged from 1.1 to 2.1 \u03bcm. The transformation of anatase TiO(2) microspheres with exposed {001} facets surface to nanosheets surface with {101} facets was achieved by simply controlling the hydrothermal reaction time. The anatase TiO(2) microspheres with exposed square-shaped plane {001} facets were obtained by controlling the reaction time at 1 h. The prolonged reaction time transforms the anatase TiO(2) microspheres with exposed square-shaped plane {001} facets to eroded {001} facets then to a nanosheet surface with exposed {101} facets. With hydrothermal synthesis, the surface morphological structure and crystal facets formation are highly dependent on dissolution/deposition processes, which can be strongly influenced by attributes, such as pH of the reaction media, the total concentration of dissolved and suspended titanium species, and the concentration of fluoride in the reaction solution. The changes of these attributes during the hydrothermal process were therefore measured and used to illustrate the morphology and crystal-facet transformation processes of anatase TiO(2) microspheres. The surface morphologies and crystal-facet transformations during hydrothermal processes were found to be governed by the compositional changes of the reaction media, driven by dynamically shifted dissolution/deposition equilibria. The photocatalytic activities of the photoanodes made of anatase TiO(2) microspheres were evaluated. The experimental results demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO(2) microspheres with exposed {001} facets was found to be 1.5 times higher than that of the anatase TiO(2) microspheres with exposed {101} facets.",

        "title": "A low cost universal photoelectrochemical detector for organic compounds based on photoelectrocatalytic oxidation at a nanostructured TiO2 photoanode",
        "abstract": "A photoelectrochemical detector (PECD) was developed for determination of organic compounds in flow injection analysis (FIA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based on the extraordinary oxidation power of nanostructured TiO 2 photoanodes under UV illumination. The PECD is a simple, small, and compact photoelectrochemical cell consisting of low cost components such as a TiO 2 nanostructured photoanode and a UV-LED. Compared with conventional FIA and HPLC selective detectors, such as UV\u2013Vis detector, electrochemical detector and fluorescent detector, the PECD has the advantage of being low cost, non-selective and sensitive. Using the FIA mode, the analytical principle of the PECD was demonstrated by detecting a large variety of organic compounds, such as sugars, amino acids, alcohol, straight chain carboxylic acids, and aromatic carboxylic acid. The PECD was subsequently coupled with a typical FIA and HPLC system for the determination of sugars. For the application in FIA, under the optimum experimental conditions, the linear ranges for glucose and sucrose were 25\u2013600 \u03bcM and 25\u2013500 \u03bcM, respectively, with the same detection limit of 10 \u03bcM. When the PECD was coupled with a HPLC system, the linear range for both glucose and sucrose was 7.5\u2013200 mM with the same detection limit of 1 mM under the optimal experimental conditions. Keywords TiO 2 Photoelectrochemical detector High performance liquid chromatography Nanostructure 1 Introduction Flow injection analysis (FIA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have become two of the most common analytical techniques in many fields, such as in pharmaceutical, environmental, forensic, clinical, food, flavour sciences and relative industries [1\u20134] . The availability of a large variety of detectors supports the applications of the FIA and HPLC. The detectors can be classified into specific or non-specific (i.e., universal) detectors [5] . Nowadays, the most common detectors, such as UV\u2013Vis detectors, photodiode array detectors, amperometric electrochemical detectors, fluorescent detectors, are specific detectors, only giving response to the specific properties of the analytes. Mass spectroscopy (MS) detectors and reflective index detectors (RID) are more universal. But the MS detectors are extremely more expensive and are not sensitive to low molecular weight compounds [1] while RID commonly has unsatisfactory sensitivity [6] . Low cost and sensitive universal detectors are ideal for chromatographic application. In this regards, the flame ionization detector (FID) for gas chromatography (GC) is a good representative. The development of low cost and sensitive universal detectors is much needed to expand the applications of FIA and HPLC. Since the discovery by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 of water cleavage using TiO 2 film photoanode under an anodic potential bias and UV illumination [7] , considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of high efficient TiO 2 film. In sensing applications, TiO 2 films have been widely studied as sensors for various gases, such as H 2 , O 2 , CO, NO x , ethanol, acetone, liquefied petroleum gas, and toluene [8\u201310] . Additionally, combined with the immobilization of enzyme, TiO 2 based biosensor can be applied in determination of glucose with high sensitivity and fast response time [11] . It also has been reported that TiO 2 films can be used for different ions sensing, including the pH sensing with TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si structure [12] , and mercury ions determination with the molecularly imprinted TiO 2 thin film [13] . The most significant attraction of using the TiO 2 photocatalyst is the strong oxidation power of the TiO 2 photoanode. It is well-established that the oxidation power is stemmed from the photohole generated under UV light. Because of this, a wide spectrum of organic compounds can be stoichiometrically mineralized (see Eq. (1) ). (1) C y H m O j N k X q + ( 2 y - j ) H 2 O \u2192 y CO 2 + q X - + k NH 3 + ( 4 y - 2 j + m - 3 k ) H + + ( 4 y - 2 j + m - 3 k - q ) e - The number of electrons captured in this process is the oxidation number ( n = 4 y \u2212 2 j + m \u2212 3 k \u2212 q) . When the electrochemistry technique is combined with photocatalysis, the oxidation power of the TiO 2 thin film can be dramatically enhanced. Electrochemical instrument such as potentiostat can not only provide electric field to suppress the recombination of photoelectron and photohole (and improve the oxidation efficiency further), but also measure the photocurrent generated from this process for quantitative analysis [14] . The photocatalytic oxidation property at the TiO 2 surface has been incorporated into detectors for application in HPLC [15] . Fox and Tien attempted to develop a flow-through photoelectrochemical detector for HPLC. UV illumination source was used to initiate a photoelectrocatalytic oxidation reaction to detect organic compounds. The detection limits for aniline, benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol were 1.6 \u03bcg, 4.9 \u03bcg and 210 \u03bcg, respectively [15] . However, this detector has limited application due to the following factors. Firstly, this TiO 2 electrode can react with hydroxylic eluents such as water and methanol leading to extremely high background current [15] , which limits its applications in reversed-phase HPLC. Secondly, this system has high building and maintenance cost due to the use of mercury lamp as the UV light source. Thirdly, the instability of the mercury lamp can commonly distort analytical signals and result in noisy response. Brown et al. reported a photoelectrochemical detector for HPLC which was based on the TiO 2 wire electrode along a cylindrical electrochemical cell [16] . It could detect a variety of organic compounds including amines, aromatic alcohols, hydroquinones, aldehydes and furans, but could not sensitively detect sugars, aliphatic ketones and aliphatic esters due to the insufficient power of the TiO 2 electrode [16] . In this work, a photoelectrochemical detector (PECD) was developed to determine organic compounds universally for FIA and HPLC systems. This is based on the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation reaction of organic compounds at the TiO 2 nanostructured photoanode (see Eq. (1) ). A low cost, long-life and small UV-LED was used to provide UV illumination instead of expensive, instable and high running cost xenon lamp or mercury lamp [17\u201319] . To optimize the analytical performance of the detector, the effects of important experimental parameters such as applied potentials, light intensity, flow rate and injection volume, on the analytical signals were systematically investigated using pure organic compound in the FIA system. The analytical principle of this universal detector was demonstrated by measuring various types of organic compounds, and the analytical performance of the FIA\u2013PECD was evaluated under the optimized experimental conditions. To illustrate the advantage of the PECD over the conventional HPLC detector (e.g. UV\u2013Vis detector), the PECD was coupled with a HPLC system (i.e., HPLC\u2013PECD) and used to determine the sugars separated by the HPLC reverse phase column. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials The indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass slides (8 \u03a9/square) were supplied by Delta Technologies Ltd. Titanium butoxide (97%), nitric acid, isopropanol, carbowax 20 M, glucose, sucrose, fructose, tryptophan, glycine, threonine, propionic acid, butyric acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid, phthalic acid, sodium nitrate were purchased from Aldrich without further treatment prior to use. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Aldrich unless otherwise stated. High-purity deionized water (Millipore Corp., 18 M\u03a9 cm) was used in the preparation of all solutions. 2.2 Preparation of TiO 2 colloid and TiO 2 photoanodes The TiO 2 colloid was synthesized by the hydrolysis of titanium butoxide [20] . Briefly, 25 mL titanium butoxide with 8 mL isopropanol was added dropwise to 0.1 M nitric acid solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The slurry was kept in a water bath at 80 \u00b0C, stirred and peptized for 10 h. The resultant colloid was hydrothermally treated at 200 \u00b0C for 12 h. The TiO 2 dry weight concentration of the colloid was adjusted to 6% (w/w) with water. Carbowax (1.8%, w/w) was added as a binder into the resultant colloid. The ITO glass slides were washed with acetone and then Milli-Q water to assure the cleanness. The TiO 2 colloid was dip-coated onto the ITO substrates (15 \u00d7 40 mm), dried in ambient environment and annealed at 450 \u00b0C for 0.5 h. After cooling, the substrates were dip-coated again, dried and annealed at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h. 2.3 Apparatus and methods The PECD was a three-electrode thin layer cell with a quartz window for UV illumination (see Fig. 1 ). The TiO 2 photoanode, a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and a platinum mesh were used as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The flow path and the photoelectrochemical reaction zone were confined by a spacer (see Fig. 1 ). The thickness of the spacer was 0.1 mm, and the diameter of the quartz lens was 5 mm. CS300 Electrochemical Workstation (Potentiostat CV-27 from Bioanalysis System, USA) coupled to a computer (DCNE, Dell Inc.) was used for application of potential bias and recording potential and current signals. Illumination was carried out using UV-LED (NCCU033, Nichia Corporation). The output UV light intensity was measured at 365 nm wavelength using a UV irradiance meter (UV-A Instruments of Beijing Normal University). The HPLC system consisted of a Model LC1120 HPLC pump (GBC, Australia) and a Model 7725i injector (Rheodyne, USA). HPLC mobile phase (i.e. water) was degassed and filtered before use with 0.45 \u03bcm \u00d7 47 mm Nylon 66 membranes (Supelco, USA) and a solvent filtration kit (Synthware). The samples were degassed before injection. The sample was injected into a sample loop (20 \u03bcL) by a 100 \u03bcL Unimetrics syringe (Unimetrics, USA). The sample was filtered prior to injection with a 0.45-\u03bcm Millipore disposable filter (Millipore Corp., USA). The HPLC column utilized in this study was a Develosil 5 \u03bc RP-Aqueous C30 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d. stainless steel column (Phenomenex, USA) with a 10 \u00d7 4.0 mm i.d. guard column. In comparison of the analytical performance, a UV\u2013Vis detector LC 1200 (GBC, Australia) was used. In order to minimize the electric resistance of the thin layer cell, a NaNO 3 solution was used as supporting electrolyte at the thin layer photoelectrochemical reaction zone. In the FIA system, a 2.0 M NaNO 3 solution was used as the carrier and for preparing samples. For HPLC analysis, the solution eluted from the column was mixed with 4.0 M NaNO 3 solution in a reaction coil before reaching the photoelectrochemical reaction zone. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Analytical principle In this study, the photocurrent generated at the TiO 2 photoanode was measured at +0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl by the electrochemical workstation. When the UV-LED was not switched on, in the presence or absence of organic compounds, the electrochemical current was almost zero. This is because the photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds (i.e., Eq. (1) ) and water was not activated. When the UV-LED was switched on, the TiO 2 photoanode was under the constant illumination of 18 mW/cm 2 UV light of 365 nm. A constant photocurrent ( i blank ) of ca. 15 \u03bcA was observed for the blank solution (see Fig. 2 ). i blank is resulted from the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of water. When the sample containing organic compounds was injected and flowed through the thin layer cell, a typical chromatographic peak was observed (see Fig. 2 ). The current (i.e., i sample ) consists of two parts, one is the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of water (i.e., the i blank ), and the other is the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds (i.e., i net ). Because the concentration of water is constant, the i blank can be considered constant. i net is therefore can be calculated by subtracting i blank from i sample , i.e., (2) i net = i sample - i blank The charge ( Q ), generated from the oxidation of the organics, can be obtained by integration of i net with time (see the shaded area in Fig. 2 ), i.e., (3) Q = \u222b i net dt If the injected organic compound is completely mineralized according to Eq. (1) , the theoretical charge ( Q theoretical ) can be calculated using Faraday\u2019s law, i.e., (4) Q theoretical = nFVC where n , F , V , and C are oxidation number, Faraday constant, reactor cell volume and molar concentration of the injected sample, respectively. Because the sample solution flows through the thin layer cell continuously during the determination process, it can be expected that the organic compounds in the solution can be partially oxidized. The oxidation percentage ( \u03b1 ) can be defined by Eq. (5) , where Q is the amount of electrons captured during the detection process, and Q theoretical is the theoretical charge required for the complete oxidation of the injected sample. (5) \u03b1 = Q / Q theoretical The relationship between measured charge Q and analyte concentration C can be represented by Eq. (6) which was obtained by combining Eqs. (4) and (5) . (6) Q = \u03b1 \u00b7 Q theoretical = \u03b1 \u00b7 nFVC = kC During the FIA and HPLC analysis, if the light intensity, applied potential, flow rate and injection volume are well controlled, \u03b1 can be considered as a constant in a certain concentration range. If these conditions are achieved, the Q will be directly proportional to C as indicated in Eq. (6) . 3.2 Optimization of the PECD In the optimization experiments, the PECD was connected with a simple FIA system including a peristaltic pump and injector, which formed a FIA\u2013PECD system. 3.2.1 Effect of potential bias The recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes in semiconductor particles is one of major limiting factors for the photocatalytic oxidation process [21,22] . If the photogenerated electrons are drawn from the semiconductor valence band, the efficiency of oxidation (i.e. reaction with holes) at the semiconductor\u2013electrolyte interface will be improved and the sensitivity of the PECD will be improved as well [23] . The optimization of potential bias can improve the oxidation efficiency and ensure the maximum capture of photoelectron. The latter issue is essential for the detections since the analytical signal ( Q ) depends on the amount of electrons captured [14] . Fig. 3 shows the effect of applied potential bias on the measured charge Q . Q increased with the applied potential and then levelled off when the applied potential was over +0.1 V. Within the applied potential range of \u22120.3 V to +0.1 V, the analytical responses increased because the increased applied potential was beneficial to the separation of photogenerated holes and electrons and the photoelectron removal process was the rate-limiting step in the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process [14,24,25] . When the applied potential was more positive than +0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the photoelectron removal process was no longer the limiting step. Instead, the rate-limiting step in the photocatalytic oxidation process was the interfacial reactions [14] , and the maximum electron capture was obtained, consequently, the amount of the captured electrons was insensitive to the applied potential. Therefore, in order to capture maximum electrons in the detections of different organic compounds while avoiding electrochemical reactions, the applied potential bias of +0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl was selected for the rest experiments. 3.2.2 Effect of light intensity Fig. 4 displays the effect of UV light intensity on the Q values. When the light intensity was less than 18 mW/cm 2 , there appeared to be a linear increase of Q with increased light intensity. This can be explained by the fact that at low light intensity, the increase of light intensity enhanced the production of photo holes and therefore oxidation percentage. In other words, higher ratio of organic compound was oxidized and subsequently led to higher Q value due to the increased light intensity. When the light intensity was over 18 mW/cm 2 , the Q value was relatively saturated. When the light intensity increased and exceeded to a threshold value (in this case 18 mW/cm 2 ), the sufficient supply of photoholes caused the depletion of the organics so much that the mass transport of the organics from the solution to the TiO 2 surface became an limiting factor. Therefore, further increases in light intensity did not produce obvious enhancement in the analytical responses [16] . Furthermore, too high intensity of UV light may produce air bubbles via the water splitting reaction, which will affect the analytical signal seriously. Therefore, the light intensity of 18 mW/cm 2 was selected in the rest experiments. 3.2.3 Effect of flow rate Flow rate plays an important role on the sensitivity of the PECD. The residence time of the sample at the photoelectrochemical zone changes upon the variation of the flow rate [26,27] . Fig. 5 a shows the Q\u2013C relationships obtained under different flow rates. All the Q\u2013C relationships in the tested flow rate range were linear, i.e., the Q values were directly proportional to the glucose concentrations C at a constant flow rate. Fig. 5 b indicates that the oxidation percentage was constant if the flow rate was controlled constant. This validates the analytical principle of the proposed analytical method (Eq. (6) ). Fig. 5 a also shows that the slopes of the Q\u2013C calibration curves increased with the reduced flow rates. In other words, slow flow rates were in favour of high sensitivity. Slower flow rate led to longer contact time for the organics and TiO 2 ; therefore, higher oxidation percentage can be expected (see Fig. 5 b). Fig. 5 b shows that, for the samples with the same glucose concentration, a faster flow rate resulted in a lower oxidation percentage. In order to enhance the sensitivity of the detector, a slower flow rate was therefore preferred in the FIA system. However, too slow flow will lead to the problem of small sample throughout and peak-widening effect. Herein, the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was selected as the optimum flow rate for the experiments in the FIA\u2013PECD system. 3.2.4 Effect of injection volume The dependence of the Q on the sample injection volume is shown in Fig. 6 , which depicts the Q\u2013C relationships for the injection volumes of 14, 64, 80 and 100 \u03bcL. For all the injection volumes, all the Q\u2013C relationships were linear. It can be also seen that the slopes of the Q\u2013C calibration curves in Fig. 6 became larger as the injection volume increased. It means that an augmentation of injection volume resulted in a higher sensitivity. That is because that a larger injection volume under a constant flow rate led to a longer contact between the organic compound and the TiO 2 surface, and hence a larger amount of organics was oxidized, then a higher Q was obtained. All these observation validates the detection principle regarding the sample volume (i.e., Eq. (6) ). It is therefore expected that the increase of the injection volume can boost the sensitivity of the PECD. However, a large injection volume may exceed the linear range of PECD and may be also out of the separation capacity of the HPLC column, especially when the sample contains high concentration of organics. If the injection amount of organic is too large for the PECD, the oxidation percentage ( \u03b1 ) will decrease and consequently the Eq. (6) is no longer valid. In other words, the obtained Q will not be proportional to C . In view of the aforementioned factors of the injection volume, relatively small injection volumes of 14 and 20 \u03bcL was selected for the experiments in the FIA\u2013PECD and HPLC\u2013PECD systems, respectively. 3.3 The overall performance of the FIA\u2013PECD In order to demonstrate the PECD can be used to detect various types of organic compounds universally, the performance of the PECD was evaluated by testing different classes of organic compounds in the FIA system under the above optimized experimental conditions. The tested organic compounds included sugars, amino acids, straight chain carboxylic acids, aliphatic alcohol, and aromatic carboxylic acid (see Fig. 7 ). Fig. 7 shows that the linear relationships were obtained between the measured charge Q and the molar concentration C for all the tested organic compounds. This validates the Eq. (6) where the Q is directly proportional to the molar concentration for different organic compounds, which suggests that this PECD is capable of being a universal detector for a wide spectrum of organic compounds. Under the optimized conditions, glucose and sucrose were used as the representative organic compounds to evaluate the analytical performance of the PECD because they are not commonly detected by the most often-used HPLC detector (i.e. UV\u2013Vis detector). Fig. 8 displays the typical well-defined and reproducible analytical signals for the injections of the samples containing 100, 300 and 500 \u03bcM glucose. The relative standard deviations (RSD%) of six replicate injections of 100 \u03bcM glucose and sucrose were 3.20% and 3.23%, respectively. The linear ranges for determination of glucose and sucrose were 25\u2013600 \u03bcM and 25\u2013500 \u03bcM, respectively, with the detection limit of 10 \u03bcM for both sugars. 3.4 Determination of sugars with the HPLC\u2013PECD system The PECD was introduced for the determination of sugars to demonstrate its feasibility and compatibility with HPLC system. According to the results from the FIA\u2013PECD system makes the PECD to be the detector for HPLC possible, i.e., HPLC\u2013PECD. Most of the experimental conditions from the FIA\u2013PECD system can be employed directly to the HPLC\u2013PECD system, e.g., the applied potential bias and the light intensity. Some of the experimental conditions, such as flow rate need to be optimized specially for HPLC system. In particular, a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min for the 4.0 M NaNO 3 supporting electrolyte used in the HPLC\u2013PECD was faster than that of 0.3 mL/min in the FIA\u2013PECD system. It was observed that the photocurrent was lower and a lot noisier at a slow flow rate (e.g. 0.3 mL/min) than that at a faster flow rate (e.g. 1.1 mL/min) in the HPLC\u2013PECD system. This might be due to the advantages brought by the fast flow rate. The faster flow rate is beneficial for better mixing effect for the HPLC eluted solution and 4 M NaNO 3 supporting electrolyte in the mixing coil. Also the fast flow rate provides higher pressure within the PECD and therefore better contact for the solution and the TiO 2 surface. Consequently, more stable and higher i blank was obtained. In order to obtain better quality of the analytical signals, the flow rate of 1.1 mL/min was selected for the HPLC\u2013PECD system. Fig. 9 displays the typical response for sugars obtained from the HPLC\u2013PECD system. According to the retention time analysis of the single pure compound, the retention time of glucose was shorter than that of sucrose under the same experimental conditions. Thus, for the analysis of the mixture sample in Fig. 9 , the first peak was glucose while the second peak belonged to sucrose. Fig. 10 gives the calibration curves for glucose and sucrose using the PECD. It can be seen that the linear relationships between Q and C were obtained in the range of 7.5\u2013200 mM for both glucose and sucrose. In addition, the detection limit for both glucose and sucrose was 1 mM, and the RSD% of six replicate injections of 40 mM glucose was 4.56%. Under the same HPLC experimental conditions, UV\u2013Vis detector (at 190 nm) [28,29] was used to detect the sugar mixture samples for comparison. The linear ranges for glucose and sucrose at UV\u2013Vis detector were 7.5\u201360 mM and 7.5\u201340 mM for glucose and sucrose, respectively. This suggests that PECD had wider linear range than the UV\u2013Vis detector. Moreover, the detection limits for both glucose and sucrose for the UV\u2013Vis detector were 3 mM which were less sensitive than that of the PECD. 4 Conclusion A low cost and efficient PECD for FIA and HPLC was developed. The analytical principle was validated by quantitative determination of a variety of organic compounds including sugars, amino acids, straight chain carboxylic acids, aliphatic alcohol, and aromatic carboxylic acid using FIA. The PECD was successfully coupled with the HPLC for determining sugars. Compared with the UV\u2013Vis detection method, PECD achieved a higher sensitivity and larger linear range for determination of glucose and sucrose. With the further optimization of the cell design and improvement of the TiO 2 photoanode, the performance of the PECD can be improved and it can be expected that the PECD can be commercially available in the near future.

TiO2 nanoparticles can be anchored on the GO sheets via the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups such as epoxy, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups on the GO sheets. Using the TiO2 photocatalyst, the GO was photocatalytically reduced under UV illumination, leading to the production of TiO2-reduced graphene oxide (TiO2-RGO) nanocomposite. The as-prepared TiO2, TiO2-GO, and TiO2-RGO nanocomposite were used to fabricate lithium ion batteries (LIBs) as the active anode materials and their corresponding lithium ion insertion/extraction performance was evaluated. The resultant LIBs of the TiO2-RGO nanocomposite possesses more stable cyclic performance, larger reversible capacity, and better rate capability, compared with that of the pure TiO2 and TiO2-GO samples. The electrochemical and materials characterization suggest that the graphene network provides efficient pathways for electron transfer, and the TiO2 nanoparticles prevent the restacking of the graphene nanosheets, resulting in the improvement in both electric conductivity and specific capacity, respectively. This work suggests that the TiO2 based photocatalytic method could be a simple, low-cost, and efficient approach for large-scale production of anode materials for lithium ion batteries.",

The results showed that the periphyton mainly consisted of bacteria and diatoms. The application of periphyton bioreactor decreased the levels of exchange phosphorus (Exch-P) in sediments from 1.69 to 0.49 mg g(-1) and total phosphorus (TP) from 0.75 to 0.30 mg L(-1). The significant reduction of the total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) content was not only beneficial for the decrease of the cyanobacterial growth, but also stimulates the periphyton to produce natural cyanobacterial inhibitors such as gallic acid and ethyl-2-methylacetoacetate. These synergistic effects led to the growth inhabitation of M. aeruginosa when the initial concentrations of M. aeruginosa were less than 119.3 microg L(-1). This study provides an environmentally-friendly and publically acceptable method of controlling bacterial blooms when compared to traditional addition of chemicals.",

After calcination at 450 \u00b0C for 2 h, the rutile TiO2 microspheres with a high surface area of 132 m2/g have been utilized as a light harvesting enhancement material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The resultant DSSCs exhibit an overall light conversion efficiency of 8.41% for TiO2 photoanodes made of rutile TiO2 microspheres and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (mass ratio of 1:1), significantly higher than that of pure anatase TiO2 nanoparticle photoanodes of similar thickness (6. 74%). Such a significant improvement in performance can be attributed to the enhanced light harvesting capability and synergetic electron transfer effect. This is because the photoanodes made of rutile TiO2 microsphere possess high refractive index which improves the light utilisation efficiency, suitable microsphere core sizes (450-800 nm) to effectively scatter visible light, high surface area for dye loading, and synergetic electron transfer effects between nanoparticulate anatase and nano-acicular rutile single crystals phases giving high electron collection efficiency. \u00a9 2011 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

The resultant electrodes were characterised using materials characterisation methods (such as scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer) as well as photoelectrochemical means. The preliminary results indicate that the nanostructure of the original TiO 2 particles is well maintained in the printing process, and the thickness and uniformity of the TiO 2 thin film can be well controlled by the simple printing technique. Combined with photoelectrochemical means, the inkjet-printed TiO 2 photoanode is capable of oxidising organic compounds in aqueous solution, including weak organic adsorbates (e.g., glucose, phenol) and strong organic adsorbates (e.g., potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP), glutaric acid, malonic acid) indiscriminately in bulk cell. This characteristic is utilized to determine chemical oxygen demand (COD) in aqueous samples. A linear range of 0\u2013120 mg/L of O 2 and a detection limit of 1 mg/L of O 2 were achieved. The photoelectrochemical activity of the printed electrodes was found to be highly reproducible.

The method is capable of inactivating 99.90% and 100% of 9 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL E. coli within 0.40 s and 1.57 s, respectively.

The decomposition experimental results obtained from 600-s PEC-Br-treated samples demonstrated that over 90% of E. coli body mass was decomposed and 42% biological carbon contents in the sample was completely mineralized and converted into CO2. The mechanistic pathways of disinfection/decomposition by photocatalysis (PC), photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), and photoelectrocatalysis in presence of Br- (PEC-Br) were also illustrated based on experimental evidence. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "This work reports a facile approach to fabricate a perpendicularly aligned and highly ordered TiO(2) nanorod/nanotube (NR/NT) adjacent film by directly anodizing a modified titanium foil. The titanium foil substrate was modified with a layer of crystalline TiO(2) film via a hydrothermal process in 0.05 M (NH(4))(2)S(2)O(8). The resultant NR/NT architecture consists of a highly ordered nanorod top layer that directly adjoins to a highly ordered nanotube array bottom layer. The thickness of the top nanorod layer was approximately 90 nm with average nanorod diameter of 22 nm after 20 min of anodization. The thickness of the bottom nanotube array layer was found to be ca. 250 nm after 20 min of anodization, having an average outer and inner tubular diameters of 120 and 80 nm, respectively. A broad implication of the method is that a simple modification to the substrate surface can lead to new forms of nanostructures. For as-anodized NR/NT samples, XRD analysis reveals that the nanorods are of anatase TiO(2) crystalline form while the nanotubes are amorphous. Anatase TiO(2) crystalline form of NR/NT film with high crystallinity can be obtained by thermally treating the as-anodized sample at 450 degrees C for 2 h in air. The resultant NR/NT film was used as a photoanode for photoactivity evaluation. Comparing with a nanotube array photoanode prepared by direct anodization of unmodified titanium foil, the NR/NT photoanode exhibits a unique feature of selective photocatalytic oxidation toward organics, which makes it very attractive to photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, sensing, and other applications.",

        "abstract": "A simple photoelectrochemical method is developed to measure the intrinsic electron transport resistance (R(0)) of TiO(2) photoanodes. R(0) is considered as the sum of electron transport resistance at the TiO(2)/FTO interface and among TiO(2) nanoparticulates during electron transport process, which is independent of the manner of electron injection, its physical and chemical environments. Because TiO(2) photoanodes are the common electron transport pathways for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) process and the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process, R(0) can be also considered as a quantitative measure of the electron transport resistance of the photoanodes in the DSSC process. The proposed method will provide a simple and rapid alternative to quantitatively evaluate the quality of the TiO(2) photoanodes for DSSCs using R(0) values. A series of TiO(2)/FTO photoanodes with different electron transport resistance were fabricated using conventional screen-printing technique, surface modifications using titanium organic sol and TiCl(4) aqueous solution. R(0) values of the photoanodes were characterized and subsequently used to correlate with the important performance parameters of the corresponding DSSCs. The preliminary results suggest that these surface modifications do not significantly affect the surface area, film thickness, dye loading and optical properties of the TiO(2) film, but significantly decrease the R(0) values. Furthermore, the DSSCs photoanodes with lower R(0) values due to the organic sol or TiCl(4) modification bestow better photovoltaic performance than the corresponding non-modified photoanodes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the performance improvements were mainly attributed to the decrease of the R(0) values, which validates the proposed electrochemical evaluation method.",

The effects of PEG molecular weight and thermal treatment temperature on the resultant structure and photoactivity were investigated. Morphological, structural and phase compositional properties of the resultant photocatalysts were systematically characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. The mesoporous structure with diameters between 13.3 and 17.0 nm and mean porous sizes that ranged from 9.6 to 13.3 nm were obtained when the molecular weight of PEG were varied from 200 to 20,000. The mesoporous diameters were changed significantly from 9.8 to 18.4 nm with mean porous sizes slightly increasing from 8.0 to 10.0 nm when the calcination temperature was varied from 350 to 550 \u00b0C. The activities of the resultant TiO 2 photocatalysts were evaluated using 2,4,6-tribrominated phenol as a testing compound that represents a class of toxic brominated flame retardants.

A hydrothermal treatment process was introduced to better control the resultant mesoporous structures. Keywords Mesoporous TiO 2 Texture control PEG template Photocatalytic activity Tribromophenol 1 Introduction Synthesis of mesoporous metal oxide functional materials, especially mesoporous titanium dioxide, has been a hot topic of interest to researchers in many different fields, due to enormous application potentials of such materials as membranes, in catalysis and solar energy conversion and as chemical sensors [1\u20138] . This class of materials possesses well-defined porous sizes, porosity and large specific surface areas [9,10] . When they are used as catalysts for photocatalytic degradation of organics, these desirable properties are anticipated to improve the photocatalytic activity because the performances of such photocatalysts rely on these attributes [3,4,7,9,10] . During the past two decades, many synthetic methods have been proposed to obtain mesoporous titanium dioxide (M-TiO 2 ), including sol\u2013gel method, template method, hydrothermal method, solvothermal method, ultrasound-induced method, ion liquid method, and evaporation-induced self-assembly method [11\u201318] . Among these methods, the sol\u2013gel method is probably the simplest method, but formation of aggregated nanoparticles during the precipitation and post-calcination processes often lead to poorly defined mesoporous structures [19] . In order to obtain well-defined mesoporous structures and better control on porous size and porosity of the resultant material, various structural directing reagents have been introduced to sol\u2013gel processes. These structural directing reagents are capable of forming long-ranged 3D nanosize networks, which can be used as structural templates to define a mesoporous structure [6,20\u201323] . To date, well-defined M-TiO 2 with mean pore sizes below 10 nm have been successfully synthesized by employing different structural directing reagents [6,14,19,21,24] . Nevertheless, the synthesis of large-pores M-TiO 2 remains as a challenge due to the rapid hydrolysis of titanium precursors that is difficult to control. In practice, strong acids (i.e. HCl and HNO 3 ) and complex reagents (i.e. acetylacetone, oxalate, citrate) are commonly employed to reduce the rapidity of the hydrolysis process [25,26] . When a strong acid is employed, the pH of the reaction solution changes rapidly with time, which may lead to formation of less porous and larger particle-sized TiO 2 [27] . Recently, a weak acid such as acetic acid (HAc) has been used to replace strong acids for better control of the hydrolysis process of titanium sources due to the chelating effect of acetic anions and formation of pH buffer [14,27] . Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been frequently used as a structure-directing reagent to obtain nanoporous SiO 2 [9,24,28] , aluminosilicate [29,30] and other composite materials [17] . However, only a limited number of investigations has been targeted to produce M-TiO 2 by employing PEG as the structural directing reagent [6,10,31,32] . In this work, we report a new synthesis procedure that can be used to produce large pore-sized M-TiO 2 . The new procedure employs PEG and acetic acid as the structural directing reagent and hydrolytic retardants, respectively. The new procedure also involves a post hydrothermal treatment process to improve the quality of the resultant M-TiO 2 . The effect of synthesis conditions on the structural characteristics of the resultant M-TiO 2 was investigated. The photocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) was conducted to demonstrate the photocatalytic performance of the resultant M-TiO 2 . TBP represents a widely used brominated flame retardant materials that has been widely used as a flame retardant to reduce fire risk for production of electronic devices, epoxy, polyurethane, plastics, paper, textiles and as a synthetic intermediate for production of commercial brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and fire extinguishing media [33] . TBP is also used for production of pesticides and wood preservatives. It has been reported that toxic intermediates, such as brominated benzenes and brominated diphenyl esters, can be formed during the biodegradation of TBP [34] . Moreover, TBP can also be frequently detected in food [35] , solids and sawdust [36] as well as water bodies [37] . The material is believed to be toxic to aquatic organisms and may have long-term adverse impacts on the aquatic environment, as well as posing possible risks to the human foetus. Therefore, development of an effective mean to remove TBP from the contaminated matrix is of practical importance for maintaining a healthy environment. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of M-TiO 2 M-TiO 2 was prepared using the hydrothermal-assistant sol\u2013gel method. In a typical synthesis procedure, 5 g of titanium butoxide ( M = 340.36, 98%, Ti(OC 4 H 9 ) 4 ) was added drop-by-drop to 30 mL of HAc (A.R.) aqueous solution (20%, v/v) under vigorous stirring. The mixed solution was sealed and stirring was continued for 4 h to obtain solution A. In a separate beaker, 3 g of PEG (A.R.) with the molecular weight of 600 (designated as PEG600) was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol (A.R.) under vigorous stirring to obtain solution B. Solution B was then added drop-by-drop to solution A. The final mixed solution was sealed and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The resultant solution was then transferred into a Teflon sealed container for hydrothermal treatment under a constant temperature of 120 \u00b0C for 48 h. The precipitations were then collected and dried overnight in air at 80 \u00b0C. The as-prepared sample was then subjected to a thermal treatment process at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. To investigate the effect of hydrothermal treatment, we replaced the 48 h hydrothermal treatment process by a 48 h room temperature treatment process to examine the effect of calcination temperature. The as-prepared samples were calcined at 350, 450, 550 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the effect of the molecular weight of PEG, we replaced the PEG600 by PEG200, PEG1000, PEG2000 and PEG20000, respectively. Deionized and doubly distilled water was used throughout the experiment. 2.2 Characterization of M-TiO 2 The crystal phase composition and crystallinity of the obtained M-TiO 2 was determined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2200 VPC) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0 . 15418 nm) at an accelerating voltage of 40 kV, an emission current of 30 mA, and a scanning speed of 5\u00b0/min. The morphology was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010 HR) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. 2.3 Photocatalysis Photocatalysis experiments were performed in aqueous solutions containing TBP (A.R.) with an initial concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. The photocatalysis reactor consists of a 160 mL Pyrex glass chamber with a jacket outside and a 125 W high pressure Hg lamp in parallel to the Pyrex glass chamber. In all the experiments, the reaction temperature was kept at 27 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C by a continuous circulation of water in the jacket around the reactor. Reaction suspensions were prepared by adding 0.225 g of M-TiO 2 photocatalyst powder into 150 mL TBP aqueous solution under vigorous stirring. Prior to irradiation, all reaction suspensions were stirred in the dark for 30 min to establish an adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. A 3 mL sample solution was taken from the reactor at given time intervals, and filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm millipore filter for analysis. The concentrations of TBP in the suspensions were monitored by an Agilent 1200 high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector ( \u03bb = 286 nm). After 50 \u03bcL samples were injected, the substances were separated by an Agilent C18 reverse-phase column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm). The mobile phase consisted of 45 vol.% water and 55 vol.% acetonitrile pumped at 1 mL/min, and the column was thermostated at 35 \u00b0C. The chromatographic areas of experimental samples were converted to the concentration values using calibration curves based on the standard compounds. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphological and structural characteristics of M-TiO 2 3.1.1 Effect of hydrothermal treatment The wide angle XRD patterns of M-TiO 2 samples prepared with or without hydrothermal treatment are shown in Fig. 1 . The XRD patterns obtained from samples with or without hydrothermal treatment exhibits similar characteristics, which can be indexed to 25.3 (1 0 1), 37.2 (0 0 4), 48.9 (2 0 0), 54.0 (1 0 5), 55.3 (2 1 1), 62.4 (2 0 4) and 68.7 (1 1 2), suggesting that anatase is the only crystalline phase in the sample [5] . The mean crystal sizes of the resultant M-TiO 2 were calculated from the broadening of the (1 0 1) XRD peaks of anatase phase according to the Scherrer formula [38] . The mean crystal sizes of 14.7 and 16.4 nm were obtained from samples with and without hydrothermal treatment, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and the Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution profiles (insert) of samples with and without hydrothermal treatment. All the profiles reveal a small hysteresis loop, implying the presence of mesopores at high relative pressure range between 0.4 and 0.8 (Type IV) [39] . Moreover, the N 2 adsorption quantity for the sample prepared with hydrothermal treatment is much higher than that of the sample without hydrothermal treatment, indicating the abundance of mesopores in a hydrothermally treated sample. The isotherm of hydrothermally treated sample exhibits a high Type IV adsorption/desorption shape with an H1 hysteresis loop, which implies that the synthesized M-TiO 2 samples consist of agglomerates or compacts of approximately uniform spheres in fairly regular array with a narrow range of pore size distribution [40,41] . However, for samples without hydrothermal treatment, the obtained isotherms display Type IV shape with a H2 hysteresis loop, suggesting the existence of ink-bottle pores with narrow necks and wide bodies [41] . The pore-size distribution profiles are given in the insert of Fig. 2 . The maximum adsorption peaks valued at 11.1 and 6.4 nm were observed for samples with and without hydrothermal treatment, respectively. This suggests that the hydrothermal treatment can suppress the aggregation of the crystalline particles and can enlarge the pore size. The BET surface areas and other parameters were also investigated (see Table 1 ). Without hydrothermal treatment, the BET surface area of 50 m 2 /g and the mean pore size of 6.3 nm were obtained. The BET surface areas and the mean pore size were increased to 72 m 2 /g and 9.6 nm, respectively, when the sample was subjected to the hydrothermal treatment process. In addition, the microporous volumes observed for samples with and without hydrothermal treatment were 0.029 and 0.020 cm 3 /g, respectively, but the total pore volumes observed for the hydrothermally treated sample (0.24 cm 3 /g) was 200% greater than that observed for a sample without hydrothermal treatment (0.11 cm 3 /g). This implies that the mesoporous structure of hydrothermally treated sample contains larger numbers of mesopores in comparison to the untreated sample. 3.1.2 Effect of PEG molecular weight The effect of PEG molecular weight on the mean crystalline size of the hydrothermally treated sample was investigated. These hydrothermally treated samples were calcinated at 450 \u00b0C for 4 h. It was found that the mean crystalline sizes decreased from 17.0 to 13.3 nm when the molecular weight increased from 200 to 20,000 (see Table 2 ). This is in agreement with the work published by Devi et al. [5] . Fig. 3 shows the N 2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of hydrothermally treated M-TiO 2 samples prepared with different PEG molecular weights. All isotherms reveal Type IV curve characteristics with a small H1 hysteresis loop, indicating ordered cylindrical pores [40] . It was found that the amount of adsorbed N 2 increased significantly at certain molecular weight ranges. The lowest amount of adsorbed N 2 was observed with samples prepared with PEG molecular weights that ranged from 200 to 600. A sharp increase in the amount of adsorbed N 2 was recorded with samples prepared with PEG molecular weights that ranged from 1000 to 2000. When the molecular weight was increased to 20,000, a further increase in the amount of adsorbed N 2 was obtained. The effect of PEG molecular weight on the pore size distribution was also investigated (see the insert in Fig. 3 ). It was found that an increase in the PEG molecular weight leads to a stepwise increase in the pore size range and in the peak of the pore size distribution. For the PEG molecular weights of 200 and 600, the observed pore size distribution was ranged from 5.0 to 14.5 nm with a maximum adsorption peak at 11.0 nm. For the PEG molecular weights of 1000 and 2000, the observed pore size distribution ranged from 5.0 to 18.0 nm with a peak at 13.0 nm. A much broader pore size distribution was observed with the molecular weight of 20,000, which ranged from 5.0 to 22.5 nm with a peak at 15.0 nm. Interestingly, these stepwise increase trends caused by the PEG molecular size increase was also observed for the mean pore size and for the total volume (see Table 2 ). 3.1.3 Effect of calcination temperatures The wide angle XRD patterns of hydrothermally treated M-TiO 2 calcinated at different temperatures were recorded (see Fig. 4 ). The anatase was found to be the only crystalline phase present in all samples, regardless of the treatment temperature. As expected, an increase in the treatment temperature results in an increase in the crystallinity. The mean crystalline sizes calculated from the XRD patterns using the Scherrer formula [38] were found to be increased from 9.8 to 36 nm when the treatment temperature was increased from 350 to 650 \u00b0C (see Table 3 ). The average particle sizes obtained from the present work are much larger than those in previously published data [6,21,24] . Fig. 5 shows the N 2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution profiles of hydrothermally treated M-TiO 2 calcinated at different temperatures. The characteristics of the recorded isotherms for all samples display a Type IV curve. A H1 hysteresis loop was observed for samples calcined at relatively low temperatures of 350, 450 or 550 \u00b0C. For the sample calcined at 650 \u00b0C, a H3 hysteresis loop from 0.6 to 0.99 relative pressure ( P / P 0 ) was observed, indicating that aggregates of plate-like structures exist [41] . Fig. 5 also reveals that the amount of adsorbed N 2 decreased rapidly with increased calcination temperature. The isotherm obtained from the sample calcined at 650 \u00b0C indicates the amount of adsorbed N 2 was neglectable, which implies the completely collapsed mesoporous structure. The insert of Fig. 5 shows the pore size distribution profiles. It was found that, for the 350 \u00b0C-calcinated sample, the pore size distribution was peaked around at 9.1 nm with a substantial percentage of pores sized below 5.0 nm. For the 450 \u00b0C-calcinated sample, the distribution peak was shifted to around 11.1 nm with a neglectable percentage of pores sized below 5.0 nm. This could be due to the mesoporous structure consolidation as a result of improved crystallinity at higher calcination temperature. The pore size distribution profile obtained from the sample calcinated at 550 \u00b0C shows a peak around at 10.7 nm, due to the formation of larger pores. An almost flatted pore size distribution profile was observed for the sample calcinated at 650 \u00b0C, which confirms the completely collapsed mesoporous structure. The effect of the sample calcination temperature on the BET surface areas and other properties were also investigated (see Table 3 ). It was found that a sample with low calcination temperature (i.e. 350 \u00b0C) possesses high BET surface areas (i.e. 142 m 2 /g). The observed BET surface area was rapidly reduced to 49 m 2 /g when the calcination temperature was increased to 550 \u00b0C. The BET surface area of 7 m 2 /g was measured from the sample calcinated at 650 \u00b0C, which again confirms the complete collapsed mesoporous structure. The data shown in Table 3 also reveal that an increase in the calcination temperature from 350 to 650 \u00b0C leads to an increase in the mean pore sizes from 8.0 to 15.8 nm, and a decrease in both the microporous volume and the total volume. Though the largest mean pore size of 15.6 nm was observed from the sample calcinated at 650 \u00b0C, the neglectable microporous volume of 0.003 cm 3 /g and the total volume of 0.05 cm 3 /g suggest that the resultant material is nonporous, due to the collapsed mesoporous structure. Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of samples calcined at 450 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. The data show that, for the sample calcined at 450 \u00b0C, the obtained M-TiO 2 was formed by primary particles sized between 10 and 20 nm. Under such a calcination temperature, no secondary particle formation was observed (see Fig. 6 a). For the sample calcined at 650 \u00b0C (see Fig. 6 b), the primary particles can no longer be discerned. Under such conditions, the edges of primary particles in the secondary particles blurred to such an extent that they could not be easily recognized, due to a high degree of aggregation between primary particles. The formation of large size secondary particles and highly compacted packing of these secondary particles destroy the mesoporous structure, as evidenced by the above experimental data. It should be mentioned that the images obtained from all samples before calcination (results are not shown) indicate that no aggregation occurred during the hydrolysis process and post hydrothermal treatment process. This may be due to the benefits of replacing strong acid with diluted acetic acid during the hydrolysis process. It is well known that the titanium precursor rapidly hydrolyzing in strong acid media often leads to the aggregation and formation of large size particles because of uncontrollable hydrolysis causes by the rapid pH change [27] . However, a hydrolysis media containing a weak acid such as acetic acid allows a better control of hydrolysis process [27] . In this process, acetic acid serves not just as a hydrolytic retardant but also as chelating and pH buffering agent, enabling a slower and uniform hydrolysis process. 3.2 Photocatalytic degradation of TBP Fig. 7 demonstrates the photolysis and photocatalytic degradation profiles of synthesized M-TiO 2 with or without hydrothermal treatment. Only less than 30% TBP can be decomposed in the photolytic process. Seen from the figure, M-TiO 2 prepared with hydrothermal treatment possesses exhibits significantly higher photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of TBP than that of without hydrothermal treatment. After 60 min photocatalysis, a degradation efficiency of ca. 92.3% was acquired from hydrothermally treated M-TiO 2 photocatalyst while only 85.1% was obtained from M-TiO 2 prepared without hydrothermal treatment. This indicates that the hydrothermal treatment can improve not only the mesoporous structure and particles assembly, but also the photocatalytic degradation activity. The improved photocatalytic activity of M-TiO 2 synthesized with hydrothermal treatment may be attributed to the improved crystal phase composition/crystallinity, enhanced BET surface areas, high total volume and well-defined mesoporous structure [25] . The adsorption performances and the photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO 2 nanoparticles prepared with different molecular weight PEGs as structure-directing reagents was also compared, and the removal efficiencies of TBP are displayed in Fig. 8 . The figure shows that both the adsorption and the degradation efficiencies of TBP increased with PEG molecular weight. The adsorption efficiencies increased from 5.32% to 6.26%, while the degradation efficiencies increased from 89.48% to 95.87% when PEG molecular weight was increased from 200 to 20,000. That is, the larger the PEG molecule, the higher of adsorption efficiencies of TBP and photocatalytic activity. The increase in the adsorptivity and photocatalytic efficiencies may be attributed to the decreased crystalline size of synthesized M-TiO 2 and the increased mesoporous parameters, such as the mean porous size, BET surface area and the total porous volume (see Table 2 ). The variations of the mesoporous structure parameter and the photocatalytic activity of synthesized M-TiO 2 may reflect some change in configuration of ethylene chain in the PEG matrix in accordance with the molecular weight of PEG [5] . When the molecular weight exceeds 400, the PEG chain may be twisted and the PEG segments could form crown-ether-type complexes with inorganic ions through weak coordination interactions [3,17] . During the aging process, PEG molecules lose their bonding water, producing free PEG molecules available to form tightly \u201cparticles-PEG\u201d complexes [3] . Thus, a larger PEG molecule would result in a smaller crystalline size and larger mean porous size, BET areas and total volume, which, in turn, would lead to better adsorptivity and degradation efficiencies. Fig. 9 shows the degradation profiles of TBP obtained from M-TiO 2 prepared at different thermal treatment temperatures. It was found that the TBP degradation efficiency increased as the sample calcination temperature increased from 350 to 550 \u00b0C and then sharply decreased when the sample calcination temperature further increased to 650 \u00b0C. The insert of Fig. 9 shows the rate constants of M-TiO 2 prepared at different thermal treatment temperatures. Pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics was observed, which is similar to the kinetics obtained from other mesoporous TiO 2 catalysis systems [42] . The TBP degradation rate constant was found to be rapidly increased from 0.010 to 0.018 min \u22121 when the thermal treatment temperature was increased from at 350 to 550 \u00b0C. A sharp decrease in the rate constant to 0.004 min \u22121 was observed from the sample thermally treated at 650 \u00b0C, indicating a sharp decrease in the photoactivity. As shown in Table 3 , when the thermal treatment temperature increased from 350 to 550 \u00b0C, the resultant M-TiO 2 increased its crystalline size (representing the crystallinity) from 9.8 to 18.4 nm, while the BET areas decreased from 142 to 49 m 2 /g. It is obvious that the increased crystallinity was the decisive factor for the increased photocatalytic degradation efficiency [43] . However, the low activity of 350 \u00b0C-calcined photocatalyst can be partly a result of the inhibiting effect of significant amounts of carbonaceous residues. On the contrary, the sharp decrease in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency obtained from the sample thermally treated under 650 \u00b0C was due to the completely collapsed mesoporous structure, as the data in Table 3 indicated.

The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated using the newly developed PeCOD system with a wide range of possible scenarios. It was found that the chloride interference was insignificant when a sample meets the two critical criteria, i.e., chloride concentration <or=26.6 ppm and the concentration ratio of chloride to organics <or=5 : 1 (ppm Cl(-)/ppm COD). The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of such a sample can be directly determined by the direct PeCOD method. When the chloride content in a sample exceeds 26.6 ppm, an appropriate sample dilution could effectively reduce the chloride interference to less than 5%, if the diluted sample meets the critical criteria. An organic addition method was proposed to deal with scenarios for samples containing high chloride and low organic concentrations where the critical criteria cannot be met by simple dilution. Such an approach greatly extends the applicability of the proposed method, covering a wide range of possible real-world scenarios without the need to use expensive (i.e. AgNO(3)) and toxic (i.e. HgSO(4)) masking reagents.",

        "abstract": "The hydrothermal formation of branched titanate nanotubes that grow a 3D nanotubular network directly onto a titanium substrate is reported. The resultant 3D nanotubular network exhibits a unique all-dimensional uniform porous structure. The inner and outer tubular diameters of branched titanate nanotubes were found, to be approximately 6 and 12 nm, respectively. For the majority of the nanotubes, the wall is formed from three layers of titanate with an approximate 7.7 A interlayer space. In terms of individual nanotubes, these characteristics are quantitatively similar to those of previously reported nonbranched nanotubes. However, in terms of how nanotubes are arranged in the film, the all-dimensional uniform nanotubular network structure obtained here is distinctively different from those of previously reported structures, The 3D nanotubular network structure was formed by the jointing of branched nanotubes. In contrast, the previously reported, nanotubes tend to grow vertically on the substrate, and the resultant tubular films are formed by interwoven nonbranched nanotubes. The branched titanate nanotubes can be readily formed, on titanium substrates but not in solution suspension forms. A. continuous seed formation-oriented crystal growth mechanism was proposed for the branched titanate nanotubular network formation, Such a network structure could be useful for applications such as photocatalysis, membrane separation, field emission, and photovoltaic devices \u00a9 2009 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A series of SiO 2 and TiO 2 co-pillared montmorillonite photocatalysts with excellent adsorption capacity and high photocatalytic activity were synthesized via a sol\u2013gel method by pillaring both SiO 2 and TiO 2 mixed sol into sodium montmorillonite. Various material characterization techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine the pillared montmorillonites. 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, a typical hydrophobic organic pollutant, was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity of the prepared co-pillared montmorillonites. The experimental results showed that large SiO 2 content in the pillared montmorillonite was in favor of large adsorption capacity, while large TiO 2 content in the co-pillared montmorillonite was beneficial for the high photocatalytic activity, and the highest photocatalytic activity was obtained for the prepared co-pillared montmorillonite with a SiO 2 /TiO 2 molar ratio of 1:2. Additionally, nine intermediates including 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2-chloro-1,5-diphenol, 1,3,7-trichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,6-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, hexadiene diacid, butyl alkyd, oxalic acid, phloroglucinol and diphenol were detected, and a photocatalytic degradation mechanism of TCP was tentatively proposed.",

        "abstract": "Concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were measured in water, sediments, Ceratophyllum (hornwort), and Bellamya sp. (edible snail) from residential, mixed (industrial and commercial), and agricultural areas with rural rivers in the Taihu Lake region, China. Zn concentrations were the highest, whereas Cd concentrations were the lowest among the six metals in water, sediments, and aquatic organisms. Cd was mainly present in the acid-soluble fraction, Cr in the residual fraction, and Pb in the reducible fraction of sediments. Heavy metal concentrations in water, sediments, and aquatic organisms in the three areas followed the order of the mixed area\u2009&amp;gt;\u2009residential area\u2009&amp;gt;\u2009agricultural area. Heavy metal concentrations in aquatic organisms were not only related to total metal concentrations in water and sediments but also to metal speciation concentrations in sediments. In addition, the bio-concentration factor (BCF) values of Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn for Bellamya sp. were higher than those for Ceratophyllum, whereas the BCF values of Cd and Ni for Bellamya sp. were lower than those for Ceratophyllum. An ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in sediments showed that Cd posed the highest ecological risk to the environment. A health risk assessment showed that consuming Bellamya sp. from the mixed area could cause a potential health risk.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotube (CNT) and TiO2 nanofibre composite films are prepared and used as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) without the use of binders and conventional copper current collector. The preliminary experimental results from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy suggest that the TiO2 nanofibres were well-dispersed and interwoven by the CNTs, forming freestanding, bendable and light weighted composite. In comparison with TiO2 nanofibre based LIBs, the CNTs could significantly improve the battery performance due to their high conductivity property and 3D network morphology. In both 1-3 V and 0.01-3 V testing voltage ranges, the as-prepared composites show excellent reversible capacity and capacity retention. The superior lithium storage capacity of the CNT/TiO2 composite was mainly attributed to dual functions of the CNTs - the CNTs not only provide conductive networks to assist the electron transfer but also facilitate lithium ion diffusion between the electrolyte and the TiO2 active materials by preventing agglomeration of TiO 2 nanofibres. This work demonstrates that the CNT-TiO2 composite film could be one type of potential electrode material for large-scale LIB applications. Crown Copyright \u00a9 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to address these issues, in this work, a simple and up-scalable wet-mechanochemical (wet-ball milling) route has been developed for fabrication of amorphous porous TiO 2 @nitrogen doped graphene (TiO 2 @N-G) nanocomposites. The amorphous phase, unique porous structure of TiO 2  and the surface defects from nitrogen doping to graphene planes have incurred surface controlled reactions, contributing pseudocapacitance to the total capacity of the battery. It plays a dominant role in producing outstanding high rate electrochemical performance, e.g., 182.7\u00a0mAh/g (at 3.36\u00a0A/g) after 100 cycles. The design and synthesis of electrode materials with enhanced conductivity and surface pseudocapacitance can be a promising way for high rate LIBs.",

The microstructure and morphologies are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and high resolution transmission electron microscope. The results indicate that graphene nanosheets with high specific surface area (358.3 m2 g-1) and increased interlayer distance (0.385 nm) are successfully obtained through the freeze-drying process. The electrochemical performances are evaluated by using coin-type cells versus lithium. A high initial reversible capacity of 1132.9 mAh g-1 is obtained at a current density of 100 mA g-1. More importantly, even after 300 cycles at a high current density of 1000 mA g -1, a stable specific capacity of 556.9 mAh g-1 can be achieved, suggesting the graphene nanosheets exhibit superior cycle stability. The fascinating electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the high specific surface area and the increased layer distance between the graphene nanosheets. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a simple and effective vapor phase hydrothermal method was developed to transform a 3D honeycomb structured PS/TTIP hybrid film into a photoactive TiO2 film without dismantling the originally templated 3D structure. The method utilizes the vapor phase hydrothermal process to create titania network/clusters with sufficient mechanical strength via the formation of Ti-oxo bridges. The organic components of the sample can be removed by means of pyrolysis while perfectly maintaining the original 3D honeycomb structure. The resultant film can be directly used for photocatalysis applications and could be further modified for other applications. In principle, this method can be used to preserve 3D structures of other organic/inorganic hybrid films during their conversion to pure inorganic films via a pyrolysis process, if mechanically strong networks can be formed as a result of hydrolysis reactions. The ability to preserve the preferred 3D structure during the subsequent conversion processes enables realization of the full benefit of unique architectures created by a templating method.",

The structure and morphology of the sample were analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that nitrogen atoms were successfully doped into graphene sheets. The TiO2 nanoparticles (8- 13 nm in size) were homogenously anchored on the nitrogen-doped graphene sheets through gas/liquid interface reaction. The as-prepared TiO2/nitrogen-doped graphene nanocomposite shows a better electrochemical performance than the TiO2/graphene nanocomposite and the bare TiO2 nanoparticles.

More importantly, a high reversible capacity of 109 mAh g-1 can still be obtained even at a super high current density of 5000 mA g -1.

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the two most popular functional materials in recent years. In this study, CNTs/TiO(2) composite and TiO(2) photoanodes were fabricated by a dip-coating technique, followed by subsequent calcination. The resultant photoanodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis). The results suggest that the carbon nanotubes were successfully incorporated with the TiO(2) nanoparticulates without damage and that the resultant TiO(2) nanoparticles consisted of anatase and rutile. The CNTs/TiO(2) photoanodes were capable of oxidizing various types of organic compounds (e.g. glucose, potassium hydrogen phthalate, and phenol) in aqueous solutions in a photoelectrochemical bulk cell. In comparison with the pure TiO(2) photoanode, the sensitivity of the photoanode for the detection of organic compounds has been improved by 64%, while the background current was reduced by 80% due to the introduction of the CNTs. These advantages can be ascribed to the improved adsorptivity to organic compounds, increased absorption of UV light and enhanced electron transport at the CNTs/TiO(2) photoanode due to the introduction of the CNTs.",

        "abstract": "Nanoporous TiO2 film electrodes with a mixed anatase/ rutile phase were prepared by dip-coating TiO2 nanoparticle colloid onto Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) conducting glass substrates and a subsequent calcination process at 700 degrees C for 16 h. The photocatalytic oxidation of a wide range of organic compounds has been studied using the photoelectrochemical method under the conditions that the photohole capturing step controls the overall photocatalytic processes. The characteristics of the mixed anatase/ rutile phase TiO2 film electrodes were compared with pure anatase phase TiO2 film electrodes to identify the key differences between them. The results revealed that different organic compounds, despite their difference in chemical entities, can be stoichiometrically mineralized at the mixed-phase TiO2 electrode under diffusion-controlled conditions, which is in great contrast to the situation at the pure anatase phase TiO2 electrode. The exceptional ability of the mixed-phase TiO2 electrodes for mineralization of organic compounds and their remarkable resistance to the inhibition by aromatic compounds at higher concentration has been explained by the synergetic effect of the rutile and anatase phases. For this type of mixed phase electrodes, upon absorption of UV light, the electron-transfer pathway from anatase phase to rutile phase facilitates the separation of photoelectron and photohole, extending the lifetime of the photoelectron and photohole.",

The efficiency of the photoelectrocatalytic decontamination of produced water was determined with both COD removal from the tested wastewater and the decrease of mutagenic activity evaluated by Ames tests. The experimental results showed that the photoelectrocatalysis is a quite efficient process for decontaminating the produced water, although there are high concentration of salt existed in oilfield wastewater. We found that the COD removal efficiencies by photoelectrocatalytic process are much higher than that of by photocatalytic or electrochemical oxidation individually in the photoelectrocatalytic reactor. The COD removal can be substantially improved by the added H2O2 and the generation of active chlorine from high concentration chlorides in the wastewater. The effects of various operating conditions, such as initial COD concentration, applied cell voltage, catalyst amount and initial pH value of solution, on the photoelectrocatalytic efficiencies, is also investigated in detail. The results showed that when the raw produced wastewater was diluted in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, there is a highest COD removal efficiency. And the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in saline water is much favored in acidic solution than that in neutral and/or alkaline solution.",

Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles were synthesized in an aqueous solution of Ni2+ and tert-butylamine in the presence of small amounts of toluene, which induced the nanoparticles to assemble a thin film on the aqueous surface. The obtained Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle film was easily transferred onto the electrode surfaces and exhibited stable electrochemical performance. The electrochemical behavior of various small biomolecules, including cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, histidine, glycine, cystine, methionine, lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, ascorbic acid, uric acid and dopamine, were studied at the Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle-film-modified electrode. The Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle film exhibits excellent direct, unmediated electrocatalysis toward the oxidation of cysteine, homocysteine and ascorbic acid in a pH 7.4 buffer solution with a low onset potential and a high oxidation signal. This behavior differs from many reports in which small organic molecules are electrocatalyzed indirectly by the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox couple in a strongly alkaline solution.",

This method is developed based on a photoelectrochemical degradation principle. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is directly quantified by measuring the amount of electron transferred at a TiO 2 nanoporous thin-film electrode during an exhaustive photoelectrocatalytic degradation process in a thin-layer photoelectrochemical cell. In this fashion, the COD value of a sample can be determined in a simple, rapid and accurate manner. The PECOD is a direct and absolute method that requires no calibration. The effects of important experimental conditions, such as light intensity, applied potential bias, supporting electrolyte concentration and oxygen concentration, on analytical performance have been investigated and optimum experimental conditions were obtained. Analytical linear range of 0\u2212360 ppm COD with a practical detection limit of 0.2 ppm COD were achieved. Real sample analyses were also carried out. The results demonstrated that the measured COD values using the PECOD and the standard methods were in an excellent agreement.

        "abstract": "Due to the poor transportability of sodium ions, conventional sodium ion batteries (SIBs) cannot deliver sufficient capacity for high rate applications. Surface-induced capacitive processes (SCP) (e.g. capacitance and pseudocapacitance) could provide fast charge/discharge capacity in conjunction with the capacity provided by diffusion-controlled intercalation processes (DIP) to address this issue. For the first time, SCP was used to design a hierarchical layered graphene composite as an anode material for high rate SIBs. The contributions of the individual sodium storage processes were quantitatively evaluated, verifying the proposed mechanism. The resultant SCP-enhanced SIB delivers an outstanding rate capacity of 120 mAh/g at 10 A/g, which is among best of the state-of-the-art carbon-based SIBs. It also demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 83.5% capacity of 142 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 2500 cycles.",

        "abstract": "The development of lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries is of practical significance to meet the rapidly escalating demand for advanced energy storage technologies with long life and high-energy density. However, the dissolution and shuttling of the intermediate polysulfides (PS) initiates the loss of active sulfur and the poisoning of the lithium anode, leading to unsatisfactory cyclability and consequently hinders the commercialization of Li\u2013S batteries. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to tame the PS dissolution and the shuttling effect in the Li\u2013S system by introducing a modified polybenzimidazole (mPBI) with multiple functions. As a binder, the excellent mechanical property of mPBI endows the sulfur electrode with strong integrity and, therefore, results in high sulfur loading (7.2\u2009mg\u2009cm\u22122), whereas the abundant chemical interaction between mPBI and PS affords efficient PS adsorption to inhibit sulfur loss and prolong battery life. As a functional agent for the separator, the mPBI builds a PS shield onto the separator to block PS\u2019s migration to further suppress the PS shuttling. The dual actions of mPBI confer an excellent performance of 750\u2009mAh\u2009g\u22121 (or 5.2\u2009mAh\u2009cm\u22122) after 500 cycles at C/5 on the Li\u2013S battery with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle.",

        "abstract": "Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is one of the most important parameters in water quality assessment and monitoring. The natural degradation of nitrogenous organic compounds (NOCs) in water requires significant amounts of oxygen. In the determination of standard COD however, NOCs are persistent compounds that cannot be completely oxidized even in the most oxidative chemical environments, i.e. the reaction media that contain high concentrations of dichromate in strong acid at high temperature. Consequently, the measured COD values of wastewater samples containing NOCs are commonly lower than theoretical COD values and do not reflect the actual oxygen demand of the water body. This problem is partially alleviated when the photoelectrochemical method for COD determination (PeCOD) based on nanostructured TiO(2) photoanode is utilized. To completely overcome this problem, a synergetic photoelectrochemical oxidation effect in thin layer cells is used to achieve complete oxidation of NOCs. This is done by the simple addition of a hydroxyl organic compound (i.e. glucose) into the test sample before the PeCOD measurement. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the synergetic PeCOD method provides an effective and reliable means to measure COD values of NOC-containing pollutants without the need for toxic or expensive reagents.",

Their crystal structure and morphology were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The rutile TiO2 nanoarrays, growing along the [001] direction, consist of highly ordered nanowires (nanorods) rooting at the titanium substrate. The controlled growth of nanoarray films with different nanostructures, including nanowires, nanorods and nanocolumns, can be achieved by adjusting the key experimental parameters, such as growth time, reaction temperature and HCl concentration. Subsequently, the surface morphologies and wettability can be readily tuned. A possible growth mechanism is proposed based on a series of pieces of experimental evidence. The photoelectrochemical properties of the as-prepared rutile nanoarray films were investigated in detail. The photocurrent seems related to the surface morphology of the examined photoanode. \u00a9 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

The COD value is directly quantified by measuring the amount of electrons captured at a nanostructured TiO 2 electrode during the exhaustive photoelectrocatalytic degradation of organic species in the thin-layer cell. The key parameters of the photoelectrochemical system, such as applied potential bias, light intensity and solution pH, were investigated and optimized. Combined with a microelectrochemical system and a laptop computer, the UV-LED PeCOD system enables end-users to perform on-site COD analysis in a simple, rapid, sensitive and accurate manner. Under the optimal conditions, the system can achieve a practical detection limit of 0.2 ppm COD with a linear range of 0\u2013300 ppm COD. The proposed UV-LED PeCOD technology can potentially make a revolutionary improvement to the conventional COD analysis and may be widely used in water quality monitoring industry.

        "abstract": "A series of TiO2 nanorod array electrodes with different lengths have been successfully fabricated by a controlled hydrothermal method for photoelectrochemical (PEC) application. In order to enhance the conductivity of the TiO2 nanorods and enable the PEC activity under visible light irradiation, the TiO2 nanorod samples have been further hydrogenated. The influence of the length of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanorod arrays (H-TNRs) on their visible-light-driven photoelectrocatalytic activity was investigated. With increasing the length of the H-TNRs to about 3.0 \u03bcm, the activity was close to the maximum. Subsequently, the H-TNRs photoanode was fitted into a thin-layer photoelectrochemical cell for mineralization of organic compounds. The visible light PEC performance was enhanced so much that chemical oxygen demand (COD) detection was achieved under visible light as the light source for the first time. The excellent relationship between the photoelectrochemical COD and conventional COD values within the range of 0\u2013288 mg L\u22121 suggests that the simple visible light driven PEC method is a promising alternative to the conventional COD method.",

It was found the reaction time and the amount of Ag nanowires play crucial roles in the formation of well-defined 1D Ag@Cu2O core-shell heteronanowires. The resultant 1D Ag@Cu2O NWs exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity toward degradation of organic contaminants than Ag@Cu2O core-shell nanoparticles or pure Cu2O nanospheres under solar light irradiation. The drastic enhancement in photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance and the electron sink effect of the Ag NW cores, and the unique 1D core-shell nanostructure.",

However, practical application of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries can be achieved only when the major barriers, including the shuttling effect of polysulfides (Li2Sx, x=3~8), the significant volume change (~80%) and the resultant rapid deterioration of electrodes, are tackled. Here, we propose an \"inside-out\" synthesis strategy by mimicking the fruit pomegranate structure to achieve conductive confinement of sulfur to address these issues. In the proposed pomegranate-like structure, sulfur and carbon nanotubes composite is encapsulated by the in-situ formed amorphous carbon network, which allows the regeneration of electroactive material sulfur and the confinement of the sulfur as well as the lithium polysulfide within the electrical conductive carbon network. Consequently, a highly robust sulfur cathode is obtained, delivering remarkable performance in a Li-S battery. The obtained composite cathode shows a reversible capacity of 691 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with impressive cycle stability at the current density of 1600 mA g-1.",

Herein, porous bamboo biochar is activated via a KOH/annealing process that creates a microporous structure, boosts surface area and enhances electronic conductivity. The treated sample is used to encapsulate sulfur to prepare a microporous bamboo carbon-sulfur (BC-S) nanocomposite for use as the cathode for Li-S batteries for the first time. The BC-S nanocomposite with 50 wt.% sulfur content delivers a high initial capacity of 1,295 mA\u00b7h/g at a low discharge rate of 160 mA/g and high capacity retention of 550 mA\u00b7h/g after 150 cycles at a high discharge rate of 800 mA/g with excellent coulombic efficiency (\u2a7e95%). This suggests that the BC-S nanocomposite could be a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries.",

Toluene was chosen as a representative pollutant of VOCs to investigate the degradation mechanism and the parameters affecting photocatalytic degradation efficiency. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the degradation efficiency of toluene increased with the increase of the light irradiation dosage, while it decreased with the increase of concentrations of toluene. The degradation efficiency increased rapidly with the increase of the relative humidity in a low humidity range from 0 to 35%, but decreased gradually in a high relative humidity (i.e.,>[35%). The optimum experimental conditions for toluene degradation is a toluene concentration of 106 mg m-3, a relative humidity of 35%, and an illumination intensity of ca. 6 mW cm-2 at the surface of ZnO/SnO2 photocatalysts. The intermediates produced during the gaseous photocatalytic degradation process were identified using the GC-MS technique. Based on these identified intermediates, the photocatalytic mechanism of toluene into ZnO/SnO2 coupled oxide catalyst was also deduced. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",

        "title": "Development of a generic microelectrode array biosensing system",
        "abstract": "A new type of electrochemical cell has been developed for use in biosensor applications. Utilising a random array of platinum microdiscs as the working electrode, it incorporates a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and platinum auxiliary electrode into the tip of a polished glassy Teflon probe. Immobilisation of the biochemical moiety onto the surface of the probe is achieved using a mixture of polyurethane (PU) and polyethylene oxide (PEO). Enclosing the tip of the probe within a dialysis membrane completes the electrochemical cell. The hydrophilic nature of the PU\u2013PEO mixture ensures the biochemical moiety is trapped in a stable, hydrophilic environment. The result is an all in one generic electrochemical sensor that can be used in a wide range of biosensor applications in both batch or flow injection modes. The unique features of this system are demonstrated in this paper using the glucose \u2014 glucose oxidase (GOD) system. Parameters affecting sensor performance were investigated in both batch and flow injection modes. In terms of sensitivity, reproducibility, equilibration time and linear dynamic range, the performance of the microdisc based sensing system was superior to similar macroelectrode versions. Practical detection limits (0.1 \u03bcM) were four\u2013five orders of magnitude better for this system compared with a conventional electrode system. The advantages of using this system in flow injection mode, particularly in terms of increased linear range, were also addressed. The overall linear range of our system (0.1 \u03bcM\u201360 mM) is three\u2013four orders of magnitude greater than the conventional electrode system. Keywords Biosensor Microelectrode Array Dialysis membrane Glucose Glucose oxidase 1 Introduction The overall performance of an electrochemical biosensor is largely determined by the effectiveness of the interaction between the biochemical recognition moiety and the electrochemical transducer. Poor coupling of these two aspects of biosensor design will result in problems associated with selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, limited dynamic range and stability \u2014 thus, greatly limiting the applicability of these devices in real sensing applications. In practice, these problems may be overcome more readily by investigating new aspects of physical design and fabrication rather than further development of the mechanisms of biorecognition and detection. The present situation in biosensor research is that, on the one hand, hundreds of biochemical recognition systems and tens of different transducers are available for biosensor fabrication, while on the other hand, there are only a very limited number of biosensors commercially available [1\u20134] . This is partly due to the lack of a suitable market for these devices but is also indicative of the fact that the vast majority of biosensing systems reported in the literature are unsuitable for real sensing applications. There is no doubt that the most successful are those in which the design and fabrication principles have specifically addressed the problems of sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, dynamic working range and stability [1\u20138] . Therefore, developing new design and fabrication strategies that combine the specificity of a biorecognition system with the simplicity and sensitivity of electrochemical transduction, will lead to a much broader range of real biosensor applications. We have taken this approach in this study to develop a generic electrochemical-based biosensing system. Design of an electrochemical biosensor normally involves consideration of at least two essential components: (i) choice or fabrication of an electrode substrate of suitable material, size and geometry; and (ii) choice of an appropriate immobilisation matrix and technique. Ideally, the selectivity/specificity of the biosensor stems from the biorecognition moiety but in some circumstances a membrane is also employed to protect the sensing surface from interfering species. These aspects (and more) are considered in our approach and are briefly discussed below. Many different types of electrode substrates and geometries have been used in the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors [8\u201317] . In recent years, the application of microelectrodes to biosensor development has generated a lot of interest [11\u201313,16] . In particular, the use of microelectrode arrays has gained a great deal of attention due to their inherent advantages of fast mass transport, high signal to noise ratio, short time to reach the steady state and the fact that they can be readily mass produced [18\u201325] . In terms of practical use, the last two advantages of microelectrode arrays are very important. Despite this recent focus, detailed studies of microelectrode array behaviour in biosensing applications, especially when the array is set behind a membrane and in contact with the immobilisation layer, have not been reported. From a biosensor design point of view, these advantageous properties need to be explored in such systems. The overall performance and usefulness of biosensors is often dictated by the immobilisation techniques and the immobilisation matrices employed [26\u201327] . Physical adsorption, entrapment of the bioactive species in a polymeric matrix, covalent binding and cross-linking are the four commonly used immobilisation techniques. Of these, entrapment is the most commonly employed method since this is a generic immobilisation method capable of immobilising the widest range of bioactive species. The materials currently used for immobilising bioactive species include inorganic polymers [28] , natural polymers [13,29] , conventional polymers [26\u201327] , conducting polymers [30] and polymer composites [31] . Depending on the nature of the material, the immobilised layer is generally in the form of a thin film (membrane), a three-dimensional gel network or a composite paste. The most important aspect of the immobilisation procedure is that the bioactive species is retained in a stable form within the immobilised layer and that its bioactivity remains sufficiently high to ensure adequate biorecognition and subsequent analytical signal generation. Unfortunately, improvement of enzyme retention and stability within the immobilised matrix is most often attained by increasing the diffusive resistance, thus, sacrificing sensitivity and response time. It is possible, however, to minimise these problems by employing appropriate design and fabrication strategies. As discussed above, the selectivity of a biosensing system is, theoretically, ensured by the biological recognition component. Unfortunately, selectivity is often compromised in the electrochemical detection step due to the similarity of the redox potentials between the target species and interfering species. Contamination of the sensor surface by the sample matrix is another practical problem that can cause failure of electrochemical biosensors. These problems can be improved by employing a membrane that excludes unwanted species from the reaction zone. A typical example of this is the use of a microdialysis membrane, such as in the microdialysis electrode first reported by Albery and co-workers [12] . In this case, the membrane was employed to prevent large interfering macromolecules (present in extracellular fluid) from fouling the platinum electrode surface. While this example was obviously concerned with biomedical applications, a similar approach could be used in environmental applications to prevent fouling from, for example, particulate matter, micro-organisms, etc. Despite the design considerations alluded to above, there are still no generally accepted guidelines for the fabrication of biosensors. In this work, we aim to develop a flexible, generic electrochemical biosensing system that can rapidly detect the target species in a sensitive and reproducible manner. In an attempt to achieve these goals, we have integrated multidisciplinary technologies into our sensing system design. An all-in-one electrochemical biosensing probe has been developed. This sensing device contains a microdisc array working electrode, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum auxiliary electrode ( Fig. 1 ). The water based polyurethane/polyethylene oxide (PU\u2013PEO) colloidal dispersion was employed as the immobilisation matrix. A dialysis membrane was used as an active barrier to prevent the sensing element from fouling. The initial development of the generic biosensing system and the unique features resulting from this development are demonstrated in this paper using the glucose \u2014 glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme system. This system was chosen because it represents the classical test case for a simple enzyme reaction involving detection of a product (i.e. H 2 O 2 ) of the enzymatic reaction. Generic application of this approach to a wider range of biosensing strategies (in both batch and flow injection modes) is trivial and we have so far demonstrated its use in the following systems: simple enzyme systems (i.e. glucose detection using GOD); double catalytic systems (i.e. determination of phenolic compounds using tyrosinase); two enzyme systems (i.e. determination of acetylcholine, using acetylcholine esterase and choline oxidase); enzyme inhibition systems (i.e. determination of organophosphorous pesticides using inhibition of acetylcholine esterase); in immunosensing systems (using biotin/antibiotin); and finally we have also applied the generic sensing system to analysis in organic solvents. All but the first of the above applications are considered in pending papers. This paper concentrates on the design, fabrication and characterisation of the all-in-one electrochemical cell with particular emphasis on the benefits achieved using this system. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemicals and materials All reagents were AR grade purity unless otherwise stated. Glucose oxidase (EC1.1.3.4), 218,200 units/g solid was obtained from Sigma and used as received. Glucose was obtained from Merck. A 40% (w/w) polyurethane\u2013polyethylene oxide water-based colloidal dispersion was donated by IPRI, University of Wollongong, Australia. All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18 M\u03a9 cm). Medical grade O 2 (35% v/v) was obtained from BOC Gases Australia. Dialysis membrane with molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) from 12,000 to 14,000 Da was obtained from Medicell International Ltd. The benzoylated dialysis membrane with MWCO from 1200 to 2000 Da, was purchased from Sigma. Platinum wire (99.9% purity, 10, 25, 50, 125, or 1000 \u03bcm diam) was obtained from Goodfellow Co., UK. Woods metal (melting point 73\u00b0C) was supplied from Chem-Supply Australia. The cell holder was made of glassy Teflon. 2.2 Instrumentation All amperometric detection experiments were carried out using a BAS LC-4C Amperometric Detector (Bioanalytical Systems, USA). All electrochemical data were recorded using Maclab/4e Analog/Digital interfaced with a Power Macintosh computer with Chart 3.5 software from AD Instruments Australia. All electrochemical experiments were conducted using the special home-made, all-in-one electrochemical cell (see Fig. 1 ). A three-electrode system was used throughout this work. The working electrodes used were various diameters of platinum discs from 10 to 1000 \u03bcm. For all experiments, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum auxiliary electrode were employed. The three electrodes were integrated onto a planar surface to form a sensing probe with a diameter of 5.0 mm. A thin immobilisation layer of PU\u2013PEO with GOD was incorporated onto the tip of the sensing probe to form the biosensing probe. A membrane based all-in-one electrochemical cell was constructed by enclosing the biosensing probe within a dialysis membrane. 2.3 Fabrication of platinum microelectrode arrays Individual platinum wires were inserted into soft glass capillary tubes. The desired number of capillary tubes (with platinum) were fused together by means of heating in an open flame. The combined capillary tubes were then sealed into a soft glass tube (i.d. of 3.3 mm) by carefully heating the tip in an open flame. The resulting microelectrode array was cut-back and polished to a mirror-finish (sand paper, followed by 0.05 \u03bcm alumina powder). Electrical connection between the platinum wires and a single copper wire (0.50 mm diam) was achieved using Woods metal. The number of the active microdiscs in an array electrode was confirmed by counting the number of blue colour microdiscs under a microscope after electrochemical deposition of Prussian blue. Fig. 2 shows the photograph of a typical cross-section surface of the microdisc array electrode. 2.4 Enzyme immobilisation and the cell construction A 17,000 units/ml GOD stock solution was prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of GOD into 0.05 M (pH 7.0) potassium phosphate buffer. PU\u2013PEO dispersion was diluted to desired concentration with Milli-Q water and stored at 4\u00b0C. Desired volumes of the GOD and PU\u2013PEO solutions were mixed and cast onto the electrode surface and dried in air for 20 min. The dialysis membrane was cut into 15 mm\u00d715 mm squares, soaked in a 5 mM EDTA solution for half an hour before being washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water. After the working electrode was placed into the bottom half of the cell holder ( Fig. 1 b), the dialysis membrane was placed on top of the immobilisation layer and held in place by the top half of either the batch or flow cell ( Fig. 1 c and d). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the probe design and provides details on the construction of the biosensing cell. There are several novel aspects of this design that are important to the overall performance of the sensing system that set it apart from other biosensor systems reported in the literature. The entire electrochemical cell (including buffer and immobilised enzyme) resides within a stable hydrophilic environment. This allowed reproducible re-use of the biosensor for hundreds of analyses. When the sensor was kept at ambient laboratory conditions with constant use (22\u201325\u00b0C, 50\u201360% relative humidity), responses remained stable over 7 days. Nearly 100% of sensitivity was maintained when the sensor was stored in the fridge (4\u00b0C) for 1 month. The enzyme immobilisation used a water-based PU\u2013PEO colloidal dispersion. The PU component ensured that a uniform, adhesive, immobilisation layer was produced [32\u201333] ; while the PEO (a well-known polyelectrolyte) ensured the film retained a high water content, crucial for long term bioactivity. Addition of GOD to the PU\u2013PEO dispersion resulted in a homogenous mixture that, upon drying, formed a uniform adherent film over the entire surface of the probe (containing all three electrodes). As can be seen in Fig. 1 b, a dialysis membrane was placed over the surface of the probe to complete the electrochemical cell arrangement. This membrane served two major functions and imparted on this design many of the advantageous features of the \u2018Dialysis Electrode\u2019 previously reported [12,34] . First, it stopped any potential leaching of the enzyme from the immobilised matrix into the bulk solution. The second function of the membrane was to act as a sampling device, preventing large molecules (such as other proteins) and/or particulate matter from the sample from interfering with or fouling the electrode surface, whilst still allowing through the smaller analyte molecules. The combination of these two functions resulted in the electrochemical measurement being performed in a well defined, reproducible matrix \u2014 a distinct advantage over other biosensors that employ entrapment immobilisation methods. The geometrically fixed three-electrode arrangement of the sensing probe ( Fig. 1 a) is important as it ensures reproducible electrochemical cell characteristics. This is crucial for obtaining reliable, reproducible responses in any dynamic electrochemical measurement. Another advantage of this all-in-one probe design was that it is readily incorporated into batch or flow cells, allowing both types of analysis (see Fig. 1 c and d). Perhaps the most significant aspect of this configuration, however, is the use of a random array of microdiscs as the sensing (or working) electrode. This feature improved the overall performance of the sensing system, relative to a single microelectrode or a conventional sized electrode, in several ways. Firstly, the microelectrode array retained all the inherent advantages of a single microelectrode, such as enhanced mass transfer and higher S / N ratio, but had the added advantage of the electrode response being the sum of the responses of all the individual elements. Secondly, the overall amplified current that results from the use of arrays allows their use with conventional potentiostat instrumentation, without the need for complex signal amplification and/or electronic shielding. The rapid attainment of steady state conditions, commonly observed at microelectrodes, is another important advantage in amperometric biosensor systems \u2014 particularly where the biofilms are immobilised directly onto the electrode surface [35\u201336] . Typically, such systems require appreciable time periods for the current at the sensing electrode to decay to appropriate levels (after the application of the detection potential) before they can be practically used. In this study, we have noted that microdisc arrays (50 \u03bcm diam or less) decay to near zero currents in a few minutes allowing detection of glucose at levels as low as 10 \u22127 M. The macroelectrode (1.0 mm diam) however, required up to 5 h for currents to decay to levels low enough to allow detection of glucose at 10 \u22125 M \u2014 basically, detection of lower concentrations was not achievable at the macroelectrode. Clearly, decay times at macroelectrodes were not practical and glucose determinations were subsequently restricted to the mM range. While the authors appreciate that the need for sub-\u03bcM glucose determinations is rare, the need for such low levels of detection in other enzyme/substrate systems is definitely required. Specific parameters affecting sensor performance that were investigated include: the molecular weight cut-off of the dialysis membrane; GOD loading; PU\u2013PEO loading; size of the individual microdisc elements; and the number of individual microdisc elements. The overall performance of the microelectrode array based system was then evaluated in both batch and flow injection modes. Each of these is discussed in detail in the following sections. 3.1 Molecular weight cut-off Fig. 3 shows the glucose responses obtained by the microdisc array system using two different molecular weight cut-off dialysis membranes. The two membranes had MWCO values of 12,000\u201314,000 and 1200\u20132000, respectively. Two points worth noting are the relative sensitivities of the responses and the relative response times. The sensitivity of the system employing the 1200\u20132000 MWCO membrane was approximately one-tenth that of the 12,000\u201314,000 membrane (i.e. 3 pA/\u03bcM compared with 31 pA/\u03bcM). To compound this situation, the time required to reach 95% of maximum signal was more than five times longer for the smaller MWCO membrane (i.e. 180 s compared with about 35 s). The trends shown here are not unexpected for membrane controlled processes. Indeed, increasing the MWCO would, in principle, result in enhanced sensitivity and response times. However, results in the following section show that these gains are actually limited by the immobilised GOD/PU\u2013PEO layer. Consequently, the 12000\u201314000 MWCO membrane was chosen for all further work. 3.2 GOD loading/PU\u2013PEO loading The immobilised layer in this work was a combination of the enzyme (GOD) and the immobilisation matrix PU\u2013PEO. The PU\u2013PEO mixture was commercially supplied as a 40% (w/w) water based colloidal dispersion. This dispersion mixed well with GOD to form a homogeneous aqueous mixture. When the GOD/PU\u2013PEO solution was cast onto the electrode surface and dried, a very uniform film was formed. The amount of PU\u2013PEO loaded was critical for the construction of glucose sensor in this work. For example, the more PU\u2013PEO loaded, the more stable the biosensor was and the more GOD could be loaded on the electrode surface. However, the more PU\u2013PEO introduced the thicker the immobilisation layer, the longer the response time and the lower the sensitivity. Both the amount of GOD and the amount of PU\u2013PEO were varied and considered with respect to the response time and sensitivity. Table 1 shows the results obtained by varying the amount of immobilised GOD whilst keeping the amount of immobilised PU\u2013PEO constant. Increasing the GOD levels increased the viscosity of the solution applied to the electrode surface as well as increasing the thickness of the resulting immobilised layer. The results in Table 1 show that GOD levels had a particular effect on sensitivity and response time at both low and high enzyme loading. At the lower end, response time was improved but sensitivity was compromised slightly. This was presumably due to a lack of the enzyme. As the GOD levels were increased the response time also increased, slowly at first then quite significantly at 150 units. Sensitivity also improved with GOD loading to a maximum value at approximately 81 units. Above this value the sensitivity dropped off, due to the increased thickness and viscosity of the immobilised layer. Table 2 shows the results obtained by varying the amount of PU\u2013PEO whilst keeping the amount of immobilised GOD constant. Higher amounts of PU\u2013PEO resulted in slower response times and ultimately decreased sensitivity. It should be noted that when little or no PU\u2013PEO was used, poor reproducibility, poor stability and a decreased linear range was observed. Overall, the most suitable composition of the immobilisation layer was 81 units of GOD and 0.64 \u03bcg PU\u2013PEO. An important conclusion from the results in Tables 1 and 2 was that the dialysis membrane was not solely responsible for the mass transport properties of the overall sensing system. One also needs to consider the thickness and viscosity of the immobilised layer that makes up the biochemical reaction zone as it will affect the transport of glucose, O 2 and H 2 O 2 and, therefore, ultimately affect sensitivity and response time. 3.3 Size of individual array elements One of the most practically useful advantages of employing microelectrodes, compared with electrodes of conventional size, is their ability to attain a steady state current in a relatively short period of time after the imposition of an applied potential. This characteristic is independent of the nature of the current (i.e. whether it is faradaic or capacitative) and has been well documented in conventional electrochemical systems where the electrode is, for example, a bare polished platinum disc [37] . The situation where the electrode is deliberately coated by a polymeric material to alter the physical, chemical and/or biochemical properties of the electrode is less well documented. However, previous work in this laboratory [38,39] has shown that most of the inherent advantages of microelectrodes are maintained when the surface is deliberately altered. In particular, while steady state currents are not attained as quickly as at a bare electrode, they are nonetheless attained at rates much quicker than the corresponding modified macroelectrode. We have observed the same advantages in the present work with the microelectrode array system. Table 3 shows the results of responses obtained at varying electrode diameters for the detection of a 1.0 mM solution of glucose. While the absolute sensitivity increases with an increase in electrode surface area (as expected) the current density is significantly greater at the smaller electrodes. This was also one of the expected characteristics of microelectrodes and was due to the enhanced mass transport typically observed at these electrodes. Interestingly, in this case, it was the transport of H 2 O 2 generated from within the biochemical reaction zone that we refer to. The response times shown in Table 3 were almost identical in all cases. This was expected because the response times under such conditions were principally determined by the membrane transport kinetics and the thickness and viscosity of the immobilised layer. The most important results in Table 3 are the equilibration times, which refer to how quickly the background current dropped to a stable value when a potential of +0.60 V was applied. In the case of the smaller electrodes (<50 \u03bcm) this was achieved within 15 min. The equilibration time of the microdisc array electrode was just slightly longer than that of single microelectrode, in the range of 10\u201320 min. In the case of the macroelectrode (1.0 mm) this took up to 5 h. In practical terms, this mitigated against the use of the macroelectrode since it took an inordinate amount of time for the background currents to decay to levels where meaningful measurements can be made. Because of this, the practical working range of the macroelectrode system was restricted to the mM concentration range. The microdisc array system on the other hand, whose current had decayed to negligible levels within a few minutes, could be extended down to 100 nM. The calculated detection limit was actually as low as 20 nM ( S / N >3). Choice of the optimum electrode size was a trade off between maintaining ideal microelectrode behaviour and maximising the analytical signal. In many respects this choice will be application dependent, but in this case the 50 \u03bcm diameter disc was chosen. This size was both large enough to have adequate sensitivity for use with conventional instrumentation and small enough to display the advantages of microelectrodes, particularly in terms of reasonably rapid equilibration times and high S / N ratio. 3.4 Number of individual array elements Maximising the analytical signal was further achieved using an array of microelectrodes. As alluded to earlier, the advantage of using a microelectrode array is that the inherent properties of individual microelectrodes are maintained while the analytical signal is the sum of the responses of all the individual elements. Table 4 shows the results of responses obtained at 50 \u03bcm diameter electrode arrays of varying numbers for the detection of a range of glucose concentrations. As expected of arrays where the individual elements act independently, the sensitivity increased linearly with the number of elements. From an analytical point of view, an array with as many elements as possible is obviously ideal. This was, however, offset by the practical difficulty of fabricating probes with large numbers of Pt discs. Consequently, the optimum array size was considered to be 50. More recent versions of this cell design have incorporated microlithographically produced arrays where the number of elements is only limited by the physical space of the probe and the need to ensure the elements act independently. An interesting feature of Table 4 is that the linear range for glucose determinations was extended at both the upper and lower concentration ranges. The extension at the lower range was the result of increased S / N ratio as the number of array elements increased. The extension of linearity at the upper concentration range was the result of a more subtle effect and is discussed in detail in the following section. 3.5 Overall performance 3.5.1 Batch analysis mode Figs. 4 and 5 shows the amperometric responses obtained by the microarray based cell (50\u00d750 \u03bcm disc array) in batch mode for glucose in the nM and mM ranges, respectively. Linearity over four orders of magnitude and sensitivity down to 100 nM for glucose analysis is testimony to the quality of the cell design. Optimum configurations of electrodes, immobilisation layer and membrane have ensured that, within this concentration range, the mass transport of glucose is the rate limiting step. The efficiency of the cell design was further highlighted by the fact that lack of linearity beyond 3.5 mM was actually the result of limited O 2 availability [40,41] . Fig. 5 shows how the linearity of the response was extended to 15 mM by saturating the solution with O 2 . Interestingly, the upper linear range for the macroelectrode, without O 2 saturation, was found to be approximately 6 mM \u2014 i.e. twice that observed at the microarray system. This was explained by two factors. The first was that consumption of H 2 O 2 at the electrode surface actually regenerated O 2 within the biochemical reaction zone. This was then available for further catalytic turnover of glucose. Obviously, this occurred to a much more significant degree for the macroelectrode (having a much larger surface area and overall Faradic current) than the microelectrode systems. The small increase in linear range with an increase in electrode numbers, noted in Table 4 , can also be explained by this phenomenon, since more electrodes consume more H 2 O 2 and thus produce more O 2 within the reaction zone. The second reason for the increased upper linear range at the macroelectrode was the difference in the diffusive mass transport of O 2 , produced at the electrode surface. Transport of O 2 away from the electrode surface is much slower at the macroelectrode (planar diffusion) than at the microelectrode (spherical diffusion). This results in significantly more O 2 accumulation at the macroelectrode surface, thus, resulting in an increased linear range on macroelectrode. Both operational and storage stability are important from the practical application point of view. The operational stability of the sensing system was examined during a 7-day period with 20 successive sample injections each day at room temperature (25\u00b0C). No significant sensitivity change was observed during the 7-day test. The storage stability was also examined during a period of 90 days with seven sample injections every 10 days. When the probe was not in use, it was stored in the buffer under 4\u00b0C in a refrigerator. No significant activity loss was observed during this period of investigation. A reproducibility of 1.1% R.S.D. was obtained from 20 replicated injections of 1.0 \u03bcM glucose. 3.5.2 Flow injection analysis mode The authors appreciate that in most applications of glucose monitoring, linearity in the mM (i.e. physiological) concentration range is more important than sensitivity down to the nM range. It should be remembered, however, that this system was designed as a generic biosensing system capable of being used in many different biosensing applications \u2014 many of which require sensitivity as the principle property needing optimisation. Having said that, for glucose analysis, an upper linear range of 3.5 mM in the batch mode is not suitable for most applications. Consequently, the versatility of the present system was no better demonstrated than in its use in a flow system. Fig. 6 shows that linearity up to 60 mM was practically possible in flow mode simply by changing parameters, such as flow rate and/or injection volume. This can be attributed to the dynamic mass transfer mechanism of flow system. In such a system, the hydrodynamic flow conditions dramatically affect the rate of mass transport to the electrode surface. This effect becomes more obvious for a system that involves membrane transport processes. In our system, the dialysis membrane was employed as a sampler. In other words, the concentration of analytes in the detection zone is controlled by the membrane transport process. In a flow system for a given membrane, this will be determined by the concentration, injection volume and flow rate. For a given concentration, a small injection volume coupling with a fast flow rate results in a low concentration of analytes in the detection zone, hence the sensitivity was decreased and the upper linear range was extended. Conversely, employing a large injection volume with a slow flow rate extended the lower detection linear range. The operational stability and the storage stability of the sensing system in flow mode were also examined under the same conditions used in the batch mode. The results revealed that the sensitivity decreased by 10% during the operational stability test \u2014 this decrease was constant over the 7-day period. The storage stability test showed no significant loss in activity. The reproducibility of the sensing system in the flow mode was slightly decreased, with a R.S.D. ( n =20) of 1.5% for 100 \u03bcM glucose. 4 Conclusion The design, fabrication and characterisation of a unique all-in-one microelectrode array based biosensing probe have been described. The advantages of using microelectrodes, particularly in terms of improved signal to noise ratio and relatively rapid attainment of steady state background currents were demonstrated in the determination of glucose using glucose oxidase. The versatility of the system was demonstrated by ready application of the probe into both batch and flow injection modes. Facile control over both sensitivity and linear range was therefore possible. The linear dynamic range of the probe was three\u2013four orders of magnitude greater than at a corresponding macroelectrode system. Furthermore, practical limits of detection were improved by four\u2013five orders of magnitude relative to a conventional size macroelectrode design. Whilst detection levels at sub-\u03bcM levels are not always important in glucose detection, these results show that the efficiency of the transport processes, using the cell described, are appropriate in a generic sense. Application of this system has subsequently been successfully applied to a number of other biosensing applications including the determination of phenol (in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents), the detection of choline and acetylcholine and the determination of organophosphorus pesticides.

The experimental results show that after an annealing process, the starting amorphous nanotubes have been turned into anatase phase structures, and the tube walls have been decorated with nanoparticles, different from the original ridged nanotubes. Furthermore, the anatase phase nanotubes have demonstrated better photocatalytic properties than their amorphous counterparts, which is caused by the larger surface area and improved crystallinity. With respect to FE properties, the as-grown nanotubes have the lower turn-on field E(to) and the higher field enhancement factor \u03b2 compared to the annealed nanotubes.

        "abstract": "Aquatic ammonia has toxic effects on aquatic life. This work reports a gas-permeable membrane-based conductivity probe (GPMCP) developed for real-time monitoring of ammonia in aquatic environments. The GPMCP innovatively combines a gas-permeable membrane with a boric acid receiving phase to selectively extract ammonia from samples and form ammonium at the inner membrane interface. The rate of the receiving phase conductivity increase is directly proportional to the instantaneous ammonia concentration in the sample, which can be rapidly and sensitively determined by the embedded conductivity detector. A pre-calibration strategy was developed to eliminate the need for an ongoing calibration. The analytical principle and GPMCP performance were systematically validated. The laboratory results showed that ammonia concentrations ranging from 2 to 50,000 \u00b5g L(-1) can be detected. The field deployment results demonstrated the GPMCP's ability to obtain high resolution continuous ammonia concentration profiles and the absolute average ammonia concentration over a prolonged deployment period. By inputting the temperature and pH data, the ammonium concentration can be simultaneously derived from the corresponding ammonia concentration. The GPMCP embeds a sophisticated analytical principle with the inherent advantages of high selectivity, sensitivity and accuracy, and it can be used as an effective tool for long-term, large-scale, aquatic-environment assessments.",

        "abstract": "Periphyton biofilms are natural mixtures comprised of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic complex microorganisms. In this work, the inhibition effects of periphyton biofilms on cyanobacterial blooms were studied in pilot and field trials. Results show that the cyanobacterial species responsible for the blooms had an upper nutrient concentration threshold, below which it could not effectively compete with other organisms in the periphyton. The disappearance of the cyanobacterial blooms was due to the allelopathy between the cyanobacteria and periphyton biofilm. In particular, it was found that the periphyton biofilm could produce water-soluble allelochemicals such as indole and 3-oxo-\u03b1-ionone to significantly inhibit the growth of the cyanobacteria. These allelochemicals are able to damage the thylakoid membranes of the cyanobacteria, interrupt the electron transport in photosystem II, decrease effective quantum yields, and eventually lead to the failure of photosynthesis. A comprehensive discussion on the ecological consequences of these findings is also presented. This work demonstrates the potential of periphyton biofilm to be used as an environmentally friendly ecological engineering solution for (i) the control of cyanobacterial blooms and (ii) a transitional means for the construction of beneficial conditions for ecosystem restoration. In addition, this work provides significant insights into the competitive relationships between algae and biofilms.",

        "title": "A comparative study between photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic properties of Pt deposited TiO2 thin films for glucose degradation",
        "abstract": "This study compares the photocatalytic (PC) and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) oxidation of glucose by Pt\u2013TiO 2 films under similar conditions. The overall oxidation efficiency of the PEC process was better than the PC process, for both TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. The Pt deposits enhanced the PEC oxidation efficiency of glucose at low cathodic (\u22120.1 V) and low anodic potential bias (+0.1 V). As the applied anodic bias was increased to >+0.5 V, the undoped-TiO 2 films outperformed their Pt\u2013TiO 2 counterparts. This suggests that in the studied systems, at an anodic bias of >+0.5 V, more holes were available for the oxidation of glucose on the surface of TiO 2 compared to Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. In the PEC systems, above a certain applied bias, Pt deposits may have a detrimental effect on the performance of a PEC system because the Pt deposits could merely block the surface of TiO 2 (particularly at the highest Pt loadings). Lower measured photocurrents from Pt\u2013TiO 2 films compared to undoped-TiO 2 and a decrease in the photocurrent as the Pt loading increased corroborate this postulation. Keywords Platinum Titanium dioxide Photocatalysis Photoelectrocatalysis Glucose 1 Introduction The titanium dioxide photocatalysis process has been investigated rigorously for the remediation of contaminated water and air [1\u20133] . Surface metallization of TiO 2 by the photodeposition technique is most commonly used to improve the quantum efficiency of the process [4\u201312] , which would otherwise be limited to the order of 1% or less due to rapid electron\u2013hole recombination. The use of the electrochemical approach to enhance the photocatalytic process has been demonstrated to improve the quantum efficiency of such a light driven process [13\u201318] . The application of an anodic bias directs most of the photogenerated electrons away from the conduction band of TiO 2 , hence lowering electron\u2013hole recombination events and promoting hole transfer to organic contaminants at the interface. To date, most TiO 2 surface platinization has been on TiO 2 particles for slurry-type photocatalytic systems rather than on TiO 2 thin films. The effect of Pt deposition on TiO 2 photocatalysis has been reported to vary, and has been found to depend on the pollutant that is being degraded [5,19] . When a beneficial effect of Pt is observed, it is frequently proposed that the establishment of a space charge layer at the Pt\u2013TiO 2 junction accelerates the removal of photoelectrons from the semiconductor and their transfer to oxygen or other electron acceptors in the solution [4,20,21] . This is said to not only decrease the incidence of photogenerated electron\u2013hole recombination [22] , but also to promote the reduction of oxygen, which has been identified as a possible rate-limiting step in the photocatalytic oxidation of some organics [23] . Additionally, the performance enhancement of Pt deposits has also been attributed to the dark catalysis displayed by Pt\u2013TiO 2 [14] , which could potentially be via dehydrogenation [4] , oxidative dehydrogenation or hydrolysis by the Pt deposits [5] . As our recent work illustrated [5] , the influence of the Pt deposition is governed by the nature of the organics being oxidized. The effects of TiO 2 platinization could also depend on the oxidation state of the photodeposited Pt [9] . Lee and Choi reported Pt 0 as the most active oxidation state of the Pt deposits [9] , while Teoh et al. found that there is an intricate inter-relationship between the Pt oxidation state and the degradation pathway of the organic compound [7] . Studies on Pt\u2013TiO 2 thin films for photoelectrocatalysis processes are limited [14,24,25] and implications thereof are not fully known nor understood. A direct extrapolation of findings from Pt platinization of TiO 2 powders to thin film photocatalysis or thin photoelectrocatalysis cannot be drawn, as the charge carrier dynamics are rather different. It is well known that charge transport, consumption and recombination processes are important attributes that determine the kinetics, efficiency and reaction pathway of a photocatalytic degradation process. In these regards, a PC process differs remarkably from a PEC process. In a PC process, both oxidation and reduction half reactions occur at different locations on the same TiO 2 crystals/particles. The reduction half reaction relies purely on the presence of molecular oxygen or other electron acceptors to remove the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band. This is often a limiting step of the overall reaction due to the low concentration of available electron acceptors near the surface. Under such circumstances, surface deposited Pt could act as a \u2018catalyst\u2019 to facilitate the photoelectron consumption or the reduction half reaction, leading to an enhanced overall efficiency. In case of a PEC process, the oxidation and reduction half reactions occur separately at the anode and cathode, respectively. This physical separation of oxidation and reduction half reactions in addition to an appropriate applied potential bias makes a PEC process independent of electron acceptor concentration [26,27] . This is because the applied potential bias serves as an external driving force to remove the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band to the external circuit then to the auxiliary electrode (cathode) where the forced reduction half reactions take place. In other words, photoelectron consumption in a PEC process is very different to that of a PC process. For this reason, the role of deposited Pt on a TiO 2 surface in a PEC process could be different to that of a PC process. When comparing the Pt platinization of TiO 2 powders to thin film photocatalysis or thin photoelectrocatalysis, there are other differences that need to be highlighted. When TiO 2 powders are suspended in an aqueous suspension, charge carrier recombination occurs on the surface or in the bulk of one TiO 2 particle (alternatively, this could involve a few TiO 2 particles if agglomerates are present). However, in the case of TiO 2 films, charge carriers migrate throughout the whole film. This process involves multi-grain interfacial transfers. Therefore, electron\u2013hole recombination in films is expected to be greater in TiO 2 films due to multi-recombination within grain volumes and at grain interfaces. Hence, the photoactivity of TiO 2 films is often influenced by 2 important parameters, film thickness and film porosity [28] . Finally, He et al. [14] showed that differences in preparation methods of Pt deposited TiO 2 can also lead to differences in film properties (when compared to powders), possibly manifesting themselves as variations in Pt deposit size. Such differences can lead to differences in mechanisms (dark catalytic combined with photoelectrochemical in films) as opposed to only photoelectrochemical in powders dip-coated as films. In this context, a comparative study of PC and PEC degradation processes under comparable conditions would be of scientific and practical interest, as it would allow for a better understanding of the mechanistic role of deposited Pt in PC and PEC processes. To ensure the experimental conditions are comparable, both PC and PEC experiments were carried out using the same thin-layer photo(electrochemical)-catalytic system, consisting of a reaction cell and a detection cell. A series of Pt\u2013TiO 2 films with varying amounts of Pt deposits were prepared and tested for the oxidation of glucose. The oxidation efficiencies were compared and analyzed as a function of surface Pt content, applied potential bias and glucose concentration. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass slides were purchased from Delta Technologies Ltd. (USA). Hexachloroplatinic acid (99%, Unilab), titanium (IV) tetraisopropoxide (97%, Aldrich), isopropanol (99.5%, Ajax), glucose (99%, BHD) and NaClO 4 (Ajax) were used as received. Milli-Q water (Millipore, Milli-Q Plus) was used for preparing all solutions. The pH of the solution was adjusted either with NaOH or HClO 4 . 2.2 Preparation and characterization of Pt\u2013TiO 2 films A TiO 2 sol was prepared according to the method by Day et al. [29] . Titanium tetraisopropoxide, TTIP was hydrolyzed with a 0.5 equiv. of water in isopropanol at ambient temperature. The mixture was then refluxed at 78 \u00b0C for 20 h to yield a transparent sol. The sol was deposited on the ITO glass substrates (75 mm \u00d7 15 mm \u00d7 1 mm) by using a dipping unit. The substrates were dip-coated once for 30 s and lifted out of the dipping solution at a speed of 2.3 mm s \u22121 . The coated slides were dried in air and then annealed in a muffle furnace at 450 \u00b0C for 30 min. Platinum was deposited on TiO 2 films photochemically from a hexachloroplatinic acid solution, H 2 PtCl 6 (pH 3) in the presence of 0.05 M of oxalic acid. By adjusting the concentration of hexachloroplatinic acid solution from 0.1 to 1.0 mM, the amount of platinum deposited was varied. The Pt\u2013TiO 2 films prepared were identified by the platinum ion loading added to the solution prior to illumination. The morphology of the TiO 2 films was observed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Phillips CM-200) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The phase content of the TiO 2 film coated on ITO glass was analyzed by a Philips X\u2019Pert MRD X-ray diffractometer, using graphite monochromatic copper radiation (Cu-K\u03b1) at 45 kV, 40 mA over the 2 \u03b8 range of 20\u201380\u00b0. A surface chemical analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB220iXL) using an Al-K\u03b1 source (1486.6) in an ultra high vacuum chamber (25 \u00d7 10 \u221210 mbar). Photoelectrons were collected by a hemispherical analyzer at 90\u00b0 take-off angles. The spectra were calibrated with the C1s peak at 284.7 eV. 2.3 Photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic tests PC and PEC experiments were carried out in batch mode in the reaction cell of a serial thin-layer photo(electrochemical)-catalytic system, as shown in Fig. 1 . The reaction cell thickness was 0.25 mm, the illumination area was 489 mm 2 and the cell volume was 160 mm 3 . For the PEC experiments, a platinum disc was used as the counter electrode. The illumination source for the reaction cell was a UV-LED array which consisted of 4 pieces of UV-LED (NCCU033(T), Nichia Corporation). The specified peak wavelength of the UV-LED was 365 nm and the spectrum half width was 8 nm. The UV-LED array optical outputs were adjusted by a power supply. The UV intensity impinging on the electrode surface was measured to be 25 mW cm \u22122 using an UV-irradiance meter (UV-A, Beijing Normal University). Prior to illumination, the reaction cell was filled with the reaction solution with a known concentration of glucose in a supporting electrolyte (2.0 M NaClO 4 ). The pH of the solution was approximately 6. The oxidation of glucose was initiated by illuminating the cell. Typically, the reaction took 20 min for completion. The exit solution from the reaction cell was subsequently pumped to a down-stream detection cell. The operation of the detection cell was based on an exhaustive PEC degradation process, PECOD method. This method integrates the photocurrent originating from the photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds to quantify the extent of degradation. Details on the design and operation of the detection cell can be found in previous works [26,30] . A potentiostat (Model 362, Princeton Applied Research) was used to apply potential bias in reaction and detection cells. Potential and current signals were recorded using a computer coupled with a data acquizition system (e-corder, eDAQ Pty. Ltd.). 2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were obtained in a three-electrode electrochemical cell containing 100 cm 3 of 0.1 M NaClO 4 as supporting electrolyte with a quartz window for illumination. The exposed area of working TiO 2 or Pt\u2013TiO 2 electrodes for photoelectrochemical reactions was 0.79 cm 2 . A saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and a platinum plate were used as the reference and the auxiliary electrodes, respectively. The pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 6 at the beginning of all experiments. UV illumination was provided using 150 W Xenon arc lamp light source and focusing lenses (Beijing Optical Instruments) in conjunction with a UV band pass filter (UG-5, Schott). This assembly provided UV irradiation in 230\u2013400 nm at intensity of 6.6 mW cm \u22122 , as measured with a UV-irradiance meter (UV-A, Beijing Normal University). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Chemical composition of Pt deposits Fig. 2 shows the TEM micrograph of a typical TiO 2 film prepared by the dipping method as described earlier. Here, the lattice fringe is clearly evident, signifying the high crystallinity of the deposited TiO 2 film. The XRD analysis showed that the TiO 2 film consisted of anatase. Peaks corresponding to rutile and brookite were not observed. As mentioned earlier, Pt was deposited photochemically onto the TiO 2 films. Fig. 3 shows XPS spectra for the platinized TiO 2 film obtained using 1.0 mM H 2 PtCl 6 solution in the platinum (Pt4f), titanium (Ti2p) and oxygen (O1s) regions (70\u201379, 455\u2013465 and 529\u2013533 eV, respectively). In the platinum region, the spectrum could be deconvoluted into three pairs of doublets. The Pt4f 7/2 and Pt4f 5/2 peaks at 70.33 and 70.93 eV; 73.36 and 73.94 eV, respectively, were attributed to atomic state Pt(0), while the third pair at ca. 72.72 and 75.93 eV corresponded to the oxidation states of Pt(II). The peak values agree fairly well with previously published data [31,32] . By comparing the normalized peak areas, Pt(0) was found to be the dominant species (\u223c90%). The Pt(II) group (\u223c10%) could be attributed to the presence of PtO and Pt(OH) 2 on the film surface since oxygen has a high tendency to chemisorb on the clean platinum surface during storage under ambient conditions and oxidize the Pt species [33] . The titanium peak at 458.90 eV was used as the binding energy reference in this analysis ( Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 C shows the O1s spectrum centered at 529.86 eV. This is a characteristic peak for metal oxides and agrees with O1s electron binding energy for a TiO 2 molecule [34] . All other Pt\u2013TiO 2 samples displayed similar XPS characteristics as the 1.0-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 sample presented here. From the normalized peak area, the surface loading of atomic Pt deposits (Pt(0):Ti atomic percentage) was quantified to be approximately 3.8%, 12.2% and 26.5% for the films prepared at 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mM H 2 PtCl 6 , respectively. 3.2 Photocatalytic performance In Fig. 4 , the results of the photocatalytic degradation experiments are presented. This figure shows the amount of glucose oxidized photocatalytically by TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films under UV illumination using Pt\u2013TiO 2 with various Pt loadings and at different initial glucose concentrations. At an initial glucose concentration of 0.05 mM 20% (0.0016 \u03bcmole) was mineralized by the undoped-TiO 2 film. For the same initial glucose concentration (0.05 M), Pt\u2013TiO 2 films prepared using 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mM Pt solution oxidized 37% (0.003 \u03bcmole), 50% (0.004 \u03bcmole) and 28% (0.0022 \u03bcmole) of glucose, respectively. Hence, the Pt deposition on the TiO 2 films surface exhibited a net beneficial effect for the photocatalytic degradation of glucose. An optimum Pt loading was obtained with the 0.5-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 sample. There are several reasons for a decrease in the photocatalytic performance above an optimum loading and these have been discussed in the literature [35,36] . For example, it is noted that the 1.0-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 sample had a surface loading of 26.5% Pt, this high loading is believed to lead to UV shielding. Additionally, at higher Pt loadings, the Pt deposits occupy a significant number of the reactive surface sites, hence resulting in fewer reactive sites for the degradation of glucose. This was also suggested by Chen et al. [37] for Pt\u2013TiO 2 photocatalytic systems when used for the generation of H 2 from methanol. An analogy is drawn here to Se\u2013TiO 2 systems in which Se deposits were shown to occur preferentially on the surface irregularities of TiO 2 that are believed to be more active [38] . As also shown in Fig. 4 , as the initial concentration of glucose was increased to 0.1, 0.15 and 0.02 M, the presence of an optimum Pt loading was again observed. It can be seen here that the beneficial effect of platinum for the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose was greater at the higher glucose concentration. These results can be explained as follows: the rate of the photooxidation reaction is a function of the concentrations of organic and active species present in solution at a given time, as shown by Eq. (1) , where [S*] is the concentration of active species, [C] is the concentration of organic substrate and k reaction is the rate constant [39] . The active species include photogenerated holes and electrons, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radicals: (1) d C O 2 d t = k r e a c t i o n [ C ] [ S * ] At low glucose loadings, it is believed that the concentration of active species ([S*]) is in excess of the glucose concentration ([C]) and the reaction rate is therefore not affected by [S*]. At higher glucose loadings, [C] \u226b [S*], and the photooxidation reaction becomes limited by [S*]. Under these conditions, an increase in electron\u2013hole recombination will result in a decrease in [S*], hence the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination plays a significant role in determining the observed photooxidation rate of glucose [13,39] . 3.3 Photoelectrocatalytic performance Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent response of TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films as a function of applied potential. The photocurrent of the films varied with applied potential and Pt content. In the absence of UV illumination, there was no measured current for all films (curve E). It is interesting to note that when applying a cathodic potential bias (i.e.,\u22120.1 V) or a small anodic potential bias (i.e., +0.1 V), the undoped-TiO 2 films showed an almost equal photocurrent to the 0.1-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 film, and when the applied potential bias was more positive than +0.5 V, the photocurrent in the undoped-TiO 2 superseded that of the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. Additionally, the resulting saturation current under a potential bias was found to decrease as the Pt content increased. The flatband edge potentials can also be derived from Fig. 5 . The method we used to derive the flatband potential is based on the measurement of the \u201con-set\u201d potential. The applied potential bias to the photocatalyst anode serves the function of motive force to drive the electron movement inside the semiconductor photocatalyst layer. For a n-type semiconductor electrode, when the applied potential is below the conduction band edge (or below the flatband potential), there would be no electrons withdrawn from the semiconductor. As a result there is no anodic current observed. The on-set potential in this work refers to the potential at which anodic photocurrent begins to be measured. At these potentials, all the photogenerated charge carriers recombine without producing a net current flow [40,41] . As can be seen from Fig. 5 , the apparent flatband potential of the TiO 2 film was \u22120.28 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The apparent flatband potentials for the 0.1-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 , 0.5-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 and 1.0-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 films were \u22120.27, \u22120.26 and \u22120.24 V, respectively. This slight shift in potential with Pt deposition suggests surface energetic distribution changes by the deposited metal. In the first set of PEC experiments, the effect of applied potential bias was investigated. Fig. 6 shows the amount of glucose oxidized by TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films under applied potential bias ranging from \u22120.1 to +0.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl), while Fig. 7 shows the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose by TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films at different initial concentrations of glucose at an applied anodic potential of +0.9 V. Firstly, from a comparison between the photocatalytic results presented in Fig. 4 with the photoelectrocatalytic results presented in Fig. 6 , it is clear that higher glucose photooxidation efficiencies were achieved using the PEC system compared to the PC system, using both TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films at an anodic bias of +0.9 V. From Fig. 6 , it can be seen that the highest extent of glucose oxidation occurred under anodic bias +0.5 V with the undoped-TiO 2 film. These conditions achieved 90% (0.015 \u03bcmole) glucose oxidation. The 0.1-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 films had the second highest efficiency, followed by 0.5-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 and 1.0-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. The use of the 1.0-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 film in the PEC cell achieved approximately 75% (0.013 \u03bcmole) glucose oxidation. From these results it is also clear that undoped-TiO 2 electrodes at times out-preformed Pt\u2013TiO 2 electrodes depending on the applied potential bias. At an applied cathodic potential bias of \u22120.1 V, the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films displayed higher glucose oxidation efficiency than the undoped-TiO 2 films. This could be due to the electron reactions playing a bigger role in the indirect oxidation of organics under cathodic conditions (in reactions involving superoxide radicals for example) [25] , particularly on the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films given that they favour electron transfer to oxygen in solution. At a low anodic potential bias (+0.1 V), the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films also outperformed their undoped-TiO 2 counterparts. Here, it is believed that under these anodic conditions, the hole driven oxidation reactions were favoured on the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. This is believed to be due to enhanced electron\u2013hole separation brought about by the Pt deposits, which are able to transfer the photogenerated electrons away. The dark catalytic effects of the Pt deposits may have also played a role [14] . As the anodic potential bias increased further (+0.3 V and above), the undoped-TiO 2 films began to outperform the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. This could mean that under these conditions, more holes were available for the oxidation of glucose on the surface of TiO 2 than on the surface Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. We postulate that at a higher anodic potential the oxidation of glucose was no longer limited by electron\u2013hole recombination (since the anodic bias minimized electron accumulation), however it may have become limited by the generation of electrons and hole pairs which was greater in the undoped-TiO 2 films due to shielding of the TiO 2 surface by the Pt deposits [13,14] . The higher photocurrent in the undoped-TiO 2 and the decrease in photocurrents with increased Pt loading reaffirm this postulation. It is noted that as the potential bias is increased to +0.5 V and greater, the oxidation efficiency plateaus. This can be explained by the fact that the potential bias provides an electromotive force that pulls the photogenerated electrons to the counter electrode, hence reducing charge carrier recombination and increasing the availability of active species. However, the number of active species that can be achieved in the TiO 2 or Pt\u2013TiO 2 films is fixed, and it is because of this that after a certain anodic bias, the efficiency plateaus [13] . These findings are significant for application purposes, where optimum conditions for PEC systems need to be identified for either TiO 2 or Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. Optimum PEC conditions could also be dependent on the nature of the organic that is being degraded and its redox potential. Fig. 7 shows the amount of glucose oxidized at different initial glucose concentrations using TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films in the PEC system. A potential bias of +0.9 V was applied for all runs. When comparing the degree of oxidation at different initial concentrations, the undoped-TiO 2 film had the highest PEC activity by oxidizing 90% (0.015 \u03bcmole) of the glucose initially present in the system. A slight detrimental effect in glucose oxidation was observed when using the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films at all glucose concentrations compared to the undoped-TiO 2 films. As discussed earlier in Section 3.2 , at the higher glucose concentrations the rate of oxidation of glucose is expected to be limited by the availability of active species (such as holes, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals). The undoped-TiO 2 surface seems to provide more active sites than its Pt\u2013TiO 2 film counterparts at the applied potential bias of +0.9 V. Among the platinized films, the 0.1-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 and 0.5-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 films had similar activities, while 1.0-mM Pt\u2013TiO 2 film had the lowest activity. The presence of an optimum Pt loading was observed and explained earlier. The effect of oxygen concentration on the efficiency of both the PC and PEC processes was also studied. In most cases, due to the limited amount of oxygen dissolved in the solution (<10 ppm at 25 \u00b0C, 1 atm), the interfacial oxygen reduction is the rate-limiting step of the overall photocatalytic reaction and therefore controls the efficiency of the system. This is evident in Fig. 8 which shows that the amount of glucose oxidized in the PC reaction increased significantly with an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration. In the case of the PEC system, oxidation of glucose was essentially independent of dissolved oxygen concentration. This reaffirms that at +0.9 V, the oxidation of glucose was predominantly hole driven as expected under anodic bias conditions. 4 Conclusion The overall oxidation efficiency of the PEC process was better than the PC process, for both TiO 2 and Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. At an applied cathodic potential bias, the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films displayed higher glucose oxidation efficiency than the undoped-TiO 2 films. This could be due to the electron reactions playing a bigger role in the indirect oxidation of organics under cathodic conditions particularly on the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films given that they favour electron transfer to oxygen in solution. At a low anodic potential bias (+0.1 V), the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films also outperformed their undoped-TiO 2 counterparts. Here, it is believed that under these anodic conditions, the hole driven oxidation reactions were favoured on the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. This is believed to be due to enhanced electron\u2013hole separation brought about by the Pt deposits, which are able to transfer the photogenerated electrons away. As the applied potential bias was increased further, the undoped-TiO 2 films showed higher photooxidation rates than the Pt\u2013TiO 2 films. The Pt deposits may have had a detrimental effect since the Pt deposits may have blocked the surface of TiO 2 , hence reducing the number of surface active sites (particularly at the highest Pt loadings). Lower measured photocurrents from Pt\u2013TiO 2 films compared to undoped-TiO 2 and a decrease in the photocurrent as the Pt loading increased corroborate this postulation.

Many of these developments have been incorporated into the present study, which we are undertaking in the development of our immunosensor technology. The system described here utilises screen-printed electrodes which are low-cost, disposable devices that are simple to fabricate. Incorporated into our sensor is the electroactive polymer, polyaniline, which brings about mediatorless redox coupling between the electrode and biomolecular components attached to the polymer surface. This system also utilises enzyme-labelled antibodies as the biomolecular recognition component for the analysis of the test analyte, biotin. The system has also been integrated into a flow injection system. This has led to the monitoring of real-time antibody-antigen interactions using electrochemical methods and foreshadows the development of single-step immunosensors.",

        "abstract": "Si has attracted enormous research and manufacturing attention as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) because of its high specific capacity. The lack of a low cost and effective mechanism to prevent the pulverization of Si electrodes during the lithiation/delithiation process has been a major barrier in the mass production of Si anodes. Naturally abundant gum arabic (GA), composed of polysaccharides and glycoproteins, is applied as a dual-function binder to address this dilemma. Firstly, the hydroxyl groups of the polysaccharide in GA are crucial in ensuring strong binding to Si. Secondly, similar to the function of fiber in fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC), the long chain glycoproteins provide further mechanical tolerance to dramatic volume expansion by Si nanoparticles. The resultant Si anodes present an outstanding capacity of ca. 2000 mAh/g at a 1 C rate and 1000 mAh/g at 2 C rate, respectively, throughout 500 cycles. Excellent long-term stability is demonstrated by the maintenance of 1000 mAh/g specific capacity at 1 C rate for over 1000 cycles. This low cost, naturally abundant and environmentally benign polymer is a promising binder for LIBs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The hierarchical Ag NPs with a bimodal size distribution were auto-decorated on the surface of rice-like N-TiO 2  (named h-Ag/N-TiO 2 ) by semiconductor-metal double excitation process under solar light irradiation. The photoinduced growth process of self-assembled h-Ag/N-TiO 2  and its photocatalytic mechanism of photo-splitting ethanol into hydrogen have been discussed in detail. The synthesized h-Ag/N-TiO 2  as a plasmonic photocatalyst for photo-splitting ethanol exhibited a higher hydrogen production rate (4.7\u00a0mmol\u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0g \u22121 ) than Ag NPs universally loaded N-TiO 2  (3.4\u00a0mmol\u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0g \u22121 ) and pure N-TiO 2  (2.1\u00a0mmol\u00a0h \u22121 \u00a0g \u22121 ). This work presents a reversed photo-induced synthesis strategy to design a stable Ag-TiO 2  plasmonic photocatalyst with high photocatalytic efficiency under solar light. A better understanding of this solar light induced self-assembled process for Ag-TiO 2  is crucial in developing metal-semiconductor system for solar energy materials.",

The self-aggregate peony-like 3D Cu2(OH)PO4 flowers with the diameter size up to 10\u201320 \u03bcm were composed of hundreds of anisotropic cross-linking petals with several hundred nanometers wide and 110\u2013170 nm thick. After the morphology and structure of these Cu2(OH)PO4 flowers were characterized by transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope, the possible growth process of Cu2(OH)PO4 flowers was proposed. The relationship between the shape of Cu2(OH)PO4 nanostructure and photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation was also investigated. The results indicated that a thin petal and high content of Cu2(OH)PO4 flowers film on the copper substrate proved more convenient for extending their absorption edge to the visible light region, as well as giving a better photocatalytic performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In recent years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop new photocatalyst with wide spectrum response for H 2  generation from water or aqueous solution. In this work, CdS nanoparticles (NPs) have been immobilized on hydrogenated three-dimensional (3D) branched TiO 2  nanorod arrays, resulting in a highly efficient photocatalyst, i.e, CdS/H-3D-TiO 2 . In addition, electrochemical reduction of H +  ion is identified as a limiting step in the photocatalytic generation of H 2  at this catalyst, while here a Pt wired photocatalysis system (CdS/H-3D-TiO 2 /Pt-wire) is designed to overcome this barrier. Without the application of potential bias, visible light photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of CdS/H-3D-TiO 2 /Pt-wire is 18.42\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0cm \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 , which is 11.2 times that of CdS/H-3D-TiO 2  without Pt (1.64\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0cm \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121 ). The Pt wire acts as an electron super highway between the FTO substrate and H +  ions to evacuate the generated electrons to H +  ions and catalyze the reduction reaction and consequently generate H 2  gas. This work successfully offers a novel direction for dramatic improvement in H 2  generation efficiency in photocatalysis field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A CdS sensitized hydrogenated TiO 2  nanorod arrays (CdS@HTNRs) film was developed for the selective visible-light-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing of Cu 2+  ion. The sensitive determination was based on extremely high PEC activity of the as-prepared CdS@HTNRs, i.e, the photocurrent density of the as-prepared CdS@HTNRs electrode could reach up to 10.1\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122 , which was 33.7 times higher than that of the pure HTNRs film. Dramatic photocurrent quenching was observed upon immersion of the CdS@HTNRs electrode into Cu 2+  solution. The analytical principle is based on significant quenching of photocurrent, i.e, the formation of CuS and subsequent Cu  x  S ( x \u202f=\u202f1, 2) produced on the electrode surface under illumination reduces the absorption of light and boosts the electron-hole recombination, respectively. Due to the large photocurrent density of the as-prepared CdS@HTNRs and the high selectivity of chemical recognition reaction between CdS and Cu 2+ , the photocurrent quenching of Cu x S, is proposed to be sensitive and selective in detecting Cu 2+  ion. The linear detection range could be 0.8\u202fnM to 82.0\u202f\u03bcM with the detection limit of 0.3\u202fnM via controlling recognition reaction time to be 7\u202fmin. The sensor was also successfully applied in the detecting Cu 2+  ion in real samples such as tap water, lake water and urine.",

Integrating a large area of intercontact g-C 3 N 4 /CdS heterojunction with an intimate connection between the photocatalysts and the substrate, the separation and migration of the photogenerated carriers by g-C 3 N 4  and CdS are significantly improved, and the internal resistance of the photoanode is effectively reduced. The optimal g-C 3 N 4 /CdS photoanode exhibits an excellent visible light photocurrent density of 5.4\u202fmA\u202fcm -2 \u202fat 0.0\u202fV bias ( vs.  Ag/AgCl) and the photoelectrochemical H 2  production rate reaches 81.1\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fh -1 \u202fcm -2 . Moreover, the stability of this interlocking g-C 3 N 4 /CdS photoanode not only reflects in a 9-hour long time recycling photoelectrochemical H 2  production test, but also in an outstanding steady structure which even be stabilized in an ultrasonic treatment. The present study provides a practical and convenient technique to develop such an earth abound and low-cost CdS/C 3 N 4  photoanode which can be used for high efficiency and stable photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.",

Over a 25-h long time irradiation, the total photocatalytic hydrogen production of hydrogenated CdS NRAs is almost 2.0 times higher than that of un-hydrogenated CdS NRAs. Moreover, the average hydrogen production rate of CdS NRAs-H 2  can steadily maintain at 23.75\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0cm \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121  with 102% of retention rate after 5 reaction cycles, while they are only 6.13\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0cm \u22122 \u00a0h \u22121  with 30% of retention rate for un-hydrogenated common CdS NRAs.

        "abstract": "Abstract   High performance, low cost and sustainable photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen is a promising energy supply alternative for modern society to resolve the depletion crisis of fossil fuel. The design of multi-heterojunction visible-light photocatalysts combined with electrochemical means is considered one of the most attractive options in recent years. In this work, a photoanode composed of top-opened ZnO/CdS/PbS nanotube arrays (ZnO/CdS/PbS ONTs) with multi-heterojunctions was synthesized via a three-step process, i.e. hydrothermal treatment, chemical bath deposition and successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR). This as-prepared photoanode exhibited remarkable photoelectrochemical activity under visible light irradiation. The photocurrent density and photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution efficiency of the optimized ZnO/CdS/PbS ONTs reached up to 14.2\u202fmA\u202fcm \u22122  and 5.5\u202fmL\u202fcm \u22122 \u202fh \u22121  at 0.0\u202fV  vs.  Ag/AgCl, respectively. The efficiency was 3.1 times that of top-closed ZnO/CdS nanotubes (1.8\u202fmL\u202fcm \u22122 \u202fh \u22121 ). The experimental results suggest that the high photoelectrochemical activity can be ascribed to the inherent advantages of the structural and successive energy level relays design: on the one hand, the top-opened nanotube structure significantly enlarges surface area of the nanostructure, which facilitates efficient light absorption and rapid mass transport; on the other hand, the well-matched band energy edge of the multi-heterojunction interfaces literally build efficient electron highways to deliver electrons to reaction sites and reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.",

For the first time, we synthesize SnO2/BiOBr heterojunction photocatalysts using a one-step hydrothermal method. Systematic material characterizations suggest that the photocatalysts consist of irregular BiOBr nanosheets with the length about 200 nm and width about 150 nm, and SnO2 nanoparticles are anchored uniformly onto the nanosheets. Most importantly, electrochemical characterization including transient photocurrent profiles and electrochemical impedance spectra suggest that SnO2/BiOBr heterojunctions are created, which facilitates the charge separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. As such, SnO2/BiOBr photocatalysts exhibit remarkable photocatalytic activities in terms of degrading a series of organic pollutants. Radical trapping experiments and ESR spectra suggest that superoxide radicals (\u2022O2-) and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) are primary medium species running through photocatalytic degradation process, and enhanced photocatalytic performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Selective detection of organic compounds in water body is both desirable and challenging for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) sensors. In this work, tunable oxidation capability is designed and achieved by modifying titanium dioxide nanorod arrays (TiO 2 ) photoelectrodes with nano-sized plasmonic gold (Au) particle deposition and subsequent hydrogenation treatment ( i.e.  Au@H-TiO 2 ). The effective incorporation of Au nanoparticles onto the TiO 2  nanorods induces a plasmonic effect and extends light absorption from ultraviolet (UV) to the visible light range while the hydrogenation process dramatically improves PEC oxidation activity. Under visible light, the Au@H-TiO 2  electrode exhibits selective detection capability to labile organic compounds. This excellent selectivity is demonstrated by a wide linear relationship between photocurrent and the concentration of different types of sugars, including glucose, fructose, sucrose and lactose in the presence of various concentrations of the aromatic compound potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP). Furthermore, the modified electrode can also undiscriminately detect all kinds of organic compounds in a rapid manner under UV irradiation due to the strong oxidation capability. Such a unique feature of the tunable oxidation capability bestows the Au@H-TiO 2  photoelectrodes a new generation of the PEC sensors for selective and collective degradation of organic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Well dispersed Bi nanostructures were synthesized on TiO 2  nanotube arrays (TNAs) via a facile electrochemical\u00a0deposition route at room temperature, employing Bi(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b75H 2 O as the reactant with the assistance of complexing agent and surfactant. The structures of the as-prepared product were characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectrometer. The influence of preparation conditions on Bi electrodeposition were investigated systematically. The results showed that the concentration of surfactant, the deposition voltage and pH value could markedly affect the morphology of Bi-TNAs. The prepared Bi-TNAs have been used to fabricate BiOI and Bi 2 O 3  semiconductors supported on TNAs, which exhibited high visible-light photocatalytic efficiency for acid orange II degradation. This study predicates a promising path to synthesizing\u00a0Bi-based photocatalysts on TNAs.",

        "abstract": "Because of its large bandgap, TiO2 can function only under UV light. TiO2 surface modification with noble metal nanoparticles can extend the light absorption from UV to visible light region and enhance the photocatalytic quantum yield. In this work, TiO2 nanorods (Cu/TiO2) modified by copper nanoparticles were prepared by a one-step solvothermal method at low cost. The resultant Cu/TiO2 nanorods show excellent synergistic effect in the oxidation of methylene blue (MB) and the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under solar light irradiation. Mechanistic investigation suggests that the Cr(VI) species could effectively scavenge the electrons from MB in the presence of the as-prepared photocatalyst, leading to the simultaneous removal of both pollutants. Being economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and highly efficient, the proposed photocatalyst holds promise for technologies involving simultaneous organic degradation and heavy metal removal in wastewater treatment.",

The platinum-doped TiO(2) sol-gels were also synthesized by adding K(2)PtCl(6) into the titanium hydrate sols. The hydrophobic montmorillonite clay, treated with organic cationic surfactant, i.e., hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, was used as a template to prepare TiO(2) pillared photocatalyst with the above sols. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) were employed to characterize the resulting photocatalysts. The adsorption performance and photoactivity of prepared pillared clays were studied by using methyl orange as a model organic pollutant. The preliminary results indicated that the hydrophobic TiO(2) pillared clay prepared with acetic acid as the acid hydrolysis catalysts possessed higher photocatalytic activity than that with hydrochloric acid. Due to the excellent sedimentation property of the clay, the resulting pillared photocatalyst is easily recovered and reused in the postrun treatment. Also the doping of platinum into the hydrophobic photocatalyst can increase the photocatalytic activity significantly.",

In this work, TiO2/BDD heterojunction electrodes were prepared by dip-coating TiO2 nanoparticles onto BDD electrodes. XRD patterns of these electrodes suggest that the mixed-phase TiO2/BDD heterojunction electrode with anatase and rutile can be obtained at 700 C, named as mixed-phase TiO2/BDD electrode. However, the TiO2/BDD heterojunction electrode prepared at 450 C has only anatase phase TiO2, named as pure-anatase TiO2/BDD electrode. SEM images indicate that TiO2 nanoparticles with ca. 20 nm were both immobilized continuously and uniformly onto the BDD electrode whether at 700 C or 450 C. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of mixed-phase TiO2/BDD electrode is 3-fold of that obtained at pure-anatase TiO2/BDD electrode, indicating that mixed-phase TiO2/BDD electrode is more effective to use to degrade and/or detect the organic compounds. Comparing with the TiO2/ITO electrode, the TiO2/BDD electrode presents an excellent chemical stability. The detection of glucose and KHP in the solution indicates that the steady-state net photocurrent in the range of concentration monitored presents superiorly linear relationship to the concentration of glucose and KHP. Therefore, the mixed-phase TiO2/BDD electrode may be used as a high effective sensing material for the detection of organic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and boron-doped diamond (BDD) are two of the most popular functional materials in recent years. In this work, TiO(2) nanoparticles were immobilized onto the BDD electrodes by a dip-coating technique. Continuous and uniform mixed-phase (anatase and rutile) and pure-anatase TiO(2)/BDD electrodes were obtained after calcination processes at 700 and 450 degrees C, respectively. The particle sizes of both types of TiO(2) film range from 20 to 30 nm. In comparison with a TiO(2)/indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, the TiO(2)/BDD electrode demonstrates a higher photoelectrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of organic compounds, such as glucose and potassium hydrogen phthalate. Among all the tested TiO(2) electrodes, the mixed-phase TiO(2)/BDD electrode demonstrated the highest photoelectrocatalytic activity, which can be attributed to the formation of the p-n heterojunction between TiO(2) and BDD. The electrode was subsequently used to detect a wide spectrum of organic compounds in aqueous solution using a steady-state current method. An excellent linear relationship between the steady-state photocurrents and equivalent organic concentrations was attained. The steady-state oxidation photocurrents of the mixed-phase TiO(2)/BDD electrode were insensitive to pH in the range of pH 2-10. Furthermore, the electrodes exhibited excellent robustness under strong acidic conditions that the TiO(2)/ITO electrodes cannot stand. These characteristics bestow the mixed-phase TiO(2)/BDD electrode to be a versatile material for the sensing of organic compounds.",

        "abstract": "A TiO2/BDD heterojunction photoanode, utilizing the inherent properties of nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) and boron-doped diamond (BDD), was prepared and used to determine chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewaters. The TiO2 nanoparticles were dip-coated on a BDD substrate and subject to calcination processes. A uniform, continuous and robust mixed-phase (anatase and rutile) TiO2/BDD heterojunction electrode was obtained. The TiO2/BDD heterojunction electrode was evaluated using a series of materials characterisation, electrical and electrochemical techniques. The preliminary results suggest the elevated photoelectrocatalytic activity over the oxidation of organic compounds stemmed from the formation of the p-n junction of the TiO2/BDD electrode. The TiO2/BDD electrode has an excellent resistance towards strong acid due to the use of BDD substrate, which is an added advantage for practical application. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the TiO2/BDD electrode is capable of indiscriminately oxidizing a wide spectrum of organic compounds in a photoelectrochemical thin-layer cell. This bestows the photoelectrochemical system with the ability to measure the COD of synthetic and real samples in a fast, sensitive, reproducible and accurate fashion. In particular, a typical analysis time of 5 minutes, a practical detection limit of 0.12 mg L -1 COD, a RSD% value of 1.5% and a linear range of 0-300 mg L -1 were achieved. The TiO2/BDD electrode can be an ideal sensor for online and in situ monitoring of organic pollutants in wastewaters. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",

        "abstract": "With closing water loop through purified recycled water, wastewater becomes a part of source water, requiring reliable wastewater quality monitoring system (WQMS) to manage wastewater source and mitigate potential health risks. However, the development of reliable WQMS is fatally constrained by severe contamination and biofouling of sensors due to the hostile analytical environment of wastewaters, especially raw sewages, that challenges the limit of existing sensing technologies. In this work, we report a technological solution to enable the development of WQMS for real-time abnormal event detection with high reliability and practicality. A vectored high flow hydrodynamic self-cleaning approach and a dual-sensor self-diagnostic concept are adopted for WQMS to effectively encounter vital sensor failing issues caused by contamination and biofouling and ensure the integrity of sensing data. The performance of the WQMS has been evaluated over a 3-year trial period at different sewage catchment sites across three Australian states. It has demonstrated that the developed WQMS is capable of continuously operating in raw sewage for a prolonged period up to 24 months without maintenance and failure, signifying the high reliability and practicality. The demonstrated WQMS capability to reliably acquire real-time wastewater quality information leaps forward the development of effective wastewater source management system. The reported self-cleaning and self-diagnostic concepts should be applicable to other online water quality monitoring systems, opening a new way to encounter the common reliability and stability issues caused by sensor contamination and biofouling.",

This work reported a new gaseous ammonia sensing principle and developed a gas-permeable membrane-based conductivity probe (GPMCP) to obtain critical information that enables insightful understanding of agriculture ammonia volatilization process. The analytical principle based on real-time measurement of the rate of conductivity increment in the receiving solution to achieve real-time,  in-situ  gaseous ammonia concentration and volatilization flux in a reliable and continuous fashion. It is also capable of obtaining an average ammonia volatilization flux and amount over a deployment period. The delicate design of GPMCP and developed precalibration strategy in this study bestows this technique a direct method that can effectively avoid ongoing calibration. Field deployments results showed that GPMCP had significant advantages on presenting continuous detailed ammonia volatilization information. The reported GPMCP can be an effective tool to monitor agricultural ammonia volatilization process.",

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) has drawn intense research interest over the past decade, contributing to remarkable progress in its relevant applications. The chemical production of GO, however, is challenged by destructive and slowly propagating oxidation, especially for large flake graphite. Herein, we report a simple but effective method to produce well-oxidized and less defective GO by chemically oxidizing commercially available expandable graphite at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). Compared to natural graphite with similar flake sizes, expandable graphite afforded faster complete oxidation under the same oxidizing conditions. In addition, chemical oxidation at room temperature, relative to that at higher temperatures (35 and 45 \u00b0C), resulted in a reduced defect concentration in GO. Furthermore, the GO derived from the oxidation of expandable graphite at room temperature exhibited superior electrical conductivity after mild thermal treatment at 150 \u00b0C. Considering the energy-saving in both GO synthesis and reduction, the low temperature GO conversion process can be easily integrated into many other electroconductive applications. As a proof of concept, we achieved a good LiFePO4 (without carbon-coating) cathode formulation with our GO, which contributed as a 2D binder (before annealing), and obtained a conductive cathode with improved capacity and high rate performance after mild thermal annealing at 150 \u00b0C.",

TiNR arrays grown on both electrodes had the same length (3 \u03bcm). In comparison with the TiNR/FTO electrode, the TiNR/BDD electrode demonstrated a higher photoelectrocatalytic activity for the degradation of water and organic compounds, which is mostly attributed to the formation of a p-n heterojunction between the TiNR arrays and BDD at high potential, apart from the density of TiNR. A linear relationship between the photoelectrocatalytic current and the organic concentration can be observed on both electrodes. However, the linear range between net photoelectrocatalytic current values and organic compound concentrations for the TiNR/BDD electrode are much greater than those for the TiNR/FTO electrode, which makes the TiNR/BDD electrode a versatile material for the photocatalytic degradation and sensing of organic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Ciprofloxacin, as a second generation of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, has been proved to cause environmental harm and exhibits toxic effects on the wastewater and surface water even at low concentrations due to their continuous input and persistence. Despite tremendous efforts, developing ciprofloxacin detection method with accuracy and sensitivity at low-cost remains a great challenge. Herein, graphitic carbon nitride/BiOCl composite (g-CN/BiOCl) has been designed for a facile and sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) monitoring platform of ciprofloxacin at first time. BiOCl can be modified with the g-CN nanosheets which are obtained via solvothermal process at low-temperature conditions. The use of g-CN is shown to strongly enhance the PEC response of BiOCl due to the formation of heterojunctions. The photocurrent generated at the g-CN/BiOCl-modified ITO (with 13wt%g-CN content) is much higher and more stable than that of a BiOCl-modified ITO. Based on these findings, the g-CN/BiOCl-modified ITO was used to design a PEC assay for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, the limit of detection of the ciprofloxacin PEC sensor has been significantly lowered to 0.2ngmL(-1). In addition, the PEC sensor can detect ciprofloxacin in the wide range of 0.5-1840ngmL(-1). ",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Ferric oxide has demonstrated as a promising anode candidate for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to large charge storage capacity, but its high cost, low Coulombic efficiency, and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase remain to be a technical challenge. Here, we report a flexible interleaved hybrid in which Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles were encapsulated by graphene oxide layers (Fe 2 O 3 /GO) using facile freeze-drying approach as anode for LIBs. Within this flexible interleaved structure, GO layers act as flexible but mechanically strong buffer to accommodate volume expansion and reduce associated stress in Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles, thereby maintaining mechanical integrity and increasing the cycling life of batteries. With the synergistic effects from Fe 2 O 3  and GO, this hybrid not only promotes fast mass transfer and shortens the diffusion path of the Li ions but also forms a stable solid electrolyte interface, contributing improved Coulombic efficiency in the first few cycles. The Fe 2 O 3 /GO hybrid as anode for LIBs exhibited a reversible specific capacity of ca. 890\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  after 50 cycles at 1\u00a0C (1005\u00a0mA\u00a0g \u22121 ) and 405\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  after 1000 cycles at 10\u00a0C rate. Furthermore, a full-cell battery with a LiFePO 4  cathode also showed high Coulombic efficiency and good capacity retention capability. Mechanical properties and impedance spectroscopy tests were performed to confirm the mechanism in superior rate and electrochemical stability. The conclusions are considered to be very useful for design of Li batteries with improved mechanical performance.",

        "abstract": "Conventional electrode manufacturing processes for lithium ion batteries involve the use of toxic organic solvents (such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, NMP). A low cost and green preparation process for high performance electrodes for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is important to address simultaneously the environmental and health risks of production processes and the shortage of lithium metal. Herein, gum arabic (GA), which is a non-toxic biodegradable biopolymer, is used as a water soluble binder to design a water-based electrode preparation process to fabricate \u03b1-Fe2O3 electrodes (i.e., \u03b1-Fe2O3@GA electrode). The \u03b1-Fe2O3@GA electrode demonstrates better mechanical properties and binding capability than that of the \u03b1-Fe2O3 electrode with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as the binder (\u03b1-Fe2O3@PVDF electrode). Due to these merits, a higher rate and cycling performance of the \u03b1-Fe2O3@GA electrode are achieved compared with the \u03b1-Fe2O3@PVDF electrode when both electrodes are used for SIBsu0027 application. The \u03b1-Fe2O3@GA electrode demonstrates high initial discharge and charge capacities of 2437 and 1102 mA h g\u22121 at the current density of 0.2 A g\u22121. The \u03b1-Fe2O3@GA electrode maintains a high reversible discharge capacity of 492 mA h g\u22121 at the current density of 5 A g\u22121 after 500 cycles with a fading rate of 0.08% per cycle after the first cycle, which indicates a superior cycling performance. The outstanding performance of the resultant SIBs suggests that the green fabrication process of the \u03b1-Fe2O3@GA electrode would play a critical role in the future battery industry.",

        "abstract": "Graphene\u2010based materials have been widely studied to overcome the hurdles of Li\u2013S batteries, but suffer from low adsorptivity to polar polysulfide species, slow mass transport of Li+ ions, and severe irreversible agglomeration. Herein, via a one\u2010step scalable calcination process, a holey Fe, N codoped graphene (HFeNG) is successfully synthesized to address these problems. Diverging by the holey structures, the Fe atoms are anchored by four N atoms (Fe\u2013N4 moiety) or two N atoms (Fe\u2013N2 moiety) localized on the graphene sheets and edge of holes, respectively, which is confirmed by X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The unique holey structures not only promote the mass transport of lithium ions, but also prohibit the transportation of polysulfides across these additional channels via strong adsorption forces of Fe\u2013N2 moiety at the edges. The as\u2010obtained HFeNG delivers a high rate capacity of 810 mAh g\u22121 at 5 C and a stable cycling performance with the capacity decay of 0.083% per cycle at 0.5 C. The concept of holey structure and introduction of polar moieties could be extended to other carbon and 2D nanostructures for energy storage and conversion devices such as supercapacitors, alkali\u2010ion batteries, metal\u2013air batteries, and metal\u2013halogen batteries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The development of nonprecious metal catalysts with highly efficient and durable activities is of great importance for high performances of zinc\u2013air batteries. Herein, the N-doped graphene wrapped Fe 3 C/Fe 2 O 3  heterostructure has been designed as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst for zinc\u2013air batteries. In the synthesis process of the catalyst, graphene oxide (GO) can assemble with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) and FeOOH nanorods by the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking and hydrogen bonds, respectively. The assembly of GO, g-C 3 N 4  and FeOOH nanorods results in nanostructure of carbon layers coated iron species and leads to outstanding durability in both alkaline and acidic media. The synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and Fe 3 C/Fe 2 O 3  heterostructure allows the catalyst (Fe 3 C/Fe 2 O 3 @NGNs) to display high oxygen reduction and evolution reaction activities. The liquid zinc\u2013air battery assembled with the catalyst presented a remarkable peak power density (139.8\u202fmW\u202fcm \u22122 ), large specific capacity (722 mAh g \u22121 ) and excellent charging\u2013discharging cycling performance. The quasi-solid-state zinc\u2013air battery with the catalyst exhibited an impressive open-circuit voltage and a peak power density. Therefore, the Fe 3 C/Fe 2 O 3 @NGNs catalyst is expected to have a bright future for practical applications in energy conversion devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The relation between the microstructure and the magnetic properties of Fe 2 P-type (Mn,Fe) 2 (P,Si,B) based materials has been systematically investigated by changing the annealing temperature and time. X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy measurements show that the alloys contain the main Fe 2 P-type phase and two impurity phases of (Fe,Mn) 5 Si 3 -type and Fe 2 MnSi-type. Boron appears to facilitate the formation of the Fe 2 P-type phase during the arc-melting progress. Upon increasing the annealing temperatures from 1123 to 1423\u00a0K, the Curie temperature ( T  C ) decreases from 302.0 to 270.5\u00a0K in the Mn 1.15 Fe 0.85 P 0.55 Si 0.45  alloys and the magnetic-entropy change (\u0394 S  M ) increases linearly with annealing temperature. For the Mn 1.15 Fe 0.85 P 0.52 Si 0.45 B 0.03  alloys annealed at 1423\u00a0K for different times,  T   C   decreases from 263.8 and 232.8\u00a0K with increasing annealing time and \u0394 S  M  reaches a maximum value after annealing for 48\u00a0h. The differences in the annealing temperature and time influence the Si content in the Fe 2 P-type phase of the alloys and determine  T   C  , the thermal hysteresis and the magneto-elastic transition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as a promising cost-effective alternative for grid energy storage for renewable energy sources such as wind- and solar power. In this work, a bismuth nano-spheres and porous carbon composite (Bi-NS@C) is developed via an oleate-oriented dual-phase interfacial reaction and a molten salt calcination process. Materials characterizations suggest that the Bi-NS with a size of 20\u201330\u00a0nm are uniformly distributed in the sponge-like porous carbon network. Such a structure could enable a conductive network, prevent particle aggregation, shorten the ions transportation pathways, accommodate volume change and prevent the collapse of the electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 106\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  after even 1000 cycles at 0.2\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 . Even at 2\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 , the specific capacity of the electrode can still retain at \u223c110\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121 . The remarkable electrochemical performance of the Bi-NS@C composite suggests that the as-prepared nanocomposite can simultaneously enhance the Na +  ion conductivity and electronic conductivity in the charge/discharge processes, which offer guidance in anode materials design and synthesis in SIBs.",

        "abstract": "Aluminum (Al) is one of the most attractive anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity, excellent conductivity, abundance, and especially low cost. However, the large volume expansion, originating from the uneven alloying/dealloying reactions in the charge/discharge process, causes structural stress and electrode pulverization, which has long hindered its practical application, especially when assembled with a high-areal-density cathode. Here, an inactive (Cu) and active (Al) co-deposition strategy is reported to homogeneously distribute the alloying sites and disperse the stress of volume expansion, which is beneficial to obtain the structural stability of the Al anode. Owing to the homogeneous reaction and uniform distribution of stress during the charge/discharge process, the assembled full battery (LiFePO cathode with a high areal density of \u22487.4 mg cm ) with the Cu-Al@Al anode, achieves a high capacity retention of \u224888% over 200 cycles, suggesting the feasibility of the interfacial design to optimize the structural stability of alloying metal anodes for high-performance LIBs.",

As a result of the ultrahigh specific area (2551.06 m(2) g(-1)), high porosity (1.75 cm(3) g(-1)), high conductivity (1170 S m(-1)), and heteroatoms doping of N-LSC, the resultant Li-S, Li-Se, and Li-I2 batteries with the N-LSC-900 membrane deliver outstanding electrochemical performance stability in all cases, i.e., high reversible capacities of 623.6 mA h g(-1) at 1675 mA g(-1) after 500 cycles, 350 mA h g(-1) at 1356 mA g(-1) after 1000 cycles, and 150 mA h g(-1) at 10550 mA g(-1) after 5000 cycles, respectively.

The better cycling performance and high discharge capacity can be attributed to the strong interactions between ZnO and S  x   2\u2212  species, which is verified by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation result that the ZnO exhibits a higher adsorption energy for Li 2 S 8  than the Ni(OH) 2 .",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are extraordinarily attractive for use in energy storage devices because of their unique electronic and mechanical properties. However, the synthesis of ultrathin 2D nanomaterials is still a great challenge. In this paper, a top-down strategy using a high-pressure hydrogen surface treatment and controlled etching to reduce the thickness of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) nanoplates is proposed. As a result, the ultrathin Fe2O3 hexagonal nanoflakes with a thickness of approximately 4 nm are successfully synthesized. When employed as an anode material in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, it delivers a super-high reversible capacity of approximately 1043 mA h g\u22121 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g\u22121 and approximately 578 mA h g\u22121 after 500 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g\u22121. It is also the best performing Fe2O3 electrode among the reported Fe2O3 anodes in the literature. Such excellent cycling performances can be attributed to the ultrathin structure which is able to enhance the mass transport of the lithium ion, short electron transport length as well as tolerance of large volume changes. This work provides a guidance to the synthesis of ultra-thin 2D oxide nanomaterials for energy storage.",

        "abstract": "Graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet (i.e., g-CN) is identified as a suitable graphene analogue due to its high theoretical capacity, wider and vacant structure, and easy synthesis method. Currently, g-CN nanosheet has limited application in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) which is mainly due to the lack of effective intercalation/deintercalation reaction sites, the high binding energy of the Li to the nanosheet, and insufficient conductivity and stability. Density functional theory calculation predicts that the edges of g-CN fibre have a suitable adsorption energy and bestow a balanced adsorption force and desorption freedom to Li. In order to verify this prediction, g-CN nanofibre is synthesized with the edges and pores, as well as higher pyridinic nitrogen content, using a simple polymerization/polycondensation method. The as-prepared g-CN fibre delivers a remarkable specific capacity of 181.7 mAh g, as well as extraordinary stability and power density. At a high rate of 10C, the g-CN fibre still has a specific capacity of 138.6 mAh g even after 5000 cycles, being the best-performing g-CN electrode so far in literature. This work is exemplary in combining theoretical computing and experimental techniques in designing the next generation of electroactive materials for LIBs.",

        "abstract": "The effects of climate change are just beginning to be felt, and as such, society must work towards strategies of reducing humanity\u2019s impact on the environment. Due to the fact that energy production is one of the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, it is obvious that more environmentally friendly sources of power are required. Technologies such as solar and wind power are constantly being improved through research; however, as these technologies are often sporadic in their power generation, efforts must be made to establish ways to store this sustainable energy when conditions for generation are not ideal. Battery storage is one possible supplement to these renewable energy technologies; however, as current Li-ion technology is reaching its theoretical capacity, new battery technology must be investigated. Lithium\u2013sulphur (Li\u2013S) batteries are receiving much attention as a potential replacement for Li-ion batteries due to their superior capacity, and also their abundant and environmentally benign active materials. In the spirit of environmental harm minimization, efforts have been made to use sustainable carbonaceous materials for applications as carbon\u2013sulphur (C\u2013S) composite cathodes, carbon interlayers, and carbon-modified separators. This work reports on the various applications of carbonaceous materials applied to Li\u2013S batteries, and provides perspectives for the future development of Li\u2013S batteries with the aim of preparing a high energy density, environmentally friendly, and sustainable sulphur-based cathode with long cycle life.",

Due to the tunability of their composition and the structural versatility, diverse electrochemical behaviors for multi-electron reactions, fast-ion diffusion, and small volume change of electrodes could be achieved upon charging and discharging. Because of these superiorities, MOPs are considered as effective substitutes for future advanced energy storage systems. Here, we summarize the recent progress in pristine MOPs as electrode candidates for rechargeable lithium and sodium ion batteries. The working mechanisms and strategies for enhancing the electrochemical performance in related advanced electrochemical energy storage (EES) applications are also highlighted in this review.",

        "abstract": "Lithium metal is among the most promising anode materials for high-energy batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrochemical potential. However, dendrite formation is a major challenge which can result in fire and explosion of batteries. Herein, we report on hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) as an electrolyte additive that can suppress the growth of lithium dendrites by lithiophobic repulsion mechanisms. During the lithium plating process, cationic surfactant molecules can aggregate around protuberances via electrostatic attraction, forming a non-polar lithiophobic protective outer layer which drives the deposition of lithium ions to adjacent regions to produce the dendrite-free uniform Li deposits. Thus excellent cycle of 300 h at 1.0 mA cm-2 and rate performance up to 4 mA cm-2 are available safely, in symmetric Li|Li cells. In particular, significantly enhanced cycle and rate performance were achieved when the electrolyte with CTAC additives was used in lithium-sulfur and Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells. The effect of carbon-chains, anions of surfactant and electrostatic repulsion on the deposition of lithium anode are reported. This work advances research in inhibiting Li dendrite growth with a new electrolyte additive based on cationic surfactants.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we have achieved all-climate high-rate performance of sodium ion batteries by utilizing electrode materials with Na Super Ionic Conductor (NASICON) crystalline structure. A designed NASICON-structured carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP@C) nanocomposite exhibits an excellent performance at high rates in a wide temperature range (i.e., from \u221220 to 55 \u00b0C). Even at a low temperature of \u221220 \u00b0C, the NVP@C cathode can still maintain a discharge capacity of 91.3 mA h g\u22121 or 85.2% of the room performance at 10C, and secure an average output voltage of 2.86 V (vs. Na+/Na). These excellent wide-temperature accomplishments can be ascribed to fast three-dimensional Na+ hopping transportation mechanism in the NASICON structure. The finding in this work offers a promising strategy to address the long-standing inherent wide-temperature issues of rechargeable batteries and extends the potential application of sodium ion batteries.",

Therefore, the recyclability and sustainability of a battery should be considered at the design stage by using naturally abundant resources and recyclable battery technology. Herein, we design a fully recyclable rechargeable sodium ion battery with bipolar electrode structure using NaV(PO) as an electrode material and aluminum foil as the shared current collector. Such a design allows exceptional sodium ion battery performance in terms of high-power correspondence and long-term stability and enables the recycling of \u223c100% NaV(PO) and \u223c99.1% elemental aluminum without the release of toxic wastes, resulting in a solid-component recycling efficiency of\u2009>98.0%. The successful incorporation of sustainability into battery design suggests that closed-loop recycling and the reutilization of battery materials can be achieved in next-generation energy storage technologies.",

Here, polypyrrole-encapsulated amorphous Bi2S3 hollow spheres are prepared by the sulfuration of Bi\u2013glycol spheres with a polypyrrole (PPy) coating. Benefiting from the unique hollow structure (Kirkendall effect) and the excellent conductivity and flexibility of the PPy coating, this material can be applied in both SIBs and Li\u2013S batteries. For SIBs, the unconductive amorphous Bi2S3 is electrochemically reduced to conductive metallic Bi, leading to a Bi\u2013PPy core\u2013shell structure. The resulting Bi acts as the main active material while the PPy coating accommodates the volume variation of Bi during sodiation/desodiation. For Li\u2013S batteries, the outer double layer structure effectively prevents the dissolution and \u201cshuttle effect\u201d of polysulfides by physically containing and chemically adsorbing polysulfides, and tolerates the volume expansion of sulfur. Meanwhile, the residual polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the preparation process is chemically bonded with sulfur and exhibits the electrochemical properties, and results in additional discharging/charging capacity. Thus, this multifunctional electrode shows excellent rate capability and cycling life in SIBs and Li\u2013S batteries. This work provides new insight into the design of multifunctional electrodes.",

Unfortunately, the relationship between the dynamic mechanical response and microstructure evolution during lithiation and delithiation has not been well understood. We use molecular dynamic simulations to investigate lithiated amorphous silicon with a focus to the evolution of its microstructure, phase composition, and stress generation. The results show that the formation of LixSi alloy phase is via different mechanisms, depending on Li concentration. In these alloy phases, the increase in Li concentration results in reduction of modulus of elasticity and fracture strength but increase in ductility in tension. For a LixSi system with uniform Li distribution, volume change induced stress is well below the fracture strength in tension.",

In this work, deformation and failure mechanisms of electrochemically lithiated a-Si thin films were investigated using nanoindentation and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The cracking observed in the a-Si thin films after the initial lithiation\u2013delithiation cycle is associated with the tension stress developed when constrained by the substrates. The MD simulations provide an atomistic insight on the origin of plasticity and transition of fracture mechanisms with increasing lithium concentration in the electrode. Both experiment and the MD simulations indicate reduced strength, elastic modulus but increased ductility in the a-Si films after the full lithiation\u2013delithiation cycle, as a result of increased disorder in the microstructures. Also, the mapping of void nucleation and growth indicates different failure modes in pristine and delithiated a-Si.",

        "abstract": "Silicon (Si) is widely regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for Li ion battery (LIB) due to its highest known theoretical specific capacity (4200mAhg-1). Particularly, amorphous silicon has recently attracted great interest due to its robust lithiation behavior. Silicon electrodes are subjected to charge-discharge via an alloying-dealloying (lithiation-delithiation) mechanism. It enables the host silicon to store up to 4.4 lithium atoms per silicon atom, which gives more than ten times greater capacity compared with conventional graphite based electrodes. However, this enormous capacity comes with the expense of significant structural changes to the host silicon, which results in poor mechanical integrity. To address this issue, it is important to understand the transitional structural and mechanical properties of silicon during charge-discharge process. In this study, molecular dynamic simulation is employed to study the structure and mechanics of an amorphous silicon thin film (2.7nm) during a complete lithiation-delithiation cycle. The microstructure evolution during lithiation process is associated with the break of covalent amorphous structure into small clusters, when Li concentration exceeds ~Li0.25Si. Also, it is evident that Li induced stress is largely dependent on lithium concentration in silicon. Steep stress gradients were observed when the lithium content in the anode is very low (u003cLi0.25Si). Plastic flow and stress relaxation are dominant in higher Li concentrations. Furthermore, we show that the rate of si-si bond breaking is lithium concentration dependent. Also, the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) analysis revealed a defective amorphous structure in silicon film after a complete lithiation/delithiation cycle, which is attributed to breaking down of covalent silicon network and subsequent plastic flow. These results are useful in understanding lithiation-delithiation mechanisms of silicon and the favourable charge-discharge depths to avoid extreme stresses. Furthermore, these results are believed to be able to help improve the materials selection and design of next generation Li ion batteries.",

        "abstract": "Constructing high-areal-capacity anodes with high loading for Li-ion batteries is still an enormous challenge, due to the drastic volume change of large-capacity anode materials during cycling. The conventional PVDF binder system fails to withstand the degradation of high-loading electrodes. Therefore, advanced binders are urgently required. Herein, for the first time, the guar gum (GG) biopolymer has been exploited as a robust binder for micro-sized ZnCo2O4 (ZCO) anode materials. Because of its robust mechanical properties and strong interactions with ZCO, the cycling stability of the ZCO anode has been significantly improved with a capacity of 412\u00a0mA h g\u22121 after 600 cycles at 1200 mA g\u22121. More importantly, the ZCO can act as a \u201ccrosslinking agent\u201d to in situ form a robust network with GG, which efficiently maintains the electrode structure stability. Hence, a ZCO anode with an ultrahigh loading of 6.73 mg cm\u22122 can be achieved and deliver a high areal capacity of 5.6 mA h cm\u22122. Simultaneously, benefiting from the high tap density of micro-ZCO, the ZCO anode gives a high volumetric capacity of 1179 mA h cm\u22123. This study will make a significant contribution to accelerating the progress of designing high-areal-capacity anodes.",

This network binder was capable of effectively preventing polysulfides within the electrode from shuttling and, consequently, improved electrochemical performance. A remarkably high sulfur loading of 19.8 mg cm\u22122 and an ultrahigh areal capacity of 26.4 mA h cm\u22122 were achieved as a result of the robust mechanical properties of the network binder.

        "title": "A robust network binder with dual functions of Cu2+ ions as ionic crosslinking and chemical binding agents for highly stable Li\u2013S batteries",
        "abstract": "Binders play a crucial role in improving the electrochemical performance of batteries. The major challenges associated with the sulfur cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries are up to 76% volume change during cycling from sulfur (S) to lithium sulfide (Li2S) and the shuttle effect of polysulfide anions, resulting in poor cycling performance. Herein, we design a network binder through the crosslinking effect of sodium alginate (SA) and Cu2+ ions (named the SA\u2013Cu binder), in which Cu2+ ions work not only as an ionic crosslinking agent for a robust network structure, but also as a chemical binding agent for polysulfide anions. The robust network binder buffers large volume variations during cycling, while electropositive Cu2+ ions immobilize polysulfide anions through strong chemical binding. The resulting sulfur electrode delivers a capacity of 925 mA h g\u22121 after 100 cycles at 0.2C, which is much higher than those of sulfur electrodes with only SA and PVDF binders. Due to the robust mechanical properties of the SA\u2013Cu binder, a high-loading and crack-free sulfur electrode, i.e., a sulfur loading up to 8.05 mg cm\u22122, is also achieved and delivers a high areal capacity up to 9.5 mA h cm\u22122. This study paves a new way to immobilize polysulfide anions using the dual functions of Cu2+ ions as both the ionic crosslinking and chemical binding agents, which could open up a new direction for advanced binders for Li\u2013S batteries in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of electrode materials, electrolytes, and separators of energy-storage devices to address the fundamental needs of emerging technologies such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. However, binders, as an important component of energy-storage devices, are yet to receive similar attention. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been the dominant binder in the battery industry for decades despite several well-recognized drawbacks, i.e., limited binding strength due to the lack of chemical bonds with electroactive materials, insufficient mechanical properties, and low electronic and lithium-ion conductivities. The limited binding function cannot meet inherent demands of emerging electrode materials with high capacities such as silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes. To address these concerns, in this review we divide the binding between active materials and binders into two major mechanisms: mechanical interlocking and interfacial binding forces. We review existing and emerging binders, binding technology used in energy-storage devices (including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors), and state-of-the-art mechanical characterization and computational methods for binder research. Finally, we propose prospective next-generation binders for energy-storage devices from the molecular level to the macro level. Functional binders will play crucial roles in future high-performance energy-storage devices.",

Polybenzimidazole (PBI) polymers find use in firefighting equipment and astronaut spacesuits because of their high mechanical and thermal stability. Research team led by Shanqing Zhang from Griffith Universityin Australia and Zhoupeng Li from Zhejiang University in China now shows that PBI can make an attractive binder and separating agent for next-generation batteries. While the lithium-sulfur system has higher energy density than current lithium-ion batteries, polysulfides shuttling effect, the main technical barrier often degrades device efficiency. The team prepared a new electrode by mixing a sulfur-carbon composite with a modified form of PBI. They found battery durability improved by three to five times over typical polymer binders, while favorable binding interactions between PBI and polysulfides enhanced performance and cycling stability.",

A CeO2/CeN composite is obtained through simply annealing CeO2 nanowires under an ammonia atmosphere. Both theoretical and experimental analyses are used to study the interfacial interaction between CeO2 and CeN crystallites. Benefiting from the interface engineering, the as-prepared CeO2/CeN composite exhibits higher photo-thermocatalytic performance than pristine CeO2 for the removal of organic pollutants. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of intermediates and products are used to further confirm the synergetic effect and degradation mechanism of the photo-thermocatalysis reactions. The results of this work suggest that the synergetic effect of the photo-thermal reaction can be considered as one of the most efficient strategies for environmental pollution remediation.",

Density function theory (DFT) revealed that oxygen vacancies in Bi5O7Br could form an intermediate level, which could allow electron transfer to a new intermediate level, and finally move to the conduction band. The Bi/Bi5O7Br\u2013OV nanotubes demonstrate superior photocatalytic degradation of phenol, showing 3 times higher than that of pristine Bi5O7Br. The defects and Bi endow Bi5O7Br nanotubes with abundant active sites and improve the solar absorption. The increased and more dispersed charge density allow enhanced electronic conductivity and the separation of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, more \u00b7OH radicals are generated during photochemical reaction, which is beneficial in improving the photocatalytic performance. This work will play significant roles and create opportunities in modifying Bi-based materials for promoting photocatalysis.",

The response of NPP to the change of annual temperature and precipitation in the future is discussed. The main results are as follows:( 1) The spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation was quite different from different regions of Xinjiang,as a whole,the temperature in south Xinjiang was higher than that in north Xinjiang,higher in the basins ( valleys) than that in the mountainous areas. Precipitation in the mountainous areas was higher than that in the basins ( valleys) ,higher in the western and northern parts of Xinjiang than that in the eastern and southern parts; ( 2) Climate became warmer and wetter in recent 48 years in Xinjiang,and the annual mean temperature,precipitation had the discontinuity ascension in 1972 and 1978,but the change rate is different in every areas,in general,the climate warming rate was large in northern Xinjiang than in southern Xinjiang and mountain area,precipitation increasing rate was large in northern Xinjiang and mountain area than in southern Xinjiang. The annual mean temperature and precipitation has had quasi -4 a,9 a,11 a,16 a and 23 a cyclical changes; ( 3) By the comprehensive affected of temperature and precipitation,the NPP is large in Tianshan mountain area than in northern and southern Xinjiang,and the NPP is increasing by the rate of 0. 118 t/( hm2\u00b710 a) in recent 48 and there was mutability increase in 1978,and it exist 3 -4 a,6 -8 a,11 a and 16 a cyclical changes; ( 4) The result of pre-diction demonstrates that the wetting climate change will improve the natural vegetation NPP in Xinjiang in the fu-ture,but climate warming will have unfavorable effect on NPP. Holistic,under the precondition of other invariable factors,the NPP will be increased by 20% once the annual precipitation is increased by 10% ,and the NPP will be decreased by 4% -6% once the annual temperature is increased by 1 \u2103.

The calculation of the net primary productivity (NPP) was based on the Miami model,Thornthwaite Memorial model,Chikugo model,Zhu Zhihui model and Zhou Guangsheng model separately. The responses of the NPP to climatic change were analyzed by the computation and the contrastive analysis. The results showed that the climate obviously had a warmer and wetter tendency in Tianshan mountain areas,in recent 47 years. The climate mutation from cold and dry to warm and wet occurred in 1970. Although there were some differences in the NPP based on various models,the response tendency of the spatial and temporal distribution of the NPP to climate change was the same. The NPP in Tianshan mountain areas obviously increased under the background of the climate change with warmer and wetter trend. The NPP mutation was in 1970 too. The NPP based on various models had a three to 22 years periodic change at the different time scales,which was completely consistent with changes of the annual average temperature and precipitation. Among all of the different pastures,the NNP in the meadow prairie and mountainous region meadow was the highest,while it was the lowest in the cold prairie,and it was between in the high and cold meadow,and the desert. Finally,the mutual conversion relations of NPP based on the various models were established.",

        "abstract": "Based on the daily temperature data of sixteen meteorological stations in \ue41er\ue412mqi City and the Changji Hui national autonomous prefecture of Xinjiang(the \ue41er\ue412mqi-Changji region) during 1961-2010,the fundamental spatial and temporal change characteristics of the annual accumulated temperature of \u226510\u2103,July(the warmest month in a year) mean temperature and frost-free period were analyzed by using the linear regression method,the t-test and the three-dimensional and quadratic trend surface simulation and the inverse-distance squared weighting residual error revising based on GIS.The cotton-planting climate zoning for the \ue41er\ue412mqi-Changji region in 1961-2003 and 2004-2010 were completed with the climate indicators of cotton zoning.Possible changes of climate zoning for cotton planting relative to that in 1961-2010 were projected for the future when annual mean temperature increases 1\u2103,2\u2103,3\u2103 and 4\u2103,respectively.The main results are as follows: the agro-climatic heat resource in 1961-2010 was obviously different from areas of the \ue41er\ue412mqi-Changji region;generally,the annual accumulated temperature of \u226510\u2103,July mean temperature and frost-free period were higher/longer in plain areas than in mountainous areas.The three indicators showed an increasing trend at the rates of 52.3\u2103\u00b7d/10a\u30010.1\u2103/10a and 3.3 d/10a in 1961-2010,and had an abrupt increase,rise and extension in 1995,2004 and 1987,respectively.Under the joint effects of the above-mentioned climate factors,the area suitable for cotton growing after 2004 had a substantial expansion relative to that before 2004,but the areas secondly suitable,risk and unsuitable for cotton growing reduced to different extent.The global warming in future will significantly affect the cotton zoning in the \ue41er\ue412mqi-Changji region.Overall,under the premise of other conditions remaining invariant,when the annual mean temperature increases by 1\u2103 relative to that of 1961-2010,the area suitable for cotton growing will increase 6600 km2,and the areas secondly suitable and unsuitable for cotton growing will reduce 2100 km2 and 4700 km2,respectively,but change in the area risk for cotton growing will be very small.",

        "abstract": "Based on the monthly sunshine duration, total cloud cover and low cloud cover data during 1961-2010 from 101 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, the spatial-temporal change characteristics of seasonal and annual sunshine duration, and the connection between annual sunshine duration with total cloud cover and low cloud cover were analyzed by using the methods of linear regression, Mann-Kendall test, three-dimensional quadratic trend surface simulation and Kriging residual error revision based on GIS. The main results are obtained as follows. (1) There was an obvious regional difference in climatic distribution of seasonal and annual sunshine duration, generally, the sunshine duration of spring increased from the southwest to northeast. In summer, the sunshine duration was longer in the northern and eastern parts than in the southern and western parts, and it was longer in plain and valley than in mountainous areas. Autumn sunshine duration increased southeast to northwest, and in winter it increased from west to east in Xinjiang. Affected by their joint effect, the annual sunshine duration increased from west to east, mountainous areas to plain and valley in Xinjiang. (2) The changing trend of spring sunshine duration was not significant, but that of the summer, autumn, winter and annual sunshine duration showed a significant decreasing trend with the rate of -4.27 h \u00b7 (10a)-1, -4.30 h \u00b7 (10a)-1, -14.36 h \u00b7 (10a)-1 and -19.42 h \u00b7 (10a)-1 respectively in recent 50 years, and summer, autumn, winter and annual values had mutations in 1988, 1986, 1987 and 1982, respectively, but there were regional differences before and after mutations. For example, the annual sunshine duration increased in Turpan-Hami Basin and southern Tarim Basin, while it showed a decreasing trend in most parts of Xinjiang, especially in Junggar Basin, areas along the Tianshan Mountains, central and eastern parts of Tarim Basin. (3) The cloud cover was the main factor influencing sunshine duration in Xinjiang. On the whole, the areas with less total and low cloud cover have relatively much sunshine duration, and vice versa. In recent 50 years, the total amount of cloud did not change significantly, but low cloud cover increased significantly, which was the main cause for the decrease of sunshine duration in Xinjiang.",

Based on the climatic data of 101 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2008 in Xinjiang, the annual ETo was calculated with Penman-Monteith equation recommended by FAO in 1998, and the spatial and temporal variation characteristic of the annual ETo and its climatic causes were analyzed by using linear regression method, Mann-Kendall abrupt test and three-dimensional quadratic trend surface simulation and inverse-distance square weighting residual error revising based on GIS. The main results show that the spatial distribution of annual ETo was obviously different in the different regions of Xinjiang. Generally, the annual ETo was larger in southern than it in northern, eastern was larger than western, basin (valley) was larger than in mountain regions in Xinjiang. By the comprehensive influence of the significantly increasing tendency of the mean temperature and air relative humidity, and the significantly decreasing of the sunshine hour and the wind speed, the annual ETo was significantly decreasing and it had significantly sudden decrease in 1981, but the decrease rate and range of the annual ETo had distinct regional differences. In general, the decrease rate and range of the annual ETo was large in the area of the ETo stronger, and vice versa. It has important significance of annual ETo decrease to reducing the amount of crop water requirement and farmland irrigation, reducing surface dryness, and improving vulnerable ecological environment in Xinjiang.",

        "abstract": "Urumqi City and Changji Hui national autonomous prefecture (Urumqi-Changji region) is located in the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains and southern edge of the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang. The precipitation is extremely less and evaporation is high over this region. Dry climate and water shortage are the major factors restricting local socio-economic development, especially agricultural production and environmental protection. To investigate characteristics of dry-wet climate change in the past 49 years in the Urumqi-Changji region, based on monthly climate data from 1961 to 2009 at 16 meteorological stations across the Urumqi-Changji region, fundamental characteristics of spatial-temporal change in various dry-wet climate variables, such as annual precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (ETo), dry-wet index, and water deficiency, were comprehensively analyzed using methods of linear regression, Mann-Kendall test, three-dimensional and quadratic trend surface simulation, and inverse distance weighting interpolation. Results show that the dry-wet climate is completely different for varying regions in the Urumqi-Changji region. In general, the annual precipitation and dry-wet index are larger in the Tianshan Mountain areas and western areas than in plain and eastern areas. ETo and water deficiency are generally larger in plain and eastern areas than in the Tianshan mountain areas and western areas in the Urumqi-Changji region. A climate wetting trend was evident in recent 49 years. The annual precipitation and dry-wet index showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 13.843 mm/10a and 0.016/10a, respectively, showing a significantly abrupt increase in 1990 and 1987, respectively. ETo and water deficiency showed a significantly decreasing trend at a rate of -16.07mm/10a and -29.909mm/10a, respectively, with abrupt decreases occurring in 1983 and 1986, respectively. In general, the climate showed an obvious wetting trend over the recent 49 years. The increasing range of precipitation and the dry-wet index in the Tianshan Mountain areas was larger than in plain areas. The decreasing range of ETo and water deficiency in central plain areas was larger than in the Tianshan mountain areas and Gurbantunggut desert edge areas. It was found that the climate has become humid, which would lead to increases in water resources, decreases in evapotranspiration from farmland and natural vegetation, reductions in crop water requirement, and be conducive to easing fierce contradictions between water supply and demand and improving the fragile environment over the study region.",

A lot of video watermarking schemes are proposed to prevent malicious attacks in recent years. An innovative algorithm is proposed in this work to resist key frames dropping and detect the subtitle tampered. Firstly, Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) Superpixels are used to extract the natural codes of the video. Meanwhile, the targeting codes are obtained from the natural codes which are modified by the (7, 4) Hamming code error correction for identifying the watermarked frame. Secondly, the text region is located accurately by structure tensor and subtitle segmentation. Furthermore, the watermark information is composed of stroke and structural characteristic of Chinese characters. Finally, the watermark is embedded into the oral history videos based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) robustly. The experimental results show the algorithm is against to several attacks including tampering texts, frames dropping and compression.",

To solve the copyright protection of game texture image, a novel data hiding algorithm based on Hamming +1 technology is proposed in this paper. The secret messages are embedded into the modulation information of PVRTC (PowerVR Texture Compression) texture format which is popular in computer game. Due to the coding rules of the PVRTC texture format, the decompressed image quality will be reduced after secret messages are embedded. So the optimization mechanism is applied to improve the image quality. The experimental results show that this method is effective and can be applied to the copyright protection of the game texture images.\n\n",

        "abstract": "The market for electronic games is big. The infringement of game concept design copyright is one big problem. Current copy detection methods use low-level features for image content matching and are difficult to perform copy detection of game character concept design. Therefore, we propose a copy detection method based on pose features. First, basic rotation correction is performed using corner detection of the character's shoulder inflection points. The joint points of a character's pose are extracted using a bottom-up pedestrian detection network and used as pose feature vector. Then, face joint points are used to calculate a representative point using face reduction, and are described using rotation invariant local coordinate description. Finally, the similarity is calculated using confidence weight, the threshold is used to determine whether an image is a copy. The experimental results show that our detection algorithm is robust against various attacks such as rotation, scaling and replacement of color, accessories, weapon of game character concept design.\n\n",

        "abstract": "High-voltage transmission towers are built to supply electricity for campuses and local residents. In order to guarantee the power supply and safety for remote campus, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to take the images of high power lines to alarm potential malfunction. A novel method of bird\u2019s nest images detection based on cascade classifier and combination features is proposed. Different features of the bird\u2019s nest and iron tower are analyzed, and the following four novel features are proposed: proportion of white area (PWA), ratio of white pixels (RWP) in each lap, projection feature (PF), and improved burr feature (IBF). The combined features are used to describe the characteristics of the bird\u2019s nest backbone area and the edges, respectively. Furthermore, the cascade classifier combined with the four proposed features is used for the further classification of bird\u2019s nest region. The proposed detection process mainly consists of three stages. First, the suspected bird\u2019s nest region is obtained by template convolution. Second, PWA and RWP with low dimensionality and high discrimination are used to classify the sample set of suspected nest region. Third, based on the previous classification results with positive and negative samples, PF and IBF are adopted to further conduct the secondary classification in order to reduce the misclassified samples, and the final classification label is determined by the second classification results. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect the nest and achieve good performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper is to investigate a novel framework of robust video watermarking based on the statistical model with robustness against multiple attacks. The main contribution is threefold. First, the Laplacian distribution is proposed to model each naive video frame, referring to as the original frame; meanwhile the noisy frame, referring to as the one with adding Gaussian-distributed noise, is modeled using the Gaussian distribution. Second, we propose a novel mechanism of embedding watermark by artificially adding noise or not, corresponding to watermark bit 1 or 0. Third, it is proposed to cast the problem of watermark extraction into the framework of hypothesis testing theory. In the ideal context, with knowing all the model parameters, the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is smoothly established with verifying the feasibility of the designed watermark extraction based on the statistical models. In the case of estimating model parameters, we propose to design the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) to deal with the practical problem of watermark extraction. Finally, compared with some prior arts, extensive experimental results show that our proposed novel framework of robust video watermarking can achieve the high video quality with robustness against various attacks such as re-scaling, cropping, and compression.",

        "abstract": "With the growing application of quick response (QR) code on bike-share service, there is the possibility of tampering and replacing the QR code. Thus the security of the personal information and the property are fragile. To solve the problem, we propose the multiple QR code authentication schemes for bike-share service. The hierarchy visual cryptography system (HVCS) is combined with the error correction of QR code in Scheme I. Firstly, the secret image for authentication is encrypted into two shared images (referred to as shadows) according to improved (2, 2)-PVCS. Secondly, one of the shadows is stored in cloud server and the another shadow is encrypted into n sub-shadows based on probability. Then these sub-shadows are fused with QR codes to get the security QR codes which are posted on bikes. Finally, when users scan the security QR codes (shadows) by smartphone, the shadow stored in cloud server is downloaded and stack with the scanned QR code to decode the secret image for QR code authentication. Scheme II is a method of adapting multiply secret images for batter visual effect. The multi-secret visual cryptography system (MVCS) and the XOR mechanism of RS with Positives Basis Vector Matrix (PBVM) are combined. Firstly, a random grid is generated as the special shadow in cloud server. Secondly a series of shadows is generated according to the MVCS. Then these shadows are fused with QR code by XOR mechanism of RS code to obtain the security QR codes. Finally, secret images are decoded by stacking the special shadow and security QR codes. Experimental results show that our methods has great capacity and high security.",

Such algorithms are weak in protecting against frame attacks. In order to improve the robustness, we take into consideration the correlation and redundancy among the frames of a video to propose a blind video watermark algorithm based on tensor decomposition. First, a grayscale video is represented as a 3-order tensor, and the core tensor is obtained by tensor decomposition. Second, the watermark embedding position is selected based on the stability of the maximum value in the core tensor because the core tensor represents the main energy of a video. Then, the watermark is embedded by quantifying the maximum value in the core tensor. Finally, the watermark is uniformly distributed across frames of a video by inverse tensor decomposition. The experiments show that our algorithm based on tensor decomposition has better imperceptibility and robustness against common video attacks.",

        "abstract": "A set of rice (Oryza sativa L.) recombinant inbred lines from a cross between Zhenshan 97 (indica) and HR5 (indica) was planted for four different growing seasons in two locations at three nitrogen (N) fertilization levels (N300, 300 kg urea/ha; N150, 150 kg urea/ha; and N0, 0 kg urea/ha). Grain yield and its components were evaluated, including grain yield per plant (GYPP), panicle number per plant (PNPP), grain number per panicle (GNPP), filled grains per panicle (FGPP), spikelet fertility percentage (SFP) and 100-grain weight (HGW). Correlation and path analysis indicated that SFP had the greatest contribution to GYPP at the N300 and N150 levels, but FGPP contributed the most to GYPP at the N0 level. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped based on a mixed linear model; genetic components (main effects, epistatic effects and QTL-by-environment interactions) were estimated separately. Six to 15 QTL with main effects were detected for each trait except SFP. Clusters of main-effect QTL associated with PNPP, GNPP, SFP and HGW were observed in regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The main-effect QTL (qGYPP-4b and qGNPP-12) were only detected at the N0 level and explained 10. 9 and 10. 2% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. A total of 33 digenic interactions among grain yield and its components were also identified. The identification of genomic regions associated with yield and its components at different nitrogen levels will be useful in marker-assisted selection for improving the nitrogen use efficiency of rice. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Under normal N level, 3 QTLs were detected for each trait, while under low N level, 5, 4, 5 and 2 QTLs were detected for PH, PN, CC and SDW respectively. Most of the QTLs were located on chromosome 2, 3, 7, 11 and 12. QTLs controlling different traits or the same trait under different N levels were mapped on the same or adjacent intervals, forming sev-eral clusters in rice chromosomes. More than two traits were controlled by QTLs on one of four intervals (RM30-RM439, RM18-RM478, RM309-RM270, and RM235-RM17), suggesting that there were some pleiotropic effects. It was supposed that some QTLs only detected at low N level might be associated with the ability to tolerate the low N stress in rice.",

        "abstract": "In this work, FeCoV alloys were annealed in vacuum at various temperatures for different time, with and without applying an external magnetic field, respectively. The effect of the annealing on their magnetic properties has been investigated in regard with microstructural characterizations. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the alloy is characterized of \u03b1 -Fe bcc structure. It has been found that an order\u2013disorder phase transformation took place locally in the surface around 993 K. In addition, \u03b1 \u2013 \u03b3 phase transformation occurs at the same temperature at which the Curie point is observed in the TG curve. Coercivity is decreased with increasing annealing temperatures, and changed from about 3.2 kA/m to 78 A/m when the annealing temperatures are increased to 1173 K. Microstructural observations show that the decrease of coercivity after annealing is contributed mainly by grain growth. The coercivity of the alloy is further decreased by 32 A/m after magnetic field annealing at 1033 K. Hysteresis loops of the alloys after field annealing at 1033 K featured more rectangular shape with smaller coercivity, compared with those after vacuum annealing. Keywords FeCo alloy Vacuum annealing Magnetic properties Order\u2013disorder transition 1 Introduction The FeCo alloys, which are known as soft magnetic materials with maximum saturation magnetization ( M s ) and high Curie temperature ( T c ), have been an interesting research topic [1\u20133] . It is well known that the alloys are used for the stator and rotor of the generator, and its weight and performance are dependent largely on the magnetic properties of the alloys. Generally speaking, the total power losses of the generator could be divided into three parts: hysteresis loss, eddy current loss and relaxation loss, in which the third one is usually neglected because of its mild contribution to the total loss. The eddy current loss can be successfully reduced by increasing the electrical resistance of materials and decreasing the thickness of the laminations. On the other hand, hysteresis loss is a function of the coercivity of the magnetic materials used for generator [4,5] . Therefore, it is of great importance to decrease coercivity from the practical point of view. According to the Fe\u2013Co phase diagram [6] , a disorder to long-range order transition ( A 2 \u2013 B 2 ) occurs around 1003 K in the ideal binary FeCo alloys with a weight ratio of cobalt from 30% to 70%. A recent research has revealed that the A 2\u2013 B 2 transition only occurred in the surface of the alloy when the alloy was annealed in air atmosphere [7] . This transition is believed to increase its brittleness and deteriorate its mechanical workability, which is hereby suppressed by adding a moderate amount (\u22482%) of third element vanadium to the binary system. Previous work has placed much attention on the phase transformation, annealing process or the grain growth [3,7\u201311] . However, the relationship of those parameters and magnetic properties are required to be studied in order to improve the soft magnetic properties of the alloys. Many things still remain unclear regarding the effect of annealing on the magnetic properties [12,13] . In this work, the effect of vacuum annealing and field annealing on soft magnetic properties has been investigated and discussed in terms of the corresponding microstructural variations. 2 Experimental procedures The main chemical composition of the specimens was Fe52.2Co46V1.8, examined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The specimens were machined into 10\u00d72\u00d70.2 (mm) sheets. The magnetization ( M s ) and coercivity ( H c ) for the cold-rolled alloys were 240 emu/g and 3.2 kA/m, respectively. The specimens were subjected to annealing in a vacuum of 10 \u22123 Pa at various temperatures. The cooling rate was set about 250 K/h [2,13] . In field annealing, a directional current (DC) field was applied along the longitudinal direction of the specimens in the plane before cooling processes started. After annealing, the magnetic properties and the micro-hardness of the specimens were measured at room temperature using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and HXZ-1000 sclerometer, respectively. The experimental results are the average of three samples to ensure repetition. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves along TG curves were measured in an argon atmosphere, at a heating rate of 20 K/min and cooling rate of 20 K/min (DSC). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied to investigate structure and microstructural characterizations. As to the specimen preparation for SEM observation, specimens were polished, and then they were etched with a chemical solution composed of 5 g copper chloride, hydrochloric acid, ethanol and water 20 ml, respectively. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 show XRD patterns for the alloys before and after annealing at 1033 and 1123 K for (a) 1 h and (b) 2 h. It is revealed that the alloy is characterized of \u03b1 -Fe bcc structure. Three peaks of 1 1 0, 2 0 0 and 2 1 1 are observed for the alloys before annealing, and it can be seen that 2 0 0 texture appears after annealing at 1033 K for 2 h and 1123 K for 1 h. The texture vanished again when annealing at higher temperatures or for a longer holding time. The structural variation with annealing temperatures indicates that second recrystallization occurred for the alloys during the annealing process. From the XRD result, it can be obtained that a higher temperature and/or longer holding time should be demanded for the occurrence of recrystallization. Fig. 2 displays DSC analysis along with TG curves for the as-alloy during heating and cooling processes, respectively. From the DSC curves, a discontinuous point can be observed at 993 K, implying that a second-order phase transformation took place around the temperature. It can be inferred from quasi-binary Fe\u2013Co phase diagram [12] that the transient point corresponds to order\u2013disorder phase transformation, although it was not detected by XRD profiles in this work. The result seemed to be different from the previous results that no A 2 \u2013B 2 transition could be observable for the alloy after annealing in vacuum [7] . This can be explained as following. Since the DSC analysis was performed in a base vacuum lower than 10 \u22123 Pa, it is considerable that the surface might be slightly oxidized, which would cause a change in composition in the surface. It has been reported in the previous work [14] that a short-range ordering, that is, A 2 \u2013B 2 transition occurred locally in the surface layer around 993 K, induced by the different compositions or activities of the atoms between the surface and interior of the alloy. The failure to detect the change by XRD profiles is thoughtful to be ascribed by small amount of oxide layers and order phase in the surface. In addition, a sharp peak is also observed at 1240 K in the heating curve, and shifted to a lower temperature in the cooling curve. The peak was attributed to the phase transformation from \u03b1 to \u03b3 , based on the Fe\u2013Co phase diagram. It should be noted that the \u03b1 \u2013 \u03b3 phase transformation occurs at the same temperature at which the Curie point is observed in the TG curve, indicating that the ferromagnetism and para -ferromagnetism transition is associated closely with the \u03b1 \u2013 \u03b3 phase transformation. The different position of the peak in the heating and cooling curves, as shown in Fig. 2(a) , is caused simply by a delay in phase transformation because the cooling rate was not slow enough. We can also observe a delay for magnetic transition in the TG curve during the cooling process, corresponding to the result from DSC curves. The change of magnetic properties was also investigated with annealing process in this work. Fig. 3 shows the hysteresis loops for the alloys before and after annealing at the temperatures of 823 and 1033 K. It has been seen that magnetic properties are becoming softer with increasing annealing temperatures. Hysteresis area for the alloy annealed at 1033 K is dramatically reduced compared to the others. The variation of coercivity with annealing temperatures is demonstrated in Fig. 4 . We can find that the coercivity begins to abruptly decrease at a certain point with increasing the annealing temperatures to around 1073 K, and shows only a little decline with further increasing temperatures. The point at which the coerecivity began to change has been shifted to lower annealing temperature regions when annealing time was increased. The coercivity decreases from 131 to 117 A/m when increasing annealing time from 1 to 4 h at 1033 K, showing a slight decline with increasing annealing time. The minimum coercivity of 78 A/m was obtained in this work after annealing at 1173 K for 4 h. The changes in magnetic properties for the annealed alloys can be expected to be associated closely with microstructural characterizations. It seems, however, that a slight amount of order\u2013disorder phase transformation has only a limited affect on the change of soft magnetic properties for the alloys after annealing. Fig. 5 shows SEM micrographs for the alloys before and after various annealing. It can be found that recrystallization did not take place after annealing at the temperatures below 923 K. The grain growth started at temperatures above 923 K, and the grain size is about 10\u201315 and 20\u201330 \u03bcm after annealing at 1033 and 1123 K, respectively. From the change of micro-hardness with annealing temperatures, as shown in Fig. 6 , it is found that the micro-hardness first increases by 100 Hv after annealing at around 823 K before it starts to decrease, and shows a value of 220 Hv after annealing at 1123 K. The grain growth induced by annealing at higher temperatures leads to the decrease in micro-hardness. From the results of SEM observations and micro-hardness, we can obtain that the decrease of coercivity after annealing was contributed mainly by the grain growth. Effect of field annealing on the magnetic properties has also been investigated in this work. Fig. 7 shows the change of coercivity with applied magnetic field during annealing process at 1033 K. It can be seen that coercivity was further decreased by 32 A/m as the applied field increases to 200 Oe, followed by a plateau range with further increasing the field. Hysteresis loops of the alloys after field annealing at 1033 K showed that magnetic field annealing has made the loops more rectangular with smaller coercivity, compared with those after vacuum annealing. On the contrary, it is not observed that coercivity was decreased with increasing magnetic field at 873 K, which is lower than the order\u2013disorder transition temperature. It can be considered that the effect of magnetic field on coercivity should be linked with the order\u2013disorder transition. 4 Conclusions In this work the change of microstructure and magnetic properties for Fe\u2013Co\u2013V alloys has been investigated after vacuum annealing with and without applied magnetic field. XRD analysis showed that the alloy was characterized of \u03b1 -Fe bcc structure. It has been found that an order\u2013disorder phase transformation took place locally in the surface around 993 K. The coercivity begins to abruptly decrease at an annealing temperature for a given holding time. The low coercivity of 78 A/m was obtained for the alloy after annealing at 1173 K for 4 h. From the results of SEM observations and micro-hardness, we can obtain that the decrease of coercivity after annealing was contributed mainly by grain growth. The coercivity of the alloy was further decreased by 32 A/m after magnetic field annealing at 1033 K. Hysteresis loops after field annealing at 1033 K were more rectangular with smaller coercivity, compared with those after vacuum annealing.
