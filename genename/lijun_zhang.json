        "abstract": "Herman's algorithm is a synchronous randomized protocol for achieving self-stabilization in a token ring consisting of N processes. The interaction of tokens makes the dynamics of the protocol very difficult to analyze. In this paper we study the expected time to stabilization in terms of the initial configuration. It is straightforward that the algorithm achieves stabilization almost surely from any initial configuration, and it is known that the worst-case expected time to stabilization (with respect to the initial configuration) is \u0398(N2). Our first contribution is to give an upper bound of 0.64N2 on the expected stabilization time, improving on previous upper bounds and reducing the gap with the best existing lower bound. We also introduce an asynchronous version of the protocol, showing a similar O(N2) convergence bound in this case. Assuming that errors arise from the corruption of some number k of bits, where k is fixed independently of the size of the ring, we show that the expected time to stabilization is O(N). This reveals a hitherto unknown and highly desirable property of Herman's algorithm: it recovers quickly from bounded errors. We also show that if the initial configuration arises by resetting each bit independently and uniformly at random, then stabilization is significantly faster than in the worst case.",

A PMDP denotes a family of concrete MDPs. This paper studies the synthesis problem for PCTL in PMDPs: Given a specification F in PCTL, we synthesise the parameter valuations under which F is true. First, we divide the possible parameter space into hyper-rectangles. We use existing decision procedures to check whether F holds on each of the Markov processes represented by the hyper-rectangle. As it is normally impossible to cover the whole parameter space by hyper-rectangles, we allow a limited area to remain undecided. We also consider an extension of PCTL with reachability rewards. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we apply our technique on a case study, using a preliminary implementation.",

At the core of the refinement step lies the implicit or explicit analysis of a counterexample. This article proposes an abstraction refinement approach for the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL), which is based on incrementally computing a sequence of may- and must-quotient automata.

It has gained some popularity as the coarsest behavioral equivalence enjoying valuable properties like preservation of trace distribution equivalence and compositionality. This holds in the classical context of arbitrary schedulers, but it has been argued that this class of schedulers is unrealistically powerful. This paper studies a strictly coarser notion of bisimilarity, which still enjoys these properties in the context of realistic subclasses of schedulers: Trace distribution equivalence is implied for partial information schedulers, and compositionality is preserved by distributed schedulers. The intersection of the two scheduler classes thus spans a coarser and still reasonable compositional theory of behavioral semantics.",

We also demonstrate the applicability of these abstraction techniques to the computation of long-run average reward properties and the synthesis of controllers.

As for the classical setting, it is established that any (probabilistic tree) property is equivalent to a conjunction of a safety and liveness property. A simple algorithm is provided to obtain such a property decomposition for flat probabilistic CTL (PCTL). A safe fragment of PCTL is identified that provides a sound and complete characterisation of safety properties. For liveness properties, we provide two PCTL fragments, a sound and a complete one, and show that a sound and complete logical characterisation of liveness properties hinges on the (open) satisfiability problem for PCTL. We show that safety properties only have finite counterexamples, whereas liveness properties have none. We compare our characterisation for qualitative properties with the one for branching time properties by Manolios and Trefler, and present sound and complete PCTL fragments for characterising the notions of strong safety and absolute liveness coined by Sistla.",

It has gained some popularity as the coarsest behavioral equivalence enjoying valuable properties like preservation of trace distribution equivalence and compositionality. This holds in the classical context of arbitrary schedulers, but it has been argued that this class of schedulers is unrealistically powerful. This paper studies a strictly coarser notion of bisimilarity, which still enjoys these properties in the context of realistic subclasses of schedulers: Trace distribution equivalence is implied for partial information schedulers, and compositionality is preserved by distributed schedulers. The intersection of the two scheduler classes thus spans a coarser and still reasonable compositional theory of behavioral semantics.",

In this paper we propose strong and weak bisimulations for CTMDPs and show that for a subclass of CTMDPs, strong and weak bisimulations are both sound and complete with respect to the equivalences induced by CSL and the sub-logic of CSL without next operator respectively. We then consider a standard extension of CSL, and show that it and its sub-logic without X can be fully characterized by strong and weak bisimulations respectively over arbitrary CTMDPs. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Given a parametric Markov model, we consider the problem of computing the formula expressing the probability of reaching a given set of states. To attack this principal problem, Daws has suggested to first convert the Markov chain into a finite automaton, from which a regular expression is computed. Afterwards, this expression is evaluated to a closed form expression representing the reachability probability. This paper investigates how this idea can be turned into an effective procedure. It turns out that the bottleneck lies in an exponential growth of the regular expression relative to the number of states. We therefore proceed differently, by tightly intertwining the regular expression compu- tation with its evaluation. This allows us to arrive at an effective method that avoids the exponential blow up in most practical cases. We give a detailed account of the approach, also extending to parametric models with rewards and with non-determinism. Experimental evidence is pro- vided, illustrating that our implementation provides meaningful insights on non-trivial models.",

We consider the problem of model repair for MDPs defined as follows: if the MDP fails to satisfy a property, we aim to find new values for the transition probabilities so that the property is guaranteed to hold, while at the same time the cost of repair is minimised. Because solving the MDP repair problem exactly is infeasible, in this paper we focus on approximate solution methods. We first formulate a region-based approach, which yields an interval in which the minimal repair cost is contained. As an alternative, we also consider sampling based approaches, which are faster but unable to provide lower bounds on the repair cost. We have integrated both methods into the probabilistic model checker PRISM and demonstrated their usefulness in practice using a computer virus case study.",

        "abstract": "The design of complex concurrent systems often involves intricate performance and dependability considerations. Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are a widely used modeling formalism that captures such performance and dependability properties, and makes them analyzable by model checking. In this paper, we focus on time-bounded probabilistic properties of infinite-state CTMCs, expressible in a subset of continuous stochastic logic (CSL). This comprises important dependability measures, such as time-bounded probabilistic reachability, performability, survivability, and various availability measures like instantaneous, conditional instantaneous and interval availabilities. Conventional model checkers explore the given model exhaustively, which is often costly, due to state explosion, and sometimes impossible because the model is infinite. This paper presents a method that only explores the model up to a finite depth. The required depth is determined on the fly by an algorithm that is configurable in order to adapt to the characteristics of different classes of models. We provide experimental evidence showing that our method is effective.",

In this paper, we aim at identifying minimal automata and canonical representations for concurrent probabilistic models. We present minimality and canonicity results for probabilistic and Markov automata modulo strong and weak probabilistic bisimilarity, together with the corresponding minimization algorithms. We also consider weak distribution bisimilarity, originally proposed for Markov automata. For this relation, the quest for minimality does not have a unique answer, since fanout minimality clashes with state and transition minimality. We present an SMT approach to enumerate fanout-minimal models.",

Recently, multivariate Lagrange interpolation has been applied to synthesizing polynomial invariants. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach. First, we fix a polynomial template as a candidate of a loop invariant. Using Stengle\u2019s Positivstellensatz and a transformation to a sum-of-squares problem, we find sufficient conditions on the coefficients. Then, we solve a semidefinite programming feasibility problem to synthesize the loop invariants. If the semidefinite program is unfeasible, we backtrack after increasing the degree of the template. Our approach is semi-complete in the sense that it will always lead us to a feasible solution if one exists and numerical errors are small. Experimental results show the efficiency of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Formal verification of parameterized protocols such as cache coherence protocols is a significant challenge. In this article, we propose an automatic proving approach and its prototype paraVerifier to handle this challenge within a unified framework as follows: (1) To prove the correctness of a parameterized protocol, our approach automatically discovers auxiliary invariants and the corresponding dependency relations among the discovered invariants and protocol rules from a small instance of the to-be-verified protocol, and (2) the discovered invariants and dependency graph are then automatically generalized into a parameterized form and sent to the theorem prover, Isabelle. As a side product, the final verification result of a protocol is provided by a formal and human-readable proof. Our approach has been successfully applied to a number of benchmarks, including snoopying-based and directory-based cache coherence protocols.\n\n",

We first extend multiphase until formulas in continuous stochastic logic (CSL) with reward constraints. Then we present an effective integral-style algorithm to compute the probability under the assumption of harmony, and give upper and lower bounds of the probability without this assumption. Furthermore, the resulting probability value (or its upper and lower bounds) is shown to be a real number of a well-formed structure, with which we can successfully (or partially) decide whether the constraints in the CSL formula are satisfied. Our method is entirely based on algebraic manipulations and number theory. Finally, to show the practical usefulness, we apply the results to evaluate the performance of a small multi-processor system.",

Most of the existing co-clustering algorithms focus on modeling the relationship between samples and features, whereas the intersample and interfeature relationships are ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel coclustering algorithm named Locally Discriminative Coclustering (LDCC) to explore the relationship between samples and features as well as the intersample and interfeature relationships. Specifically, the sample-feature relationship is modeled by a bipartite graph between samples and features. And we apply local linear regression to discovering the intrinsic discriminative structures of both sample space and feature space. For each local patch in the sample and feature spaces, a local linear function is estimated to predict the labels of the points in this patch. The intersample and interfeature relationships are thus captured by minimizing the fitting errors of all the local linear functions. In this way, LDCC groups strongly associated samples and features together, while respecting the local structures of both sample and feature spaces. Our experimental results on several benchmark data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We consider semi-supervised graph based dimensionality reduction in this paper, and a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm called constrained Laplacian Eigenmap (CLE) is proposed. Suppose the data set contains r classes, and for each class we have some labeled points. CLE maps each data point into r different lines, and each map i tries to separate points belonging to class i from others by using label information. CLE constrains the solution space of Laplacian Eigenmap only to contain embedding results that are consistent with the labels. Then, each point is represented as a r-dimensional vector. Labeled points belonging to the same class are merged together, labeled points belonging to different classes are separated, and similar points are close to one another. We perform semi-supervised document clustering using CLE on two standard corpora. Experimental results show that CLE is very effective.",

Previous studies separately address these two problems, despite of the fact that selecting features and instances are dual operations over a data matrix. In this paper, we consider the novel problem of simultaneously selecting the most informative features and instances and develop a solution from the perspective of optimum experimental design. That is, by using the selected features as the new representation and the selected instances as training data, the variance of the parameter estimate of a learning function can be minimized. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, which is called Unified criterion for Feature and Instance selection (UFI), to simultaneously identify the most informative features and instances that minimize the trace of the parameter covariance matrix. A greedy algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "To generate high quality answers, many question tax- onomies designed for modern question answering systems are getting more and more complex and fine-grained. Fur- thermore, without concrete context some questions are am- biguous and are difficult to be correctly labeled by question classifier, even by people manually. All above bring a big challenge to current question classifiers. However, previous research seldom pays attention to these situations above. In general, the labeled question dataset is usually small, so a feasible solution to these issues is to integrate new feed- backs and certain domain-specific knowledge into current model continuously. In this paper we explore the applica- tion of an online learning algorithm to question classifica- tion. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is comparable to other popular learning al- gorithms: SVMs and SNoW. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach on ambiguous questions and the results prove its feasibility and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Online monitoring of temporally-sequenced news streams for interesting patterns and trends has gained popularity in the last\n decade. In this paper, we study a particular news stream monitoring task: timely detection of bursty events which have happened\n recently and discovery of their evolutionary patterns along the timeline. Here, a news stream is represented as feature streams\n of tens of thousands of features (i.e., keyword. Each news story consists of a set of keywords.). A bursty event therefore\n is composed of a group of bursty features, which show bursty rises in frequency as the related event emerges. In this paper,\n we give a formal definition to the above problem and present a solution with the following steps: (1) applying an online multi-resolution\n burst detection method to identify bursty features with different bursty durations within a recent time period; (2) clustering\n bursty features to form bursty events and associating each event with a power value which reflects its bursty level; (3) applying\n an information retrieval method based on cosine similarity to discover the event\u2019s evolution (i.e., highly related bursty\n events in history) along the timeline. We extensively evaluate the proposed methods on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1. Experimental\n results show that our methods can detect bursty events in a timely way and effectively discover their evolution. The power\n values used in our model not only measure event\u2019s bursty level or relative importance well at a certain time point but also\n show relative strengths of events along the same evolution.",

        "abstract": "We consider the active learning problem which aims to select the most representative points. Out of many existing active learning techniques, optimum experimental design (OED) has received considerable attention recently. The typical OED criteria minimize the variance of the parameter estimates or predicted value. However, these methods see only global Euclidean structure, while the local manifold structure is ignored. For example, I-optimal design selects those data points such that other data points can be best approximated by linear combinations of all the selected points. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm which takes into account the local structure of the data space. That is, each data point should be approximated by the linear combination of only its neighbors. Given the local reconstruction coefficients for every data point and the coordinates of the selected points, a transductive learning algorithm called Locally Linear Reconstruction (LLR) is proposed to reconstruct every other point. The most representative points are thus defined as those whose coordinates can be used to best reconstruct the whole data set. The sequential and convex optimization schemes are also introduced to solve the optimization problem. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Acoustic-based music recommender systems have received increasing interest in recent years. Due to the semantic gap between low level acoustic features and high level music concepts, many researchers have explored collaborative filtering techniques in music recommender systems. Traditional collaborative filtering music recommendation methods only focus on user rating information. However, there are various kinds of social media information, including different types of objects and relations among these objects, in music social communities such as Last.fm and Pandora. This information is valuable for music recommendation. However, there are two challenges to exploit this rich social media information: (a) There are many different types of objects and relations in music social communities, which makes it difficult to develop a unified framework taking into account all objects and relations. (b) In these communities, some relations are much more sophisticated than pairwise relation, and thus cannot be simply modeled by a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel music recommendation algorithm by using both multiple kinds of social media information and music acoustic-based content. Instead of graph, we use hypergraph to model the various objects and relations, and consider music recommendation as a ranking problem on this hypergraph. While an edge of an ordinary graph connects only two objects, a hyperedge represents a set of objects. In this way, hypergraph can be naturally used to model high-order relations. Experiments on a data set collected from the music social community Last.fm have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",

It is an unsupervised learning algorithm, which finds a basis set capturing high-level semantics in the data and learns sparse coordinates in terms of the basis set. Originally applied to modeling the human visual cortex, sparse coding has been shown useful for many applications. However, most of the existing approaches to sparse coding fail to consider the geometrical structure of the data space. In many real applications, the data is more likely to reside on a low-dimensional submanifold embedded in the high-dimensional ambient space. It has been shown that the geometrical information of the data is important for discrimination. In this paper, we propose a graph based algorithm, called graph regularized sparse coding, to learn the sparse representations that explicitly take into account the local manifold structure of the data. By using graph Laplacian as a smooth operator, the obtained sparse representations vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold.

        "abstract": "Topic modeling is a powerful tool for discovering the underlying or hidden structure in text corpora. Typical algorithms for topic modeling include probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Despite their different inspirations, both approaches are instances of generative model, whereas the discriminative structure of the documents is ignored. In this paper, we propose locally discriminative topic model (LDTM), a novel topic modeling approach which considers both generative and discriminative structures of the data space. Different from PLSA and LDA in which the topic distribution of a document is dependent on all the other documents, LDTM takes a local perspective that the topic distribution of each document is strongly dependent on its neighbors. By modeling the local relationships of documents within each neighborhood via a local linear model, we learn topic distributions that vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold, and can better capture the discriminative structure in the data. The experimental results on text clustering and web page categorization demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

Compared with traditional Internet services, there is much more personalized information in blogspace. And it is an ideal place to provide personalized services such as recommendation. This paper proposes a novel scheme to model users' interests for recommendation in blogspace. It separates users' interests into long-term and short-term, and models them by integrating their preference categories reflected in individual blog post in a period of time. Interests attenuation algorithm is further introduced to model the decline of users' interests in a specific category. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can well describe users' interests evolvement.",

        "abstract": "The phenomenon of propagation is universal in our daily life. For example, infectious diseases can be transmitted from one person to another, hot news is disseminated widely on the Internet, and classic passages written by the popular users can be shared by many other users in online social network sites. With the emerging of online social network sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Flickr, many literatures try to analyse patterns of information propagation and design effective virtual marketing strategies in these sites. However, few metrics have been designed to measure the characteristic of information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel metric for measuring members' contribution to information propagation in online social network sites. As a case, we analyse large-scale traces of members' contribution to photo dissemination in Flickr and find that the distribution of members' contribution follows a power law distribution, which reveals that most of the information is created and propagated by a few members.",

We propose a hybrid news recommending strategy considering not only the user's listening history, but also taking the user's neighbors with similar tastes and preferences into account. It can track multiple threads of user's interests and the diversity of recommended news list is also guaranteed.

        "abstract": "Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) has become one of the most active research areas in computer science. Relevance feedback is often used in CBIR systems to bridge the semantic gap. Typically, users are asked to make relevance judgements on some query results, and the feedback information is then used to re-rank the images in the database. An effective relevance feedback algorithm must provide the users with the most informative images with respect to the ranking function. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Convex Laplacian Regularized Ioptimal Design (CLapRID), for relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on a regression model which minimizes the least square error on the labeled images and simultaneously preserves the intrinsic geometrical structure of the image space. It selects the most informative images which minimize the average predictive variance. The optimization problem of CLapRID can be cast as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, and solved via interior-point methods. Experimental results on COREL database have demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for relevance feedback image retrieval.",

        "title": "Discriminative codeword selection for image representation",
        "abstract": "Bag of features (BoF) representation has attracted an increasing amount of attention in large scale image processing systems. BoF representation treats images as loose collections of local invariant descriptors extracted from them. The visual codebook is generally constructed by using an unsupervised algorithm such as K-means to quantize the local descriptors into clusters. Images are then represented by the frequency histograms of the codewords contained in them. To build a compact and discriminative codebook, codeword selection has become an indispensable tool. However, most of the existing codeword selection algorithms are supervised and the human labeling may be very expensive. In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised codeword selection, and propose a novel algorithm called Discriminative Codeword Selection (DCS). Motivated from recent studies on discriminative clustering, the central idea of our proposed algorithm is to select those codewords so that the cluster structure of the image database can be best respected. Specifically, a multi-output linear function is fitted to model the relationship between the data matrix after codeword selection and the indicator matrix. The most discriminative codewords are thus defined as those leading to minimal fitting error. Experiments on image retrieval and clustering have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Ubiquitous data are increasingly expanding in large volumes due to human activities, and grouping them into appropriate clusters is an important and yet challenging problem. Existing matrix factorization techniques have shown their significant power in solving this problem, e.g., nonnegative matrix factorization, concept factorization. Recently, one state-of-the-art method called locality-constrained concept factorization is put forward, but its locality constraint does not well reveal the intrinsic data structure since it only requires the concept to be as close to the original data points as possible. To address this issue, we present a graph-based local concept coordinate factorization (GLCF) method, which respects the intrinsic structure of the data through manifold kernel learning in the warped Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Besides, a generalized update algorithm is developed to handle data matrices containing both positive and negative entries. Since GLCF is essentially based on the local coordinate coding and concept factorization, it inherits many advantageous properties, such as the locality and sparsity of the data representation. Moreover, it can better encode the locally geometrical structure via graph Laplacian in the manifold adaptive kernel. Therefore, a more compact and better structured representation can be obtained in the low-dimensional data space. Extensive experiments on several image and gene expression databases suggest the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with some alternatives.",

In this paper, we proposea novel feature selection (FSalgorithm to filter out the low efficiency features towards fast speech emotion recognition.Firstly, each acoustic feature's discriminative ability, time consumption and redundancy are calculated. Then, we map the original feature space into a nonlinear one to select nonlinear features,which can exploit the underlying relationship among the original features. Thirdly, high discriminative nonlinear feature with low time consumption is initially preserved. Finally, a further selection is followed to obtain low redundant features based on these preserved features. The final selected nonlinear features are used in features' extraction and features' classification in our approach, we call them qualified features. The experimental results demonstrate that recognition time consumption can be dramatically reduced in not only the extraction phase but also the classification phase.

In this paper, we illustrate an intrinsic connection between these two concepts by showing that the dynamic regret can be expressed in terms of the adaptive regret and the functional variation. This observation implies that strongly adaptive algorithms can be directly leveraged to minimize the dynamic regret. As a result, we present a series of strongly adaptive algorithms whose dynamic regrets are minimax optimal for convex functions, exponentially concave functions, and strongly convex functions, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such kind of dynamic regret bound is established for exponentially concave functions. Moreover, all of those adaptive algorithms do not need any prior knowledge of the functional variation, which is a significant advantage over previous specialized methods for minimizing dynamic regret.",

        "abstract": "Learning with streaming data has attracted much attention during the past few years.Though most studies consider data stream with fixed features, in real practice the features may be evolvable. For example, features of data gathered by limited lifespan sensors will change when these sensors are substituted by new ones. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm: Feature Evolvable Streaming Learning where old features would vanish and new features would occur. Rather than relying on only the current features, we attempt to recover the vanished features and exploit it to improve performance. Specifically, we learn two models from the recovered features and the current features, respectively. To benefit from the recovered features, we develop two ensemble methods. In the first method, we combine the predictions from two models and theoretically show that with the assistance of old features, the performance on new features can be improved. In the second approach, we dynamically select the best single prediction and establish a better performance guarantee when the best model switches. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of our proposal.",

Different from previous studies that use the squared loss to measure the performance, we choose the absolute loss, which is more robust in the presence of large prediction errors. To address the challenge that both the input and output could be heavy-tailed, we propose a truncated minimization problem, and demonstrate that it enjoys an O(\u221ad/n) excess risk, where d is the dimensionality and n is the number of samples. Compared with traditional work on l1-regression, the main advantage of our result is that we achieve a high-probability risk bound without exponential moment conditions on the input and output. Furthermore, if the input is bounded, we show that the classical empirical risk minimization is competent for l1-regression even when the output is heavy-tailed.",

Our regret bounds are comparable to existing results in the worst case, and become much tighter when the comparator has a small loss.",

        "abstract": "Feature space can change or evolve when learning with streaming data. Several recent works have studied feature evolvable learning. They usually assume that features would not vanish or appear in an arbitrary way. For example, when knowing the battery lifespan, old features and new features represented by data gathered by sensors will disappear and emerge at the same time along with the sensors exchanging simultaneously. However, different sensors would have different lifespans, and thus the feature evolution can be unpredictable. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: Prediction with Unpredictable Feature Evolution (PUFE). We first complete the unpredictable overlapping period into an organized matrix and give a theoretical bound on the least number of observed entries. Then we learn the mapping from the completed matrix to recover the data from old feature space when observing the data from new feature space. With predictions on the recovered data, our model can make use of the advantage of old feature space and is always comparable with any combinations of the predictions on the current instance. Experiments on the synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic approximation (SA) is a classical approach for stochastic convex optimization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of SA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity condition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $lambda$ be the modulus of strong convexity, $kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk, and $alphau003e1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in expectation, an $O(1/[lambda T^alpha] + kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is attainable when $T = Omega(kappa^alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[lambda T])$ and approaches $O(1/[lambda T^alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching $O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address learning problems for high dimensional data. Previously, oblivious random projection based approaches that project high dimensional features onto a random subspace have been used in practice for tackling high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. Recently, various non-oblivious randomized reduction methods have been developed and deployed for solving many numerical problems such as matrix product approximation, low-rank matrix approximation, etc. However, they are less explored for the machine learning tasks, e.g., classification. More seriously, the theoretical analysis of excess risk bounds for risk minimization, an important measure of generalization performance, has not been established for non-oblivious randomized reduction methods. It therefore remains an open problem what is the benefit of using them over previous oblivious random projection based approaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework for employing non-oblivious randomized reduction method for general empirical risk minimizing in machine learning tasks, where the original high-dimensional features are projected onto a random subspace that is derived from the data with a small matrix approximation error. We then derive the first excess risk bound for the proposed non-oblivious randomized reduction approach without requiring strong assumptions on the training data. The established excess risk bound exhibits that the proposed approach provides much better generalization performance and it also sheds more insights about different randomized reduction approaches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, whose dimension scales to $O(10^7)$, to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Although there exist plentiful theories of empirical risk minimization (ERM) for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM for a related problem---stochastic convex optimization (SCO), are limited. In this work, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and strong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an $widetilde{O}(d/n + sqrt{F_*/n})$ risk bound when the random function is nonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz continuous, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number of samples, and $F_*$ is the minimal risk. Thus, when $F_*$ is small we obtain an $widetilde{O}(d/n)$ risk bound, which is analogous to the $widetilde{O}(1/n)$ optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning. Second, if the objective function is also $lambda$-strongly convex, we prove an $widetilde{O}(d/n + kappa F_*/n )$ risk bound where $kappa$ is the condition number, and improve it to $O(1/[lambda n^2] + kappa F_*/n)$ when $n=widetilde{Omega}(kappa d)$. As a result, we obtain an $O(kappa/n^2)$ risk bound under the condition that $n$ is large and $F_*$ is small, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first $O(1/n^2)$-type of risk bound of ERM. Third, we stress that the above results are established in a unified framework, which allows us to derive new risk bounds under weaker conditions, e.g., without convexity of the random function and Lipschitz continuity of the expected function. Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an $O(1/[lambda n^2] + kappa F_*/n)$ risk bound for supervised learning, the $widetilde{Omega}(kappa d)$ requirement on $n$ can be replaced with $Omega(kappa^2)$, which is dimensionality-independent.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on convex constrained optimization problems, where the solution is subject to a convex inequality constraint. In particular, we aim at challenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and a linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a. the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization with improved convergence rates. We first present a general theory of optimization with only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one projection yields $O(1/epsilon)$ iteration complexity, which can be further reduced under strong convexity and improves over the $O(1/epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity established before for non-smooth optimization. Then we introduce the local error bound condition and develop faster convergent algorithms for non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of projections. In particular, we achieve a convergence rate of $widetilde O(1/epsilon^{2(1-theta)})$ for non-smooth optimization and $widetilde O(1/epsilon^{1-theta})$ for smooth optimization, where $thetain(0,1]$ is a constant in the local error bound condition. An experiment on solving the constrained $ell_1$ minimization problem in compressive sensing demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieve significant speed-up.",

Given a target level for the excess risk, an interesting question to ask is how many examples and how large the support set of the solution are enough for learning a good model with the target excess risk. To answer these questions, we present a two-stage algorithm that (i) in the first stage an epoch based stochastic optimization algorithm is exploited with an established O(1/ ) bound on the sample complexity; and (ii) in the second stage a distribution dependent randomized sparsification is presented with anO(1/ ) bound on the sparsity (referred to as support complexity) of the resulting model.

Although the Nystrom approximation has been studied extensively and its application to kernel classification has been exhibited in several studies, there still exists a potentially large gap between the performance of classifier learned with the Nystrom approximation and that learned with the original kernel. In this work, we make novel contributions to bridge the gap without increasing the training costs too much by proposing a refined Nystrom based kernel classifier. We adopt a two-step approach that in the first step we learn a sufficiently good dual solution and in the second step we use the obtained dual solution to construct a new set of bases for the Nystrom approximation to re-train a refined classifier. Our approach towards learning a good dual solution is based on a sparse-regularized dual formulation with the Nystrom approximation, which can be solved with the same time complexity as solving the standard formulation. We justify our approach by establishing a theoretical guarantee on the error of the learned dual solution in the first step with respect to the optimal dual solution under appropriate conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that (i) the obtained dual solution by our approach in the first step is closer to the optimal solution and yields improved prediction performance; and (ii) the second step using the obtained dual solution to re-train the model further improves the performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider matrix completion from non-uniformly sampled entries including fully observed and partially observed columns. Specifically, we assume that a small number of columns are randomly selected and fully observed, and each remaining column is partially observed with uniform sampling. To recover the unknown matrix, we first recover its column space from the fully observed columns. Then, for each partially observed column, we recover it by finding a vector which lies in the recovered column space and consists of the observed entries. When the unknown $mtimes n$ matrix is low-rank, we show that our algorithm can exactly recover it from merely $Omega(rnln n)$ entries, where $r$ is the rank of the matrix. Furthermore, for a noisy low-rank matrix, our algorithm computes a low-rank approximation of the unknown matrix and enjoys an additive error bound measured by Frobenius norm. Experimental results on synthetic datasets verify our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) as a popular machine learning model is found to be vulnerable to adversarial attack. This attack constructs adversarial examples by adding small perturbations to the raw input, while appearing unmodified to human eyes but will be misclassified by a well-trained classifier. In this paper, we focus on the black-box attack setting where attackers have almost no access to the underlying models. To conduct black-box attack, a popular approach aims to train a substitute model based on the information queried from the target DNN. The substitute model can then be attacked using existing white-box attack approaches, and the generated adversarial examples will be used to attack the target DNN. Despite its encouraging results, this approach suffers from poor query efficiency, i.e., attackers usually needs to query a huge amount of times to collect enough information for training an accurate substitute model. To this end, we first utilize state-of-the-art white-box attack methods to generate samples for querying, and then introduce an active learning strategy to significantly reduce the number of queries needed. Besides, we also propose a diversity criterion to avoid the sampling bias. Our extensive experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed method can reduce more than 90% of queries while preserve attacking success rates and obtain an accurate substitute model which is more than 85% similar with the target oracle.",

        "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have documented that, the increase of anti-cardiolipin (aCL) antibody titer has an obvious positive relationship with the vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and repeated abortion in the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome, but there is little information on the aCL antibodies in lupus nephritis (LN). Objective: To ascertain the prevalence and significance of aCL antibodies in Chinese patients with LN. Design: Prospective follow-up study of one sample. Setting: Department of Rheumatology in Xiangmihu Branch of Shenzhen Fourth People's Hospital, Shenzhen Institute of Rheumatology in Guangdong Medical College. Participants: The study was performed in 97 LN patients consecutively recruited in the Department of Rheumatology in Xiangmihu Branch of Shenzhen Fourth People's Hospital between March 2001 and October 2003. All the included patients met the revised criteria of American College of Rheumatology for the diagnosis and classification of LN. And they all knew the fact saying yes. Methods: The clinical data and auxiliary examination result were recorded when hospitalization. The aCL antibodies were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and were considered as positive if over 100 U/mL. High-dose oral administration of prednisone combined with cyclophosphamide intravenous pulse therapy were applied for inducing release. The curative effect was remained by using azathioprine and prednisone at a decreasing dose. Meanwhile the complications such as hypertension, hyperlipemia and arthralgia were prevented by drugs. All the patients had routine visits at six-month intervals for a total of 3 years. Clinical and serologic manifestations of patients with LN were tested and recorded regularly. Main outcome measures: Gender, age, systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index, clinical manifestations, vascular thrombosis, pregnancy outcome and renal function. Results: All the 97 LN patients were included in the study, and 83 of them entered the result analysis while the other 14 cases were lost. The overall prevalence of aCL antibodies in 97 subjects was 39% (38 cases). Hypertension, thrombocytopenia and Raynaud's phenomenon were more frequent in LN patients with aCL antibodies. The aCL IgG antibody-positive patients showed a greater risk for the occurrence of vascular thrombosis; Pregnancy morbidity of miscarriages, premature birth, fetal death and the probability of developing irreversible renal function deterioration occurred at a greater frequency in aCL antibody-positive patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of aCL antibodies in LN patients is 39%. A higher incidence of hypertension, thrombocytopenia and Raynaud's phenomenon is found in patients with aCL antibodies. Detection of aCL antibodies in patients with LN may be useful to predict the development of vascular thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity and irreversible chronic renal function deterioration.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Chrysin,a dietary flavonoid or natural product,widely distributed in health food and Chinese herbal medicine,has promising cancer-preventive and cancer-therapeutic activities.Some problems remain poorly understood:whether chrysin is beneficial to liver cancer prevention and treatment? What are the underlying mechanisms? Whether chrysin promotes the differentiation of liver cancer stem cells? OBJECTIVE:By using human hepatocellular carcinoma cells as the subject,the study aimed to uncover the subcellular and molecular mechanisms of actions for chrysin.METHODS:The acid phosphatase assay,scanning electron microscopy and immunoblotting were used to investigate the effects of chrysin on the BEL-7402 cells,and to reveal the underlying anticancer mechanisms.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:Chrysin has potent antiproliferative activity against cultured BEL-7402 cells,with an IC50 of 24.9 mol/L or 6.3 g/mL.When administered together with LY294002,a specific inhibitor of the PI3K-AKT pathway,chrysin cooperatively and significantly augmented the anticancer effect.However,chrysin alone did not lead to changes in the expression levels of AKT,phosphorylated AKT,and AKT's downstream molecule GSK-3 and phospho-GSK-3,though \u03b2-catenin reduced slightly under a higher dosage.In chrysin-treated cells,the density of the microvillus-like protrusions on the cell surfaces was drastically increased;Membrane nanoparticles were emerging from the protrusions.Cells were severely retracted,leaving wide gaps between cultured cells.There were also dying or dead cells that were morphologically different from apoptotic cells.Numerous phospho-Ser/Thr bands were changed in chrysin-treated cells.Chrysin also caused extensive dephosphorylation of tyrosine on proteins,which was also seen in positive control or epirubicin-treated cells.No significant changes were observed in the levels of CDK1,phospho-CDK1/2,CDC25A,CDC25B and CD133.However,dose-dependent induction of PARP-1 fragmentation was observed upon chrysin treatment.Taken together,the antiproliferative effect of chrysin on the BEL-7402 cells was not resulted from blocking of the PI3K-AKT or Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway,nor from blocking of the key regulatory factors in cell cycle,but was likely resulted from ultrastructural alterations on the cell surfaces due to malfunction of biomembranes,and widespread modifications of protein phosphorylation.As a consequence,non-classical cell death was likely induced in chrysin-treated liver cancer cells.",

In particular, a unified classification of efficiency of energy systems, namely performance efficiency, operation efficiency, equipment efficiency and technology efficiency (POET), is reviewed and further discussed to facilitate effective use of DSM methods in a selection of energy-intensive industrial processes. The operational level efficiency improvement is then focused on and the corresponding modelling and control by model predictive control (MPC) approach are presented. The modelling process is generalised to cater for a number of industrial processes. Robustness and convergence of MPC method when applied to periodic industrial processes are elaborated. The relationship between control and the POET is outlined thereafter to link the two such that one can make use of the POET concept to guide the controller design. Finally, case studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches presented.",

A two-stage coordinated approach is proposed. Firstly, the feeder capacitor dispatch schedule is determined based on reactive power heuristics. Then, an optimisation model is applied to determine the dispatch schedule of the substation devices taking into account the control actions of the feeder capacitors. The reference voltage of the substation secondary bus and the tap position limits of transformers are modified such that the model adapts to varying load conditions. The optimisation model is solved with a modified particle swarm optimisation algorithm. The proposed method is compared with conventional volt/var control strategies using a 14-bus system and its effectiveness is further illustrated on a 69-bus system. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach performs better than the conventional strategies in terms of voltage deviation and energy loss minimisation.",

        "abstract": "The management of energy-water nexus in buildings is increasingly gaining attention among domestic end-users. In developing countries, potable water supply is unreliable due to increasing demand, forcing end-users to seek alternative strategies such as pumping and storage in rooftop tanks to reliably meet their water demand. However, this is at an increased cost of energy cost. In this paper, the open loop optimal control model and the closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) model, both with disturbances, are compared while minimizing the maintenance cost of the pump. The open loop optimal model is suitable in instances where only random disturbances due to measurement errors are present. However, in case the demand pattern changes for reasons such as occupancy change in the house, the closed-loop MPC model is suitable as it robustly minimizes the pumping cost while meeting the customer demand. Further, MPC proves its robustness as it is able to overcome the turnpike phenomenon. Each of these two models has their own strengths. The open loop model is cost effective and easy to implement for customers that have a steady demand pattern while the closed-loop MPC model is more robust against demand pattern changes and external disturbances. It is recommended that these two models are adopted according to the specific application.",

In order to assist decision-makers with the appropriate selection of facilities, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization model aiming at optimizing the retrofitting costs, energy savings, water savings, payback period, and points earned under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. This work introduces green building certification as an objective for existing building retrofits. The benefits of an existing building retrofit and green building certification to the building owner includes reduced operating costs, carbon footprint, and improved air quality. The developed model considers a wide range of facilities and saving measures as retrofitting options for the energy and water efficiency credit categories of LEED. A case study of a hotel in South Africa is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model and optimization approach.",

        "abstract": "This study looks into the power flow control of a battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system when applied to electric vehicles. The controller is based on advanced model predictive control method and aims at smoothing the power flow from/to the battery to protect it from undesirable fast discharging/charging. The second objective of the controller is to control the electric vehicle to track a predefined speed profile. The dynamics of the vehicle and the supercapacitors are modeled from first principles to facilitate the controller design. It is assumed that the battery, as the primary energy source for the vehicle, is properly sized such that there is no need to control its state-of-charge. In addition, the controller is designed at the energy management level instead of power electronics control level. Therefore, it severs to optimize the power flows of the hybrid energy storage system instead of controlling the power converters involved. Simulations based on two commonly used urban driving cycles are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the design.",

The ESSs with only supercapacitors (SCs) or high performance batteries (hpBs) have egregious limitations, and are unable to meet up the demands for specific power and energy concurrently. This study reports on the design and characterization of asymmetric supercapacitor based on activated carbon (ACC) and MoS 2  that suitable for use in hybrid energy storage systems in electric vehicles. The contribution of the double storage mechanism processes obtained from the faradaic storage sulfide material (MoS 2 ) combined with the excellent electric double layer storage from the activated carbon led to the overall realization of an specific energy of ~ 27.82 Wh kg -1  with a related specific power of 1000 W kg -1  at a 0.5 A g -1  gravimetric current density. In addition, the device also exhibited a 100% coulombic efficiency even after cycling for 10,000 continuous charge-discharge cycles serving as the highest reported presently on this device type. This shows the unique potential of adopting such ACC/MoS 2  materials as exceptional candidates to act as SC cells in the hybrid system for energy storage in electric vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Among the various types of belt conveyors, the multi-drive technology has gained worldwide popularity in recent years because of the cost saving opportunities as a result of the possible reduction of the belt weight. Until recently, however, limited knowledge on the cost-effective design of such conveyor systems was reported in the literature. Following the findings of a novel contribution on this matter, this paper presents a comparative numerical study for the identification of the most advantageous belt conveyor design for a specific bulk material handling application. Three types of belt conveyor are compared: the single drive belt conveyor, the single-tandem drive belt conveyor and the multi-drive belt conveyor. Subject to the assumption made and the manufacturers supplied information, the study shows that the implementation of the most cost-effective multi-drive conveyor will result in equivalent annual cost savings of about 63,120 $(USD) and 29,475 $(USD) over the cheapest single drive and single-tandem drive contenders, respectively. Other economic and environmental spin-off effects are also evaluated in the paper.",

Lower greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased durability of vehicle engines are the main properties of CNG that make it a better alternative to petrol and diesel. CNG refueling infrastructure is vital to the expansion of consumer adoption of CNG vehicles. The economical operation of CNG fueling stations is beneficial to the station operators and consumers, by reducing cost of fuel delivery. The present study is concerned with the optimal scheduling of compressor operation in a CNG fueling station to achieve reduced cost of energy in a time-of-use electricity tariff environment. The cascade fast fill station is modelled as a single storage mass flow system with storage refilling optimally controlled to achieve minimum cost of electricity in supplying a typical day gas demand profile. The open loop optimization strategy shows the potential to achieve savings of 59.28% in cost of electricity for operating the compressor, while also minimizing compressor wear and tear.",

The growth of compressed natural gas as an alternative fuel to petrol and diesel can be accelerated by implementing strategies that result in the economical operation of the distribution infrastructure. Economic scheduling of power consumption is a useful strategy for reducing the cost of energy for both industrial and domestic consumers who operate in time-of-use based electricity pricing environments. In this paper, an optimal energy management strategy is proposed for the operation of a compressed natural gas fuelling station. The compressor energy consumption, being the main component of the total operating cost of the fuelling station, presents a cost saving opportunity through which optimal scheduling of operation can be used to lower cost of operation of the station. The developed model shows potential average savings of 59.3% in daily electricity costs while maximizing compressor life through minimization of compressor cycling.",

Based on this model, the resistance of the electrolyte, membrane, current collectors and active materials have effects on the first intersection points on the real axis (x-axis) of the Nyquist plots (equivalent series resistance (ESR)). These results indicate inward shrinking of the cyclic voltammograms (CV) due to a small change in the leakage resistance and resistance of the faradic component of materials, and they also explain the parameters that lead to the deformation of the CV from ideal behaviour. The 3D model was verified with experiments using activated carbon-based SC devices.

        "abstract": "Abstract   A Organic Rankine Cycle waste heat recovery cogeneration system for heat recovery and power generation to relieve grid pressure and save energy cost for a ferrochrome smelting plant is investigated. Through the recovery and utilization of previously wasted heat from the facility\u2019s internal smelting process off-gases, the cogeneration system is introduced to generate electrical power to supply the on-site electricity demand and feed electricity back to the utility grid when it is necessary and beneficial to do so. In addition, the cogeneration system generates cooling power through a lithium bromide-water solution absorption refrigeration cycle to meet the cooling requirements of the plant. The heat recovery process for power generation is modeled and the optimal power dispatching between the on-site loads and the utility grid is formulated as an economic power dispatching (EPD) problem, which aims to maximize the plant\u2019s economic benefits by means of minimizing the cost of purchasing electricity from the utility and maximizing revenue from selling the generated electricity to the grid. Application of the developed model to a ferrochrome smelting plant in South Africa is presented as a case study. It is found that, for the studied case, more than $1,290,000 annual savings can be obtained as a result of the proposed heat recovery power generation system and the associated EPD model. In addition to this, more than $920,000 annual savings is obtained as a result of the generated cooling power via the proposed absorption refrigeration system. The combined cogeneration system is able to generate up to 4.4\u00a0MW electrical power and 11.3\u00a0MW cooling power from the recovered thermal energy that was previously wasted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A bottoming and organic rankine cycle cogeneration system for heat recovery and power generation for a South African smelter is studied. The goal is to investigate the potential benefits of generating electrical power from the process waste heat to supply its on-site loads and feed the generated electricity to utility grid when it is beneficial to do so. To achieve this, an economic power dispatch (EPD) model is developed to optimally manage the power flows to the on-site loads and that to the utility grid. The heat recovery process for power generation is modeled first to facilitate the development of the EPD model that maximizes the plantu0027s economic benefits in terms of minimizing electricity cost and maximizing revenue from selling the generated electricity. The potential of generating cooling power through a lithium bromide-water solution absorption refrigeration cycle is also investigated and the economic benefits of the proposed system, when operated by the EPD model designed, are also studied.",

To operate the upgraded energy system, either without or with little modifications of the pre-existing architecture, an additional control layer is applied at the bottom of the original control system. Considering the complementary characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors, the design of the new model predictive control layer and its coordination with the original one help to deliver a stable power flow between the hybrid renewable system and the utility grid, and remove fast variations from the battery power. Actual measurements of solar radiation in South Africa are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Simulations carried out on a 1-MW photovoltaic plant confirm the benefits in terms of adherence to power quality regulations, improved conditioning of the power generated by the intermittent renewable sources, and lifetime extension of the battery.",

Furthermore, the energy intensities of the different university residences are evaluated and compared. The results of the study revealed correlation between energy usage and temperature (heating degree days and cooling degree days) for all the residences, while benchmarking revealed a significant difference in the energy consumption. In particular, the results showed a 34.6% difference between the energy usage of the two universities, highlighting a significantly higher use in the University of Pretoria\u2019s residences. Finally, an analysis of the average daily profiles and a walk through revealed possible opportunities for energy saving interventions.",

        "abstract": "Owing to low efficiency of traditional ships and the serious environmental pollution that they cause, the use of solar energy and an energy storage system (ESS) in a ship\u2019s power system is increasingly attracting attention. However, the swinging of a ship raises crucial challenges in designing an optimal system for a large oil tanker ship, which are associated with uncertainties in solar energy. In this study, a series of experiments are performed to investigate the characteristics of a photovoltaic (PV) system on a moving ship. Based on the experimental results, an interval uncertainty model of on-board PV generation is established, which considers the effect of the swinging of the ship. Due to the power balance equations, the outputs of the diesel generator and the ESS on a large oil tanker are also modeled using interval variables. An interval optimization method is developed to determine the optimal size of the ESS in this hybrid ship power system to reduce the fuel cost, capital cost of the ESS, and emissions of greenhouse gases. Variations of the ship load are analyzed using a new method, taking five operating conditions into account. Several cases are compared in detail to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

The energy is only 9\u2009meV/atom above the tie line between SnSe and SnSe2. Sn charge disproportionation is only marginally favored in this selenide, in contrast to sulfides. This leads to a semimetallic rather than semiconducting behavior. These findings, marginal stability of the crystalline phase and conducting character and close competition of disproportionated and non-disproportionated structures, are important for understanding the behavior of Sn2Se3 as a phase change memory material, specifically the fast low energy, the low temperature switching, and the high resistance contrast.",

These materials not only exhibit unprecedented performance in some cases, but they also appear to break new ground with their unexpected properties, such as extreme tolerance to defects. However, because of the relatively recent emergence of this class of materials, there remain many yet to be fully explored compounds. Here, we assess a series of bismuth/antimony oxyhalides and chalcohalides using consistent first principles methods to ascertain their properties and obtain trends. Based on these calculations, we identify a subset consisting of three types of compounds that may be promising as solar absorbers, transparent conductors, and radiation detectors. Their electronic structure, connection to the crystal geometry, and impact on band-edge dispersion and carrier effective mass are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Oxides with good p-type conductivity have been long sought after to achieve high performance all-oxide optoelectronic devices. Divalent Sn(II) based oxides are promising candidates because of their rather dispersive upper valence bands caused by the Sn-5s/O-2p anti-bonding hybridization. There are so far few known Sn(II) oxides being p-type conductive suitable for device applications. Here, we present via first-principles global optimization structure searches a material design study for a hitherto unexplored Sn(II)-based system, ternary alkaline-earth metal Sn(II) oxides in the stoichiometry of MSn2O3 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). We identify two stable compounds of SrSn2O3 and BaSn2O3, which can be stabilized by Sn-rich conditions in phase stability diagrams. Their structures follow the Zintl behaviour and consist of basic structural motifs of SnO3 tetrahedra. Unexpectedly they show distinct electronic properties with band gaps ranging from 1.90 (BaSn2O3) to 3.15 (SrSn2O3) eV, and hole effective masses ranging from 0.87 (BaSn2O3) to above 6.0 (SrSn2O3) m0. Further exploration of metastable phases indicates a wide tunability of electronic properties controlled by the details of the bonding between the basic structural motifs. This suggests further exploration of alkaline-earth metal Sn(II) oxides for potential applications requiring good p-type conductivity such as transparent conductors and photovoltaic absorbers.",

We focus on known prototype materials SnnP2O5+n (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) and a previously unreported compound, SnP2O6 (n = 1), which we find using global optimization structure prediction. The electronic structure calculations indicate that these compounds all have large band gaps above 3.2 eV, meaning they are transparent with visible light. Several of these compounds show relatively low hole effective masses (\u223c2\u20133 m0), comparable the electron masses. This suggests potential bipolar conductivity depending on doping. The dispersive valence band-edges, underlying the low hole masses, originate from the antibonding hybridization between the Sn 5s orbitals and the phosphate groups. Analysis of structure\u2013property relationships for the metastable structures generated during the structure search shows considerable variation in combinations of band gap and carrier effective masses, implying chemical tunability...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Polymer carbon nitrides (PCN) are one of promising photocatalysts in water splitting, but their low crystallinity usually leads to slow transfer efficiency of charge carriers. Herein, we presented a solid-salt-assisted growth strategy to fabricate highly crystalline polymer carbon nitride (CPCN). The high-melting-point KCl salt was used as an easily removable solid template, where the confined space guides efficient growth of CPCN. The fabricated CPCN samples show high crystalline quality with clear long-range periodicity and large grain sizes up to 400\u2009nm. The combination of structural characterization analyses and first-principles energetic calculations reveals that CPCN is composed of chain-like melon motifs with intercalated K +  ions. The photocatalytic activity of CPCN in hydrogen evolution reaction is over 22 times higher than that of pristine PCN, the apparent quantum efficiency at \u03bb\u2009=\u2009420\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009nm is up to 11.4%. This work provides a simple and general protocol for crystallinity and performance enhancement in a wide range of polymeric photocatalyst materials.",

        "abstract": "Covalent-polar semiconductors that show intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) vertical polarization present new device opportunities. These materials differ from ordinary ferroelectrics in that they are able to maintain polarization normal to a surface even with an unscreened depolarization field. Identifying phases that exhibit intrinsic 2D vertical polarization is an ongoing challenge. Here we report via computational material design the discovery of a new promising phase, specifically 2D LiAlTe$_2$. The design idea is developed from the physical understanding of three-dimensional hyperferroelectric covalent polar semiconductors. We used the structure determination method combining swarm intelligence algorithm and first-principles calculations to identify energetically stable structures. In addition to the expected layered version of bulk LiAlTe$_2$, $beta$-LiAlTe$_2$, we find a novel 2D structure, $gamma$-LiAlTe$_2$. In this phase, the vertical dipole can be switched between 0.07 and -0.11 e$cdot$angstrom. This switching is triggered by the movement of Li atom between two local energy minima. The associated asymmetric double-well energy profile can be continuously tuned by the applied electric field as well as strain. There is, therefore, a reversible transition between two polar states. This discovered off-plane switchability provides an opportunity for the 2D $gamma$-LiAlTe$_2$ based interfacial phase change memory device for example by growing $gamma$-LiAlTe$_2$/GeTe heterostructures.",

A ternary nanoporous sulfur doped copper oxide (Cu2OxS1-x) was successfully synthesized on Cu foam. The obtained Cu2OxS1-x/Cu shows robust electrocatalytic activity towards HER with a low overpotential of 40 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec-1, and exhibits long-term stability in acid solution. Moreover, the Cu2OxS1-x shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER, HER, and overall water splitting as a bifunctional catalyst in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The sulfur doping strategy implemented here can greatly improve the catalytic performance and stability in both acidic and alkaline water electrolyzers and presents an efficient catalyst for overall water splitting.",

The intriguingly high dependence of the band gap on layer thickness may lead to novel device applications, although its origin remains poorly understood, and is generally attributed to the quantum confinement effect. In this work, we demonstrate via first-principles calculations that strong interlayer coupling may be mainly responsible for this phenomenon, especially in the fewer-layer region, and it could also be an essential factor influencing other material properties of \u03b2-InSe and \u03b3-InSe. The existence of strong interlayer coupling manifests itself in three aspects: (i) indirect-to-direct band gap transitions with increasing layer thickness; (ii) fan-like frequency diagrams of the shear and breathing modes of few-layer flakes; and (iii) strong layer-dependent carrier mobilities. Our results indicate that multiple-layer InSe may be deserving of attention from FET-based technologies and may also be an ideal system to study interlayer coupling, possibly inherent in other 2D materials.",

Favorable improvements in thermal conductivity are attainable in many material systems, and theoretical work points to large improvements in electronic properties. However, realization of the electronic benefits in practical materials has been elusive experimentally. A key challenge is that experimental identification of the quantum confinement length, below which the thermoelectric power factor is significantly enhanced, remains elusive due to lack of simultaneous control of size and carrier density. Here we investigate gate-tunable and temperature-dependent thermoelectric transport in \u03b3-phase indium selenide (\u03b3-InSe, n-type semiconductor) samples with thickness varying from 7 to 29 nm. This allows us to properly map out dimension and doping space. Combining theoretical and experimental studies, we reveal that the sharper pre-edge of the conduction-band density of states arising from quantum confinement gives rise to an enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the power factor in the thinner InSe samples. Most importantly, we experimentally identify the role of the competition between quantum confinement length and thermal de Broglie wavelength in the enhancement of power factor. Our results provide an important and general experimental guideline for optimizing the power factor and improving the thermoelectric performance of two-dimensional layered semiconductors.",

Although fluorescence techniques using dye molecule labels have been studied, label-free molecular-level quantification of miRNA is extremely challenging. We developed a surface plasmon resonance sensor based on two-dimensional nanomaterial of antimonene for the specific label-free detection of clinically relevant biomarkers such as miRNA-21 and miRNA-155. First-principles energetic calculations reveal that antimonene has substantially stronger interaction with ssDNA than the graphene that has been previously used in DNA molecule sensing, due to thanking for more delocalized 5s/5p orbitals in antimonene. The detection limit can reach 10 aM, which is 2.3-10,000 times higher than those of existing miRNA sensors. The combination of not-attempted-before exotic sensing material and SPR architecture represents an approach to unlocking the ultrasensitive detection of miRNA and DNA and provides a promising avenue for the early diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of cancer.",

Here we present based on first-principles high-throughput calculations a computational study of carrier effective masses of the two-dimensional MX 2  materials. Both electron and hole effective masses of different MX 2  (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se, Te), including in-layer/out-of-layer components, thickness dependence, and magnitude variation in heterostructures, are systemically calculated.

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) graphene-like layered semiconductors provide a new platform for materials research because of their unique mechanical, electronic and optical attributes. Their in-plane covalent bonding and dangling-bond-free surface allow them to assemble various van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHSs) with sharply atomic interfaces that are not limited by lattice matching and material compatibility. Interlayer coupling, as a ubiquitous phenomenon residing among 2D materials (2DMs) systems, controls a thin layer exfoliation process and the assembly of vdWHSs and behaves with a unique degree of freedom for engineering the properties of 2DMs. Interlayer coupling provides an opportunity to observe new physics and provides a novel strategy to modulate the electronic and optoelectronic properties of materials for practical device applications. We herein review recent progress in the exploration of interlayer coupling in 2D semiconducting vdWHSs for potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics.",

        "abstract": "Tin monosulfide (SnS), which is composed of earth-abundant elements, holds promise as useful high-performance solar absorber and thermoelectric material. In addition to the ground-state Pnma phase, a series of metastable phases in different crystalline structures have been reported experimentally or theoretically, yet the phase stability diagrams remain elusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive materials design study of new phases of SnS using first-principles global optimization structure search calculations. We find that the two-dimensional layered phases are generally more energetically favored than the three-dimensional connected phases. In addition, we discover several new phases with comparable energetics. Four lower-energy phases show clear phonon stabilities evidenced by an absence of imaginary modes. The electronic band structures, carrier transport properties, and absorption spectra of the newly discovered phases are investigated and discussed toward potential applications for solar cells and thermoelectric devices.",

Here we show a reliable and tunable polyoxometalate template-based synthetic strategy to atomically engineer metal doping sites onto metallic 1T-MoS, using Anderson-type polyoxometalates as precursors. Benefiting from engineering nickel and oxygen atoms, the optimized electrocatalyst shows great enhancement in the hydrogen evolution reaction with a positive onset potential of ~\u20090\u2009V and a low overpotential of -46\u2009mV in alkaline electrolyte, comparable to platinum-based catalysts. First-principles calculations reveal co-doping nickel and oxygen into 1T-MoS assists the process of water dissociation and hydrogen generation from their intermediate states. This research will expand on the ability to improve the activities of various catalysts by precisely engineering atomic activation sites to achieve significant electronic modulations and improve atomic utilization efficiencies.",

Single materials with efficient and stable white-light emission are ideal for lighting applications, but photon emission covering the entire visible spectrum is difficult to achieve using a single material. Metal halide perovskites have outstanding emission properties; however, the best-performing materials of this type contain lead and have unsatisfactory stability. Here we report a lead-free double perovskite that exhibits efficient and stable white-light emission via self-trapped excitons that originate from the Jahn-Teller distortion of the AgCl octahedron in the excited state. By alloying sodium cations into CsAgInCl, we break the dark transition (the inversion-symmetry-induced parity-forbidden transition) by manipulating the parity of the wavefunction of the self-trapped exciton and reduce the electronic dimensionality of the semiconductor. This leads to an increase in photoluminescence efficiency by three orders of magnitude compared to pure CsAgInCl. The optimally alloyed Cs(AgNa)InCl with 0.04 per cent bismuth doping emits warm-white light with 86\u2009\u00b1\u20095 per cent quantum efficiency and works for over 1,000 hours. We anticipate that these results will stimulate research on single-emitter-based white-light-emitting phosphors and diodes for next-generation lighting and display technologies.",

        "abstract": "Low-dimensional narrow bandgap III-V semiconductors are key building blocks for the next generation of high-performance nano-electronics, nano-photonics and quantum devices. To realize these various applications, it requires an efficient methodology that enables the material dimensional control during the synthesis process and the mass production of these materials with perfect crystallinity, reproducibility, low cost and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, despite advances in one- and two-dimensional narrow bandgap III-V semiconductors synthesis, the progress towards reliable methods that can satisfy all of these requirements has been limited. Here, we demonstrate an approach that provides a precise control of the dimension of InAs from one-dimensional nanowires to wafer-scale free-standing two-dimensional nanosheets, which have a high degree of crystallinity and outstanding electrical and optical properties, using molecular-beam epitaxy by controlling catalyst alloy segregation. In our approach, two-dimensional InAs nanosheets can be obtained directly from one-dimensional InAs nanowires by silver-indium alloy segregation, which is much easier than previously reported method, such as traditional buffering technique and select area epitaxial growth. Detailed transmission electron microscopy investigations provide a solid evidence that the catalyst alloy segregation is the origination of the InAs dimensional transformation from one-dimensional nanowires to two-dimensional nanosheets, and even to three-dimensional complex crosses. Using this method, we find that the wafer-scale free-standing InAs nanosheets can be grown on various substrates including Si, MgO, sapphire and GaAs etc. The InAs nanosheets grown at high temperature are pure phase single crystals and have a high electron mobility and a long time-resolved THz kinetics lifetime. Our work will open up a conceptually new and general technology route toward the effective controlling the dimension of the low-dimensional III-V semiconductors. It may also enable the low-cost fabrication of free-standing nanosheet-based devices on an industrial scale.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) atomic layered semiconductor ( e.g., transition metal dichalcogenides, TMDCs) heterostructures display diverse novel interfacial carrier properties and have potential applications in constructing next generation highly compact electronics and optoelectronics devices. However, the optoelectronic performance of this kind of semiconductor heterostructures has difficulty reaching the expectations of practical applications, due to the intrinsic weak optical absorption of the atomic-thick component layers. Here, combining the extraordinary optoelectronic properties of quantum-confined organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (PVK), we design an ultrathin PVK/TMDC vertical semiconductor heterostructure configuration and realize the controlled vapor-phase growth of highly crystalline few-nanometer-thick PVK layers on TMDCs monolayers. The achieved ultrathin PVKs show strong thickness-induced quantum confinement effect, and simultaneously form band alignment-engineered heterointerfaces with the underlying TMDCs, resulting in highly efficient interfacial charge separation and transport. Electrical devices constructed with the as-grown ultrathin PVK/WS heterostructures show ambipolar transport originating from p-type PVK and n-type WS, and exhibit outstanding optoelectronic characteristics, with the optimized response time and photoresponsivity reaching 64 \u03bcs and 11174.2 A/W, respectively, both of which are 4 orders of magnitude better than the heterostructures with a thick PVK layer, and also represent the best among all previously reported 2D layered semiconductor heterostructures. This work provides opportunities for 2D vertical semiconductor heterostructures via incorporating ultrathin PVK layers in high-performance integrated optoelectronics.",

However, exploring an effective strategy to further improve their optical activities remains a considerable challenge. Here, we report that nanocrystals (NCs) of the initially nonfluorescent zero-dimensional (0D) cesium lead halide perovskite CsPbBr exhibit a distinct emission under a high pressure of 3.01 GPa. Subsequently, the emission intensity of CsPbBr NCs experiences a significant increase upon further compression. Joint experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that such pressure-induced emission (PIE) may be ascribed to the enhanced optical activity and the increased binding energy of self-trapped excitons upon compression. This phenomenon is a result of the large distortion of [PbBr] octahedral motifs resulting from a structural phase transition. Our findings demonstrate that high pressure can be a robust tool to boost the photoluminescence efficiency and provide insights into the relationship between the structure and optical properties of 0D MHPs under extreme conditions.",

Synchrotron-based x-ray scattering revealed the presence of highly oriented \u03b2-CsPbI grains, and sensitive elemental analyses-including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry-confirmed their all-inorganic composition. We further mitigated the effects of cracks and pinholes in the perovskite layer by surface treating with choline iodide, which increased the charge-carrier lifetime and improved the energy-level alignment between the \u03b2-CsPbI absorber layer and carrier-selective contacts.

However, because of the anion exchange, it is difficult to achieve white-light and multicolor emission for practical applications. Herein, we present the successful doping of various lanthanide ions (Ce3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+ and Yb3+) into the lattices of CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs through a modified hot-injection method. For the lanthanide ions doped perovskite NCs, high photoluminescence quantum yield (QY), stable and widely tunable multi-color emissions spanning from visible to near-infrared (NIR) regions are successfully obtained. This work indicates that the doped perovskite NCs will inherit most of the unique optical properties of lanthanide ions and deliver them to the perovskite NC host, thus endowing the family of perovskite materials with excellent optical, electric and/or magnetic properties.",

        "abstract": "The environmental toxicity of Pb in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells remains an issue, which has triggered intense research on seeking alternative Pb-free perovskites for solar applications. Halide perovskites based on group-VA cations of Bi3+ and Sb3+ with the same lone-pair ns2 state as Pb2+ are promising candidates. Herein, through a joint experimental and theoretical study, we demonstrate that Cl-incorporated methylammonium Sb halide perovskites (CH3NH3)3Sb2ClXI9-X show promise as efficient solar absorbers for Pb-free perovskite solar cells. Inclusion of methylammonium chloride into the precursor solutions suppresses the formation of the undesired zero-dimensional dimer phase and leads to the successful synthesis of high-quality perovskite films composed of the two-dimensional layered phase favored for photovoltaics. Solar cells based on the as-obtained (CH3NH3)3Sb2ClXI9-X films reach a record-high power conversion efficiency over 2%. This finding offers a new perspective for the development of non-toxic and low-cost Sb-based perovskite solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Solar cells based on methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI) have shown remarkable progress in recent years and have demonstrated efficiencies greater than 20%. However, the long-term stability of MAPbI-based solar cells has yet to be achieved. Besides the well-known chemical and thermal instabilities, significant native ion migration in lead halide perovskites leads to current-voltage hysteresis and photoinduced phase segregation. Recently, it is further revealed that, despite having excellent chemical stability, the Au electrode can cause serious solar cell degradation due to Au diffusion into MAPbI. In addition to Au, many other metals have been used as electrodes in MAPbI solar cells. However, how the external metal impurities introduced by electrodes affect the long-term stability of MAPbI solar cells has rarely been studied. A comprehensive study of formation energetics and diffusion dynamics of a number of noble and transition metal impurities (Au, Ag, Cu, Cr, Mo, W, Co, Ni, Pd) in MAPbI based on first-principles calculations is reported herein. The results uncover important general trends of impurity formation and diffusion in MAPbI and provide useful guidance for identifying the optimal metal electrodes that do not introduce electrically active impurity defects in MAPbI while having low resistivities and suitable work functions for carrier extraction.",

Significant ion diffusion and ionic conductivity in CH3NH3PbI3 have been reported; their nature, however, remain controversial. In the literature, the use of different experimental techniques leads to the observation of different diffusing ions (either iodine or CH3NH3 ion); the calculated diffusion barriers for native defects scatter in a wide range; the calculated defect formation energies also differ qualitatively. These controversies hinder the understanding and the control of the ion migration in CH3NH3PbI3.

However, the development of Sn perovskite solar cells has been impeded by their extremely poor stability when exposed to oxygen. We report low-dimensional Sn perovskites that exhibit markedly enhanced air stability in comparison with their 3D counterparts. The reduced degradation under air exposure is attributed to the improved thermodynamic stability after dimensional reduction, the encapsulating organic ligands, and the compact perovskite film preventing oxygen ingress. We then explore these highly oriented low-dimensional Sn perovskite films in solar cells. The perpendicular growth of the perovskite domains between electrodes allows efficient charge carrier transport, leading to power conversion efficiencies of 5.94% without the requirement of further device structure engineering.

Finding new, stable, Pb-free perovskites currently attracts significant research interest. Among various strategies, hetero-substitution of Pb to form quaternary halide double perovskites represents a promising direction to keep the high structural (and likely electronic) dimensionality nature of perovskite lattice and meanwhile offers rich chemical compositions a degree of freedom for discovering new perovskite materials. We herein present a perspective that concisely reviews the progress of rational design of Pb-free halide double perovskites by both theoretical and experimental efforts as well as their current and potential applications in various optoelectronic categories. We also envision the future research directions to realize new materials by exploring broader chemical composition space and to better utilize existing materials by considering optoelectronic properties modulation.",

        "abstract": "Lead-free halide double perovskites with the formula of quaternary A$_2^+$Bu0027Bu0027$^{3+}$X$_6^-$ have recently attracted intense interest as alternatives to lead-halide-perovskite-based optoelectronic materials for their non-toxicity and enhanced chemical and thermodynamic stability. However, the understanding of intrinsic defect properties and their effects on carrier transport and Fermi level tuning is still limited. In this paper, we show that, by exploring the phase diagram of a halide double perovskite, one can control the effects of intrinsic defects on carrier trapping and Fermi level pinning. We reveal the ideal growth conditions to grow p-type Cs$_2$AgInCl$_6$ and Cs$_2$AgBiCl$_6$ as well as semi-insulating Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ with low trap density for targeted photovoltaic or visible-light/radiation detection application.",

Herein, we exploit the electronic structure underpinning of classic Cu[In,Ga]Se2 (CIGS) chalcopyrite solar absorbers to design Pb-free halide perovskites by transmuting 2Pb to the pair [BIB + CIII] such as [Cu + Ga] or [Ag + In] and combinations thereof.

        "abstract": "In this work, the pseudohalide thiocyanate has been demonstrated as a promising alternative to the halide anion to engineer optoelectronic properties of inorganic/organic hybrid perovskites because it exhibits better chemical stability than the halide anion. Previous reports have suggested that the ionic radii and electronegativity of SCN\u2212 is close to that of I\u2212; the SCN\u2212 doped CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited similar optical properties as pure CH3NH3PbI3. Consequently, it was expected that doping of CsPbBr3 perovskite with SCN\u2212 would result in band gap narrowing. Interestingly, the photoluminescent all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals exhibit an abnormal blue shift in optical properties and improvement of the crystallinity when successfully doped by SCN\u2212. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that doping of the CsPbBr3 perovskite with the rod-like SCN\u2212 anion introduced disorder in the crystal lattice, leading to its expansion, and impacted the electronic structure of the perovskite with band gap broadening.",

Herein, a structural regulation strategy is demonstrated to regulate the geometric symmetry of formamidiniumtin iodide (FASnI3) perovskite. Experimental and theoretical works show that the introduction of cesium cation (Cs+) could improve the geometric symmetry, suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, and enhance the thermodynamical structural stability of FASnI3. As a result, the inverted planer Cs-doped FASnI3-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) is shown to maintain 90% of its initial power-conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 h stored in N2, which is the best durability so far for 3D Sn-based PSCs. Most importantly, the air, thermal, and illumination stability of the PSCs are all improved after Cs doping. The PCE of the Cs-doped PSC shows a 63% increase compared to control device (from 3.74% to 6.08%) due to the improved quality of Cs-doped FASnI3 film.",

        "abstract": "Dielectric screening plays an important role in reducing the strength of carrier scattering and trapping by point defects for many semiconductors such as the halide perovskite solar materials. However, it was rarely considered as a screen to find new electronic semiconductors. We performed a material search study using the dielectric properties as a screen to identify potential electronic materials in the class of metal-pnictide ternary sulfosalts, containing Bi or Sb. These salts are basically ionic due to the electronegativity difference between both the S and both the metal and pnictogen elements. However, we do find significant cross-gap hybridization between the S p derived valence bands and pnictogen p derived conduction bands in many of the materials. This leads to enhanced Born effective charges, and in several cases, highly enhanced dielectric constants. We find a chemical rule for high dielectric constant in terms of the bond connectivity of the pnictogen-chalcogen part of the crystal structure. We additionally find a series of compounds with low effective mass, high dielectric constant and other properties that suggest good performance as electronic materials, and also several potential thermoelectric compounds. Experimental optical data and solar conversion efficiency are reported for Sn-Sb-S samples and results in accord with predicted good performance are found. The results illustrate the utility of dielectric properties as a screen for identifying complex semiconductors.",

This work reports the development of a robust and efficient method for assessing the similarity of structures on the basis of their interatomic distances. Using this method, we proposed a simple and unambiguous definition of crystal structure prototype based on hierarchical clustering theory, and constructed the crystal structure prototype database (CSPD) by filtering the known crystallographic structures in a database. With similar method, a program structure prototype analysis package (SPAP) was developed to remove similar structures in CALYPSO prediction results and extract predicted low energy structures for a separate theoretical structure database. A series of statistics describing the distribution of crystal structure prototypes in the CSPD was compiled to provide an important insight for structure prediction and high-throughput calculations. Illustrative examples of the application of the proposed database are given, including the generation of initial structures for structure prediction and determination of the prototype structure in databases. These examples demonstrate the CSPD to be a generally applicable and useful tool for materials discovery.",

        "abstract": "Atomic doping of clusters is known as an effective approach to stabilize or modify the structures and properties of resulting doped clusters. We herein report the effect of manganese (Mn) doping on the structure evolution of small-sized boron (B) clusters. The global minimum structures of both neutral and charged Mn doped B cluster [Formula: see text] (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u200910-20 and Q\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20090, \u00b11) have been proposed through extensive first-principles swarm-intelligence based structure searches. It is found that Mn doping has significantly modified the grow behaviors of B clusters, leading to two novel structural transitions from planar to tubular and then to cage-like B structures in both neutral and charged species. Half-sandwich-type structures are most favorable for small [Formula: see text] (n\u2009\u2009\u2a7d\u2009\u200913) clusters and gradually transform to Mn-centered double-ring tubular structures at [Formula: see text] clusters with superior thermodynamic stabilities compared with their neighbors. Most strikingly, endohedral cages become the ground-state structures for larger [Formula: see text] (n\u2009\u2009\u2a7e\u2009\u200919) clusters, among which [Formula: see text] adopts a highly symmetric structure with superior thermodynamic stability and a large HOMO-LUMO gap of 4.53\u2009eV. The unique stability of the endohedral [Formula: see text] cage is attributed to the geometric fit and formation of 18-electron closed-shell configuration. The results significantly advance our understanding about the structure and bonding of B-based clusters and strongly suggest transition-metal doping as a viable route to synthesize intriguing B-based nanomaterials.",

        "abstract": "Titanium dioxide has been widely used as an efficient transition metal oxide photocatalyst. However, its photocatalytic activity is limited to the ultraviolet spectrum range due to the large bandgap beyond 3 eV. Efforts to reduce the bandgap to achieve a broader spectrum range of light absorption have been successfully attempted via the experimental synthesis of dopant-free metastable surface structures of rutile-type TiO (011) 2 \u00d7 1. This new surface phase possesses a reduced bandgap of \u223c2.1 eV, showing great potential for an excellent photocatalyst covering a wide range of visible light. There is a need to establish the atomistic structure of this metastable surface to understand the physical cause for the bandgap reduction and to improve the future design of photocatalysts. Here, we report computational investigations in an effort to unravel this surface structure via swarm structure-searching simulations. The established structure adopts the anatase (101)-like structure model, where the topmost 2-fold O atoms form a quasi-hexagonal surface pattern and bond with the unsaturated 5-fold and 4-fold Ti atoms in the next layer. The predicted anatase (101)-like surface model can naturally explain the experimental observation of the STM images, the electronic bandgap, and the oxidation state of Ti. Dangling bonds on the anatase (101)-like surface are abundant making it a superior photocatalyst. First-principles molecular dynamics simulations have supported the high photocatalytic activity by showing that water and formic acid molecules dissociate spontaneously on the anatase (101)-like surface.",

        "abstract": "Electrides are ionic solids that consist of cationic frameworks and anionic electrons trapped in the voids of lattices. Organic electrides exist in a large abundance, but the thermal instability at room temperature and sensitivity to moisture are bottlenecks that limit their practical uses. Known inorganic electrides are rare but appear to have high thermal and chemical stability and exhibit promising applications as electron-emitting materials, superior catalysts and strong reducing agents. Here, we report a developed inverse-design method that can be used to search for a large variety of inorganic electrides. Our method utilizes the intrinsic property of interstitial electron localization of electrides as the global variable function being incorporated into the swarm-intelligence based structure searches. Through screening 99 binary ionic compounds, we have designed 89 new inorganic electrides that are classified into three-, two-, and zero-dimensional species according to the way that the interstitial electrons are localized and the conductive properties of the systems. Our work reveals the rich abundance of inorganic electrides by extending them into more general forms and provides new structure types for electrides that are not thought of as before.",

        "abstract": "Electrides are intrinsic electron-rich materials enabling applications as excellent electron emitters, superior catalysts, and strong reducing agents. There are a number of organic electrides; however, their instability at room temperature and sensitivity to moisture are bottlenecks for their practical uses. Known inorganic electrides are rare, but they appear to have greater thermal stability at ambient conditions and are thus better characterized for application. Here, we develop a computer-assisted inverse-design method for searching for a large variety of inorganic electrides unbiased by any known electride structures. It uses the intrinsic property of interstitial electron localization of electrides as the global variable function for swarm intelligence structure searches. We construct two rules of thumb on the design of inorganic electrides pointing to electron-rich ionic systems and low electronegativity of the cationic elements involved. By screening 99 such binary compounds through large-scale computer simulations, we identify 24 stable and 65 metastable new inorganic electrides that show distinct three-, two-, and zero-dimensional conductive properties, among which 18 are existing compounds that have not been pointed to as electrides. Our work reveals the rich abundance of inorganic electrides by providing 33 hitherto unexpected structure prototypes of electrides, of which 19 are not in the known structure databases.

        "abstract": "Paeoniflorin (Pae) is a monoterpene glucoside and the main component of the total glucosides of paeony (TGP) extracted from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora. Its anti-inflammatory effect is associated with regulating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling. The aim of this study was to explore the expression change of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and the effect of Pae. Pae was obtained and purified from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora. We investigated the expression of GRK2 in synovium during the inflammatory process and assessed the effects of a specific GRK2 inhibitor and Pae on proliferation, cAMP level, and protein kinase A (PKA) activity of FLS in vitro. Additionally, the effect of Pae on GRK2 expression in FLS was detected in vitro. Expression of GRK2 in synovium from CIA rats increased during the inflammatory process. The specific GRK2 inhibitor suppressed proliferation and increased the cAMP level as well as PKA activity of FLS, and Pae had the same effects. Furthermore, Pae decreased GRK2 expression in FLS in vitro. Our results indicate that a chronic inflammatory process in CIA induces upregulation of GRK2 expression in FLS, and Pae can reverse this change, which might be one of the important mechanisms for Pae regulating GPCRs signaling and suppressing the proliferation of FLS in CIA.",

        "abstract": "Therapeutic vaccines that arouse the cytotoxic T cell immune response to reject infected cells have been investigated extensively for treating disease. Due to the large amounts of resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells in lymph nodes, great efforts have been made to explore the strategy of targeting lymph nodes directly with nanovaccines to activate T cells. However, these nanovaccines still have several problems, such as a low loading efficiency and compromised activity of antigens and adjuvants derived from traditional complicated preparation. There are also safety concerns about materials synthesized without FDA approval. Herein, we construct an assembled nanoparticle composed of an antigen (ovalbumin, OVA) and adjuvant (CpG) to ensure its safety and high loading efficiency. The activity of both components was well preserved due to the mild self-assembly process. The small size, narrow distribution, negative charge, and good stability of the nanoparticle endow these nanovaccines with superior capacity for lymph node targeting. Correspondingly, the accumulation at lymph nodes can be improved by 10-fold. Subsequently, due to the sufficient APC internalization and maturation in lymph nodes, ~60% of T cells are stimulated to proliferate and over 70% of target cells are specifically killed. Based on the effective and quick cellular immune response, the assembled nanoparticles exhibit great potential as therapeutic vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Many candidate anticancer drugs have suffered from their intrinsic hydrophobicity, which poses several obstacles for clinical application. To overcome this challenge and further improve the performance, herein a nanocrystal-based biomimetic formulation with a sandwich structure is developed. As the core, flake shaped nanocrystals (NCs) with high loading of the hydrophobic drug hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) are synthesized via a mild nanoprecipitation process by exploring the template effect of serum albumin. Meanwhile, the camouflaged cancer cell membrane (CM) composed of plentiful membrane proteins endows the NCs with homotypic targeting capacity at tumor sites. In addition, the photosensitizer indocyanine green sandwiched between NCs and CM not only converts near infrared light to heat for photothermal treatment but also improves the dissolution of HCPT NCs for chemotherapy. These features corporately achieve the orchestration of chemo-photothermal combination therapy and completely inhibit tumor growth with few adverse effects, showing promise as a new modality for the utilization of hydrophobic drugs to treat cancer.",

        "abstract": "As traditional anticancer treatments fail to significantly improve the prognoses, exploration of therapeutic modalities is urgently needed. Herein, a biomimetic magnetosome is constructed to favor the ferroptosis/immunomodulation synergism in cancer. This magnetosome composes of Fe3O4 magnetic nanocluster (NC) as the core, and pre-engineered leukocyte membranes as the cloak, wherein TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (Ti) can be loaded inside the membrane and PD-1 antibody (Pa) can be anchored on the membrane surface. After intravenous injection, the membrane camouflage results in long circulation, and the NC core with magnetization and superparamagnetism enables magnetic targeting with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Once inside tumor, Pa and Ti cooperate to create an immunogenic microenvironment, which elevates H2O2 amount in polarized M1 macrophage and thus promotes the Fenton reaction with Fe ions released from NCs. The generated hydroxyl radicals (\u00b7OH) subsequently induce lethal ferroptosis to tumor cells, and the exposed tumor antigen in turn improves the microenvironment immunogenicity. The synergism of immunomodulation and ferroptosis in such a cyclical manner therefore leads to potent therapeutic effects with few abnormalities, which supports the engineered magnetosomes as a promising combination modality for anticancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Although the antimonene (AM) nanomaterial is recently emerging as a new photothermal therapy (PTT) agent, its rapid degradation in physiological medium immensely limits its direct utilization. To this end, we herein engineered AM by the cooperation of dimension optimization, size control, and cell membrane (CM) camouflage. Compared with traditional AM nanosheets, the resulting AM nanoparticles (\u223c55 nm) cloaked with the CM (denoted as CmNPs) exhibited significantly improved stability and increased photothermal efficacy as well as superior tumor targeting capacity. After intravenous injection, the CmNPs enabled satisfactory photoacoustic/photothermal multimodal imaging at tumor sites. Meanwhile, the PTT together with the newly explored function of photodynamic therapy (PDT) achieved a potent combination therapy with few side effects. The maximized theranostic performance thus strongly recommends CmNPs as a safe and highly reliable modality for anticancer therapy.",

In this study, in vitro hepatotoxicity of different extracts from E. adenophorum were determined on human hepatocyte cell line L02 and hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. The results showed that water extracts of E. adenophorum exhibited no hepatotoxicity in vitro while high concentrations of the organic solvent extracts had obvious hepatotoxicity. Sesquiterpenes may contribute to the toxicity based on the comparison of composition analysis. Three cadinene sesquiterpenes were purified and identified as 9-oxo-10,11-dehydroageraphorone, 10H\u03b1-9-oxo-ageraphorone and 10H\u03b2-9-oxo-ageraphorone. In vitro hepatotoxic effects of these components were investigated, the IC of the three compounds were 122.53, 87.52, and 108.80\u00a0\u03bcM in L02 cells and 151.92, 104.48, and 138.08\u00a0\u03bcM in HepG2 cells by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.

Three chlorogenic acid products were prepared with different purities of 6.11%, 22.17%, and 96.03%. Phytochemical analysis demonstrated that the main toxins of sesquiterpenes were almost completely removed in sample preparation procedure. The three products were evaluated for safety via in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies. All the products exhibited no cytotoxic effects at a dose of 400 \u03bcg/mL in an in vitro cell viability assay. When administered in vivo at a single dose up to 1.5 g/kg bw, all three products caused no signs or symptoms of toxicity in mice.

The entire procedure consisted of two separation steps. The first step was enrichment of chlorogenic acid from the crude extract by NKA-II macroporous resin. The purity of chlorogenic acid increased from 5.3% to 20.9% with a recovery of 88.7%. Subsequently, polyamide resin was used to achieve a higher purity. After the polyamide resin treatment, the main toxin 9-oxo-10,11-dehydroageraphorone was removed and the purity of chlorogenic acid reached 86.5% with a recovery of 84.8%. It provided a new way for the utilization of E. adenophorum.",

To shrink the filter layout, a pair of loaded quarter-wavelength stubs is utilised to produce the first passband.

Both bandwidth and central frequency ratio of the two passbands can be adjusted freely by the circuit parameters. Two coupling lines are added beside the resonator as feed-lines to construct a filter with high selectivity and compact size.

The polyphase networks (PPNs ) are used to convert the single-ended local-oscillator input signal to quadrature signals. A pair of inductors is added to traditional PPN to enhance the return loss performance, while optimizing the image-reject ratio. A common-emitter tranconductance using the feedforward technique is applied to a quadrature active Gilbert mixer to obtain relative high linearity, and the optical solution for high-frequency applications is given and analyzed. An active differential to single totem-pole balun is applied as the output stage, which is well matched to load impedance and can provide medium output power. Measured results show excellent performance in the designed frequency from 400 MHz to 6 GHz.",

Considering the low breakdown voltage and the correlation between characteristic frequency and bias current density of the silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistor, the bias circuit is designed to improve the breakdown voltage of the power amplifier and meet the W band characteristic frequency at the same time. The simulation results show that the designed bias circuit can make the amplifier operate normally from \u221240 to 125 \u00b0C.

Considering the complex non-linear relationship between power demand and its influencing factors, it is difficult to describe it accurately with the traditional mathematical models. In this paper, we select six major influencing factors and use the support vector machine to predict future power demand. The prediction accuracy is improved by parameter optimizing.

Unlike the existing unequal error protection and layer-aware FEC which decode each layer symbols with a probability, the new approach is capable of decoding each layer data deterministically as long as enough symbols are received corresponding to the specific layer. The lower layer is always decoded prior to upper layers, which facilitates the delivery of scalable media stream, especially in mobile TV services with heterogeneous networks and terminals. In order to evaluate the performance fairly, this paper compares the minimum channel capacity required by several FEC schemes. The experimental results show that the new approach outperforms the existing schemes in severely degraded channel situations.",

        "abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration approved niraparib, a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, on March 27, 2017, for maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Approval was based on data from the NOVA trial comparing niraparib with placebo in two independent cohorts, based on germline BRCA mutation status (gBRCAm vs. non-gBRCAm). Progression-free survival (PFS) in each cohort was the primary endpoint. In the gBRCAm cohort, estimated median PFS on niraparib was 21 months vs. 5.5 months on placebo (HR 0.26; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.41; p-value <0.0001). In the non-gBRCAm cohort, estimated median PFS for niraparib and placebo was 9.3 months and 3.9 months, respectively (HR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.61; p<0.0001). Common adverse reactions (>20% and higher incidence in niraparib arm) with niraparib include thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, nausea, constipation, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, dyspnea, rash, and hypertension. There were 5 cases of MDS/AML (1.4%) in patients treated with niraparib compared with 2 cases (1.1%) on placebo. Niraparib is the first PARP inhibitor approved as maintenance therapy for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients, with improvement in PFS, for patients regardless of gBRCAm status.",

Approval was based on demonstration of clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival (OS) and an acceptable safety profile in two randomized clinical trials (OAK and POPLAR). Median OS in OAK, a phase III trial, was 13.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 11.8-15.7] in the atezolizumab arm compared with 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.6-11.2) in the docetaxel arm [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.87;  = 0.0004]. Median OS in POPLAR, a phase II trial, was 12.6 months (95% CI, 9.7-16.0) and 9.7 months (95% CI, 8.6-12.0; HR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92) for the atezolizumab and docetaxel arms, respectively. In patients treated with atezolizumab, the most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions were fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea, cough, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, and constipation; the most common (\u22652%) grade 3 to 4 adverse events were dyspnea, pneumonia, hypoxia, hyponatremia, fatigue, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, aspartate aminotransferase increase, alanine aminotransferase increase, dysphagia, and arthralgia. Clinically significant immune-related adverse events for patients receiving atezolizumab included 1.4% incidence each of grade 3 to 4 pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, and thyroid disease. .",

Approval was based on data from the APHINITY trial, which randomized patients to receive pertuzumab or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. After 45.4 months median follow-up, the proportion of invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) events in the intent-to-treat population was 7.1% (n=171) in the pertuzumab arm and 8.7% (n=210) for placebo (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.00; p=0.047). The proportion of IDFS events in patients with HR-negative disease was 8.2% (n=71) and 10.6% (n=91) in the pertuzumab and placebo arms, respectively (HR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.04). The proportion of IDFS events for patients with node positive disease was 9.2% (n=139) and 12.1% (n=181) in the pertuzumab and placebo arms, respectively (HR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.96). Adverse reactions in \u2265 30% of patients receiving pertuzumab were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting.

Contemporary immunotherapy protocols generally allow patients to continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed radiographic PD as long as there is ongoing clinical benefit. However, the frequency of responses beyond PD is unknown, and whether this strategy is beneficial to the patient remains unclear. We present a review of the data from patients with mRCC treated beyond PD with nivolumab on CheckMate 025 (a randomized, phase 3 study of nivolumab vs. everolimus in locally advanced or mRCC). Methods: Subjects on CheckMate 025 who received any treatment beyond radiographic PD were identified. Dates of progression, treatment discontinuation, and corresponding tumor measurements were analyzed. Results: Treatment beyond radiographic PD occurred in 171 of patients treated with nivolumab. Median treatment duration beyond radiographic progression was 3.2 mo...",

We sought to determine the association between the maximum reduction in tumor target lesions from baseline (DepOR) with overall survival (OS) for two drugs, an ALK inhibitor (ALKi) and a PD-1 inhibitor (PD-1i), which represent the targeted and immune therapy drug classes. Methods: Data from two randomized trials were pooled for each drug for exploratory analyses. Data from patients with any tumor shrinkage were grouped into 4 quartiles based on the greatest percent shrinkage in tumor target lesions from baseline and compared to data from patients with no tumor shrinkage.

        "abstract": "Importance  Novel intermediate end points may be useful to detect signals of early activity and prioritize new therapies to treat patients with advanced malignant neoplasms, including metastatic non\u2013small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC).  Objective  To explore milestone rate, a proposed intermediate end point for immunotherapy trials.  Data Sources  Trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration with more than 150 patients and in which the intention-to-treat population was assessed were identified.  Study Selection  An initial meta-analysis identified 14 randomized clinical trials for treatment of mNSCLC with active controls submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2013. An additional 11 randomized clinical trials submitted from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2016 were included.  Data Extraction and Synthesis  Two investigators abstracted data and pooled data to compare trial-level milestone ratios with conventional end points.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Trial-level milestone ratios for milestone rates were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) within 6 months, 9-month progression-free survival (PFS), 9-month overall survival (OS), and 12-month OS. A weighted linear regression model evaluated associations between milestone ratios and hazard ratios (HRs). Experimental and control arms of trials testing immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and other trials were pooled to compare Kaplan-Meier survival estimates in the 3 therapeutic classes.  Results  A total of 20\u202f013 unique patients (65.4% male and 34.6% female; mean age, 60 [range, 18-92] years) with advanced lung cancer were identified in 25 unique trials. A moderate association was observed between 12-month OS milestone ratio and OS HR ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.80; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91) and 9-month OS milestone ratio and OS HR ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82). No associations were observed between 9-month PFS milestone ratio and OS HR ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.49) or 6-month ORR and OS HR ( R  2 \u2009=\u20090.05; 95% CI, 0.0001-0.31). The aggregated Kaplan-Meier analysis of immunotherapy trials vs chemotherapy revealed an OS HR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.75) and PFS HR of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.89). Targeted therapy trials vs chemotherapy had an OS HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80-1.19) and PFS HR of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.42-0.56).  Conclusions and Relevance  This analysis of milestone rates suggests a moderate association between OS milestones at 12 or 9 months and OS HR but not 9-month PFS or 6-month ORR milestones and OS HR. Although OS at 12 months had the strongest association with OS HR, it may not be the optimal time for future trials, which will increasingly have immunotherapy as the control, deploy new biomarker-enrichment strategies, and likely enroll patients with longer survival. Milestone rates may be useful as a complementary tool to summarize or interpret trial results or as a secondary end point in exploratory studies.",

In this paper, a phase-field model with finite interface dissipation was employed to construct kinetic phase diagrams in the ternary Al-Cu-Li system for the first time. The time-elimination relaxation scheme was utilized. The solute trapping phenomenon during rapid solidification could be nicely described by the phase-field simulation, and the results obtained from the experiment measurement and/or the theoretical model were also well reproduced. Based on the predicted kinetic phase diagrams, it was found that with the increase of interface moving velocity and/or temperature, the gap between the liquidus and solidus gradually reduces, which illustrates the effect of solute trapping and tendency of diffusionless solidification.",

The work entailed initial preparation of three fcc Cu-Sn diffusion couples, which were used to determine the composition-dependent interdiffusivities at 873 K, 923 K, and 973 K, to validate the literature data and provide new experimental data at low temperatures. Then, atomic mobilities in three boundary binaries, fcc Cu-Sn, fcc Ag-Sn, and fcc Cu-Ag, were updated based on the data for various experimental diffusivities obtained from the literature and the present work, together with the available thermodynamic database for solder alloys. Finally, based on the large number of interdiffusivities recently measured from the present authors, atomic mobilities in the fcc Cu-Ag-Sn ternary system were carefully evaluated. A comprehensive comparison between various calculated/model-predicted diffusion properties and the experimental data was used to validate the reliability of the obtained atomic mobilities in ternary fcc Cu-Ag-Sn alloys.",

        "abstract": "The effect of different initial structures on the simulation of microstructure evolution during normal grain growth was comparatively studied by using a two-dimensional phase-field model. Three methods, standard Voronoi construction, weighted Voronoi construction, and hand drawing, were used to generate the initial structures. For the hand-drawn initial structure, different boundary conditions, including periodic and gradient boundary conditions, were also applied. The phase-field simulation of normal grain growth in the succinonitrile\u2013coumarin152 system was chosen as the benchmark, and compared with the experimental microstructure evolution. The phase-field simulated results generally conformed to Hillert\u2019s theory, Von Neumann\u2013Mullins law, and the experimental results. Different initial structures with similar initial grain size distribution showed similar grain size evolution. The simulation results for the \u201cexperimental\u201d initial structure constructed by hand drawing showed best agreement with the experimental results during the early stage of grain growth process. With the increased time, the accuracy of simulation appeared strongly dependent on the grain numbers, and thus the gradient boundary condition is more suitable for long-time grain growth simulation than the periodic boundary condition. Overall, the combination of phase-field simulation and \u201cexperimental\u201d initial microstructures allows the study of the grain growth in arbitrary polycrystalline materials, as demonstrated here for comprehensive study of austenite grain growth in two commercial high-strength steels.",

Based on all kinds of diffusivities from the literature and the present work together with the reliable thermodynamic description of the liquid phase available in the literature, the atomic mobilities in the Ag\u2013Al\u2013Cu melts were evaluated using the DIffusion-Controlled TRAnsformations (DICTRA) software package. Comprehensive comparisons between the calculated results and the experimentally measured data show that most of the diffusivities from different sources can be well reproduced by the atomic mobilities obtained in the present work. The atomic mobilities were further verified by comparing the model-predicted concentration profiles and the measured ones in two liquid Ag\u2013Al\u2013Cu diffusion couples. Furthermore, on the basis of the established thermodynamic and atomic mobility databases, the univariant and invariant eutectic solidification in ternary Ag\u2013Al\u2013Cu alloys were also successfully simulated using DICTRA with the aid of a newly designed geometry.",

Formation of La 2 O 3 , Co 3 O 4  and CoO phases across the membrane is predicted. The kinetic demixing process can be divided into two stages, namely, establishment of the oxygen potential gradient (fast) and demixing of the cations (slow); the former is controlled by the mobility of oxygen ions, and the latter is determined by the higher mobility of Co ions as compared to the La ion in the ABO 3 -type perovskite. A drift motion of both oxide surfaces towards the high  P O 2  side occurs with the movement of cations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on 9 groups of ternary Ni-Al-Ta diffusion couples, high-throughput measurement of the composition-dependent interdiffusivity matrices in Ni-rich fcc Ni-Al-Ta alloys at 1473, 1523 and 1573 K was performed in the present work by using the recently developed pragmatic numerical inverse method. The errors for the determined interdiffusivities were evaluated by a scientific method considering the error propagation. Since one set of adjustable parameters was utilized for all the diffusion couples at one temperature, the main interdiffusivity planes over the investigated composition range at three temperatures were then constructed. The reliability of the determined interdiffusivities was first validated by reproducing the experimental composition profiles and interdiffusion fluxes for each diffusion couple, then by directly comparing with the limit interdiffusivities calculated by the traditional Matano\u2013Kirkaldy method, and finally by extrapolating ternary interdiffusivities into boundary Ni-Al and Ni-Ta binaries and comparing with the binary experimental data. The simulated/calculated diffusion properties can reproduce most of the experimental data, indicating that the interdiffusivities obtained via the pragmatic numerical inverse method are reliable. On the basis of the constructed main interdiffusivity planes at different temperatures, the composition-dependent activation energies for the main interdiffusivities were evaluated, from which the activation energy planes over the investigated composition range were then constructed.",

By means of the electron probe microanalyzer technique and recently developed numerical inverse method, the composition-dependent interdiffusivities at different temperatures were effectively evaluated by minimizing the residual between the model-predicted compositions/interdiffusion fluxes and the respectively experimental ones. After that, the tracer diffusivities were predicted based on the assessed mobility parameters and thermodynamic descriptions with the simplified ideal solution model. The comprehensive comparison between the interdiffusivities/tracer diffusivities in the Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni high-entropy alloys and those in sub-binary, ternary, quaternary and other quinary alloys indicates that the sluggish diffusion exists in interdiffusion instead of tracer diffusion for the present Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni high-entropy alloys.",

In this paper, the composition-dependent interdiffusivity matrices of face centered cubic (fcc) Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Ti HESAs at 1473\u202fK were first determined  via  a combination of diffusion multiple technique and HitDIC software based on the numerical inverse method. The correlations between the main interdiffusivities and the components suggest that alloying elements play great impact on diffusion in HESAs. After that, comprehensive comparisons of the interdiffusivities and tracer diffusivities in present fcc HESAs with the literature data in fcc-based pure elements, lower-order alloys and traditional high-entropy alloys were conducted. The results indicate that the sluggish diffusion effect exists for only some of the components in the present HESAs. Moreover, comparisons of the diffusion coefficients between the HESAs and traditional Ni-based superalloys with refractory elements show that the interdiffusivities in the present HESAs are lower than the Ni-based superalloys with most refractory elements, but higher than those with Ir, Re and Os. Furthermore, it is also found that refractory elements need to be added in order to further improve the creep resistance of the HESAs.",

Based on limited experimental phase stability data together with the first-principles computed free energies, a thermodynamic evaluation of the pseudo-ternary c-TiN/c-AlN/c-CrN system was first performed using the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) technique, allowing the construction of the metastable phase equilibria. This thermodynamic description was used in combination with the Cahn-Hilliard model to perform numerical simulation of the microstructure evolution in c-Ti 0.45 Al 0.47 Cr 0.08 N coating during spinodal decomposition. The simulated results showed that Cr atoms were distributed in both c-TiN- and c-AlN-rich domains with preferential location at the interface regions. This enrichment at the interface can decrease the lattice mismatch and lead to a smaller driving force for spinodal decomposition compared with Cr-free coatings. Overall, the simulated composition wavelengths after 7200\u00a0s agree well with the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Based on the recently developed numerical inverse method, high-throughput measurement of the composition-dependent interdiffusivity matrices in the bcc_A2 Fe-Mn-Si alloys at 1173, 1273 and 1373\u00a0K was performed in the present work. To verify the reliability of the presently determined interdiffusivities, the ternary interdiffusivities evaluated by the traditional Matano-Kirkaldy method at the intersection points of the diffusion paths were employed to make a direct comparison. Subsequently, on the basis of the presently obtained interdiffusivities together with the thermodynamic descriptions for bcc_A2 phase in the Fe-Mn-Si system, atomic mobilities of Fe, Mn and Si in bcc_A2 Fe-Mn-Si alloys were assessed by means of DICTRA (DIffusion Controlled TRAnsformatim) software package. The comprehensive comparison between various calculated/model-predicted diffusion properties, including interdiffusivities, concentration profiles, interdiffusion fluxes and diffusion paths, and the experimental data indicates that most of the experimental data can be well produced by the presently obtained atomic mobilities. Moreover, the reliability of the present atomic mobilities was further validated by reproducing the experimental composition profiles which were not utilized in the assessment procedure.",

By coupling with the CALPHAD thermodynamic database, two- and three-dimensional quantitative numerical simulations of microstructure evolution in metastable c\u2013Ti 1\u2212x Al x N coatings during spinodal decomposition were performed using Cahn-Hilliard model. Three sets of diffusivity data available in the literature were carefully screened by comparing the simulated microstructures with the experimental ones, and one of them was chosen for the final simulations. The simulated composition wavelengths during spinodal decomposition at different temperatures agree with the experimental data. Moreover, the effect of the composition fluctuation on the microstructure evolution during spinodal decomposition was also comprehensively investigated.",

By analyzing the composition profiles using the Whittle-Green method, the interdiffusion coefficients were deduced at the intersections of every two diffusion paths. These data were then combined with the thermodynamic description to determine the diffusion mobilities of Ni, Mo and W by means of DICTRA software. The calculated composition profiles and diffusion paths were carefully compared with the experimentally measured data, and an excellent agreement has been achieved. A previous conclusion that Mo diffuses faster than W in the Ni-base alloys was confirmed in the present work. In addition, Co promotes the diffusion of Mo whereas both Cr and W retard its diffusion in the Ni-base alloys containing 5.0\u202fat% Mo. Both Co and Mo retard the diffusion of W in the Ni-base alloys containing 5.0\u202fat%W.",

For the Al-Sn sub-binary system, the solubility of Sn in (Al) fcc , which was ignored in the previous assessment, together with the recently experimental enthalpies of mixing in the liquid phase were taken into account. The calculated phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties in the binary Al-Sn system showed better agreement with more experimental information than those in the previous assessment. As for the Mg-Al-Sn ternary system, the newly updated thermodynamic descriptions of the Al-Sn system as well as those of the Mg-Al and Mg-Sn binary systems from the literature were adopted. A set of reliable and self-consistent thermodynamic parameters for the Mg-Al-Sn ternary system were obtained by reassessing the thermodynaic parameters of the liquid and solid solutions. Better agreement between the calculated results and the experimental data was achieved in the present assessent in comparison with the previous one. Furthermore, the Scheil-Gulliver solidification simulations were performed to predict the volume fractions of Mg 2 Sn, (Mg) hcp  and \u03b3 (Mg 17 Al 12 ) phases in the 9 as-cast Mg-Al-Sn alloys. The simulation results were compared with the experiental as-cast microstructures in the literature, which further validated the presently obtained thermodynamic descriptions.",

With the aid of theoretical solidified microstructure analysis and its qualitative relationship with mechanical properties, the optimal amount of added Sc in A356 alloys was determined to be 0.54\u00a0wt.%. The experimental mechanical property measurements and microstructural characterizations confirmed that the A356-0.54\u00a0wt.% Sc alloy exhibits the best comprehensive mechanical performance. Additionally, the grain refining mechanisms in Sc-supplemented A356 alloys were described, suggesting a path for further improvement of the overall mechanical performance.",

Based on the critically-reviewed and presently evaluated diffusivity information, atomic mobility descriptions for liquid and fcc phases in the Al\u2013Si\u2013Mg\u2013RE systems are established by means of the Diffusion-Controlled TRAnsformation (DICTRA) software package. Comprehensive comparisons show that most of the measured and theoretically-predicted diffusivities can be reasonably reproduced by the present atomic mobility descriptions. The atomic mobility descriptions for liquid and fcc Al\u2013Si\u2013Mg\u2013RE alloys are further validated by comparing the model-predicted diffe...",

        "abstract": "Accurate determination of the nucleus composition during isothermal alloy solidification still represents a great challenge nowadays. In this paper, a kinetic scheme was added to the Hillert-Rettenmayr thermodynamic analysis of the deviation from local equilibrium at migrating phase interfaces. A so-called interface permeability was introduced to account for the unambiguous determination of the energy dissipation of the solute rearrangement at the liquid-solid interface and the driving force for interface movement, from which the nucleus composition can be then evaluated. After benchmark test, a pragmatic nucleation model for solidification was also proposed, and applied in three-dimensional phase-field simulations of nucleation and subsequent dendritic growth during isothermal solidification process in one hypothetic Al-Si alloy. Moreover, the influence of the interface permeability on nucleation rate was fully discussed by exploring its effect on the initial nucleus components and the corresponding nucleation driving force.",

The temperature- and concentration-dependent ternary interdiffusivities in Ni 3 Al-X (X\u202f=\u202fRh, Ta, W, Re, Os, and Ir) were determined from the experimental concentration profiles, and also fully validated.

It is finally suggested that addition of W and Ta in \u03b3\u2032 phase can retard the coarsening of \u03b3\u2032 phase and stabilize the microstructure of the nickel-based single crystal superalloys in terms of the diffusion coefficient.",

        "abstract": "A popular area of research in the field of high-temperature alloys concerns the search of substitutional elements for Re in order to manufacture single-crystal Ni-based superalloys with less or even no Re addition. To find the elements with similar or even lower diffusion coefficients than Re is an effective strategy. Based on 29 fcc diffusion couples in ternary Ni-Al-X (X = Re, Os, and Ir) systems, high-throughput measurement of composition- and temperature-dependent interdiffusivity matrices was performed using our recently developed numerical inverse method implemented in HitDIC software. The reliability of the determined interdiffusivities was validated by comprehensively comparing the model-predicted composition/interdiffusion flux profiles for each diffusion couple with the corresponding experimental data. Moreover, we also conducted a comparison with the interdiffusivities evaluated using the traditional Matano\u2013Kirkaldy method as well as those from the literature and in boundary binary systems. After that, a comprehensive comparison of the interdiffusion coefficients in fcc Ni-2 wt\u00a0pct Al-6 wt\u00a0pct X (X = Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) alloys at 1423 K to 1573 K was conducted. Results indicate that the diffusion rate of Re is lower than that of Os at 1473 K and 1523 K; but higher at 1573 K, while the diffusion rate of Ir is always slightly higher than those of Os and Re at 1473 K to 1573 K. Further analysis of the magnitude of the interdiffusion coefficient correlates with the alloying concentration, activation energy, atomic number, and atomic radius of different diffusing transition metal species (i.e., Ti, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt) was conducted, which is expected to provide useful information regarding element choice in the development of new-generation Ni-based single-crystal superalloys.",

Apart from the thermodynamic assessments, the interdiffusion coefficients for the fcc phase of the binary Ni-Ti were re-optimized and the ternary Ni-Cr-Ti system were determined experimentally over a temperature range from 1123 to 1273\u00a0K employing the diffusion-couple technique.

In this paper, we chose body-centered cubic (bcc) W as the target and presented a thermodynamic model to account for its Gibbs energy of pure bcc W from 0 K to melting point by including the contribution of thermal vacancy. A new formula for interaction part was proposed for describing the quadratic temperature behavior of vacancy formation energy. Based on the experimental/first-principles computed thermodynamic properties, all the parameters in the Gibbs energy function were assessed by following the proposed two-step optimization strategy. The thermodynamic behaviors, i.e., the strong nonlinear increase for temperature dependence of heat capacities at high temperatures and a nonlinear Arrhenius plot of vacancy concentration, in bcc W can be well reproduced by the obtained Gibbs energy. The successful description of thermal vacancy on such strongly non-linear thermodynamic behaviors in bcc W indicates that the presently proposed thermodynamic model and optimization strategy should be universal ones and are applicable to all other metals.",

        "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a well-orchestrated programmed process involved in age-related pathologies, tumor suppression and embryonic development. TGF-\u03b2/Smad is one of the predominant pathways that regulate damage-induced and developmentally programmed senescence. Here we show that canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling promotes senescence via miR-29-induced loss of H4K20me3. Mechanistically, oxidative stress triggers TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling gives rise to acute accumulation of miR-29a and miR-29c, both of which directly suppress their novel target, Suv4-20h, thus reducing H4K20me3 abundance in a Smad-dependent manner, which compromises DNA damage repair and genome maintenance. Loss of H4K20me3 mediated by the senescent TGF-\u03b2/miR-29 pathway contributes to cardiac aging in vivo. Disruption of TGF-\u03b2 signaling restores H4K20me3 and improves cardiac function in aged mice. Our study highlights the sequential mechanisms underlying the regulation of senescence, from senescence-inducing triggers to activation of responsive signaling followed by specific epigenetic alterations, shedding light on potential therapeutic interventions in cardiac aging.",

        "abstract": "Stimulatory regulators for DNA methyltransferase activity, such as Dnmt3L and some Dnmt3b isoforms, affect DNA methylation patterns, thereby maintaining gene body methylation and maternal methylation imprinting, as well as the methylation landscape of pluripotent cells. Here we show that metastasis-related methyltransferase 1 (Merm1), a protein deleted in individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome, acts as a repressive regulator of Dnmt3a. Merm1 interacts with Dnmt3a and represses its methyltransferase activity with the requirement of the binding motif for S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Functional analysis of gene regulation revealed that Merm1 is capable of maintaining hypomethylated rRNA gene bodies and co-localizes with RNA polymerase I in the nucleolus. Dnmt3a recruits Merm1, and in return, Merm1 ensures the binding of Dnmt3a to hypomethylated gene bodies. Such interplay between Dnmt3a and Merm1 facilitates transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase I. Our findings reveal a repressive factor for Dnmt3a and uncover a molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional elongation of rRNA genes.",

In this paper, we explain how the coupling effect interferes with the action of the sense amplifier (SA); then we introduce a coupling suppressed SA. In our design, we adjust the time control. The coupled signals are classified and suppressed by different turn on currents. The new architecture can achieve obvious improvement under differential input in our Monte Carlo simulation. The area and speed cost can be omitted. Through our work, we recommend our design of SA and draw attention to the coupling effect for other circuits.",

In this paper, a high-speed BIST design for embedded static random access memory (SRAM) and one-port register file (RF) IPs testing was presented. With the purpose of achieving high-speed requirement, the pipe-line strategy is adopted in BIST circuit. Four SRAM instances and four one-port RF instances with the BIST circuit are integrated in a test chip. And the test chip has been fabricated in 28 nm low-leakage logical process. The final silicon data indicated that the proposed implementation is efficient and reliable for memory testing. Furthermore, the test result also show that the yield of memory instances with BIST circuits in the test chip reached up to nearly 100%.",

These PUFs can be used as hardware security in security fields, such as authentication of devices and key generation in security applications. In order to know how the PUF circuits express the physical characteristics due to manufacturing process variations and provide a reference for researchers in the field of security, we briefly introduce the arbiter-based PUF and analyze the arbiter-based PUF in depth as it is a typical one of the silicon PUFs. Instead of paying attention to the whole PUF circuit which most studies do, we just focus on the stages so we can determine a demand of the arbiter. Monte Carlo simulation has been used to simulate the manufacturing process variations and the simulation is based on 40nm and 65nm technology libraries. Finally, a Monte Carlo-based statistical analysis has demonstrated that advanced technologies can enlarge intrinsic variation.",

How to accurately measure the memory random access time especially to measure the random access time of low density embedded memory has encounter so many challenges. The traditional timing measurement method which connects the external ports directly to the internal ports of memory is not feasible since it is of very low efficiency and very low precision. A new method which applies the built-in test circuit to measure embedded memory access time is presented in this paper. Based on 28nm logic process high speed SRAM test chip design as an example, this paper introduces a new timing measuring method as well as circuit design.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive subgradient methods are able to leverage the second-order information of functions to improve the regret, and have become popular for online learning and optimization. According to the amount of information used, adaptive subgradient methods can be divided into diagonal-matrix version (ADA-DIAG) and full-matrix version (ADA-FULL). In practice, ADA-DIAG is the most commonly adopted rather than ADA-FULL, because ADA-FULL is computationally intractable in high dimensions though it has smaller regret when gradients are correlated. In this paper, we propose to employ techniques of matrix approximation to accelerate ADA-FULL, and develop two methods based on random projections. Compared with ADA-FULL, at each iteration, our methods reduce the space complexity from (O(d^2)) to (O(tau d)) and the time complexity from (O(d^3)) to (O(tau ^2 d)) where d is the dimensionality of the data and (tau ll d) is the number of random projections. Experimental results about online convex optimization show that both methods are comparable to ADA-FULL and outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms including ADA-DIAG. Furthermore, the experiments of training convolutional neural networks show again that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms including ADA-DIAG.",

Based on the Norton models of flyback microinverters obtained by a small-signal modeling approach, potential harmonic resonances with the grid are analyzed. Following that, an impedance-based stability criterion is proposed, where the resonance frequency can be calculated and predicted based on the derived Norton models and the system admittance matrix of aggregated microinverters. After comprehensive analysis and comparisons, it is found that the peak-current-control-based flyback microinverters has better performance on damping the harmonic resonances than the current feedback controlled one. Simulations and experiments are carried out for verifying the effectiveness of the presented models and the correctness of the analysis results.",

Although studies have shown that other subtypes of IFN such as IFN-\u03b3 affects cell proliferation and differentiation to some extent, the effect of rhIFN-\u03b2 on chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is less known. In this study we studied the effect of rhIFN-\u03b2 on the chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs by inducing hMSCs into cartilage pellet via adding IFN-\u03b21a into regular TGF-\u03b23 chondrogenic differentiation medium. We collected the induced pellets and then detected GAG content, assessed pellets size, observed agreecan using alcian blue staining, and analyzed the expression of Sox and Collangen\u2161using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Addition of 100 ng/mL IFN-\u03b21a to regular TGF-\u03b23 chondrogenic differentiation medium could improve the concentration of GAG, increase the size of pellets, promote the formation of aggrecan and up-regulate the expression of CollangenII and Sox9. IFN-\u03b21a combined with TGF-\u03b23 could promote chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs.",

In this paper, the perturbation influences of parameters on the active power and frequency for a single-phase VSG are studied. Firstly, the small signal model of a VSG is established. Based on the time domain, the influences of parameters perturbation on dynamic indexes are analyzed in detail. It is found that the oscillation of power and frequency will be caused by unreasonable configurations of parameters. Seriously, it will cause the system instability. Then, a novel parameter adaptive adjustment strategy is proposed in this paper. An optimal damping ratio can be kept throughout the whole process of operation to suppress the oscillation of power and frequency. The stability of a VSG is enhanced since the dynamic indexes such as response time and overshoots are optimized. At last, the validity and correctness of the proposed method are verified by simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) has attracted wide attention because of the equivalent operating mechanism as a synchronous generator, providing a feasible scheme for the distributed generation connected to utility grid. However, the delivered power and frequency of the VSG may easily oscillate when the dramatic power fluctuation occurred in the distribution generation system. Fortunately, the oscillation can be damped though adjusting the rotating inertia and damping coefficient. Thus, to investigate the influences of parameters perturbation on the active power and frequency for a VSG, the small-signal model is derived and the dynamic performances are analyzed in detail. Then, based on the results of parameters analysis, an adaptive control strategy is proposed in this paper. And an optimal damping ratio can be maintained throughout the whole process of operation to suppress the oscillation of power and frequency. Therefore, the dynamic performances of the VSG are enhanced since the dynamic indexes such as the response time and overshoots are optimized. In the end, a prototype of single-phase VSG has been built and the proposed adaptive control strategy has been verified through experimental results.",

Firstly, the output impedance of droop control inverter is obtained by small signal method. And parameter sensitivity of the impedance is analyzed, which reveals that the lower-frequency impedance is sensitive to Q-U control parameters in droop control, and higher-frequency impedance is impacted by voltage loop control parameters and  $boldsymbol{C}$  value of LC filters. Then circulating resonance is analyzed based-on the derived output impedance. Through disturbing voltage loop control parameters and  $boldsymbol{C}$  value, it discloses that, resonant frequency is sensitive to  $boldsymbol{C}$  value, and the oscillation will be suppressed with increase of  $boldsymbol{C}$  value. However, the frequency is less sensitive to voltage loop parameters, and the resonance will be amplified by increasing voltage loop control parameters, especially voltage proportional control parameters. Finally, the circulating resonance is verified by simulations and experiments.",

With concave objective functions and/or nonlinear operation constraints, the centralized optimal dispatch of interconnected EHs is difficult to solve. In order to reduce the complexity of centralized optimal dispatch on large-scale systems and protect the information privacy of different EHs, a hierarchical optimization strategy is put forward for the ER-based energy internet. Specifically, the lower-level is the optimal dispatch within EHs, where the dispatch model of EH is further optimized by considering variable dispatch factors, and the information privacy of different EHs is preserved. The upper-level is the energy routing control between EHs, where the end-to-end power transmission according to contract path is realized through the controllability of ERs and energy routing protocols. Finally, the effectiveness of the hierarchical optimization strategy and model are verified by simulations.",

Exponents of hybrid multi-kernels are analyzed. The matrix of a hybrid multi-kernel is generated by a Kronecker-like product operation, and so are partial distances. All exponents of hybrid multi-kernels take values between the maximum and the minimum exponents among all constituent matrices.

The collection of RF information can be automatically accomplished with the minimization of drive testing (MDT) in long term evolution (LTE) networks. In the case of non-ideal cell detection, the proposed algorithm greatly decreases the calculation of RF information and the time of position estimation. We employed the proposed algorithm in LTE cellular networks including rural, urban and Hetnet cases. The results show that the proposed algorithm reduce by 76%, 34% and 70% in computation time in rural, urban and Hetnet case respectively, while the positioning errors (PEs) have been improved in comparison with the classic KNN algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes are a class of iteratively decodable codes, which can change code rate flexibly and be close to the Shannon limit. Empirical evidence suggests that GLDPC codes have advantages over standard low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in both of error floor and waterfall performance. In this paper, to further approach Shannon limit, the strategy of mixing single parity check (SPC) code with Hamming code to act as the component code of the check nodes (CNs) for GLDPC code is proposed. By using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart, we can estimate the decoding threshold and degree distribution through adjusting the proportion of SPC code and Hamming code over the binary erasure channel (BEC). With the aid of EXIT charts, we construct GLDPC code based on the best degree distribution. Simulation results show that, in comparison with standard LDPC codes and the state-of-the-art GLDPC codes with hybrid variable nodes (VNs), the GLDPC code proposed in this paper has better asymptotic performance.",

For both the phases, we find the direct application of log-domin belief propagation (BP) algorithm will lead to error. Hence, we propose an improved log-domin BP algorithm and it will be used in the two-phase decoding scheme. Since the two-phase decoding scheme has a large gain loss, we present a modified two-phase decoding scheme in order to further accelerate the convergence rate. Simulation results show that the modified two-phase decoder has a gain of about 0.2 dB compared to the two-phase decoder. Moreover, it also can reduce complexity by 33.4% in high SNR compared with the whole decoder.",

This study attempts to fill this gap through examining the spatiotemporal behavior of college students. The paper used a random 1% proportional sample of students in the Jinming Campus of Henan University, and collected the activity-travel diary and 7-day GPS tracking data. The day-to-day variability in activity-travel behavior was analyzed by standard deviation confidence ellipse analysis, kernel density analysis, a GIS based 3D geovisualisation method, and so on. The results reveal significant differences for activity and travel in time rhythm and time allocation both in one day and in a week. Hence, the infrastructure can be shared with surrounding residents by avoiding the daily peaks of college studentsu0027 activities. The results also suggest significant differences in activity tracks and activity space both in one day and in a week. The sharing potential can be improved through the spatial adjustment to network structure. Besides, the results shows that the spatiotemporal behavior can be measured by spatiotemporal trajectory data from smart-phones, which are powerful tools for uncovering the spatiotemporal model of infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "The frost-free period (FFP), first frost date (FFD) and last frost date (LFD) have been regard as the important climate variables for agricultural production. Understanding the spatio-temporal variations of the FFP, FFD and LFD is beneficial to reduce the harmful impacts of climate change on agricultural production and enhance the agricultural adaptation. This study examined daily minimum temperatures for 823 national-level meteorological stations, calculated the values of FFD, LFD and FFP for station-specific and region-specific from 1951 to 2012, estimated the gradients of linear regression for station-specific moving averages of FFD, LFD and FFP, and assessed station-specific time series of FFP and detected the abrupt change. The results as follows: at both the station level and the regional level, the FFP across China decreases with the increase of latitude from south to north, and with the increase of altitude from east to west generally. At the station level, the inter-annual fluctuations of FFD, LFD and FFP in south and west agricultural regions are greater than those in north and east. At the regional level, excluding the QT region, temporal changes of FFP are relatively small in both the low-latitude and the high-latitude regions, but for the mid-latitude regions. According to the linear trend gradients of the moving average values of station-specific FFD, LFD and FFP, FFD was delayed, LFD advanced, and FFP extended gradually over the 80% of China. Furthermore, the change magnitudes for FFD, LFD and FFP in the north and east agricultural regions are higher than that in the southern and western. Among the 659 station-specific time series of FFP examined by the Mann-Kendall test, 341 stations, located mainly in the north region, have one identifiable and significant abrupt change. And at the 341 stations with identified abrupt changes, most (57%) abrupt changes occurred during 1991\u20132012, followed by the periods of 1981\u20131990 (28%), 1971\u20131980 (12%), and 1951\u20131970 (3%). The spatio-temporal variations of FFD, LFD and FFP would provide important guidance to agricultural practices.",

        "title": "Spatial differentiation of daily travel carbon emissions in small- and medium-sized cities: An empirical study in Kaifeng, China",
        "abstract": "Abstract   Issues relating to low-carbon transportation have received increasing attention in recent years for two competing reasons: the effort to slow down global warming and the upward trend in private vehicle ownership in China. Residential carbon emissions and the mechanisms influencing them have been adequately addressed by the published literature. However, both the built environment and socio-economic factors are spatially heterogeneous within cities, and this can be expected to lead to a corresponding spatial heterogeneity in residential carbon emissions. To better characterize spatial heterogeneity in the mechanisms influencing carbon emissions, this study collected fine-scale spatially-distributed data pertaining to carbon emissions arising from the travel activities of residents in Kaifeng City. The spatial characteristics of and factors influencing household travel carbon emissions were then investigated using spatial auto-correlation analysis and the geographical weighted regression (GWR) method. The results show that areas with high values of household travel carbon emissions were primarily in the new urban development zone and in the more rapidly-expanding built-up areas in the outer layer of the city. Additionally, a large average distance between working and living locations in the newly-built commercial housing communities in the rapidly urbanizing areas is a leading factor increasing resident travel carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the long average distances traveled for schooling on account of the currently imbalanced development of education resources is another leading factor for increasing residential travel carbon emissions. The conclusions of this research elucidate the spatial heterogeneity in the mechanisms influencing residential travel carbon emissions within the city. In particular, this study confirms that urban sprawl is a leading factor in driving residential travel behavior and thus carbon emissions. More importantly, this study demonstrates that the documented inequality in resident travel-related carbon emissions does not result from economic (e.g., household income) inequality. Instead, it is caused by the existence of inequality in the allocation of socioeconomic infrastructure (e.g., schools). It is our expectation that the results of this study can be used as a valuable reference for planning low-carbon cities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper investigates the factors influencing industrial carbon emissions. The primary aim is to find a solution to mitigate CO 2  emissions from fossil combustion with rapid economic development and urbanization in coal principally consumed areas. The paper analyzes the effects of 7 factors on industrial carbon emissions and intensity in 18 cities in Henan Province from 2005 to 2015. The factors including energy structure, the index of industrial agglomeration, proportion of state-owned enterprises, proportion of collective enterprises, degree of industrialization, urbanization, foreign investment. The study establishes six panel models to analyze the influencing mechanism before and after the implementation policy on industrial clusters and carbon reduction. The results show that the carbon locking of energy structure has a path dependence. The increase of industrial agglomeration has a huge capacity of space spillover, which has broken the high carbon lock of coal to some extent. The degree of enterprise concentration to mitigate industrial carbon emissions needs to be improved. The inhibitory effect of foreign investment on carbon emissions has begun to highlight, but it has a certain policy directivity. Urbanization and industrialization have a phased impact on industrial carbon emission and emission intensity. The spatial interaction between industrial carbon emissions and its influencing factors provide new solutions to reduce carbon emissions.",

With large sample data and high-resolution remote sensing images, we explored the spatial differentiation and influencing factors of household embedded carbon emissions within the city fine scale using the EIO-LCA model and quantile regression. The results indicate that the factors of family characteristics, housing characteristics, lifestyles, and consumption concept have significant effects on the embedded carbon emissions of each person. The influencing intensity of most factors showed an increasing trend with increased carbon emissions. The application of the quantile regression (QR) method can more accurately reveal the different mechanisms of various influencing factors under different distribution functions and overcome the estimation error of the least square method on the mean level. The estimated results show that the influence strength of the remaining factors on embedded carbon emissions per capita showed a trend of increase with the increase in carbon emissions, but the influencing strength of housing types and frugal purpose for saving money have the tendency of zigzag fluctuation. To a certain extent, the result emphasized the necessity of specific emissions reduction measures for high carbon emissions groups.",

This study investigated monthly meteorological observation data of 79 meteorological stations from 1955 to 2014 to calculate the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at different time scales. The spatial and temporal characteristics and persistence of drought were analyzed. The results showed the following: (i) The drought trend is most apparent in spring (0.096/10a) and lower in summer (0.036/10a) and autumn (0.009/10a). (ii) A higher drought level indicates a lower frequency of droughts occurrence and vice versa. The frequency of light drought was highest (11.36%), while that of extreme drought was lowest (0.12%). (iii) The mean drought intensity was highest in summer, followed by spring, autumn, and winter. The drought intensity was mainly light, showing a pattern of severe drought in the northwest and light drought in the southeast. (iv) The Loess Plateau will continue a trend of drought in the future, but the season of the continuous intensity will differ. Droughts in spring and summer are highly persistent, autumn drought trends continue but may slow, and winter droughts become random events.",

        "abstract": "The accessibility of hospital facilities is of great importance not only for maintaining social stability, but also for protecting the basic human right to health care. Traditional accessibility research often lacks consideration of the dynamic changes in transport costs and does not reflect the actual travel time of urban residents, which is critical to time-sensitive hospital services. To avoid these defects, this study considered the city of Kaifeng, China, as an empirical case, and directly acquired travel time data for two travel modes to the hospital in different time periods through web mapping API (Application Program Interface). Further, based on travel time calculations, we compared five baseline indicators. For the last indicator, we used the optimal weighted accessibility model to measure hospital accessibility for each residential area. The study discovered significant differences in the frequency and spatial distribution of hospital accessibility using public transit and self-driving modes of transportation. In addition, there is an imbalance between accessibility travel times in the study area and the number of arrivals at hospitals. In particular, different modes of transportation and different travel periods also have a certain impact on accessibility of medical treatment. The research results shed new light on the accessibility of urban public facilities and provide a scientific basis with which local governments can optimize the spatial structure of hospital resources.",

        "abstract": "Antihypertensive peptides (AHTPs) are a group of small peptides with the main role to block key enzymes or receptors in the angiotensin genesis pathway. A great number of AHTPs have been isolated or digested from natural food resources; however, comprehensive studies on comparisons of AHTPs in various species from the perspective of big data are rare. Here, we established a simplified local AHTP database, and performed in situ mapping for high throughput identification of AHTPs with high antihypertensive activity from high-quality whole proteome datasets of 18 fish species. In the 35 identified AHTPs with reported high activity, we observed that Gly-Leu-Pro, Leu-Pro-Gly, and Val-Ser-Val are the major components of fish proteins, and AHTP hit numbers in various species demonstrated a similar distributing pattern. Interestingly, Atlantic salmon () is in possession of far more abundant AHTPs compared with other fish species. In addition, collagen subunit protein is the largest group with more matching AHTPs. Further exploration of two collagen subunits (col4a5 and col8a1) in more fish species suggested that the hit pattern of these conserved proteins among teleost is almost the same, and their phylogeny is consistent with the evolution of these fish species. In summary, our present study provides basic information for the relationship of AHTPs with fish proteins, which sheds light on rapid discovery of marine drugs or food additives from fish protein hydrolysates to alleviate hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzymes, ACE and ACE2, are two main elements in the renin\u207bangiotensin system, with a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure in vertebrates. Previous studies paid much attention to their physiological functions in model organisms, whereas the studies on other animals and related evolution have been sparse. Our present study performed a comprehensive genomic investigation on  and  genes in vertebrates. We successfully extracted the nucleotide sequences of  and  genes from high-quality genome assemblies of 36 representative vertebrates. After construction of their evolutionary tree, we observed that most of the phylogenetic positions are consistent with the species tree; however, certain differences appear in coelacanths and frogs, which may suggest a very slow evolutionary rate in the initial evolution of  and  in vertebrates. We further compared evolutionary rates within the entire sequences of  and , and determined that  evolved slightly faster than . Meanwhile, we counted that the exon numbers of  and  in vertebrates are usually 25 and 18 respectively, while certain species may occur exon fusion or disruption to decrease or increase their exon numbers. Interestingly, we found three homologous regions between  and , suggesting existence of gene duplication during their evolutionary process. In summary, this report provides novel insights into vertebrate  and  genes through a series of genomic and molecular comparisons.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a kind of polypeptide, angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitory peptide can lower the blood pressure of human body through restraining the formation of angiotensin \u2161. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of ACE inhibitory peptide on endothelial cell proliferation and endothelin expression in cultured human umbilical vein cells based on cellular and molecular levels in order to provide the experimental evidences for ACE inhibitory peptide to be the potential blood pressure-lowering health food. DESIGN: Repeated measures design. SETTING: School of Bioscience and Bioengineering, South China University of Technology; School of Applied Chemistry and Biological Technology, Shenzhen Polytechnic. MATERIALS: The experiment was carried out in the Institute of Applied Chemistry and Biological Technology, Shenzhen Polytechnic from September 2004 to March 2005. The ACE inhibitory peptide was provided by the Institute of Applied Chemistry and Biological Technology, Shenzhen Polytechnic. Under certain circumstance, 15 \u03bcmol/L of the inhibitor was needed to decrease half of the ACE activity. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells of the 4th generation were cultured randomly in 7 groups with different concentrations: medium group, 150, 300 and 600 mg/L ACE inhibitory peptide groups, captopril group, norepinephrine(NE) group, and ACE inhibitory peptide+NE group. METHODS: \u2460The endothelial cells were cultured as recommended. The medium was M199+FBS(0.15, v/v)+penicillin(10 000 U/mL)+streptomycin(100 mg/L). After cellular fusion, the cells were carried on the passage with the ratio of 1\u22362. The 4th generation cells were used for experiment. \u2461M199(0.15, v/v) was contained in each group. ACE inhibitory peptides were added to make the final concentration 150, 300 and 600 mg/L in the 150, 300 and 600 mg/L ACE inhibitory peptide groups respectively. Captopril was added to make the final concentration 10-5 mol/L in the captopril group. NE was added to make the final concentration 100 \u03bcg/L in the NE group. ACE inhibitory peptide and NE were added to make the final concentration 300 mg/L and 100 \u03bcg/L in the ACE inhibitory peptide+NE group respectively. \u2462The state of cell growth was determined with cytometry. The contents of endothelial cells in the medium with different culture times were determined with radioimmunoassay. The expression of endothelin mRNA was determined with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The expression of cellular endothelin protein was determined with immunohistochemical method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \u2460The influence of ACE inhibitory peptide on endothelial cell proliferation. \u2461The influence of ACE inhibitory peptide on the endothelin mRNA and endothelin protein. RESULTS: \u2460The influence of ACE inhibitory peptide on endothelial cell proliferation and endothelin secretion: Compared with the medium group, in the captopril and 150, 300, 600 mg/L ACE inhibitory peptide groups, the growth of endothelial cells was restrained and the endothelin content in the medium was lowered(P < 0.01 or 0.05). NE could promote the growth of endothelial cells and the secretion of endothelin, but the cell density and endothelin content after treatment with ACE inhibitory peptide were similar to those in the medium group(P > 0.05). \u2461The influence of ACE inhibitory peptide on the expressions of endothelin mRNA and protein in endothelial cells: Compared with the medium group, the expressions of endothelin mRNA and protein might be lowered in the captopril and 150, 300, 600 mg/L ACE inhibitory peptide groups(P < 0.01 or 0.05). The expressions of endothelin mRNA and protein could be up-regulated by NE. The gene expression after treatment with ACE inhibitory peptide was similar to that in the medium group(P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The ACE inhibitory peptides of different dosages can all restrain the growth of endothelial cells, lower the endothelin content, decrease the expression of endothelin gene and resist NE improved growth and secretion of endothelial cells in umbilical vein cell effectively.",

        "abstract": "An optimal antihypertensive peptide (AHP), KVLPVP, was linked to form a six-copy of tandem dotetracontapeptide with the specific cleavage site (Arg-X) of clostripain. The gene of the dotetracontapeptide was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. After a 5 h induction with 1.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the recombinant AHP fused with glutathione-S-transferase tag reached the maximal production, 24.6% of total intracellular protein. Following digestion with clostripain and carboxypeptidase B, the product was separated with ultrafiltration and reversed-phase HPLC, and 170 mg of pure recombinant AHP was obtained from 1 L of E. coli culture. The IC50 of the recombinant AHP was 4.6 microM. The systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats could be decreased dramatically by the recombinant AHP in a dose-dependent manner after delivering 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of body weight (BW) or 0.6 mg of AHP/kg of BW orally. The strong antihypertensive effect was reached 4-24 h after oral administration of 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of BW, and the peak point was at the fourth hour (-21.4 +/- 7.2 mm of Hg). This study overcame traditional enzymatic digestion problems in preparing AHP and established a novel approach for industrial production of AHP.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms facilitating hypertension in diabetes still remain to be elucidated. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a higher risk factor for insulin resistance, shares many predisposing factors with diabetes. However, little work has been performed on the pathogenesis of hypertension in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with NAFLD. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of hypertension in different glycemic statuses and to analyze relationships between NAFLD, metabolic risks, and hypertension within a large community-based population after informed written consent. A total of 9473 subjects aged over 45 years, including 1648 patients with T2DM, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Clinical and biochemical parameters of all participants were determined. The results suggested that the patients with prediabetes or T2DM were with higher risks to have hypertension. T2DM with NAFLD had significantly higher levels of blood pressure, triglyceride, uric acid, and HOMA-IR than those without NAFLD. Data analyses suggested that hypertriglyceridemia [OR\u2009=\u20091.773 (1.396, 2.251)], NAFLD [OR\u2009=\u20092.344 (1.736, 3.165)], hyperuricemia [OR\u2009=\u20091.474 (1.079, 2.012)], and insulin resistance [OR\u2009=\u20091.948 (1.540, 2.465)] were associated with the higher prevalence of hypertension independent of other metabolic risk factors in type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to focus on these associations.",

Based on a vehicle road test under the condition of downhill, complicated stick-slip type motion of caliper and its correlation with the interior noise were analyzed. In order to duplicate these brake creep groan phenomena, a transient dynamic model including brake corner and subsystems was established using finite element method. In the model, brake components were considered to be flexible body, and the subsystems including driveline, suspension, tire, and vehicle body were considered to be rigid body. Simulation and experimental results of caliper vibration in time and frequency domains were compared. It was demonstrated that the new model is effective for the prediction and analysis of brake creep groan, and it has higher accuracy compared to the previous model without the subsystems. It is also found that the lining and caliper not only have stick-slip motion in each coordinate direction but also have translational and torsional movements in plane, which relate to the microscopic sticking and slipping, friction coefficient, and forces, as well as the contact status at the friction interface.",

In this paper, a multipoint contact flexible pin-on-disc system is established considering tangential stiffness. Then influence of contact stiffness and friction coefficient with heterogeneous distribution on frictional squeal is studied using the complex modal analysis. The research shows that contact stiffness and friction coefficient heterogeneities influence the likelihood of occurrence of the squeal, the frequency of the squeal, and the real part of the complex eigenvalue of the system. And when the contact stiffness and friction coefficient are close to the boundary of the region of mode-coupling instability, flexible pin-on-disc system with homogeneous contact stiffness and friction coefficient cannot predict whether frictional squeal occurs or not. Besides, uncertain distribution of contact stiffness and friction coefficient can induce the uncertainty of brake squeal.",

The Fourier spectrum of the bridge response due to vehicle loading exhibits complicated cluster bands in addition to multiple peaks, some of which are correlated with the bridge natural modes characterized by finite element method analysis and free decay testing, and some of which are correlated with the vehicle dynamic load spectrum. To characterize the unidentified narrow band in the bridge response spectrum, the Lyapunov exponent of the response is estimated, which is found to be a positive value indicating the nonlinear properties of the bridge\u2019s large response under vehicle loading.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the creep groan of a vehicle\u2019s brake experimentally, analytically, and numerically. Experimentally, the effects of acceleration on caliper and strut, noise, brake pressure, and tension are measured. The results show that the measured signals and their relevant spectra broadly capture the complex vibrations of creep groan. This includes the simple stick-slip, severe stick-slip vibrations/resonances, multiple harmonics, half-order harmonics; stick-slip-induced impulsive vibrations, steady/unstable vibrations, and their transitions. Analytically, a new mathematical model is presented to capture the unique features of half-order harmonics and the connections to fundamental stick-slip/resonant frequency and multiple harmonics. The analytical solution and the experimental results show that the vibro-impact of the brake pad-disc system can be triggered by severe stick-slip vibrations and is associated with instable, impulsive stick-slip vibration with wideband. The induced stick-slip vibro-impact can evolve into a steady and strong state with half-order, stick-slip fundamental, and multiple-order components. This new mechanism is different from all previously proposed mechanisms of creep groan in that we also view some type of creep groan as a stick-slip vibration-induced vibro-impact phenomenon in addition to conventional stick-slip phenomena. The new mechanism comprehensively explains the complex experimental phenomena reported in the literature. Numerically, the salient features of phase diagrams of instable stick-slip and vibro-impact are examined by using a seven-degree-of-freedom brake system model, which shows that the phase diagrams of the dynamics of creep groan with and without vibro-impact are substantially different. The phase diagram of the dynamics with vibro-impact is closer to the experimental results. In contrast to existing mechanisms, the proposed new mechanism encompasses the instable stick-slip nature of creep groan and elaborates the inherent connections and transition of the spectrogram. The new knowledge can be used to attain critical improvements to brake noise and vibration analysis and design. By applying the proposed new model in addition to existing models, all experimental phenomena in creep groan are elaborated and quantified.",

For some remote systems, a method that can automatically and objectively evaluate the illumination quality of a face image in a human-like manner is highly desired. However, few studies have been conducted in this area. To fill this research gap to some extent, we make two contributions in this paper. Firstly, in order to facilitate the study of illumination quality prediction for face images, a large-scale database, namely, Face Image Illumination Quality Database (FIIQD), is established. FIIQD contains 224,733 face images with various illumination patterns and for each image there is an associated illumination quality score. Secondly, based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), a novel highly accurate model for predicting the illumination quality of face images is proposed.

        "abstract": "Adiposity phenotypes, estimated by higher body adiposity index (BAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and cardiometabolic index (CMI), has conferred increased metabolic risk. The relative contribution of BAI, LAP, and CMI in hyperuricemia, however, is unknown. We hypothesized that these obesity indicators would refine identification of hyperuricemia. Information on serum uric acid (SUA), fasting lipid profiles, and body adiposity measures (BAI, LAP, and CMI) were recorded in a cross-sectional population-based sample of 11,102 participants (\u2265\u200935\u00a0years old) from China. BAI, LAP, and CMI were strong independent predictors of SUA in both sexes after correction for potential confounders. In multivariable models, odds ratio (OR) for hyperuricemia for 1 SD increment in BAI, LAP, and CMI were 1.361 (95% CI, 1.224-1.513), 1.393 (95% CI, 1.273-1.525), and 1.332 (95% CI, 1.224-1.448) in females, respectively. For males, these adiposity indices corresponded to an increased hyperuricemia risk of 14, 47, and 33%, respectively. Additionally, compared to the bottom category, females with the top quartile of BAI, LAP, and CMI showed higher adjusted odds of having hyperuricemia, with ORs of 2.064, 7.500, and 4.944, respectively. ORs for hyperuricemia were statistically significant in the fourth quartile of BAI (1.622 [1.258-2.091]), LAP (5.549 [3.907-7.880]), and CMI (3.878 [2.830-5.313]) of male subgroup. Accumulation of ectopic adiposity in general (quantified by increased BAI), and of visceral adipose tissue in particular (reflected by elevated LAP and CMI), provided important insight regarding hyperuricemia risk and might potentially shed further light on our understanding of the metabolic sequelae of obesity.",

        "abstract": "As the secondary widely used battery, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become the core component of the energy supply for most devices. Accurately predicting the current cycle time of LIBs is of great importance to ensure the reliability and safety of the equipment. In this paper, considering the nonlinear and non-Gaussian capacity degradation characteristics of LIBs, a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method based on the exponential model and the particle filter is proposed. The cycle life test data of LIBs published by prognostics center of excellence in national aeronautics and space administration were exponentially experiencing the rule of degradation. And then the extrapolation method was used to get the quantitative expression of the uncertainty of life expectancy of LIBs, i.e. the prediction mean and the probability distribution histogram. The prognostic horizon index and the new specific accuracy index were applied to evaluate the prediction performance. Moreover, the prediction error under different prediction starting points is given. Compared with other methods such as the auto-regressive integrated moving average model, the fusion nonlinear degradation autoregressive model and the regularized particle filter algorithm, the proposed algorithm has a better prediction performance. According to the accuracy index, the proposed prediction method has better prediction accuracy and convergence. The RUL prediction for LIBs can provide a better decision support for the maintenance and support systems to optimize maintenance strategies, and reduce maintenance costs.",

        "abstract": "Aircraft service process is in a state of the composite load of pressure and temperature for a long period of time, which inevitably affects the inherent characteristics of some components in aircraft accordingly. The flow field of aircraft wing materials under different Mach numbers is simulated by Fluent in order to extract pressure and temperature on the wing in this paper. To determine the effect of coupling stress on the wing&rsquo;s material and structural properties, the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method is used in ANSYS-Workbench to calculate the stress that is caused by pressure and temperature. Simulation analysis results show that with the increase of Mach number, the pressure and temperature on the wing&rsquo;s surface both increase exponentially and thermal stress that is caused by temperature will be the main factor in the coupled stress. When compared with three kinds of materials, titanium alloy, aluminum alloy, and Haynes alloy, carbon fiber composite material has better performance in service at high speed, and natural frequency under coupling pre-stressing will get smaller.",

        "abstract": "Equivalent circuit models are a hot research topic in the field of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, and scholars have proposed a variety of equivalent circuit models, from simple to complex. On one hand, a simple model cannot simulate the dynamic characteristics of batteries; on the other hand, it is difficult to apply a complex model to a real-time system. At present, there are few systematic comparative studies on equivalent circuit models of lithium-ion batteries. The representative first-order resistor-capacitor (RC) model and second-order RC model commonly used in the literature are studied comparatively in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of the two models are identified experimentally; secondly, the simulation model is built in Matlab/Simulink environment, and finally the output precision of these two models is verified by the actual data. The results show that in the constant current condition, the maximum error of the first-order RC model is 1.65% and the maximum error for the second-order RC model is 1.22%. In urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) condition, the maximum error of the first-order RC model is 1.88%, and for the second-order RC model the maximum error is 1.69%. This is of great instructional significance to the application in practical battery management systems for the equivalent circuit model of lithium-ion batteries of electric vehicles.",

Fluorescent spectra show that H 2 L can be used to detect Al 3+  ions not only in ethanol, but also in DMF and DMSO. The enhancement of fluorescent intensity can be observed by naked-eye. And the detection limit can reach 10 \u22129 \u202fM. The Job\u2019s plot,  1 H NMR titration, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) results show that Al 3+  ions and H 2 L form a 2:1 complex.

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are increasingly used in mobile applications where mechanical vibrations and shocks are a constant companion. There is evidence both in the academic and industrial communities to suggest that the electrical performance and mechanical properties of the lithium-ion cells of an electric vehicle (EV) are affected by the road-induced vibration. However, only a few studies related to the effects of vibration on the degradation of electrical performance of lithium-ion batteries have been approached. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the effects of vibration on the DC resistance, 1C capacity and consistency of NCR18650BE lithium-ion cells. Based on mathematical statistics, the method changes of the DC resistance and the capacity of the cells both before and after the test were analyzed with a large sample size. The results identified that a significant increase in DC resistance was observed as a result of vibration at the 95% confidence level, while typically a reduction in 1C capacity was also noted. In addition, based on a multi-feature quantity, a clustering algorithm was adopted to analyze the effect of vibration on cell consistency; the results show that the cell consistency had deteriorated after the vibration test.",

However lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for EVs have high capacity, and large serial/parallel numbers, when coupled with problems like safety, durability, uniformity, and cost imposes limitations on the wide application of lithium-ion batteries in EVs. These LIBs face a major challenge of battery life, which research has shown can be extended by cell balancing. The common areas under which these batteries operate with safety and reliability require the effective control and management of battery health systems. A great deal of research is being carried out to see that this technology does not lead to failure in the applications, as its failure may lead to catastrophes or lessen performance. This paper, through an analytical review of the literature, gives a brief introduction to battery management system (BMS), opportunities, and challenges, and provides a future research agenda on battery health management. With issues raised in this review paper, further exploration is essential.",

        "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are popular today as their applications spans from portable electronics, electric vehicles, military, and aerospace applications. These batteries form a core component of these systems making them critical to the systems functional capability. Remaining useful life prediction is essential therefore as failure to which can lead to reduced performance, and or even catastrophic failure. The remaining useful life estimates are obtained by evaluating successive probability distributions of degrading states. If battery capacity is less than the failure threshold it poses a major danger to electric vehicles. This is because the battery capacity is an important indicator to monitor state of health (SOH), and its value can be less than the failure threshold due to degradation. This paper makes use of NASAu0027s battery dataset to form the observed data sequence for prediction of remaining useful life. Afterwards a particle filter (PF) algorithm is used to perform the prediction of remaining useful life.",

        "abstract": "A unique general, large-scale, simple, and cost-effective strategy, i.e., foaming-assisted electrospinning, for fabricating various transition metal oxides into ultrafine nanoparticles (TMOs UNPs) that are uniformly embedded in hierarchically porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) has been developed. Taking advantage of the strong repulsive forces of metal azides as the pore generator during carbonization, the formation of uniform TMOs UNPs with homogeneous distribution and HPCNFs is simultaneously implemented. The combination of uniform ultrasmall TMOs UNPs with homogeneous distribution and hierarchically porous carbon nanofibers with interconnected nanostructure can effectively avoid the aggregation, dissolution, and pulverization of TMOs, promote the rapid 3D transport of both Li ions and electrons throughout the whole electrode, and enhance the electrical conductivity and structural integrity of the electrode. As a result, when evaluated as binder-free anode materials in Li-ion batteries, they displayed extraordinary electrochemical properties with outstanding reversible capacity, excellent capacity retention, high Coulombic efficiency, good rate capability, and superior cycling performance at high rates. More importantly, the present work opens up a wide horizon for the fabrication of a wide range of ultrasmall metal/metal oxides distributed in 1D porous carbon structures, leading to advanced performance and enabling their great potential for promising large-scale applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanostructures have been intensively investigated because of their intriguing features and great potential for practical application in various fields. This paper reports the controllable fabrication of carbon hollow nanobubbles on porous carbon nanofibers (CHNBs@PCNFs) through a general electrospinning strategy, with metal azides serving as both a bubbling and a porogen reagent. The strong repulsive forces resulting from the intense release of N 2  from the decomposition of metal azides upon carbonization leads to the uniform formation of porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs), which could be facile tuned by heating rates and the amount of the bubbling reagent, simultaneously constructed with carbon hollow nanobubbles (CHNBs) on the surface. Density functional theory calculations reveal the strong interactions between terminal Na atoms in sodium polysulfides and N and O atoms doped into CHNBs@PCNFs, which could effectively alleviate the shuttle effect of Na-S batteries via adsorbing and trapping polysulfides. With strong adsorption capability of sodium polysulfides and high electrical conductivity, these CHNBs@PCNFs are demonstrated to be an ideal sulfur host in room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries, which delivers a high reversible capacity of 256\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121  (specific energy density 384\u202fW\u202fh\u202fkg \u22121 ) with a low decay rate of 0.044% per cycle at 2 C-rate. When CHNBs@PCNFs used as functional supports for MgH 2  nanoparticles, a significantly enhanced hydrogen storage performance was achieved. The present work represents a critically important step in advancing the electrospinning technique for generating 1D carbon nanostructures in a facile and universal manner.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that some viruses can manipulate the infection process by packing specific viral and cellular components into exosomes, small nanometer-sized (30-150 nm) vesicles secreted from various cells. However, the impact of HBV replication on the content of exosomes produced by hepatocytes has not been fully delineated. In this work, an HBV-inducible cell line HepAD38 was used to directly compare changes in the protein content of exosomes secreted from HepAD38 cells with or without HBV replication. Exosomes were isolated from supernantants of HepAD38 cells cultured with or without doxycycline (dox) and their purity was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Western immunoblotting assays. Ion-intensity based label-free LC-MS/MS quantitation technologies were applied to analyze protein content of exosomes from HBV replicating cells [referred as HepAD38 (dox)-exo] and from HBV nonreplicating cells [referred as HepAD38 (dox)-exo]. A total of 1412 exosomal protein groups were identified, among which the abundance of 35 proteins was significantly changed following HBV replication. Strikingly, 5 subunit proteins from the 26S proteasome complex, including PSMC1, PSMC2, PSMD1, PSMD7 and PSMD14 were consistently enhanced in HepAD38 (dox)-exo. Bioinformatic analysis of differential exosomal proteins confirmed the significant enrichment of components involved in the proteasomal catabolic process. Proteasome activity assays further suggested that HepAD38 (dox)-exo had enhanced proteolytic activity compared with HepAD38 (dox)-exo. Furthermore, human peripheral monocytes incubated with HepAD38 (dox)-exo induced a significantly lower level of IL-6 secretion compared with IL-6 levels from HepAD38 (dox)-exo. Irreversible inhibition of proteasomal activity within exosomes restored higher production of IL-6 by monocytes, suggesting that transmission of proteasome subunit proteins by HepAD38 (dox)-exo might modulate the production of pro-inflammatory molecules in the recipient monocytes. These results revealed the composition and potential function of exosomes produced during HBV replication, thus providing a new perspective on the role of exosomes in HBV-host interaction.",

Its extension to the 3D theory however requires many secondary sources and a high computational complexity. In this paper, a weighted mode matching approach is developed for 2.5D multizone reproduction. The multizone soundfield is reproduced in the horizontal plane within a circular control region using the loudspeakers modelled as 3D point sources. We propose weighting the Bessel-spherical harmonic modes for 2.5D reproduction and a matching between the desired and reproduced soundfields over the entire control region. Simulation results show that in comparison with the conventional 2.5D reproduction method a more accurate reproduction is achieved using the proposed weighting approach.",

We then propose an active control strategy to correct the scattering effect.

To control the free-floating manipulator (FFM) accurately, we propose an eye-in-hand visual servo controller with a disturbance compensator (DC-VSC).

But we can still conduct the identification of block ciphers under CBC mode if enough ciphertext streams are available. In this paper, we consider the identification of 5 frequently used block ciphers, AES, DES, 3DES, RC5 and Blowfish. For multi-class identification, the identification rate of 5 block ciphers can reach above 90% as long as the size of ciphertext file is larger than 100 KB when same key and same IV for training and testing ciphertext files. For one to one identification, we identify AES from other 4 block ciphers on condition of different keys or different IVs for training and testing ciphertext files. We can obtain an identification rate of above 97% when the size of ciphertext file is equal to 100 KB. Besides, even if the size of ciphertext file is only 4 KB, the average identification rate is still higher than 80%.",

Methods: The experiment was carried out in the Department of Medical Laboratory, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Area Command of Chinese PLA in September 2003. Polyethylenimide (jetPEITM) mediated pcDNA3.1-bFGF recombinant vector was transferred into primarily cultured osteoblasts. After 36 hours, the expression of bFGF and its biological activities were detected with immunohistochemisty, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunoadsordent assay (ELISA) and methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetry. Results: The pcDNA3.1-bFG F transfected osteoblasts could express bFGF protein into the cellular culture medium, the concentration was higher than that in the non-transfected one [(1.56\u00b10.08), (0.53\u00b10.048) ng/mL, P < 0.01]. 2 The supernatant of transfected osteoblasts could obviously accelerate the proliferation of 3T3 cells,which indicated that the osteoblasts secreted and expressed bFGF had certain biological activities. Conclusion: The bFGF gene can transfer into periosteal oste oblasts, and the transfected osteoblasts can overexpress bFGF.",

        "abstract": "Aim: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) could repair the bone defects. Many in vivo and vitro experiments have suggested that exogenous implantation of bFGF could significantly improve bone formation. In this study, the influence of bFGF gene transfection on osteoblast growth was observed. Methods: The experiment was performed in the Medical Laboratory, Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from January to July 2003. Adult male New Zealand rabbits of 1.5-25 kg were selected. Primarily cultured osteoblasts were transfected with pcDNA3.1-bFGF and pEGFP-C3-bFGF recombinant vector by polyethyleneimine (jetPEI\u2122). The transfected and non-transfected osteoblasts were digested and collected. Cell counting was performed by blood cell counter and the cell growth curve was drawn. Meanwhile, the changes in DNA concentration, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC) were detected. Results: 1 The stable phase of non-transfected osteoblasts started since the 8th day, while the transfected osteoblasts since the 10th day. The cell number of transfected cells was significantly higher than that of non-transfected osteoblasts [(1.70\u00b10.02)\u00d7109 L-1, (2.10\u00b10.03)\u00d7109 L-1, P < 0.05]. 2 The synthetical quantity of DNA was the highest, about (255\u00b120) mg/L, in pcDNA3.1-bFGF-transfected osteoblasts, while that in pEGFP-C3-bFGF-transfected cells was about (225\u00b120) mg/L, and non-transfected osteoblasts was (100\u00b110) mg/L. 3 On day 9, the synthetical quantity of ALP in pcDNA3.1-bFGF-transfected osteoblasts was (8.0\u00b10.22) IU/mL, while in non-transfected cells was (13.12\u00b10.18) IU/mL, similar to that of pEGFP-C3-bFGF-transfected cells (12.56\u00b10.24) IU/mL. 4 The change tendency of OC was nearly the same to ALP with time. But there was no significant difference in OC synthetical quantity between transfected and non-transfected osteoblasts (P > 0.05). Conclusion: After transfected by pcDNA3.1-bFGF and pEGFP-C3-bFGF recombinant vector, the growth of osteoblasts changes a little, and is nearly identical with that of exogenous bFGF. 2 Cells transfected by peDNA3.1-bFGF could secrete bFGF, promote cell division and proliferation, decrease the expression of ALP, while pEGFP-C3-bFGF-transfected osteoblast could not secrete bFGF, so has little influence on osteoblasts.",

We determined that serum calprotectin level (ng/ml) was higher in AS (15.30\u2009\u00b1\u20096.49) and nr-axSpA (17.76\u2009\u00b1\u20098.59) patients than in healthy individuals (7.40\u2009\u00b1\u20092.67). No difference was observed in calprotectin level between these two groups. Elevated calprotectin was positively correlated with ESR, CRP, BASDAI, and ASDAS as well as SPARCC scoring and had no correlation with BASFI and mSASSS. No correlation was observed between calprotectin and Wnt/-catenin pathway markers. Serum calprotectin can be used as a marker for inflammation in both nr-axSpA and AS, while it does not contribute to the discrimination of AS and nr-axSpA. Calprotectin-mediated inflammation was not correlated with principle effectors of Wnt/-catenin pathway, indicating that inflammation and bone fusion might be separate processes of the disease.",

Patients enrolled all had predominant organ involvement including proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, pericardial effusion, and cerebral involvement requiring corticosteroid pulse treatment. Fifty-two patients in study group received IAS plus corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide treatment. Fifty-two patients in non-IAS group received corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide treatment. Outcome measurement included C3, dsDNA, AnuA, and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) 2k score and in particular cases, proteinuria quantification and platelet count. Disease activity dropped significantly in both groups. Improvement of disease activity markers was more significant in study group than that in non-IAS group. The lower dosage of steroid in study group suggested the steroid-sparing effect of IAS. No severe adverse effect occurred during IAS. Our study suggested IAS as an additional therapy to steroid pulse and immunosuppressant in treating severe SLE. ",

The maize (Zea mays L.) husk consists of multiple leafy layers and plays important roles in protecting the ear from pathogen infection and in preventing grain dehydration. Although husk morphology varies widely among different maize inbred lines, the genetic basis of such variation is poorly understood. In this study, we used three maize recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations to dissect the genetic basis of three husk traits: i.e., husk length (HL), husk width (HW), and the number of husk layers (HN). Three husk traits in all three RIL populations showed wide phenotypic variation and high heritability. The HL showed stronger correlations with ear traits than did HW and HN. A total of 21 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for the three traits in three RIL populations, and some of them were commonly observed for the same trait in different populations. The proportions of total phenotypic variation explained by QTL in three RIL populations were 31.8, 35.3, and 44.5% for HL, HW, and HN, respectively. The highest proportions of phenotypic variation explained by a single QTL were 14.7% for HL in the By815/K22 RIL population (BYK), 13.5% for HW in the By815/DE3 RIL population (BYD), and 19.4% for HN in the BYD population. A combined analysis of linkage mapping with a previous genome-wide association study revealed five candidate genes related to husk morphology situated within three QTL loci. These five genes were related to metabolism, gene expression regulation, and signal transduction.",

        "abstract": "Sucrose (Suc) transporters (SUCs or SUTs) are important regulators in plant growth and stress tolerance. However, the mechanism of SUCs in plant abiotic stress resistance remains to be dietermined. Here, we found that AtSUC9 expression was induced by abiotic stress, including salt, osmotic and cold stress conditions. Disruption of AtSUC9 led to sensitive responses to abiotic stress during seed germination and seedling growth. Further analyses indicated that the sensitivity phenotype of Atsuc9 mutants resulted from higher Suc content in shoots and lower Suc content in roots, as compared with that in wild-type (WT) plants. In addition, we found that the expression of AtSUC9 is induced in particular by low levels of exogenous and endogenous Suc, and deletion of AtSUC9 affected the expression of the low Suc level-responsive genes. AtSUC9 also showed an obvious response to treatments with low concentrations of exogenous Suc during seed germination, seedling growth and Suc distribution, and Atsuc9 mutants hardly grew in abiotic stress treatments without exogenous Suc. Moreover, our results illustrated not only that deletion of AtSUC9 blocks abiotic stress-inducible ABA accumulation but also that Atsuc9 mutants had a lower content of endogenous ABA in stress conditions than in normal conditions. Deletion of AtSUC9 also inhibited the expression of many ABA-inducible genes (SnRk2.2/3/6, ABF2/3/4, ABI1/3/4, RD29A, KIN1 and KIN2). These results indicate that AtSUC9 is induced in particular by low Suc levels then mediates the balance of Suc distribution and promotes ABA accumulation to enhance Arabidopsis abiotic stress resistance.",

Plants with different carbonreduction cycles respond differently to strong light stress. However, variationin photoinhibition in leaves with different photosynthetic characteristics inmaize is not clear. In this experiment, we used the first leaves (with anincomplete C4 cycle) and fifth leaves (with a complete C4 cycle) of maize plants as well as the fifth leaves (C3 cycle) oftobacco plants as a reference to measure the photosynthetic rate (PN)and chlorophyll a parameters under strong light stress. During treatment, PN,the maximal fluorescence (Fm), the maximal quantum yield of PSIIphotochemistry (Fv/Fm), and the number of activephotosystem II (PSII) reaction centers per excited cross-section (RC/CSm)declined dramatically in all three types of leaves but to different degrees. PN,Fm, Fv/Fm, and RC/CSm were lessinhibited by strong light in C4 leaves. The results showed thatmaize C4 leaves with higher rates of photosynthesis are moretolerant to strong light stress than incomplete C4 leaves, and thecarbon reduction cycle is more important to photoprotection in C4 leaves, while state transition is critical in incomplete C4 leaves.",

        "abstract": "Brace roots are vital constituents of the root system in maize. Their contribution to plant development is affected by brace-root traits (BRTs) including tier number (TN), root number (RN) and radius of the brace root (RBR). However, the genetic control of BRTs still remains elusive. Here, we have identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from 207 recombinant inbred lines of BY815/K22 grown in three environments to dissect the genetic architecture of BRTs in maize. All three of BRTs were highly heritable and were affected by genotype, environment and the interaction between them. RBR was positively correlated with both RN and TN. Eight QTLs were identified, 3 for TN, 3 for RN and 2 for RBR, and located on chromosome 1, 2, 9 and 10. They together explained 26.4% (TN), 21.5% (RN) and 13.4% (RBR) of phenotypic variation. Sixty of annotated genes were identified from the narrower QTLs by the bin-map method, including genes for signal transduction, gene expression regulation, and metabolism and related processes. The results also show that the interaction may occur between QTLs for BRTs. Our results can help to further study the genetic basis of BRTs and improve the approaches to control maize brace-root system through SNP marker-assisted selection.",

Fault-tolerant real-time scheduling provides a method of combining timing requirements and faults tolerance for real-time systems. This paper presents a preliminary study of building a fault-tolerant real-time mechanism for seL4 microkernel. seL4, as the first formally-verified operating system kernel in the world, is an ideal platform for security-critical systems. However, the lack of real-time and fault-tolerant policy reduces its the reliability and user experience. We have implemented basic real-time and checkpoint mechanisms in seL4, and propose the Check-Point based Fault-Tolerant RM (CP-FTRM) scheduling policy.

        "abstract": "Traditional mobile ad hoc networks are assumed to be homogeneous networks that nodes have single radio interface. Nodes moving fast and randomly, so they usually suffer from frequent link failures and less communication opportunities. In order to improve the network performance, heterogeneous ad hoc networks with multiple radio interfaces are involved. There are many routing protocols for traditional ad hoc networks such as DSR, AODV and AOMDV but few work well in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, a multipath protocol based on AOMDV with node stability and link quality for networks where nodes have multiple radio-interfaces is proposed and the node stability by number of neighbors, neighbor similarity between adjacent time and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is defined. The path quality is measured by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The protocol takes the neighborsu0027 average node stability as a reference to select the most stable interface to broadcast RREQ and find at least one path between source and destination. At any time, the protocol always selects the path with the largest path quality value for transmission. By evaluating the delivery, delay and overhead performance on NS-2, the effectiveness of proposed protocol is validated in the end.",

Current OKL4 technology has overcome some limitations of plain virtualization by introducing microkernel approach but also imposes several concerns including incomplete IPC (Inter-Process Communication). With this in mind, in this paper a novel asynchronous communication mechanism to optimize original OKL4 IPC mechanism is proposed. The mechanism is able to effectively deal with concurrent communication requests between any virtual machines (VMs) by generating multiple event channels and providing a complete management mechanism. Further, a shared-memory-based bulk data transfer mechanism based on asynchronous communication mechanism is proposed to enrich OKL4 primitive data exchange approaches. In the end, the promising experiment results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "The critical pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), the main constituent of amyloid plaques. \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes amyloidogenic cleavage by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase generating A\u03b2 at endosomes or non-amyloidogenic processing by \u03b1-secretase precluding the production of A\u03b2 at the plasma membrane. Recently, several natural products have been widely researched on the prevention of A\u03b2 accumulation for AD treatment. We previously reported that Lycoris chejuensis K. Tae et S. Ko (CJ), which originated from Jeju Island in Korea, improved the disrupted memory functions and reduced A\u03b2 production in vivo. Here, we further explored the effect of its active component, 7-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine (coded as E144), on A\u03b2 generation and the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that E144 reduced the level of APP, especially its mature form, in HeLa cells overexpressing human APP with the Swedish mutation. Concomitantly, E144 decreased the levels of A\u03b2, sAPP\u03b2, sAPP\u03b1, and C-terminal fragment. In addition, administration of E144 normalized the behavioral deficits in Tg2576 mice, an APP transgenic mouse model of AD. E144 also decreased the A\u03b2 and APP levels in the cerebral cortex of Tg2576 mice. Thus, we propose that E144 could be a potential drug candidate for an anti-amyloid disease-modifying AD therapy.",

        "abstract": "The dysregulation of the serotonergic system has long been recognized as an important factor underlying the pathophysiology of PTSD. To date, SSRIs have already been established as the firstline pharmacotherapeutic agents for treating acute and chronic PTSD. However, SSRIs largely have several disadvantages which limit their utility. Our previous study has also shown that administration of the total flavonoids, isolated from the extract of Xiaobuxin-Tang (XBXT, mild mind-easing decoction), comprising four Chinese medicines including Haematitum, Flos Inulae, Folium Phyllostachydis Henonis, and Semen Sojae Preparatum, exerted significant antidepressant-like effect in chronically mildly stressed rats, possibly mediated by serotonergic activation. Since the central serotonergic dysfunction is an important and well-known cause mediating the pathophysiology of trauma-related symptoms in PTSD, it is reasonable to predict that flavonoids may exert therapeutic effects on PTSD in animal models. Therefore, the present study aims to examine the effect of flavonoids in alleviating the enhanced anxiety and fear response induced in two PTSD animal models. Ser, an SSRI, was administered as a positive control. Furthermore, the changes of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitters after chronic flavonoids administration have also been assessed in SPS-treated rats.",

        "abstract": "With power networks undergoing an unprecedented transition from traditional power systems to modern electric grids integrated with renewable energy sources, maintaining frequency stability of generators in modern power systems has become one of the major concerns. Targeting this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel frequency restoration strategy in photovoltaics (PV)-connected power systems using decentralized dynamic state estimation technique and PV power plant as a contingency power source. When a sudden increase in load demand occurs, the output power of PV panels is increased in order to compensate for the shortage of real power capacity of the generator, in order to restore the frequency of a certain generator bus bar. An unscented Kalman filter-based decentralized dynamic estimation is utilized in this study to estimate the frequency of a selected generator bus bar with local noisy voltage and current measurement data acquired by using phasor measurement units. Solar luminous intensity may vary over a period of time in different seasons, weather conditions, etc., which causes the variations in the output power of PV power plants. This irradiance uncertainty is also considered in this study. The proposed control strategy not only incorporates the frequency deviations of a generator bus-bar, but also takes into account the tie-line power deviations under disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the capacity of proposed control schemes in restoring the frequency of generator bus-bars and also maintaining the tie-line power flowing between adjoining areas at it scheduled value.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel high-efficiency generation technique for photovoltaic (PV) system, named maximum power point capturing (MPPC) technique. This is an aperiodic perturbation MPPC technique compared to the conventional periodic perturbation maximum power point tracking technique. Firstly, under a closed-loop circuit and an open-loop circuit, the complete I\u2013V curves and P\u2013V curves are defined. Secondly, the proposed MPPC technique is based on the complete I\u2013V curves and a practical model of solar PV systems. The proposed method realizes that maximum power point (MPP) is captured online, and its control strategy is designed to set a steady operating area around MPP. The duty cycle keeps constant when the operating point is within the steady operating area, i.e., aperiodic perturbation, and when the operating point is outside the steady operating area, MPPC is triggered to capture a new MPP with an updated steady operating area. Simulation results demonstrate that no oscillations exist in steady-state; dynamic performances are improved; and only two perturbations are required to capture the new MPP. Using the proposed MPPC method, low voltage ride through and high voltage ride through can be prevented.",

The trimetallic Cu Zn Co catalysts were more active than the bimetallic or monometallic catalysts, showing higher capability to suppress the side reactions and higher resistivity towards the coke formation. The superior activity of Cu Zn Co catalyst was due to the synergistic effects between the three metal species. Cu, Zn, and Co species, which played quite different roles in steam reforming of acetic acid. Cu was the important species to suppress the formation of CO, possibly  \u200bvia  the water gas shift reaction. Co was the main active species for the reforming of the organics including acetic acid and the reaction intermediates such as acetone and methane, which determined the overall activity of the catalyst.

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper studied the effects of the additives including Zr, Mg and K on the catalytic behaviors of Co/Al 2 O 3  during the steam reforming of acetic acid. It was found that Zr additive had negligible effect on the performance of the cobalt catalyst, while Mg additive could markedly lower the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. In comparison, K showed remarkable positive effects on the cobalt catalyst. The additives affect the physiochemical properties of the catalyst in varied ways, imposing distinct effects on the performance of the catalysts. Zr additive did not affect reduction behaviors of cobalt oxides or distribution of metallic cobalt sites, thus the effects of Zr additive on performances of the catalyst was insignificant. Mg additive, in converse, led to reduction temperature of cobalt oxides shifting upwards, which negatively affected the formation of metallic cobalt sites on surface of the catalyst and consequently on the catalytic activity and stability. K additive could drastically promote the reduction of cobalt oxides, significantly promoting the catalytic activity and stability. Further to this, K additive could also effectively reduce methane formation during steam reforming of acetic acid through suppressing the methanation reactions. In addition, K additive could enhance the resistance of metallic cobalt towards oxidation, enhancing the catalytic stability, while Zr or Mg additive did not have such an effect.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study investigated the interaction of nickel species with alumina versus calcination temperature and nickel loading. A total of 22 Ni/Al 2 O 3  catalysts, calcined at the temperature from 500 to 1000\u202f\u00b0C at a 50\u202f\u00b0C increment, were employed for the study. High calcination temperature led to the formation of nickel\u2013alumina spinel via the solid phase reaction, which shifted the reduction temperature to higher ranges. The catalyst, however, still achieved good activity after full reduction of the nickel\u2013alumina spinel. Nevertheless, the high calcination temperature led to the collapse of the small pores and the formation of the big one, resulting in the significant decrease of specific surface area. At higher nickel loadings, more nickel species weakly interacted with alumina formed as the reactive center of alumina was saturated. With the increase of nickel loading, the catalytic activities were not varied much but the catalytic stability and the resistivity towards coking enhanced. The coke produced over the catalyst at low nickel loading tended to be amorphous, while the coke produced at the high nickel loading was more fibrous. Furthermore, the coke produced at the low loading contained more small aromatic rings and more oxygen-containing functional groups. The higher nickel loading possibly promoted the catalytic cracking reactions to form more catalytic coke while the low nickel loading probably favored the polymerization reactions to form the polymeric coke. In addition, the calcination at the higher temperature could enhance the stability of the catalysts, which might be related to the enlarged pore sizes.",

Investigation of reaction characteristics of carboxylic acids during steam reforming contributes to understanding of the reaction behaviors of bio-oil in reforming process. Acetic acid is a major carboxylic acid in bio-oil. The research activities on acetic acid steam reforming have been intensified in recent years. A number of reforming catalysts, reforming processes and reactors have been developed. The catalysts developed differentiate from each other in terms of activity, stability and resistivity towards coking, due to their distinct elemental compositions, structural configurations and surface properties. The reforming processes and the reactors used for steam reforming of acetic acid also varies substantially, imposing profound effects on the reforming of acetic acid. To assess state of the art of the catalysts/process/reactors develop for acetic acid steam reforming, a critical review is required to screen the intrinsic effects of these variables. This review focuses on the progress of steam reforming of acetic acid in three aspects: reforming processes, reactors and catalysts. The information from this review will be a useful reference for the research in steam reforming of bio-oil and other organics such as methanol, ethanol and acetone.",

Understanding their reaction behaviours during hydrogenation helps to clarify the reaction network during hydrotreatment of bio-oil. This study investigated the hydrogenation of typical phenolic compounds in bio-oil in water, which is an important fraction of bio-oil, and in methanol, which is used to esterify bio-oil. The results indicated that hydrogenation of the phenolics is more efficient in water than in methanol. With water medium, both the unsaturated oxygen-containing functionalities and the benzene ring of the phenolics can be effectively hydrogenated. In comparison, with methanol medium, only the unsaturated oxygen-containing functionality can be hydrogenated, while the hydrogenation of the benzene ring is rather difficult. Stereoselectivity was also observed in the hydrogenation of phenolics with three or more hydroxyl groups/methoxyl groups. For phenolics with two hydroxyl groups/methoxyl groups, the hydrogenation produces both cis- and trans-configurations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, methanation of CO 2  over Ni/Al 2 O 3  with varied nickel loading (from 0 to 50\u00a0wt%) was evaluated, striving to explore the effects of nickel loading on catalytic behaviors and the reaction intermediates formed. The results showed that agglomeration of nickel particles were closely related to interaction between nickel and alumina. Increasing nickel loading resulted in the increased proportion of nickel having medium strong interaction with alumina, the reduced reduction degree of NiO, the increase of medium to strong basic sites, the enhanced activity for methanation and the competition between reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and methanation. Lower nickel loading promoted RWGS reaction while methanation of CO 2  dominated at higher nickel loading. The catalyst with a nickel loading around 25% achieved the best activity for methanation. The in\u2013situ DRIFTS studies of methanation of CO 2  showed that CO 2  could be absorbed on surface of metallic Ni, NiO or alumina. More metallic nickel species on alumina suppressed formation of carbonate species while promoted further conversion of HCOO \u2217  species and  \u2217 CH 3  species, achieving a higher catalytic efficiency. Moreover, more metallic nickel species was crucial for gasifying the carbonaceous intermediates, prevented aggregation of the intermediates to coke and achieving a higher catalytic stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, steam reforming of guaiacol over Ni/Al 2 O 3  and Ni/SBA\u201315 catalysts were evaluated, aiming to investigate the impacts of the two supports with varied pore sizes, level of interaction with nickel species on behaviors of the catalyst and properties of the coke formed. The results indicated steam reforming of guaiacol involved a complex reaction network as isomerization and cracking of guaiacol produced many by-products like furans, cyclopentones and heavier aromatics. Ni/SBA\u201315 and Ni/Al 2 O 3  catalyst only showed appreciable activities for guaiacol reforming at 600\u202f\u00b0C. Although nickel size was bigger in Ni/SBA\u201315, Ni/SBA\u201315 showed superior activity to that of the Ni/Al 2 O 3 . In situ DRIFTS studies of guaiacol reforming indicated that the strong absorption of the phenolics on Ni/Al 2 O 3  catalyst might lead to the coverage of the active sites and the low catalytic activity. Although coking was more serious over Ni/SBA\u201315, Ni/SBA\u201315 was much more stable than Ni/Al 2 O 3 . The TG\u2013MS, Raman, FT-IR, elemental analysis, and TEM characterizations indicated the coke over Ni/Al 2 O 3  catalyst was mainly aliphatic, thermally unstable and existed in an amorphous form, while the coke over Ni/SBA\u201315 catalyst was mainly aromatic, thermally stable and existed in the form of carbon nanotubes.",

The effects of the indentation size and loading rate on creep behavior were investigated. The experimental results show that the hardness, creep depth, creep strain rate, and stress exponent are all dependent on the holding load and loading rate. The creep behavior shows a remarkable indentation size effect at different maximum indentation loads. The dominant creep mechanism is dislocation creep at high indentation loads and self-diffusion at low indentation loads. An obvious loading rate sensitivity of creep behavior is found under different loading rates for the alloy. A high loading rate can lead to a high strain gradient, and numerous dislocations emerge and entangle together. Then during the holding time, a large creep deformation characteristic with a high stress exponent will happen.",

The body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, face-centered cubic (FCC) phase, and Laves phase were found in the alloy system. With an increase in the Ti content and a decrease in the Al content, the structure changes of the alloys from BCC to BCC + FCC to BCC + FCC + Laves, and then to Laves + FCC phases. The FCC phase is located at the BCC grain boundary. The CoFeNiMnTi 0.5 Al 0.5  HEA with a BCC + FCC duplex phase structure shows the optimal performance of both strength and ductility. The yield strength, fracture strength, and fracture strain can reach 1052.8\u202fMPa, 2402.4\u202fMPa, and 20.5%, respectively. The hardness reaches HV518.7. Nanoindentation experiments show that the BCC phase is harder than the FCC phase in the CoFeNiMnTi 0.5 Al 0.5  HEA. Furthermore, the deformation behaviors of the FCC phase and BCC phase are studied by measuring the first pop-in behavior.",

Both the CoFeMnNi and CoFeMnNiTi 0.25  alloys exhibit a simple face-centered cubic (FCC) solid-solution structure, whereas the CoFeMnNiTi 0.5  and CoFeMnNiTi 0.75  alloys exhibit a dual-phase structure consisting of a FCC solid-solution and a Laves phase. The Laves phase is identified as a Fe 2 Ti type and has a hexagonal C14 structure. The volume fraction of the Laves phase increases with increasing the Ti content. The Ti content has an obvious effect on the mechanical properties of the alloys. The yield strength and hardness of the alloys improve but ductility simultaneously decreases as the Ti content increases. The CoFeMnNiTi 0.5  alloy has a good balance of both strength and ductility, and is superior to other similar CoCrFeNi-based and CoCrCuFeNi-based alloys. The yield strength, fracture strength and fracture strain of the CoFeMnNiTi 0.5  alloy can reach 803\u202fMPa, 2300\u202fMPa and 34%, respectively. In addition, nanoindention tests show that the nanohardness value of the Laves phase is almost two times of the FCC phase, and the elastic modulus of the Laves phase is higher than that of the FCC phase in the current alloy system. By measuring the first pop-in event, the deformation behaviors of FCC and the Laves phases of the CoFeMnNiTi 0.5  alloy were investigated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The order-disorder transition has long been viewed as an important key to study materials structures and properties. Especially, pressure-induced ordering attracted the intense research interest in the recent years. In the present work, the pressure-induced ordering phase transition (disordered-fcc to ordered-fcc structures) in a CoCrCuFeNiPr high-entropy alloy (HEA) was found by employing the  in situ  high-pressure energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) technique. It is interesting to note that there exists a pressure-induced fast ordering transition at the pressure ranging from 7.8\u202fGPa to 16.0\u202fGPa, followed by a slow transition with the pressure increase up to 106.4\u202fGPa. We suggest that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of some short-range-order (SRO) local structures in the CoCrCuFeNiPr HEA. These SRO structures can be regarded as embryos, which will develop into the ordered phase with increasing the pressure in the prototype materials. This pressure-induced ordering may provides a new technique for tuning structures and properties of HEAs.",

We examined the microstructure and reverse transformation of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase and its influence on the properties of the HEA after compression. The hcp laths with a width of several nanometer formed after compressed at room temperature, and kept the Kurdjumov-Sachs oriental relationship with the face-center-cubic (fcc) phase. During annealing, partial hcp laths transformed reversely into the fcc-structured nano twins. The influence of the hcp phase on the hardness of the HEA was discussed.

The crystal structure changed from a sole face-centered-cubic (FCC) structure to a dual-phase structure of FCC plus body-centered-cubic (BCC) structure with the increasing of Cr content. By controlling the addition of Al and Cr elements, the crystalline structure changed to a BCC structure, which was composed of two ordered BCC phase. One is (Al, Ni)-enriched, and the other is (Co, Fe, Cr)-enriched. The increment of the BCC/B2 phase could significantly enhance the hardness and yield strength with a slight sacrifice to ductility. The nanoindentation tests showed that with the increasing of the Al and Cr content, the nano-hardness increased from 4.58\u202fGPa to 8.95\u202fGPa, and the elastic modulus increased from 200.83\u202fGPa to 233.76\u202fGPa, respectively. Based on the nanoindentation results, the H/E r  and H 3 /E r  2  values were calculated, which could be used to estimate the wear resistance. Both the H/E r  ratio and H 3 /E r  2  ratio showed an increase trend with the addition of Cr and Al elements, which demonstrated that the anti-wear ability was enhanced. The compression tests indicated that the (CoCrFeNi) 4 Cr 1 Al 1  alloy demonstrated excellent comprehensive compression properties, whose yield strength and fracture strain is 1653\u202fMPa and 29.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the strengthening mechanism has been discussed. In comparison with the solid solution strengthening, the second phase strengthening is dominant.",

To strengthen this material, the (Al 7 Co 24 Cr 21 Fe 24 Ni 24 ) 100- x  Cr  x   ( x \u202f=\u202f0, 11, 20, and 26) high entropy alloys were prepared and investigated. We found that with increasing the Cr content, the volume fraction of the BCC phase enriched with Al, Fe, and Cr elements increased gradually. In the BCC-contained HEAs, ordered B2 particles were always dispersed in the BCC solid solution, which resulted in a dramatic enhancement of comprehensive mechanical properties. Nanoindentation measurements showed that both the nanohardness and the elastic modulus values of the BCC phase are much greater than that of the FCC phase. The room-temperature compression test showed that the yield strength significantly increased from 249\u202fMPa to 1649\u202fMPa with the slight sacrifice of the ductility, along with increasing the Cr content. More importantly, the (Al 7 Co 24 Cr 21 Fe 24 Ni 24 ) 74 Cr 26  alloy exhibits outstanding compression behavior, with the high yield strength (1649\u202fMPa) and fracture strength (2830\u202fMPa) as well as good compressive plastic strain of 24.9%.

As a result, one can obtain all possible bounded exact traveling wave solutions including soliatry waves, kink and periodic wave solutions of many nonlinear wave equations by the formulas presented in this paper.

By reducing this high-order wave equation into two associated solvable ordinary differential equations, we derive the two-wave solutions in the form (u(x,t)=U(x-c_1t)+V(x-c_2t)) which includes solitary wave solutions, periodic solutions and quasi-periodic wave solutions by letting (c_1=c_2). We obtain a family of new exact two-wave solutions combined by a solitary wave and a periodic wave with two different wave speeds. These new exact two-wave solutions are neither periodic nor quasi-periodic wave solutions but approximating periodic wave solutions as time tends to infinity. The process of translation of the two-wave solution combined by two solitary wave solutions is illustrated by simulation. The approach presented in this work might be applied to study the bifurcation of multi-wave solutions of some important high-order nonlinear wave model equations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, the bounded traveling wave solutions of the modified water wave equations of which one dependent variable attains the singular value    2  c    in finite or infinite time are investigated by using the bifurcation theory of planar dynamical systems. The line    V  =  2  c    is the so-called singular line of the associated dynamical system and the results of this paper show that the solutions possess singularity if and only if their corresponding phase orbits intersect with this singular line. There are two types of solutions corresponding to these orbits intersecting with the singular line: smooth classical solutions and compact solutions possessing compact support in      H    l  o  c    1     (  R  )    , which suggests that the existence of singular line breaks the uniqueness of solutions in      H    l  o  c    1     (  R  )     space. There is a significant discovery from the investigation of the modified water wave equations that there are new type of solitary wave solutions approaching the singular value    2  c    as time tends to infinite that correspond to some specific orbits connecting with singular lines of the associated traveling wave system, which refreshes and enriches the knowledge of the effects of singular lines on the traveling wave solutions to nonlinear wave equations. The explicit bounded smooth traveling wave solutions and compact solutions of the modified water wave equations are presented and simulated numerically.",

However, the growing proportion of flexible loads has made the reliability of smart grids different from that of traditional power systems.

Load curtailment and shifting have been considered in the developed Markov model for flexible loads. Moreover, time-sequential simulation procedures of reliability evaluation for distribution systems considering flexible loads have been developed.

        "abstract": "The energy storage system can effectively reduce the volatility caused by more and more renewable energy sources in the power grid, improve the utilization rate of renewable energy and the stability of system. In this paper, the optimized operation mode and capacity configuration method of pumped storage station in a renewable energy grid are studied by taking the practical energy storage facility as an example. The pumped storage station is operated under its capacity constraints, and it is divided into the energy storage condition and the power generation condition by positive or negative of the unbalanced power in the grid. On this basis, this paper puts forward the way of the pumped storage station participating in the power grid generation plan: Pumped storage station does not participate in the actual day-ahead power generation plan only plays a reserve role, in the real-time generation plan, the pumped storage station is preferentially called to equilibrium the deviation between day-ahead forecast value and real-time forecast value of equivalent load. The mathematical model of this method and the optimization method are also given. In addition, the capacity of pumped storage station is planned and designed by the method of probability statistics. Finally, through the analysis of the simple system with four elements and single busbar, the feasibility of the optimized operation mode is verified, and the sensitivity of the capacity of the pumped storage station is discussed qualitatively based on the operating cost of the conventional power grid.",

        "abstract": "With the ever-intensive utilization of distributed generators (DGs) and smart devices, distribution networks are evolving from a hierarchal structure to a distributed structure, which imposes significant challenges to network operators in system dispatch. A distributed energy-management method for a networked microgrid (NM) is proposed to coordinate a large number of DGs for maintaining secure and economic operations in the electricity-market environment. A second-order conic programming model is used to formulate the energy-management problem of an NM. Network decomposition was first carried out, and then a distributed solution for the established optimization model through invoking alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A modified IEEE 33-bus power system was finally utilized to demonstrate the performance of distributed energy management in an NM.",

In particular, the microgrid operator (MGO) determines the optimal energy management scheme while the CBs enjoy a dynamic pricing tariff to adjust their consumption patterns for cost saving. The interactions between MGO and CBs are formulated as a bi-level optimisation problem where the MGO behaves as a leader and CBs act as followers. The proposed model is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem by jointly using the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) condition and the strong duality theory. Besides, the effects of correlated solar irradiance and solar illuminance uncertainties on the load profile are taken into account through invoking the Nataf transformation-based 2\n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><italic>M</italic>\u2009</bold>\n+\u20091 point estimate method (PEM).

        "abstract": "A series of the anionic heterobimetallic rare-earth metal complexes supported by trans- or chiral pyrrolyl-substituted 1,2-diimino ligands were synthesized in good yields via reactions of [(MeSi)N]RE(\u03bc-Cl)Li(THF) with the corresponding 1,2-diimino proligands. Reactions of [(MeSi)N]RE(\u03bc-Cl)Li(THF) with 2 equiv of trans-1,2-bis(pyrrol-2-ylmethylene)-1,2-diphenylethanediamine (HL) afforded the discrete ion-pair rare-earth metal complexes [Li(THF)][(L)RE] (RE = Sm(5), Dy(6), Er(7)). Reactions of [(MeSi)N]RE(\u03bc-Cl)Li(THF) with 2 equiv of ( R, R)-1,2-bis(pyrrol-2-ylmethylene)-1,2-diphenylethanediamine (HL) gave the heterobimetallic rare-earth metal complexes (L)RELi(THF) (RE = Sm(8), Y(9)). When the rare-earth metal is Er, the chiral linear rare-earth coordination polymer {(L)ErLi}  (10) was obtained. Reactions of [(MeSi)N]RE(\u03bc-Cl)Li(THF) with 2 equiv of trans-1,2-bis(pyrrol-2-ylmethyleneamino)cyclohexane (HL) gave the heterobimetallic rare-earth metal complexes (L)RELi(THF) (RE = Pr (11), Sm(12), Eu(13)). Reactions of [(MeSi)N]RE(\u03bc-Cl)Li(THF) with 2 equiv of ( R, R)-1,2-bis(pyrrol-2-ylmethyleneamino)cyclohexane (HL) also gave the heterobimetallic rare-earth metal complexes (L)RELi(THF) (Ln = Pr(14), Sm(15)). All complexes were characterized by spectroscopic methods and elemental analyses, and complexes 5-11, 13, and 14 were further determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The catalytic properties of racemic rare-earth metal complexes on cyanosilylation of ketones were examined, and results showed that the above complexes could effectively catalyze the cyanosilylation of ketones. Chiral rare-earth metal complexes as catalysts for the enantioselective epoxidation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones were also examined to afford the chiral epoxides in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.",

Assuming that information on external disturbances is unknown, a finite time sliding mode (FTSM) control law is developed to handle actuator faults/failures. Under the constraint conditions including the actuator faults and external disturbance, stability analysis shows that the designed controller not only ensures the attitude tracking convergence in finite time, but also has superior to actuator fault tolerance. Finally, in order to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed control law, the numerical simulations are carried out for spacecraft under actuator faults and disturbances.",

First, differential flatness (DF) approach is applied to the dynamic equations of the entry vehicle to represent the state variables more conveniently. Then, the presented SMC law can guarantee the property of finite-time convergence of tracking error, which requires no information on high uncertainties that are estimated by ESO, and the rigorous proof of tracking error convergence is given. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, a novel compound control method consisting of adaptive finite-time sliding mode control (AFTSMC) law and final position guidance (FPG) is proposed to achieve high-precision guidance for Mars entry. In the first stage of entry, by employing adaptive law and extended state observer (ESO), an AFTSMC law is designed to avoid the overestimating control gains and then eliminate the chattering effectively. Furthermore, the proposed AFTSMC law not only provides strong robustness against uncertainties but also achieves finite-time convergence of tracking error. In the second stage, a new FPG is used to accurately deliver the vehicle to the required target in three-dimensional space. Therefore, the compound controller combines the advantages of AFTSMC law and FPG method, and numerical simulation results show that the proposed compound controller can not only provide favorable control performance but also improve the entry guidance precision under large uncertainties.",

In the low speed region, a high-frequency signal is injected, which is independent of the motor parameters. The rotor speed is identified by extracting the high frequency current. In the higher speed region, the rotor speed is obtained through full order flux observer to prevent the high-frequency torque ripple caused by HFSIM. An appropriate state switcher is proposed, in order to ensure smooth transition as the speed rises, as well as to ensure the accurate estimation of the rotor flux orientation angle within the whole speed range. The overall control strategy can output constant torque and satisfy heavily loaded condition. The experimental motor control test proves the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

The rectifier load as one of typical nonlinear load is taken as the research object in this paper. The output waveform optimization in harmonic suppression is the target. Firstly the double closed-loop control scheme is used to control the inverter and harmonics caused by the rectifier loads is analyzed. Then instantaneous reactive power theory is adopted to detect the harmonics. Finally adaptive proportional resonant controller is used to complete harmonic suppression and parameter adaptive adjustment. A simulation model of inverter system is established to analyze the harmonic content of the system under different control schemes. The output voltage harmonic content is reduced from 6.52% to 2.26% in the actual system, effectively improves the inverter output waveform quality. The result verifies the validity of proposed adaptive resonant controller.",

Double closed-loop control algorithm based on current decoupling is used for the four-quadrant rectifier. Double closed-loop control algorithm based on voltage and current decoupling is used for the three-phase voltage inverter. In order to suppress the large amount of output voltage harmonics due to the auxiliary rectifier applied as load, a repetitive control loop is added to the instantaneous voltage loop. In addition, a novel short-circuit current limiting control algorithm is designed for the three-phase inverter. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by simulation and experimental results of a 220kVA APU. The single-phase input power factor closely achieves one when fully loaded. The output voltage THD reduces significantly under rectifier load. APU could limit the short-circuit current properly, and quickly restore the rated output without protection action when short-circuit is removed.",

Therefore, we investigated the effect of C. pneumoniae infection on angiogenesis, and then explored the roles of IQGAP1-related signaling in C. pneumoniae infection-induced angiogenesis. C. pneumoniae infection significantly enhanced angiogenesis as assessed by the tube formation assay possibly by inducing vascular endothelial cell (VEC) migration in the wound healing and Transwell migration assays. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation, Western blot and tube formation assay results showed that the phosphorylation of both IQGAP1 and N-WASP was required for the angiogenesis induced by C. pneumoniae infection. Our co-immunoprecipitation study revealed that IQGAP1 physically associated with N-WASP after C. pneumoniae infection of VECs. Actin polymerization assay further showed that in C. pneumoniae-infected VECs, both IQGAP1 and N-WASP were recruited to filamentous actin, and shared some common compartments localized at the leading edge of lamellipodia, which was impaired after the depletion of IQGAP1 by using the small interference RNA. Moreover, the knockdown of IQGAP1 also significantly decreased N-WASP phosphorylation at Tyr256 induced by C. pneumoniae infection. We conclude that C. pneumoniae infection promotes VEC migration and angiogenesis presumably through the IQGAP1-related signaling pathway.",

Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection has been shown to promote monocyte transendothelial migration (TEM). However, the exact mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that C. pneumoniae infection increases vascular endothelial cell (VEC) permeability and subsequent monocyte TEM through stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin). Here, we demonstrated that C. pneumoniae infection promoted monocyte TEM in a TEM assay possibly by increasing the permeability of a VEC line EA.hy926\u202fcell as assessed by measuring the passage of FITC-BSA across a VEC monolayer. Subsequently, Western blot analysis showed that C. pneumoniae infection induced VE-cadherin internalization. Our further data revealed that Src-mediated VE-cadherin phosphorylation at Tyr658 was involved in C. pneumoniae infection-induced internalization of VE-cadherin, VEC hyperpermeability and monocyte TEM.

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with gate electrodes modified with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) films were fabricated and successfully used as highly selective and sensitive chiral recognition biosensors for d/l-tryptophan (d/l-Trp) and d/l-tyrosine (d/l-Tyr). The MIP films, which can specifically recognize and has an electrocatalytic effect on the oxidation of Trp and Tyr, together with the amplification function of an OECT, provide a highly sensitive and selective OECT biosensor. The sensor showed a linear response range for l-Trp and L-Tyr from 300\u202fnM to 10\u202f\u03bcM with a sensitivity of 3.19 and 3.64 \u03bcA/\u03bcM, respectivity. And the detection limit for L-Trp and L-Tyr is of 2\u202fnM and 30\u202fnM (S/N > 3). The selectivity factors of L-Trp, D-Trp, L-Tyr and D-Tyr to their enantiomers are 11.6, 3.5, 14.5 and 2.6, respectively. This method can pave the way for widespread applications of OECT-based sensors in chiral material identification.",

The combination of the amplification function of an OECT and the selective specificity of MIPs afforded a highly sensitive, selective OECT sensor. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out to monitor the stepwise fabrication of the modified electrodes and the adsorption capacity of the MIP/Au electrodes. Atomic force microscopy was employed for examining the surface morphology of the electrodes. Important detection parameters, pH and detection temperature were optimized. With the change in the relative concentration of AA from 1\u03bcM to 100\u03bcM, the MIP-OECT sensor exhibited a low detection limit of 10nM (S/N > 3) and a sensitivity of 75.3\u03bcA channel current change per decade under optimal conditions. In addition, the MIP-OECT sensor exhibited excellent specific recognition ability to AA, which prevented the interference from other structurally similar compounds (e.g., aspartic acid, glucose, uric acid, glycine, glutathione, HO), and common metal ions (K, Na, Ca, Mg, and Fe). In addition, a series of vitamin C beverages were analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of the MIP-OECT sensor. Using the proposed principle, several other sensors with improved performance can be constructed via the modification of organic electrochemical transistors with appropriate MIP films.",

The device performance was optimized by functionalizing the gate electrodes of the OECTs with nanocomposites of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and multiple carbon nanomaterials. The detection limit of the optimized OECT sensor was identified to be as low as 10\u00a0nM of GA. We also demonstrated that the optimized OECT sensor worked with a high recovery for rapid and accurate assessment of total phenol content of practical tea samples. Since the OECT is based on the oxidation-reduction reaction at the gate electrode of target analytes, we believe our low-cost and easy-fabricating OECT-based sensor offers a promising platform for the development of disposable and portable sensors with high sensitivity for a wide range of practical samples.",

Thus, it is of great significance for the development of highly sensitive and selective strategies for the detection of Cu2+ ions. Here, we report a highly efficient poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) sensor, for real-time Cu2+ ions detection. The detection limit of the OECT device is as low as 100 nM, far beyond the sensitivity required for practical uses. The detection mechanism may base on the chemical reactivity of Cu2+ ions oxiding the PEDOT:PSS in solution both in absence and presence of the base potential. The OECT devices also exhibit excellent selective response to Cu2+ ions rather than other metal ions. Finally, we also demonstrate the determination of Cu2+ ions in tap water with the OECT Cu2+ sensor. Considering the high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as the real-time and low cost features of our Cu2+ OECT sensor, it is ideal for portable and disposable applications for environment monitoring and public health.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    l -Histidine (L-His) is an essential bioactive amino acid, playing a significant role in several biological processes. Therefore, the accurate determination of L-His is of great significance to human health. In this work, a strategy was developed for the chiral detection of L-His using an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) sensor based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). MIP films were electrodeposited on OECT gate platforms. MIP films designed for specifically recognizing His combined with the amplified function of an OECT yielded highly sensitive and selective OECT biosensor. The properties of the resulting biosensor were characterized by various analytical methods. The results indicated that changes in channel current was proportional to D-His and L-His concentrations from 100\u202fnM to 10\u202f\u03bcM, with the detection limits of 10\u202fnM and 100\u202fnM\u202f(S/N\u202fu003e\u202f3), respectively. Furthermore, the highly selective MIP film allowed to differentiate L-His from D-His or D-His from L-His. In terms of selectivity, the tests suggested apparent differences in channel current changes between L-His and D-His and interferences. The applicability of the biosensor for L-His detection in human urine demonstrated this sensor will be ideal transducers for disposable applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "The oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is an important pest of most stone and pome fruits and causes serious damage to the fruit industry worldwide. This insect pest has been primarily controlled through the application of insecticides; as a result, G. molesta has developed resistance to many different types of insecticides. To identify detoxification genes, we have, de novo, sequenced the transcriptome of G. molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and yielded 58,970 unigenes of which 26,985 unigenes matched to known proteins. In total, 2,040 simple sequence repeats have been identified. The comprehensive transcriptome data set has permitted us to identify members of important gene families related to detoxification in G. molesta, including 77 unigenes of putative cytochrome P450s, 28 of glutathione S-transferases, 46 of Carboxylesterases, and 31 of insecticide targets. Orthologs of some of these unigenes have shown to play a pivotal role in insecticide resistance in other insect species and those unigenes likely have similar functions in G. molesta.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer, 1776) can cause significant economic losses in different crops in China. In the present study, we evaluated wing shape and size variation among biotypes from tobacco, Nicotiana spp. (Solanaceae), cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. (Brassicaceae), and peach, Prunus persica (L.) Batsch (Rosaceae), and tested whether specimens could be distinguished at the population level. Fifteen landmarks were measured on the wings and used to generate geometric morphometric size and shape data from 137 specimens of M. persicae from three host plants: tobacco, cabbage and peach. Analysis of wing size showed that the peach biotype had the smallest wing centroid size. A one-way ANOVA of centroid size showed significant inter- and intra-populational differences. A Tukey post-hoc test revealed that the wing centroid size of the peach population was significantly smaller than that of either the tobacco or cabbage population.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this study, odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory protein (CSP), which are associated with the sensitivity of  Grapholita molesta , were comprehensively analysed using bioinformatics. The full-length cDNAs of GmolOBP1, GmolOBP2, and GmolCSP were downloaded and their open reading frames (ORFs) were analysed. Their physicochemical properties were determined and their structures and functions were predicted. Additionally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate the evolutionary relationships among GmolOBP1, GmolOBP2, GmolCSP, and 14 other insect proteins. GmolOBP1, GmolOBP2 and GmolCSP were composed of 164, 161, and 127 amino acids. GmolOBP1 and GmolOBP2 contained 7 and 6 cysteine residues forming 3 disulphide bonds. The transmembrane, hydrophobic, and signal peptide regions overlapped in GmolOBP1 and GmolCSP and were located in the extracellular environment. GmolCSP showed more coiled coils and a smaller cavity in the three-dimensional structure than GmolOBP1 and GmolOBP2. In the phylogenetic tree, GmolOBP1, GmolOBP2, and GmolCSP were in different clusters or sub-clusters. In conclusion, GmolOBP1 and GmolOBP2 shared some common properties with other OBPs. Additionally, GmolOBP1, GmolOBP2, and GmolCSP may have evolved independently.",

Fortunately, by using fluorene derivatives and cuprous ions, a novel MOF (Cu-P6) has been synthesized for blue electrophosphorescence. The topological structure of Cu-P6 displays a 3-connected uninodal net with a cross-stacking pattern. Such a structure allowed phosphorescent Cu-P6 to exhibit a good heat resistance and luminous efficiency (\u03a6 = 0.62) at crystalline state. By containing both donor and acceptor in the structure, Cu-P6 possesses a balanced electron and hole mobility. Especially, electrical-driven deep-blue emission of a MOF was reported for the first time. Overall, this work may open new perspectives on developing highly efficient electrophosphorescent devices based on MOFs. The utilization of earth-abundant cuprous ions is another attractive feature of Cu-P6.",

Various types of mechanical stimuli promote osteogenesis and increase bone formation elicit increases in intracellular-free calcium concentration in osteoblasts. However, whether microgravity, a condition of mechanical unloading, exerts an influence on intracellular-free calcium concentration in osteoblasts or what mechanisms may underlie such an effect are unclear. Herein, we show that simulated microgravity reduces intracellular-free calcium concentration in primary mouse osteoblasts. In addition, simulated microgravity substantially suppresses the activities of L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which selectively allow calcium to cross the plasma membrane from the extracellular space. Moreover, the functional expression of ryanodine receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, which mediate the release of calcium from intracellular storage, decreased under simulated microgravity conditions. These results suggest that simulated microgravity substantially reduces intracellular-free calcium concentration through inhibition of calcium channels in primary mouse osteoblasts. Our study may provide a novel mechanism for microgravity-induced detrimental effects in osteoblasts, offering a new avenue to further investigate bone loss induced by mechanical unloading.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have confirmed that microRNAs and lncRNAs can affect bone cell differentiation and bone formation. In this study, miR-139-3p was upregulated in the femurs of hindlimb unloading mice and MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity; this effect was related to osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis. Silencing miR-139-3p attenuated the suppression of differentiation and the promotion of MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis induced by simulated microgravity. ELK1 is a target of miR-139-3p and is essential for miR-139-3p to regulate osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis. An osteoblast differentiation-related lncRNA that could interact with miR-139-3p (lncRNA ODSM) was identified in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity. Further investigations demonstrated that lncRNA ODSM could promote MC3T3-E1 cell differentiation. Therefore, this research was the first to reveal the critical role of the lncRNA ODSM/miR-139-3p/ELK1 pathway in osteoblasts, and these findings suggest the potential value of miR-139-3p in osteoporosis diagnosis and therapy.",

Herein, we confirmed that simulated microgravity inhibits osteoblast proliferation. Then, we investigated the effect of mechanical unloading on the osteoblast cell cycle and found that simulated microgravity arrested the osteoblast cell cycle in the G phase. In addition, our data showed that cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts from simulated microgravity was mainly because of decreased cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, miR-181c-5p directly inhibited cyclin B1 protein translation by binding to a target site in the 3'UTR. Lastly, we demonstrated that inhibition of miR-181c-5p partially counteracted cell cycle arrest and decreased the osteoblast proliferation induced by simulated microgravity. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in the G phase in primary mouse osteoblasts partially through the miR-181c-5p/cyclin B1 pathway. This work may provide a novel mechanism of microgravity-induced detrimental effects on osteoblasts and offer a new avenue to further investigate bone loss induced by mechanical unloading.",

        "abstract": "Abstract T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Recent studies have indicated that the TNFSF15 gene that encodes the TL1A protein can regulate the differentiation and activation of T cells. TNFSF15 gene polymorphisms have been found to be associated with several autoimmune disorders. A possible association of TNFSF15 with acute anterior uveitis (AAU) has not yet been reported and was therefore the purpose of our study. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 983 AAU patients and 1128 healthy controls. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies were compared using \u03c72 analysis between AAU patients and healthy controls. Stratified analysis was also performed according to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) status. The TNFSF15 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR. A significantly decreased frequency of the TT genotype in TNFSF15-rs3810936 was found in AAU patients (P = 6.36 \u00d7 10(-6), corrected P[Pc] = 1.52 \u00d7 10(-4), OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.5-0.8). Stratification according to AS status did not reveal a difference concerning the association with TNFSF15-rs3810936. None of the other TNFSF15 SNPs tested were associated with AAU. This study shows an association between TNFSF15-rs3810936 and AAU and suggests that the TL1A/DR3 pathway may be implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

        "abstract": "Background  Although previous genome-wide association studies in various cohorts have identified several susceptibility loci underlying Behcetu0027s disease (BD), this has not yet led to a breakthrough in the management of BD.  Objective  This study aimed to further investigate the association of 26 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms with previous genome-wide association studies\u2013identified nearly positive  P  values (5.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128  P  \u22125 ) in Chinese Han patients with BD.  Methods  A case-control association study was performed in 1206 patients with BD and 2475 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using iPLEX Gold genotyping assay. Gene expression and cytokine production was quantified by real-time PCR and ELISA.  Results  The results showed that significantly higher frequencies of the  IL23R-IL12RB2 /rs924080\u00a0TT genotype ( P \u00a0=\u00a02.03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ; odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.50),  IL23R-IL12RB2 /rs12141431 CC genotype ( P \u00a0=\u00a02.18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ; OR\u00a0=\u00a01.53),  IL10 /rs1800871\u00a0TT genotype ( P \u00a0=\u00a05.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22128 ; OR\u00a0=\u00a01.47), and  IL10 /rs3024490\u00a0TT genotype ( P \u00a0=\u00a02.80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22125 ; OR\u00a0=\u00a01.34) were found in BD. Functional experiments showed an increased  IL23R  expression and IL-17 production in rs12141431/CC genotype carriers compared with GG genotype carriers. A\u00a0decreased  IL10  expression and IL-10 production was observed in rs3024490/TT genotype carriers as compared with GG genotype carriers.  Conclusions  Our findings not only confirmed the association of  IL10 /rs1800871 and  IL23R-IL12RB2 /rs924080 with BD but also identified 2 susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms in  IL10  and  IL23R-IL12RB2  (rs3024490 and rs12141431) with BD in Han Chinese.",

        "abstract": "An inverse source estimation method is proposed to reconstruct emission rates using local air concentration sampling data. It involves the nonlinear least squares-based ensemble four-dimensional variational data assimilation (NLS-4DVar) algorithm and a transfer coefficient matrix (TCM) created using FLEXPART, a Lagrangian atmospheric dispersion model. The method was tested by twin experiments and experiments with actual Cs-137 concentrations measured around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP). Emission rates can be reconstructed sequentially with the progression of a nuclear accident, which is important in the response to a nuclear emergency. With pseudo observations generated continuously, most of the emission rates were estimated accurately, except under conditions when the wind blew off land toward the sea and at extremely slow wind speeds near the FDNPP. Because of the long duration of accidents and variability in meteorological fields, monitoring networks composed of land stations only in a local area are unable to provide enough information to support an emergency response. The errors in the estimation compared to the real observations from the FDNPP nuclear accident stemmed from a shortage of observations, lack of data control, and an inadequate atmospheric dispersion model without improvement and appropriate meteorological data. The proposed method should be developed further to meet the requirements of a nuclear emergency response.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The role of emission rate in atmospheric dispersion modeling was investigated in this study. Six different emission rates that were estimated by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency and Norwegian Institute for Air Research after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident were used as inputs to FLEXPART-WRF, a Lagrangian particle dispersion model. High-resolution (1\u00a0km) meteorological data in a local scale region (100\u00a0km) were downscaled dynamically by the Weather Research and Forecasting model from a reanalysis of ERA-Interim during 11\u201331 March, 2011, and were used to drive the model. The accumulated deposition of  137 Cs was used to assess the simulations. Deposition occurred mainly during four periods dominated by wet deposition due to precipitation, which were 15, 20\u201322, 25, and 30\u201331 March. The basic deposition pattern was established on 15 March, shortly after the highest emission rates of 14 March, and the largest variation in deposition with the different emission rates was also observed in this period. Emission rates estimated are usually not independent from the models and meteorological input data. The model-meteorology combination used for emergency response activities had better be the one used to determine the source term.",

        "abstract": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been reported to be closely associated with the increased lung cancer risk in populations, but the mechanisms underlying PM-associated carcinogenesis are not yet clear. Previous studies have indicated that aberrant epigenetic alterations, such as genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and gene-specific DNA hypermethylation contribute to lung carcinogenesis. And silence or mutation of P53 tumor suppressor gene is the most prevalent oncogenic driver in lung cancer development. To explore the effects of PM2.5 on global and P53 promoter methylation changes and the mechanisms involved, we exposed human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) to low concentrations of PM2.5 for 10 days. Our results indicated that PM2.5-induced global DNA hypomethylation was accompanied by reduced DNMT1 expression. PM2.5 also induced hypermethylation of P53 promoter and inhibited its expression by increasing DNMT3B protein level. Furthermore, ROS-induced activation of Akt was involved in PM2.5-induced increase in DNMT3B. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that repeated exposure to PM2.5 induces epigenetic silencing of P53 through ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway-mediated promoter hypermethylation, which not only provides a possible explanation for PM-induced lung cancer, but also may help to identify specific interventions to prevent PM-induced lung carcinogenesis.

        "abstract": "Worsening air pollution is a serious threat to public health in many urban and heavily industrialized areas. Particle size and chemical composition are well known determinants of the pathological response to air pollution. In addition, pathological responses may depend on the exposure profile (or scenario) of air pollution. For instance, we previously demonstrated that repeated exposure to low levels of fine airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) induced distinct epigenetic changes compared to acute high-doses exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the differential pathological responses of BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells to two distinct PM2.5 exposure scenarios: 24-h exposure to high-doses PM2.5 (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96\u00a0\u03bcg/cm) and 10 days' repeated exposure to low levels of PM2.5 (0, 1.5, 3, 6\u00a0\u03bcg/cm). Acute exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 caused ROS burst, marked DNA damage, dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, autophagy and necrotic cell death. In contrast, repeated low levels of PM2.5 led to sustained low-grade ROS accumulation, milder DNA damage, ER stress/unfolded protein response (UPR), S-phase arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. Notably, most cells surviving repeated low-level exposure showed a series of abnormal adaptive responses, such as inhibition of mitochondria biogenesis and epigenetic dysregulation. These results indicate that different PM2.5 exposure scenarios induce distinct forms cytotoxicity and adaptive response. In addition to particle size and chemical composition, exposure scenario may be a critical factor determining the toxic health effects of PM2.5.",

(2) The pollution index (PI) of Cd and Zn in soil (1.069, 1.584, respectively) suggests that soil is slightly polluted by Cd and Zn. Among all samples, metal contamination levels in soil were all relatively high. (3) A positive correlation was found between the concentrations of Pb, Cd and Cu in vegetables and soil; Pb, Cu, Cr and Ni in vegetables and irrigation water, as well as, Cu and Ni in rice and irrigation water; and, (4) Higher Pb and Cd concentrations were found in student scalp hair in both industrial and suburban areas compared to rural areas.

The aim of the present study was to provide a normative reference of body composition and to investigate age and sex-related differences in healthy subjects by multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA).A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 3451 healthy Chinese adults, 1611 males and 1840 females. The volunteers were enrolled in 5 different age bands (18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 60+). All subjects were measured for weight and height and submitted to BIA, to determine body composition. Body composition measures accounted for differences between men and women.A decrease in fat-free mass and increase in percent body fat was observed with aging, although the phenomenon was proved to be attenuated in women. The central and visceral redistribution of fat mass was also shown along lifetime.This study is a report on body composition of healthy subjects, to be used as an important data for future investigations and differences between nationalities and countries.",

        "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) serve an immunosuppressive role in human tumors. Human Lin human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR) cluster of differentiation (CD)-11bCD33 MDSCs are closely linked with tumor staging, progression, clinical therapeutic efficacy and prognosis for various types of tumors. The present study employed multiparametric flow cytometry to measure the proportion of LinHLA-DRCD11bCD33 MDSCs in the peripheral blood of 105 cervical cancer patients and 50 healthy subjects. The level of MDSC was higher in tumor patients than in the normal control group and this was closely associated with clinical staging. Further analysis of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs was performed in 22 patients. The MDSC proportions in tumor tissue were significantly higher than those in the corresponding adjacent tissue. The phenotypic characteristics of LinHLA-DRCD11bCD33 MDSCs were then evaluated and the results revealed that they express high CD13 and CD39, and low CD115, CD117, CD124 and programmed cell death ligand 1; they were also devoid of CD14, CD15 and CD66b. MDSCs and T-cells from peripheral blood were sorted by flow cytometry for co-culture experiments. LinHLA-DRCD11bCD33 MDSCs from patients significantly inhibited the proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Furthermore, functional analysis verified that MDSCs from cervical cancer patients could inhibit interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3 production from T-cells. In addition, the associations between peripheral circulating MDSCs and tumor infiltrating MDSCs, and tumor relapse and metastasis were analyzed. The number of peripheral MDSCs and MDSCs in tumor tissue were observed to be associated with relapse-free survival. Thus, MDSCs in the peripheral blood and tumors of cervical cancer patients have a significant immunosuppressive effect, and are associated with cervical cancer staging and metastasis. These results suggest that targeting MDSCs may increase antitumor immunity and increase the efficacy of cervical cancer therapies.",

Studies have found that tumor derived exosomes (TEXs) can promote tumor growth and metastasis, as well as inhibit immune response through transferring their genetic information to the recipient cells. Given their functions in tumor progression, TEXs are considered as promising biomarkers for early detection of human malignancy. Dendritic cells (DCs), a type of antigen presenting cells, can induce tumor-specific T cell immune responses in carcinogenesis. Growing evidences have demonstrated that the matured DCs induced by TEXs exhibit enhanced anti-tumor effects that may be applied for cancer immunotherapy. Thus in this review, according to the previous studies, we summarized the effects of DCs loaded with TEXs in cancer immunotherapy.",

Despite their importance, the identification of SVs in cancer genomes remains challenging. Here, we present a framework that integrates optical mapping, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and whole-genome sequencing to systematically detect SVs in a variety of normal or cancer samples and cell lines. We identify the unique strengths of each method and demonstrate that only integrative approaches can comprehensively identify SVs in the genome. By combining Hi-C and optical mapping, we resolve complex SVs and phase multiple SV events to a single haplotype. Furthermore, we observe widespread structural variation events affecting the functions of noncoding sequences, including the deletion of distal regulatory sequences, alteration of DNA replication timing, and the creation of novel three-dimensional chromatin structural domains. Our results indicate that noncoding SVs may be underappreciated mutational drivers in cancer genomes.",

        "abstract": "Structural variants can contribute to oncogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, yet, despite their importance, the identification of structural variants in cancer genomes remains challenging.  Here, we present an integrative framework for comprehensively identifying structural variation in cancer genomes. For the first time, we apply next-generation optical mapping, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) techniques, and whole genome sequencing to systematically detect SVs in a variety of cancer cells. Using this approach, we identify and characterize structural variants in up to 29 commonly used normal and cancer cell lines. We find that each method has unique strengths in identifying different classes of structural variants and at different scales, suggesting that integrative approaches are likely the only way to comprehensively identify structural variants in the genome. Studying the impact of the structural variants in cancer cell lines, we identify widespread structural variation events affecting replication timing and the functions of non-coding sequences in the genome, including the deletion of distal regulatory sequences, alteration of DNA replication timing, and the creation of novel 3D chromatin structural domains.  These results underscore the importance of comprehensive structural variant identification and indicate that non-coding structural variation may be an underappreciated mutational process in cancer genomes.",

In this study, a series of novel derivatives (6-38) between resveratrol and chalcone possessing piperazine moiety have been synthesized, and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW-264.7 macrophages and anti-proliferative effect on a panel of human tumor cell lines (Hela, A549 and SGC7901) by MTT assay were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the substituents of the NH group of piperazine ring had an obvious influence on biological activities. Especially, compounds 13, 17, 30, 31 and 36 showed good inhibitory effect on the generation of NO compared to dexamethasone. Furthermore, analogs 20, 21, 22 and 25 were found to be better anti-proliferative effect on 3 human tumor cell lines, which were found to be better cytotoxic activity to positive control 5-FU. And many compounds displayed low cytotoxic effect on normal cells L02. Further FACs analysis showed that compounds 20 and 25 significantly induced apoptosis in A549 cell. These derivatives were considered as the potential anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The combination of fluorescent (FL) probe and photosensitizer (PS) is a powerful tool for monitoring the changes of specific organelles while studying the photodynamic therapy (PDT) processes at the organelle level. It is very valued for biomedical application but remained challenging due to the lack of ideal FL PDT agent. In this work, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active FL probe (AIE-FR-TPP) by conjugation of a far red/near-infrared (FR/NIR) emitting AIE fluorogen with the mitochondria-targeting group, is reported as a multi-functional fluorophore for mitochondrial imaging and PDT. As for bioimaging, AIE-FR-TPP can selectively light up the cellular mitochondria with low working concentration, short staining time and good biocompatibility. As for PDT, the probe can target mitochondria precisely and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) efficiently both in living cells and zebrafish embryos. Moreover, AIE-FR-TPP is capable of monitoring the morphological changes of mitochondria based on the AIE effect. These results demonstrate that a real-time visual PDT process at the organelle level in living zebrafish embryos is achieved for the first time by using the AIE PS to induce mitochondrial ROS collapse and report the morphological change on site and in time.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are immune suppressive cells, but their roles in tumor growth have been elusive, depending on tumor type or site. Our prior study demonstrated a role of cathepsin S (CatS) in reducing Treg immunosuppressive activity. Therefore, CatS inhibition in Tregs may exacerbate tumor growth. Using mouse bladder carcinoma MB49 cell subcutaneous implant tumor model, we detected no difference in tumor growth, whether mice were given saline- or CatS inhibitor-treated Tregs. However, mice that received inhibitor-treated Tregs had fewer splenic and tumor Tregs, and lower levels of tumor and splenic cell proliferation than mice that received saline-treated Tregs.  In vitro , inhibitor-treated Tregs showed lower proliferation and higher apoptosis than saline-treated Tregs when cells were exposed to MB49. In contrast, both types of Tregs showed no difference in proliferation when they were co-cultured with normal splenocytes. Inhibitor-treated Tregs had less apoptosis in splenocytes, but more apoptosis in splenocytes with MB49 conditioned media than saline-treated Tregs. In turn, we detected less proliferation and more apoptosis of MB94 cells after co-culture with inhibitor-treated Tregs, compared with saline-treated Tregs. B220 +  B-cell, CD4 +  T-cell, and CD8 +  T-cell proliferation and apoptosis were also lower in splenocytes co-cultured with inhibitor-treated Tregs than with saline-treated Tregs. Under the same conditions, the addition of cancer cell-conditioned media greatly increased CD8 +  T-cell proliferation and reduced CD8 +  T-cell apoptosis. These observations suggest that CatS inhibition of Tregs may reduce overall T-cell immunity under normal conditions, but enhance CD8 +  T-cell immunity in the presence of cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "CD74 mediates MHC class-II antigenic peptide loading and presentation and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. C57BL/6  Fas lpr   mice that develop spontaneous lupus-like autoimmunity and pathology showed elevated CD74 expression in the inflammatory cell infiltrates and the adjacent tubular epithelial cells (TECs) in kidneys affected by lupus nephritis but negligible levels in kidneys from age-matched wild-type mice. The inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 or IL-6 induced CD74 expression in kidney TECs in vitro. The presence of kidney TECs from  Fas lpr   mice, rather than from wild-type mice, produced significantly stronger histones, dsDNA, and ribonucleoprotein-Smith Ag complex\u2013induced CD4 +  T cell activation. Splenocytes from CD74-deficient  Fas lpr Cd74 \u2212/\u2212   mice had muted responses in a MLR and to the autoantigen histones. Compared with  Fas lpr Cd74 +/+   mice,  Fas lpr Cd74 \u2212/\u2212   mice had reduced kidney and spleen sizes, splenic activated T cells and B cells, serum IgG and autoantibodies, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, kidney Periodic acid\u2013Schiff score, IgG and C3 deposition, and serum IL-6 and IL-17A levels, but serum IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2 levels were increased. Study of chronic graft-versus-host C57BL/6 mice that received donor splenocytes from B6.C- H2 bm12  /KhEg mice and those that received syngeneic donor splenocytes yielded similar observations. CD74 deficiency reduced lupus-like autoimmunity and kidney pathology in chronic graft-versus-host mice. This investigation establishes the direct participation of CD74 in autoimmunity and highlights a potential role for CD74 in kidney TECs, together with professional APCs in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

Results show that microstructure of the hypereutectic Al-xSi alloys was obviously improved by squeeze casting. The amount of coarse primary Si phase decreased, while that of fine primary \u03b1-Al dendrites increased with the increase of squeeze casting pressure. Due to the decrease of coarse primary Si particles, cracking of the matrix was reduced, whilst the fine microstructure, and mechanical properties of the squeeze casting alloys were improved. Compared with gravity casting alloys, mechanical properties of the hypereutectic Al-xSi alloys solidified at 600\u2009MPa were improved significantly. Hardness of the squeeze casting hypereutectic Al-(15, 17.5, 22\u2009wt%) Si alloys was improved by 15.91%, 12.23%, 17.48%, ultimate tensile strength was improved by 37.85%, 32.27%, 22.74%, and elongation was improved by 55.83%, 167.86%, 126.76%, respectively. Due to the uniform distribution of Si phases in squeeze casting Al-xSi alloys, their wear resistance was markedly enhanced.",

        "abstract": "The effects of squeeze casting process on microstructure and flow stress behavior of Al-17.5Si-4Cu-0.5Mg alloy were investigated and the hot-compression tests of gravity casting and squeeze casting alloy were carried out at 350\u2013500 \u00b0C and 0.001\u20135 s\u22121. The results show that microstructures of Al-17.5Si-4Cu-0.5Mg alloys were obviously improved by squeeze casting. Due to the decrease of coarse primary Si particles, soft \u03b1-Al dendrite as well as the fine microstructures appeared, and the mechanical properties of squeeze casting alloys were improved. However, when the strain rate rises or the deformation temperature decreases, the flow stress increases and it was proved that the alloy is a positive strain rate sensitive material. It was deduced that compared with the gravity casting alloy, squeeze casting alloy (solidified at 632 MPa) is more difficult to deform since the flow stress of squeeze casting alloy is higher than that of gravity casting alloy when the deformation temperature exceeds 400 \u00b0C. Flow stress behavior of Al-17.5Si-4Cu-0.5Mg alloy can be described by a hyperbolic sine form with Zener-Hollomon parameter, and the average hot deformation activation energy Q of gravity casting alloy and squeeze casting alloy is 278.97 and 308.77 kJ/mol, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Self-sustainability after implantation is one of the critical obstacles facing large engineered tissues. A preformed functional vascular network provides an effective solution for solving the mass transportation problem. With the support of mural cells, endothelial cells (ECs) can form microvessels within engineered tissues. As an important mural cell, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) not only stabilize the engineered microvessel network, but also preserve their multi-potency when grown under optimal culture conditions. A prevascularized hMSC/extracellular matrix (ECM) sheet fabricated by the combination of hMSCs, ECs and a naturally derived nanofibrous ECM scaffold offers great opportunity for engineering mechanically strong and completely biological three-dimensional prevascularized tissues. The objective of this study was to create a prevascularized hMSC/ECM sheet by co-culturing ECs and hMSCs on a nanofibrous ECM scaffold. Physiologically low oxygen (2% O ) was introduced during the 7\u00a0day hMSC culture to preserve the stemness of hMSCs and thereby their capability to secrete angiogenic factors. The ECs were then included to form microvessels under normal oxygen (20% O ) for up to 7\u00a0days. The results showed that a branched and mature vascular network was formed in the co-culture condition. Angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) were significantly increased by low-oxygen culture of hMSCs, which further stabilized and supported the maturation of microvessels. A differentiation assay of the prevascularized ECM scaffold demonstrated a retained hMSC multi-potency in the hypoxia cultured samples. The prevascularized hMSC/ECM sheet holds great promise for engineering three-dimensional prevascularized tissues for diverse applications.",

We physically acquired the fixed pattern of the fiber bundle and used it as a prior image in an l<sub>1</sub> norm minimization (l<sub>1</sub>-min) algorithm. We chose an iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm for l<sub>1</sub> norm minimization. In addition to fixed pattern noise removal, this method also improved image contrast while preserving spatial resolution. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated on images obtained from a dark-field illuminated reflectance fiber-optic microscope (DRFM). The iterative l<sub>1</sub>-min algorithm presented in this paper, in combination with the DRFM system that we previously developed, enables high-resolution, high-sensitivity, intrinsic-contrast, and in situ cellular imaging which has great potential in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "Objective:  Nigrostriatal terminal losses are known to progress most rapidly in early-stage Parkinson disease (PD) and then plateau, whereas cortical pathology continues and may provide a better marker of PD progression in later stages. We investigated cortical gyrification indices in patients with different durations of PD, since cortical folding may capture complex processes involving transverse forces of neuronal sheets or underlying axonal connectivity.  Methods:  Longitudinal cohort structural MRI were obtained at baseline, 18 months, and 36 months from 70 patients with PD without dementia and 70 control participants. Cortical local gyrification index (LGI) was compared between controls and PD subgroups based upon duration of illness (DOI,  E , n = 17], 1\u20135 years [PD M , n = 19], u003e5 years [PD L , n = 24]) and adjusted using false discovery rate. Associations between LGI and clinical measurements were assessed using multiple linear regression. Areas having significantly reduced LGI also were analyzed using baseline data from a newly established cohort (PD n = 87, control n = 66) to validate our findings.  Results:  In the longitudinal cohort, PD L  had significantly reduced overall gyrification, and bilaterally in the inferior parietal, postcentral, precentral, superior frontal, and supramarginal areas, compared to controls ( p   M  participants, compared to controls. LGI showed robust correlations with DOI and also was correlated with PD-related clinical measurements. Similar results were obtained in the validation sample.  Conclusions:  Loss of cortical gyrification may be accelerated within the first few years after PD diagnosis, and become particularly prominent in later stages. Thus, it may provide a metric for monitoring progression in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Longitudinal data are common in clinical trials and observational studies, where missing outcomes due to dropouts are always encountered. Under such context with the assumption of missing at random, the weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE) approach is widely adopted for marginal analysis. Model selection on marginal mean regression is a crucial aspect of data analysis, and identifying an appropriate correlation structure for model fitting may also be of interest and importance. However, the existing information criteria for model selection in WGEE have limitations, such as separate criteria for the selection of marginal mean and correlation structures, unsatisfactory selection performance in small-sample set-ups and so on. In particular, there are few studies to develop joint information criteria for selection of both marginal mean and correlation structures. In this work, by embedding empirical likelihood into the WGEE framework, we propose two innovative information criteria named a joint empirical Akaike information criterion (JEAIC) and a joint empirical Bayesian information criterion (JEBIC), which can simultaneously select the variables for marginal mean regression and also correlation structure. Through extensive simulation studies, these empirical-likelihood-based criteria exhibit robustness, flexibility, and outperformance compared to the other criteria including the weighted quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion, the missing longitudinal information criterion and the joint longitudinal information criterion. In addition, we provide a theoretical justification of our proposed criteria, and present two real data examples in practice for further illustration. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": " Hypoalgesic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a condition in which patients with active disease do not perceive and/or report abdominal pain, is associated with serious complications and there is a lack of cost-effective, reliable diagnostic methods to identify \"at-risk\" patients. The voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC's), Na1.7, Na1.8, and Na1.9, are preferentially expressed on nociceptive neurons, and have been implicated in visceral inflammatory pain. At least 29 VGSC single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been implicated in chronic somatic pain syndromes, but little is known about their role in human visceral sensation. We hypothesized that disruptive VGSC polymorphisms result in anti-nociceptive behavior in IBD.  We performed targeted exome sequencing and/or TaqMan genotyping to evaluate the Na1.7, Na1.8, and Na1.9 genes (SCN9A, SCN10A and SCN11A) in 121 IBD patients (including 41 \"hypoalgesic\" IBD patients) and 86 healthy controls. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of polymorphisms were compared among study groups who had undergone characterization of intestinal inflammatory status and abdominal pain experience. Forty-nine total exonic SNPs were identified. The allelic frequency of only one non-synonymous SNP (rs6795970 []) approached significance in hypoalgesic IBD patients when compared to other IBD patients ( = 0.096, Fisher's exact test). Hypoalgesic IBD patients were more likely to be homozygous for this polymorphism (46 vs. 22%,  = 0.01, Fisher's exact test).  This is the first human study to demonstrate a link between a genetic variant of SCN10A and abdominal pain perception in IBD. These findings provide key insights into visceral nociceptive physiology and new diagnostic and therapeutic targets to consider in IBD and other gastrointestinal conditions associated with chronic abdominal pain. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise pathophysiological impact of the rs6795970 polymorphism on human gastrointestinal nociception.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with altered neuronal regulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and release of norepinephrine (NE). As sympathetic innervation of the GI tract modulates motility, blood flow, and immune function, changes in NE signaling may alter the risk of developing IBD. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H), the enzyme responsible for NE production, has been suggested to play a critical role in IBD, however the exact mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that genetic variants of D\u03b2H could increase the risk of IBD. We performed genetic analysis on 45 IBD patients and 74 controls. IBD patients were screened by targeted exome sequencing and compared with NeuroX D\u03b2H single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data of the controls. Serum D\u03b2H protein levels for 15 IBD patients and 13 controls were evaluated using immunoblots and competitive ELISA. Seven SNPs were observed from D\u03b2H targeted exome sequencing in the 45 IBD patients. A single non-synonymous SNP, rs6271 (Arg549Cys), had a significant association with IBD patients; the odds ratio was a 5.6 times higher SNP frequency in IBD patients compared to controls (p = 0.002). We also examined the function and availability of the protein in both the IBD and control patients' sera bearing D\u03b2H Arg549Cys. Both control and IBD subjects bearing the heterozygote allele had statistically lower D\u03b2H protein levels while the intrinsic enzyme activity was higher. This is the first report of a noradrenergic genetic polymorphism (rs6271; Arg549Cys) associated with IBD. This polymorphism is associated with significantly lower levels of circulating D\u03b2H.",

        "abstract": "The hypobaric hypoxic environment in high-altitude areas often aggravates the severity of inflammation and induces brain injury as a consequence. However, the critical genes regulating this process remain largely unknown. The phosphatase wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes, including the regulation of inflammation in normoxia, but its functions in hypoxic inflammation-induced brain injury remain unclear. Here, we established a mouse model of this type of injury and found that WIP1 deficiency augmented the release of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral circulation and brain tissue, increased the numbers of activated microglia/macrophages in the brain, aggravated cerebral histological lesions, and exacerbated the impairment of motor and cognitive abilities. Collectively, these results provide the first in vivo evidence that WIP1 is a critical neuroprotector against hypoxic inflammation-induced brain injury.",

        "abstract": "WIP1, as a critical phosphatase, plays many important roles in various physiological and pathological processes through dephosphorylating different substrate proteins. However, the functions of WIP1 in adipogenesis and fat accumulation are not clear. Here, we report that WIP1-deficient mice show impaired body weight growth, dramatically decreased fat mass, and significantly reduced triglyceride and leptin levels in circulation. This dysregulation of adipose development caused by the deletion of WIP1 occurs as early as adipogenesis. In contrast, lentivirus-mediated WIP1 phosphatase overexpression significantly increases the adipogenesis of pre-adipocytes via an enzymatic activity-dependent mechanism. PPAR\u03b3 is a master gene of adipogenesis, and the phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at serine 112 strongly inhibits adipogenesis; however, very little is known about the negative regulation of this phosphorylation. Here, we show that WIP1 phosphatase plays a pro-adipogenic role by interacting directly with PPAR\u03b3 and dephosphorylating p-PPAR\u03b3 S112 in vitro and in vivo.",

A focused screening and lead optimization effort identified 4b (GS-5734) with anti-EBOV EC50 = 86 nM in macrophages as the clinical candidate. Structure activity relationships established that the 1\u2032-CN group and C-linked nucleobase were critical for optimal anti-EBOV potency and selectivity against host polymerases. A robust diastereoselective synthesis provided sufficient quantities of 4b to enable preclinical efficacy in a non-human-primate EBOV challenge model. Once-daily 10 mg/kg iv treatment on days 3\u201314 postinfection had a significant effect on viremia and mortality, resulting in 100% survival of infected treated animals [Nature 2016, 531, 381\u2212385]. A phase 2 study (PREVAIL IV) is currently enrolling and will evaluate the effect of 4b on viral shedding from sanctuary sites in EBOV survivors.",

This paper deals with effects of atmosphere stability on electromagnetic waves propagation in the evaporation duct environment. A popular evaporation duct model and parabolic equation method are used to model the refractivity profiles and path losses at the same evaporation duct height and seven atmosphere stable classes. Numerical results are presented to highlight the evaporation strength influence. This partly explain some experimental results where the higher signal strength corresponding under stable atmospheric conditions was observed even the duct height was not higher than the unstable atmospheric conditions.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescent sensor arrays with pattern recognition ability have been widely used to detect and identify multiple chemically similar analytes. In the present work, two particular bispyrene fluorophores containing hydrophilic oligo(oxyethylene) spacer, 6 and 4, were synthesized, but one is with and the other is without cholesterol unit. Their ensembles with cationic surfactant (CTAB) assemblies realize multiple fluorescence responses to different metalloproteins, including hemoglobin, myoglobin, ferritin, cytochrome c, and alcohol dehydrogenase. The combination of fluorescence variation at monomer and excimer emission of the two binary sensor ensembles enables the mini sensor array to provide a specific fingerprint pattern to each metalloprotein. Linear discriminant analysis shows that the two-ensemble-sensor-based array could well discriminate the five tested metalloproteins. The present work realizes using a mini sensor array to accomplish discrimination of complex analytes like proteins. They also display a very high sensitivity to the tested metalloproteins with detection limits in the range of picomolar concentration.",

The present work developed a single fluorescent sensor ensemble that can distinguish and identify a variety of heavy metal ions. A pyrene-based fluorophore (PB) containing a metal ion receptor group was specially designed and synthesized. Anionic surfactant SDS assemblies can effectively adjust its fluorescence behavior. The selected binary ensemble based on PB/SDS assemblies can exhibit multiple emission bands and provide wavelength-based cross-reactive responses to a series of metal ions to realize pattern recognition ability. The combination of surfactant assembly modulation and the receptor for metal ions empowers the present sensor ensemble strong discrimination power, which could well differentiate 13 metal ions, including Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Hg2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Al3+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Ba2+. Moreover, this single sensing ensemble could be further applied for identifying different brands of drinking water.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) on the migration of astrocytes. The primary astrocytes of neonatal mice were isolated and cultured in\u00a0vitro, and treated with the PP2A activator D\u2011erythro\u2011sphingosine (DES) (activated group) or inhibitor okadaic acid (inhibitory group). The control group was treated with equal amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide. The activity of PP2A in the cells was detected using a commercial kit and the migration of cells was investigated using a Transwell migration assay. The protein expression of p38, phosphorylated (p)\u2011p38, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)\u20112 and MMP\u20119 was detected by western blotting. Cell migration and the protein expression of p38, p\u2011p38, MMP\u20112 and MMP\u20119 was also determined following treatment of astrocytes with the p38 signaling pathway inhibitor SB202190 with or without the PP2A activator DES. The results demonstrated that the activity of PP2A in the PP2A inhibitory group was significantly decreased compared with the control group, while that of the PP2A\u2011activated cells was significantly increased compared with the control. The protein levels of MMP\u20112 and MMP\u20119 in the PP2A inhibitory group astrocytes were significantly decreased compared with the control group, while PP2A\u2011activated astrocytes exhibited significantly increased levels of these proteins. By contrast, the p\u2011p38 level in PP2A inhibitory group astrocytes was significantly increased compared with the control group, while astrocytes in the activated group exhibited significantly lower levels compared with the control group. Furthermore, the cell migration ability, and MMP\u20112 and MMP\u20119 protein levels, of astrocytes that received combined treatment with SB202190 and the PP2A activator DES were significantly increased compared with the levels in astrocytes treated with SB202190 alone. The results of the current study indicate that PP2A may negatively regulate the p38 signaling pathway to promote astrocyte migration.",

Microglia were divided into four groups: The cells in the control group were treated with an identical amount of PBS, whereas the cells in the CCL2 group were cultured in medium containing 0.05\u00a0ng/\u00b5l CCL2; cells in the \u03b1\u2011synuclein group were treated with medium containing 0.2\u00a0ng/\u00b5l \u03b1\u2011synuclein; and cells in the CCL2 plus \u03b1\u2011synuclein group were cultured in medium containing 0.05\u00a0ng/\u00b5l CCL2 and 0.2\u00a0ng/\u00b5l \u03b1\u2011synuclein. After incubation for 24\u00a0h, the proliferation of glial cells, and the level of \u03b1\u2011synuclein in the cells, were measured. The levels of tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1), interleukin\u20111\u03b2 (IL\u20111\u03b2) and nitric oxide (NO) in the culture medium were also measured. Levels of cleaved caspase\u20113, Akt and phosphorylated (p)\u2011Akt in neurons treated with primary microglia culture medium in each group were subsequently monitored. The proliferation activity and secretion of TNF\u2011\u03b1, IL\u20111\u03b2 and NO in the CCL2, \u03b1\u2011synuclein and CCL2 plus \u03b1\u2011synuclein groups were significantly higher compared with that in the control group (P<0.05), as were the levels of \u03b1\u2011synuclein (P<0.01). The levels of neuronal apoptosis and cleaved caspase\u20113 protein in the CCL2, \u03b1\u2011synuclein and CCL2 plus \u03b1\u2011synuclein groups were also significantly higher compared with that in the control group (P<0.01). Taken together, these results have demonstrated that CCL2 is able to promote \u03b1\u2011synuclein secretion and the apoptosis of neurons induced by \u03b1\u2011synuclein, thus inducing proliferation of the microglia and secretion of TNF\u2011\u03b1, IL\u20111\u03b2 and NO.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a common fatal malignancy in both men and women. Xuanwei, Yunnan has the highest incidence of lung cancer in China. The area has a specific risk factor in the domestic combustion of bituminous coal, and lung cancer patients from this area tend to be resistant to platinum-based treatments. However, little is known about the mechanism of platinum resistance in patients from Xuanwei. Herein, we used lentiviral infection with shRNA to silence expression of the DNA repair enzyme ERCC1 in XWLC05 both in its RNA and protein expression level, a lung adenoma cell line derived from a patient from Xuanwei. ERCC1 expression in this cell line is high and contributes to its resistance to cisplatin. Suppression of ERCC1 decreased XWLC05 proliferation in\u00a0vitro (IC50 of cisplatin 1.34\u00a0\u00b5M for shRNA-infected cells vs. 4.54\u00a0\u00b5M for control cells) and increased the apoptotic rate after treatment with cisplatin (81.2% shRNA cells vs. 58% control cells, P<0.05). Progression-free survival was longer in ERCC1-negative lung adenoma patients than those with high ERCC1 levels (30 vs. 11\u00a0months, P<0.0001). ERCC1 expression was identified as a prognostic marker for overall survival in the patient cohort with operable lesions. Taken together, our data identify ERCC1 as a disease marker in lung adenoma patients from Xuanwei and confirm the significance of resection for the subsequent effect of platinum treatment in these patients. Additional studies are needed to determine the mechanism of ERCC1-induced platinum resistance in lung adenoma patients from Xuanwei.",

The positivity of solutions with positive initial conditions and the expressions of equilibria are obtained. By applying analytic techniques and constructing discrete Lyapunov functions, we obtain the results that if \\(R_0\\le 1\\), the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and if \\(R_0>1\\) the unique endemic equilibrium is also globally asymptotically stable when the system degenerates the fast-slow system. Furthermore, numerical simulations verify our theoretical results. Our numerical results imply that the decay rate of pathogen in the water has no influence on endemic equilibrium, but it has a significant impact on the peak value of infected individuals.",

To cope with this problem, an edge-following-based ellipse detection method is proposed which promotes the performances of the subprocesses based on consistency. The ellipse detector models edge connectivity by line segments and exploits inconsistent endpoints of the line segments to split the edge contours into smooth arcs. The smooth arcs are further refined with a novel arc refinement method which iteratively improves the consistency degree of the smooth arc. A two-phase arc integration method is developed to group disconnected elliptical arcs belonging to the same ellipse, and two constraints based on consistency are defined to increase the effectiveness and speed of the merging process. Finally, an efficient ellipse validation method is proposed to evaluate the saliency of the elliptic hypotheses. Detailed evaluation on synthetic images shows that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art ellipse detection methods in terms of effectiveness and speed. Additionally, we test our detector on three challenging real-world datasets. The F-measure score and execution time of results demonstrate that our method is effective and fast in complicated images. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for practical applications.",

In order to cope with this problem, a novel arc extraction method is proposed based on edge curvature. The method first groups connected pixels to form line segments and then breaks edge contours into smooth arcs at the turning points, inflexion points and noise connection points of the curve. Finally, near distance arcs are reconnected based on edge curvature. In this aspect, two arcs are linked if the new arc has no turning points, inflexion points and noise connection points.

The normalized intensity distribution in the y-direction of the two kinds of Airy-related beams is close to that of the second-order and the third-order elegant Hermite\u2013Gaussian beams, respectively. Analytical expressions of the two kinds of Airy-related beams passing through an ABCD paraxial optical system are derived. The beam propagation factors for the two kinds of Airy-related beams are 1.933 and 2.125, respectively. Analytical expressions of the beam half widths and the kurtosis parameters of the two kinds of Airy-related beams passing through an ABCD paraxial optical system are also presented. As a numerical example, the propagation properties of the two kinds of Airy-related beams are demonstrated in free space. Moreover, the comparison between the two kinds of Airy-related beams and their corresponding elegant Hermite\u2013Gaussian beams along the two transverse directions are performed in detail. Upon propagation, the former kind of Airy-related beam will evolve from the central bright beam into the dark hollow beam. Contrarily, the latter kind of Airy-related beam will evolve from the dark hollow beam into the central bright beam. These two kinds of Airy-related beams can be used to describe specially distributed beams.",

        "abstract": "The Yanliao Biota of northeastern China comprises the oldest feathered dinosaurs, transitional pterosaurs, as well as the earliest eutherian mammals, multituberculate mammals, and new euharamiyidan species that are key elements of the Mesozoic biotic record. Recent discovery of the Yanliao Biota in the Daxishan section near the town of Linglongta, Jianchang County in western Liaoning Province have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the transition from dinosaurs to birds, primitive to derived pterosaurs, and the early evolution of mammals. Nevertheless, fundamental questions regarding the correlation of fossil-bearing strata, rates of dinosaur and mammalian evolution, and their relationship to environmental change in deep time remain unresolved due to the paucity of precise and accurate temporal constraints. These limitations underscore the importance of placing the rich fossil record of Jianchang within a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework that has thus far been hampered by the relatively low precision of in situ radioisotopic dating techniques. Here we present high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology by the chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) from three interstratified ash beds previously dated by secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) technique. The results constrain the key fossil horizons of the Daxishan section to an interval spanning 160.89 to 160.25 Ma with 2\u03c3 analytical uncertainties that range from \u00b146 to \u00b169 kyr. These data place the Yanliao Biota from Jianchang in the Oxfordian Stage of the Late Jurassic, and mark the Daxishan section as the site of Earthu0027s oldest precisely dated feathered dinosaurs and eutherian mammals.",

        "title": "A method of improving the anti-rudder beating of Si micromechanical gyro driven by rotating carrier",
        "abstract": "Abstract   The Si micromechanical gyro driven by rotating carrier is a new kind of MEMS gyro. Since it has no a driving structure itself, it differs from the conventional Coriolis vibratory gyro. The gyro is installed on a rotating aircraft and utilizes the spinning of the carrier as a driving. Its sensing output is a amplitude-modulated signal. The amplitude is proportional to the transverse input angular velocity of the carrier, while frequency tunes the spin frequency of the carrier automatically. So the gyro is used for the damping of the single-channel control system of the rotating carrier. The control system uses a pair of the rudder surfaces to control the flight attitude of the carrier. The polar changing of the rudder surfaces will conduct a beating to the body of the carrier. In application, we found that the rudder beating distorts the gyro output signal. Thus the gyro will not work properly and even cause the channel jam of the control system. Aiming at the problem, in this paper we firstly introduce the structural principle and working mechanism of the gyro, and obtain its angular vibrating equation and the solution of the equation by using Euler dynamics equation of the rigid rotating around a fixed point. Then, we analyzed interference of the rudder beating on the gyro output signal in details. The analyses have indicated that the first harmonic of the rudder beating bring the interfering moment since the force arm between the rudder beating and the sensing axis of the gyro exists. Moreover, we tested the resonant frequency of the gyro. The tested result has shown that the second harmonic of the rudder beating is close to the resonant frequency. The situation will cause the resonance of the gyro. In order to improving the ability of anti-rudder beating of the gyro, we putted forward the installed method of 90\u2009\u00b0 to eliminate the interfering force arm of the first harmonic. In addition, based on the model of the elastic torsion beams, we increased the thickness of the beams and enlarged the resonant frequency to avoid the resonance of the gyro. Finally, we carried out the experimental validation. The experimental results have demonstrated that the method can effectively suppress the influence of rudder beating on the output signal of the Si micromechanical gyro.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Particulate matter (PM), including PM 10  and PM 2.5 , is one of the major impacts on air quality, visibility, climate change, earth radiation balance, and public health. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) are the major components of PM. 804 samples (PM 10  and PM 2.5 ) were simultaneously collected from six urban sites covering 3 districts in Baotou, in January, April, September, and November 2014. As to a long-term study on the effects of carbonaceous aerosol, data were collected annually at Environmental Protection Agency of Baotou (EPB). The concentrations of PM 10  and PM 2.5 , the spatial distribution and content of OC and EC, the relationship between OC and EC, and the formation of secondary organic carbon (SOC) have been investigated. The findings indicated that the concentrations of these particle matter are higher than that in US or European standards. The average concentrations of OC in PM 10  and PM 2.5  follow the order: January u003e November u003e April u003e September; and for EC in PM 10  and PM 2.5  follow the order: January u003e November u003e September u003e April. Affected by metrological factors, it was indicated that high wind speed and low relative humidity were beneficial for removal of OC and EC in January and November. Pearson correlations and cluster analysis on OC and EC concentrations in PM 10  and PM 2.5  with gaseous pollutants (SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO) suggested that OC shared the same emission sources with SO 2  and CO from combustion, while ECu0027s sources mainly came from vehicles exhaust and combustion which contributed to NO 2  as well. The OC concentration is mainly primary in warm months, while it appears secondary in cold months in Baotou. There is a common characteristic among the cities with higher SOC in winter, wherever the coal combustion can lead to the severe pollution. This work is important for the construction of the database of OC and EC concentrations in PM 10  and PM 2.5  at spatial and time intervals, and it can provide scientific suggestion for similar PM atmospheric pollutant control and air quality improvement in Baotou.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Water-soluble ions (WSIs) are major components of PM 2.5  and it is valuable for understanding physical and chemical characteristics, sources, behaviors and formation mechanism of WSIs. Baotou is a traditionally industrial city in semi-arid region and frequently subjected to dust storms from March to May. In recent years, air pollution has been listed as one of the most important environmental problems in Baotou. To investigate the seasonal variations and sources of WSIs in PM 2.5 , the WSIs including SO 4  2\u2212 , NO 3  \u2212 , Cl \u2212 , F \u2212 , NH 4  + , K + , Na + , Ca 2+  and Mg 2+  were monitored at six urban sites in Baotou. The results showed that high concentrations of Ca 2+  and Na +  were found responding to dust storm events, while high concentrations of SO 4  2\u2212 , NO 3  \u2212 , NH 4  + , K +  and Cl \u2212  were observed during haze days. The correlations analysis indicated that excess sulfuric and nitric acid was likely neutralized by carbonate minerals such as calcite, aragonite and dolomite in normal days and cations were fully neutralized during all the sampling periods, while cations were excessive in dust storm days. The concentrations of [NH 4  + \u202f+\u202fSO 4  2\u2212 \u202f+\u202fNO 3  \u2212 ], [Na + \u202f+\u202fCa 2+ \u202f+\u202fMg 2+ ] and [Cl \u2212 \u202f+\u202fK + \u202f+\u202fF \u2212 ] indicated the northwest and southeast region of Baotou presented comparatively high contributions of secondary aerosol and crustal dust, respectively, which were mainly related to the industrial distribution and urbanization process. The cluster analysis, ternary diagram and principal component analysis have a good agreement in source apportionment, where crustal dust sources, secondary aerosol source and the mixture of coal combustion, biomass burning and industrial pollution sources were the main sources of WSIs in PM 2.5 . The seasonal pattern of sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) was September\u202fu003e\u202fApril\u202fu003e\u202fNovember\u202fu003e\u202fJanuary, while the nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) April\u202fu003e\u202fJanuary\u202fu003e\u202fNovember\u202fu003e\u202fSeptember in Baotou. This work evaluated the seasonal variation, distribution and source of WSIs on the basis of its stoichiometry in PM 2.5 , which help to explore the potential sources of these inorganic aerosols and provide scientific suggestion for air quality improvement in Baotou.",

        "abstract": "The G-protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) plays important roles in brain development and tumorigenesis. cDNA data suggest that GPR56 has potential to become a neural stem cell (NSC) or neural progenitor cell (NPC) marker. However, expression of GPR56 protein in human NSC/NPCs was not explored. Using specific antibodies and immunochemistry, we showed that GPR56 was highly expressed in nestin-positive NSC/NPCs in the ventricular/subventricular zone of human and mouse fetal brains, and in cultured neurospheres derived from both human and mouse fetal brains. Downregulation of GPR56 protein occurred earlier than that of nestin in differentiating neurosphere cultures. Loss of GPR56 protein was also evident in well-differentiated glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and betaIII-tubulin-positive neurons. Our data suggest that GPR56 can be used as an NSC/NPC marker within the neural cell lineage, especially in combination with nestin.",

        "abstract": "Small molecule inhibitors that can simultaneously inhibit multiple oncogenic proteins in essential pathways are promising therapeutic chemicals for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To combine the anticancer effects of combretastatins, chalcones and isatins, we synthesized a novel hybrid molecule 3',4',5'-trimethoxy-5-chloro-isatinylchalcone (3MCIC). 3MCIC inhibited proliferation of cultured HepG2 cells, causing rounding-up of the cells and massive vacuole accumulation in the cytoplasm. Paxillin and focal adhesion plaques were downregulated by 3MCIC. Surprisingly, unlike the microtubule (MT)-targeting agent CA-4 that inhibits tubulin polymerization, 3MCIC stabilized tubulin polymers both in living cells and in cell lysates. 3MCIC treatment reduced cyclin B1, CDK1, p-CDK1/2, and Rb, but increased p53 and p21. Moreover, 3MCIC caused GSK3\u03b2 degradation by promoting GSK3\u03b2-Ser9 phosphorylation. Nevertheless, 3MCIC inhibited the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by downregulating \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, cyclin D1 and E2F1. 3MCIC treatment not only activated the caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway, but also caused massive autophagy evidenced by rapid and drastic changes of LC3 and p62. 3MCIC also promoted cleavage and maturation of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D. Using ligand-affinity chromatography (LAC), target proteins captured onto the Sephacryl S1000-C12-3MCIC resins were isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Some of the LAC-MS identified targets, i.e., septin-2, vimentin, pan-cytokeratin, nucleolin, EF1\u03b11/2, EBP1 (PA2G4), cyclin B1 and GSK3\u03b2, were further detected by Western blotting. Moreover, both septin-2 and HIF-1\u03b1 decreased drastically in 3MCIC-treated HepG2 cells. Our data suggest that 3MCIC is a promising anticancer lead compound with novel targeting mechanisms, and also demonstrate the efficiency of LAC-MS based target identification in anticancer drug development.

        "abstract": "Renal tubulointerstitial inflammation has an important role in fibrosis, which is the main pathogenetic alteration associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The left\u2011right determination factor\u00a01 (Lefty\u20111) gene pleiotropically and biologically regulates transforming growth factor, mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase and other signaling pathways, and is considered to have a potential anti\u2011inflammatory function. However, its role in renal tubulointerstitial inflammation, which is often a long\u2011term consequence of renal fibrosis, is currently unknown. In the present study, the effects of adenovirus\u2011mediated overexpression of Lefty\u20111 (Ad\u2011Lefty\u20111\u2011flag) on renal tubulointerstitial inflammation were determined using a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and a rat renal tubular duct epithelial cell line\u00a0(NRK\u201152E), which was treated with lipopolysaccharide\u00a0(LPS). In\u00a0vivo results indicated that the inflammatory response was increased in UUO mice, as evidenced by the increase in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Conversely, Lefty\u20111 significantly reversed the effects of UUO. Furthermore, the results of the in\u00a0vitro study demonstrated that Lefty\u20111 significantly inhibited LPS\u2011induced inflammatory marker expression in cultured NRK\u201152E cells via the nuclear factor (NF)\u2011\u03baB signaling pathway. These results suggested that Lefty\u20111 may ameliorate renal tubulointerstitial inflammation by suppressing NF\u2011\u03baB signaling. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that Lefty\u20111 may be considered a potential novel therapeutic agent for inhibiting renal tubulointerstitial inflammation or even reversing the CKD process.",

        "abstract": "Advanced malignant melanoma is characterized by rapid development, poor prognosis and insensitivity to chemoradiotherapy. Immunotherapy has become one of the primary clinical treatments for malignant melanomas. In recent decades, identifying specific tumour antigens and the enhanced immunoactivity of tumour vaccines has become critical for engineering successful tumour vaccines. As a widely used vaccine carrier, heat shock protein\u00a070 (HSP70) clearly increases the immunogenicity of tumour antigens, such as melanoma\u2011associated antigen A1 (MAGEA1). Based on previous studies, gas\u2011filled ultrasound microbubbles (MBs) were engineered to carry an HSP70\u2011MAGEA1 fusion protein (FP). Following subcutaneous injection around the lymphatic nodes the FP was directly released into the lymph nodes under ultrasonic imaging. The results indicated that the microbubbles enhanced the immunoactivity of FPs more effectively than HSP70\u2011MAGEA1 fusion alone. Additionally, HSP70\u2011MAGEA1 delivered via microbubbles clearly inhibited and delayed the growth of MAGEA1\u2011expressing B16 melanomas in mice and improved the survival times of these animals compared with the fusion protein alone. The results of the present study demonstrated that controlled MBs enhance the immunoactivity of FPs and also highlights novel, potential vaccine carriers and a new strategy for engineering controllable tumour vaccine designs.",

Previous approaches use either specialized equipment or controlled illumination where the extra hardware and high cost prevent many practical applications. In this paper, we focuses on a training-based method to reconstruct the scene\u2019s spectral reflectance from RGB image. We use training images to model the mapping between camera-specific RGB values and scene-specific reflectance spectra. Our method is based on a radial basis function network that leverages RGB white-balancing to normalize the scene illumination and link function to transform the reflectance to recover the scene reflectance. Three link functions (logit, square root 1, square root 2) were evaluated in the training-based estimation of reflectance spectra of the RGB images in the 400\u2013700 nm region. We estimate reflectance spectra from RGB camera responses in color patches\u2019s reflectance reconstruction and a normal scene reconstruction and show that a combination of link function and radial basis function network training-based decreases spectral errors when compared with without link function model.",

If the light sourceu0027s spectrum can be optimized by decreasing the light energy along the absorbed wavelengths, substantial energy can be saved. In this study, a spectrum optimization method by means of a genetic algorithm to minimize the light energy along the absorbed wavelengths while maintaining the light quality of the light source was proposed. Under the constraint that the color differences of the object illuminated by the optimized illuminant and the reference illuminant do not exceed specified levels, maximum energy saving ratio (ESR) is achieved for various reference illuminants. It is found that through the proposed method effectively saving the energy, for a monochromatic object, the ESR can reach 49.5% with barely recognizable color difference, whereas for a polychromatic object, the ESR can reach 55.2% with an acceptable color difference for each patch of the object.",

Therefore, two selection procedures by gradually increasing the induction concentration of tachyplesin I were performed to determine whether tachyplesin I could induce resistance in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. The results showed that tachyplesin I did not induce resistance in Escherichia coli ATCC25922, F41 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 in this study whereas high resistance to benzylpenicillin was induced using the same procedures in Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923. Furthermore, no cross-resistance between tachyplesin I and benzylpenicillin was observed.

However, there is a remarkable paucity of information about its mechanism of action and the risk that it may pose to developing vertebrates. In this study, zebrafish embryos were continually exposed to 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 \u03bcg/ml tachyplesin I at 28 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C from 3, 12, and 24 hr post-fertilization to 96 hr post-fertilization to explore the potential developmental toxicity of tachyplesin I. The results indicated that the embryo hatching rate and survival rate were negatively affected under all treatments. Meanwhile, the embryos displayed a large suite of abnormalities, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, spinal flexion, vasculature defects, and insufficient development. In addition, tachyplesin I also caused oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos and disturbed the normal development of the liver. The findings suggest that tachyplesin I interfered with the normal embryonic development of zebrafish, and there is need more further research on toxicity of tachyplesin I before used as drug. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",

Conventional image dehazing methods which are based on a physical model generally take the global atmospheric light as a constant. However, the constant-airlight assumption may be unsuitable for images with large sky regions, which causes unacceptable brightness imbalance and color distortion in recovery images. This paper models the atmospheric light as a field function, and presents a maximum a-priori (MAP) method for jointly estimating the airlight field, the transmission rate and the haze free image. We also introduce a valid haze-level prior for effective estimate of transmission. Evaluation on real world images shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in single image dehazing, especially when the large sky region is included.",

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) creates principled research directions towards addressing these issues. But we found in practice that gradient penalty WGANs (GP-WGANs) still suffer from training instability. In this paper, we combine a Total Variational (TV) regularizing term into the WGAN formulation instead of weight clipping or gradient penalty, which implies that the Lipschitz constraint is enforced on the critic network. Our proposed method is more stable at training than GP-WGANs and works well across varied GAN architectures.

This approach combines the good qualities of both the NPF and federated filter. In order to combine them, the equivalence relationship between the NPF and classical Kalman filter (KF) is demonstrated from algorithm structure and estimation criterion. The main features of this approach include a nonlinear predictive filtering algorithm to estimate uncertain model errors and determine the spacecraft attitude by using attitude kinematics and dynamics, and a federated filtering algorithm to process measurement data from multiple attitude sensors. Moreover, a fault detection and isolation algorithm is applied to the proposed federated NPF to improve the estimation accuracy even when one sensor fails. Numerical examples are given to verify the navigation performance and fault-tolerant performance of the proposed federated nonlinear predictive attitude determination algorithm.",
