He was treated by praziquantel 25 mg/kg given over 3 days. The pleural effusion and endermic lump gradually vanished, and the blood eosinophilic granulocyte levels recuperated. The case was followed up until now, and a recurrence of symptoms was not found. S. mansoni can cause parasitic infections of the eye, subcutancous tissue, oral and maxillo-facial regions, viscera, central nervous system and lung in humans. However, infection of the bilateral thoracic cavity, subcutaneous tissue and parotid gland together is seldom seen. The diagnosis is generally made by pathology, and immunosorbent assay of the serum may be diagnostically helpful.",

Pulmonary vascular remodeling was observed with optical microscope, and HIF-alpha mRNA and protein were detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry respectively.Vascular remodeling parameters (WT%, WA%) of COPD patients [(24 +/- 3)%, (48 +/- 6)%, respectively] were statistically different from those of the control subjects [(15 +/- 2)%, (39 +/- 4)%, respectively]. Relative quantification of mRNA and protein levels (absorbance, A) showed that HIF-1alpha in COPD group (0.172 +/- 0.011, 0.089 +/- 0.013, respectively) were statistically higher than those of the control subjects (0.103 +/- 0.010, 0.042 +/- 0.010, P < 0.01). Furthermore, they correlated positively with the parameters for vascular remodeling. The mRNA and protein levels of HIF-2alpha in COPD group (0.038 +/- 0.010, 0.077 +/- 0.010, respectively) were significantly lower than those of the control subjects (0.133 +/- 0.017, 0.169 +/- 0.010, respectively, P < 0.01), and correlated negatively with the parameters for vascular remodeling. Regarding HIF-3alpha, only the mRNA level in COPD group (0.077 +/- 0.010) was statistically lower than that of the control subjects (0.088 +/- 0.010) (P < 0.05), and no correlation with vascular remodeling parameters was observed.Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COPD patients was accompanied by the differential expression of HIF-alpha gene, which may be involved in the process of hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling in COPD.",

After 21 days, The mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and right ventricular hypertrophy index[RV/(LV+S)] were measured. Hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling(HPSR) was observed with morphometric analysis. The level of pulmonary arterial plasma ADM was measured by radioimmunoassay. The semiquantitate in situ hybridization was used to measure the expression of ADMR mRNA in pulmonary artery walls. Results (1) The level of mPAP, RV/(LV+S),the ratio of vascular wall thick ness to external diameter(MT%) and ratio of vascular wall area to total area (MA%) were significantly higher in hypoxia group than those in control group(2) The pulmonary artery plasma ADM level was significantly higher in hypoxic group and hypoxic plus ADM group than that in control group(P<0.01), and the ADM level decreased in rat of hypoxicplus ADM group compared with hypoxic group(P<0.05).(3) ADMR mRNA expressed more in pulmonary artery walls of hypoxia group and hypoxic plus ADM group(P<0.01).Conclusion ADM may partly prevent the development of HPH and pulmonary vascular remodling. Exogenous ADM has no negative feedback effect on pulmonary arterial plasma ADM and ADMR mRNA.",

        "abstract": "As one of the way of estimating microbial protein production, urinary purine derivatives(PD) is easier. And it has good consistency with any other ways, but it also has disadvantage. The PD excretion in urine changes and it is not universal in different breeds. So it is exactly in need of kinds of models about different ruminants. Three China Holstein male cattle were fed with three mixed diets of forage and concentrate. In this experiment, a Latin square design was used to research the rules of purine derivatives excretion through observing the relationship between DOMI and PD excretion. It shows that the allantoin ,which only takes little part in calves, was the main part (about73%~88%) in the cattle's urine, and the xanthine and hypoxanthine which are also take only much little part, can be neglected. The PD changed from 414.09mmol/d to 975.59mmol/d with the enhancement of DOM and DCP intake, and the relativity was significant (R2=0.88, n=9). At the same time, the creatine excretion was steady, and not significant(P>0.05). The PDC increased with the enhancement of DOM and DCPI, which was consistent to other's research of cattle and contrary to calves, but the response was lower.",

        "abstract": "A method for studying 20S proteasome inhibitors by capillary electrophoresis (CE) has been developed. Proteasome plays a fundamental role in degrading key regulatory proteins. The 20S proteasome can degrade intrinsically disordered proteins in an ATP-independent manner without additional \"helper\" molecules. The discovery of new proteasome inhibitors with little or no toxicity is highly desirable in anticancer therapy. In this study, the inhibitory effects of MG132 and MG115 on the 20S proteasome were evaluated by CE for the first time. The optimized CE conditions were as follows: fused-silica capillary of 30 cm effective length and 75 microm internal diameter, pressure injection of 0.5 psi for 5 s, 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.6) with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, constant voltage of 20 kV, and detection wavelength at 340 nm. Also, the new method was used to study the inhibitory effects of 30 novel peptidyl vinyl ester derivatives of MG132. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC(50) values) of MG132 and MG115 were 40.0 and 84.7 nM, respectively. Two new compounds, XP32 and XP35, showed considerable inhibitory effects on the 20S proteasome. When the concentrations of them were fixed at 172 nM, their inhibition rates were 36.2% and 29.1%, respectively. The results showed that the CE method was powerful, sensitive, and fast and required little sample. It could be employed as one of the reliable drug screening methods for 20S proteasome inhibitors.",

The target compounds were obtained by condensation, cyanation, hydrolyzation and esterification starting from o-hydroxy benzaldehydes and benzothiazole-2-acetonitrile. The cyanation reaction could only occur when there were electron with drawing groups at C3 position of coumarin scaffold. All the synthesized compounds showed weak binding and inhibition potencies to phosphorylated MEK1 but obvious inhibitory effect to unphosphorylated MEK1, suggesting that compounds inhibition to MEK1 is mainly due to the inhibition of npMEK1 rather than pMEK1. The most potent compound 3 was with an inhibition rate of 60.7% at 1 \u03bcM in the RAF-MEK cascading assay. Molecular docking studies revealed that the pocket occupation and structure hydrophobicity may be important for activity. These results can contribute to further optimization on coumarin scaffold and led to the design of novel coumarin derivatives as more potent MEK1 inhibitors. \u00a92013 Bentham Science Publishers.",

Two stereogenic centers were introduced during synthesis, including one chiral sulfoxide in a five-membered ring. The absolute configurations (AC) of these two compounds were hard to determine just based on experimental techniques. Therefore, theoretical calculations of chiro-optical and spectroscopic features were used to determine stereochemistry. Ab initio calculations at DFT/B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level of theory obtained satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, there was good agreement between the calculations of optical rotations and hydrogen chemical shifts in 1H NMR spectra for the final AC assignment as (1\u2032S, 2R, 5R)- and (1\u2032S, 2S, 5S)-5-[1\u2032-(t-Boc-amino)-3\u2032-methylbutyl]-1,3,2-dioxathiolane-2-oxide.

Based on our previous report, the CoSBC exhibited high binding affinity with MEK1 protein. To further explore metal complexes as MEK1 inhibitors, a series of transition metals and ligands were employed to build a library of various metal Schiff base complexes. The MEK inhibition assays revealed that only CoSBC exhibited obvious inhibitory activity, complex 2b showed the best inhibition both in BRaf (B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma)/MEK1 and MEK1/ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases-2) cascading (IC is 1.988\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14\u202f\u03bcM and 1.589\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.054\u202f\u03bcM respectively). In addition, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence test method was used to prove that CoSBC as ATP-noncompetitive MEK1 inhibitor. MEK kinase selectivity assay indicated that CoSBC can selectively inhibit MEK1/2 kinases rather than other MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) family kinases. Moreover, the interaction mode of 2b with MEK1 protein has been demonstrated by computer aided drug design.",

        "abstract": "Objective To sequence the whole genome of a clinically isolated enterovirus 71(EV71) strain BC08,investigate its pathogenicity and develop an EV71-infection mouse model.Methods Full length of viral RNA was amplified from our previously isolated EV71 strain BC08 by RT-PCR and 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE-PCR.Three overlapped amplified fragments covering the full genome were cloned into pGEM-Teasy vector for sequencing and data were analyzed by software MEGA5 and RNAstructure 5.3.At the same time,imprinting control region(ICR) mice were intraperitoneally challenged with BC08 strain and its pathogenicity was evaluated by anatomopathology and the mortality rate.Results The full-length of EV71 BC08 genome is 7406 nucleotides(GenBank accession:JQ514785).BC08 isolate is classified into sub-genotype C4a of EV71 by phylogenetic analysis.Sequence analysis showed that the A627 in 5\u2032 UTR may lead its secondary structure to form a short stem and loop structure in the viral internal ribosome site(IRES).The infected ICR mice demonstrated neurological complications and high morbidity rate.Immunohistochemistry detected positive VP1 capsid protein expression in both brain and muscle tissue.Conclusions Full genome sequencing analysis identified the BC08 isolate as the EV71 C4a sub-genotype and highly homology in nucleotide sequence with other recently prevalent EV71 strains in mainland of China.The A627 in the 5\u2032 UTR of this isolate might be important for the high pathogenicity in both infected infants and IRC mice.",

        "abstract": "There is widespread interest in the application, optimization, and evolution of the transition-metal-catalyzed arylation of N-heteroarenes to discover full-color tunable fluorescent core frameworks. Inspired by the versatile roles of pyridazinone in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry, herein, we report a simple and efficient copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction for the N-functionalization of pyridazinones in neat water. To achieve the efficient conversion of pyridazinones and organic halides in aqueous phase, a series of copper-salen complexes composed of different Schiff base ligands were investigated by rational design. A final choice of fine-tuned hydrophilicity balanced with lipophilicity among the candidates was confirmed, which affords excellent activity towards the reaction of a wide range of pyridazinones and organic halides. More importantly, the products as N-substituted pyridazinones were synthesized rationally by this methodology as full-color tunable fluorescent agents (426-612\u2005nm). The N2 position of pyridazinones was modified by different aryl group such as benzothiazole, N,N-dimethylaniline, 3-quinoline, 4-isoquinoline and 2-thiophene, resulting in a series of full-color tunable fluorescent reagents. Meanwhile, the effects of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups of the 6-substituted phenyl ring have also been investigated to optimize the fluorescent properties. These fluorescent core frameworks were studied in several cell lines as fluorescent dyes. Different colors from blue to red were observed by using fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy.",

In this work, a new method to obtain PNA monomers and PNA chain prolongation by Ugi four-component condensation reaction was tested by synthesizing PNA monomers and dimers. This method differs from classical peptide chemistry in that no prior preparation of PNA monomers is needed as they are built up along with the extension of chain.

        "abstract": "We report in this work the discovery of novel allosteric MEK inhibitors by pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening. Two out of 13 virtual hit compounds were identified as MEK kinase inhibitors using a MEK1 binding assay. Structural derivations on the hit compound M100 (IC\u202f=\u202f27.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.5\u202f\u03bcM in RAF-MEK cascading assay) by substituent transformation and bioisosterism replacement have led to the synthesis of a small library of carbazoles. The enzymatic studies revealed the preliminary structure-activity relationships and the derivative 22k (IC\u202f=\u202f12.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202f\u03bcM) showed the most potent inhibitory effect against Raf-MEK cascading. Compound 7 was discovered as toxic as M100 to tumor cells whereas safer to HEK293\u202fcells (IC\u202f>\u202f100\u202f\u03bcM) than M100 (IC\u202f=\u202f8.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.0\u202f\u03bcM). It suggests that carbazole is a good scaffold for the design of novel MEK inhibitors for therapeutic uses. More importantly, the developed pharmacophore model can serve as a reliable criterion in novel MEK inhibitor discovery.",

        "abstract": "Two novel series of RGD-MEKI conjugates derived from a MEK1/2 kinase inhibitor--PD0325901--have been developed for integrin receptor mediated anticancer therapy. The first series, alkoxylamine analog RGD-MEKI conjugates 9a-g showed anti-proliferation activity in melanoma A375 cells by the same mechanism as that of PD0325901. PEGylation increased the IC50 value of 9f three-fold in the A375 assay, and the multi-cRGD peptide cargo significantly improved the receptor specific anti-proliferation activity of 9g in integrin-overexpressing U87 cells. In the second series, RGD-PD0325901 13 exhibited significantly increased antitumor properties compared to the alkoxylamine analogs by both inhibition of the ERK pathway activity and DNA replication of the cancer cells. Furthermore, 13 displayed more potent anti-proliferation activity in the U87 assay than PD0325901 in a dose-dependent manner. All these data demonstrate that RGD-MEKI conjugates with an ester bond linkage enhanced anticancer efficacy with improved targeting capability toward integrin-overexpressing tumor cells.",

It was found that isobutyl group was a better R3 substitution as C-terminus in our target compounds, and 4-nitrobenzyl group was the best R2 side chain. With the aid of molecular modeling, the binding modes of compounds 9 and 22 with beta-secretase were compared. The result revealed a stronger bonding mode of 22 than 9. This explored that the optimal length of this series of peptidomimetic inhibitors was P3-P2'. The molecular weights of compounds with this length are around 600.",

        "abstract": "In a previous study the ERK1/2 pathway was found to be crucially involved in positive regulation of the enterovirus A 71(EV-A71) IRES (vIRES), thereby contributing to the efficient replication of an important human enterovirus causing death in young children (<5yrs) worldwide. This study focuses on unraveling more about the detailed mechanism of ERK's involvement in this regulation of vIRES. Through the use of siRNAs and specifically pharmacological inhibitor U0126, the ERK cascade was shown to positively regulate EV-A71-mediated cleavage of eIF4GI that established the cellular conditions which favour vIRES-dependent translation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the viral 2A protease (2A) was undertaken to show that the positive regulation of virus replication by the ERK cascade was mediated through effects on both the cis-cleavage of the viral polyprotein by 2A and its trans-cleavage of cellular eIF4GI. This ERK-2A linked network coordinating vIRES efficiency was also found in other important human enteroviruses. This identification of the ERK cascade as having a key role in maintaining the 2A proteolytic activity required to maximize enterovirus IRES activity, expands current understanding of the diverse functions of the ERK signaling cascade in the regulation of viral translation, therefore providing a potentially comprehensive drug target for anti-enterovirus infection.",

The design strategy involves stepwise extension and modification of pyridazinone by 1)\u2005expansion of pyridazinone to phthalazinone, a larger conjugated system, as the electron acceptor, 2)\u2005coupling of electron-donating aromatic groups such as N,N-diethylaminophenyl, thienyl, naphthyl, and quinolyl to the phthalazinone, and 3)\u2005anchoring of an alkyl chain to the phthalazinone with various terminal substituents such as triphenylphosphonio, morpholino, triethylammonio, N-methylimidazolio, pyrrolidino, and piperidino. Theoretical calculations were utilized to verify the initial design. The desired fluorescent probes were synthesized by two different routes in considerable yields. Twenty-two phthalazinone derivatives were synthesized and their photophysical properties were measured. Selected compounds were applied in cell imaging, and valuable information was obtained. Furthermore, the designed compounds showed excellent performance in two-photon microscopic imaging of mouse brain slices. ",

In the fringe-illumination deflectometry based on reverse-Hartmann-test configuration, the calibration of system geometry is required to achieve \"null\" testing. However, the system miscalibration can introduce a significant systematic error in the testing results. A general double-step calibration method, which is based on the low-order Zernike aberration optimization and high-order aberration separation, is proposed to separate and eliminate the geometrical error due to system miscalibration. Both the numerical simulation and experiments have been performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed calibration method. The proposed method provides a general way for the accurate calibration of system geometrical error, avoids the over-correction and is feasible for the testing of various complex freeform surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Activation of the ERK signaling cascade in host cells has been demonstrated to be essential for Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) replication. Our previous study showed that MEK kinase, which specially activated downstream ERK kinase, is an important and potential target against EV-A71. Furthermore, we reported that a series of substituted 3-benzylcoumarins designed and synthesized as well as verified for inhibiting the MEK-ERK cascade were found to be effective on anti-EV-A71. In this study, we further demonstrated that two substituted 3-benzylcoumarins designated as 13 and 14 were more effective anti-MEK/ERK activity, less cytotoxicity and stronger antiviral effect represented by inhibition of viral-induced CPE, the expression of viral proteins and the replication of the viral genome, as well as the production of progeny virions, compared to those of U0126, an available MEK inhibitor, and sorafenib, a multiple-targeted kinase inhibitor in clinical use. Moreover, we explored that the likely mechanism of action of these two test compounds were to block EV-A71 2A dependent IRES-driven activity essential for successful viral replication. Hence, our results suggest that two substituted 3-benzylcoumarins 13 and 14 could be candidates as potential anti-EV-A71 agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a kind of RNA virus and one of the two causes of Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Inhibitors that target key components of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in host cells could impair replication of EV71. A series of 3-benzyl-1,3-benzoxazine-2,4-diones were designed from a specific MEK inhibitor  G8935 , by replacing the double bond between C3 and C4 within the coumarin scaffold with amide bond. One compound ( 9f ) showed submicromolar inhibitory activity among the 12 derivatives. Further optimization on  9f  led to two active compounds ( 9k  and  9m ) with nanomolar bioactivities (55\u00a0nM and 60\u00a0nM). The results of enzymatic assays also demonstrated that this series of compounds were allosteric inhibitors of unphosphorylated MEK1. The binding mode of compound  9k  was predicted by molecular dynamic simulation and the key interactions were same as published MEK1/2 allosteric inhibitors. In the cell-based assays, compounds  9k  and  9m  could effectively suppress the ERK1/2 pathway, expression of EV71 VP1, and EV71 induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells.",

        "abstract": "MiR-374a appears to play a complex role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we demonstrate a dual role for miR-374a in NSCLC pathogenesis. The effects and modulatory mechanisms of miR-374a on cell growth, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis in nude mice were also analyzed. The expression of miR-374a was examined in NSCLC and non-cancerous lung tissues by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and in situ hybridization, respectively. miR-374a directly targets CCND1 and inactivates PI3K/AKT and Ras-mediated cell cycle signalings, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This not only dramatically suppressed cell growth, migration, invasion,and metastasis, but also elevated A549 and pc-9 NSCLC cell sensitivity to cisplatin (DDP) while increasing survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, miR-374a serves an inverse function in SPCA-1 and H1975 NSCLC cells by directly targeting PTEN to activate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Ras signalings and its downstream cascade signals. Surprisingly, transcription factor c-Jun bound to the promoter region of human miR-374a and suppressed miR-374a in A549 and pc-9 cells while inducing it in SPCA-1 and H1975 cells. Increased levels of miR-374a appeared to serve a protective role by targeting CCND1 in early-stage NSCLC (Stages I and II). Inversely, increased miR-374a was an unfavorable factor when targeting PTEN in more advanced staged NSCLC patients. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that miR-374a plays divergent roles in NSCLC pathogenesis at different stages of the disease and implicate the potential application of miR-374a targeting for cancer therapy.",

We previously used pairs of CRISPR-Cas9 (refs. 1, 2, 3) single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for small-scale functional screening of lncRNAs. Here we demonstrate genome-wide screening of lncRNA function using sgRNAs to target splice sites and achieve exon skipping or intron retention. Splice-site targeting outperformed a conventional CRISPR library in a negative selection screen targeting 79 ribosomal genes. Using a genome-scale library of splicing-targeting sgRNAs, we performed a screen covering 10,996 lncRNAs and identified 230 that are essential for cellular growth of chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Screening GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells and HeLa cells with the same library identified cell-type-specific differences in lncRNA essentiality. Extensive validation confirmed the robustness of our approach.",

We report a high-throughput genomic deletion strategy to screen for functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that is based on a lentiviral paired-guide RNA (pgRNA) library. Applying our screening method, we identified 51 lncRNAs that can positively or negatively regulate human cancer cell growth. We validated 9 of 51 lncRNA hits using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genomic deletion, functional rescue, CRISPR activation or inhibition and gene-expression profiling.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) plays an important role in pathological conditions, such as cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Fluorescent probes may serve as valuable tools to detect the amount, temporal and spatial distribution of H 2 O 2  in living cells. To investigate the role of lysosomal H 2 O 2  involved in cerebral I-R injury, we designed and synthesized a lysosome-targetable two-photon fluorescent probe  ztl-4 , through expansion and substitution of the original pyridazinone scaffold, conjugation of electronic-donating aromatic ring and precise terminal modification of the alkyl linker. The probe  ztl-4  exhibited fast, sensitive and highly selective response toward H 2 O 2 .  ztl-4  could image exogenous H 2 O 2  in SH-SY5Y cells and brain slices. In addition,  ztl-4  was located in lysosomes with high colocalization coefficient compared with LysoTracker.  ztl-4  was further applied for detecting the endogenous generation of H 2 O 2  in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or OGD/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury. Both OGD- and OGD/R-induced cell injury caused a time-dependent increase of H 2 O 2  production within lysosomes. Moreover, OGD/R-treated cells showed much more amount of H 2 O 2  than OGD-treated cells, indicating that reoxygenation will promote H 2 O 2  accumulation in lysosomes of post-hypoxia cells. Therefore, the probe is suitable for monitoring the dynamic changes of lysosomal H 2 O 2  in cells.",

We here report a strategy for designing high-affinity and high-specificity serine protease inhibitors using a versatile peptide scaffold, a 10-mer peptide, mupain-1 (CPAYSRYLDC). Mupain-1 was previously reported as a specific inhibitor of murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Ki = 0.55 \u03bcM) without measurable affinity to plasma kallikrein (Ki > 1000 \u03bcM). Based on a structure-based rational design, we substituted 5 residues of mupain-1 and converted it to a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor (Ki = 0.014 \u03bcM). X-ray crystal structure analysis showed that the new peptide was able to adapt a new set of enzyme surface interactions by a slightly changed backbone conformation. Thus, with an appropriate re-engineering, mupain-1 can be re-designed to specific inhibitors of other serine proteases.",

        "abstract": "A series of deferiprone-resveratrol hybrids have been designed and synthesized as multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) through merging the chelating moiety 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one into the structure of resveratrol, a natural antioxidant agent and \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) aggregation inhibitor. The in\u00a0vitro biological evaluation revealed that most of these newly synthesized compounds exhibited good inhibitory activity against self-induced A\u03b2 aggregation, excellent antioxidant activity and potent metal chelating capability. Compounds 3i and 4f were identified as the most promising MTDLs with triple functions, possessing micromolar IC values for A\u03b2 aggregation inhibition, greater 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) scavenging activity than Trolox and similar pFe(III) values to that of deferiprone.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the central mechanism of acupuncture intervention in dysmnesia in abstinent methamphetamine abusers and to consider improvement in cognitive disorder as the main strategy of treatment.Method NuAmps(a 40-channel event-related potential system) was used to record and compare the responses of persons withdrawing from methamphetamine to three kinds of Chinese characters(including main drug-related words,secondary drug-related words and unrelated words) from different memory loads and to analyze the corresponding relationship between working memory status and ERP change in abstinent methamphetamine abusers before and after acupuncture treatment.Result P3 amplitude was significantly higher in the 1-back load condition than in the 2-back load condition in the abstinent methamphetamine abusers after acupuncture treatment(P<0.05).There was a statistically significant difference in P3 peak value in the 1-back load condition(P<0.05) and no significant difference in the 2-back load condition between before and after acupuncture treatment in the abstinent methamphetamine abusers.A simple analysis showed a significant between-group difference in P3 peak value in the parietal area(PZ electrode).There was a statistically significant between-group difference in P3 peak value in the 1-back load condition(P<0.05) and no significant between-group difference in the 2-back load condition in the abstinent methamphetamine abusers before and after acupuncture treatment.The N450 component of the difference waves was distributed mainly in the parietal area and extensively in the brain regions.Conclusion The PZ electrode is an electrode with which a more obvious P3 component is recorded in drug-related N-back tasks.Through acting on this site of memory,acupuncture may produce a therapeutic effect on methamphetamine-induced dysmnesia.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effect of electroacupuncture(EA) on expression of phosphorylated (pAkt) and caspase-3 proteins in the skeletal muscle in mice with diabetes, so as to provide experimental evidence for treating diabetic myopathy in clinic.Eighteen C 57 mice were equally randomized into control, model and EA groups (n = 6 mice/ group). Type 1 diabetic model was established by streptozotocin (STZ, i. P., 200 mg/kg). EA (1 mA, 20-30 Hz) was applied to bilateral \"Zusanli\"(ST 36) and \"Yanglingquan\" (GB 34) for 20 min, once daily for 14 days. Damp weights of the musculus soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior were measured, and Western blot was used to measure the expression levels of pAkt (ser 473), pAkt(Thr 308), total Akt and caspase-3 proteins in the aforementioned skeleton muscles.Compared with the normal control group, the weights of the musculus soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior were decreased obviously in the model group (P < 0.01). After EA treatment, the weights of the 5 skeleton muscles were all increased apparently compared with the model group (P < 0.05). In comparison with the normal control group, muscular pAkt (Thr 308) protein expression level was down-regulated significantly in the model group (P < 0.01), while that of muscular caspase-3 protein expression of the model group was up-regulated considerably (P < 0.01). Following EA, the expression levels of muscular pAkt (Thr 308) and pAkt (ser 473) in the EA group were upregulated apparently (P < 0.01), while that of muscular caspase-3 protein was down-regulated obviously (P < 0.01). No significant differences were found between the control and model groups in the expression levels of muscular pAkt (ser 473) and total Akt proteins (P > 0.05).EA intervention can effectively up-regulate expression of pAkt (Thr 308 and ser 473) and down-regulate expression of caspase-3 protein in the skeleton muscle in diabetic mice, which may contribute to its effect in inhibiting diabetic myopathy.",

SDUZAWQ can effectively desulfurize benzo[b]thiophene (BT), DBT and their derivatives. In two days, BT and DBT were degraded completely and 86% of BT was desulfurized in 24 h with the degrading rate being higher than that of DBT. The rate of 5-methyl-benzo[b] thiophene (5-MBT) was also higher than those of DBT derivatives, 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) and 4- methyldibenzothiophene (4-MDBT). The degradation of 4-MDBT was more refractory than that of 4,6-DMDBT. In 48 h, 62% of 4,6-DMDBT was degraded, but only 36% of 4-MDBT was desulfurized under the same conditions.",

        "abstract": "Some of Bacillus strains, especially Bacillus pumilus, were the best acetoin producers. This study attempts to disclose the mechanisms of vigorous acetoin excretion using B. pumilus ATCC 14884 as a model strain. The production of acetoin by this strain has been studied under a variety of conditions.Glucose was found to be a much better substrate than citrate, pyruvate, succinate, or fumarate for acetoin production. Malonate was used to slow down the Krebs cycle and the addition of 0.10 M malonate was found to inhibit cell growth slightly, but reduce the production of acetoin by 13%. The addition of 100 g/L NaCl strongly reduced cell growth and acetoin formation. On the other hand, 200 g/L glucose reduced the rate of cell growth, but led to the largest final acetoin production of all the conditions studied. Linear relationships between acetoin accumulation and cell biomass, which increased in the lag and arithmetic growth phases were found when glucose was used as the carbon source, which corroborated acetoin as a primary metabolite. Metabolite study indicated that there were few minor pathways for by-products. Acetoin was utilized as a preferential carbon source without the catabolite repression of glucose, suggesting that the main physiological function of acetoin excretion is an energy-storing strategy in this species. \u00a9 2010 Academic Journals.",

        "abstract": "Microbial oxidative degradation is a potential way of removing pollutants such as heterocycles from the environment. During this process, reactive oxygen species or other oxidants are inevitably produced, and may cause damage to DNA, proteins, and membranes, thereby decreasing the degradation rate. Carotenoids can serve as membrane-integrated antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative stress.Several genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway were cloned and characterized from a carbazole-degrading bacterium Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5. In addition, a yellow-pigmented carotenoid synthesized by strain XLDN2-5 was identified as zeaxanthin that was synthesized from \u03b2-carotene through \u03b2-cryptoxanthin. The amounts of zeaxanthin and hydrogen peroxide produced were significantly and simultaneously enhanced during the biodegradation of heterocycles (carbazole < carbazole + benzothiophene < carbazole + dibenzothiophene). These higher production levels were consistent with the transcriptional increase of the gene encoding phytoene desaturase, one of the key enzymes for carotenoid biosynthesis.Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5 can enhance the synthesis of zeaxanthin, one of the carotenoids, which may modulate membrane fluidity and defense against intracellular oxidative stress. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the positive role of carotenoids in the biodegradation of heterocycles, while elucidating the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the Sphingobium genus.",

        "abstract": "With genomic sequences of many closely related bacterial strains made available by deep sequencing, it is now possible to investigate trends in prokaryotic microevolution. Positive selection is a sub-process of microevolution, in which a particular mutation is favored, causing the allele frequency to continuously shift in one direction. Wide scanning of prokaryotic genomes has shown that positive selection at the molecular level is much more frequent than expected. Genes with significant positive selection may play key roles in bacterial adaption to different environmental pressures. However, selection pressure analyses are computationally intensive and awkward to configure.Here we describe an open access web server, which is designated as PSP (Positive Selection analysis for Prokaryotic genomes) for performing evolutionary analysis on orthologous coding genes, specially designed for rapid comparison of dozens of closely related prokaryotic genomes. Remarkably, PSP facilitates functional exploration at the multiple levels by assignments and enrichments of KO, GO or COG terms. To illustrate this user-friendly tool, we analyzed Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus genomes and found that several genes, which play key roles in human infection and antibiotic resistance, show significant evidence of positive selection. PSP is freely available to all users without any login requirement at: http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/PSP/.PSP ultimately allows researchers to do genome-scale analysis for evolutionary selection across multiple prokaryotic genomes rapidly and easily, and identify the genes undergoing positive selection, which may play key roles in the interactions of host-pathogen and/or environmental adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Propenylbenzenes are common aromatic compounds that are often used as starting compounds for the production of various flavours. Recently, microbial transformation has emerged as an important approach for producing natural flavours in high quantities. Because the biotransformation processes are environmentally friendly and the products are considered 'natural', flavour production using this method is attracting more and more attention. This paper reviews recent advances in the application of microbial metabolism to propenylbenzenes and in subsequent flavour production. Vanillin, a valuable aromatic compound, is used as a model to show recent progress in high-value natural flavour production. Future research should focus on metabolic-mechanism characterisation and on optimisation of biotransformation to improve the yields of target products for scale-up and industrial use.",

        "abstract": "A biphenyl (BP)-utilizing bacterium, designated B6-2, was isolated from soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida. BP-grown B6-2 cells were capable of transforming dibenzofuran (DBF) via a lateral dioxygenation and meta-cleavage pathway. The ring cleavage product 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxo-3'H-benzofuran-2'-yliden)but-2-enoic acid (HOBB) was detected as a major metabolite. B6-2 growing cells could also cometabolically degrade DBF using BP as a primary substrate. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain DH10B (pUC118bphABC) expressing BP dioxygenase, BP-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase was shown to be capable of transforming DBF to HOBB. Using purified HOBB that was produced by the recombinant as the substrate for B6-2, we newly identified a series of benzofuran derivatives as metabolites. The structures of these metabolites indicate that an unreported HOBB degradation pathway is employed by strain B6-2. In this pathway, HOBB is proposed to be transformed to 2-oxo-4-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)butanoic acid and 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)butanoic acid (D4) through two sequential double-bond hydrogenation steps. D4 is suggested to undergo reactions including decarboxylation and oxidation to produce 3-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)propanoic acid (D6). 3-Hydroxy-3-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)propanoic acid (D7) and 2-(3'-oxobenzofuran-2'-yl)acetic acid (D8) would represent metabolites involved in the processes of beta- and alpha-oxidation of D6, respectively. D7 and D8 are suggested to be transformed to their respective products 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (D10) and 2-(3'-hydroxy-2',3'-dihydrobenzofuran-2'-yl)acetic acid. D10 is proposed to be transformed to salicylic acid (D14) via 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzofuran, 2-oxo-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid and 2-hydroxy-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid. Further experimental results revealed that B6-2 was capable of growing with D14 as the sole carbon source. Because benzofuran derivatives may have biological, pharmacological, and toxic properties, the elucidation of this new pathway should be significant from both biotechnological and environmental views.",

        "abstract": "Production of flavors from natural substrates by microbial transformation has become a growing and expanding field of study over the past decades. Vanillin, a major component of vanilla flavor, is a principal flavoring compound used worldwide. Streptomyces sp. strain V-1 is known to be one of the most promising microbial producers of natural vanillin from ferulic acid. Although identification of the microbial genes involved in the biotransformation of ferulic acid to vanillin has been previously reported, purification and detailed characterization of the corresponding enzymes with important functions have rarely been studied. In this study, we isolated and identified 2 critical genes, fcs and ech, encoding feruloyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase, respectively, which are involved in the vanillin production from ferulic acid. Both genes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resting cell reactions for converting ferulic acid to vanillin were performed. The corresponding crucial enzymes, Fcs and Ech, were purified for the first time and the enzymatic activity of each purified protein was studied. Furthermore, Fcs was comprehensively characterized, at an optimal pH of 7.0 and temperature of 30\u00b0C. Kinetic constants for Fcs revealed the apparent Km, kcat, and Vmax values to be 0.35 mM, 67.7 s(-1), and 78.2 U mg(-1), respectively. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) value of Fcs was 193.4 mM(-1) s(-1) for ferulic acid. The characterization of Fcs and Ech may be helpful for further research in the field of enzymatic engineering and metabolic regulation.",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive study of novel microbial organisms capable of degrading fluorene is crucial to develop essential strategies for further application on enhanced bioremediation technologies. Many fluorene-degrading bacteria have been studied; however, little information about the genome sequences of these organisms, which would facilitate investigation of the molecular mechanisms of fluorene degradation, is available. In this study, a bacterial strain designated SMT-1, which uses fluorene as its sole carbon source, was isolated from Laogang landfill in Shanghai, People's Republic of China, and identified as a  sp., based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Maximum growth and degrading activity of strain SMT-1 were observed at 30\u00b0C, pH 7.0 and 200\u2009r/min in mineral salt medium containing 0.4\u2009mm fluorene. We obtained a draft genome sequence of strain SMT-1 to gain insight into the genetic mechanisms for the degradation of aromatic compounds. Sequences greater than 1\u2009kb in length were obtained by Illumina sequencing; strain SMT-1 was found to contain 5542 predicted genes. This working draft genome comprises 68 contigs and DNA scaffolds and has a total size of 6\u2009108\u2009237\u2009bp and a calculated G\u2009+\u2009C content of 61.59%. Amino acid metabolism clusters were enriched in  genes annotation, with the highest abundant observed for the \"ABC transporters\" subcategories, followed by transcription, energy production and conversion, and inorganic ion transport and metabolism. The genomic information for SMT-1 provides a useful resource for elucidating the molecular mechanism of fluorene catabolism.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the flavin utilization by dibenzothiophene monooxygenase (DszC), DszC of a desulfurizing bacterium Mycobacterium goodii X7B was purified from the recombinant Escherichia coli. It was shown to be able to utilize either FMNH(2) or FADH(2) when coupled with a flavin reductase that reduces either FMN or FAD. Sequence analysis indicated that DszC was similar to the C(2) component of p-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase from Acinetobacter baumannii, which can use both FADH(2) and FMNH(2) as substrates. Both flavins at high concentrations could inhibit the activity of DszC due to autocatalytic oxidation of reduced flavins. The results suggest that DszC should be reclassified as an FMNH(2) and FADH(2) both-utilizing monooxygenase component and the flavins should be controlled at properly reduced levels to obtain optimal biodesulfurization results.",

        "abstract": "Arthrobacter is one of the most prevalent genera of nicotine-degrading bacteria; however, studies of nicotine degradation in Arthrobacter species remain at the plasmid level (plasmid pAO1). Here, we report the bioinformatic analysis of a nicotine-degrading Arthrobacter aurescens M2012083, and show that the moeB and mogA genes that are essential for nicotine degradation in Arthrobacter are absent from plasmid pAO1. Homologues of all the nicotine degradation-related genes of plasmid pAO1 were found to be located on a 68,622-bp DNA segment (nic segment-1) in the M2012083 genome, showing 98.1% nucleotide acid sequence identity to the 69,252-bp nic segment of plasmid pAO1. However, the rest sequence of plasmid pAO1 other than the nic segment shows no significant similarity to the genome sequence of strain M2012083. Taken together, our data suggest that the nicotine degradation-related genes of strain M2012083 are located on the chromosome or a plasmid other than pAO1. Based on the genomic sequence comparison of strain M2012083 and six other Arthrobacter strains, we have identified 17 \u03c3(70) transcription factors reported to be involved in stress responses and 109 genes involved in environmental adaptability of strain M2012083. These results reveal the molecular basis of nicotine degradation and survival capacities of Arthrobacter species.",

However, the L-lactate-utilizing enzymes in Pseudomonas have never been identified and further studied.An NAD-independent L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-iLDH) was purified from the membrane fraction of Pseudomonas stutzeri SDM. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of L-lactate to pyruvate by using FMN as cofactor. After cloning its encoding gene (lldD), L-iLDH was successfully expressed, purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain, and characterized. An lldD mutant of P. stutzeri SDM was constructed by gene knockout technology. This mutant was unable to grow on L-lactate, but retained the ability to grow on pyruvate.It is proposed that L-iLDH plays an indispensable function in Pseudomonas L-lactate utilization by catalyzing the conversion of L-lactate into pyruvate.",

In this study, we constructed an efficient biocomposite by assembling Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto the surface of Sphingomonas sp. XLDN2-5 cells. The average particle size of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was about 20 nm with 45.5 emu g-1 saturation magnetization. The morphology of Sphingomonas sp. XLDN2-5 cells before and after Fe3O4 nanoparticle loading was verified by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electronic microscopy. Compared with free cells, the microbial cell/Fe3O4 biocomposite had the same biodegradation activity but exhibited remarkable reusability. The degradation activity of the microbial cell/Fe3O4 biocomposite increased gradually during recycling processes. Additionally, the microbial cell/Fe3O4 biocomposite could be easily separated and recycled by an external magnetic field due to the super-paramagnetic properties of Fe3O4 nanoparticle coating. These results indicated that magnetically modified microbial cells provide a promising technique for improving biocatalysts used in the biodegradation of hazardous compounds.",

A naturally developed microbial community in a pulp mill wastewater storage pool that had been disused were investigated in this study. Owing to natural evaporation and a huge amount of lignocellulose's deposition, the wastewater sediment contains high concentrations of organic matters and sodium ions, but low concentrations of chloride and carbonate. The microbiota inhabiting especially anaerobic community, including methanogenic arhcaea and cellulolytic species, was studied. All archaeal sequences fall into 2 clusters of family Halobacteriaceae and methanogenic archaeon in the phylum Euryarchaeota. In the methanogenic community, phylogenetic analysis of methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) genes targeted to novel species in genus Methanoculleus or novel genus of order Methanomicrobiales. The predominance of Methanomicrobiales suggests that methanogenesis in this system might be driven by the hydrogenotrophic pathway. As the important primary fermenter for methane production, the cellulolytic community of enzyme GHF48 was found to be dominated by narrower breadth of novel clostridial cellulase genes. Novel anoxic functional members in such extreme sediment provide the possibility of enhancing the efficiency of anoxic treatment of saline and alkaline wastewaters, as well as benefiting to the biomass transformation and biofuel production processes.",

        "title": "Regulation of Glutarate Catabolism by GntR Family Regulator CsiR and LysR Family Regulator GcdR in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.",
        "abstract": "Glutarate, a metabolic intermediate in the catabolism of several amino acids and aromatic compounds, can be catabolized through both the glutarate hydroxylation pathway and the glutaryl-coenzyme A (glutaryl-CoA) dehydrogenation pathway in  KT2440. The elucidation of the regulatory mechanism could greatly aid in the design of biotechnological alternatives for glutarate production. In this study, it was found that a GntR family protein, CsiR, and a LysR family protein, GcdR, regulate the catabolism of glutarate by repressing the transcription of  and , two key genes in the glutarate hydroxylation pathway, and by activating the transcription of  and , two key genes in the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenation pathway, respectively. Our data suggest that CsiR and GcdR are independent and that there is no cross-regulation between the two pathways. l-2-Hydroxyglutarate (l-2-HG), a metabolic intermediate in the glutarate catabolism with various physiological functions, has never been elucidated in terms of its metabolic regulation. Here, we reveal that two molecules, glutarate and l-2-HG, act as effectors of CsiR and that  KT2440 uses CsiR to sense glutarate and l-2-HG and to utilize them effectively. This report broadens our understanding of the bacterial regulatory mechanisms of glutarate and l-2-HG catabolism and may help to identify regulators of l-2-HG catabolism in other species. Glutarate is an attractive dicarboxylate with various applications. Clarification of the regulatory mechanism of glutarate catabolism could help to block the glutarate catabolic pathways, thereby improving glutarate production through biotechnological routes. Glutarate is a toxic metabolite in humans, and its accumulation leads to a hereditary metabolic disorder, glutaric aciduria type I. The elucidation of the functions of CsiR and GcdR as regulators that respond to glutarate could help in the design of glutarate biosensors for the rapid detection of glutarate in patients with glutaric aciduria type I. In addition, CsiR was identified as a regulator that also regulates l-2-HG metabolism. The identification of CsiR as a regulator that responds to l-2-HG could help in the discovery and investigation of other regulatory proteins involved in l-2-HG catabolism.",

This bacterium could selectively remove sulfur from dibenzothiophene (DBT) via the \"4S\" pathway. DBT, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sodium sulphate and mixed sulfur sources were used to study their influence on cell density, desulfurization activity, desulfurization ability, and the cost of biocatalyst production. In contrast to that observed from bacteria cultured in DBT, only partial desulfurization activity of strain 1awq was induced by DBT after cultivation in a medium containing inorganic sulfur as the sole sulfur source. The biocatalyst, prepared from culture with mixed sulfur sources, was found to possess desulfurization activity. With DMSO as the sole sulfur source, the desulfurization activity was shown to be similar to that of bacteria incubated in medium with DBT as the sole sulfur source. The biocatalyst prepared by this method with the least cost could remove sulfur from hydrodesulfurization (HDS)-treated diesel oil efficiently, providing a total desulfurization percent of 78% and suggesting its cost-effective advantage.",

About 30% of the sulfur content of FCC gasoline and 85% of sulfur in SR gasoline were reduced, respectively.

The surface localization of both OPH and MPH-GFP was demonstrated by cell fractionation, Western blot analysis, protease accessibility experiment, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Anchorage of the foreign proteins on the outer membrane neither inhibits cell growth nor affects cell viability. The recombinant strain can be used as a whole-cell biocatalyst and showed a broader substrate range than strains expressing either OPH or MPH. A mixture of six organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) (0.2 mM each) could be degraded completely within 5 h. The broader substrate specificity in combination with the rapid degradation rate makes the recombinant strain a promising candidate for detoxification of OPs. The fluorescence of surface-displayed GFP is very sensitive to environmental pH change. Because hydrolysis of OPs by OPH or MPH generates protons, the recombinant E. coli could be used as a whole-cell biosensor for the rapid detection of OPs by evaluating fluorescence changes as a function of OP concentrations.",

In this study, we demonstrated that NusA can self-assemble into oligomers under heat shock conditions and that this property is largely determined by the C-terminal domain. In parallel with the self-assembly process, NusA also acquires chaperone activity. Furthermore, NusA overexpression results in the enhanced heat shock resistance of host cells, which may be due to the chaperone activity of NusA. Our results suggest that E. coli NusA can act as a protector to prevent protein aggregation under heat stress conditions in vitro and in the NusA-overexpressing strain. We propose a new hypothesis that NusA could serve as a molecular chaperone in addition to its functions as a transcription factor. However, it remains to be further investigated whether NusA has the same function under normal physiological conditions.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptional factors that contain helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domains are widespread in bacteria for regulating gene expression on demand, and function as homodimers that bind a palindromic DNA segment. Here, we show that an HTH-containing transcriptional regulator, NicR2, in Pseudomonas putida\u2005S16 plays a critical role in controlling the expression of a crucial gene cluster (nic2) in nicotine degradation, and NicR2 binds DNA in a manner different from most other DNA-binding proteins that use HTHs for recognition. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting indicate that NicR2 directly interacts with a 28\u2009bp inverted repeat (IR) in the nic2 promoter region. Using EMSA with synthetic DNA fragments, we found that both NicR2 dimer and tetramer can bind to the half-site of the IR. This is confirmed independently by biolayer interferometry and cross-linking experiments. Our results indicate that two NicR2 dimers bind to the IR cooperatively through protein-protein interactions, with each dimer binding the half-site of the IR. Thus, NicR2 appears to be an unusual regulator, which uses HTH for recognition and displays the binding characteristics of some regulators that use \u03b2-sheets. The transcriptional regulation of nicotine degradation in Pseudomonas highlights a new level of complexity in prokaryotic transcriptional regulation.",

        "abstract": "In most halophiles, K generally acts as a major osmotic solute for osmotic adjustment and pH homeostasis. However, strains also need to extrude excessive intracellular K to avoid its toxicity. In the halotolerant and alkaliphilic Halomonas sp. Y2, an Na-induced K extrusion process was observed when the cells were confronted with high extracellular K pressure and supplementation by millimolar Na ions. Among three mechanosensitive channels (KefA) and two K/H antiporters founded in the genome of the strain, ke1 displayed around 3-5-fold upregulation to ion stress at pH 8.0, while much higher upregulation of Ha-mrp was observed at pH 10.0. Compared to the growth of wild-type Halomonas sp. Y2, deletion of these genes from the strain resulted in different growth phenotypes in response to the osmotic pressure of potassium. In combination with the transcriptional response of these genes, we proposed that the KefA channel of Ke1 is the main contributor to the K-extrusion process under weak alkalinity, while the Mrp system plays critical roles in alleviating K contents at high pH. The combination of these strategies allows Halomonas sp. Y2 to grow over a range of extracellular pH and ion concentrations, and thus protect cells under high osmotic stress conditions.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine is an important chemical compound in nature that has been regarded as an environmental toxicant causing various preventable diseases. Several bacterial species are adapted to decompose this heterocyclic compound, including Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter. Pseudomonas putida S16 is a bacterium that degrades nicotine through the pyrrolidine pathway, similar to that present in animals. The corresponding late steps of the nicotine degradation pathway in P. putida S16 was first proposed and demonstrated to be from 2,5-dihydroxy-pyridine through the intermediates N-formylmaleamic acid, maleamic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid. Genomics of strain S16 revealed that genes located in the largest genome island play a major role in nicotine degradation and may originate from other strains, as suggested by the constructed phylogenetic tree and the results of comparative genomic analysis. The deletion of gene hpo showed that this gene is essential for nicotine degradation. This study defines the mechanism of nicotine degradation.",

However, the fuel oils are toxic to microorganisms, which have seriously hindered the application of biodesulfurization. Here, a solvent-tolerant desulfurizing bacterium, Pseudomonas putida DS23, was developed using one of the organic solvent-responsive expression vectors newly constructed for biocatalysis, in which gene expression could be regulated in an organic solvent-dependent fashion. The biodesulfurizing activity of P. putida DS23 could be induced by all the organic solvents used. P. putida DS23 cells induced by n-hexane were able to degrade 56% of 0.5 mM DBT in 12 h in the biphasic reaction containing 33.3% (v/v) n-hexane, while the strain induced by isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside could only degrade 26% of 0.5 mM DBT. These results suggested that use of the constructed organic solvent-responsive expression vectors can facilitate the biphasic biocatalysis involving organic solvents.",

Prominent for its resilient mutagenicity and toxicity, DBF poses a major challenge to human health. In the present study, a new strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, FA-HZ1, with high DBF-degrading activity was isolated and identified. The determined optimum conditions for cell growth of strain FA-HZ1 were a temperature of 30\u202f\u00b0C, pH 5.0, rotation rate of 200\u202frpm and 0.1\u202fmM DBF as a carbon source. The biochemical and physiological features as well as usage of different carbon sources by FA-HZ1 were studied. The new strain was positive for arginine double hydrolase, gelatinase and citric acid, while it was negative for urease and lysine decarboxylase. It could utilize citric acid as its sole carbon source, but was negative for indole and HS production. Intermediates of DBF 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzofuran, 1,2-dihydroxydibenzofuran, 2-hydroxy-4-(3'-oxo-3'H-benzofuran-2'-yliden)but-2-enoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzofuran, 2-oxo-2-(2'-hydrophenyl)lactic acid, and 2-hydroxy-2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid were detected and identified through liquid chromatography-mass analyses. FA-HZ1 metabolizes DBF by both the angular and lateral dioxygenation pathways. The genomic study identified 158 genes that were involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds. To identify the key genes responsible for DBF degradation, a proteomic study was performed. A total of 1459 proteins were identified in strain FA-HZ1, of which 100 were up-regulated and 104 were down-regulated. A novel enzyme \"HZ6359 dioxygenase\", was amplified and expressed in pET-28a in E.\u00a0coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant plasmid was successfully constructed, and was used for further experiments to verify its function. In addition, the strain FA-HZ1 can also degrade halogenated analogues such as 2, 8-dibromo dibenzofuran and 4-(4-bromophenyl) dibenzofuran. Undoubtedly, the isolation and characterization of new strain and the designed pathways is significant, as it could lead to the development of cost-effective and alternative remediation strategies. The degradation pathway of DBF by P.\u00a0aeruginosa FA-HZ1 is a promising tool of biotechnological and environmental significance.",

Microbial cells are fast growing, easy to be cultivated in large scale, clear in genetic background and convenient in genetic modification. They play an important role in many domains. Microbial cell factory means an artificial microbial metabolic system that can be used in chemical production. The construction of a microbial cell factory needs transferring of multiple genes or a whole metabolic pathway, which may cause some problems such as metabolism imbalance and accumulation of mesostates. This review focuses on the regulation strategies of different levels involving simultaneous engagement of multiple genes. Future perspectives on the development of this domain were also discussed.",

Various enzymes with different molecular sizes were successfully tethered onto NPG, and the loadings were 3.6, 3.1 and 0.8 mg g(-1) for lipase, catalase and horseradish peroxidase, respectively. The enzyme-NPG biocomposites exhibited remarkable catalytic activities which were fully comparable to those of free enzymes. They also presented enhanced stability, with 74, 78 and 53% of enzymatic activity retained after 20 successive batch reactions. Moreover, these novel biocomposites possessed significantly enhanced reaction durability under various thermal and in organic solvent systems. In a sample transesterification reaction, a high conversion rate was readily achieved by using the lipase-NPG biocomposite.These nano-biocomposite materials hold great potential in applications such as biosensing, molecular electronics, catalysis, and controlled delivery.",

Culture medium optimization studies showed that soytone, an enzyme-hydrolysate of soybean meal, with the supplementation of vitamins, can fully replace yeast extract plus peptone in supporting TTMP production from glucose. In a 5-l fermenter, using the optimized medium which contained 20% glucose, 5% soytone, 3% (NH4)2HPO4, and vitamin supplements, fermentations were carried out with stirring at 700 rpm, air flow at 1.0 vvm, controlled pH at 7.0, and temperature at 37\u00b0C. TTMP reached 4.33 g l-1 after 64.6 h cultivation. A product recovery method was described, which involved evaporation, crystallization, and lyophilization. The product purity was 99.88%, determined by GC with the normalization method. The main impurities were 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine (0.09%) and 2-ethyl-3,5,6- trimethylpyrazine (0.02%), which were identified by GC/MS. 13C NMR determination also gave a consistent result. Natural and high purity of the product and the utilization of cheap green renewable materials make this process promising to compete with TTMP chemical synthetic methods. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2006.",

        "abstract": "Bioethanol production from various starchy materials has received much attention in recent years. \u03b1-Amylases are key enzymes in the bioconversion process of starchy biomass to biofuels, food or other products. The properties of thermostability, pH stability, and Ca-independency are important in the development of such fermentation process.A novel Flavobacteriaceae Sinomicrobium \u03b1-amylase (FSA) was identified and characterized from genomic analysis of a novel Flavobacteriaceae species. It is closely related with archaeal \u03b1-amylases in the GH13_7 subfamily, but is evolutionary distant with other bacterial \u03b1-amylases. Based on the conserved sequence alignment and homology modeling, with minor variation, the Zn2+- and Ca2+-binding sites of FSA were predicated to be the same as those of the archaeal thermophilic \u03b1-amylases. The recombinant \u03b1-amylase was highly expressed and biochemically characterized. It showed optimum activity at pH 6.0, high enzyme stability at pH 6.0 to 11.0, but weak thermostability. A disulfide bond was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in domain C and resulted in the apparent improvement of the enzyme activity at high temperature and broad pH range. Moreover, about 50% of the enzyme activity was detected under 100\u00b0C condition, whereas no activity was observed for the wild type enzyme. Its thermostability was also enhanced to some extent, with the half-life time increasing from 25 to 55 minutes at 50\u00b0C. In addition, after the introduction of the disulfide bond, the protein became a Ca-independent enzyme.The improved stability of FSA suggested that the domain C contributes to the overall stability of the enzyme under extreme conditions. In addition, successfully directed modification and special evolutionary status of FSA imply its directional reconstruction potentials for bioethanol production, as well as for other industrial applications.",

In the present study, corncob molasses was used to produce 2,3-butanediol (BD) using Klebsiella pneumoniae SDM. This was the first report on the use of corncob molasses to produce bulk chemicals. Our results indicated that K. pneumoniae SDM can utilize various sugars contained in the corncob molasses in a preferential manner: glucose > arabinose > xylose. It was shown that high sugars concentration had an inhibitory effect on the cells growth and BD production. The maximum concentration of BD was 78.9 g/l after 61 h of fed-batch fermentation, giving a BD productivity of 1.3 g/l h and a yield of 81.4%. The present study suggests that the low-cost corncob molasses could be used as an alternative substrate for the production of BD by K. pneumoniae SDM, as well as a potential carbon source for production of other high-value chemicals.",

Steepest ascent experiments were applied to approach the optimal region of the two factors and a central composite design was employed to determine their optimal levels. The optimal medium was used to perform fed-batch fermentations with K. pneumoniae SDM. BD production was then studied in a 5-l bioreactor applying different fed-batch strategies, including pulse fed batch, constant feed rate fed batch, constant residual glucose concentration fed batch, and exponential fed batch. The maximum BD concentration of 150 g/l at 38 h with a diol productivity of 4.21 g/l h was obtained by the constant residual glucose concentration feeding strategy.

        "abstract": "2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD), a platform and fuel bio-chemical, can be efficiently produced by Klebsiella pneumonia, K. oxytoca, and Serratia marcescens. However, these strains are opportunistic pathogens and not favorable for industrial application. Although some generally regarded as safe (GRAS) microorganisms have been isolated in recent years, there is still a demand for safe 2,3-BD producing strains with high productivity and yield under thermophilic fermentation.Bacillus licheniformis strain 10-1-A was newly isolated for 2,3-BD production. The optimum temperature and medium pH were 50\u00b0C and pH 7.0 for 2,3-BD production by strain 10-1-A. The medium composition was optimized through Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology techniques. With a two-stage agitation speed control strategy, 115.7 g/L of 2,3-BD was obtained from glucose by fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor with a high productivity (2.4 g/L\u00b7h) and yield (94% of its theoretical value). The 2,3-BD produced by strain 10-1-A comprises (2R,3R)-2,3-BD and meso-2,3-BD with a ratio of nearly 1:1. The bdh and gdh genes encoding meso-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (meso-BDH) and glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) of strain 10-1-A were expressed in Escherichia coli and the proteins were purified. meso-2,3-BD and (2R,3R)-2,3-BD were transformed from racemic acetoin by meso-BDH and GDH with NADH, respectively.Compared with the reported GRAS 2,3-BD producers, B. licheniformis 10-1-A could thermophilically produce 2,3-BD with a high concentration, productivity and yield. Thus, the newly isolated GRAS strain 10-1-A might be a promising strain for industrial production of 2,3-BD. Two key enzymes for meso-2,3-BD and (2R,3R)-2,3-BD production were purified and further studied, and this might be helpful to understand the mechanism for 2,3-BD stereoisomers forming in B. licheniformis.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine is an environmental toxicant in tobacco waste, imposing a serious hazard for human health. Some bacteria including Pseudomonas spp. strains are able to metabolize nicotine to non-toxic compounds. The pyrrolidine pathway of nicotine degradation in Pseudomonas putida S16 has recently been revealed. The maleate isomerase (Pp-Iso) catalyses the last step in nicotine degradation of P.\u2009putida S16, the cis-trans isomerization of maleate to fumarate. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of both wild type isomerase by itself and its C200A point mutant in complex with its substrate maleate, to resolutions of 2.95\u2009\u00c5 and 2.10\u2009\u00c5 respectively. Our structures reveal that Asn17 and Asn169 play critical roles in recognizing the maleate by site-directed mutants' analysis. Surprisingly, our structure shows that the maleate is completely wrapped inside the isomerase. Examination of the structure prompted us to hypothesize that the \u03b22-\u03b12 loop and the \u03b26-\u03b17 loop have a breathing motion that regulates substrate/solvent entry and product departure. Our results of molecular dynamics simulation and enzymatic activity assay are fully consistent with this hypothesis. The isomerase probably uses this breathing motion to prevent the solvent from entering the active site and prohibit unproductive side reactions from happening.",

A powerful catalyst was developed by packaging the enzymes in an engineered bacterium and using a safe temperature-induced vector. Since the mass transfer resistance and the side reactions were substantially reduced, a high Neu5Ac amount (191 mM) was achieved. An efficient method was also presented, which allows one-pot synthesis of Neu5Ac with a safe and economic manner.

        "abstract": "Acetamiprid is a chloropyridinyl neonicotinoid that is widely used in agricultural areas, but its contribution to environmental pollution has resulted in its restriction in many countries. Little information is known about whether bacteria can hydrolyze acetamiprid. A bacterial strain that could hydrolyze acetamiprid was newly isolated using enrichment culture techniques. The morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic analysis characterized the isolate as Stenotrophomonas sp. The maximum growth and acetamiprid-degrading ability of the bacterium were observed at 30 \u00b0C at pH 7.0, in mineral medium supplemented with 1 g l-1 acetamiprid. A possibly important metabolite, N-methyl-(6-chloro-3-pyridyl)-methylamine (ACE-3), was identified based on nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. This paper demonstrates for the first time that a pure bacterium is able to hydrolyze acetamiprid by targeting the magic nitro or cyano substituent groups of the compound. The end product ACE-3 is known to be less toxic to mammals and bees. The hydrolytic mechanism is similar to the metabolic conversion of the compound in mammals and insects.

        "abstract": "N-heterocyclic compounds from industrial wastes, including nicotine, are environmental pollutants or toxicants responsible for a variety of health problems. Microbial biodegradation is an attractive strategy for the removal of N-heterocyclic pollutants, during which carbon-nitrogen bonds in N-heterocycles are converted to amide bonds and subsequently severed by amide hydrolases. Previous studies have failed to clarify the molecular mechanism through which amide hydrolases selectively recognize diverse amide substrates and complete the biodenitrogenation process. In this study, structural, computational and enzymatic analyses showed how the N-formylmaleamate deformylase Nfo and the maleamate amidase Ami, two pivotal amide hydrolases in the nicotine catabolic pathway of Pseudomonas putida S16, specifically recognize their respective substrates. In addition, comparison of the \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b1 groups of amidases, which include Ami, pinpointed several subgroup-characteristic residues differentiating the two classes of amide substrates as containing either carboxylate groups or aromatic rings. Furthermore, this study reveals the molecular mechanism through which the specially tailored active sites of deformylases and amidases selectively recognize their unique substrates. Our work thus provides a thorough elucidation of the molecular mechanism through which amide hydrolases accomplish substrate-specific recognition in the microbial N-heterocycles biodenitrogenation pathway.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine, the main alkaloid produced by Nicotiana tabacum and other Solanaceae, is very toxic and may be a leading toxicant causing preventable disease and death, with the rise in global tobacco consumption. Several different microbial pathways of nicotine metabolism have been reported: Arthrobacter uses the pyridine pathway, and Pseudomonas, like mammals, uses the pyrrolidine pathway. We identified and characterized a novel 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP) hydroxylase (HspB) using enzyme purification, peptide sequencing, and sequencing of the Pseudomonas putida S16 genome. The HSP hydroxylase has no known orthologs and converts HSP to 2,5-dihydroxy-pyridine and succinic semialdehyde, using NADH. (18)O(2) labeling experiments provided direct evidence for the incorporation of oxygen from O(2) into 2,5-dihydroxy-pyridine. The hspB gene deletion showed that this enzyme is essential for nicotine degradation, and site-directed mutagenesis identified an FAD-binding domain. This study demonstrates the importance of the newly discovered enzyme HspB, which is crucial for nicotine degradation by the Pseudomonas strain.",

        "abstract": "Optically pure d-lactate production has received much attention for its critical role in high-performance polylactic acid production. However, the current technology can hardly meet the comprehensive demand of industrialization on final titer, productivity, optical purity, and raw material costs. Here, an efficient d-lactate producer strain, Sporolactobacillus terrae HKM-1, was isolated for d-lactate production. Strain HKM-1 shows extremely high d-lactate fermentative capability by using peanut meal, soybean meal or corn steep liquor powder as a sole nitrogen source; the final titers (205.7 g/L, 218.9 g/L and 193.9 g/L, respectively) and productivities (5.56 g/(L\u00b7h), 5.34 g/(L\u00b7h) and 3.73 g/(L\u00b7h), respectively) of d-lactate reached the highest level ever reported. Comparative genomic analysis between S. terrae HKM-1 and previously reported d-lactate high producing S. inulinus CASD was conducted. The results show that many unrelated genetic features may contribute to the superior performance in d-lactate production of S. terrae HKM-1. This d-lactate producer HKM-1 along with its fermentation process is promising for sustainable d-lactate production by using agro-industrial wastes. This article is protected by copyright.

Three hypotheses were formerly discussed for conversion of 2,5-DHP to maleamate. Based on enzymatic reactions of dioxygenase (Hpo) and N-formylamide deformylase (Nfo), we demonstrated that the dioxygenase does not catalyze the hydrolysis of NFM but rather that this activity is brought about by a separate deformylase. We report that the deformylase acts both on NFM and its trans-isomer, N-formylfumaramic acid (NFF), but the catalytic efficiency of Nfo for NFM is about 1,400 times greater than that for NFF. In addition, we uncover catalytic and structural characteristics of the new family that the Hpo belongs to, and support a potential 2-His-1-carboxylate motif (HX52HXD) by three-dimensional modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. This study provides a better understanding of 2,5-DHP catabolism.",

Under optimal conditions, Neu5Ac at a high concentration (54.7 g liter\u207b\u00b9) and a high yield (90.2%) was obtained under a 5-fold excess of pyruvate over N-acetyl-D-mannosamine. The novel biocatalyst system, which is able to express and immobilize the target enzyme simultaneously on the surface of B. subtilis spores, represents a suitable alternative for value-added chemical production.",

In this study, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with lipase-nanoporous gold (NPG) biocomposite (denoted as lipase/NPG/GCE). Due to highly conductive, porous, and biocompatible three-dimensional structure, NPG is suitable for enzyme immobilization. In cyclic voltammetry experiments, the lipase/NPG/GCE bioelectrode displayed surface-confined reaction in a phosphate buffer solution. Linear responses were obtained for tributyrin concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 mg dl(-1) and olive oil concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 mg dl(-1). The value of apparent Michaelis-Menten constant for tributyrin was 10.67 mg dl(-1) and the detection limit was 2.68 mg dl(-1). Further, the lipase/NPG/GCE bioelectrode had strong anti-interference ability against urea, glucose, cholesterol, and uric acid as well as a long shelf-life. For the detection of triglycerides in human serum, the values given by the lipase/NPG/GCE bioelectrode were in good agreement with those of an automatic biochemical analyzer. These properties along with a long self-life make the lipase/NPG/GCE bioelectrode an excellent choice for the construction of triglycerides biosensor.",

The strain was identified as Bacillus subtilis according to its 16S rDNA sequence analysis and biochemical characteristics. The metabolic pathway for the degradation of isoeugenol was examined. Isoeugenol-diol, for the first time, was detected as an intermediate from isoeugenol to vanillin by a bacterial strain. Isoeugenol was converted to vanillin via isoeugenol-diol, and vanillin was then metabolized via vanillic acid to guaiacol by strain HS8. These metabolites, vanillin, vanillic acid, and guaiacol, are all valuable aromatic compounds in flavor production. At the same time, the bipolymerization of isoeugenol was observed, which produced dehydrodiisoeugenol and decreased the vanillin yield. High level of vanillic acid decarboxylase activity was detected in cell-free extract. These findings provided a detailed profile of isoeugenol metabolism by a B. subtilis strain for the first time, which would improve the production of valuable aromatic compounds by biotechnology.",

        "abstract": "Wheat bran, a by-product of the wheat milling industry, consists mainly of hemicellulose, starch and protein. In this study,\n the hydrolysate of wheat bran pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid was used as a substrate to produce ABE (acetone, butanol\n and ethanol) using Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC 55025. The wheat bran hydrolysate contained 53.1\u00a0g/l total reducing sugars, including 21.3\u00a0g/l of glucose, 17.4\u00a0g/l\n of xylose and 10.6\u00a0g/l of arabinose. C. beijerinckii ATCC 55025 can utilize hexose and pentose simultaneously in the hydrolysate to produce ABE. After 72\u00a0h of fermentation, the\n total ABE in the system was 11.8\u00a0g/l, of which acetone, butanol and ethanol were 2.2, 8.8 and 0.8\u00a0g/l, respectively. The fermentation\n resulted in an ABE yield of 0.32 and productivity of 0.16\u00a0g\u00a0l\u22121\u00a0h\u22121. This study suggests that wheat bran can be a potential renewable resource for ABE fermentation.",

It is crucial to find an efficient sugar-utilizing strain and feasible carbon source for the economical production of BD.Efficient BD production by a newly isolated Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens SDM was studied using crop-biomass cassava powder as substrate. The culture conditions and fermentation medium for BD production were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, 78.3 g l(-1) of BD was produced after 24 h in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), with a yield of 0.42 g BD g(-1) cassava powder and a specific productivity of 3.3 g l(-1) h(-1). A higher BD concentration (93.9 g l(-1)) was produced after 47 h in fed-batch SSF.The results suggest that strain SDM is a good candidate for the BD production, and cassava powder could be used as an alternative substrate for the efficient production of BD.",

Two recombinant Escherichia coli strains capable of expressing N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase and N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid aldolase were constructed based on a highly efficient temperature-responsive expression system which is safe\n compared to chemical-induced systems and coupled in Neu5Ac production. Carbon sources were optimized for Neu5Ac production,\n and the concentration effects of carbon sources on the production were investigated. With 2,200\u00a0mM pyruvate as carbon source\n and substrate, 61.9\u00a0mM (19.1\u00a0g\u00a0l\u22121) Neu5Ac was produced from 200\u00a0mM N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) in 36\u00a0h by the coupled cells.

        "abstract": "Microorganisms such as Pseudomonas putida play important roles in the mineralization of organic wastes and toxic compounds. To comprehensively and accurately elucidate key processes of nicotine degradation in Pseudomonas putida, we measured differential protein abundance levels with MS-based spectral counting in P. putida S16 grown on nicotine or glycerol, a non-repressive carbon source. In silico analyses highlighted significant clustering of proteins involved in a functional pathway in nicotine degradation. The transcriptional regulation of differentially expressed genes was analyzed by using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We observed the following key results: (i) The proteomes, containing 1,292 observed proteins, provide a detailed view of enzymes involved in nicotine metabolism. These proteins could be assigned to the functional groups of transport, detoxification, and amino acid metabolism. There were significant differences in the cytosolic protein patterns of cells growing in a nicotine medium and those in a glycerol medium. (ii) The key step in the conversion of 3-succinoylpyridine to 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine was catalyzed by a multi-enzyme reaction consisting of a molybdopeterin binding oxidase (spmA), molybdopterin dehydrogenase (spmB), and a (2Fe-2S)-binding ferredoxin (spmC) with molybdenum molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide as a cofactor. (iii) The gene of a novel nicotine oxidoreductase (nicA2) was cloned, and the recombinant protein was characterized. The proteins and functional pathway identified in the current study represent attractive targets for degradation of environmental toxic compounds.",

When the ammonium source was changed from (NH(4))(2)SO(4) to (NH(4))(2)HPO(4), only about one tenth of TMI was detected. Although the mechanistic events largely remain unclear, both microbial strains tested demonstrated similar dynamic processes of TMI production, suggesting that TMI formation is a genuine feature of Bacillus species.",

Although NAD(P)H regeneration systems have been widely studied, NAD(P)(+) regeneration, which is required in reactions where the oxidized form of the cofactor is used, has been less well explored, particularly in whole-cell biocatalytic processes.Simultaneous overexpression of an NAD(+) dependent enzyme and an NAD(+) regenerating enzyme (H(2)O producing NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis) in a whole-cell biocatalyst was studied for application in the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation system. The whole-cell biocatalyst with (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase as the catalyzing enzyme was used to produce (3R)-acetoin, (3S)-acetoin and (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol.A recombinant strain, in which an NAD(+) regeneration enzyme was coexpressed, displayed significantly higher biocatalytic efficiency in terms of the production of chiral acetoin and (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol. The application of this coexpression system to the production of other chiral chemicals could be extended by using different NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases that require NAD(P)(+) for catalysis.",

The coding genes of the two proteins in L. rhamnosus CASL, ldhD1 and ldhD2, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta with an inducible expression vector pETDuet\u2122-1 (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. The two purified proteins,\n LdhD-1 and LdhD-2, migrated as a single protein band separately, both corresponding to an apparent molecular mass between\n 35\u00a0kDa and 45\u00a0kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activities of LdhD-1 and LdhD-2\n catalyzing pyruvate to LA were 0.02\u00a0U/mg and 0.21\u00a0U/mg, respectively. The configuration of LA converted from pyruvate was\n determined using high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a chiral column. Only D-LA was detected when LdhD-1\n and LdhD-2 were tested. In summary, the two proteins cloned and expressed in this study were most probably responsible for\n D-LA formation during fermentation of L. rhamnosus CASL.",

Two recombinant Escherichia coli strains capable of expressing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase and N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid aldolase were constructed based on a highly efficient temperature-responsive expression system which is safe compared to chemical-induced systems and coupled in Neu5Ac production. Carbon sources were optimized for Neu5Ac production, and the concentration effects of carbon sources on the production were investigated. With 2,200 mM pyruvate as carbon source and substrate, 61.9 mM (19.1 g l(-1)) Neu5Ac was produced from 200 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) in 36 h by the coupled cells.

        "abstract": "Benzothiophenes are a toxic and relatively recalcitrant fraction of coal-tar creosote. We investigated the co-metabolic transformation of benzothiophene (BT) and its derivatives by the carbazole (CA) degrader Sphingomonas sp. XLDN2-5, which is not able to grow on benzothiophenes as the sole carbon source. Among the benzothiophenes tested, BT, 2-methylbenzothiophene (2-MBT) and 5-methylbenzothiophene (5-MBT) were co-metabolically converted. For 3-methylbenzothiophene, there was complete inhibition of growth on CA. The common transformation products for BT, 2-MBT and 5-MBT are the corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones. For BT, several high-molecular-mass sulfur-containing aromatic compounds, including benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene-7-oxide, 6a,11b-dihydrobenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, 6a,11b-dihydrobenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene-7-oxide, and a new product, 6,12-epithiobenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, were detected by GC-MS. These high-molecular-mass products are thought to be generated from a Diels-Alder-type reaction. Investigations with a combination of GC and flame ionization detection showed that about 17 % of BT was transformed to benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene. Aerobic transformation of benzothiophenes to sulfoxides and sulfones can reduce their toxicity, and facilitate their biodegradation. However, the formation of the high-molecular-mass products, such as benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]thiophene, should be considered in the biodegradation of benzothiophenes.",

The product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), N2 absorption-desorption, and thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), respectively. The surface electrical properties and magnetic properties of the Fe3O4 magnetic nanocrystals were systematically investigated. The growth mechanism of the Fe3O4 magnetic nanocrystals was discussed. The results show that the Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles obtained are well-crystallized particles, with an average size of 10 nm, which have good dispersivity. The specific surface area of particles can reach as much as 91.6 m2 \u00b7 g-1. The obtained nanoparticles also have good thermostability, and the isoelectric point (IEP) under water conditions is at pHpzc=5.7. Magnetic measurement reveals the magnetic nanoparticles are superparamagnetic with a saturation magnetization of 65.0 emu \u00b7 g-1. The ultrasonic enhancement and the surfactant modification play an important role in the growth mechanism of the Fe3O4 superparamagnetic nanocrystals. These superparamagnetic nanocrystals might be applied to biological and medical fields such as cell or enzyme immobilization.",

In this study, polypropylene glycol 1500 (PPG 1500) was firstly used as an extractant in the extractive bioconversion of L-phenylalanine by strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae P-3. About 4.8 g L-1 2-phenylethanol was obtained from 7 g L-1 L-phenylalanine in flask experiment within 36 h, with a high molar yield of 92.7 %. Compared to conventional bioconversion without addition of extractant, the yield was improved by 26.3 %. In a fed-batch extractive bioconversion, the highest concentration of 2-phenylethanol in the organic phase exceeded 22 g L-1 and the total concentration in both aqueous and organic phases reached 7.5 g L-1. The results showed that the process with polypropylene glycol 1500 as an extractant might have the potential in bioproduction of 2-phenylethanol.",

Neu5Ac (98.4 \u00b1 0.4% purity, 80.87 \u00b1 0.79% recovery yield) was purified by anionic exchange chromatography.

Microbial consortia are promising for diverse bioenergy and environmental applications, yet microbial interactions are not fully understood. Here, we present comprehensive investigation on how two species in an artificial microbial consortium, consisting of  A1 and  B1, mutually cooperate to achieve an overall enhancement in hydrogen production and starch utilization. In this consortium, strains A1 and B1 secrete \u03b1-amylase and glucoamylase that are functionally complementary in starch hydrolysis. Moreover, strain A1 converts starch into lactate as a carbon source and electron donor, supporting the cell growth and hydrogen generation of strain B1. In return, strain B1 produces formate as an electron shuttle to strain A1 to enhance hydrogen production. The co-culture re-directs the overall metabolic flux, facilitates the cell growth, and up-regulates the key genes of hydrogen production and starch hydrolysis.",

BphLA-4 was independently transcribed by the two operons, bphA1A2orf1A3A4BCX0 and bphX1orf2X2X3D, and significantly differed from bphKF707. Both benzoate and catechol induced the expression of both operons. 2-Hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate was identified as the intermediate of the biphenyl degradation by strain LA-4.

In this work, the NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase was expressed and purified. Glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis 168 was coupled with the NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase to produce (3S)-AC from DA. Under the optimal conditions, 12.2 g l(-1) (3S)-AC was produced from 14.3 g l(-1) DA in 75 min. Because DA can be biotechnological produced, the two-enzymes coupling system might be a promising alternative for the (3S)-AC production.",

High L-lactic acid concentration (81.0 g L(-1)) was obtained from 162.5 g L(-1) concentrated corn stover hydrolyzate (total reducing sugar of 83.0 g L(-1)) with a volumetric productivity of 1.86 g L(-1) h(-1) (0-36 h) and a product yield of 0.98 g g(-1) total reducing sugars. This is the highest L-lactic acid concentration and yield reported from corn stover hydrolyzate. And the high optical purity of L-lactic acid obtained in this study also indicated that Bacillus sp.

        "abstract": "2,3-Butanediol is a platform and fuel biochemical that can be efficiently produced from biomass. However, a value-added process for this chemical has not yet been developed. To expand the utilization of 2,3-butanediol produced from biomass, an improved derivative process of 2,3-butanediol is desirable.In this study, a Gluconobacter oxydans strain DSM 2003 was found to have the ability to transform 2,3-butanediol into acetoin, a high value feedstock that can be widely used in dairy and cosmetic products, and chemical synthesis. All three stereoisomers, meso-2,3-butanediol, (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol, and (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol, could be transformed into acetoin by the strain. After optimization of the bioconversion conditions, the optimum growth temperature for acetoin production by strain DSM 2003 was found to be 30\u00b0C and the medium pH was 6.0. With an initial 2,3-butanediol concentration of 40 g/L, acetoin at a high concentration of 89.2 g/L was obtained from 2,3-butanediol by fed-batch bioconversion with a high productivity (1.24 g/L\u2009\u00b7\u2009h) and high yield (0.912 mol/mol).G. oxydans DSM 2003 is the first strain that can be used in the direct production of acetoin from 2,3-butanediol. The product concentration and yield of the novel process are both new records for acetoin production. The results demonstrate that the method developed in this study could provide a promising process for efficient acetoin production and industrially produced 2,3-butanediol utilization.",

        "abstract": "NAD-independent L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-iLDH) from Pseudomonas stutzeri SDM can potentially be used for the kinetic resolution of small aliphatic 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids. However, this enzyme showed rather low activity towards aromatic 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids.Val-108 of L-iLDH was changed to Ala by rationally site-directed mutagenesis. The L-iLDH mutant exhibited much higher activity than wide-type L-iLDH towards L-mandelate, an aromatic 2-hydroxycarboxylic acid. Using the engineered Escherichia coli expressing the mutant L-iLDH as a biocatalyst, 40 g\u00b7L(-1) of DL-mandelic acid was converted to 20.1 g\u00b7L(-1) of D-mandelic acid (enantiomeric purity higher than 99.5%) and 19.3 g\u00b7L(-1) of benzoylformic acid.A new biocatalyst with high catalytic efficiency toward an unnatural substrate was constructed by rationally re-design mutagenesis. Two building block intermediates (optically pure D-mandelic acid and benzoylformic acid) were efficiently produced by the one-pot biotransformation system.",

Due to the toxicity of vanillin and the product inhibition, fed-batch biotransformation with high concentration of ferulic acid was unsuccessful. To solve this problem and improve the vanillin yield, a biotransformation strategy using adsorbent resin was investigated. Several macroporous adsorbent resins were chosen to adsorb vanillin in situ during the bioconversion. Resin DM11 was found to be the best, which adsorbed the most vanillin and the least ferulic acid. When 8% resin DM11 (wet w/v) was added to the biotransformation system, 45 g l(-1) ferulic acid could be added continually and 19.2 g l(-1) vanillin was obtained within 55 h, which was the highest vanillin yield by bioconversion until now. This yield was remarkable for exceeding the crystallization concentration of vanillin and therefore had far-reaching consequence in its downstream processing.",

However, the concentration and productivity of PLA have been low in previous studies. The enzymes responsible for conversion of phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) into PLA are equivocal.A novel thermophilic strain, Bacillus coagulans SDM, was isolated for production of PLA. When the solubility and dissolution rate of PPA were enhanced at a high temperature, whole cells of B. coagulans SDM could effectively convert PPA into PLA at a high concentration (37.3 g l(-1)) and high productivity (2.3 g l(-1) h(-1)) under optimal conditions. Enzyme activity staining and kinetic studies identified NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenases as the key enzymes that reduced PPA to PLA.Taking advantage of the thermophilic character of B. coagulans SDM, a high yield and productivity of PLA were obtained. The enzymes involved in PLA production were identified and characterized, which makes possible the rational design and construction of microorganisms suitable for PLA production with metabolic engineering.",

        "abstract": "2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is an important aromatic alcohol with a rose-like fragrance. It has been widely applied in the cosmetic, perfume, and food industries and is mainly produced by chemical synthesis. An alternative method for the production of natural flavors and fragrances is the microbial transformation process, which is attracting increasing attention because it is an environmentally friendly process and the products are considered \"natural\". The production of 2-PE from L-phenylalanine by biotransformation is possible through the Ehrlich pathway and considerable progress has been made in the development of this process. The present report reviews recent advances in biotechnological production of 2-PE, with emphasis on the strategies used to increase production and the applications of in situ product removal techniques. Future research should focus on product scale-up and product recovery processes for the industrialization of microbial processes.",

        "abstract": "An optimization strategy based on desirability function approach (DFA) together with response surface methodology (RSM) has been used to optimize production medium in L-glutamine fermentation. Fermentation problems often force to reach a compromise between different experimental variables in order to achieve the most suitable strategy applying in industrial production. The importance of the use of multi-objective optimization methods lies in the ability to cope with this kind of problems. A sequential RSM with different combinations of glucose and (NH(4))(2)SO(4) was performed to attain the optimal medium (OM-1) in glutamine production. Based on the result of RSM and the evaluation of production cost, a more economical optimal medium (OM-2) was obtained with the aid of DFA. In DFA study, glutamate, the main by-product in glutamine fermentation as another response was considered. Compared with OM-1 in validated experiment, similar amounts of glutamine were obtained in OM-2 while the concentration of glutamate and the production cost decreased by 53.6 and 7.1%, respectively.",

It plays multiple roles in transcriptional elongation, and may be implicated in resistance to various stresses.In this study, we show that Escherichia coli GreA inhibits aggregation of several substrate proteins under heat shock condition. GreA can also effectively promote the refolding of denatured proteins. These facts reveal that GreA has chaperone activity. Distinct from many molecular chaperones, GreA does not form stable complexes with unfolded substrates. GreA overexpression confers the host cells with enhanced resistance to heat shock and oxidative stress. Moreover, GreA expression in the greA/greB double mutant could suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype, and dramatically alleviate the in vivo protein aggregation. The results suggest that bacterial GreA may act as chaperone in vivo.These results suggest that GreA, in addition to its function as a transcription factor, is involved in protection of cellular proteins against aggregation.",

In this study, a new species of Pseudomonas geniculata, namely strain N1, which is capable of efficiently degrading nicotine, was isolated and identified. The optimal growth conditions for strain N1 are a temperature of 30\u00b0C, and a pH 6.5, at a rotation rate of 120 rpm min(-1) with 1 g l(-1) nicotine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Myosmine, cotinine, 6-hydroxynicotine, 6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine, and 6-hydroxy-pseudooxynicotine were detected as the five intermediates through gas chromatography-mass and liquid chromatography-mass analyses. The identified metabolites were different from those generated by Pseudomonas putida strains. The analysis also highlighted the bacterial metabolic diversity in relation to nicotine degradation by different Pseudomonas strains.",

        "abstract": "Attempts were made with success to develop a two-step biocatalytic process for uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) production from orotic acid by Corynebacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6872: the strain was first cultivated in a high salt mineral medium, and then cells were harvested and used as the catalyst in the UMP production reaction. Effects of cultivation and reaction conditions on UMP production were investigated. The cells exhibited the highest biocatalytic ability when cultivated in a medium containing corn steep liquor at pH 7.0 for 15 h in the exponential phase of growth. To optimize the reaction, both \"one-factor-at-a-time\" method and statistical method were performed. By \"one-factor-at-a-time\" optimization, orotic acid, glucose, phosphate ion (equimolar KH(2)PO(4) and K(2)HPO(4)), MgCl(2), Triton X-100 were shown to be the optimum components for the biocatalytic reaction. Phosphate ion and C. ammoniagenes cell were furthermore demonstrated as the most important main effects on UMP production by Plackett-Burman design, indicating that 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthesis was the rate-limiting step for pyrimidine nucleotides production. Optimization by a central composition design (CCD) was then performed, and up to 32 mM (10.4 g l(-1)) UMP was accumulated in 24 h from 38.5 mM (6 g l(-1)) orotic acid. The yield was threefold higher than the original UMP yield before optimization.",

        "abstract": "Carbazole is a recalcitrant compound with a dioxin-like structure and possesses mutagenic and toxic activities. Bacteria respond to a xenobiotic by recruiting exogenous genes to establish a pathway to degrade the xenobiotic, which is necessary for their adaptation and survival. Usually, this process is mediated by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons, and insertion sequences.The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the degradation of carbazole to catechol via anthranilate were cloned, sequenced, and characterized from a carbazole-degrading Sphingomonas sp. strain XLDN2-5. The car gene cluster (carRAaBaBbCAc) and fdr gene were accompanied on both sides by two copies of IS6100 elements, and organized as IS6100::ISSsp1-ORF1-carRAaBaBbCAc-ORF8-IS6100-fdr-IS6100. Carbazole was converted by carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase (CARDO, CarAaAcFdr), meta-cleavage enzyme (CarBaBb), and hydrolase (CarC) to anthranilate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate. The fdr gene encoded a novel ferredoxin reductase whose absence resulted in lower transformation activity of carbazole by CarAa and CarAc. The ant gene cluster (antRAcAdAbAa) which was involved in the conversion of anthranilate to catechol was also sandwiched between two IS6100 elements as IS6100-antRAcAdAbAa-IS6100. Anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase (ANTDO) was composed of a reductase (AntAa), a ferredoxin (AntAb), and a two-subunit terminal oxygenase (AntAcAd). Reverse transcription-PCR results suggested that carAaBaBbCAc gene cluster, fdr, and antRAcAdAbAa gene cluster were induced when strain XLDN2-5 was exposed to carbazole. Expression of both CARDO and ANTDO in Escherichia coli required the presence of the natural reductases for full enzymatic activity.We predict that IS6100 might play an important role in the establishment of carbazole-degrading pathway, which endows the host to adapt to novel compounds in the environment. The organization of the car and ant genes in strain XLDN2-5 was unique, which showed strong evolutionary trail of gene recruitment mediated by IS6100 and presented a remarkable example of rearrangements and pathway establishments.",

        "abstract": ",-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is one of the most common xenobiotic chemicals and can be easily emitted into the environment, where it causes harm to human beings. Herein, an efficient DMF-degrading strain DM1 was isolated and identified as  sp. This strain can use DMF as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Whole genome sequencing of strain DM1 reveals that it has a 5.66 Mbp chromosome and a 200 kbp mega-plasmid. The plasmid pLVM1 specifically harbors the genes essential for the initial steps of DMF degradation, and the chromosome carries the genes facilitating subsequent methylotrophic metabolism. By analyzing the transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data, the complete mineralization pathway and redundant gene clusters of DMF degradation were elucidated. The dimethylformidase (DMFase) gene was heterologously expressed, and DMFase was purified and characterized. Plasmid pLVM1 is catabolically crucial for the DMF utilization, as evidenced by the phenotype identification of the plasmid-free strain. Taken together, this study systematically unravels the molecular mechanism of DMF degradation by   ,-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is a hazardous pollutant that has been used in the chemical industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and agriculture. Biodegradation as a method for removing DMF has received increasing attention. Here, we identified an efficient DMF degrader,  sp. DM1, and characterized the complete DMF mineralization pathway and enzymatic properties of DMFase in this strain. This study provides insights in the molecular mechanism and evolutionary advantage of DMF degradation facilitated by plasmid pLVM1 and redundant genes in strain DM1, suggesting emergence of new ecotypes of .",

        "abstract": "Lipases are one of the most important biocatalysts for biotechnological applications. Immobilization is an efficient method to increase the stability and reusability of lipases. In this study, nanoporous gold (NPG), a new kind of nanoporous material with tunable porosity and excellent biocompatibility, was employed as an effective support for lipase immobilization. The pore size of NPG and adsorption time played key roles in the construction of lipase-NPG biocomposites. The morphology and composition of NPG before and after lipase loading are verified using a scanning electron microscope, equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The resulting lipase-NPG biocomposites exhibited excellent catalytic activity and remarkable reusability. The catalytic activity of the lipase-NPG biocomposite with a pore size of 35 nm had no decrease after ten recycles. Besides, the lipase-NPG biocomposite exhibited high catalytic activity in a broader pH range and higher temperature than that of free lipase. In addition, the leaching of lipase from NPG could be prevented by matching the protein's diameter and pore size. Thus, the encapsulation of enzymes within NPG is quite useful for establishing new functions and will have wide applications for different chemical processes.",

        "abstract": "This study explored the effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5, an important environmentally microorganism in carbazole biodegradation process. Microbial cell/Fe3O4 nanoparticles biocomposite was constructed by assembling Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto the surface of Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5 cells. With the increase in Fe3O4 nanoparticles concentration, moderate deterioration in carbazole biodegradation was observed for microbial cell/Fe3O4 nanoparticles biocomposites. A concentration-dependent decrease in Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5 viability caused by Fe3O4 nanoparticles was observed. Zeta potential measurements suggested that electrostatic repulsion between microbial cell and Fe3O4 nanoparticles reduced nanotoxicity at low Fe3O4 nanoparticles concentration. The morphology characterization showed the small size of Fe3O4 nanoparticle made it possible to penetrate Sphingobium yanoikuyae XLDN2-5 cell membrane. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species increases, membrane damage, and DNA damage should be responsible for the antibacterial mechanism of Fe3O4 nanoparticles at high concentration. This study presented essential knowledge for better understanding of Fe3O4 nanoparticles behavior in the environment, and helping to promote safer and more effective application of nanomaterials in nanotechnology-based environmental bioremediation.",

However, its catalytic mechanisms, especially the key residues determining substrate specificity and affinity, are poorly understood. A metagenome-derived gene sequence, encoding a novel 6-phospho-\u03b2-glucosidase designated Pbgl25-217, was isolated and characterized. The optimal conditions for enzymatic activity were 37\u00b0C and pH 7; Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Mn(2+) stabilized the activity of Pbgl25-217, whereas Ni(2+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and Fe(3+) inhibited its activity. The Km and Vmax of Pbgl25-217 were 4.8 mM and 1,987.0 U mg(-1), respectively. Seven conserved residues were recognized by multiple alignments and were tested by site-directed mutagenesis for their functions in substrate recognition and catalytic reaction. The results suggest that residues S427, Lys435, and Tyr437 act as \"gatekeepers\" in a phosphate-binding loop and play important roles in phosphate recognition. This functional identification may provide insights into the specificity of 6-phospho-\u03b2-glycosidases in GH1 and be useful for designing further directed evolution.",

The consortium showed high atrazine-mineralizing efficiency and about 83.3% of 5 g l(-1) atrazine could be mineralized after 24 h degradation. Contrary to many other reported microorganisms, the consortium was insensitive to some nitrogenous fertilizers commonly used, not only in presence of 200 mg l(-1) atrazine but also in 5 g l(-1) atrazine mediums. After 24 h incubation, 200 mg l(-1) atrazine was completely mineralized despite of the presence of urea, (NH(4))(2)CO(3) and (NH(4))(2)HPO(4) in the medium. Very minor influence was observed when NH(4)Cl was added as additional nitrogen source. Advantages of the simple consortium, high mineralizing efficiency and insensitivity to most of exogenous nitrogen sources, all suggested application potential of the consortium for the bioremediation of atrazine-contaminated soils and waters.",

P. stutzeri SDM preferred to utilize lactate to growth, when both l-lactate and glucose were available, and the consumption of glucose was observed only after lactate had been exhausted. The\n Michaelis\u2013Menten constant for l-lactate was higher than that for d-lactate. The l-iLDH activity was more stable at 55\ufffdC, while the d-iLDH activity was lost. Both enzymes exhibited different solubilization with different detergents and different oxidation\n rates with different electron acceptors.

The food-grade cell surface display vector was constructed based on safe DNA elements from lactic acid bacteria containing the following: pSH71 replicon from Lactococcus lactis, lactose metabolism genes from L. casei ATCC 334 as complementation markers, and surface layer protein gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 for cell surface display. The feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) on L. casei. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GFP antibody confirmed that GFP was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. The stability of recombinant L. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. These results indicate that the food-grade host/vector system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.",

        "abstract": "Background: Bioethanol production from various starchy materials has received much attention in recent years. \ufffd\ufffd-Amylases are key enzymes in the bioconversion process of starchy biomass to biofuels, food or other products. The properties of thermostability, pH stability, and Ca-independency are important in the development of such fermentation process. Results: A novel Flavobacteriaceae Sinomicrobium \ufffd\ufffd-amylase (FSA) was identified and characterized from genomic analysis of a novel Flavobacteriaceae species. It is closely related with archaeal \ufffd\ufffd-amylases in the GH13-7 subfamily, but is evolutionary distant with other bacterial \ufffd\ufffd-amylases. Based on the conserved sequence alignment and homology modeling, with minor variation, the Zn2+- and Ca2+-binding sites of FSA were predicated to be the same as those of the archaeal thermophilic \ufffd\ufffd-amylases. The recombinant \ufffd\ufffd-amylase was highly expressed and biochemically characterized. It showed optimum activity at pH 6.0, high enzyme stability at pH 6.0 to 11.0, but weak thermostability. A disulfide bond was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in domain C and resulted in the apparent improvement of the enzyme activity at high temperature and broad pH range. Moreover, about 50% of the enzyme activity was detected under 100\ufffd\ufffdC condition, whereas no activity was observed for the wild type enzyme. Its thermostability was also enhanced to some extent, with the half-life time increasing from 25 to 55 minutes at 50\ufffd\ufffdC. In addition, after the introduction of the disulfide bond, the protein became a Ca-independent enzyme. Conclusions: The improved stability of FSA suggested that the domain C contributes to the overall stability of the enzyme under extreme conditions. In addition, successfully directed modification and special evolutionary status of FSA imply its directional reconstruction potentials for bioethanol production, as well as for other industrial applications. ? 2014 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Flavin reductase DszD, which catalyzes the reduction of oxidated flavin by NAD(P)H, is indispensable for the biodesulfurization process. In this work, a flavin reductase DszD in M. goodii X7B was purified to homogeneity, and then its encoding gene dszD was amplified and expressed in Escherichia coli. DszD is a homodimer with each subunit binding one FMN as cofactor. The K m values for FMN and NADH of the purified recombinant DszD were determined to be 6.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM and 77.9 \u00b1 5.4 \u03bcM, respectively. The optimal temperature for DszD activity was 55\u00b0C. DszD can use FMN or FAD as substrate to generate FMNH 2 or FADH 2 as product. DszD was coexpressed with DBT monooxygenase DszC, the enzyme catalyzing the first step of the biodesulfurization process. It was indicated that the coexpressed DszD could effectively enhance the DszC catalyzed DBT desulfurization reaction. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

XLDN4-9. C(1)-carbazoles were degraded in preference to carbazole and C(2)-carbazoles. The biodegradation of C(1)-carbazoles or C(2)-carbazoles was influenced by the positions of methyl substitutions. Among C(1)-carbazole isomers, 1-methyl carbazole was the most susceptible. C(2)-carbazole isomers with substitutions on the same benzo-nucleus were more susceptible at a concentration of less than 3.4 microg g(-1) petroleum, especially when harboring one substitution on position 1. In particular, 1,5-dimethyl carbazole was the most recalcitrant dimethyl isomer.",

Compared with the MFC inoculated with domesticated microbial community, the MFC inoculated with wastewater not only showed higher power density (543.75\u202fmW\u202fm) and coulomb efficiency (22.10%), but also exhibited higher removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (75.59%), total nitrogen (76.15%), and ammonia nitrogen (83.23%), meeting the demand of wastewater discharge standard of China. Sequencing analysis revealed that the MFC inoculated with wastewater were richer in microbial community, and some bacteria such as Saprospiraceae and Caldilineaceae were beneficial for its good performance. In contrast, the microbial community of the MFC inoculated with domesticated microbial community was relatively simple. These results indicated that MFCs may be a sustainable method for organic acid fermentation wastewater treatment without any preprocessing.",

Neither enzyme activities was constitutive, but both of them might be induced by either enantiomer of lactate. P. stutzeri SDM preferred to utilize lactate to growth, when both L-lactate and glucose were available, and the consumption of glucose was observed only after lactate had been exhausted. The Michaelis-Menten constant for L-lactate was higher than that for D-lactate. The L-iLDH activity was more stable at 55 degrees C, while the D-iLDH activity was lost. Both enzymes exhibited different solubilization with different detergents and different oxidation rates with different electron acceptors. Combining activity staining and previous proteomic analysis, the results suggest that there are two separate enzymes in P. stutzeri SDM, which play an important role in converting lactate to pyruvate.",

In the last two decades, lots of work has been done to develop strains for ethanol producing. Research progress on metabolic engineering of strains for fuel ethanol production is summarized, including genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to utilize starch, pentose and cellulose, Zymomonas mobilis to ferment arabinose and xylose, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca to introduce heterogenous ethanol production pathway. The aim of engineering these strains is to obtain an ideal microorganism which can converse the available carbon sources to ethanol rapidly and efficiently with high tolerance to ethanol and to inhibitory components in the cheap materials such as lignocellulose hydrolysate. The importance of fuel ethanol will be a stimulus to develop engineered hardy strains to utilize cheap materials for high ethanol concentration production. Since both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis are generally regarded as safe (GRAS), genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae which can utilize raw starch directly and recombinant Zymomonas mobilis which can ferment glucose, arabinose and xylose in the lignocellulose hydrolysate have potential application to industry in the near future.",

        "abstract": "The pyrE gene, encoding orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase), was cloned by nested PCR and colony blotting from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6872, which is widely used in nucleotide production. Sequence analysis shows that there is a lack of an important conserved lysine (Lys 73 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium OPRTase) in the C. ammoniagenes OPRTase. This lysine has been considered to contribute to the initiation of catalysis. The enzyme was overexpressed and purified from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The molecular mass of the purified OPRTase was determined to be 45.4 +/- 1.5 kDa by gel filtration. Since the molecular mass for the subunit of the enzyme was 21.3 +/- 0.6 kDa, the native enzyme exists as a dimer. Divalent magnesium was necessary for the activity of the enzyme and can be substituted for by Mn2+ and Co2+. The optimal pH for the forward (phosphoribosyl transfer) reaction is 10.5 to 11.5, which is higher than that of other reported OPRTases, and the optimal pH for the reverse (pyrophosphorolysis) reaction is 5.5 to 6.5. The Km values for the four substrates were determined to be 33 microM for orotate, 64 microM for 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), 45 microM for orotidine-5-phosphate (OMP), and 36 microM for pyrophosphate. The Km value for OMP is much larger than those of other organisms. These differences may be due to the absence of Lys 73, which is present in the active sites of other OPRTases and is known to interact with OMP and PRPP.",

However, optically active (R)-2-HBA could not be produced through microbial fermentation or chemical synthesis. Several biocatalytic methods have been reported for the production of (R)-2-HBA. Those processes used expensive and scarce substrates and would not be suitable for practical application. In this work, Gluconobacter oxydans DSM 2003 was confirmed to have the ability to produce (R)-2-HBA from 1,2-butanediol, a non-toxic and inexpensive compound that had a great potential for biotechnological processes. Under the optimal conditions, the biocatalytic process produced (R)-2-HBA at a high concentration (18.5 g l(-1)) and a high enantiomeric excess (99.7%). The biocatalysis process introduced in this study may provide a technically and economically interesting route for production of (R)-2-HBA.",

Therefore, as the main technological process of desulfurization of diesel oil, the ability of catalytic hydrogenation (HDS) to remove the main organic sulfur compounds in diesel oil such as DBT and Cx-DBT is relatively low. The study aimed at the treatment of catalytic diesel oil whose sulfur content was 3358 \u03bcg/g by a process that combined HDS with biodesulfurization (BDS). The results showed that the sulfur content of catalytic diesel oil was less than 20 \u03bcg/g; further using gas chromatography with atomic emission detector (GC-AED) to detect the distribution of sulfur compounds in diesel oil before and after desulfurization, it indicated that the technology that combined HDS with BDS could remove most of DBT and Cx-DBT in catalytic diesel oil effectively and showed favorable applied foreground.",

        "abstract": "Development of novel anodic materials that could facilitate microbial biofilm formation, substrate transfer, and electron transfer is vital to enhance the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In this work, nickel-coated sponge, as a novel and inexpensive material with an open three-dimensional macro-porous structure, was employed as an anode to encapsulate microbial cells. Compared with planar carbon paper, the nickel-coated sponge did not only offer a high surface area to facilitate microbial cells attachment and colonization but also supported sufficient substrate transfer and electron transfer due to multiplexed and highly conductive pathways. As expected, the resulting nickel-coated sponge biofilm demonstrated excellent electrochemical activity and power output stability during electricity generation processes. A higher maximum power density of 996 mW m(-2) and a longer, more stable electricity generation period were achieved with the nickel-coated sponge biofilm than previously reported results. Notably, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal reached 90.3% in the anode chamber, suggesting that the nickel-coated sponge is a highly promising anodic material and an efficient immobilization method for the fabrication of MFCs.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine, a toxic and addictive alkaloid from tobacco, is an environmental pollutant in areas near cigarette production facilities. Over the last decade, our group has studied, in depth, the pyrrolidine pathway of nicotine degradation in  S16. However, little is known regarding whole mechanism(s) regulating transcription of the nicotine degradation pathway gene cluster. In the present study, we comprehensively elucidate an overall view of the NicR2-mediated two-step mechanism regulating 3-succinoyl-pyridine (SP) biotransformation, which involves the association of free NicR2 with two promoters and the dissociation of NicR2 from the NicR2-promoter complex. NicR2 can bind to another promoter, , and regulate expression of the nicotine-degrading genes in the middle of  gene cluster, which are not controlled by the previously reported  promoter. We identified the function of the inverted repeat bases on the two promoters responsible for NicR2 binding and found out that the -35/-10 motif for RNA polymerase is overlapped by the NicR2 binding site. We clarify the exact role of 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP), which acts as an antagonist and may prevent binding of free NicR2 to the promoters but cannot release NicR2 from the promoters. Finally, a regulatory model is proposed, which consists of three parts: the interaction between NicR2 and two promoters ( and ), the interaction between NicR2 and two effectors (HSP and SP), and the interaction between NicR2 and RNA polymerase. We report the entire process underlying the NicR2 regulatory mechanism from association between free NicR2 and two promoters to dissociation of the NicR2-promoter complex. NicR2 can bind to another promoter, , which controls expression of nicotine-degrading genes that are not controlled by the  promoter. We identified specific nucleotides of the  promoter responsible for NicR2 binding. HSP was further demonstrated as an antagonist, which prevents the binding of NicR2 to the  and  promoters, by locking NicR2 in the derepression conformation. The competition between NicR2 and RNA polymerase is essential to initiate transcription of nicotine-degrading genes. This study extends our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biodegradation of environmental pollutants and toxicants.",

        "abstract": "The platform chemical lactate is currently produced mainly through the fermentation of sugars presented in biomass. Besides the synthesis of biodegradable polylactate, lactate is also viewed as a feedstock for the green chemistry of the future. Pyruvate, another important platform chemical, can be produced from lactate through biocatalysis.It was established that whole cells of Pseudomonas stutzeri SDM catalyze lactate oxidation with lactate-induced NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenases (iLDHs) through the inherent electron transfer chain. Unlike the lactate oxidation processes observed in previous reports, the mechanism underlying lactate oxidation described in the present study excluded the costliness of the cofactor regeneration step and production of the byproduct hydrogen peroxide.Biocatalysis conditions were optimized by using the cheap dl-lactate as the substrate and whole cells of the lactate-utilizing P. stutzeri SDM as catalyst. Under optimal conditions, the biocatalytic process produced pyruvate at a high concentration (48.4 g l(-1)) and a high yield (98%). The bioconversion system provides a promising alternative for the green production of pyruvate.",

Through divergence and evolution, enzymes have been refined to exhibit specificity towards one reaction or substrate, and are thus commonly assumed as \"specialists\". However, some enzymes are \"generalists\" that catalyze a range of substrates and reactions. This property has been defined as enzyme promiscuity and is of great importance for the evolution of new functions. The promiscuities of two enzymes, namely glycerol dehydratase and diol dehydratase, were herein exploited for catalyzing long-chain polyols, including 1,2-butanediol, 1,2,4-butanetriol, erythritol, 1,2-pentanediol, 1,2,5-pentanetriol, and 1,2,6-hexanetriol. The specific activities required for catalyzing these six long-chain polyols were studied via in vitro enzyme assays, and the catalytic efficiencies were increased through protein engineering. The promiscuous functions were subsequently applied in vivo to establish 1,4-butanediol pathways from lignocellulose derived compounds, including xylose and erythritol. In addition, a pathway for 1-pentanol production from 1,2-pentanediol was also constructed. The results suggest that exploiting enzyme promiscuity is promising for exploring new catalysts, which would expand the repertoire of genetic elements available to synthetic biology and may provide a starting point for designing and engineering novel pathways for valuable chemicals.",

        "abstract": "Halomonas sp. Y2 is a halotolerant alkaliphilic strain from Na-rich pulp mill wastewater with high alkalinity (pH >11.0). Transcriptome analysis of this isolate revealed this strain may use various transport systems for pH homeostasis. In particular, the genes encoding four putative Na/H antiporters were differentially expressed upon acidic or alkaline conditions. Further evidence, from heterologous expression and mutant studies, suggested that Halomonas sp. Y2 employs its Na/H antiporters in a labor division way to deal with saline and alkaline environments. Ha-NhaD2 displayed robust Na(Li) resistance and high transport activities in Escherichia coli; a \u0394Ha-nhaD2 mutant exhibited growth inhibition at high Na(Li) concentrations at pH values of 6.2, 8.0, and 10.0, suggesting its physiological role in osmotic homeostasis. In contrast, Ha-NhaD1 showed much weaker activities in ion exporting and pH homeostasis. Ha-Mrp displayed a combination of properties similar to those of Mrp transporters from some Bacillus alkaliphiles and neutrophiles. This conferred obvious Na(Li, K) resistance in E. coli-deficient strains, as those ion transport spectra of some neutrophil Mrp antiporters. Conversely, similar to the Bacillus alkaliphiles, Ha-Mrp showed central roles in the pH homeostasis of Halomonas sp. Y2. An Ha-mrp-disrupted mutant was seriously inhibited by high concentrations of Na(Li, K) but only under alkaline conditions. Ha-NhaP was determined to be a K/H antiporter and shown to confer strong K resistance both at acidic and alkaline stresses.",

        "abstract": "The physiological roles of silent genes are still unsolved puzzles and their application potentials are unexplored. Herein, a silent glycerol catabolism pathway encoded by glp system was activated in a Klebsiella pneumoniae mutant, of which the acetoin degradation pathway was blocked. Surprisingly, the activation produced significant effects on cellular metabolism and over 90% of the carbon flux was redirected to acetoin biosynthesis, which was formerly a minor product in this mutant. Transcription analyses suggest that the genes involved in acetoin, 1,3-propanediol and adenosyl-cobalamin biosynthesis were differentially regulated upon the glp system activation, demonstrating the cross-talk between silent and active pathways. Through pathway, cofactor and bioprocess engineering, high-level acetoin production from glycerol (32.2gL, 90.8% of the theoretical value) was achieved. Our findings suggest that some silent genes represent unexplored switches of cellular metabolic status and activating them may be an easy strategy for reprogramming microorganisms into efficient cell factories.",

A novel strain GYL isolated from soil samples could efficiently convert glycerol to 1,3-PD anaerobically. The physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain GYL were determined, indicating that strain GYL is a member of Clostridium perfringens with the neighbor-joining method of 16S rRNA gene sequences. The fermentation properties of strain GYL were also investigated systematically, which showed that the strain has a fast growth speed and high tolerance to 200g/L glycerol. Batch fermentation was carried out at a high glycerol concentration of 100g/L, and strain GYL produced 36.7g/L 1,3-PD. In fed-batch fermentation, strain GYL showed a maximum productivity of 2.0g/(L\u00b7h), and produced 40.0g/L 1,3-PD, with a high yield of 0.68mol 1,3-PD/mol glycerol. This study shows that the newly isolated strain GYL may have potential for 1,3-PD production from glycerol.",

The natural coordination among different metabolic pathways contributes to the complexity of metabolic modification, which hampers the development of biorefineries. Herein, the coordination between the oxidative and reductive branches of glycerol metabolism was rearranged in Klebsiella oxytoca to improve the 1,3-propanediol production. After deliberating on the product value, carbon conservation, redox balance, biological compatibility and downstream processing, the lactate-producing pathway was chosen for coupling with the 1,3-propanediol-producing pathway. Then, the other pathways of 2,3-butanediol, ethanol, acetate, and succinate were blocked in sequence, leading to improved d-lactate biosynthesis, which as return drove the 1,3-propanediol production. Meanwhile, efficient co-production of 1,3-propanediol and l-lactate was also achieved by replacing ldhD with ldhL from Bacillus coagulans. The engineered strains PDL-5 and PLL co-produced over 70g/L 1,3-propanediol and over 100g/L optically pure d-lactate and l-lactate, respectively, with high conversion yields of over 0.95mol/mol from glycerol.",

Treating heavy oil-produced water (HOPW) is a challenge owing to the high recalcitrance and heterogeneity of chemicals it contains. A full-scale HOPW treatment plant was built at a capacity of 10,000\u202fm/d with the indigenous microbial community. After the treatment, the outlet water reached the design standard. The microbial community structures in all treatment stages were analyzed by using Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The composition of microbial community changed greatly with the changes in environmental conditions, especially with the only artificially regulated parameter of dissolved oxygen. In the anaerobic stage, the community converted the recalcitrant chemical oxygen demand to biological oxygen demand (BOD), and played a major role in enhancing the biodegradability of HOPW. During the aerobic stage, the community mainly mineralized BOD. These results suggest that the structures of indigenous microbial community differed in different treatment stages to accomplish the corresponding functions. Based on these findings, it is proposed that exploiting the plasticity of microbial communities for bioremediation is feasible, especially treating wastewater with varied components.",

Extensive efforts have been invested in the metabolic engineering of microorganisms for biosynthesis of chemicals and fuels. Among these, direct conversion of CO to chemicals by photoautotrophic microorganism cyanobacteria represents a green route with incredibly potent. Cyanobacteria have been engineered for the production of numerous biofuels and chemicals, such as 2,3-butanediol, fatty acids, isobutyraldehyde, and n-butanol. Under the current condition, it might be initially wiser to produce chemicals with higher value or higher yield. Photosynthetic production of C3 platform chemicals could withdraw carbon close to fixation to maximize the pool of available carbon, thus achieving the strong production rates. Photosynthetic production of terpenoids is another good choice due to the higher value of these compounds. Here, we review recent advances in generating C3 chemicals and valuable terpenoids from cyanobacteria.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic biology emerges as a powerful approach for unlocking the potential of cyanobacteria to produce various chemicals. However, the highly oxidative intracellular environment of cyanobacteria is incompatible to numerous introduced enzymes from anaerobes. In this study, we explore a strategy based on natural compartmentalization of cyanobacterial heterocysts to overcome the incompatibility. Hence, the oxygen-sensitive 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) biosynthetic pathway was selected as a model and insulated in heterocysts to evaluate the proposed strategy. Thus, the genes from different sources for 1,3-PDO production were tandemly arrayed with promoter, resulting the assembled 1,3-PDO synthetic cassettes. Then the synthetic cassettes were integrated into the chromosome of Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 by homologous recombination, respectively. The engineered strain P11 containing the genes from facultative anaerobe Klebsiella pneumoniae (cassette KP) accumulated 46.0 mg L of 1,3-PDO when heterocysts were present, which is approximately 1.7-fold higher than that of no heterocysts. As for the strains (P12, P13, and P14) containing the genes from strictly anaerobic bacterium Clostridium butyricum (cassette CB), the product 1,3-PDO could only be detected when heterocysts were present. These results indicate that insulation of the oxygen-sensitive 1,3-PDO pathway with heterocysts is an effective way to protect these enzymes in cyanobacteria. The strategy may have the potential of serving as a universal strategy to overcome the incompatibility of oxygen-sensitivity in synthetic biology.",

        "abstract": "Many plant natural products have remarkable pharmacological activities. They are mainly produced directly by extraction from higher plants, which can hardly keep up with the surging global demand. Furthermore, the over-felling of many medicinal plants has undesirable effects on the ecological balance. In this study, we constructed a photoautotrophic platform with the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to directly convert the greenhouse gas CO2 into an array of valuable healthcare products, including resveratrol, naringenin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid. These six compounds can be further branched to many other precious and useful natural products. Various strategies including introducing a feedback-inhibition-resistant enzyme, creating functional fusion proteins, and increasing malonyl-CoA supply have been systematically investigated to increase the production. The highest titers of these natural products reached 4.1\u2013128.2 mg L\u22121 from the photoautotrophic system, which are highly comparable with those obtained by many other heterotrophic microorganisms using carbohydrates. Several advantages such as independence from carbohydrate feedstocks, functionally assembling P450s, and availability of plentiful NADPH and ATP support that this photosynthetic platform is uniquely suited for producing plant natural products. This platform also provides a green route for direct conversion of CO2 to many aromatic building blocks, a promising alternative to petrochemical-based production of bulk aromatic compounds.",

High-temperature fermentation has multiple advantages, such as lower equipment requirement and energy consumption, which are essential for lowering operating costs. We identified and introduced a unique d-lactate dehydrogenase into a thermotolerant butane-2,3-diol-producing strain. Carbon flux \u201ctrapping\u201d was achieved by a \u201ctrapping point\u201d created by combination of the introduced enzyme and the host efflux pump, which afforded irreversible transport of d-lactic acid. The overall carbon flux of the engineered strain was significantly enhanced and was redistributed predominantly to d-lactic acid. Under optimized conditions at 50\u2009\u00b0C, d-lactic acid reached the highest titer (226.6\u2005g\u2009L\u22121) reported to date. This discovery allows us to extend the carbon flux trapping strategy to engineering complex metabolic networks.",

Here, temperature-routed whole-cell catalysis was developed using two novel enzymes from a thermophilic actinomycete. Ferulic acid, a model lignin derivative, was efficiently converted to vanillyl alcohol by maintaining the reaction temperature at 30\uf0b0C. However, when the temperature was increased to 50\uf0b0C, ferulic acid was mainly converted to vanillin with a productivity of 1.1 g/L/h. This is because the redundant ADHs activities were eliminated at the high temperature, whereas the activities of functional enzymes from the thermophilic strain were retained. Since the biocatalyst could convert many other renewable cinnamic acid derivatives to their corresponding aromatic aldehydes/alcohols, this novel strategy may be extended to generate an enormous array of valuable aldehydes/alcohols.",

        "abstract": "Cassava is one of the most efficient and rich crops in terms of carbohydrate production, which is a tropical perennial plant that grows on poor or depleted soils. Microbial conversion of such a renewable raw material to useful products is an important objective in industrial biotechnology. L-Lactic acid was efficiently produced from cassava powder by a Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain CASL. The fermentation properties of cassava powder were compared with those of glucose and corn powder. The efficiencies of various fermentation strategies for L-lactic acid production from cassava powder, including simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), two-step fermentation (TSF) and simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification and fermentation (SLSF), were investigated. The high L-lactic acid concentration (175.4 g/l) was obtained using 275 g/l of cassava powder concentration (total sugar of 222.5 g/l) in SSF batch fermentation. This is the highest L-lactic acid concentration reported, from cassava source, and it provides an efficient L-lactic acid production process with cheap raw bioresources, such as cassava powder.",

Up to 107 g l(-1) L-lactic acid of optical purity 99.8% was obtained with NaOH as pH regulator. Unexpectedly, accumulated cells did not necessarily lead to increased L-lactic acid production. Kinetic and viable cells analyses revealed that L-lactic acid production by Bacillus sp. 2-6 was closely related to the growth of viable cells. Accumulated unviable cells had a slight or negative effect on production efficiency. Therefore, the number of repeated batches should be limited to avoid the accumulation of unviable cells.

        "title": "Characterization of benzoate degradation by newly isolated bacterium Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2",
        "abstract": "An effective benzoate-degradation strain XP-M2 belonging to the genus Pseudomonas , was newly isolated from aromatic compounds contaminated soils. The growing cells of strain XP-M2 completely degraded 10 g/L benzoate within 12 h, and the degradation efficiency was found to be higher than other reports. Catechol and cis,cis -muconic acid as the metabolic intermediates were identified by gas chromatography\u2013high-resolution mass spectrometry, and the catA gene encoding catechol 1,2-dioxygenase in this strain was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli , which indicated that benzoate degradation by Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2 was via the ortho -cleavage pathway. In addition, the Andrews model was used to describe the functional relationship between specific growth rate and benzoate concentrations with kinetics parameters: K S = 2.47 g/L, K I = 3.81 g/L. Keywords Benzoate Kinetics Andrews model Microbial Bioremediation Waste treatment 1 Introduction Microbial degradation of aromatic compounds is practically significant to environmental bioremediation and waste treatment. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in exploring the ability of microorganisms to detoxify aromatic compounds [1,2] . Benzoate is a model aromatic compound and found as a contaminant in dye and food processing effluents [3] . This compound can be degraded aerobically through ortho pathway or meta pathway via catechol branch [1,4,5] . Most of the studies on the biodegradation of benzoate have been conducted with low concentration of benzoate (\u22643 g/L) [3,6\u201312] . But in realistic conditions, including environmental applications as well as biotransformation of benzoate into useful chemical products, high concentrations of benzoate are normally encountered and cause the biological toxicity. For example, when producing catechol [13] and cis,cis -muconic acid [12] from benzoate, high concentration of benzoate is beneficial to increase products yield. In order to evaluate the optimal conditions in biological process, a fundamental understanding of the key kinetic parameters was necessary. Simkins and Alexander previously applied several kinetic models derived from Monod model to simulate the benzoate degradation at low concentrations (0.01\u2013100 mg/L benzoate) [11] . Unlike Monod model, the Andrews substrate inhibition model incorporating inhibition function is valid for high concentration of inhibitory substrates to analyze the microorganism growth kinetics [14] . In this study, an effective benzoate-degradation strain was isolated and characterized. The metabolic pathway was proposed by identification of key metabolites, cloning and expression of the catA gene. Moreover, the Andrews model was used to analyze substrate inhibition kinetics for microbial growth. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Media and cultural conditions Cultures were grown in minimal medium (MXBM) containing (per liter of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) 1.0 g NH 4 Cl, 0.20 g MgSO 4 , 0.02 g FeCl 3 \u00b76H 2 O, 0.01 g ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.01 g CaCl 2 and 1 mL trace metal solution. Trace metal solution (per liter of 100 mM HCl) contained 0.1 g CoCl 2 \u00b76H 2 O, 0.1 g MnCl 2 \u00b74H 2 O, 0.1 g ZnCl 2 , 0.06 g H 3 BO 3 , 0.02 g Na 2 MoO 4 \u00b72H 2 O, 0.02 g NiCl 2 \u00b76H 2 O, 0.02 g CuCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O. The modified M9 medium (17.1 g/L Na 2 HPO 4 \u00b712H 2 O, 3.0 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 g/L NaCl, 1.0 g/L NH 4 Cl, 0.12 g/L MgSO 4 , 0.01 g/L CaCl 2 ), LB medium (10 g/L peptone and 5 g/L yeast extract) and nutrient medium (10 g/L peptone and 5 g/L beef extract) supplemented with 10 g/L benzoate, 0.02 g/L FeCl 3 \u00b76H 2 O, 0.01 g/L EDTA in buffer were used for comparative experiments. The shaking culture was aerobically incubated in a 300-mL flask containing 30 mL medium at 37 \u00b0C with an agitation rate of 180 rpm. Triplicate experiments were performed under the same condition. Strains, plasmids and primers used in this study are shown in Table 1 . 2.2 Analytical methods The culture was centrifuged at 8000 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Double volume of ethanol was added to the supernatant, followed by centrifugation (12,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min) and filtration. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Hewlett-Packard, Agilent 1100 series) analysis was performed using a mobile phase of methanol/30 mM acetic acid (60:40, v/v). The filtrate (100 mL) was evaporated to dryness and trimethylsilylated (TMS) by N , O -bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. After drying, the sample was redissolved in ethyl acetate and analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC\u2013HR-MS) (Waters GCT mass spectrometer, coupled to an Agilent HP6890 gas chromatograph). 2.3 Analysis of substrate inhibition kinetics for microbial growth Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2 was inoculated into culture with 7 g/L benzoate. The culture was harvested at late exponential phase, washed twice, and re-suspended in MXBM media to reach a final concentration of 0.03 g/L dry cell weight (DCW). During the course of bacterial growth, aliquots of the culture were sampled at average time intervals. The microbial growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the culture at 620 nm, and the cell concentration was defined as DCW per liter of culture (1 OD 620 unit represents 0.3579 g/L DCW). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Identification of an effective benzoate-degradation strain Strain XP-M2 was isolated by the enrichment method described previously [13] from aromatic compounds contaminated soils using MXBM medium at 37 \u00b0C. BLASTN search analysis revealed that the diagnostic sequence of 16S rRNA gene showed high identity (\u226599.0%) with those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA1, P. aeruginosa PA7, and P. aeruginosa CMG860. This sequence has been deposited in GenBank database under accession number EU410508 . Strain XP-M2 was also identified as Pseudomonas genus according to physiological characteristics, biochemical characteristics and carbon utilization tests. 3.2 The metabolic pathway of benzoate degradation During benzoate degradation by resting cells of Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2, one metabolic intermediate obviously accumulated and was identified as cis,cis -muconic acid according to authentic standard by HPLC analyses. Identification of key metabolites was further supported by GC\u2013HR-MS analyses using the NIST MS Search 2.0 (NIST, mass spectral library). High-resolution mass spectra of two key trimethylsilylated metabolic intermediates were identical to those of TMS-derivatized catechol and TMS-derivatized cis,cis -muconic acid. The catA gene, which was the characteristic gene of ortho -cleavage pathway, was cloned by PCR with primers ( Table 1 ) designed on comparison of the related sequences of P. aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa PA7, P. aeruginosa PACS2, P. aeruginosa C3719 and P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 by vector NTI software. Sequence of the catA gene has been deposited in GenBank database under accession number EU503129 . The catA gene was cloned into expression vector to form pET27b- catA and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The transformant showed clear catechol to cis,cis -muconic acid conversion activity, while there was no change for the controls (data not shown). These results indicate that Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2 degrades benzoate via the ortho -cleavage pathway. 3.3 Growth on 1\u201315 g/L benzoate Typical profiles of cell growth and benzoate degradation of strain XP-M2 with different benzoate concentrations as the sole carbon and energy source were shown in Fig. 1 . In the range of 1\u201315 g/L benzoate, strain XP-M2 was able to assimilate benzoate for growth with higher cell concentration at higher substrate concentration. The yield coefficient between the gain of biomass and the consumption of benzoate ( Y = DCW/benzoate) was essentially within the range of 0.10\u20130.25. 3.4 Comparison of degradative competence with other strains Effective degradation of benzoate is desirable for environmental applications as well as biotransformation. For comparison, two benzoate-degrading strains, Rhodococcus rhodochrous DSM 6263 [8] and Pseudomonas putida ATCC 700801 [10] were used to compare with strain XP-M2 in modified M9 medium, LB medium and nutrient medium ( Fig. 2 ). As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , strain XP-M2 completely degraded 10 g/L benzoate within 12 h in all conditions with biomass of 1.32 g/L, 3.65 g/L and 3.48 g/L DCW, while P. putida ATCC 700801 degraded no more than 3.00% of benzoate in all conditions. R. rhodochrous DSM 6263 only degraded 9.60% and 9.38% of benzoate in M9 medium and nutrient medium, respectively. Similar results were also found by comparing with those reported previously. Other researchers have reported complete degradation of 0.38 g/L benzoate in 14 h using Halomonas campisalis ATCC 700597 [3] , 0.6 g/L benzoate in 11 h using P. putida ATCC 49451 [9] , and 2.5 g/L benzoate in 62 h using Sphingobacterium sp. GCG [12] . 3.5 Analysis of substrate inhibition kinetics for microbial growth As shown in Fig. 1 , the primary result of high-concentration benzoate was an increase in the lag time, which indicated benzoate at high concentration had certain inhibitory effect on cell growth and substrate degradation. In early lag phase, the cells grew slowly and benzoate concentrations changed little. The specific growth rate in this stage was calculated using the following equation [15] : (1) \u03bc = ln \u2009 ( X 2 / X 1 ) ( t 2 \u2212 t 1 ) where \u03bc was the specific growth rate (h \u22121 ) and X was the biomass concentration (g/L). The Andrews model was selected for its mathematical simplicity and wide acceptance for inhibitory substrate such as phenol, benzene and toluene in wastewaters, and it was frequently expressed as follows [14,15] : (2) \u03bc = \u03bc max S K S + S + S 2 / K I where \u03bc max was the maximum specific growth rate in the absence of inhibition (h \u22121 ); S was limiting substrate concentration (g/L); K S was saturation constant (g/L); K I was inhibition constant (g/L). The results shown in Fig. 3 indicated that the Andrews model was also suitable for benzoate degradation with the correlation coefficient of 0.97269. The optimal kinetic parameters were obtained as follows: K S = 2.47 g/L, K I = 3.81 g/L. In this model, the specific growth rate initially increased along with increasing benzoate concentration. When benzoate concentration reached 3.07 g/L, the specific growth rate reached the maximum value of 0.54 h \u22121 , and then decreased obviously with further increasing substrate concentration ( Fig. 3 ). It was obvious that when the benzoate concentration was higher than 3.07 g/L, the effect of biological toxicity became prominent and thus increased the lag time. 4 Conclusions In this study, we newly isolated and characterized an effective benzoate-degradation strain Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2. The key metabolic intermediates were identified as catechol and cis,cis -muconic acid by HPLC and GC\u2013HR-MS, and the catA gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli , which indicated that Pseudomonas sp. XP-M2 degraded benzoate via the ortho -cleavage pathway. Furthermore, the Andrews model was used to analyze the microorganism growth kinetics. For this model incorporating the inhibitory effect of high concentration of benzoate, it would be of value in investigation of the stability of biological processes, selecting the appropriate startup procedures, and providing a prediction of the specific growth rate depending on substrate concentrations.

In the present study, corncob molasses containing a high content of xylose, which is one of the lignocellulosic biomasses and a waste by-product from xylitol production, was used for L-lactic acid production via a newly isolated xylose utilizing Bacillus sp. strain XZL9. Bacillus sp. strain XZL9 can utilize the mixture of sugars including xylose, arabinose, and glucose in corncob molasses for L-lactic acid production. High concentration of L-lactic acid (74.7 g l\u207b\u00b9) was obtained from corncob molasses (initial total sugars of 91.4 g l\u207b\u00b9) in fed-batch fermentation.

        "abstract": "The demand for lactic acid has been increasing considerably because of its use as a monomer for the synthesis of polylactic acid (PLA), which is a promising and environment-friendly alternative to plastics derived from petrochemicals. Optically pure L-lactic acid is essential for polymerization of PLA. The high fermentation cost of L-lactic acid is another limitation for PLA polymers to compete with conventional plastics.A Bacillus sp. strain 2-6 for production of L-lactic acid was isolated at 55 degrees C from soil samples. Its thermophilic characteristic made it a good lactic acid producer because optically pure L-lactic acid could be produced by this strain under open condition without sterilization. In 5-liter batch fermentation of Bacillus sp. 2-6, 118.0 g/liter of L-lactic acid with an optical purity of 99.4% was obtained from 121.3 g/liter of glucose. The yield was 97.3% and the average productivity was 4.37 g/liter/h. The maximum L-lactic acid concentration of 182.0 g/liter was obtained from 30-liter fed-batch fermentation with an average productivity of 3.03 g/liter/h and product optical purity of 99.4%.With the newly isolated Bacillus sp. strain 2-6, high concentration of optically pure L-lactic acid could be produced efficiently in open fermentation without sterilization, which would lead to a new cost-effective method for polymer-grade L-lactic acid production from renewable resources.",

R. erythropolis XP could efficiently desulfurize benzonaphthothiophene, a complicated model sulfur compound that exists in crude oil. The desulfurization product of benzonaphthothiophene was identified as alpha-hydroxy-beta-phenyl-naphthalene. Resting cells could desulfurize diesel oil (total organic sulfur, 259 ppm) after hydrodesulfurization. The sulfur content of diesel oil was reduced by 94.5% by using the resting cell biocatalyst for 24 h at 30 degrees C. Biodesulfurization of crude oils was also investigated. After 72 h of treatment at 30 degrees C, 62.3% of the total sulfur content in Fushun crude oil (initial total sulfur content, 3,210 ppm) and 47.2% of that in Sudanese crude oil (initial total sulfur, 1,237 ppm) were removed. Gas chromatography with pulsed-flame photometric detector analysis was used to evaluate the effect of R. erythropolis XP treatment on the sulfur content in Fushun crude oil, and it was shown that most organic sulfur compounds were eliminated after biodesulfurization.",

The strain was identified as Bacillus pumilus based on biochemical tests, cellular fatty acid composition, riboprint pattern and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. In the biotransformation of isoeugenol, vanillin was the main product. With the growing culture of B. pumilus S-1, 10g l(-1) isoeugenol was converted to 3.75g l(-1) vanillin in 150 h, with a molar yield of 40.5% that is the highest up to now. Dehydrodiisoeugenol, a dimer of isoeugenol, was separated by preparative thin layer chromatography and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the accurate masses obtained from gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, two key intermediates, isoeugenol-epoxide (IE) and isoeugenol-diol (ID), were identified by mass spectra interpretations. The biotransformation with resting cells showed that vanillin was oxidized to vanillic acid and then to protocatechuic acid before the aromatic ring was broken. These findings suggest that isoeugenol is degraded through an epoxide-diol pathway.",

The strain showed relatively high energy consumption in its growth-related metabolism in comparison with other lactic acid producers. When the fermentation was repeated with 10% (v/v) of previous culture to start a new batch, D-lactic acid production shifted from being cell-maintenance-dependent to cell-growth-dependent. In comparison with the one-reactor system, D-lactic acid production increased approximately 9% in the fourth batch of the two-reactor system. Strain CASD is an efficient D-lactic acid producer with increased growth rate at the early stage of repeated cycles, which explains the strain's physiological adaptation to repeated batch culture and improved performance in the two-reactor fermentation system. From a kinetic point of view, two-reactor fermentation system was shown to be an alternative for conventional one-reactor repeated batch operation.",

Strain DQ8 was assigned to the genus Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on biochemical and genetic data.

P. aeruginosa DQ8 could also degrade PAHs of three or four aromatic rings. The metabolites identified from fluorene as substrate suggested that P. aeruginosa DQ8 may degrade fluorene via two pathways. One is monooxygenation at C-9 of fluorene, and the other is initiated by dioxygenation at C-3 and C-4 of fluorene. P. aeruginosa DQ8 should be of great practical significance both in bioremediation of oil-contaminated soils and biotreatment of oil wastewater.",

The influences of aeration and pH were investigated to further improve the resistance of strain Na-2 against sodium lactate stress and to obtain the most efficient L-LA production process. Although mild aeration was favorable for cell growth and L-LA production, vigorous aeration resulted in a metabolic shift from homolactic to mixed-acid/acetoin fermentation. Therefore, a two-stage aeration control strategy was employed. Optimum pH was found to be 6.0. A total of 106.0 g/l L-LA was produced in 30 h by Bacillus sp. Na-2 using sodium hydroxide as neutralizing agent. Productivity, conversion rate and optical purity were 3.53 g/l/h, 94% and 99.5%, respectively. The remarkable fermentation traits of Bacillus sp. Na-2 and the environment-friendly characteristics of NaOH-based process represent new insight for industrial scale production of L-LA.",

Solvent-tolerant microorganisms are useful in biotransformation with whole cells in biphasic reactions. A solvent-tolerant desulfurizing bacterium, Pseudomonas putida A4, was constructed by introducing the biodesulfurizing gene cluster dszABCD, which was from Rhodococcus erythropolis XP, into the solvent-tolerant strain P. putida Idaho. Biphasic reactions were performed to investigate the desulfurization of various sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds in the presence of various organic solvents. P. putida A4 had the same substrate range as R. erythropolis XP and could degrade dibenzothiophene at a specific rate of 1.29 mM g (dry weight) of cells(-1) h(-1) for the first 2 h in the presence of 10% (vol/vol) p-xylene. P. putida A4 was also able to degrade dibenzothiophene in the presence of many other organic solvents at a concentration of 10% (vol/vol). This study is a significant step in the exploration of the biotechnological potential of novel biocatalysts for developing an efficient biodesulfurization process in biphasic reaction mixtures containing toxic organic solvents.",

Here, we determined the genome sequences of five B. coagulans strains, and used a comparative genomic approach to reconstruct the central carbon metabolism of this species to explain their fermentation features. A novel xylose isomerase in the xylose utilization pathway was identified in these strains. Based on a genome-wide positive selection scan, the selection pressure on amino acid metabolism may have played a significant role in the thermal adaptation. We also researched the immune systems of B. coagulans strains, which provide them with acquired resistance to phages and mobile genetic elements. Our genomic analysis provides comprehensive insights into the genetic characteristics of B. coagulans and paves the way for improving and extending the uses of this species.",

        "abstract": "Mesophilic \u03b1-amylase from Flavobacteriaceae (FSA) is evolutionary closely related to thermophilic archaeal Pyrococcus furiosus \u03b1-amylase (PWA), but lacks the high thermostability, despite the conservation of most residues involved in the two-metal (Ca, Zn) binding center of PWA. In this study, a disulfide bond was introduced near the two-metal binding center of FSA (designated mutant EH-CC) and this modification resulted in a slight improvement in thermostability. As expected, E204G mutations in FSA and EH-CC led to the recovery of Ca-binding site. Interestingly, both Ca- and Zn-dependent thermostability were significantly enhanced; 153.1% or 50.8% activities was retained after a 30-min incubation period at 50\u2009\u00b0C, in the presence of Ca or Zn. The C214S mutation, which affects Zn-binding, also remarkably enhanced Zn- and Ca- dependent thermostability, indicating that Ca- and Zn-binding sites function cooperatively to maintain protein stability. Furthermore, an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis revealed a novel Zn-binding site in mutant EH-CC-E204G. This metal ion cooperation provides a possible method for the generation of \u03b1-amylases with desired thermal properties by in silico rational design and systems engineering, to generate a Zn-binding site adjacent to the conserved Ca-binding site.",

        "abstract": "Glutarate is a five carbon platform chemical produced during the catabolism of L-lysine. It is known that it can be catabolized through the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenation pathway. Here, we discover that Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has an additional glutarate catabolic pathway involving L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG), an abnormal metabolite produced from 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG). In this pathway, CsiD, a Fe/2-KG-dependent glutarate hydroxylase, is capable of converting glutarate into L-2-HG, and LhgO, an L-2-HG oxidase, can catalyze L-2-HG into 2-KG. We construct a recombinant strain that lacks both glutarate catabolic pathways. It can produce glutarate from L-lysine with a yield of 0.85\u2009mol glutarate/mol L-lysine. Thus, L-2-HG anabolism and catabolism is a metabolic alternative to the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenation pathway in P. putida KT2440; L-lysine can be both ketogenic and glucogenic.",

        "abstract": " is a very large bacterial genus, in which several species can use D-malate for growth. However, the enzymes that can metabolize D-malate, such as D-malate dehydrogenase, appear to be absent in most  species. D-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SerA) can catalyze the production of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) from 2-ketoglutarate to support D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenation, which is the initial reaction in bacterial L-serine biosynthesis. In this study, we show that SerA of the  stutzeri strain A1501 reduces oxaloacetate to D-malate and that D-2-HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) from  displays D-malate oxidizing activity. Of note, D2HGDH participates in converting a trace amount of D-malate to oxaloacetate during bacterial L-serine biosynthesis. Moreover, D2HGDH is crucial for the utilization of D-malate as the sole carbon source for growth of  A1501. We also found that the D2HGDH expression is induced by the exogenously added D-2-HG or D-malate and that a flavoprotein functions as a soluble electron carrier between D2HGDH and electron transport chains to support D-malate utilization by  These results support the idea that D2HGDH evolves as an enzyme for both D-malate and D-2-HG dehydrogenation in  In summary, D2HGDH from  A1501 participates in both a core metabolic pathway for L-serine biosynthesis and utilization of extracellular D-malate.",

Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is one of the most widely studied rhizosphere-dwelling model organisms. The P. putida KT2440 genome contains an NAD-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase encoding gene, but mutation of this gene does not play a role in d-lactate utilization. Instead, it was found that d-lactate utilization in P. putida KT2440 proceeds via a multidomain NAD-independent d-lactate dehydrogenase with a C-terminal domain containing several Fe-S cluster-binding motifs (Fe-S d-iLDH) and glycolate oxidase, which is widely distributed in various microorganisms. Both Fe-S d-iLDH and glycolate oxidase were identified to be membrane-bound proteins. Neither Fe-S d-iLDH nor glycolate oxidase is constitutively expressed but both of them can be induced by either enantiomer of lactate in P. putida KT2440. This study shows a case in which an environmental microbe contains two types of enzymes specific for d-lactate utilization.",

Lactate could be separated from corn steep water at a low cost, which supports the value-added utilization of corn steep water. However, the racemic characteristic of lactate from corn steep water restricts the development of this promising process. In this study, using d-lactate oxidase (d-LOX) from Gluconobacter oxydans, l-lactate oxidase (l-LOX) from Pediococcus sp., pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis, and catalase from bovine liver, we synthesized an in vitro enzymatic system, including different enzymatic cascades, for the production of valuable platform chemicals from lactate separated from the corn steep water. Pyruvate was produced as an important intermediate and further converted into C2 (acetaldehyde) and C4 (acetoin) platform chemicals at high yields using optimized concentrations of pyruvate decarboxylase.

        "abstract": "Bacterial membrane-associated NAD-independent d-lactate dehydrogenase (Fe-S d-iLDH) oxidizes d-lactate into pyruvate. Sequence analysis of the enzyme reveals that it contains a Fe-S oxidoreductase domain in addition to an FAD-containing dehydrogenase domain, which differs from other typical d-iLDHs. Fe-S d-iLDH from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was purified as a His-tagged protein and characterized in detail. This monomeric enzyme exhibited activities with l-lactate and several d-2-hydroxyacids. Quinone was shown to be the preferred electron acceptor of the enzyme. The two domains of the enzyme were then heterologously expressed and purified separately. The Fe-S cluster-binding motifs predicted by sequence alignment were preliminarily verified by site-directed mutagenesis of the Fe-S oxidoreductase domain. The FAD-containing dehydrogenase domain retains 2-hydroxyacid oxidizing activity although it was decreased. Compared to the intact enzyme, the FAD-containing dehydrogenase domain showed increased catalytic efficiency with cytochrome c as the electron acceptor, but completely lost the ability to use coenzyme Q10 Additionally, the FAD-containing dehydrogenase domain was no longer associated with the cell membrane, and it could not support the utilization of d-lactate as a carbon source. Based on the results obtained, we conclude that the Fe-S oxidoreductase domain functions as an electron transfer component to facilitate the utilization of quinone as an electron acceptor by Fe-S d-iLDH, and helps the enzyme to associate with cell membrane. These functions make the Fe-S oxidoreductase domain crucial for the in vivo d-lactate utilization function of Fe-S d-iLDH.IMPORTANCE Lactate metabolism plays versatile roles in most domains of life. Lactate utilization processes depend on certain enzymes to oxidize lactate to pyruvate. In recent years, novel bacterial lactate oxidizing enzymes have been continually reported, including the unique NAD-independent d-lactate dehydrogenase that contains a Fe-S oxidoreductase domain besides the typical flavin-containing domain (Fe-S d-iLDH). Although Fe-S d-iLDH is widely distributed among bacterial species, the investigation of it is insufficient. Fe-S d-iLDH from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which is the major d-lactate oxidizing enzyme for the strain, could be a representative of this type of enzyme. Study of it will be helpful in understanding the detailed mechanisms underlying the lactate utilization processes.",

Due to its biological and extensively studied genetic background, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is viewed as a promising host for construction of efficient biocatalysts. After analysis and reconstruction of the lactate utilization system in the P. putida strain, a novel biocatalyst that only exhibited NAD-independent D-lactate dehydrogenase activity was prepared and used in L-2-hydroxy-carboxylates production. Since the side reaction catalyzed by the NAD-independent L-lactate dehydrogenase was eliminated in whole cells of recombinant P. putida KT2440, two important L-2-hydroxy-carboxylates (L-lactate and L-2-hydroxybutyrate) were produced in high yield and high optical purity by kinetic resolution of racemic 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids. The results highlight the promise in biocatalysis by the biotechnologically important organism P. putida KT2440 through genomic analysis and recombination.",

Compared with wild-type D-nLDH, the Y52L mutant D-nLDH showed elevated activities toward unnatural substrates especially with large substitutes at C-3. By the biocatalysis combined with a formate dehydrogenase for in situ generation of NADH, the corresponding (R)-\u03b1-hydroxy carboxylic acids could be produced at high yields and highly optical purities. Taking the production of chiral (R)-phenyllactic acid (PLA) from PPA for example, 50\u2005mM PPA was completely reduced to (R)-PLA in 90\u2005min with a high yield of 99.0% and a highly optical purity (>99.9% e.e.) by the coupling system. The results presented in this work suggest a promising alternative for the production of chiral \u03b1-hydroxy carboxylic acids.",

Exploiting an alternative route for glycerol utilization is significantly important for sustainability of biofuels.A novel biocatalyst that could be prepared from glycerol for producing 2-oxo-carboxylates was developed. First, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was reconstructed by deleting lldR to develop a mutant expressing the NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenases (iLDHs) constitutively. Then, the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) was heterologously expressed to further improve the biotransformation activity. The reconstructed strain, P. putida KT2440 (\u0394lldR)/pBSPPcGm-vgb, exhibited high activities of iLDHs when cultured with glycerol as the carbon source. This cost-effective biocatalyst could efficiently produce pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate from dl-lactate and dl-2-hydroxybutyrate with high molar conversion rates of 91.9 and 99.8 %, respectively.The process would not only be a promising alternative for the production of 2-oxo-carboxylates, but also be an example for preparation of efficient biocatalysts for the value-added utilization of glycerol.",

Chemical synthesis of benzofuran rings often requires expensive catalysts and stringent operational conditions. Biosynthesis is recognized as a promising way to save energy and produce valuable compounds. Dioxin biodegradation pathways can form several benzofuran derivatives, and these pathways may be a better choice for further synthesis of important biological compounds. 2-Hydroxy-4-(3\u2032-oxo-3\u2032H-benzofuran-2\u2032-yliden)but-2-enoic acid (HOBB), a benzofuran derivative, can be biosynthesized from dibenzofuran (DBF) through co-metabolic degradation in a lateral dioxygenation pathway.",

        "abstract": "Nicotine is an environmental toxicant in tobacco wastes, imposing severe hazards for the health of human and other mammalians. NicR2, a TetR-like repressor from Pseudomonas putida S16, plays a critical role in regulating nicotine degradation. Here, we determined the crystal structures of NicR2 and its complex with the inducer 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP). The N-terminal domain of NicR2 contains a conserved helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif, while the C-terminal domain contains a cleft for its selective recognition for HSP. Residues R91, Y114 and Q118 of NicR2 form hydrogen bonds with HSP, their indispensable roles in NicR2u0027s recognition with HSP were confirmed by structure-based mutagenesis combined with isothermal titration calorimetry analysis. Based on sequence alignment and structure comparison, Tyr67, Tyr68 and Lys72 of HTH motif were corroborated to take the major responsibility for DNA-binding using site-directed mutants. The 30-residue N-terminal extension of NicR2, especially residues 21\u201330 in the TFR arm, is required for the association with the operator DNA. Finally, we proposed that either NicR2 or the DNA would undergo a conformational change upon their association. Altogether, our structural and biochemical investigations unravel how NicR2 selectively recognizes HSP and DNA, and provide new insights into the TetR family of repressors.

        "abstract": "Previous research suggested that Pseudomonas spp. may attack the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine in a way similar to mammalian metabolism, resulting in the formation of pseudooxynicotine, the direct precursor of a potent tobacco-specific lung carcinogen. In addition, the subsequent intermediates, 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (HSP) and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (DHP) in the Pseudomonas nicotine degradation pathway are two important precursors for drug syntheses. However, there is little information on the molecular mechanism for nicotine degradation via the pyrrolidine pathway until now. In this study we cloned and sequenced a 4,879-bp gene cluster involved in nicotine degradation. Intermediates N-methylmyosmine, pseudooxynicotine, 3-succinoylpyridine, HSP, and DHP were identified from resting cell reactions of the transformant containing the gene cluster and shown to be identical to those of the pyrrolidine pathway reported in wild-type strain Pseudomonas putida S16. The gene for 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase (HSP hydroxylase) catalyzing HSP directly to DHP was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified HSP hydroxylase (38 kDa) is NADH dependent. DNA sequence analysis of this 936-bp fragment reveals that the deduced amino acid shows no similarity with any protein of known function.",

In this study, an isolated strain, S16, identified as Pseudomonas putida biotype A, was used to investigate nicotine degradation. Possible intermediates were identified based on the results of NMR, Fourier-transform (FT)-IR and UV spectroscopy, GC-MS and high-resolution MS (HR-MS) analysis. The pathway of nicotine degradation in P. putida was proposed to be from nicotine to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine through the intermediates N-methylmyosmine, 2'-hydroxynicotine, pseudooxynicotine, 3-pyridinebutanal,C-oxo, 3-succinoylpyridine and 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine. N-Methylmyosmine, 2,5-dihydroxypyridine and succinic acid were detected and satisfactorily verified for the first time as intermediates of nicotine degradation. In addition, an alcohol compound, 1-butanone,4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridinyl), was found to be a novel product of nicotine degradation. These findings provide new insights into the microbial metabolism of nicotine and the environmentally friendly route of nicotine degradation.",

        "abstract": "There are quite a few ongoing biochemical investigations of nicotine degradation in different organisms. In this work, we identified and sequenced a gene (designated nicA) involved in nicotine degradation by Pseudomonas putida strain S16. The gene product, NicA, was heterologously expressed and characterized as a nicotine oxidoreductase catalyzing the initial steps of nicotine metabolism. Biochemical analyses using resting cells and the purified enzyme suggested that nicA encodes an oxidoreductase, which converts nicotine to 3-succinoylpyridine through pseudooxynicotine. Based on enzymatic reactions and direct evidence obtained using H(2)(18)O labeling, the process may consist of enzyme-catalyzed dehydrogenation, followed by spontaneous hydrolysis and then repetition of the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis steps. Sequence comparisons revealed that the gene showed 40% similarity to genes encoding NADH dehydrogenase subunit I and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I in eukaryotes. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular mechanism for nicotine degradation in strain S16 involves the pyrrolidine pathway and is similar to the mechanism in mammals, in which pseudooxynicotine, the direct precursor of a potent tobacco-specific lung carcinogen, is produced.",

Emulsification before methanolysis improved the reaction rate. The lipase-nanoparticle biocomposite showed high activity and stability in the single-packed-bed reactor at an optimal flow rate (0.25 mL min(-1)). After 240 h of reaction, the conversion rate was sustained as high as 45%. The conversion rate and stability achieved using the four-packed-bed reactor were much higher than those achieved using the single-packed-bed reactor. The conversion of biodiesel was maintained at a high rate of over 88% for 192 h, and it only slightly declined to approximately 75% after 240 h of reaction. The packed-bed reactor system, therefore, has a great potential for achieving the design and operation of enzymatic biodiesel production on the industrial scale.",

        "abstract": "Anaerobic fermentation using lignocellulosic hydrolysates as co-substrates is an economically attractive method to enhance 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production by increasing the conversion yield from glycerol. Lignocellulosic hydrolysates contain the mixed sugars that are primarily glucose, xylose, and arabinose. Therefore, these three individual sugars were used, separately, as co-substrates with glycerol, in 1,3-PD production by a Clostridium diolis strain DSM 15410, resulting in an 18%-28% increase in the 1,3-PD yield. Co-fermentation of the mixed sugars and glycerol obtained a higher intracellular NADH/NAD(+) ratio and increased the 1,3-PD yield by 22% relative to fermentation of glycerol alone. Thereafter, two kinds of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, corn stover hydrolysate and corncob molasses, were individually co-fermented with glycerol. The maximum 1,3-PD yield from glycerol reached 0.85\u2009mol/mol. Fed-batch co-fermentation was also performed, improving the 1,3-PD yield (from 0.62\u2009mol/mol to 0.82\u2009mol/mol). These results demonstrate that the co-fermentation strategy is an efficient and economical way to produce 1,3-PD from glycerol.",

In this study, cofactor engineering was applied to improve the efficiency of (2S,3S)-2,3-BD production and simplify the product purification. Two NADH regeneration enzymes, glucose dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), were introduced into Escherichia coli with 2,3-BD dehydrogenase, respectively. Introduction of FDH resulted in higher (2S,3S)-2,3-BD concentration, productivity and yield from diacetyl, and large increase in the intracellular NADH concentration. In fed-batch bioconversion, the final titer, productivity and yield of (2S,3S)-2,3-BD on diacetyl reached 31.7\u2005g/L, 2.3\u2005g/(L\u00b7h) and 89.8%, the highest level of (2S,3S)-2,3-BD production thus far. Moreover, cosubstrate formate was almost totally converted to carbon dioxide and no organic acids were produced. The biocatalytic process presented should be a promising route for biotechnological production of NADH-dependent microbial metabolites.",

        "abstract": "Biotechnological production of biofuels is restricted by toxicity of the products such as ethanol and butanol. As its low toxicity to microbes, 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD), a fuel and platform bio-chemical, could be a promising alternative for biofuel production from renewable bioresources. In addition, no bacterial strains have been reported to produce enantiopure 2,3-BD using lignocellulosic hydrolysates. In this study, Enterobacter cloacae strain SDM was systematically and metabolically engineered to construct an efficient biocatalyst for production of the fuel and enantiopure bio-chemical-(2R,3R)-2,3-BD. First, the various (2R,3R)-2,3-BD dehydrogenase encoding genes were expressed in a meso-2,3-BD dehydrogenase encoding gene disrupted E. cloacae strain under native promoter Pb of the 2,3-BD biosynthetic gene cluster of E. cloacae. Then, carbon catabolite repression was eliminated via inactivation of the glucose transporter encoding gene ptsG and overexpression of a galactose permease encoding gene galP. The resultant strain could utilize glucose and xylose simultaneously. To improve the efficiency of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD production, the byproduct-producing genes (ldh and frdA) were knocked out, thereby enhancing the yield of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD by 16.5% in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. By using fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor, 152.0 g/L (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (purity&amp;gt;97.5%) was produced within 44 h with a specific productivity of 3.5 g/[Lh] and a yield of 97.7% from a mixture of glucose and xylose, two major carbohydrate components in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. In addition, when a lignocellulosic hydrolysate was used as the substrate, 119.4 g/L (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (purity&amp;gt;96.0%) was produced within 51 h with a productivity of 2.3g/[Lh] and a yield of 95.0%. These results show that the highest records have been acquired for enantiopure (2R,3R)-2,3-BD production by a native or engineered strain from biomass-derived sugars. In addition to producing the 2,3-BD, our systematic approach might also be used in the production of other important chemicals by using lignocellulose-derived sugars.",

This study aimed to provide a new way for bacterial production of an acetylated diol, i.e. acetylbutanediol (ABD, 3,4-dihydroxy-3-methylpentan-2-one), by acetoin metabolism.When Bacillus pumilus ATCC 14884 was aerobically cultured in a chemically defined medium with acetoin as the sole carbon and energy source, ABD was produced and identified by gas chromatography--chemical ionization mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.Although the key enzyme leading to ABD from acetoin has not been identified yet at this stage, this study proposed a new metabolic pathawy to produce ABD in vivo from using renewable resources--in this case acetoin, which could be reproduced from glucose in this study--making it the first facility in the world to prepare this new bio-based diol product.",

        "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic heterocycles, such as carbazole, are environmental contaminants suspected of posing human health risks. In this study, we investigated the degradation of carbazole by immobilized Sphingomonas sp. strain XLDN2-5 cells. Four kinds of polymers were evaluated as immobilization supports for Sphingomonas sp. strain XLDN2-5. After comparison with agar, alginate, and kappa-carrageenan, gellan gum was selected as the optimal immobilization support. Furthermore, Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles were prepared by a coprecipitation method, and the average particle size was about 20 nm with 49.65-electromagnetic-unit (emu) g(-1) saturation magnetization. When the mixture of gellan gel and the Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles served as an immobilization support, the magnetically immobilized cells were prepared by an ionotropic method. The biodegradation experiments were carried out by employing free cells, nonmagnetically immobilized cells, and magnetically immobilized cells in aqueous phase. The results showed that the magnetically immobilized cells presented higher carbazole biodegradation activity than nonmagnetically immobilized cells and free cells. The highest biodegradation activity was obtained when the concentration of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles was 9 mg ml(-1) and the saturation magnetization of magnetically immobilized cells was 11.08 emu g(-1). Additionally, the recycling experiments demonstrated that the degradation activity of magnetically immobilized cells increased gradually during the eight recycles. These results support developing efficient biocatalysts using magnetically immobilized cells and provide a promising technique for improving biocatalysts used in the biodegradation of not only carbazole, but also other hazardous organic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms. The excretion of acetoin, which can be diagnosed by the Voges Proskauer test and serves as a microbial classification marker, has its vital physiological meanings to these microbes mainly including avoiding acification, participating in the regulation of NAD/NADH ratio, and storaging carbon. The well-known anabolism of acetoin involves alpha-acetolactat synthase and alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase; yet its catabolism still contains some differing views, although much attention has been focused on it and great advances have been achieved. Current findings in catabolite control protein A (CcpA) mediated carbon catabolite repression may provide a fuller understanding of the control mechanism in bacteria. In this review, we first examine the acetoin synthesis pathways and its physiological meanings and relevancies; then we discuss the relationship between the two conflicting acetoin cleavage pathways, the enzymes of the acetoin dehydrogenase enzyme system, major genes involved in acetoin degradation, and the CcpA mediated acetoin catabolite repression pathway; in the end we discuss the genetic engineering progresses concerning applications. To date, this is the first integrated review on acetoin metabolism in bacteria, especially with regard to catabolic aspects. The apperception of the generation and dissimilation of acetoin in bacteria will help provide a better understanding of microbial strategies in the struggle for resources, which will consequently better serve the utilization of these microbes.",

        "abstract": "Blood lead poisoning has become an important problem because of its serious effects on human health. Yet a solution has not become apparent due to the incomplete understanding of existing state of lead ions in blood. Based on the fact that most of blood lead binds to hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells (RBCs), identifying and capturing lead-contaminated Hb in RBCs is rather important. In this work, one blood lead magnetic remover with hyperbranched poly(amido amine)s (HPAM) as template/co-adsorbent and core-shell mesoporous structure synthesized by in situ method was proposed. Lead-containing Hb was selectively captured and then fixed by mesoporous channels. The magnetic separation technology was used to separate the magnetic remover from blood. Then a capture-fix-separate mechanism was proposed in this work for the first time. A related blood lead clean-up apparatus was used to remove blood lead in vivo for pig. Results of physical/chemical characterizations, biocompatibility experiments, animal tests and theoretical simulation verify the safety and efficiency of the blood lead removal strategy we proposed and the high efficiency of related blood lead clean-up apparatus (removal ratio of animal test: 75%/50 min).",

Finally, it is proved by in vitro blood tests that the coronary stent decorated with VE-Cad loaded-amphoteric copolymer displayed good platelet anti-adhesion characteristic.

        "abstract": "Two NhaD-type antiporters, NhaD1 and NhaD2, from the halotolerant and alkaliphilic  sp. strain Y2, exhibit different physiological functions in regard to Na and Li resistance, although they share high sequence identity. In the present study, the truncation of an additional 4 C-terminal residues from NhaD2 or an exchange of 39 N-terminal residues between these proteins resulted in the complete loss of antiporter activity. Interestingly, combining 39 N-terminal residues and 7 C-terminal residues of NhaD2 (N39D2-C7) partially recovered the activity for Na and Li expulsion, as well as complementary growth following exposure to 300 mM Na and 100 mM Li stress. The recovered activity of chimera N39D2-C7 indicated that the N and C termini are structurally dependent on each other and function synergistically. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis suggested that the N and C termini are relatively close in proximity which may account for their synergistic function in ion translocation. In the N-terminal region of N39D2-C7, the replacement of Glu with Pro abolished the recovered complementary and transport activities. In addition, this amino acid substitution in NhaD2 resulted in a drastically decreased complementation ability in  KNabc (level identical to that of NhaD1), as well as decreased activity and an altered pH profile. Limited information on NhaD antiporters supports speculation that these antiporters are important for resistance to high salinity and alkalinity. Moreover, only a few functional residues have been identified in NhaD antiporters, and there is limited literature on the molecular mechanisms of NhaD antiporter activity. The altered antiporter abilities of chimeras and mutants in this study implicate the functions of the N and C termini, especially Glu, in pH regulation and ion translocation, and, most importantly, the essential roles of this negatively charged residue in maintaining the physiological function of NhaD2. These findings further our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NhaD antiporters for ion transport.",

        "abstract": "NhaD-type antiporters are mainly distributed in various , especially in marine microorganisms and human pathogens. This distribution as well as the pathogenic properties of these strains suggest that these antiporters contribute to the regulation of high osmoregulation and are potential drug targets. Two NhaD homologs, NhaD1 and NhaD2, from the halotolerant and alkaliphilic  sp. Y2 exhibits similar, high  activity, but remarkably different  functions. To search for critical domains or residues involved in these differences of physiological functions, various chimeras composed of NhaD1 and NhaD2 segments were generated. Two regions at residues 1-67 and 464-492 were found to be responsible for the robust  function of NhaD2, and region 464-492 is also crucial to the pH response of the antiporter. In particular, the completely abolished activity of KNabc/N463r, highly recovered activity while very weakly recovered ion resistance of the KNabc/N463r-C7 chimera, suggested that transmembrane helix (TM) XIII is crucial for the robust ion resistance of NhaD2. Using site-directed mutagenesis, seven hydrophobic residues in TM XIII were identified as key residues for the ion translocation of NhaD2. Compared with the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) profile in the wild-type NhaD2, the reduced FRET efficiency of N463r chimeras provided solid evidence for conformational changes in the N463r fusion protein and consequently verified the structural functions of TM XIII in the pH activation and physiological functions of NhaD2.",

Halomonas hydrothermalis Y2 is a halotolerant and alkaliphilic strain that isolated from the Na-rich pulp mill wastewater. The strain is dominant in the bacterial community of pulp mill wastewater and exhibits metabolic diversity in utilizing various substrates. Here we present the genome sequence of this strain, which comprises a circular chromosome 3,933,432 bp in size and a GC content of 60.2%. Diverse genes that encoding proteins for compatible solutes synthesis and transport were identified from the genome. With a complete pathway for ectoine synthesis, the strain could produce ectoine from monosodium glutamate and further partially secreted into the medium. In addition, around 20% ectoine was increased by deleting the ectoine hydroxylase (EctD). The genome sequence we report here will provide genetic information regarding adaptive mechanisms of strain Y2 to its harsh habitat, as well as facilitate exploration of metabolic strategies for diverse compatible solutes, e.g., ectoine production.",

In this study, two NhaD homologues that effectively catalyze Na(+)/H(+) antiporter were identified from Halomonas sp. Y2, a halotolerant and alkaliphilic strain isolated from sodium enriched black liquor. They exhibited high sequence identity of 72\u00a0% and similar binding affinities for Na(+) and Li(+) translocation, while having different pH profiles. Ha-NhaD1 was active at pH 6.0 and most active at pH 8.0-8.5, whereas Ha-NhaD2 lacked activity at pH 6.0 but exhibited maximum activity at pH 9.5 or higher. Based on multiple alignments, 11 partially conserved residues were selected and corresponding mutants were generated for Ha-NhaD1. As expected, replacement of most of the hydrophobic residues abolished the cation exchange activities. Three serine residues at positions 200, 282 and 353 in Ha-NhaD1 were replaceable by alanines with partial retention of activity. The S353A mutant exhibited significantly reduced binding affinity for Na(+) and Li(+), while S282 mutant exhibited an alkaline shift of about 1.5 pH units, as compared to the wild type Ha-NhaD1. Serine at position 282 was predicted to be located in transmembrane segment VIII and was found to be important in regulating pH sensitivity in concert with flanking residues. ",

        "abstract": "The production of chemicals with chiral groups through chemical methods is attractive but difficult to perform. Optically active 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) can provide two chiral groups and has special applications in asymmetric synthesis. However, the chemical production of 2,3-BD from nonrenewable resources is expensive to perform and results in a mixture of three stereoisomeric forms. Enantiopure 2,3-BD production through green biotechnological routes is thus rather desirable. In this work, we introduced a \u201cSAME\u201d (Screening, Analysis, Mutation, and Evaluation) process to achieve efficient microbes for chiral chemicals\u2019 production using 2,3-BD as a target molecule. Bacillus licheniformis MW3, a GRAS and thermophilic strain, was firstly selected as a promising host. The mechanism of stereoisomer formation of 2,3-BD in B. licheniformis MW3 was then investigated. Two stereospecific 2,3-BD dehydrogenases (BDHs), 2R,3R-BDH (encoded by gdh) and meso-BDH (encoded by budC), were identified to be responsible for the production of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD and meso-2,3-BD. Two metabolically engineered strains, B. licheniformis MW3 (\u0394budC) and B. licheniformis MW3 (\u0394gdh), were constructed for the production of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD and meso-2,3-BD, respectively. After 42 h of fermentation, 123.7 g L\u22121 (2R,3R)-2,3-BD was synthesized using B. licheniformis MW3 (\u0394budC); while 90.1 g L\u22121meso-2,3-BD was synthesized after 32 h using B. licheniformis MW3 (\u0394gdh). Because of their high levels of production and biosecurity, these engineered B. licheniformis strains might have potential in the commercial production of enantiopure (2R,3R)-2,3-BD and meso-2,3-BD. The contracted but effective \u201cSAME\u201d process might serve as an alternative method for other chiral chemicals\u2019 production.",

The lateral confining pressure was kept at constant values of 0MPa, 4MPa, 8MPa, 12MPa, 16MPa, respectively and the strain rates were 10-5/s, 10-4/s and 10-3/s, respectively. The effect of strain rate and confining pressure on the strength and deformation of concrete were investigated systematically. From the test results it was revealed that the ultimate strength increased significantly as the confining pressure increased, and the increase in strain at peak stress was even more pronounced. At lower confining pressure, the ultimate strength increased definitely with the increasing strain rate, but the strength increment tended to become smaller at higher confinement; particularly when the confining pressures was higher than the quasi-static uniaxial compressive strength, the rate-dependent effect tended to diminish. The complete stress-strain curves at different strain rates were obtained.",

In this method, IEM was introduced to simulate the boundary conditions at infinitely distant position and NEM is used for simulating the region within boundary. The corresponding analysis program is compiled with the adoption of Laplace interpolation for NEM. An example of deeply buried circle tunnel is employed to test the correction and validation of the coupling analysis method. The results showed that compared with single NEM the calculation precision is manifestly improved and even for a relatively small computational domain, the calculation results meeting engineering requirements can still be obtained using the coupling method, which means less computational cost and more powerful capacity of solving underground engineering problems for the coupling method of NEM and IEM.",

The results indicate that permeability has larger difference, which may reach 1-2 order of magnitude; the two opposite regularities of dynamic variation of coal reservoirs permeability are presented between experimental simulation and numerical simulation; that is to say, numerical simulation permeability decreases with the decrease of fluid pressure; while experimental simulation permeability increases with the decrease of fluid pressure. Dynamic characteristics of permeability for two methods seem contradictory; but in fact interrelated. Coal reservoir permeability will be improved gradually during gas recovery. According to comparative analysis, the causes of differences between two methods are revealed. During the whole process, dynamic permeability index should be used to adjust and optimize the work system continuously.",

Based on the wave motion equation of nearly saturated soils obtained by Bardet according to the Biot's wave motion of saturated soil, the frequency characteristic equations of Rayleigh waves in a half-space of nearly saturated soils whether or not its surface is permeable to water are established. Some curves are drawn, such as, the curves of the ratio of the Rayleigh wave velocity to that of the shear wave and the real part of Rayleigh wave velocity versus normalized frequencies, and the curves of the normalized vertical and horizontal displacements of the soil skeleton and the fluid, the ratios of displacements in a certain depth of the nearly saturated soils to those of the saturated soils surface versus the normalized depth, i.e., the ratio of the depth to Rayleigh wave length. By analyzing these curves, some important conclusions are obtained that the saturation degree has important influences on the propagation characteristics of the Rayleigh wave in nearly saturated soils. If the saturation degree increases, the ratio of the Rayleigh wave velocity to that of the shear wave and the real part of the velocity Rayleigh increase, while the normalized vertical and horizontal displacements of the soil skeleton and the fluid decrease; but when the saturation degree increases from 95% to 99% their amplitude changes are less than those when it increases from 99% to 100%. These conclusions provide a theoretical basis for study on propagation characteristics, in-situ testing and data analysis of Rayleigh waves.",

        "abstract": "The natural element method (NEM) has advantages of both FEM and meshless method and is a promising numerical method for complex geotechnical engineering. The basic theory of NEM and infinite element method (IEM) was introduced. In order to overcome the defect that the errors are inevitably caused by selecting a certain finite region and setting the boundary conditions subjectively when treating infinite or half infinite domain problem in geotechnical engineering using NEM, the IEM was applied to simulate the boundary conditions at infinitely distant place, thus the coupling analysis method of NEM and IEM was provided. Combining with visco-elastical theory, the 2D visco-elastical analysis program based on the coupling method of NEM and IEM with Laplace interpolation was presented. Through an example, the correctness of the computation method was proved. The results show that compared with single NEM, the coupling method greatly improves the calculation precision, and extends the application scope of NEM in geotechnical engineering.",

Methods: Those patients with colorectal cancer obstruction who were refractory to medical treatment were treated by metal internal stents placement via electronic colonoscope under the x-ray guidance,then observe the curative effect and the complication. Results: Twenty pantients underwent stent placement,among them,16 were male,4 were female.Age range from 27 to 78,average 59.21 years old.14 cases were rectal cancer,2 were sigmoid colon cancer,4 cases were recurrence of cancer of sigmoid colon combined with abdominal cavity metastasis after operation.The achievement ratio:all the 14 rectal obstruction patients were placed internal stent successfully once,the achievement ratio is 100%.Among six pantients with sigmoid colon obstruction,four were successfully placed stent one time,one failed to place the Domestically produced stent at the first time,then changed the imports and succeed,one failed,the achievement ratio was 83.33% and the total achievement ration was 95.00%.Effect:Once the placement of the stent,the feces flew out immediately,the symptom relieved 24 hours after the placement and the patients could turn to normal diets. Three days after operation we can see improvement of bowel obstruction on the x-ray plain film,the short-term effective power is 100%.12 cases turned to surgical intervention 3~7 days later after bowel preparation.11 cases underwent stage I radical resection,there were no complications such as infection,stomalleak etc;one case found widespread metastasis then close the abdomen.Four patients placed the stent as permanence alleviative treatment because of the relapse and abodominal metastasis;3 cases underwent permanence alleviative treatment because of important organ dysfunction and intolerance of surgical intervention.in the follow-up period,one of the eight patients underwent the permanence stent placement occurred bowel obstruction relapse 36 days after operation,CT indicated the obstruction of the stent,and then turn to surgical intervention,died 5 days later because of heart failure.one patient occurred bowel obstruction 62 days after the placement,CT indicated the widespread abodominal metastasis to other part of the bowel caused the obstruction and then died.One patients died of whole body failure 80 days later.Other five patients in the following 90~180 days the stents keep easy and smooth and the patients were fine.Complication:1 case occurred aggravated hematochezia after operation,after one week drug treatment turned to be fine and have no other complications. Conclusion: Metallic internal stent placement via endoscopy under X ray control to treat rectal and sigmoid cancer obstruction have higher successful rate,which is safe and have obvious short term effect.",

Thus, this study was designed to investigate the effect of H. pylori eradication on the expression of human telomerase RNA (hTR), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), c-myc and proliferation nuclear cell antigen (PCNA) in H. pylori associated chronic gastritis.hTR was determined by in situ hybridization, hTERT, c-myc and PCNA were detected by immunohistochemistry using stomach tissues obtained from 39 H. pylori-infected and 21 H. pylori-negative patients with chronic gastritis before and after H. pylori eradication therapy or treatment for symptom relief only.Levels of hTR, hTERT, c-myc and PCNA were significantly higher in H. pylori-infected mucosa (51.3%, 53.8%, 53.8% and 16.8 +/- 5.8, respectively) when compared to H. pylori-negative mucosa before therapy (19.0%, 23.8%, 28.6%, 8.8 +/- 3.4, respectively; P < 0.05 in all cases). In patients with successful eradication of H. pylori the levels of hTR, hTERT, c-myc and PCNA (55.5%, 59.3%, 59.3%, 16.8 +/- 5.8, respectively) were significantly reduced after the therapy (22.2%, 22.2%, 14.8%, 7.0 +/- 5.0, respectively; P < 0.05 in all cases). In the H. pylori failed eradication and H. pylori-negative groups, there was no statistical difference in all four measurements.H. pylori infection may induce the overexpression of hTR, hTERT, c-myc and stimulate cell proliferation. Eradication of H. pylori may reverse the aberrant expression of these oncoproteins and thus correct the abnormal cell proliferation.",

[Methods] One hundred and four patients with esophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis were assigned into three groups: thirty-eight patients were treated by EVS, forty patients by EVL and twenty-six patients by EVLS. The rate of variceal eradication, rebleeding varices recurrence, complication and death were observed during the regular follow-up. [Results] The variceal eradication rate was similar in the three groups (EVS:81.6%, EVL:85.7%, EVLS:92.3%, P >0.05). The mean session of treatment to obtain eradication in the EVL group was lower than others (EVL: 1.8\u00b10.6, EVS: 3.0\u00b11.0, EVLS: 2.9\u00b11.0, P <0.05). In the EVLS group, the mean band of ligation was lower than the EVL group (7.3\u00b13.0 vs 11.0\u00b13.0, P <0.05), and the mean dosage of injection was lower than the EVS group (20.2\u00b110.7 vs 52.9\u00b125.6, P <0.05). There was not statistically significant difference in comparison of the rebleeding rate and death rate among the three groups. The rate of complication in the EVLS group was significantly lower than the EVS group (19.2% vs 32.7%, P <0.05), and similar with the EVL group (19.2% vs 15.1%, P >0.05). The rate of varices recurrence in the EVLS group was the lowest among the three groups. [Conclusions] The rate of varices recurrence and complication in the EVLS group were lower than the other groups , and to the patients with severe esophageal variceal especially, its operation safety was significant higher. So the EVLS methed is the optimal methed for the treatment of EVB.",

        "abstract": "Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), one of the most widely distributed serine endopeptidases, is highly expressed in the ovaries. However, the physiological role of POP in the ovaries is not clear. In this study, we investigated the significance of POP in the corpus luteum. Murine luteal cells were cultured in vitro and treated with a POP selective inhibitor, (2S)-1[[(2 S)-1-(1-oxo-4-phenylbutyl)-2-pyrrolidinyl carbonyl]-2-pyrrolidinecarbonitrile (KYP-2047). We found that KYP-2047 treatment decreased progesterone secretion. In contrast, POP overexpression increased progesterone secretion. Three essential steroidogenic enzymes, including p450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A), 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD), and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), were regulated by POP. Further studies showed that POP overexpression increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increased the expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), while KYP-2047 treatment decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and SF1 expression. To clarify the role of ERK1/2 signaling in POP-regulated progesterone synthesis, U0126-EtOH, an inhibitor of the ERK signaling pathway, was used to treat luteal cells. We found that U0126-EtOH decreased progesterone production and the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and SF1. POP overexpression did not reverse the effects of U0126-EtOH. Overall, POP regulates progesterone secretion by stimulating the expression of CYP11A, 3\u03b2-HSD, and StAR in luteal cells. ERK signaling and downstream SF1 expression contribute to this process.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To study the clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal polyps in the Nanchang area. Methods: We retrospectively investigated data from patients with colorectal polyps diagnosed by colonoscopy in our hospital from 1990 to 2004. Results: A total of 21,853 patients had undergone colonoscopy examination and colorectal polyps were diagnosed in 2,889 patients. The positive rate was 13.2%. Within the positive cases, the ratio of males to females was 1.8:1, the average age was 46.6\u00b116.5 years old, and the average age of male patients was older than that of the female patients (47.1\u00b117.5 vs. 45.5\u00b114.5, P<0.05). Forty-one percent of colorectal polyps detected were located in the rectum, and 27.7% were in the sigmoid colon. Colorectal polyps were located more often in the left side colon than in the right side colon (35.8% vs. 23.1%, P<0.05). Of the colorectal polyps detected, 67% were adenomas. The patients with juvenile polyps were the youngest (12\u00b14.8 years, P<0.05), and the patients with adenomatous polyps were the oldest (52\u00b114 years, P<0.05). By analyzing the clinicopathological characteristics of cases of colorectal polyps during the fifteen years involved in our study, we found that the detection rate of colorectal polyps, the average age of patients with colorectal polyps, and the incidence of adenomatous polyps increased, while the incidence of inflammatory and retention polyps decreased. Conclusion: Colorectal polyps are common and its incidence is higher in males than in females. Rectum and sigmoid colon are the most common sites. Juvenile and retention polyps occur mostly in young patients, and adenomatous polyps are found in adults. In recent years, the detection rate of colorectal polyps, the average age of patients with colorectal polyps, and the incidence of adenomatous polyps in the Nanchang area have increased, but the incidence of inflammatory and retention polyps has decreased.",

        "abstract": "The Notch signalling pathway in the mammalian ovary regulates granulosa cell proliferation. However, the effects of Notch signalling on steroidogenesis are unclear. In this study we cultured mouse ovarian granulosa cells from preantral follicles invitro and observed the effect of Notch signalling on steroidogenesis through overexpression, knockdown and inhibition of Notch signalling. Activation of Notch signalling decreased progesterone and oestrogen secretion. In contrast, inhibition of Notch signalling increased the production of progesterone and oestrogen. Expression of the genes for steroidogenic-related enzymes, including 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, p450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and aromatase, was repressed after stimulation of Notch signalling. The expression of upstream transcription factors, including steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), Wilms' tumour 1 (Wt1), GATA-binding protein 4 (Gata4) and Gata6, was also inhibited after stimulation of Notch signalling. Production of interleukin (IL)-6 was positively correlated with Notch signalling and negatively correlated with the expression of these transcription factors and enzymes. In conclusion, Notch signalling regulated progesterone and oestrogen secretion by affecting the expression of upstream transcription factors SF1, Wt1, Gata4 and Gata6, as well as downstream steroidogenic-related enzymes. IL-6, which may be regulated directly by Notch signalling, may contribute to this process. Our findings add to the understanding of the diverse functions of Notch signalling in the mammalian ovary.",

        "abstract": "Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI), a specific inhibitor of type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter, could regulate the extracellular adenosine concentration and have protective roles in seizures. However, the protection mechanism of NBTI in seizures remains poorly understood. Here, the expression pattern and subcellular distribution of adenosine A1 receptor were detected by Western blot analysis and double-labeling immunofluorescence staining in Lithium Chloride-Pilocarpine induced epileptic rat model. At 24 h after pilocarpine induced rat seizures, hippocampal slices were prepared and the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) amplitude of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus CA1 region was recorded using whole-cell patch clamp. In vivo, compared to control group, Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of adenosine A1 receptor protein was increased at 24 h and 72 h after seizure, didn't change at 0 min and 1 w, and decreased at 2 w. Double-label immunofluorescence revealed that adenosine A1 receptor was mainly expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm of neurons. In Vitro, adenosine decreased the eEPSCs amplitude of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus CA1 region, NBTI also had the same effect. Meantime, NBTI could further inhibit eEPSCs amplitude on the basis of lower concentration adenosine (50\u00b5M), and adenosine A1 receptor inhibitor DPCPX partially reversed this effect. Taken together, we confirmed that the expression of adenosine A1 receptor protein was increased in the early seizures and decreased in the late seizures. At the same time, NBTI mimics adenosine to attenuate the epileptiform discharge through adenosine A1 receptor, which might provide a novel therapeutic approach toward the control of epilepsy.",

        "abstract": "Seizures induce the release of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) from the intracellular fluid to the extracellular fluid, and the released EAAs primarily comprise glutamic acid (Glu) and asparaginic acid (Asp). Glu neurotransmission functions via EAA transporters (EAATs) to maintain low concentrations of Glu in the extracellular space and avoid excitotoxicity. EAAT2, the most abundant Glu transporter subtype in the central nervous system (CNS), plays a key role in the regulation of glutamate transmission. Previous studies have shown that SB203580 promotes EAAT2 expression by inhibiting the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, but whether SB203580 upregulates EAAT2 expression in epileptic rats is unknown. This study demonstrated that EAAT2 expression was increased in the brain tissue of epileptic rats. Intraperitoneal injection of a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, reduced the time to the first epileptic seizure and attenuated the seizure severity. In addition, SB203580 treatment increased the EAAT2 expression levels in the brain tissue of epileptic rats. These results suggest that SB203580 could regulate epileptic seizures via EAAT2.",

        "abstract": " We aimed to retrospectively analyze the clinical features, laboratory and imaging results, and predictors of poor prognosis for patients with an initial diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University.  Fifty patients with an initial diagnosis of AE who were admitted to our hospital from May 2014 to May 2018 were enrolled retrospectively. Clinical characteristics and experimental test data, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), were collected from medical records within 24 h of admission. Independent prognostic factors were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A good or poor prognosis for patients was defined based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The correlation between the immunotherapy latency and prognostic mRS score was determined using the Spearman rank correlation test.  Univariate analysis indicated that increased NLR ( = 0.001), decreased lymphocyte counts ( = 0.001), low serum albumin ( = 0.017), consciousness disorders ( = 0.001), epileptic seizures ( = 0.007), extrapyramidal symptoms ( = 0.042), abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings ( = 0.001), abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings ( = 0.003), and pulmonary infection complications ( = 0.000) were associated with the poor prognosis of AE. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR (odds ratio [OR] 2.169, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.029-4.570;  < 0.05) was an independent risk factor for predicting the poor prognosis of AE. NLR > 4.45 was suggested as the cut-off threshold for predicting the adverse outcomes of AE. In addition, we revealed that there was a positive correlation between immunotherapy latency and mRS score (r = 0.535,  < 0.05).  NLR may have predictive value for the poor outcomes of AE. Early initiation of immunotherapy is associated with a good prognosis.",

It was found that the positive rates for the existence of p24 nucleotide fragmemt of BDV both in PBMC and cerebrospinal fluids were 12.5% respectively and it was significantly higher than that of the control patients(0%),in which the Fisher test:\u03c72=4.524,P<0.05. The homologies of gene sequence of the aim gene fragment amplified by PCR with the standard virus strains V and H1766 supplied by NCB1 web station of GenBank were 95.35% and 9\u248f84% respectively. Four point mutations could be demonstrated in these loci(nt1649 T\u2192C;nt1656 G\u2192A,nt1670 C\u2192T;nt1676 C\u2192T)with a mutation rate of 4.65%.The aim gene fragment was found to be genetically related to the standard virus strain H1766. These results suggest that BDV infection really exists in patients with viral encephalitis in Zunyi and the surrounding regions of Guizhou province and it may be related to the onset of viral encephalitis.",

        "abstract": "Synaptophysin (SYP) and growth-associated binding protein 43 (GAP-43) have been shown to be closely related to hippocampal synaptic plasticity in recent years. They are important molecular markers associated with synaptic plasticity. However, the role of SYP and GAP-43 in chronic intermittent hypoxic injury of the central nervous system needs to be further clarified. In this study, 25 adult male sprague dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a normal control group (CON) and a chronic intermittent hypoxia group (CIH) with four time points as follows: 1 W, 2 W, 3 W, and 4 W. The behavioural changes (primarily learning and memory abilities) were observed by the Morris water maze in each group, consisting of 5 rats per group.The localization of SYP and GAP-43 in hippocampal CA1 neurons was observed, and the expression of SYP and GAP-43 in the hippocampus was detected by Western blotting. The results showed that the mean oxygen saturation of the tail artery in CIH rats was less than that in normal rats (P < 0.05). The escape latency of CIH rats was longer than that of normal rats, and the number of space exploration platform crossings was less than that of normal rats. SYP-positive stained cells were yellow or brown and were mainly expressed on the cell membrane, while the GAP-43-positive staining was brown and was mainly expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. The expression of SYP in plasma decreased gradually at the four time points for the CIH group (P < 0.05), while the expression of GAP-43 in the CIH 1W group increased (P < 0.05) and decreased gradually in the CIH 2 W, CIH 3 W and CIH 4 W groups (P < 0.05).",

        "abstract": "Objective To observe the effects of tran-resveratrol(TR) on hippocampus caspase12 mRNA and protein expressions in A\u03b225-35-induced dementia rats and further explore the anti-dementia mechanisms of trans-resveratrol.Methods Rats were randomly divided into sham,positive control(donepezil),model(A\u03b225-35),low-and high-dose of TR groups,respectively(n=9).After the injection of A\u03b225-35 into hippocampus,rats were administrated with 1.0 mg/kg donepezil and 10 and 40 mg/kg TR once daily by gavage for consecutive 15 days,while sham and model groups were administrated with volume-matched normal saline by gavage.After the final treatment,all the rats were sacrificed and caspase12 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting assay and caspase12 mRNA expression was detected by real time PCR in rat hippocampus.Results Compared with the sham group,A\u03b225-35 increased the protein and mRNA expressions of caspase12 in rat hippocampus(P<0.01).Compared with the model group,TR treatments significantly decreased the protein and mRNA expressions of caspase12 in rat hippocampus in dose-dependent manner(P<0.05).Conclusion The mechanisms underlying TR-mediated anti-dementia induced by A\u03b225-35 might be,at least partly,due to the decreased expression of caspase12 in rat hippocampus.",

Control group (Group A, without organ dysfunction or failure) were treated with sodium phosphate and enough water. Twenty three organ dysfunction patients were randomly assigned to group B (liquid diet for 3 d, less sodium phosphate and less water) and to group C (fasting 3 d and parenteral ali-mentation). Indicators including the comfort, enteric visibility and extensity of patients were observed.RESULTS: Group B and group C, which showed no significant difference between them-selves, had better comfort than group A dur-ing the examination. There was not significant difference in cleanness and visibility on CE in whole small bowel between group A and group B. Group C showed decreased visibility in low-er-half small bowel, but no difference in upper-half small bowel, compared with group A and B (12.6 \u00b1 3.6 vs 52.4 \u00b1 13.3, 46.6 \u00b1 8.1; 21.2 \u00b1 9.3 vs 46.4 \u00b1 11.2, 49.7 \u00b1 9.3, all P < 0.01).

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the changes of cellular Fas associated death domain-like IL-1\u03b2-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) expression after the inhibition of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation. METHODS: Human colon cancer cell line HT-29 was treated with 10, 20 and 40 nmol/L wortmannin (a specific inhibitor for Akt activation) for 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of HT-29 cells. After HT-29 cells were treated with 40 nmol/L wortmannin, the levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and c-FLIP protein were determined by Western blot, and the transcription of c-FLIP gene was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the 0, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th hour. RESULTS: Wortmannin suppressed the proliferation of HT-29 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). With the prolonging of treatment time, the level of pAkt protein expression was obviously decreased, while the expression of c-FLIP protein was also down-regulated, with decreased rates of 82% and 91% at the 24th hour, respectively. After wortmannin for 3 hours, the mRNA expression of c-FLIP was decreased to 40% of the control cells, and for 24 hours, it was decreased to 25% of the control ones. CONCLUSION: Wortmannin, a specific inhibitor for Akt activation, may inhibit the proliferation of HT-29 cells in vitro by down-regulation of c-FLIP gene.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the changes in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression after pioglitazone treatment in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: A total of 54 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly and averagely divided into 3 groups, named group A, C and I. Group A and C served as SAP model and sham operation group, respectively. The rats in group I were treated with pioglitazone, an agonist of peroxi- some proliferator activated receptor. The modi- fied Aho\u2019s method was used to reproduce SAP models, and the expression of ICAM-1 in pan- creatic tissues was determined by immunohisto-chemical staining. RESULTS: The histological examination re- vealed obvious necrosis, hemorrhage, as wel1 as inflammatory cell infiltration in pancreatic tissues after SAP model was induced, but the above pathological changes were alleviated in group I. After modeling, the expression of ICAM-1 was persistently increased from the 3rd hour. In group A, the expression of ICAM-1 was 0.73 \u00b1 0.27, 0.93 \u00b1 0.41, and 1.36 \u00b1 0.54 at the 3rd, 6th, and 12th hour, respectively, and there was significant difference between those at the 12th and 3rd hour (P < 0.05). In group I, ICAM-1 expression was 0.57 \u00b1 0.21, 0.86 \u00b1 0.40, and 0.80 \u00b1 0.53 at the 3rd, 6th, and 12th hour, respectively, and there was marked difference at the 12th hour between group A and I (P < 0.05). ICAM-1 ex- pression was weakly positive in group C, and faded away as the time increased. CONCLUSION: ICAM-1 is involved in the in- flammatory response of SAP, while pioglitazone can inhibit the expression of ICAM-1 in SAP.",

However, the regulatory roles of PI3K/Akt in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of wortmannin, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor, on SAP rats through exposure to sodium taurocholate (STC) after 3 h and 6 h. The SAP group was found to have a significant increase in pancreas Akt expression, along with the activation of serum amylase, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, and pancreas histological aggravation. The administration of wortmannin in SAP rats reduced Akt expression, attenuated the level of serum amylase and inflammation factor, and alleviated the damage of pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, the administration of wortmannin led to an obvious reduction in NF-\u03baB and p38MAPK expression in SAP rats. These findings showed that the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin decreases inflammatory cytokines in SAP rats and suggests its regulatory mechanisms may occur through the suppression on NF-\u03baB and p38MAPK activity.",

        "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3\u2011kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) has been indicated to serve an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. It was previously demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt inhibitor wortmannin alleviated the severity of inflammation and improved the survival rate in rats with induced severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), which indicates that PI3K/Akt may serve a role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. To date, the mechanism by which PI3K/Akt regulates inflammation has not been elucidated. In the present study, it was hypothesized that PI3K/Akt may be invovled in SAP inflammation via regulation of the Toll\u2011like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. Rats with SAP were treated with the PI3K/Akt agonist insulin\u2011like growth factor (IGF)\u20111, which alleviated the severity of inflammation in a dose\u2011dependent manner. Furthermore, to better understand the role of PI3K/Akt in inflammation, RAW264.7 murine macrophages were stimulated with IGF\u20111 and wortmannin alone or together before the induction of inflammation by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results indicated that LPS stimulated overexpression of TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), PI3K, Akt, p38MAPK and NF\u2011\u03baBp65 mRNA, and increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)\u20116 in RAW264.7 cells compared with the control group. The levels of all detected factors were increased by stimulation with IGF\u20111, whereas these levels were decreased following treatment with wortmannin alone, and the effect of IGF\u20111 was abolished by wortmannin in RAW264.7 cells. In\u00a0vivo studies indicated that IGF\u20111 produced the same anti\u2011inflammatory effect as wortmannin and that expression of TLR4, p38MAPK and NF\u2011\u03baBp65 decreased following treatment with IGF\u20111. These findings indicate that PI3K/Akt may take part in the progression of SAP by regulating the TLR4 signaling pathway and that IGF\u20111 can inhibit inflammation in SAP rats.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported the up-regulation of caspase recruitment domain 9 (CARD9) expressions in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients, but little is known about its regulation. In this study, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to reduce the levels of CARD9 expression in sodium taurocholate-stimulated SAP rats. CARD9 was overexpressed in SAP rats, which correlated with the severity of pancreatitis. When compared to the untreated group, the cohort that received the siRNA treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in pancreatic injury, neutrophil infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, siRNAs showed that the reduction of CARD9 in SAP rats down-regulated the expression of NF-\u03baBp65 and P38MAPK which are involved in the transcription and release of a wide variety of inflammatory cytokines. These findings provide evidence that CARD9 is up-regulated in SAP rats and acts as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment thereof. Blocking the activation of NF-\u03baB and P38MAPK via siRNA-mediated gene knock-down of CARD9 appears to reduce the inflammatory response in pancreatic tissue.",

        "abstract": "To determine the effect of pioglitazone, a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligand, on development of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the pancreas.Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (160-200 g) were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 18 in each group): severe acute pancreatitis group, pioglitazone group, sham group. SAP was induced by retrograde infusion of 1 mL/kg body weight 5% sodium taurocholate (STC) into the biliopancreatic duct of male SD rats. Pioglitazone was injected intraperitoneally two hours piror to STC infusion. Blood and ascites were obtained for detecting amylase and ascitic capacity. Pancreatic wet/dry weight ratio, expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 in pancreatic tissues were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Pancreatic tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for routine optic microscopy.Sham group displayed normal pancreatic structure. SAP group showed diffuse hemorrhage, necrosis and severe edema in focal areas of pancreas. There was obvious adipo-saponification in abdominal cavity. Characteristics such as pancreatic hemorrhage, necrosis, severe edema and adipo-saponification were found in pioglitazone group, but the levels of those injuries were lower in pioglitazone group than those in SAP group. The wet/dry pancreatic weight ratio, ascetic capacity, serum and ascitic activities of anylase in the SAP group were significantly higher than those in the sham group and pioglitazone group respectively (6969.50 +/- 1368.99 vs 2104.67 +/- 377.16, 3.99 +/- 1.22 vs 2.48 +/- 0.74, P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). According to Kusske criteria, the pancreatic histologic score showed that interstitial edema, inflammatory infiltration, parenchyma necrosis and parenchyma hommorrhage in SAP group significantly differed from those in the sham group and pioglitazone group (7.17 +/- 1.83 vs 0.50 +/- 0.55, 7.67 +/- 0.82 vs 6.83 +/- 0.75, P < 0.01, P < 0.05. The expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 in sham group was lower than that in SAP group and pioglitazone group (0.50 +/- 0.55 vs 33 +/- 1.21, P < 0.01). There was a significant difference in the expression of NF-kappaB and ICAM-1 between SAP group and pioglitazone group (7.50 +/- 1.05 vs 11.33 +/- 1.75, 0.80 +/- 0.53 vs 1.36 +/- 0.54, P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) at 12 h after the induction of pancreatitis.Pioglitazone attenuates the severity of SAP. The beneficial effect of pioglitazone is multifactorial due to its anti-inflammatory activities, most likely through the inhibition of ICAM-1 expression and NF-kappaB activation. Specific ligands of PPARgamma may represent the novel and effective means of clinical therapy for SAP.",

        "abstract": "To provide images of Earth interior and their temporal variations are main tasks for geophysicists.Comparing to our understanding of the static structure,we are still lacking in the understanding of the temporal variations of the subsurface.Recently,with the accumulation of observation data,repeated earthquakes and ambient noises are used to monitor subsurface changes.The resolutions and precisions of passive source monitoring are limited by the spatial and temporal distributions of sources.Monitoring subsurface changes with seismic wave generated by artificial sources naturally becames another goal to pursue.We systematically describe recent advances in active source monitoring at various scales.In this review,we also introduce cross-correlation based time delay estimation and its precision limitation.The precision of time delay estimation is limited by the repeatability of source,signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth of recorded signals.And seismic sources with large capacity and high repeatability are preferred for active monitoring.Advantages and disadvantages of different sources are compared in this review.According to the comparison,we suggest that the airgun source is superior to other sources for the purpose of active monitoring.Techniques as waveform stacking,coda wave interferometry and their application in active monitoring are also introduced.Waveform stacking can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and facilitate the phase identification.Coda wave travels longer and is more sensitive to subsurface changes than direct waves.Therefore,coda wave interferometry technique can be used to detect subtle variations.With the development of techniques for signal excitation,recording and processing,it is now possible to conduct large scale active subsurface monitoring.Relevant researches have broad potential applications to such fields as natural disaster mitigation and resource exploration.",

        "abstract": "An earthquake with a magnitude(ML) of 2.1 occurred at 16:40 UTC,October 12,2011,in the Shijingshan district in Beijing with an epicenter at 39.95\u00b0 N,116.16\u00b0 E.Eleven near-field strong motion stations,located less than 20 km from the epicenter,clearly recorded temporal variation of acceleration during the earthquake.The largest value of peak ground acceleration in the east-west(EW) and north-south(NS) components,22.528 gal and 30.989 gal,respectively,were both recorded by station LSG,which is situated approximately 5.6 km from epicenter.The largest value of peak ground acceleration in the vertical component was 12.797 gal,recorded by station CCS at an epicenter distance of 2.2 km.We synthesized the horizontal component by EW and NS records and used Generic Mapping Tools(GMT) software to mesh and illustrate the influence of horizontal and vertical acceleration on the field contour map.The results show that generally,the value of the NS component is larger than that of the EW component,and the horizontal component is larger than the vertical.Moreover,the acceleration distribution and influence field contour map of the horizontal component shows that peak ground acceleration in the southern area is a low value and that in the northern area is high.In addition,the two regions are divided by a transition zone that strikes near east-west(EW) or NEE.We obtained the average peak ground value of three components at 1 s intervals from station records after the earthquake occurred,which we synthesized into horizontal and vertical components to illustrate temporal variations in the map produced by GMT.After analyzing the average value records and temporal variation map,we detected that the decay in the NS direction is faster than that in the EW direction and that decay is faster in the vertical component than that in the horizontal component.Excepting the near-field strong motion stations,23 Capital Circle broadband digital seismic stations recorded digital waveform data during the earthquake.We interpreted initial P-wave polarity from these records and employed grid-point test method to obtain the Focal Mechanism Solution of the event.Results indicate normal faulting dominant in the Beijing-Tianjin area.The best double couple solution of the event is 295\u00b0,39\u00b0 and-74\u00b0 for strike,dip and rake angel,respectively;those of the other nodal plane are 96\u00b0,53\u00b0,and-102\u00b0 with a 13% inconsistency ratio.By combining these results with the acceleration analysis results,we determined that the strike of the second nodal plane with a larger dip angel is near the EW direction,which is consistent with the strike of acceleration transition zone.In addition,the microepicenter of the event does not coincide with the macroepicenter.These findings indicate that the nodal plane of strike 96\u00b0,dip 53\u00b0,and rake-102\u00b0may coincide with the seismogenic fault.Although the work in this study is a preliminary analysis for acceleration records and seismic digital waveform data,the results can provide a reference for quick determination of earthquake influence field and hazard assessment following a large earthquake and are highly significant for earthquake emergency response and disaster relief.",

It is found that tectonic stress action at hypocenter and vicinity intensifies before strong aftershock occurs, the variational range of stress tensor is not very large. After strong aftershock occurs, stress distributes afresh because of rupture. Furthermore, the consistence between the directions of tectonic stress field of source area and the direction of tectonic stress field in North China suggests that the Zhangbei mainshock and strong aftershocks all occurred under the action of tectonic stress field in North China.",

Based on 740 focal mechanism solutions of ML\u22652.5 earthquakes occurred during Jan. 1998 to Jan. 2009 in middle Xiaojiang fault and its adjacent area, the studied region was divided into sub-regions, and temporally further divided into phases with the larger earthquakes as boundary of the sub-regions. After removal of the larger earthquakes this paper inverted the focal mechanism data with the method of Gephart for the stress in main phase of each sub-region. The result indicates that the azimuth of maximum principal stress \u03c31 in 4 temporal phases of the sub-region A is approximately NNW-SSE, and in northern part of sub-region B are approximately NNW-SSE, WNW-ESE and ENE-WSW. The azimuth of \u03c3 in southern part of sub-region B is approximately NNW-SSE. The azimuth of \u03c31 in northern part of sub-region B changed significantly, while the azimuth of \u03c31 in sub-region A is relatively stable. This result may be related to the complicated structure and possible stress adjusting in northern sub-region B. The \u03c31 directions in sub-region A may indicate seismically relative stability of the central Yunnan crustal block.",

According to regional tectonic feature of middle section of Xiaojiang fault and its adjacent area,the research field is divided into two zones (A and B) along Xiaojiang fault ( the fault is included ) to make detailed study of the stress of Xiaojiang fault. An independent analysis is made on the Xiaojiang fault zone. 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grids with 0. 5\u00b0 slip trapeze zones are adopted in the study. The inversion of the stress fields in the zones with the method of FMSI shows that the fault's main strain-slip in middle section of Xiaojiang fault and its adjacent area is lateral,the A and B zones and the fault zone respectively have 81. 28% ,69. 23% and 72. 97% lateral fault. The stress inversion also indicated that the azimuth of maximum principal stress \u03c31 in A and B and the fault zone are respectively approximately NNW and NWW,the stress action is mainly horizontal,and strike-slip faulting is dominated in the study area. The 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grids with 0. 5\u00b0 slip trapeze in divided zone stress inversion shows that the direction change of principal stress field in central Yunnan block is NNW to NWW. However,in the region between Yuanmou fault and Pudu River fault,the azimuth of the main compressive stress shows that the North-South slip is obvious. While the azimuth of the main compressive stress of Xiaojiang fault zone is mainly NW,in the east of Xiaojiang fault,the direction of principal compressive stress about the eastern Yunnan block is NW to NNW.",

This paper proposes a feature-based machining-step sequencing strategy for NC machining centers. For the purpose of computer aided progress planning (CAPP) optimization, a mathematical model is established based on a penalty function, whereas the shortest idle time is treated as the optimization objective. By using a GA-based strategy, the sequencing problem is then resolved during machining process. It is found that this study is instructive to industrial applications.",

The results showed that after 140 random primers in 7 sets were used to amplify the rabbit genomic DNA with PCR methods, 10 have been screened out on the preliminary experiments, including BH9,AD1,BH11,AN12,AN14,O19,AD3,AD19,O4 and O14. Two primers (AD1 and BH9) among the 10 are superior to others and could not only amplify the common DNA bands of 3 rabbit strain lines but also the different characteristic bands of each strain. 78 amplified fragments were detected by electrophoresis on agarose gel. Among them, 25 fragments were polymorphic, accounting for 32.1 %. It was showed that the RAPD polymorphisms among rabbit lines were abundant. The genetic similarity between JW rabbits and NZW rabbits was highest (0.8286) among 3 rabbit strains and the lowest genetic similarity between CR and JW is 0.6190. The amplified band patterns also showed that the genetic similarity inner a strain is bigger than among different strains. The RAPD technique could be used as a method to monitor genetic relationship among different rabbit strains.",

        "abstract": "Objective EFS40\u3001EFS20\u3001mEFS40\u3001mEFS20 solution was used to cryopreserved rabbits\u2019 morula economically and effectively. Methods Three protocols were selected in this experiment. Using mEFS40 medium ( modified EFS40) (40% Ethylene glycol+ 180ppm Ficoll70(W/v)+ 0.3mol/L Sucrose in PB1) as a cryoprotective solution , rabbit morula were equilibrated two minutes in mEFS20 medium, then equilibrated in mEFS40 cryoprotective solution one minutes. After that they were trans- ferred into plastic insemination straws. The straws were kept on the liquid nitrogen for two minutes. Finally the straws with embryos was put into the liquid nitrogen. The solutions used in project two were replaced with EFS20 and EFS40, the other procedure was the same as the project one. Only EFS40 solution was used in project three, the embryos were washed three times with EFS40 and transferred into the plastic insemination straws, then put the straws into the liquid nitrogen directly. All cryopreserved embryos were thawed in 25\u2103 water, and incubate in PB1 solution. Results The post-thaw survival in three protocols was 17.1%, 69.6% and 36.1% respectively. Conclusions The rabbits morula can be effectively cryopreserved by using the EFS40 as the cryoprotectant and EFS20 as the equilibrated solution (progeet two).",

Laboratory animals are important experimental materials for life sciences. Several scientific trends have increased the large number of mouse models and placed an intolerable load on the financial and infrastructural resources needed to maintain these models as conventional breeding colonies in recent years.

VY(Slac) presented a special phenotype marked by yellow coat on the ventral surface of neck and trunk that was without melanin deposition but maintained a normal structure. The number of melanocytes in epidermis and melanin in hair follicle of the abdominal skin of the mutant mouse were less than that of their background strain, while there was no significant difference between the dorsal skins of the two strains. This mutant phenotype was inherited as single-gene dominant inheritance, confirmed by genetic experiment, and there was no significant difference between VY(Slac) and B(6) for other biological parameters such as weight, anatomic and histological structures of major organs and blood physiology. When the linkage relationship between the genomic DNA samples of F(2) 48 mice (VY(Slac)D(2)F(1)\u00d7D(2)) and mutant phenotype were evaluated, the mutant gene was confirmed on chromosome 2 near D2Mit229. New microsatellite and SNP markers were selected to amplify genomic DNA samples of 196 F(2) mice and the mutant gene was narrowed down to 5.3 Mb region between rs13476833 and rs27310903 on chromosome 2. The preliminary results of our phenotype analysis and gene location provides a solid basis for further identification of this mutant gene.",

        "abstract": "Genetic quality of outbred stock has an important effect for the experimental results by using those animals, but methods and standardization of genetic detection for outbred stock are absent. In the present study, 6 microsatellite markers were screened for Wistar from Beijing and Spague-Darley(SD) from Shanghai outbred rats by fluorescence-based semi-automated genotyping method. Good polymorphisms were detected on all the 6 microsatellite loci, with 36 alleles found in the 2 stocks, 5-8 alleles each locus, and the polymorphic information content(PIC) ranged from 0.5892(D11Mgh3)to 0.8019(D6Mit1),with an average of 0.6881. 25 and 26 alleles were detected in the 6 loci, and averages of unbiased expected heterozygosity were 0.6260 and 0.6249 in Wistar and SD outbred rats, respectively. No significant differences of genetic diversity index were tested between populations. The Fst per locus was varied from 0.0461 to 0.4363, and the average Fst of all loci was 0.2069, which implied large genetic differentiation between populations. Nei\u2032s (1972) genetic distance and Nei\u2032s (1978) unbiased genetic distance measures between the 2 stocks were 1.2862 and 1.2726, respectively, which indicated the distant genetic relationship and low genetic identity between them. All loci in Wistar and 4 of 6 loci in SD outbred rats showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium(HWE), and all deviations were caused by deficiency of heterozygous individuals. From the results, there is abundant genetic variation in Wistar and SD outbred rats. Large genetic differentiation existed between these two outbred stocks, and each possessed distinct genetic characteristic. Deviation from HWE seems a frequent problem in the 2 outbred stocks. This genetic research on outbred rats should assist in developing genetic monitoring methods and standardization of the outbred rats.",

Cryodamage of seminiferous cords was H&E stained and semi-quantitatively determined,establishing a scoring of alterations. The function of testicular tissues after xenografting was evaluated by Real Time quantitive PCR and assisted reproduction. Results The morphology of the fresh and frozen-thawed samples was significant difference( P < 0. 05). After eight-week xenografting,mature sperms were achieved from all tissues and both methods resulted in pregnancies. The number of progenies from DMSO,PROH and EFS were 5,2 and 8 respectively,after micromanipulation and embryos implanting. Moreover,the tissue-specific genes were expressed normally.

        "abstract": "Objective Providing valuable information and references for standardization of Kunming mice by detecting and analyzing genetic profiles, genetic variation and genetic differentiation of Kunming mice populations. Methods 15 microsatellite markers were screened by a fluorescence-based semi-automated genotyping method for the 3 populations of Kunming mice, BJ(population of Kunming mice maintained at the Rodent Laboratory Animal Resources in Beijing),SH(population of Kunming mice maintained at the Rodent Laboratory Animal Resources, Shanghai branch) and F1(Hybrid population between SH and population from the First Biochemical-pharmaceutical Factory of Shanghai), and genetic variation of each population and genetic diversities between populations were evaluated. Results A total of 92 alleles were detected in the 3 populations, with 2\uff5e13 and mean 6.13 at each locus, and the mean unbiased expected heterozygosity was 0.5721, which implies that there is abundant genetic variation in the populations of Kunming mice. 61, 63 and 51 alleles were detected, and mean unbiased expected heterozygosity were 0.4923, 0.5177 and 0.4550 in population BJ, SH and F1, respectively. It suggested that slightly more polymorphisms were detected in population SH than in population BJ and less polymorphism were detected in population F1. The most, 43 shared alleles, were detected between population SH and F1, which suggested low genetic differentiation between them. 37 alleles were detected between population BJ and SH, and 32 alleles were detected between population BJ and F1, which suggested high genetic differentiation. Poor genetic differentiation was discovered between SH and F1 with the mean Fst being 0.0222 and Nei's unbiased measures of genetic distance estimates being 0.0279; moderate genetic differentiation was discovered between BJ and SH with the mean Fst being 0.1433 and Nei's unbiased measures of genetic distance estimates being 0.3881; large genetic differentiation was discovered between BJ and F1 with the mean Fst being 0.1667 and Nei's unbiased measures of genetic distance estimates being 0.4162. Population SH was clustered with population F1 firstly, which were clustered with population BJ then by UPGMA method. Conclusion Genetic profiles of 3 Kunming mice were identified by 15 microsatellite loci, and moderate or large genetic differences between populations from different keepers were validated, and loss of alleles should be avoided during hybridization between populations for standardization of Kunming mice. The present study could provide valuable information and references for establish standard population of Kunming mice and genetic monitoring for it.",

Methods Thirty patients with rheumatic heart disease were randomly assigned to three groups(10 cases for each group): group A(control group),Group B(aprotinin group) and Group C(lidocaine group).The surgery was done under general balanced anesthesia and CPB was routinely set up.Six milliliter of radial artery blood was drawn on each of the five time point: T1(before CPB),T2(30 mins after aortic clamping),T3(termination of CPB),T4(2 hours after CPB),T5(24 hours after CPB).Blood samples were centrifuged promptly and the supernatant was stored at-72 \u2103.The serum levels of TNF-\u03b1,IL-6 and IL-8 were determined by ELISA within three months. Results The serum levels of TNF-\u03b1,IL-6,and IL-8 were increased from the beginning of CPB,reached peak levels two hours after CPB,and dropped to normal 24 hours after CPB.The concentrations of TNF-\u03b1,IL-6 and IL-8 at T3 and T4 were significantly different from the other time points(F=81.91183.99,q=3.18-30.39,P<0.05).The cytokine levels on T3 and T4 in groups B and C were significantly different from those of group A(F=13.60-149.10,q=5.31-23.67,P<0.05).There was no significant difference between groups B and C(P>0.05). Conclusion CPB induces the release of cytokines,thereafter causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome.Lidocaine can decrease the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in plasma and therefore attenuate the systemic inflammatory response caused by CPB.",

Methods The records of 45 aortic operations done in our hospital,from 07-2005 to 08-2009,were analyzed retrospectively,of which,the aortic aneurysmal sac-right atrial shunt procedure was applied in 18 cases.The operation time,blockage time of the aorta,postoperative drainage volume,postoperative blood transfusion and re-thoracotomy rate were summarized. Results Compared with those underwent surgery not using the shunt technique,the shunt technique showed the advantages of shorter operation time,less drainage volume,and less postoperative blood transfusion,the differences between the two groups being significant,except the time of aorta blocking and re-thoracotomy(t=1.96-3.74,P<0.05). Conclusion The aortic aneurysmal sac-right atrial shunt can effectively reduce blood loss after surgery,shorten the operation time,and decrease blood transfusion;the incidence of re-thoracotomy is low.The shunt procedure is simple to perform and worth clinical generalization.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the effects of three cryoprotectants on the structure of allogenetic aortic valves preserved in liquid nitrogen (LN) and search for the optimal one.MethodsThe allograft preserved in 0.1 mol/L DMSO served as control group; in 0.1 mol /L trehalose as experiment group 1, and in 0.1 mol/L DMSO plus 0.1 mol /L trehalose as experiment group 2. The morphology of the fresh tissue and that had been preserved by LN 6, 9 and 12 months was observed light-microscopically and electron-microscopically. ResultsThe structures of the tissues in the three groups were increasingly destroyed with prolongation of preservation duration. Light-microscopically, the morphology of the tissues in the three groups after six months of preservation was changed as compared with that of fresh tissues (d=17-30,P<0.01). The differences among the three groups were significant (d=6-13;P<0.01,0.05). Electron-microscopically, the changes of the ultramicrostructure of the aortic tissue in the control group were dramatically after 6, 9 and 12 months of preservation, the changes in group 1 was milder, and that in group 2, the mildest. ConclusionTrehalose is a good cryoprotectant for the allogenetic aortic valve preserved in the LN. The cryoprotective effect of trehalose combined with DMSO is better than that of trehalose and DMSO alone.",

OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of apoptosis and metabolization of trehalose as cryoprotectant for preserving aortic valve homograft in liquid nitrogen on their tissues and cells, and to seek the best protective agents and their optimal concentrations. METHODS: The aortas and pulmonary arteries obtained from New Zealand white rabbits and frozen in liquid nitrogen to 12, 15, 18 months, 0.1 mol/L dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.1 mol/L trehalose, 0.1mol/L trehalose +0.1 mol/L DMSO, 0.2 mol/L trehalose+0.1 mol/L DMSO, 0.3 mol/L trehalose+ 0.1 mol/L DMSO was used in liquid nitrogen, respectively. After specimens rewarming, the apoptosis of the specimens was detected by immunohistochemistry method, and the metabolism of tissue cells was detected by glucose consumption. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemistry and glucose consumption determination results showed that the freezing effects of 0.1mol/L trehalose + 0.1 mol/L DMSO and 0.2 mol/L trehalose+0.1 mol/L DMSO were the best. 0.3 mol/L trehalose+ 0.1 mol/L DMSO, which was worse than 0.1 mol/L trehalose + 0.1 mol/L DMSO and 0.2 mol/L trehalose+0.1 mol/L DMSO, ranked above 0.1 mol/L trehalose. The worst was 0.1 mol/L DMSO. The trehalose as the cryoprotectant for preserving aortic valve homograft in liquid nitrogen had a good protective effect. The separate use of trehalose was better than the separate use of DMSO. The joint use of trehalose and DMSO was better than the separate use of either one. The best concentrations of trehalose of the joint use were between 0.1 mol/L and 0.2 mol/L.",

        "abstract": "\u3010Objective\u3011 In order to improve physiology and genetics of wheat and its water use efficiency (WUE), physiological traits of wheat leaves were investigated.\u3010Method\u3011 According to Griffing\u2019s method \u2161 (1956), complete 4\u00d74 diallel crossing experiments were established through selecting 4 deferent wheat varieties belonging to both ecotypes of dry land and marsh land, giving birth to 6 orthogonal filial generations. At the grain filling stage, such physiological indexes of parents and their hybridized generations as the photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), stomatal conductance (Gs), leaf temperature (Tl) were measured using the portable photosynthesis system(LI-COR, 6400). The effects of these 5 traits on leaf WUE were observed through the analyses of phenotypic and genetic correlations. \u3010Result\u3011Throughout wheat\u2019s early, middle and late grain filling stages, leaf WUE was notably or extremely positively correlated with Pn, while it was negatively correlated with Tr and Ci. Such correlations amounted to extremely notable levels. Leaf WUE was negatively correlated with Tl and such correlations amounted to extremely notable levels at the late grain filling stage. Meanwhile, there existed conic trends between leaf WUE and Gs.\u3010Conclusion\u3011This research demonstrates the relevant dynamic effects of every trait on leaf WUE during grain filling stage, and it proves that good correlations among relevant psychological traits and leaf WUE exist, thus providing a certain basis, for the clarification of wheat leaf WUE\u2019s genetic rules.",

        "abstract": "Deficit irrigation in winter wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) has been practiced in the areas with limited irrigation water resources.The objectives of this study were to(i) investigate the effect of different deficit irrigations on yield and water use efficiency(WUE);and(ii) understand the physiological mechanisms of drought resistance,water saving and high yield under deficit irrigation in wheat.A field experiment was conducted using four wheat(Jinmai 47 and Xifeng 20 in dryland,Shijiazhuang 8 and 4185 in dry-wet land) with the treatments of rainfed(T0),watering once at jointing(T1) and watering twice at jointing and anthesis(T2).The amount of irrigation is 60 mm each time.The physiological parameters measured included net photosynthetic rate(Pn),stomatal conductance(Gs),leaf area index,dry matter accumulation and partitioning,root distribution,yield components and water consumption,as well as the corelation between WUE and yield components.Non-irrigation before jointing and deficit irrigation from jointing to anthesis could significantly improve dry matter production and deep root development,and significantly save irrigation water.Both grain yield and WUE were conically related with water consumption.Non-irrigation significantly decreased dry matter accumulation and number of spikes.Low available soil water from booting to late grain filling resulted in the lowest biomass,grain yield,harvest index and WUE in T0 treatment.The increased yield in T1 and T2 was mainly contributed by the increased number of spikes,and seeds per spike.The increased WUE was mainly contributed by increased HI.Water stress during grain filling reduced Pn and Gs,and accelerated photosynthetic leaf senescence.However,the water stress during grain filling induced remobilization of pre-anthesis carbon reserves to grains,significantly contributing the increased grain yield and HI.It is concluded that deficit irrigation between jointing and anthesis can change the root spread and develop deep root system,and significantly increase soil water use efficiency.Increasing both photosynthesis and photosynthetic duration,as well as increasing the remobilization of pre-anthesis carbon reserves and HI must increase wheat yield and WUE.",

        "abstract": "Global warming had provided both opportunities and challenges for further grain increase in Northeast China. Climate warming in particularly Northeast China had resulted in the extension of frost-free period, which had increased the productive potential and extended planting area of crops in the region. With climate warming and rapid development in modern agriculture, Northeast China had become a region with the most potential for additional increase in grain production. However, high frequencies of extreme climate (e.g., cold, flood, especially drought) associated with global warming have also threatened further grain increases in Northwest China. To efficiently resolve the problems of grain allocation, transportation, processing and transformation, and to enhance farmers\u2019 income, a number of grain security development strategies in Northeast China were advanced in this paper. The strategies included stable increases in gross grain output, well developed grain export mechanism, accelerated grain allocation, transportation, processing and transformation. As an important criterion, Northeast China should be transformed not only from a grain production to grain processing and transformation base, but also from a region driven by grain production to a region driven by agro-economy.",

        "abstract": "\u3010Objective\u3011The objective of this research was to analyze the evolutionary regularity of wheat agronomic traits and study the adaptation of winter wheat to climate change and the artificial high yield breeding.\u3010Method\u3011The agronomic traits of diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid wheat and modern wheat varieties were recorded in different growth periods and the yield traits were measured after harvesting. \u3010Result\u3011 The results showed that the tillering number and leaf number tended to reduce in wheat evolution. In the evolution of diploid \u2192 tetraploid \u2192 hexaploid, the plant height tended to increase; from the wild hexaploid wheat to modern wheat varieties, the plant height and biological yield per plant tended to decrease. In the returning green-heading period,the evolution of total leaf area per plant was diploid<tetraploid<hexaploid<landraces<modern wheat varieties, on the contrary, in the flowering-grain filling stage, the evolution of total leaf area per plant was hexaploid>tetraploid>landraces and modern wheat varieties>diploid. The biological yield per plant tended to decrease while the grain yield and harvest index tended to increase.\u3010Conclusion\u3011These results indicated that the wheat wild species kept the genetic character and growth pattern of adapting to low temperature and grew slowly. Under the natural climate warming selection and high yield plant type breeding selection, modern wheat varieties tended to mature earlier with fewer tillering number to avoid cold damage and more dry matter transported to the grains from leaves.",

        "abstract": "Water shortage is a main limited factor to agriculture and crop production,so it is important to improve the crop water use efficiency (WUE) in limited water resource. The leaf WUE is the physiological foundation for improving field water use efficiency. In early researches only one or a few wheat cultivars were employed to analyze the relationship between WUE and single or a few physiological traits,or only the daily variation regularity of leaf WUE and relevant physiological traits studied. 19 wheat cultivars,possessing different drought-resistance,from different winter wheat growth regions in China,were employed in this drought-resistance trial,with no irrigation during whole growth period,for analyzing the correlation between leaf WUE and other 11 traits of wheat flag leaf,including photosynthetic rate (P_n),transpiration rate (T_r),stomata conductance (Cond),intercellular CO_2 concentration (C_i),water potential (\u03a8_w),water loss rate of cutting leaves (RWL),anti-oxidative enzyme activities. The results showed that there were significant linear correlations between leaf WUE and six physiological traits including P_n,T_r,Cond,C_i,\u03a8_w and RWL,so that the six traits were considered to be the direct influence factors to instantaneous leaf WUE to which more attention should be paid in wheat breeding. There were insignificant correlations between leaf WUE and other four traits including anti-oxidative enzyme activities wax content T (leaf surface temp) and RWC (relative water content) were considered to be indirect influence factor for short-term leaf WUE. Otherwise,there were significant positive correlations between leaf T_r and Cond,\u03a8_w and RWL,RWL and T_r Cond,RWC and \u03a8_w,POD activity and SOD activity;and there were significant negative correlations between T_ leaf and Cond,T_ leaf and RWL. It is suggested that more attention should be paid to the research on the relationship of WUE and water channel protein,the functional genome of wheat drought-resistance and WUE,which must be helpful to improving drought resistance and water use efficiency in wheat.",

METHODS: MTT assay was applied to determine the maximum non-cytotoxic dose of \u03b1-GA, \u03b2-GA and verapamil to ensure the activity of the cells during the test and to consult the maximum test concentration of each drug; appropriate Caco-2 monolayers were established in Transwell\u2122 plates. ELISA Reader was applied to detect the concentration of Rho-123 in transfer fluid. The bi-directional transport of Rho-123 after being treated by instantaneous action and incubation with \u03b1-GA and \u03b2-GA for 72 h was studied. RESULTS: High concentration (10 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L -1) of \u03b1-GA induced the efflux of Rho-123 both in the instantaneous action test and the incubation test. High concentration (10 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L -1) of \u03b2-GA induced the efflux of Rho-123 only in the incubation test. The transport from AP to BL was not affected by any test drugs. CONCLUSION: The results of the transport experiments of P-gp substrates in Caco-2 monolayers indicated that \u03b1-GA and \u03b2-GA can induce the efflux function of P-gp and accelerate the excretion of P-gp substrates. It may be one of the mechanisms of that glycyrrhizin preparation enhances liver detoxification. Copyright 2012 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.",

        "abstract": "Aim: To investigate the possible effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an active ingredient of a commonly used Chinese herb, on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A (CsA) by intragastric administration in rats. Methods: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups by randomized block design according to weight. On the first day, after each fasting rat was intragastrically administered CsA (10 mg \u00b7 kg-1), blood samples (0.2 - 0.25 mL) were collected from the tail vein at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. From day 4 to day 8, each group began to undergo different pretreatments with intragastric administration of water, verapamil (Ver), low and high dose TMP, separately. On day 9, each group intragastrically co-administered CsA (10 mg \u00b7 kg-1) and different pretreatment compounds mentioned above, then blood samples were collected according to the schedule of the first day. The whole blood concentration of CsA was determined by HPLC. Main pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and compared by statistic analysis. Results: In the group of water pretreated and co-administrated with CsA, no significantly different pharmacokinetic parameters of CsA were found. After Ver pretreatment and co-administration with CsA, AUC0-48 h and Cmax were increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05); T1/2 \u03b2 and CL were markedly prolonged and decreased (P < 0.05); Tmax and V were not apparently influenced. After low dose TMP pretreatment and co-administration with CsA, there was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters of CsA, in spite of the increasing trends of AUC0-48 h and Cmax. After high dose TMP pretreatment and co-administration with CsA, AUC0-48 h and C max of CsA were increased significantly (P < 0.01), but there was no significant change in other parameters. Conclusion: It was indicated that the high dose of TMP could apparently increase the intragastric absorption extent of CsA, while almost had no effect on its elimination process.",

P-gp is recognized to be important in drug disposition and response since it express in certain tissues and the broad substrate specificity. Recently, a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MDR1 have been identified. However, the reported effects of MDR1 SNPs on P-gp expression and transport activity have been inconsistent and, in some case, conflicting. In this review SNPs in MDR1 in relation to population frequencies, P-gp tissue expression, drug disposition, treatment outcome and disease risk are discussed.",

Plasma samples clean-up consisted of solid phase extraction with a strata\u2122-X column. The compounds were separated on a HILIC column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 15mM ammonium acetate buffer containing 0.15% formic acid (80:20, v/v). The detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer via electrospray positive ionization (ESI(+)). The ion transitions recorded in multiple reaction monitoring mode were m/z 754.6\u2192123.8 for VDS and 779.4\u2192323.3 for IS, respectively. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range of 0.3-28ng/ml and the lower limit of quantification for VDS was 0.3ng/ml. The coefficient of variation of the assay precision was less than 13%, and the accuracy exceeded 96%. The developed assay method was successfully applied for the evaluation of population pharmacokinetics of VDS after intravenous infusion of Xi Ai Ke Vial(\u00ae) (3mg of Vindesine Sulfate for Injection) to Chinese Han subjects with hematological malignant disorders.",

        "abstract": "The abrupt change in current or voltage caused by the rapid switching action of power semiconductor devices will generate high-frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) and needs to be located as the primary interference sources in power electronics. This paper deals with interference suppression on the basis of the study of shaped switching transients in switching waveforms and closed-loop gate drive method for power MOSFETs. The characteristics of switching waveforms with arbitrary switching transients are investigated in both time- and frequency-domain. In addition, conditions of constructing a switching waveform with optimized switching transients are put forward. An optimized Gaussian switching waveform with infinite successive derivatives is proposed which provides the deepest decreasing rate in the interference source spectrum for a given switching time. Compared with a trapezoidal waveform with single-slope transients, the proposed switching waveform has better interference suppression at high frequencies. Meanwhile, a closed-loop gate control prototype with on-state resistance compensation is presented to shape the switching transients of power MOSFETs. The simulated and experimental results show that the proposed controller is successfully implemented to shape the drain\u2013source voltage into an optimized Gaussian reference. Spectrum comparisons show that the EMI generation is effectively suppressed as expected.",

The premise of the study is that a line impedance stabilization network (LISN) is used as the conducted interference testing circuit to isolate the EMI noise from the power source. Permutation, phase and amplitude adjustment matrices are obtained by calculating the variance, covariance and correlation of the separated signals and the observed signals. The proposed method is able to identify and recover the common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) noises perfectly from the total noise measured by the LISN. The simulation with synthetic signals and the experiment using a power converter as an equipment under test (EUT) demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of eliminating indeterminacy in the ICA for conducted EMI separation.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved new SiC MOSFET gate drive method to reduce overshoots in current and voltage, EMI (electromagnetic interference), and switching oscillations. Compared with Si MOSFET, SiC MOSFETs can work under higher switching speed and higher supply voltage, which results in stronger oscillations, EMI and more losses. Therefore, reducing the switching oscillation and studying the switching loss is an important research direction in the field of power electronics. The theoretical derivation of the causes of oscillations was given and lists the oscillation equations in this paper. In addition, it is proposed to control the switching oscillation and the switching loss by increasing the gate resistance during the Miller platform. Considering that the oscillation of the gate voltage has an important influence on the switching of the gate resistance, the oscillation equation of the gate voltage is studied carefully. On the other hand, the feedback part of the gate voltage is added to suppress the gate oscillation and the output oscillation to some extent. Finally, the circuit element parameters were optimized to get better simulation results with Pspice compared with the traditional hard switching.",

However, the inherent shortcoming of SRM, principally the torque ripple, limited its development. In this paper, the direct torque control (DTC) method for four-phase SRM will be researched. The relationship between space flux vector and voltage vector will be analyzed, and the switch on-off state principle will be established. The DTC control strategy is simulated by using Simulink, compared with the widely used traditional strategy -current chopper control (CCC). The simulation shows that DTC for four-phase (8/6) SRM can reduce the torque ripple with 73% compared to the traditional strategy.",

        "abstract": "The rapid switching action of power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) causes high-level electromagnetic interference (EMI) in power converters. The switching transient waveform modification method realized by closed-loop gate drive has been recognized as an effective high-frequency EMI reduction approach. However, feedback control of power MOSFET in the saturation region would introduce stability problems. This paper presents a sufficient condition-based stability analysis of all the operating points during turn-off using Kharitonov\u2019s theorem. Firstly, a small-signal MOSFET model during turn-off was used to derive the closed-loop system transfer function. The nonlinear capacitances and the rest constant parameters of the small-signal model were determined based on the device characteristics and the expected outcome of the drain-source voltage. Then we split the turn-off switching transient into several subintervals, during which the system characteristic equation became an interval polynomial due to the nonlinear capacitances. Finally, Kharitonov\u2019s theorem was applied in each subinterval to evaluate the stability, thereby achieving the overall system stability analysis during turn-off. Experiments were conducted to investigate the system\u2019s stability and the results confirmed the validity of the proposed analysis. This work presents an implementable design guideline for the applied switching transient waveform modification of power converters via closed-loop gate drive.",

Dielectric properties were measured in the temperature range from 20 to 350 K. High dielectric constants and single dielectric transition peaks were found in both TMO films. The dielectric constants of TMO film on STO substrate were larger than those of TMO film on LAO substrate; correspondingly, the transition temperature of TMO film on STO substrate was higher than that of TMO film on LAO substrate. Although x-ray diffraction showed both TMO films had the same epitaxial orientation, atom force microscopy revealed that the films had different surface morphologies, which originated from the YBCO layers on different substrates. The good surface morphology of YBCO layer and the element diffusion between TMO and YBCO layers may be suggested to be responsible for the significant improvement in the dielectric properties of TMO thin film. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics.",

The instrument uses self-collimating optics structure, and one quadrant Si-photoelectric cell is used as the detector. With specially disposed rotor surface, the transducer generates two orthogonal square waves. After quadrupling and directions judging, these signals are sent to a single chip microcomputer. Finally the instrument outputs the speed and direction of the rotor. Because the subtraction processes is adopted, the system can eliminate the noise and outside disturbance signals effectively; and pass-zero processing method can avoid the effect of optics facular intensity changes.

        "abstract": "Chlorophyll fluorescence is closely related to photosystem II (PS II), and chlorophyll fluorescence analysis has become one of the most powerful and widely used techniques that are available to plant physiologists and ecophysiologists. In this article we report the genetic study of leaf chlorophyll fluorescence traits in wheat. 114 wheat recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from W-7984\u00d7Opata85 were used as samples and QTLs of chlorophyll relative content (C), minimum fluorescence yield of PS II (Fo), maximum fluorescence yield of PS II (Fm), variable chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Fv), maximum quantum yield of PS II (Fv /Fm), and time of achieving maximum fluorescence yield (Fm) were obtained and analyzed. Five QTLs associated with C are detected on 4B, 4D, 6D and 7A, and the relative additive contribution of locus C6D and C7A is 15.60% and 11.04%, respectively; two pairs of interaction loci affecting C are found. Three QTLs are identified for Fo on 1A, 1B and 1D. One QTL for Fv is mapped on 7D, and it is found that five pairs of interaction QTLs influencing Fv. One loci significantly influencing Fm is on chromosome 5A, which acts as a major effect gene and can explain 20.69% of total phenotypic variation for Fm, and closely links with the RFLP marker Xcdo749. There are six QTLs controlling Fm mapped on 2D, 3D, 4A, 4D, 5D and 7D; one pair of interaction QTLs influencing Fm exists. Three pairs of interaction QTLs influence Fv/Fm, showing a general epistatic contribution of 94.62%. The identified QTL markers for chlorophyll fluorescence traits will be useful for understanding the genetics background and marker-assisted selection in wheat photosynthetic traits improving.",

        "abstract": "Colored-grain wheat is one kind of new germplasm resource in cereal crops, some of which are rich in beneficial anthocyanins. The genetics of wheat with blue and white grains or those with purple and white grains have been investigated. However, as far as we know, the genetics of wheat with purple and blue grains has not been reported. We bred new lines of colored-grain wheat by crossing einkorn wheat (Triticum boeoticum, AA) and French rye (French Secale cereale, RR) as male parents (mixed pollination) with a high-quality bread wheat line Y1642 (derived from common wheat and Agropyron elongatum, AABBDD) as the female parent. We selected colored-grain wheat lines in the F6 generation that exhibited different colored grains in the same spike to study the genetic patterns of colored-grain wheat. In addition to normal grain color segregation ratios, we found some unconventional segregation ratios such as 1:37 (blue to white). Furthermore, we found blue and purple grains in the same spike of blue-grain or purple-grain wheat lines. For blue wheat grain the color is due to the blue aleurone layer. The coloration of a purple wheat grain is located in the pericarp and testa. This unique phenomena may be due to the influences of environmental factors as well as genetic factors. Besides, the colored-grain wheat lines used in this work may be genetically unstable. Some unique segregation ratios are also observed in the genetic segregation of grain color. The results will be useful for genetics and breeding in colored-grain wheat.",

        "abstract": "\nWater deficit is an important yield-decreasing factor in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Normally, it has been hypothesized that plants under water deficit suffer from carbon (C) shortage and their growth is thus limited. In this study, the changes in plant growth and carbohydrate metabolism during wheat adaptation to water deficit were investigated. The results showed that water deficit induced a decrease in stomatal conductance and transpiration as early avoidance responses to water deficit. Mild deficit stimulated lateral root development, thus facilitating water uptake. While leaf relative expansion rate was decreased more than photosynthesis, water deficit leads to a more positive C balance. Carbohydrate metabolites measured (starch and sugars) showed a diurnal turnover that often increased under mild water deficit suggesting that these metabolites were readily available for being metabolized in source organ or exported to roots. The relative growth rate in mild deficit plants was higher than that in well-watered treatment, although leaf growth was decreased. Water deficit induced a shift of metabolism enzymes activities that was indicative of increased, rather than decreased, C availability. These results showed that wheat seedlings exhibited fast acclimation to changes in environmental conditions which results in an increased availability of C for the roots, and increased turnover of C metabolites. Mild water deficit increased water use efficiency through increasing dry matter production and saving water use.",

The Arabidopsis ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, Cer5, was found to be an exporter of wax molecules. Full-length wheat tacer5 cDNA, a sequence homologous to cer5, was isolated. Similar to other transporters of the ABCG subfamily, TaCer5 also has a typical basic structure of NBD-MSD\n (nucleotidebinding folds domain \u2014 membrane-spanning domain). Although the identity scores of TaCer5 and other ABCG transporters\n are not very high, amino acid residues of NBDs and MSDs are highly conserved among them. Tacer5 is a tissue-specific gene. The transcripts of tacer5 were found in leaf tissues and predominantly in stem tissues but were hardly detectable in root tissues. Stress inhibited\n the expression of tacer5. The expression was significantly decreased by salinity, low temperature, and 48-hour-darkness and also by exogenous phytohormone\n abscisic acid and salicylic acid, although not significantly. Exposure to polyethylene glycol either increased the expression\n or decreased it, depending on the duration of exposure. All the above factors also decreased the extent of wax deposited on\n wheat leaves. It is therefore concluded that transport of wax molecules is affected by environmental factors.",

        "abstract": "Drought is a major environmental stress that severely restricts plant growth and crop productivity. A previous study showed that TaWRKY2 from wheat (Triticum aestivum) plays an important role in drought stress tolerance. In the present study, we isolated the promoter of TaWRKY2 and identified multiple regulatory cis-elements in the promoter region. The activity of the TaWRKY2 promoter was induced by drought, salt, heat and ABA. We also generated TaWRKY2-overexpressing transgenic wheat,and found that the transgenic seedlings exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to drought stress, as evidenced by a higher survival rate and lower water loss rate of detached leaves compared to wild-type(WT) plants. In addition, the transgenic lines had higher contents of free proline, soluble sugar and chlorophyll.During a prolonged period of drought stress before the heading stage, the growth of WT plants was inhibited, whereas the TaWRKY2-overexpressing lines progressed to the heading stage. The increased grain yield of the transgenic wheat lines reflected the cumulative effects of longer panicle length, more kernels per spike, and greater aboveground biomass. Our findings show that TaWRKY2 can enhance drought tolerance and increase grain yield in wheat, thus providing a promising candidate target for improving the drought tolerance of wheat cultivars through genetic engineering.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   No-tillage of summer maize after the harvest of winter wheat is the main agricultural practice on the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) Plain of China. However, long-term no-tillage in the absence of deep tillage practices affects soil properties, and this effect is not beneficial for the growth and yield production of summer maize. Field experiments were conducted in 2016 in two agricultural sub-zones (Luancheng and Guoyang) in the HHH Plain. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of deep vertical rotary tillage (DVRT), compared to no-tillage with strip subsoiling (NTSS), on dry matter accumulation (DMA) and yield formation. DVRT significantly reduced the soil bulk density of the top soil layer (0\u201340\u00a0cm), especially for the lime concretion black soil in the Guoyang experimental site. Compared with NTSS, the soil water content in the 20\u201360\u00a0cm soil layer was increased under the condition of DVRT. DVRT also significantly increased root DMA in the 0\u201330\u00a0cm soil layer in Luancheng and in the 0\u201340\u00a0cm soil layer in Guoyang. The total shoot DMA, seed DMA, and harvest index of DVRT were significantly higher than those of NTSS, primarily due to a significant increase in post-anthesis DMA. In addition, DVRT increased the maximum and mean grain filling rate and thus significantly increased the maximum grain weight at harvest. Compared with NTSS, DVRT significantly increased grain yield by 21.3% and 27.8% under the plant density of 6.75\u00a0pl\u00a0m \u22122  and 9\u00a0pl\u00a0m \u22122 , respectively, in Luancheng and it increased by 12.3% in Guoyang. The present results indicate that DVRT can be used as a deep tillage practice to improve soil properties and grain yield of summer maize, and this may provide guidance regarding the requirements to cope with a diversity of deep tillage machines and develop sustainable agriculture in the HHH Plain of China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Scientific production management in the field is the main measure to increase crop yield. Different production practices and soil fertility has profound effects on the yield of wheat ( Triticum aestivum  L.) in northern China. A meta analysis of 6470 observations from 175 research papers for studies done across 77 locations in northern China was undertaken with respect to grain yield (GY) of winter wheat as influenced by soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorous (AP), and available potassium (AK) under common production practices. The results were as follows: (1) Mulching and tillage increased GY by 13.2 and 7.8% relative to that from conventional tillage, respectively. (2) GY, spike number (SN), and grain number per ear (GNE) were markedly affected by mineral nitrogen (N) application rate at 200\u2013285\u202fkg\u202fha \u22121 . (3) Application of N affected GY nearly three times more than mulching combined with tillage did, and the effect of N being evident mainly in SN and GNE. (4) SOM at 10\u201314.9\u202fg\u202fkg \u22121 , TN at 1\u20131.5\u202fg\u202fkg \u22121 , AP at 10\u201319.8\u202fmg\u202fkg \u22121 , and AK at 100\u2013200\u202fmg\u202fkg \u22121  were the most effective soil fertility levels to improve wheat GY among all the research levels.",

Methods: Four hundred and eight tumors were examined by gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonography, and the vessel numbers, gray-scale characteristics were recorded for further retrospective analysis. Results: There were significant differences of color Doppler flow vessel numbers in tumors with different sizes. The signs of posterior acoustic shadowing, the interior necrotic or cystoid areas could be seen more in malignant tumors without vessels visualized than those with vessels. Using the vessel numbers as the only criteria for benign or malignant tumors had relatively lower sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values. Conclusion: The size of the tumors and the signs of the posterior acoustic shadowing, the necrotic or cystoid areas in the tumors significantly affect the visualization of blood flow in breast tumors by color Doppler ultrasonography, so the vessel numbers can not be a useful criterion for differentiating malignant breast tumors from the benigns.",

Methods We analyzed the flow numbers, the flow morphologic characteristics and the spectral Doppler parameters of one hundred and ninety-two small malignant and benign breast masses (\u22642 cm) on the color flow imagings retrospectively, and compared them with the larger mass group (>2 cm) respectively. Results The vascular detecting rate of the small breast masses in malignant and benign groups were 83.0% and 58.1% respectively, which had more significant difference than that of the larger group. Although the diagnostic sensitivity was low with flow numbers as criteria for malignancy, the specificity was much higer than that used in the larger masses. The more the vessels, the higher the specificity. The penetrating vessel had a high diagnostic specificity for malignant breast masses while the circular vessel was a characteristic of benign masses, but both of them had lower sensitivity, as same as the larger group. In the small breast masses, RI\u22650.72 utilized as a criterion for malignancy had a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 84%, which were higher than those of the larger masses. Conclusion The vessels visualized by color Doppler ultrasonography in small breast masses, especially the more signals, was more likely suggestive of malignancy than that in larger breast masses.

Each institutional ethic review board approved the study, and all the patients gave written informed consent. All the patients underwent the UE procedure and the strain ratios were calculated and the final diagnosis was made by histological findings.  sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were calculated for each of the two evaluation systems and the areas under the ROC curve were compared.Results The strain ratios of benign lesions (mean, 2.6\u00b12.0) and malignant lesions (mean,7.9\u00b15.8) were significantly different (p  0.05).  strain ratio method shows better a diagnosis performance of the lesions with elasticity score 3 and 4.Conclusions Although the two UE methods have similar diagnostic performance, separate calculation of the strain ratios seems compulsory, especially for the large solid breast lesions and the lesions with elasticity score 3 and 4.",

        "abstract": "The new application of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in the diagnosis of breast masses has evolved quickly only in recent years. Nevertheless, mixed results owing to the overlap in characteristics of benign and malignant lesions are simultaneously discovered by most studies, partially attributed to different histopathologic characteristics of breast cancer.To explore the characteristics of different histopathologic types of breast cancer at real-time gray-scale CEUS and evaluate its diagnostic value.One hundred and one histopathologically confirmed malignant lesions were included. We retrospectively reviewed the contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic findings including morphologic features, quantitative parameters, and correlated them with histopathology. True-positive rate was calculated to assess the diagnostic performance of CEUS.The 101 malignancies displayed irregular shape (72 [71%]), poorly-defined margin (73 [72%]), penetrating or tortuous surrounding vessels (79 [78%]), heterogeneous enhancement (84 [83%]), including focal perfusion defects (24 [24%]). For each histopathologic type, 87% (58/67) of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) showed heterogeneous enhancement. Of all the 24 perfusion defects, IDC account for 88% (21/24). Low average peak intensity (PI) of 4.9 was detected in this type. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) excellently showed the features of irregular shape (82% [14/17]), poorly-defined margin (82% [14/17]), heterogeneous enhancement (94% [16/17]). While 83% (5/6) of medullary carcinoma exhibited regular shape, well-defined margin, homogenous enhancement, and high average PI value of 9.6. Invasive lobular carcinoma showed similar enhancement pattern to that of IDC. Intraductal papillary carcinoma displayed high average PI value of 8.1. The overall true-positive rate for conventional US and CEUS was 88%, 86%, respectively. DCIS, medullary carcinoma, and intraductal papillary carcinoma achieved an improved true-positive rate (94%, 100% and 100%, respectively).The imaging characteristics of CEUS are variable in different histopathologic types of breast cancer. CEUS does not appear to be superior to conventional ultrasound as a diagnostic tool overall, however, it is a useful adjunct to conventional ultrasound in diagnosing some special types of breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "The present study focuses on the function of cpg15, a neurotrophic factor, in ischemic neuronal recovery using transient global cerebral ischemic (TGI) mouse model and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated primary cultured cells. The results showed that expression of cpg15 proteins in astrocytes, predominantly the soluble form, was significantly increased in mouse hippocampus after TGI and in the cultured astrocytes after OGD. Addition of the medium from the cpg15-overexpressed astrocytic culture into the OGD-treated hippocampal neuronal cultures reduces the neuronal injury, whereas the recovery of neurite outgrowths of OGD-injured neurons was prevented when cpg15 in the OGD-treated astrocytes was knocked down, or the OGD-treated-astrocytic medium was immunoadsorbed by cpg15 antibody. Furthermore, lentivirus-delivered knockdown of cpg15 expression in mouse hippocampal astrocytes diminishes the dendritic branches and exacerbates injury of neurons in CA1 region after TGI. In addition, treatment with inhibitors of MEK1/2, PI3K, and TrkA decreases, whereas overexpression of p-CREB, but not dp-CREB, increases the expression of cpg15 in U118 or primary cultured astrocytes. Also, it is observed that the Flag-tagged soluble cpg15 from the astrocytes transfected with Flag-tagged cpg15-expressing plasmids adheres to the surface of neuronal bodies and the neurites. In conclusion, our results suggest that the soluble cpg15 from astrocytes induced by ischemia could ameliorate the recovery of the ischemic-injured hippocampal neurons via adhering to the surface of neurons. The upregulated expression of cpg15 in astrocytes may be activated via MAPK and PI3K signal pathways, and regulation of CREB phosphorylation.   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT  Neuronal plasticity plays a crucial role in the amelioration of neurological recovery of ischemic injured brain, which remains a challenge for clinic treatment of cerebral ischemia. cpg15 as a synaptic plasticity-related factor may participate in promoting the recovery process; however, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. The objective of this study is to reveal the function and mechanism of neuronal-specific cpg15 expressed in astrocytes after ischemia induction, in promoting the recovery of injured neurons. Our findings provided new mechanistic insight into the neurological recovery, which might help develop novel therapeutic options for cerebral ischemia via astrocytic-targeting interference of gene expression.",

A 1/8 scaled train model, about one-dimensional in longitudinal direction, was used to carry out a scaled train collision test. Corresponding multibody dynamic simulations were conducted using traditional and improved method model (IMM) in ADAMS. In IMM, the connection between two adjacent cars was expressed by a nonlinear spring and energy absorbing structures were equivalently represented by separate forces, instead of one force. IMM was able to simulate the motion of each car and displayed the deformation of structures at both ends of the cars. IMM showed larger deformations and energy absorption of structures in moving cars than those in stationary cars. Moreover, the asymmetry in deformation proportion in main energy absorbing structures decreased with increasing collision speed. The asymmetry decreased from 11.69% to 3.60% when the collision speed increased from 10\u2009km/h to 36\u2009km/h.",

In addition, based on the developed RS models, multi-objective optimization design (MOD) was carried out by using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). It was found that the uniformity of energy distribution of two stages and the SEA cannot reach the optimal value at the same time.

To improve the energy absorption performance of the energy-absorbing structure under an eccentric collision, in this paper, a FE model of the energy absorption structure for subway vehicles was created and validated by experimental data. Based on the validated FE model, the collision performances under a vertical offset of 0\u201380\u00a0mm and a horizontal offset of 0\u201340\u00a0mm are studied via simulation. The results show that the original structure is prone to instability when the horizontal offset is greater than 30\u00a0mm, so it is necessary to perform an optimization. Based on the bending strength, the cross-sectional shape of the guide was changed. The results show that there is no instability phenomenon in the improved structure I1 under all horizontal offsets. Under the horizontal offset of 40\u00a0mm, compared with the original structure, the energy absorption increased by 175.89%, and the peak force also increased by 14.46%. Based on the concept of gradient material, the honeycomb strength in the structure is changed into a gradient distribution, and the results show that the improved structure I2 also did not show any instability phenomenon under all horizontal offsets.

An experiment was set up to study the energy absorption characteristics of the coupling device. Based on the structure of the device, a finite element (FE) model was established and validated by experimental results. The valid FE model was used to predict the responses of the expanding structure. A full factorial design and a central composite design of experiments (DOE) were used to take samples for the variables (friction coefficient ( \u03bc ), thickness of deformable tube ( T ) and slope angle of conical mandrel \uff08 \u03b1 \uff09). Based on these samples, an approximation model was built with the moving least squares method (MLSM). Main effects analysis was performed with the full factorial design results and it was found that  T  had the most significant effect on the average force ( F   avg  ), while  \u03b1  most influenced the specific energy absorption ( SEA ). Considering  F   avg  , fracture and buckling of the structure as constraints, parameters optimization was carried out using the adaptive response surface method (ARSM) to gain a higher  SEA . Finally, the optimum parameters ( u  = 0.25,  T  = 5.5\u00a0mm,  \u03b1  = 34.5\u00b0) with the  SEA  value of 34.8\u00a0kJ/kg was obtained.

Non-linear explicit code LS_DYNA3D(971) was utilized in building detailed finite element models, which were also validated by previous test data. Considering the expensive selling price, complicated fabricating technology and low production rate of high strength honeycomb, honeycombs with appropriate strength should be selected to fill in the steel structure. Therefore, scientific sampling points were chosen from the design space using Box-Behnken design method. Analysis of variance was performed in order to explore the effects of distributed honeycomb strength in four levels on crashworthiness indicators. Response surface methodology (RSM) was well applied to perform both parametric analysis and multiobjective optimization for searching the optimal configurations. Here, two different criterion were conducted in optimization process by adopting desirability approach. It was find that the composite structure with high strength honeycombs in level-1 and level-2 and relatively low strength honeycombs in level-3 and level-4 are preferable for use. Comparing with the empty steel structure, the optimal EA capacity is promoted by 35.32% in criterion 1 and 34.35% in criterion 2, being able to bear the condition with crashing speed of 36\u202fkm/h and impacting mass of 55.3\u202ft.

First, circular tubes composed of different materials, namely, mild steel and aluminium alloy, are used in this study, and the material parameters are obtained from tensile tests. A finite element simulation model of an energy-absorbing circular tube is established and validated through experiments. Second, the Hammersley sampling method was used to design an experiment for the energy-absorbing circular tube under three deformation modes (i.e., concertina mode, mixed mode and diamond mode). Dimensional analysis of the deformation displacement, energy absorption and mean crushing force of the energy-absorbing circular tube under the three deformation modes was carried out. Relationships between the deformation displacement, energy absorption and mean crushing force of the energy-absorbing circular tube and the parameters of the impact mass, impact velocity, etc. are obtained by fitting the results of the dimensional analysis. The fitting accuracy is greater than 0.95. Next, the energy-absorbing circular tube impact experiments were performed, and the experimental results were compared with the fitting results. The error between the predictions and the experimental results is within 10%, so the prediction results are accurate. Finally, the equivalent substitution method between the aluminium alloy and mild steel energy-absorbing circular tube is discussed. The results show that the equivalence of energy absorption is the best equivalent substitution method for the lightweight design of an energy-absorbing circular tube and the length and diameter of the energy-absorbing circular tube should be held constant to obtain the equivalent thickness.",

First, the crashing characteristics of the gradual cut-out grooved energy-absorbing structure (GCGES) are studied and the finite element model (FEM) is validated by dynamic impact tests. Then, response surface (RS) models are established regarding the validated FEM. Based on RS models, the energy absorption (EA) and initial peak crushing force (IPCF) are formulated as functions of cut-out groove dimensions. In further, parametric studies are performed to evaluate the effects of design variables on collision responses. It is found that both EA and IPCF are negatively affected by the cut-out grooves. Particularly, the effect of design parameters on IPCF is obviously greater than that on EA capacity. To minimize the IPCF under the constraint of EA, optimization technology with adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) algorithm is adopted. The optimal results indicate that the IPCF decreases by 31.02% comparing with the initial designed GCGES and 63.60% comparing with the common flat surface energy-absorbing structure (FSES). From the vehicle safety view, the cut-out grooves are introduced successfully and the optimized GCGES is of considerable significance and advantages in crashworthiness application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This paper proposes a new circumferentially corrugated square tube (CCST) with a cosine profile. The cross section of the CCST is controlled by a cosine expression with parameters that include the number ( N ) of cosine wave crests, the amplitude ( A ) and the nominal side length (2 L   0  ). Finite element (FE) models validated by experimental results were constructed in Ls_dyna to analyse the crashworthiness performance of the CCSTs. The numerical results show that the collapse modes of CCSTs are classified into five types, i.e., non-ordered progressive mode (NPM), ordered progressive mode (OPM), inversion mode (IM), global buckling mode (GBM) and extensional mode (EM). After analysing the collapse characteristics, force-displacement characteristics and crashworthiness indexes, we found that the OPM has better crashworthiness performance than the other modes. Moreover, a more comprehensive parametric study was conducted to understand the effects of the geometric parameters  N ,  A  and wall thickness ( t ) on the crashworthiness performance of CCSTs. The results show that the collapse modes of CCSTs are fairly sensitive to the cross-sectional configuration and wall thickness. Increases in  N ,  A  and  t  all cause increases in the initial peak crushing force ( IPCF ), and the wall thickness  t  has the most significant effect on  IPCF . However, the effects of the three geometric parameters on specific energy absorption ( SEA ) are much more complicated and are largely dependent on whether the collapse modes change or not with increases in the three parameters. The numerical results also show that the  SEA  of CCSTs is improved by 51.62% compared with that of a square tube (ST) when they have the same mass (55.3\u202fg) and by 69.24% when they have the same wall thickness ( t \u202f=\u202f1.25\u202fmm). These results reveal that CCSTs with OPM have good energy absorption ability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study proposes a new axisymmetric rectangular tube (ART) with diaphragms. Unlike a uniform thickness tube (UTT), the thicknesses of adjacent ART walls are defined to be independent, with the thicknesses of the opposite walls remaining identical. The finite element model of ART with diaphragms was developed and validated by experiments; moreover, we found this structure exhibited acceptable values of crashworthiness indexes with a controllable and stable collapse pattern. To explore coupling influences of the three types of thicknesses on crashworthiness indexes and obtain optimal designs, we conducted a design of experiment (DOE) and employed polynomial response surface method (PRSM) for parameter study and optimisation. It was found that the ART with diaphragms achieved superior crash performance compared with the UTT with diaphragms, because of lower peak force and higher specific energy-absorption. When configurations of the ART wall thickness changed, the sensitivity of the two tube-wall thicknesses on crashworthiness indexes also changed and diaphragm thickness had different influences on crashworthiness indexes. Moreover, the distribution of design parameters of the thicknesses of ART was helpful in developing a crashworthiness design strategy. Therefore, we introduced this ART with diaphragms into crashworthy subways and recommended optimal designs as excellent energy-absorbing structures in practical engineering.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study proposes a  cutting-style  energy absorbing structure to improve the crashing performance of subway vehicles through experiment and numerical simulations. The structure consists of an anti-creeper device, energy absorption tube, cutting knife and clamp. A finite element ( FE ) model of a  cutting-style  energy absorbing structure is created and validated by full-scale experimental data. Based on the validated simulation model, the influence of the design parameters, which include the cutting depth ( d ), the cutting edge angle ( CEA ) and the chip central angle ( CCA ), on the impact performance is analyzed. The parametric study found that the design parameters influence the peak cutting force (     F    p     ) and energy absorption ( EA ). In addition, the structure has prominent advantage in lowering the peak interface force. Finally, the response surface method ( RSM ) is adopted to achieve maximum  EA  and minimum      F    p      simultaneously. The optimized results show that the objectives compete with each other, and the weighting factors are of considerable significance to the most satisfactory Pareto fronts solutions. In this paper, the minimum distance selection method ( TMDSM ) is adopted to determine the most satisfactory solution.

        "abstract": "Mechanical property of materials is an important foundation to determine the strain strengthening parameters. The chemical composition, plant thickness, strain rate and other factors' influence on strength, plastic and other mechanical properties of the austenitic stainless steel were studied. The research shows that the chemical composition should be designed for the strain strengthening austenitic stainless steel according to its effect on the austenite stabilization, and the content of the austenite stabilized composition should be ensured. Due to the difference between the hot and the cold rolling process, the deformation of the plates varies with thickness. Therefore the volume increment of the inner container of the cryogenic vessels is of large difference under the same strengthening stress. The design and manufacture of the strain strengthening austenitic stainless steel cryogenic vessels should take full account of the differences in thickness of the sheets. The lower the tensile strain rate, the greater the deformation under strengthening stress. The influence of strain rate on the mechanical properties of the austenitic stainless steel weakens gradually with the increase of deformation.",

The model included an inner high density polyethylene (HDPE) layer, an inner steel wires layer, an outer steel wires layer and an outer HDPE layer. Based on the linear viscoelastic constitutive equations of the four layers, the critical buckling pressure of the PSP at different buckling time was deduced according to the shallow shell theory. To carry out the parallel experiments, the external pressure experimental device and a vacuum experimental equipment were designed. Good agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental data was observed. It shows that the presented model can be used to predict the critical creep buckling pressure of the PSP. The design parameters were investigated and the measures to increase the critical buckling pressure of the PSP were proposed.",

More than 20 shrink-fit high pressure vessels with such junction have been safely used in the People's Republic of China. Experiments and engineering practices show that this junction is easy in fabrication and weight can be at least reduced by 20% compared with conventional joints. The larger the vessel, the greater the benefits. In this paper the authors conducted strength investigation on such a vessel with inner diameter 1000mm, design pressure 31.4MPa, and established a stress analysis model with FEA considering both the change in wall thickness of the formed hemispherical head and the effect of the height of physical gap between head and ring. The calculated stresses are in good agreement with the measured ones.",

In this study, the model for the leakage of high pressure H2 due to storage tanks failure was established and corresponding numerical simulation method was put forward. By the numerical simulation proposed, the different characteristics of the dispersion H2 which leaks from different leakage positions of the storage tank were obtained. The simulation results show that the endangerment caused by the H2 leakage occurred in the bottom or side position of the H2 storage tank is much more serious than that caused by the leakage occurred in the top of the vessel. Furthermore, the approximate equations for the transport distance calculation of the hazard regions caused by H2 storage tanks failure were obtained. The numerical simulation results can provide reference for dealing with the leakage of high pressure hydrogen storage tanks such as the leakage occurred in hydrogen filling stations.",

The flow and the heat transfer behaviors in the fluidized bed with immersed tube were simulated by the programs based on the new method when the k-\u03b5 turbulence model and the multi-way coupling heat transfer model among particles,tube wall and gas were employed. The micro-scale mechanism of heat transfer in the fluidized bed was explored by the simulation results and the critical factors that influence the heat transfer between the tube and the bed were discussed. The profiles of average solids fraction and heat transfer coefficient around the tube were obtained and the influence of gas velocity on the transfer coefficient was revealed by simulation. The computational results agree well with the experimental data,which shows that the CFD-DEM-FEM method is feasible and accurate for the simulation of complex gas-solid flow with heat transfer. And this will improve the further simulation study of the gas-solid two phase flow with chemical reactions in the fluidized bed.",

Herein, a systematic study of the Raman enhancement mechanism on distorted 1T (1T') rhenium disulfide (ReS ) nanosheets is demonstrated. Combined Raman and photoluminescence studies with the introduction of an Al O dielectric layer unambiguously reveal that Raman enhancement on ReS materials is from a charge transfer process rather than from an energy transfer process, and Raman enhancement is inversely proportional while the photoluminescence quenching effect is proportional to the layer number (thickness) of ReS nanosheets. On monolayer ReS film, a strong resonance-enhanced Raman scattering effect dependent on the laser excitation energy is detected, and a detection limit as low as 10 m can be reached from the studied dye molecules such as rhodamine 6G and methylene blue. Such a high enhancement factor achieved through enhanced charge interaction between target molecule and substrate suggests that with careful consideration of the layer-number-dependent feature and excitation-energy-related resonance effect, ReS is a promising Raman enhancement platform for sensing applications.",

Herein, a novel molten salt decomposition method to prepare 3D metal nitrate hydroxide (MNH, M = Ni, Co, and Cu) nanoarrays homogenously grown on different conductive substrates, especially on nickel foam (NF) for OER applications, is reported. Compared with the as-prepared CoNH/NF and CuNH/NF, NiNH/NF presents a superior electrocatalytic OER activity and stability in an alkaline solution, with a very low overpotential of only 231 mV versus a reversible hydrogen electrode to deliver a geometrical catalytic current density of 50 mA cm and a low Tafel slope of 81 mV dec , outperforming most reported transition metal compound catalysts. Structural investigation after the OER process reveals the morphology integrity of the nanoarrays but the formation of metal oxyhydroxide (for NiNH and CoNH) or oxide (for CuNH) as the likely real active species. These metal nitrate hydroxide non-noble metal electrocatalysts can be prepared by an economical and simple method, with enhanced intrinsic activity and long-term stability and durability, which might be new candidates for energy conversion and storage applications.",

Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of amorphous hollow M(OH)x (M = Fe, Co, Ni) nanocubes through a template-assisted route inspired by Pearsonu0027s hard and soft acid\u2013base (HSAB) principle with Cu2O nanocubes with different sizes (50 nm, 500 nm) as the sacrificial templates. A comparative study of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the hollow M(OH)x nanocubes with a similar size indicates that Ni(OH)2 has better OER catalytic activity. It has been revealed that the metal oxyhydroxides formed at the surface are actually the real active species for the OER electrocatalysis. In particular, Ni(OH)2 nanocubes obtained by the Cu2O (50 nm) template provide the best OER activity, with a low overpotential of 349 mV vs. RHE to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 and a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec\u22121.

This work demonstrates, for the first time, that VO2 nanosheet materials can be another SERS-active platform for molecule detection based on the chemical enhancement mechanism. A systematic study of the phase transition induced Raman enhancement on VO2 nanosheets reveals that increase in the crystal symmetry from VO2(B) to VO2(M) and to VO2(R) results in a dramatic decline in the enhancement ability of the probe molecules. On defect-rich VO2(B) nanosheets, a detection limit as low as 10\u22127 M can be reached for various dye molecules, confirming VO2 nanosheets as another kind of effective SERS-active semiconductor metal oxide. This study strongly indicates that a synergetic strategy of low-dimension and low-symmetry may be a new avenue for the design of highly efficient metal oxide-based semiconductor SERS substrates.",

        "abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenides have shown promise as highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of ternary 2H-MoS2xSe2(1\u2212x) nanosheets for enhanced hydrogen production. Compared to pristine 2H-MoSe2 and 2H-MoS2, introduction of a third element not only expands the interlayer spacing, but also provides more active catalytic sites and lowers the charge transfer resistance. As a consequence, MoS2xSe2(1\u2212x) exhibits a high electrocatalytic HER activity with a low overpotential of 188 mV vs. a RHE to achieve a geometric current density of \u221210 mA cm\u22122 and a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec\u22121 in 0.5 M H2SO4. This study provides valuable insights that ternary structure formation can be effective for the preparation of high-performance HER electrocatalysts.",

        "abstract": "In order to further enhance the performance of photocatalysts, cocatalysts are used to accelerate the photocatalytic reactions. Herein, ultrafine cobalt oxide (CoO) nanoparticles are synthesized through a novel bottom-up strategy and explored as an efficient non-noble cocatalyst to dramatically promote the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of CdS nanorods. CdS/CoO heterostructures, consisting of highly dispersed 3-5 nm CoO nanoparticles anchored on the CdS nanorods, can provide a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 6.45 mmol g-1 h-1 (\u223c36 times higher than that of bare CdS nanorods) in the visible-light region (>420 nm). Combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy analyses suggest Co-S bond formation between CoO and CdS, which guarantees efficient migration and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. This work provides a new avenue for adopting CoO as an effective cocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production in the visible-light region.",

By considering the oxophilicity of the doping element, here we demonstrate the Mn (with higher oxophilicity) and Ni (with lower oxophilicity) doping of Ni 1- x  Mn  x  PS 3  and Mn 1- x  Ni  x  PS 3  NSs on their HER and OER activity in alkaline solution. It is found that non-substituted NiPS 3  NSs show better catalytic activity than their Mn-doped samples. On the contrary, Ni doping into MnPS 3  NSs significantly improves the electrocatalytic performance. This work may substantially expand the understanding of the role of elemental oxophilicity on the electrochemical water splitting activities of Ni/Mn based catalysts.",

The as-prepared Au\u2013PANI nanocomposites show high catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by NaBH4, which are also promising platforms for monitoring the plasmon-driven catalytic conversion of 4-aminothiophenol (4ATP) into 4,4\u2032-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB).

In this work, CdS/Cu7S4/g-C3N4 ternary heterostructures are fabricated by ion exchange between CdS and Cu+, and subsequent ultrasonication-assisted self-assembly of CdS/Cu7S4 and g-C3N4, which provide excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution without any noble metal co-catalyst. With the presence of p-n junction, tuned bandgap alignments and higher charge carrier density in the CdS/Cu7S4/g-C3N4 ternary heterostructures that can effectively promote the spatial separation and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, a high hydrogen evolution rate of 3570 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 4.4% at 420 nm and remarkable recycling stability are achieved. We believe the as-synthesized CdS/Cu7S4/g-C3N4 ternary heterostructures can be promising noble-metal-free catalysts for enhanced hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting.",

        "abstract": "The morphology-dependent property of crystal materials has aroused extensive attentions and raised high requirements for subtly tailoring the morphology of micro-/nanocrystals. Herein, we develop an in-situ etching method for preparation of Prussian blue (PB) microcrystals with morphology evolution by progressively increasing the concentration of chloroplatinic acid in the reaction system. These PB microcrystals with controllable morphologies are employed as photo-Fenton reagents to degrade organic pollutants. PB hexapods (PB-hpds) and PB hexapod stars (PB-hpss) present superior catalytic performance to pristine PB microcubes (PB-cubs) and other PB intermediates with truncated corners or edges due to their high specific surface areas and adequate exposure of FeIII-NC coordination active sites. In the reusability test, the reused PB-hpds present more efficient catalytic performance for Rhodamine B (RhB) decomposition compared with the pristine catalyst. According to more investigations, the reasonable mechanism is proposed that FeIII-NC exhibits higher catalytic activity than FeII-CN in the specific coordination environment. The increased content of surface FeIII-NC coordination active sites is the key factor in accelerating the decomposition of H2O2 and enhancing the photo-Fenton performance of PB-hpds. Several operating parameters including catalyst dosage, H2O2 concentration, pH value, and reaction temperature are evaluated in detail. Classical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements further reveal that HO\u00b7 should be responsible for high performance of catalysts. This work will be significant for tailoring the morphology of the materials and arousing more attention to enhance the stability and reusability of catalysts.",

        "abstract": "One-dimensional microstructure has been regarded as one of the most desirable configurations for magnetic carbon-based microwave absorbing materials (MAMs). Herein, pea-like Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs) are successfully prepared through a direct pyrolysis of the mixture of FeCl3\u00b76H2O and melamine under inert atmosphere. The chemical composition and microstructural feature of these Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs composites are highly dependent on the pyrolysis temperature. As a result, their electromagnetic properties can be also manipulated, where dielectric loss gradually decreases with increasing the pyrolysis temperature and magnetic loss presents a reverse variation trend. When the pyrolysis temperature reaches 600 \u00baC, the as-obtained composite, Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs-600 can perform a maximum reflection loss of -46.0 dB at 3.6 GHz with a thickness of 4.97 mm and a qualified bandwidth of 14.8 GHz with the integrated thickness from 1.00 to 5.00 mm. It is very interesting that the microwave absorption performance of this new kind of composites is not so susceptible to the pyrolysis temperature as those common magnetic carbon-based MAMs, because there is an effective balance between dielectric loss and magnetic loss, which accounts for a very stable attenuation ability when the pyrolysis temperature range changes from 600 to 700 \u00baC. These favorable characteristics, including low-cost raw materials, easy preparation, and stable performance, may render Fe/Fe3C@NCNTs composites as a novel kind of MAMs in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    In situ  pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is becoming a popular technique to construct uniform carbon-based composites with excellent performance in many research fields. In this study, Co/C composites derived from a zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-67, are selected as novel microwave absorbers. The obtained Co/C composites with uniform polyhedron microstructure are actually composed of amorphous carbon frameworks and highly dispersed core-shell Co@graphite nanoparticles. The pyrolysis conditions are carefully optimized, and the effects of pyrolysis temperature on carbon content, graphitization degree, magnetic property, and porous structure are also investigated. It is very interesting that these Co/C composites present different dielectric loss ability and similar magnetic loss ability, resulting in their distinguishable reflection loss characteristics. Among these candidates, the Co/C composite pyrolyzed at 800\u00a0\u00b0C (Co/C-800) shows the best microwave absorption due to its dual loss mechanisms and well matched characteristic impedance. The control experiments indicate that both high-purity Co phase and ordered microstructure are indeed helpful to improving their performances. Moreover, the effective microwave absorption frequency can be further manipulated by the polyhedron size of Co/C composites, which may provide an exciting clue for the design and fabrication of lightweight and highly effective microwave absorbers in the future.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalysis for Friedel-Crafts type benzylation has received much attention in recent years due to its characteristic of environmental benefits. In this paper, titanate nanotubes (TNTs) were employed as heterogeneous catalyst support, and a new kind of Fe3+-exchanged titanate nanotubes (Fe-TNTs) catalyst with highly dispersed ferric sites was constructed by an ion exchange technique. The obtained catalyst was systematically characterized by XRD, TEM, N2 adsorption, XPS, and UV-vis spectra. As expected, Fe-TNTs showed excellent catalytic activities in the benzylation of benzene and benzene derivatives. The recycling tests for Fe-TNTs were also carried out, where the reason for the gradually decreased activity was carefully investigated. Superior to some reported catalysts, the catalytic ability of used Fe-TNTs could be easily recovered by ion exchange again, indicating that Fe-TNTs herein were a highly active and durable heterogeneous catalyst for Friedel-Crafts type benzylation. These results might be helpful for the design and preparation of novel heterogeneous catalysts by combining the structural advantages of titanate nanotubes and active metal ions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rational design on the microstructure of electromagnetic composites offers immense potential for overcoming the challenges related to the microwave absorption performance. In this study, uniform core-shell Co@C microspheres are innovatively fabricated through an  in situ  transformation from Co 3 O 4 @phenolic resin precursor. Carbon shells restrain the agglomeration of Co particles during high-temperature treatment, which accounts for the survival of uniform core-shell microstructure. Electromagnetic analysis reveals that Co@C microspheres show quite different electromagnetic functions as compared with pure Co derived from Co 3 O 4  microspheres. On one hand, carbon shells can effectively regulate the complex permittivity of Co@C microspheres by reducing conductivity loss and introducing polarization relaxations; on the other hand, carbon shells suppress the skin effect from cross-linked Co networks and make the isolated Co cores produce stronger magnetic loss. The microwave absorption properties are evaluated in the frequency range of 2.0\u201318.0\u00a0GHz, and as expected, core-shell Co@C microspheres exhibits excellent reflection loss characteristics, where strong reflection loss (\u221268.7\u00a0dB\u00a0at 10.6\u00a0GHz), ultra-wide response bandwidth (2.7\u201318.0\u00a0GHz over\u00a0\u221210\u00a0dB), and thin matched thickness (1.65\u00a0mm) can be achieved. A delta-function method and attenuation constant validate that the matched characteristic impedance and improved loss ability in Co@C microspheres account for the significant enhancement.",

Conjugated polymer (CP)-based composites appear as a promising kind of MAM with the desirable features of low density and high performance. In this review, we introduce the theory of microwave absorption and summarize recent advances in the fabrication of CP-based MAMs, including rational design of the microstructure of pure conjugated polymers and tunable chemical integration with magnetic ferrites, magnetic metals, transition metal oxides, and carbon materials. The key point of enhancing microwave absorption in CP-based MAMs is to regulate their EM properties, improve matching of characteristic impedance, and create diversified loss mechanisms. The examples presented in this review will provide new insights into the design and preparation of CP-based composites that can satisfy the high demands of the oncoming generation of MAMs.",

However, it is always difficult to construct desirable microstructures in magnetic metals due to their strong magnetic interactions. Herein, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of three-dimensional flower-like Ni microspheres (FNMs) through a simple two-step process, in which flower-like Ni(OH)2 microspheres are firstly prepared by a hydrothermal route and then are reduced under a high-temperature H2/N2 atmosphere. The as-prepared FNMs are composed of cross-linked nanoparticles directed by their precursor. Compared with commercial and home-made Ni powder, FNMs exhibit enhanced conductivity and dielectric loss ability, as well as significantly improved impedance matching. As a result, FNMs exhibit good microwave absorption properties, including a strong reflection loss (\u221256.8 dB at 15.8 GHz) and a broad qualified frequency range (2.5\u201318.0 GHz) with thicknesses ranging from 5.0 to 1.0 mm and a thin matching thickness of 1.12 mm. Such an excellent performance is substantially superior to those of Ni-based materials derived from various elaborate strategies.

        "abstract": "Traditional magnetic metal and alloy materials suffer from easy oxidation and high density, which hinders their practical application as high-performance microwave absorbers. Lightweight and durability have become new goals in the fabrication of the next generation of microwave absorbers. Herein, we report the synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy) nanosphere/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites through chemical reduction of self-assembly PPy nanosphere/GO hybrids. PPy nanospheres and GO are integrated effectively by \u03c0\u207b\u03c0 interaction of dual conjugated systems. When the mass ratio of PPy nanospheres to rGO is 0.6:1, the resultant composite, PPy/rGO-0.6, presents comparable/superior reflection loss characteristics to those magnetic metals and their related graphene-based composites in previous studies. Electromagnetic analysis reveals that well-matched characteristic impedance, multiple polarization loss, and good conductivity loss are, together, responsible for the excellent microwave absorption performance of PPy/rGO-0.6. More importantly, PPy/rGO-0.6 also exhibits good microwave absorption after being treated at 423 K for a long time. This work provides a new idea for designing and preparing a high-performance microwave absorber with lightweight and durable features.",

Among them, conjugated polymer (CP)-derived heteroatom-doped carbon materials exhibit remarkable electrochemical performances because the heteroatoms can be preserved at a relatively high content and keep stable under harsh working conditions. In this review, we summarized recent advances in the rational design and various applications of CP-derived heteroatom-doped carbon materials, including polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and their ramification-derived carbons, as well as transition metal-carbon nanocomposites. The key point of considering CP-derived heteroatom-doped carbon materials as important candidates of electrode materials is that CPs contain only nonmetallic elements and some key heteroatoms in their backbones which provide great chances for the synthesis of metal-free heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructures. The presented examples in this review will provide new insights in designing and optimizing heteroatom-doped carbon materials for the development of anode and cathode materials for electrochemical device applications.",

        "abstract": "Metal cobalt is one of the most promising candidates for high-performance microwave absorbers due to its compatible dielectric loss and magnetic loss abilities. Rational design on the microstructure of metal cobalt became a popular way to upgrade its microwave absorption performance in the past decade, while much less attention has been paid to the electromagnetic functions derived from its different crystal structures. Herein, we report the microwave absorption of porous cobalt assemblies with varied composition of close-packed hexagonal (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) phases. Electromagnetic analysis reveals that the change of phase composition can significantly impact the complex permittivity and complex permeability of metal cobalt, where hcp-cobalt favors high complex permittivity and fcc-cobalt produces high complex permeability. The optimum phase composition in these porous cobalt assemblies will promise well-matched characteristic impedance and good performance in strong reflection loss (\u221241.0 dB at 9.4 GHz) and wide response bandwidth (4.0\u201317.4 GHz over \u221210.0 dB). The enhanced microwave absorption is superior to many cobalt absorbers ever reported. It is believed that these results will provide a new pathway to the design and preparation of highly effective metal cobalt and cobalt-based composites as novel microwave absorbers in the future.",

Herein, a mixed titanium oxides strategy, utilizing TiO2/Ti2O3 heterostructures consisting of in situ grown TiO2 nanotubes with mixed anatase and rutile phases on bulk Ti2O3 materials, is demonstrated for efficient and recyclable hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic water splitting. Taking advantange of the formed heterostructures and the created porous structures, the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of anatase TiO2 can be first delivered to rutile TiO2 and then transferred to Ti2O3. Meanwhile, the presence of Ti2O3 in TiO2/Ti2O3 heterostructures can substantially promote the charge mobility and suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Hence, with tuned bandgap structure that enables rapid electron-hole separation, increased charge carrier density and enhanced light absorption, the TiO2/Ti2O3 heterostructures provide an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate as high as 1440 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1 under full-sunlight irradiation and without any other cocatalyst. This mixed titanium oxides strategy may open up new avenues for designing and constructing highly efficient TiO2-based photocatalytic materials for various applications.",

The thickness of PANI shells, from 30 to 120 nm, can be well controlled by modulating the weight ratio of aniline and PPy microspheres. PPy microspheres with abundant carbonyl groups have very strong affinity to the conjugated chains of PANI, which is responsible for the spontaneous formation of uniform core\u2013shell microstructures. However, the strong affinity between PPy microspheres and PANI shells does not promote the diffusion or reassembly of two kinds of conjugated chains. Coating PPy microspheres with PANI shells increases the complex permittivity and creates the mechanism of interfacial polarization, where the latter plays an important role in increasing the dielectric loss of PPy@PANI composites.

Natural ferromagnetic resonance and dielectric loss mainly contribute to the electromagnetic wave absorption of the CoxNi1\u2212x alloy materials, and the composition also has great influence. Co1Ni2 (x = 0.33) has the strongest absorption of \u221210.5 dB at 13.6 GHz at a thickness of 2 mm, and the electromagnetic absorption properties can be tuned by the thickness of the CoxNi1\u2212x alloys.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Rational manipulation on chemical composition and microstructure is evolving as a powerful approach to reinforce the electromagnetic (EM) functions of magnetic carbon-based composites. With FeCo Prussian blue analogs (FeCo PBAs) as the nucleation sites, we conduct the polymerization of dopamine (DA) on their surface and then convert the precursor into desirable FeCo alloy/carbon composites. PDA coating is greatly helpful to suppress the microstructure collapse of FeCo PBAs during high-temperature pyrolysis, resulting in a unique hierarchical configuration of core-shell FeCo@C nanoparticles encapsulated in PDA-derived carbon nanocages. The formation of carbon nanocages not only adjusts the relative carbon content, but also affects EM properties of these composites. In particular, the dielectric loss can be significantly enhanced, which further accounts for an improvement in overall attenuation ability toward incident EM waves. When the weight ratio of DA to FeCo PBAs reaches 0.75, the obtained composite will exhibit excellent microwave absorption performance thanks to its decent attenuation ability and matched characteristic impedance. The strongest reflection loss intensity is located at\u00a0\u221267.8\u202fdB\u202fat 15.8\u202fGHz, and the effective bandwidth covers 11.0\u201316.3\u202fGHz with the thickness of 2.00\u202fmm. The advantages in microstructure are also established by parallel comparison with a disordered counterpart.",

        "abstract": "The rational design of the microstructure of magnetic carbon-based composites has become a popular strategy to enhance their microwave absorption properties. Herein, with Ni-containing metal\u2013organic framework as the self-sacrificing precursor, we have successfully prepared waxberry-like Ni@C microspheres as novel microwave absorbing materials, which artfully integrated the advantages of core\u2013shell configuration and hierarchical architecture. The effects of the pyrolysis temperature on the microstruture, carbon content, relative graphitization degree, magnetic properties, and electromagnetic parameters were carefully investigated. The composite that was pyrolyzed at 700 \u00b0C (Ni@C-700) exhibited desirable microwave absorption performance, including a strong reflection loss intensity of \u221273.2 dB and a broad qualified bandwidth of 4.8 GHz with an applied thickness of 1.8 mm. The electromagnetic analysis revealed that such good performance of Ni@C-700 was benefited from both the well-matched impedance and decent attenuation ability. The superiority of this unique microstruture was also validated by comparing it with some homologous composites and isolated core\u2013shell Ni@C nanoparticles. It is believed that these results may provide a new pathway to promote the electromagnetic applications of conventional magnetic carbon-based composites by optimizing their microstructure.",

        "abstract": "Binary dielectric composites are appearing as a kind of promising candidate for conventional magnetic materials in the field of microwave absorption. Herein, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of core-shell BaTiO3@carbon microspheres through a space-confined strategy. The electromagnetic properties of BaTiO3@carbon microspheres can be easily tailored by manipulating the relative content of carbon shells. It is confirmed that dielectric loss of these composites mainly benefits from conductivity loss, dipole orientation polarization, and interfacial polarization, and the core-shell configuration shows its positive contribution to the reinforcement of interfacial polarization. When the content of carbon shells is optimized, the as-obtained composite will display excellent microwave absorption performance due to decent attenuation and well-matched impedance. The strongest reflection loss can reach up to -88.5 dB at 6.9 GHz with the absorber thickness of 3.0 mm, and the qualified bandwidth below -10.0 dB covers 9.0-12.0 GHz when the thickness is designated at 2.0 mm. Such a performance in X band is superior to those of most typical binary dielectric systems. More importantly, these BaTiO3@carbon microspheres maintain good performance after being treated under high-temperature and acidic conditions for a long time, manifesting their promising prospect for practical application. It is believed that these results may be helpful for the development of multicomponent dielectric systems as high-performance microwave absorbing materials.",

        "abstract": "Surface plasmon assisted catalysis (SPAC) reactions of 4-aminothiophenol (4ATP) to and back from 4,4'-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) have been investigated by single particle surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, using a self-designed gas flow cell to control the reductive/oxidative environment over the reactions. Conversion of 4ATP into DMAB is induced by energy transfer (plasmonic heating) from surface plasmon resonance to 4ATP, where O\u2082 (as an electron acceptor) is essential and H\u2082O (as a base) can accelerate the reaction. In contrast, hot electron (from surface plasmon decay) induction drives the reverse reaction of DMAB to 4ATP, where H\u2082O (or H\u2082) acts as the hydrogen source. More interestingly, the cyclic redox between 4ATP and DMAB by SPAC approach has been demonstrated. This SPAC methodology presents a unique platform for studying chemical reactions that are not possible under standard synthetic conditions.",

        "abstract": "MoSe is a promising earth-abundant electrocatalyst for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), even though it has received much less attention among the layered dichalcogenide (MX ) materials than MoS so far. Here, a novel hydrothermal-synthesis strategy is presented to achieve simultaneous and synergistic modulation of crystal phase and disorder in partially crystallized 1T-MoSe nanosheets to dramatically enhance their HER catalytic activity. Careful structural characterization and defect characterization using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy correlated with electrochemical measurements show that the formation of the 1T phase under a large excess of the NaBH reductant during synthesis can effectively improve the intrinsic activity and conductivity, and the disordered structure from a lower reaction temperature can provide abundant unsaturated defects as active sites. Such synergistic effects lead to superior HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 152 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the electrocatalytic current density of j = -10 mA cm , and a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec . This work paves a new pathway for improving the catalytic activity of MoSe and generally MX -based electrocatalysts via a synergistic modulation strategy.",

Herein, we report the synthesis of S, N dual-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets via a simple pyrolysis of a mixture of melamine and dibenzyl sulfide as efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The S, N dual-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets show enhanced activity toward ORR as compared with mono-doped counterparts, and excellent durability in contrast to the conventional Pt/C electrocatalyst in both alkaline and acidic media. A high content of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N is necessary for ORR electrocatalysis in the graphene-like carbon nanosheets, but an appropriate amount of S atoms further contributes to the improvement of ORR activity. Superior ORR performance from the as-prepared S, N dual-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets implies great promises in practical applications in energy devices.",

Herein, an ultrafast photodimerization of p-aminothiophenol (PATP) into p,p\u2032-dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) was witnessed on the hybrid system of Ag/TiO2 by visible-light laser excitation, even under inert gas atmosphere. Hot electrons generated from plasmonic decay would transfer to the conduction band of TiO2, which enables the holes (generated in the metal nanoparticles) to trigger the immediate PATP\u2013DMAB conversion. We believe such ultrafast reaction process, with highly enhanced efficiency, will greatly promote the research and applications of the surface-plasmon-induced or assisted catalytic reactions.",

However, the practical performance of CdTe solar cells is often severely restricted due to the deficiency or excess of Cu diffusion, leading to a non-ohmic contact and electrical shorts and thus performance degradation. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative strategy for the fabrication of a Cu-free back contact by depositing CdTe quantum dots (QDs) on a CdTe layer using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, and find that the average relative power conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced by \u223c6.2%. More importantly, the as-prepared CdTe QDs are thermally stable and CdTe with CdTe QD/Au back contact devices show no sign of degradation during exposure to air even after nearly one year. This study provides new insight into the design and property modulation of CdTe-based photovoltaics.",

        "abstract": "2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have been recognized as active platforms for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Here, the effect of crystal structure (phase) transition is shown, which leads to altered electronic structures of TMD materials, on the Raman enhancement. Using thermally evaporated copper phthalocyanine, solution soaked rhodamine 6G, and crystal violet as typical probe molecules, it is found that a phase transition from 2H- to 1T-phase can significantly increase the Raman enhancement effect on MoX2 (X = S, Se) monolayers through a predominantly chemical mechanism. First-principle density functional theory calculations indicate that the significant enhancement of the Raman signals on metallic 1T-MoX2 can be attributed to the facilitated electron transfer from the Fermi energy level of metallic 1T-MoX2 to the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the probe molecules, which is more efficient than the process from the top of valence band of semiconducting 2H-MoX2. This study not only reveals the origin of the Raman enhancement and identifies 1T-MoSe2 and 1T-MoS2 as potential Raman enhancement substrates, but also paves the way for designing new 2D SERS substrates via phase-transition engineering.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Nitrogen-abundant compounds are generally regarded as perfect precursors toward in situ synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon materials. In this study, we demonstrate a facile one-pot procedure to synthesize polyaniline-coated melamine fiber (PANI@MF) as the precursor, in which melamine fiber (MF) acts as both scaffold and nitrogen source. After high-temperature pyrolysis, wrinkled nitrogen-doped carbon nanoribbons (NCNRs) with high specific surface area (701\u00a0cm 2 \u00a0g \u22121 ) and cumulative pore volume (3.13\u00a0cm 3 \u00a0g \u22121 ) are fabricated for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The NCNR catalyst exhibits comparative onset potential, half-wave potential, and limiting current to those of commercial Pt/C (20\u00a0wt%, E-TEK) in alkaline media, mainly due to its high specific surface area and sufficient active sites induced by synthetic effect between nitrogen atom and carbon framework. Moreover, NCNR catalyst shows enhanced stability and high tolerance to methanol crossover effect. This study is expected to broaden new horizon to the design and fabrication of new metal-free carbon-based electrocatalyst for ORR.",

Here, by using novel porous (holey) metallic 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets synthesized by a liquid-ammonia-assisted lithiation route, we systematically investigated the contributions of crystal structure (phase), edges, and sulfur vacancies (S-vacancies) to the catalytic activity toward HER from five representative MoS2 nanosheet samples, including 2H and 1T phase, porous 2H and 1T phase, and sulfur-compensated porous 2H phase. Superior HER catalytic activity was achieved in the porous 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets that have even more edges and S-vacancies than conventional 1T phase MoS2.

        "abstract": "Abstract   In virtue of abundant sodium resources, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the absence of a suitable anode material makes it difficult to realize these applications. Here, we demonstrate an effective synthesis strategy of using a \u201cmicroreactor\u201d consisting of melamine fiber (inside) and graphene oxide (GO, outside) to fabricate three dimensional (3D) nitrogen doped (N-doped) graphene as high-performance anode materials for sodium ion batteries. Through a controlled pyrolysis, the inside melamine fiber and the outside GO layer has been converted into N-doped graphene and reduced graphene oxide ( r -GO) respectively, and thus the \u201cmicroreactor\u201d is transformed into interconnected 3D N-doped graphene structures. Such highly desired 3D graphene structures show reversible sodium storage capacities up to \u223c305\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121  after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.2\u202fA\u202fg \u22121  and promising long cycling stability with a stable capacity of \u223c198\u202fmA\u202fh\u202fg \u22121 \u202fat 5\u202fA\u202fg \u22121  after 5000 cycles. The high capacity and superior durability in combination with the facile synthesis procedure of the 3D graphene structure make it a promising anode material for SIBs and other energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are becoming a new type of metal-free heterogeneous catalysts in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation. In this study, porous nitrogen-doped carbon (PNC) microspheres derived from Zn\u2013Co Prussian blue analogues (Zn\u2013Co PBAs) are employed as heterogeneous catalysts in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The unique configuration of the metal centers/clusters bound by cyanide groups (\u2013CN) of Zn\u2013Co PBAs offers the PNC microspheres abundant porosity, a high graphitization degree, and rich nitrogen substitution, which lead to improvements in the catalytic performance. PNC-800 (pyrolyzed at 800 \u00b0C) exhibits better performance than other common carbon materials and homologous nitrogen-doped carbocatalysts derived from ZIF-8/ZIF-67. Based on radical quenching and trapping experiments, a non-radical pathway is proposed to dominate methylene blue (MB) degradation; and the high graphitization degree and rich surface graphitic N sites of PNC-800 are two key factors that induce the non-radical pathway. Several influential factors, including catalyst dosage, PMS concentration, pH value and reaction temperature, are investigated in detail. Notably, MB degradation over PNC-800 is almost completely insusceptible to common ions and natural organic matter, and maintains its catalytic efficiency under the background conditions of several real water samples. More interestingly, this non-radical pathway and the good catalytic performance of the PNC-800/PMS system are universal in the degradation of other typical organic pollutants. We believe that these PNC microspheres may be a promising green heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants, and this study can be used for the design of high-performance carbocatalysts in non-radical systems in the future.",

        "title": "Rational design and synthesis of SnO2-encapsulated \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanocubes as a robust and stable photo-Fenton catalyst",
        "abstract": "Abstract    In situ  transformation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is becoming a fascinating strategy to construct porous metal oxides with excellent performance in many fields. In this work, Prussian blue (PB) nanocubes are employed as the precursor of porous Fe 2 O 3  to fabricate SnO 2 -encapsulated  \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3  (Fe 2 O 3 @SnO 2 ) nanocubes by pre-coating Sn(OH)Cl on the surface of PB nanocubes. It is very interesting to find that SnO 2  shells can not only preserve the microstructure of Fe 2 O 3  nanocubes from high-temperature treatment, but also facilitate the phase variation from metastable  \u03b3 / \u03b2 -phase to stable  \u03b1 -phase. The thickness of SnO 2  shells can be controlled by manipulating the amount of stannous chloride. When Fe 2 O 3 @SnO 2  nanocubes are applied as heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalysts, they will exhibit much better catalytic efficiency for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) than PB-derived Fe 2 O 3  and commercial  \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 . The characterization results reveal that Fe 2 O 3 @SnO 2  nanocubes have similar catalytic mechanism to conventional  \u03b1 -Fe 2 O 3 , and stable microstructure and preferable crystalline phase are primarily responsible for this significant enhancement. Some influential factors, including H 2 O 2  concentration, catalyst dosage, pH value, and reaction temperature are investigated and analyzed in details. Moreover, Fe 2 O 3 @SnO 2  nanocubes can maintain their catalytic efficiency during the repeated batch experiments. We believe Fe 2 O 3 @SnO 2  nanocubes can be a new kind of high-performance green heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants, and this study may provide a new idea to upgrade the performance of some conventional catalysts by rational design in the future.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages\u2013encapsulated carbon nanobubbles (CBs@NCCs) were feasibly fabricated by the in situ thermal conversion of Co\u2013Fe Prussian blue analogues (Co\u2013Fe PBAs) coated with polydopamine (PDA) shells. Interestingly, PBA cores can act as a self-sacrificing template and decompose during high-temperature treatment. PDA shells play a crucial role in stabilizing the steric architecture, supplementing nitrogen-doping of CBs@NCCs under high-temperature treatments. When compared with carbon nanobubbles (CBs) without the protection of carbon nanocages, CBs@NCCs possess higher specific surface area and pore volume. The contributions of a unique configuration and proper nitrogen modification are significant for improving the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation performance of CBs@NCCs, which is expected to be a promising alternative to other conventional carbocatalysts and metal oxides. Moreover, the applicability of the as-synthesized carbocatalysts was systematically investigated by adjusting several operating parameters, and some ubiquitous anions and natural organic matters (NOMs) were also taken into account in methylene blue (MB) degradation. The radical evolution and PMS activation mechanism are investigated by radical quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests, which revealed that sulfate radicals (SO4\u02d9\u2212) and singlet oxygen (1O2) are simultaneously responsible for the overall MB removal in a CBs@NCCs-800/PMS system. This study may provide a broader perspective for upgrading the catalytic efficiency of various green heterogeneous carbocatalysts.",

        "abstract": "Biomass is a promising raw material for synthesizing heteroatom-doped carbon due to its cheap cost and easy availability. Herein, we fabricate nitrogen and sulfur codoped carbon (NSC) with extremely high specific surface areas (BET surface areas of 3015 m2/g) by employing human hair as the precursor. The graphitization degree, N/S doping content, and pore structures of NSC can be easily modulated by the heat treatment conditions. Besides, NSC obtained at 800 \u00b0C (NSC-800) even outperforms most traditional metal-based catalysts under the same conditions for BPA degradation. Influences of various operating parameters (NSC, Oxone, and BPA concentration) and the inorganic salts/humic acid (HA) on BPA degradation are comprehensively studied. Furthermore, quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements prove that 1O2 should be the main active species generated from PMS activation, and the contribution of \u2022OH/SO4\u2022\u2013 is very limited.

        "abstract": "Metal-free heterogeneous catalysts are receiving more and more attention for wastewater remediation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) due to their environmental benign. However, carbon-based materials as the most typical metal-free heterogeneous always suffer from poor durability. Inspired by the fact that a conjugated system may facilitate the electron transfer during PMS activation, we innovatively select polyaniline (PANI) as a new PMS activator and investigate its catalytic performance in detail. It is found that PANI can display better catalytic performance than traditional metal-based catalysts and popular N-doped carbocatalysts in methyl orange (MO) degradation. More importantly, PANI is not only universal for various pollutants degradation, but also maintains its catalytic performance in repeated degradation experiments. The stable N sites in the conjugated chains and the oxidation-resistance benzene rings as the building units are considered to be responsible for such an excellent durability. In addition, the influences of some routine factors and actual water backgrounds are comprehensively checked and analyzed. The quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance confirm that MO degradation is achieved through both radical and non-radical pathway, where SO4\u00b7- and 1O2 are primary reactive species. The reaction mechanism is also proposed with the assistance of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.",

        "abstract": "Using thick-shell or \"giant\" CdSe/CdS nanocrystal quantum dots (g-NQDs), characterized by strongly suppressed Auger recombination, we studied the influence of plasmonic interactions on multiexciton emission. Specifically, we assessed the separate effects of plasmonic absorption and plasmonic emission enhancement by a systematic analysis of the pump fluence dependence of low-temperature photoluminescence (low-T PL) derived from individual CdSe/CdS g-NQDs deposited on nanoroughened silver films. Our study reveals that (1) the multiexciton (MX) emissions in g-NQD coupled to silver films were enhanced not only through the creation of more excitons via enhancement of absorption but also through the direct modification of the competition between the radiative and nonradiative recombination processes of MXs; (2) strong enhancement in absorption is not necessary for strong multiexciton emission; and (3) the emission of MXs can become stronger with the increase of multiexciton order. We also exploited the strong enhancement of MX emission to perform second-order photon correlation and cross-correlation experiments using very low pump fluences and observed a strong photon bunching that decays with increasing pump fluence.

The rectifying behavior suggests that the large build-in electric field was formed in the Schottky junctions. This device has excellent position sensitivity as high as 67.8 mV mm<sup>-1</sup> illuminated by a 405 nm laser. The optical relaxation time of the LPE is about 30 \u03bcs.

Here, we report the ultrafast response of the LPV in amorphous MoS/Si (a-MoS/Si) junctions prepared by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. Different orientations of the built-in field and the breakover voltages are observed for a-MoS films deposited on p- and n-type Si wafers, resulting in the induction of positive and negative voltages in the a-MoS/n-Si and a-MoS/p-Si junctions upon laser illumination, respectively. The dependence of the LPV on the position of the illumination shows very high sensitivity (183 mV mm) and good linearity. The optical relaxation time of LPV with a positive voltage was about 5.8 \u03bcs in a-MoS/n-Si junction, whereas the optical relaxation time of LPV with a negative voltage was about 2.1 \u03bcs in a-MoS/p-Si junction. Our results clearly suggested that the inversion layer at the a-MoS/Si interface made a good contribution to the ultrafast response of the LPV in a-MoS/Si junctions. The large positional sensitivity and ultrafast relaxation of LPV may promise the a-MoS/Si junction's applications in fast position-sensitive detectors.",

High-quality KNO samples were prepared using a solid-state reaction and polarized under different electric fields. The variation of XRD and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) suggest an increased intensity of the ferroelectric polarization in the polarized samples. In contrast to the slow photodegradation rate of unpolarized KNO, the normalized photodegradation reaction rate constant was remarkably increased to 0.317 min\u22121 by the polarized KNO. The longer photoluminescence lifetime indicates that the enhancement of photocatalytic activity in polarized ferroelectric KNO powder is mainly attributed to the enhanced internal field. We believe this work may open up new avenues in photocatalysis using polarized ferroelectric materials.",

        "abstract": "The search for colossal permittivity (CP) materials continues to attract considerable interest motivated by not only academic research but also potential applications. Very recently, CP with low dielectric loss was reported in In + Nb co-doped rutile TiO2 polycrystalline ceramics. However, the mechanism of CP in this material system and the effect of doping ions are still unclear. Here, we investigated the dielectric properties of AlxNb0.03Ti0.97\u2212xO2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) ceramics. CP with low dielectric loss was found in AlxNb0.03Ti0.97\u2212xO2 samples (x \u2264 0.03). Once the amount of Al-doping exceeds Nb, the CP disappears. The change in dielectric response with varying Al-doping concentration and Ti3+ concentration together with the conductive activation energy in AlxNb0.03Ti0.97\u2212xO2 ceramics clearly suggest that the CP mechanism in co-doped TiO2 ceramics could be attributed to the internal barrier layer capacitor effect. We believe that our research provides comprehensive guidance for the development of CP materials.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE  The phenotypic diversity of type 1 diabetes suggests heterogeneous etiopathogenesis. We investigated the relationship of type 2 diabetes\u2013associated transcription factor 7 like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with immunologic and metabolic characteristics at type 1 diabetes diagnosis.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  We studied TrialNet participants with newly diagnosed autoimmune type 1 diabetes with available  TCF7L2  rs4506565 and rs7901695 SNP data ( n  = 810; median age 13.6 years; range 3.3\u201358.6). We modeled the influence of carrying a  TCF7L2  variant (i.e., having 1 or 2 minor alleles) on the number of islet autoantibodies and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\u2013stimulated C-peptide and glucose measures at diabetes diagnosis. All analyses were adjusted for known confounders.  RESULTS  The rs4506565 variant was a significant independent factor of expressing a single autoantibody, instead of multiple autoantibodies, at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 [95% CI 1.07, 2.57],  P  = 0.024). Interaction analysis demonstrated that this association was only significant in participants \u226512 years old ( n  = 504; OR 2.12 [1.29, 3.47],  P  = 0.003) but not younger ones ( n  = 306,  P  = 0.73). The rs4506565 variant was independently associated with higher C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) ( P  = 0.008) and lower mean glucose AUC ( P  = 0.0127). The results were similar for the rs7901695 SNP.  CONCLUSIONS  In this cohort of individuals with new-onset type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes\u2013linked  TCF7L2  variants were associated with single autoantibody (among those \u226512 years old), higher C-peptide AUC, and lower glucose AUC levels during an OGTT. Thus, carriers of the  TCF7L2  variant had a milder immunological and metabolic phenotype at type 1 diabetes diagnosis, which could be partly driven by type 2 diabetes\u2013like pathogenic mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "A longitudinal study showed that early C-peptide (C-P) responsiveness during OGTTs declined during progression to T1D, whereas later C-P responsiveness increased until the diagnosis was imminent. Here we exmaine: 1) whether the baseline C-P response pattern predicts T1D as suggested by the findings from that longitudinal study, and 2) the basis for the higher later C-peptide response during progression. Baseline 2-hour OGTTs from 670 Diabetes Prevention Trial-type 1 participants (age: 13.8\u00b19.6 years; BMI-z: 0.3\u00b11.1; 56% male) were analyzed. In univariate regression models, the early C-P response (30-0 min) was inversely predictive of T1D (X 2 =28.8, p 2 = 23.3, p 2  = 20.4; p 2 =41.1; p  In conclusion, the findings show that lower early and higher later C-P responses are both indicators of risk for progression to T1D. Moreover, the findings suggest that the increasing later C-P response reflects an attempt by the \u03b2-cell to compensate for higher glucose levels due to a deficient early C-P response. These findings are similar to the evolution of C-P responses during type 2 diabetes development. Partitioning C-peptide into early and later responses appears beneficial for T1D prediction and for studying \u03b2-cell deterioration during progression.  Disclosure   H.M. Ismail:  None.  D.J.

Participants were randomized to receive SSMT (n\u2009=\u2009106) or usual care (UCO) (n\u2009=\u2009113). The primary outcome-QOL (SF-36) and secondary outcomes depression (CES-D), and anxiety (STAI) were assessed longitudinally over four chemotherapy cycles. Acculturation (BAS) and patients' intervention adherence were assessed. About 63% of participants reported distress after the initial chemotherapy cycle. Hispanics with lower acculturation reported greater STAI-Trait scores (p\u2009=\u2009.003). No significant treatment effects on outcomes measures were observed for participants receiving SSMT. SSMT intervention techniques were reported useful and improved mental health scores were observed with patients on a psychotropic agent (p\u2009=\u2009.04). Hispanics experience an elevated level of distress, yet SSMT did not significantly improve primary outcomes. SSMT may be potentially effective when combined with a psychotropic agent.

        "abstract": "Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) can inhibit the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-1, which recently has been thought to involve the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This study was undertaken to determine whether there is any association between IL-1ra gene polymorphism and ALD in a Chinese population.The polymorphism of IL-1ra gene intron 2 (VNTR) was assessed in 165 alcoholics (43 alcohol-dependent subjects without liver diseases, 30 patients with alcoholic fatty liver, 61 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 31 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis) and 65 healthy control subjects by PCR with DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.The rate of IL-1RN*1 carriage was statistically higher in the alcoholics than in the control group (98.79% vs 93.85%, chi2=4.48, P<0.050). And the IL-1RN*1 allele frequency was more common in the alcoholics than in the control group (86.67% vs 76.92%, chi2=6.56, P<0.025). IL-1RN*1 heterozygote was significantly more frequent in the patients with alcoholic hepatitis or those with cirrhosis than in the alcohol-dependent subjects without liver diseases (32.79%, 29.03% vs 9.30%; chi2=7.84, chi2=4.84; P<0.010, P<0.050). The IL-1RN*2 allele frequency in the patients with alcoholic hepatitis and the patients with cirrhosis was also significantly higher than in those alcoholics without liver diseases (13.93%, 17.74% vs 4.65%; chi2=4.79, chi2=6.78; P<0.050, P<0.010). But the frequencies of IL-1RN*1 heterozygote and IL-1RN*2 allele appear to be not different between the patients with alcoholic fatty liver and the alcoholics without liver diseases.IL-1ra gene polymorphism is closely associated with race. IL-1RN*2 allele doesn't influence the susceptibility to ALD, but the gene carriers with ALD have additional risk for aggravation of the illness.",

Green tea polyphenols have both antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of tea polyphenol (TP) on alcohol-induced liver injury in rats.The rats were divided randomly into 3 groups: group A gastrically infused with alcohol for 12 weeks, group B fed with alcohol plus TP (250 mg/kg.d) simultaneously, and group C (control group) gastrically infused with normal saline. At the end of 12 weeks, the rats were sacrificed. The liver specimen of each rat was taken for histological examination. All data were statistically analyzed in quantum and semi-quantum. Gene expression of cytokines of each group was determined.At the end of 12 weeks, hepatic injury of different degrees developed in group A and group B compared to group C. The degree of hepatic injury was attenuated in group B, with slight steatosis, liver cellular swelling in small areas; less spot and focal necrosis, no bridging necrosis, less mega-bubble steatosis and less collagen deposition in contrast to group A. Gene expressions of IL-3, IL-4, IL-1R2, IL-6R, IL-7R2 were up-regulated in group B compared with group A, but those of IL-3Ra, IL-1R1 were down-regulated. Gene expressions of IL-13, IL-1R1, IL-7R2, EPO-R, LIFR were up-regulated in group A compared with group C, but those of IL-1R2, IL-5R2, CSF1, CD27, IL-6R were down-regulated.TP is able to attenuate alcoholic liver damage. Cytokine may contribute to alcoholic liver disease.",

FLD was diagnosed based on an ultrasonography examination. Serum AFP levels were measured with a chemiluminescence immunoassay.Of the 9800 subjects enrolled, 2601 were diagnosed with FLD. Subjects with FLD had higher serum AFP levels than those without the disease. Subjects with high serum AFP levels had a higher prevalence of FLD, metabolic syndrome, and its components. Univariate logistic analysis showed that elevated serum AFP levels were associated with an increased risk of FLD (OR = 1.057, 95%CI: 1.031-1.084). However, after adjusting for covariates, AFP no longer remained significantly associated with the risk factors for FLD.Our results suggest that serum AFP levels are significantly associated with FLD and that AFP acts as a cofactor, but not as an independent factor, for FLD.",

Methods: 104 specimens of tissues, including pancreatic cancer tissue, non-cancer tissues not more than 1.5 cm from the cancer, and normal tissues, underwent microarray examination and immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of p53, p16, and COX-2. The correlation among these 3 genes was analyzed. Results: p53, p16, and COX-2 were all significantly highly expressed in the cancerous tissues in comparison with other tissues. P53 and p16 were both significantly correlated with COX-2 (both P < 0. 05), however, there was not a correlation between p53 and p16 (P > 0.05). There was a reciprocal relationship between p53 and COX-2 (P < 0.05, OR = 19.686) influencing the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Conclusion: Tissue microarray technique is effective method to detect multiple gene protein expression. Pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer is associated with p53, p16, and COX-2.",

It is suggested that the precise clinical diagnosis should be based on the reconstruction of digitized three-dimensional model with original image data of adenomyosis. Patients' age and clinical manifestations should also be considered, and the patients should be stratified according to reproductive requirements, so as to determine the best treatment. In view of the infiltration and diffuse growth of adenomyosis lesions in the myometrium of the uterus, it is suggested that long-term drug management should be adopted after surgical or non-surgical lesion resection.Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, dienogest and short-acting oral contraceptives should be recommended to consolidate the curative effect in order to delay the progress of the disease and prevent recurrence.",

Since the rational agents forming dynamically collaboration relationships can make their macro-behaviors governed by social dependence norms, SMGSC not only can remove effectively the uncontrollability hindrance confronted with by open social activities, but also enables cross-management-domain collaborations to be implemented by uniting the centralized controls of social individuals for respective social activities.

        "abstract": "Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a type of catechin. It exhibits excellent antioxidant effects and anti-tumour activities for cancer chemoprevention. The mechanism of anti-tumour effects of EGCG on different cancers has been studied for the past few decades, but remains controversial. To investigate the potential role that EGCG may play in the epigenetic regulation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line, we integrated bioinformatics analysis with experimental validation. We found that levels of the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) were significantly higher in CRC tissues compared to normal adjacent tissues, based on the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal. Different human CRC cell lines exhibited differing expression of levels of the EZH2 protein. In RKO cells, EGCG and the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 exhibited similar inhibitory efficacy on the proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of the cells, and suppressed protein expression of trimethylated lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), which may be caused by the loss of the enzymatic function of EZH2. EGCG and GSK343 were found to have a synergistic effect on the growth of RKO cells in lower concentrations. EZH2-correlated genes were enriched in the cell cycle pathway, the top-ranking up-regulated pathway in tumour tissues, based on pathway analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). In accord with this, we confirmed that EGCG and GSK343 could both significantly arrest the G0/G1 phase in RKO cell cycle, suggesting EGCG and EZH2 inhibitor share a common mechanism of action in RKO cells.",

Meanwhile, the antihyperlipidemia effect of EFPT was investigated as well. It was found that the oral maximum tolerated dose of EFPT was more than 10.0 g per kg body weight both in rats and mice. And it had no mutagenicity as judged by negative experimental results of the mutation test. No abnormal symptoms, clinical signs or deaths have been found in rats in each group throughout the experiments. In addition, EFPT in this study showed certain effects on hyperlipidemia. ",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies propose that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an abundant polyphenol in green tea, has anti-cancer properties. However, its mechanism of action in breast cancer remains unclear. This study investigated the capacity of EGCG to suppress breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, characterizing the underlying mechanisms, focusing on the effect of EGCG on glucose metabolism. EGCG reduced breast cancer 4T1 cell growth in a concentration- (10-320 \u03bcM) and time- (12-48 h) dependent manner. EGCG induced breast cancer apoptotic cell death at 24 h, as evidenced by annexin V/PI, caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 activation. Furthermore, EGCG affected the expression of 16 apoptosis-related genes, and promoted mitochondrial depolarization. EGCG induced autophagy concentration-dependently in 4T1 cells by modulating the levels of the autophagy-related proteins Beclin1, ATG5 and LC3B. Moreover, EGCG affected glucose, lactate and ATP levels. Mechanistically, EGCG significantly inhibited the activities and mRNA levels of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and to a lesser extent the activity of pyruvate kinase (PK). In addition, EGCG decreased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), critical players in regulating glycolysis. In vivo, EGCG reduced breast tumor weight in a dose-dependent manner, reduced glucose and lactic acid levels and reduced the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In conclusion, EGCG exerts an anti-tumor effect through the inhibition of key enzymes that participate in the glycolytic pathway and the suppression of glucose metabolism.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is an escalating global epidemic caused by an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, has been reported to be conducive to preventing obesity and alleviating obesity-related chronic diseases. However, the role of EGCG in energy metabolism disorders and central nervous system dysfunction induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EGCG on brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and neuroinflammation in HFD-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. Mice were randomly divided into four groups with different diets: normal chow diet (NCD), normal chow diet supplemented with 1% EGCG (NCD + EGCG), high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet supplemented with 1% EGCG (HFD + EGCG). Investigations based on a four-week experiment were carried out including the BAT activity, energy consumption, mRNA expression of major inflammatory cytokines in the hypothalamus, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, and immunofluorescence staining of microglial marker Iba1 in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). Experimental results demonstrated that dietary supplementation of EGCG significantly inhibited HFD-induced obesity by enhancing BAT thermogenesis, and attenuated the hypothalamic inflammation and microglia overactivation by regulating the NF-\u03baB and STAT3 signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "White tea is considered as a special kind of tea not only for its simplest process, but also for its endurable storage. However, little studies have been done about the changes of white tea with increasing aging time, including its composition and health-imparting effects. In the present work, white tea aged 1\u00a0year (WT-1), 3\u00a0years (WT-3), and 5\u00a0years (WT-5) were collected. Their major chemical compounds, antioxidant activities, and inhibitory effects on \u03b1-Amylase and \u03b1-Glucosidase were evaluated. Results showed that white tea of different storage time showed good antioxidant activity in DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assay, which decreases with the prolongation of storage time. The inhibitory effects on \u03b1-Amylase and \u03b1-Glucosidase which are key enzymes related to type II diabetes in vitro, are also observed in the similar trend. Meanwhile, prolongation of storage time decreased the content of polyphenols, the main bioactive compounds in tea, which may lead to decrease in the activities investigated.",

        "abstract": "Phenolics are the main bioactive components in tea and greatly contribute to human health. Three phenolic-enriched extracts, the ethyl acetate fraction (TEF), n-butanol fraction (TBF), and water fraction (TWF), were obtained from Tieguanyin oolong tea, which is considered a typical type of semi-fermented tea. The chemicals in the extracts and their antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity against 4T1 breast cancer cells were investigated in the present work. TEF was found to have the highest contents of phenolics, flavonoids, procyanidins, sugars, and catechin monomers. Meanwhile, TEF exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity, which may be due to its abundant bioactive compounds, as validated by Pearson correlation and hierarchical clustering analysis. Furthermore, TEF showed greater inhibition of the growth of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells than TBF and TWF. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fermentation during the processing of oolong tea causes many alterations in polyphenols, leading to different bioactivities. In the present work, three phenolic-enriched extracts, the ethyl acetate fraction (TEF), n-butanol fraction (TBF), and water fraction (TWF), were obtained from Tieguanyin oolong tea. Further tests showed that TEF and TBF from Tieguanyin oolong tea possessed remarkable antioxidant activity and inhibitory potential inhibition of the growth of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells in vitro due to their main bioactive compounds, including phenolics and flavonoids. Thus, the phenolic-enriched extracts from Tieguanyin tea are expected to have a potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industries after further study.",

        "abstract": "Matcha is a kind of powdered green tea produced by grinding with a stone mill. In the present study, the preventive effects of the aqueous extract (water-soluble) and residue (water-insoluble) of Matcha on the antioxidant status and lipid and glucose levels in mice fed a high-fat diet were investigated. Mice were fed seven different experimental diets for 4 weeks: a normal diet control (NC), a high-fat diet (HF), a high-fat diet with 0.025% Matcha (MLD), a high-fat diet with 0.05% Matcha (MMD), a high-fat diet with 0.075% Matcha (MHD), a high-fat diet with 0.05% Matcha aqueous extracts (ME), and a high-fat diet with 0.05% Matcha residues (MR). It was found that serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels of the MHD group were significantly decreased compared to those of the HF group. Furthermore, in the MHD group, the level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was elevated, on the contrary the level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was suppressed. Moreover, Matcha could significantly lower the blood glucose levels, and improve the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MAD) contents both in serum and liver; besides, the serum GSH-Px activity indicated that the oxidative stress caused by HF could be reversed by administration of Matcha. These findings suggest that Matcha has beneficial effects through the suppression of the blood glucose (BG) accumulation and promotion of the lipid metabolism and antioxidant activities. Moreover, the water-insoluble part of Matcha is suggested to play an important role in the suppression of diet-induced high levels of lipid and glucose.",

The existence of abundant Lewis bases can increase the chemical affinity to carbon dioxide, thus resulting in their high CO2 capture ability. Additionally, the heterogeneous Zn(PZDC)(ATZ) catalyst facilitated the CO2 coupling reaction of various epoxides into cyclic carbonates with the aid of Bu4NBr under solvent-free conditions (90 \u00b0C, 1 MPa, 6 h); besides, a high TON (131.0) and TOF (21.8 h\u22121) of propylene carbonates were obtained. Furthermore, the Zn(PZDC)(ATZ) catalyst also showed good chemical stability and recyclability for seven cycles without a significant catalytic loss. Whatu0027s more, a plausible catalytic mechanism of synergistic effects derived from Zn(PZDC)(ATZ)/Bu4NBr catalysts for CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate was proposed.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:  To resolve a controversy involving the therapeutic impact of antiangiogenic drugs and particularly antibodies targeting the VEGF pathway, namely, a body of preclinical mouse therapy studies showing such drugs can promote invasion and/or distant metastasis when used as monotherapies. In contrast, clinical studies have not shown such promalignancy effects. However, most such clinical studies have involved patients also treated with concurrent chemotherapy highlighting the possibility that chemotherapy may prevent any potential promalignancy effect caused by an antiangiogenic drug treatment.   Experimental Design:  The impact of antiangiogenic therapy using DC101, an antibody targeting mouse VEGFR-2 with or without concurrent chemotherapy was assessed in multiple human breast cancer xenograft models, where impact on orthotopic primary tumors was evaluated. Metastasis was also assessed during adjuvant and neoadjuvant plus adjuvant therapy, after surgical resection of primary tumors, with the same combination therapies.   Results:  Antiangiogenic therapy, while blunting tumor volume growth, was found to increase local invasion in multiple primary tumor models, including a patient-derived xenograft, but this effect was blocked by concurrent chemotherapy. Similarly, the combination of paclitaxel with DC101 caused a marked reduction of micro- or macrometastatic disease in contrast to DC101 monotherapy, which was associated with small increases in metastatic disease.   Conclusions:  Conventional wisdom is that targeted biologic antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab when used with chemotherapy increase the efficacy of the chemotherapy treatment. Our results suggest the reverse may be true as well\u2014chemotherapy may improve the impact of antiangiogenic drug treatment and, as a result, overall efficacy.

        "abstract": "Metronomic chemotherapy has shown promising activity in numerous preclinical studies and also some phase II clinical studies involving various tumor types, and is currently undergoing phase III trial evaluation. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive histological subtype with limited treatment options and very poor prognosis following progression after standard chemotherapeutic regimens. Herein, we evaluated the potential therapeutic impact and molecular mechanisms of topotecan administered in a continuous low-dose metronomic (LDM) manner, alone or in concurrent combination with pazopanib, an antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in a triple-negative, primary and metastatic breast cancer orthotopic model; potential molecular mechanisms of efficacy were also studied, especially the impact of hypoxic conditions. The combination of metronomic topotecan and pazopanib significantly enhanced antitumor activity compared to monotherapy with either drug and prolonged survival, even in the advanced metastatic survival setting, with a marked decrease in tumor vascularity, proliferative index, and the induction of apoptosis. Significant changes in tumor angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, HIF1\u03b1 levels, HIF-1 target genes and ABCG2 were found both in vitro and in tumor tissue. Notably, the pazopanib and metronomic topotecan combination treatment inhibited expression of HIF1\u03b1 and ABCG2 genes in cells grown under hypoxic conditions, and this was associated with an increased intracellular concentration of the active form of topotecan. Our results suggest a potential novel therapeutic option for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Temsirolimus maintenance therapy after docetaxel induction chemotherapyis safe in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, although biochemical or tumor responses are rare;does not diminish quality of life; anddelays radiological and/or symptomatic progression by approximately 6 months.No standard therapy is available for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have responded to docetaxel and do not yet have disease progression. Hence, we designed a single-arm phase II trial to explore whether the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus can maintain the response to docetaxel without compromising quality of life.After successful docetaxel induction (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks; 6-10 cycles), 21 CRPC patients underwent temsirolimus maintenance treatment (25 mg weekly; 4 weeks per cycle). The primary endpoint was the time to treatment failure (TTTF) (i.e., radiological and/or symptomatic progression). The secondary endpoints included the tumor response rate (RECIST 1.0), safety (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P]), pain (Present Pain Intensity [PPI] scale), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) parameters, including time to PSA progression (TTPP) according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group criteria, and serial enumeration of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs).Patients received a median of 7 cycles of temsirolimus (range, 1-28), resulting in a median TTTF of 24.3 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.1-33.0), 1 partial tumor response (4.8%), 1 PSA response (4.8%), and a median TTPP of 12.2 weeks (95% CI, 7.8-23.9). Grade 3-4 adverse events were infrequent, and FACT-P and PPI scores remained stable during treatment. CECs did not predict clinical benefit, and CEPs were not consistently detectable.Temsirolimus maintenance therapy after successful docetaxel induction is feasible, does not adversely affect quality of life, and, in this exploratory single-arm phase II study, resulted in a median TTTF of 24.3 weeks.",

Reduced tumor vessel numbers and function following antiangiogenic therapy may also affect intratumoral delivery of concurrently administered chemotherapy. Nonetheless, combining chemotherapy and bevacizumab can lead to improved response rates, progression-free survival, and sometimes overall survival, the extent of which can partly depend on the chemotherapy backbone. A rational, complementing chemotherapy partner for combination with bevacizumab would not only reduce HIF-1\u03b1 to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance, but also improve tumor perfusion to maintain intratumoral drug delivery. Here we evaluated bevacizumab and CRLX101, an investigational nanoparticle-drug conjugate containing camptothecin, in preclinical mouse models of orthotopic primary triple-negative breast tumor xenografts, including a patient-derived xenograft. We also evaluated long-term efficacy of CRLX101 and bevacizumab to treat post-surgical, advanced metastatic breast cancer in mice. CRLX101 alone and combined with bevacizumab was highly efficacious, leading to complete tumor regressions, reduced metastasis, and greatly extended survival of mice with metastatic disease. Moreover, CRLX101 led to improved tumor perfusion and reduced hypoxia, as measured by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. CRLX101 durably suppressed HIF-1\u03b1, thus potentially counteracting undesirable effects of elevated tumor hypoxia caused by bevacizumab. Our preclinical results show pairing a potent cytotoxic nanoparticle chemotherapeutic that complements and improves concurrent antiangiogenic therapy may be a promising treatment strategy for metastatic breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Despite the approval of seven different VEGF-pathway targeting agents, such as bevacizumab, for ten different cancer types, VEGF inhibition has shown only modest survival benefits - especially in breast cancer. One hypothesis for this is the adaptive resistance that emerges, such as increased tumor hypoxia and elevated hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which up-regulates genes causing tumor angiogenesis, resistance and metastasis. Here we evaluated bevacizumab paired with a potent cytotoxic investigational drug called CRLX101, a nanoparticle-drug conjugate containing the payload camptothecin that secondarily suppresses HIF-1\u03b1. In a preclinical mouse model of primary human breast tumor xenografts grown in the mammary fat pad after cell-line implantation, CRLX101 monotherapy was highly efficacious. More importantly, CRLX101 with bevacizumab resulted in dramatic primary tumor shrinkages and greatly improved mice survival, despite bevacizumab alone having no activity in this model. This potent anti-tumor efficacy was further confirmed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, where again CRLX101 and bevacizumab led to obvious shrinkage of established primary tumors. HIF-1\u03b1 suppression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry while changes in tumor hypoxia and perfusion were evaluated using photoacoustic imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, respectively. To better reflect the clinical treatment setting, the combination was next evaluated in our preclinical model of post-surgical, overt metastatic disease. Both CRLX101 monotherapy and CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab showed shrinkage of existing metastatic masses and prevented the emergence of new metastases. In conclusion, we showed that pairing an anti-angiogenic agent with a potent chemotherapy backbone that is able to suppress HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulation induced by anti-angiogenic therapy greatly improve efficacy in both primary and metastatic breast cancer models. The data from these preclinical experiments demonstrate that further research of the combination of bevacizumab and other anti-angiogenic drugs with CRLX101 is warranted in solid tumors.

        "abstract": "A recurring historical finding in cancer drug development is encouraging anti-tumor effects observed in tumor-bearing mice which fail to translate into the clinic. An intriguing exception to this pattern is immune checkpoint therapy, as the sustained tumor regressions observed in subsets of cancer patients are rare in mice. Reasoning that this may be due in part to relatively low mutational loads of mouse tumors, we mutagenized transplantable mouse tumor cell lines EMT-6/P, B16F1, RENCA, CT26 and MC38 in vitro with methylnitro-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) and tested their responsiveness to PD-L1 blockade. Exome sequencing confirmed an increase in somatic mutations by mutagen treatment, an effect mimicked in EMT-6 variants chronically exposed in vivo to cisplatin or cyclophosphamide. Certain mutagenized variants of B16F1, EMT-6/P, CT26 and MC38 (but not RENCA) were more immunogenic than their parents, yet anti-PD-L1 sensitization developed only in some EMT-6/P and B16F1 variants. Treatment response patterns corresponded with changes in immune cell infiltration and especially increases in CD8+ T cells. Chronically cisplatin-exposed EMT-6 variants were also more responsive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Though tumor PD-L1 expression was upregulated in in vivo chemotherapy exposed variants, PD-L1 expression levels were not consistently associated with anti-PD-L1 treatment activity across mutagenized or chemotherapy-exposed variants. In summary, mutagenized and more immunogenic mouse tumors were not universally sensitized to PD-L1 blockade. Chemically mutagenized variants may be useful to evaluate the impact of immunologically 'hot' or 'cold' tumors with a high mutational load - to which certain chemotherapy agents may contribute - on immunotherapy outcomes.",

As a result of toxicity, the clinical failures or the modest benefits associated with antiangiogenic TKI therapy may be related in some cases to suboptimal drug dosing and scheduling, thereby facilitating resistance. Most antiangiogenic TKIs, including pazopanib, are administered on a continuous daily basis. Here, instead, we evaluated the impact of increasing the dose and administering the drug intermittently. The rationale is that using such protocols, antitumor efficacy could be enhanced by direct tumor cell targeting effects in addition to inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. To test this, we employed two human tumor xenograft models, both of which manifest intrinsic resistance to pazopanib when it is administered continuously: the VHL-wildtype SN12-PM6-1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the metastatic MDA-MB-231/LM2-4 variant breast cancer cell line, when treated as distant metastases. We evaluated four different doses and schedules of pazopanib in the context of primary tumors and advanced metastatic disease, in both models. The RCC model was not converted to drug sensitivity using the intermittent protocol. Using these protocols did not enhance the efficacy when treating primary LM2-4 tumors. However, one of the high-dose intermittent pazopanib protocols increased median survival when treating advanced metastatic disease. In conclusion, these results overall suggest that primary tumors showing sensitivity to continuous pazopanib treatment may predict response to this drug when given at high doses intermittently in the context of advanced metastatic disease, that are otherwise resistant to the conventional protocol.",

        "abstract": "Several approaches are being evaluated to improve the historically limited value of studying transplanted primary tumors derived by injection of cells from established cell lines for predicting subsequent cancer therapy outcomes in patients and clinical trials. These approaches include use of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of spontaneous tumors, or patient tumor tissue derived xenografts (PDXs). Almost all such therapy studies utilizing such models involve treatment of established primary tumors. An alternative approach we have developed involves transplanted human tumor xenografts derived from established cell lines to treat mice with overt visceral metastases after primary tumor resection. The rationale is to mimic the more challenging circumstance of treating patients with late stage metastatic disease. These metastatic models entail prior in vivo selection of heritable, phenotypically stable variants with increased aggressiveness for spontaneous metastasis; they were derived by orthotopic injection of tumor cells followed by primary tumor resection and serial selection of distant spontaneous metastases, from which variant cell lines having a more aggressive heritable metastatic phenotype were established. We attempted to adopt this strategy for breast cancer PDXs. We studied five breast cancer PDXs, with the emphasis on two, called HCI-001 and HCI-002, both derived from triple negative breast cancer patients. However significant technical obstacles were encountered. These include the inherent slow growth rates of PDXs, the rarity of overt spontaneous metastases (detected in only 3 of 144 mice), very high rates of tumor regrowths at the primary tumor resection site, the failure of the few human PDX metastases isolated to manifest a more aggressive metastatic phenotype upon re-transplantation into new hosts, and the formation of metastases which were derived from de novo mouse thymomas arising in aged SCID mice that we used for the experiments. We discuss several possible strategies that may be employed to overcome these limitations. Uncovering the basis of the failure to detect a high rate of overt spontaneous distant metastases having a heritable phenotype in PDX models may reveal new insights into the biology and treatment of advanced metastatic disease.

        "abstract": "Conventional chemotherapy drugs administered at a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) remains the backbone for treating most cancers. Low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy, which utilizes lower, less toxic, doses given on a close regular basis over prolonged periods, is an alternative and better tolerated potential strategy to improve chemotherapy. LDM chemotherapy has been evaluated preclinically and clinically and has shown therapeutic benefit, in both early and advanced stage metastatic disease, especially when used as a maintenance therapy. However, knowledge about the anti-tumor mechanisms by which LDM chemotherapy acts remain limited. Here we characterized the effects of LDM and MTD capecitabine therapy on tumor and host cells using high-throughput systems approaches involving mass spectrometry flow cytometry and automated cell imaging followed by in vivo analyses of such therapies. An increase in myeloid and T regulatory cells and a decrease in NK and T cytotoxic cells were found in MTD-capecitabine-treated tumors compared to LDM-capecitbine-treated tumors. Plasma from MTD capecitabine-treated mice induced a more tumorigenic and metastatic profile in both breast and colon carcinoma cells than plasma from mice treated with LDM capecitabine. These results correlated, in part, with in vivo studies using models of human or mouse advanced metastatic disease, where the therapeutic advantage of MTD capecitabine was limited despite a substantial initial anti-tumor activity found in the primary tumor setting. Overall these results implicate a possible contribution of immunological host effects in accounting for the therapeutic limitations of MTD compared to LDM capecitabine.",

Data analyses based on a survey of 1, 202 online Chinese show that social media use is significantly related to both public discourse and civic engagement. In addition, political interest has a consistent, strong modification on the role of social media use in public discourse and civic engagement.

        "abstract": "Drawing on the resource model of political participation, this study examines the ways in which various resources, including money, computer and Internet access, Internet skills, and civic skills predict Chinese citizens\u2019 political participation online. The results showed that income was a significant predictor of online political participation regardless of whether it was by using the Internet to contact governmental officials, monitoring public policies online, or participating in online protests. Civic skills also consistently predicted the three forms of online political participation. Computer and Internet access, as well as Internet skills, were significant predictors of some forms of online political participation, but not all of them. Political interest positively moderated the association between income and each of the three dependent variables. The theoretical and empirical implications of these results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "By using American state-level data from 1999 to 2008, this article explores how the recent immigrant influx has influenced public welfare spending in the American states. By integrating the race/ethnicity and globalization compensation theory, I hypothesize that immigration will increase welfare spending in states with a bleak job market and exclusive state immigrant welfare policy; in contrast, immigration will decrease welfare spending in states with a good job market and inclusive state immigrant welfare policy. Empirical tests show evidence for both hypotheses, suggesting that the applicability of general political science theories depends on a combination of state policy and economic contexts.",

Temporally, such two-photon state exhibits mode-locked pulse train. The two-photon pulse duration reaches 4.2 fs when the frequency comb is centered at 800 nm and covers 442 nm. The HOM interference of the mode-locked biphoton approaches a 1.26-\u03bcm dip and exhibits a reappearance of dip and peak, which can be taken as a new scheme for engineering quantum light source. Furthermore, we also design another aperiodically poled crystal to generate two sets of frequency combs. The HOM interference will appear as a revival of spatial beatings.

In this work we develop and demonstrate a lensless quantum ghost imaging by engineering quadratic nonlinear photonic crystals. With a transverse parabolic domain modulation introduced into the lithium tantalate crystal, the entangled photon pairs generated from parametric down-conversion will self-focus. Therefore we can dispense with additional lenses to construct imaging in a nonlocal way. The lensless imaging is found to follow a specific imaging formula where the effective focal length is determined by the domain modulation and pump wavelength. Additionally, two nonlocal images can be retrieved when the entangled photon pair is generated under two concurrent noncollinear phase-matching geometries. Our work provides a principle and method to realize lensless ghost imaging, which may be extended to other wavelengths and stimulate new types of practical quantum technologies. \u00a9 2012 American Physical Society.",

        "abstract": "One promising technique for working toward practical photonic quantum technologies is to implement multiple operations on a monolithic chip, thereby improving stability, scalability and miniaturization. The on-chip spatial control of entangled photons will certainly benefit numerous applications, including quantum imaging, quantum lithography, quantum metrology and quantum computation. However, external optical elements are usually required to spatially control the entangled photons. Here we present the first experimental demonstration of on-chip spatial control of entangled photons, based on a domain-engineered nonlinear photonic crystal. We manipulate the entangled photons using the inherent properties of the crystal during the parametric downconversion, demonstrating two-photon focusing and beam-splitting from a periodically poled lithium tantalate crystal with a parabolic phase profile. These experimental results indicate that versatile and precise spatial control of entangled photons is achievable. Because they may be operated independent of any bulk optical elements, domain-engineered nonlinear photonic crystals may prove to be a valuable ingredient in on-chip integrated quantum optics. \u00a9 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Both the propagation constant and the nonlinearity in the array are designed to possess a periodical modulation along the propagation direction. This ensures that the photon pairs can be generated efficiently through the quasi-phase-matching spontaneous parametric down conversion by holding the spatial EPR entanglement in the fashion of correlated position and anticorrelated momentum. The Schmidt number which denotes the degree of EPR entanglement is calculated and it can approach a high value when the number of illuminated waveguide channels and the length of the waveguide array are properly chosen. These results suggest the quadratic waveguide array as a compact platform for engineering photonic quantum states in a high-dimensional Hilbert space.",

        "title": "Resolution of ghost imaging with entangled photons for different types of momentum correlation",
        "abstract": "We present an analytical analysis of the spatial resolution of quantum ghost imaging implemented by entangled photons from a general, spontaneously parametric, down-conversion process. We find that the resolution is affected by both the pump beam waist and the nonlinear crystal length. Hence, we determined a method to improve the resolution for a certain imaging setup. It should be noted that the resolution is not uniquely related to the degree of entanglement of the photon pair since the resolution can be optimized for a certain degree of entanglement. For certain types of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states\u2014\u2014namely the momentum-correlated or momentum-positively correlated states\u2014\u2014the resolution exhibits a simpler relationship with the pump beam waist and crystal length. Further, a vivid numerical simulation of ghost imaging is presented for different types of EPR states, which supports our analysis. This work discusses applicable references to the applications of quantum ghost imaging.",

The MPC-EPR state is identified by measuring the momentum and position correlations at the Fourier plane and imaging plane of the PPLT crystal end face, respectively, showing a variance product (\u0394x+)2(\u0394p\u2212)2=0.14\u00b10.02\u210f2, which fulfills the entanglement criterion. The engineering of such an entangled state will bring interest to not only fundamental quantum physics but also the applied quantum technologies, such as quantum imaging, etc.",

        "abstract": "Multipartite quantum entanglement is a powerful resource for enriching the functionality of quantum computation and quantum communication. In this Letter, we propose a new method to generate a two-photon multipath Dicke state with concurrent spontaneous parametric downconversion processes from a single periodically poled nonlinear photonic crystal. We design the poling structure to produce a three-path Dicke state where three quasi-phase-matching conditions are fulfilled simultaneously by a hybrid one- and two-dimensionally poled nonlinear photonic crystal. We use genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence to quantify the entanglement of the Dicke state. Using a more complicated poling configuration like multiple-periodically poled two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal, we can also produce four-path, five-path, or multipath Dicke states by a single crystal. The multiple-periodically poled two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal provides a new method, to the best of our knowledge, for the integrated generation of multipartite quantum light sources.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly human malignant diseases and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China. Gemcitabine is the only first-line chemotherapeutic agent used for the palliative treatment of patients with PDAC, but chemo-resistance limits their efficacy. Here, we showed that miR-125a was up-regulated in chemo-resistant SW1990GZ cells when compared with SW1990 cells. Over-expression of miR-125a increased the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in SW1990 cells, while down-regulation of miR-125a in SW1990GZ cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine. By using bioinformatics analysis tool (Targetscan), the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of A20 gene was found to be a target of miR-125a. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that A20 3'UTR is a direct target of miR-125a. Over-expression of A20 in SW1990 cells increased chemo-sensitivity to gemcitabine, while knockdown of A20 in SW1990 cells promoted the chemo-resistance to gemcitabine. Finally, the expression level of miR-125a in pancreatic cancer tissues from chemo-sensitive patients was significantly lower than that from chemo-resistant patients, and was inversely correlated with the A20 mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-125a promotes chemo-resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cells through targeting A20, which may provide novel therapeutic targets or molecular biomarkers for cancer therapy and improve tumor diagnosis or predictions of therapeutic responses.",

Tremendous experimental effort has been devoted to generating multiparticle entanglement with a growing number of qubits6-16. So far, up to six spatially separated single photons10-14 have been entangled based on parametric downconversion17. Multiple degrees of freedom of a single photon have been exploited to generate forms of hyper-entangled states18,19. Here, using new ultra-bright sources of entangled photon pairs20, an eight-photon interferometer and post-selection detection, we demonstrate for the first time the creation of an eight-photon Schr\u00f6dinger cat state 1 with genuine multipartite entanglement. The ability to control eight individual photons represents a step towards optical quantum computation, and will enable new experiments on, for example, quantum simulation 21,22, topological error correction23 and testing entanglement dynamics under decoherence24. \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

        "abstract": "Microproteins are peptides composed of 100 amino acids (AA) or less, encoded by small open reading frames (smORFs). It has been demonstrated that microproteins participate in and regulate a wide range of functions in cells. However, the annotation and identification of microproteins is challenging in part owing to their low molecular weight, low abundancy, and hydrophobicity. These factors have led to the un-annotation of smORFs in genome processing and have made their identification at the protein level difficult. Large-scale enrichment of microproteins in proteogenomics has made it possible to efficiently identify microproteins and discover unannotated smORFs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we integrated four microprotein-specific enrichment strategies to enhance coverage. We identified 117 microproteins, verified 31 missing proteins (MPs), and discovered 3 novel smORFs. In total, 31 proteins were confirmed as MPs by spectrum quality checking. Three novel smORFs (YKL104W-A, YHR052C-B, and YHR054C-B) were reserved after spectrum quality checking, peptide synthesizing, homologue matching, etc. This study not only demonstrates that there are potential smORF candidates to be annotated in an extensively studied organism, but also presents an efficient strategy for the discovery of small MPs. All MS datasets have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008586 (Username: reviewer78780@ebi.ac.uk; Password: UNEbNk3j).",

        "abstract": "Investigations of missing proteins (MPs) are being endorsed by many bioanalytical strategies. We proposed that proteogenomics of testis tissue was a feasible approach to identify more MPs because testis tissues have higher gene expression levels. Here we combined proteomics and transcriptomics to survey gene expression in human testis tissues from three post-mortem individuals. Proteins were extracted and separated with glycine- and tricine-SDS-PAGE. A total of 9597 protein groups were identified; of these, 166 protein groups were listed as MPs, including 138 groups (83.1%) with transcriptional evidence. A total of 2948 proteins are designated as MPs, and 5.6% of these were identified in this study. The high incidence of MPs in testis tissue indicates that this is a rich resource for MPs. Functional category analysis revealed that the biological processes that testis MPs are mainly involved in are sexual reproduction and spermatogenesis. Some of the MPs are potentially involved in tumorgenesis in other ti...",

On the basis of the first and second Chinese Chromosome Proteome Database (CCPD 1.0 and 2.0) studies, we developed systematic enrichment strategies to identify MPs that fell into four classes: (1) low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, (2) membrane proteins, (3) proteins that contained various post-translational modifications (PTMs), and (4) nucleic acid-associated proteins. Of 8845 proteins identified in 7 data sets, 79 proteins were classified as MPs. Among data sets derived from different enrichment strategies, data sets for LMW and PTM yielded the most novel MPs. In addition, we found that some MPs were identified in multiple-data sets, which implied that tandem enrichments methods might improve the ability to identify MPs. Moreover, low expression at the transcription level was the major cause of the \u201cmissing\u201d of these MPs; however, MP...",

        "abstract": " peptide sequencing for large-scale proteomics remains challenging because of the lack of full coverage of ion series in tandem mass spectra. We developed a mirror protease of trypsin, acetylated LysargiNase (Ac-LysargiNase), with superior activity and stability. The mirror spectrum pairs derived from the Ac-LysargiNase and trypsin treated samples can generate full b and y ion series. The b and y ion series provide mutual complementarity and examination of each other, which allowed us to develop a novel algorithm, pNovoM, for  sequencing. Using pNovoM to sequence peptides of purified proteins, the accuracy of the sequence was close to 100%. More importantly, from a large-scale yeast proteome samples digested with trypsin and Ac-LysargiNase individually, 48% of all tandem mass spectra formed mirror spectrum pairs, 97% of which contained full coverage of ion series, resulting in precise de novo sequencing of full-length peptides by pNovoM. This enabled pNovoM to successfully sequence 21,249 peptides from 3,753 proteins and interpreted 44-152% more spectra than pNovo+ and PEAKS at a 5% FDR at the spectrum level. Moreover, the mirror protease strategy had an obvious advantage in sequencing long peptides. We believe that the combination of mirror protease strategy and pNovoM will be an effective approach for precision  sequencing on both single proteins and proteome samples.",

Mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics technology is currently one of the mainstream methods for proteomics research. With this method, proteins need to be digested to peptides by site-specific proteases before they can be detected with mass spectrometry. Therefore, site-specific proteases played key roles in this process and so far, a variety of specific proteases have been developed and used in proteomics study. Particularly, the identification, characterization and development of proteases that cleave at the N-termini of corresponding amino acid residues, which are just mirrors to those of typical C-termini proteases, provide novel tools for proteomics analysis. In this review, we summarized the proprieties of LysargiNase, a most recently identified mirror trypsin, and its applications in proteomics research to promote its more widespread usage.",

SPs participate in a wide range of functions in cells, including gene regulating, cell signaling and metabolism. However, most annotated SPs in all living organisms are currently lacking expression evidence at the protein level and regarded as missing proteins (MPs). High efficient SPs identification is the prerequisite for their functional study and contribution to MPs searching. In this study, we identified 72 SPs and successfully validated 9 MPs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on SPs enrichment strategy. In-depth analysis showed that the missing factors of MPs were low molecular weight, low abundant, hydrophobicity, lower codon usage bias and unstable. The small protein-based enrichment can be used as MPs searching strategy, which might provide the foundation for their further function research.",

However, these proteins are difficult to be detected due to their low abundance, short half-life. In this study, ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) were constructed to purify the ubiquitinated proteins from Hep3B cells. Ubiquitinated proteins and sites were detected by LC-MS/MS. A total of 1 900 potential ubiquitinated proteins were identified. Among them, 158 ubiquitinated sites were identified, belonging to 102 proteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the enriched pathways of ubiquitinated proteins were closely related to tumor occurrence and development. The dysfunction of ubiquitin-proteasome has a high correlation with cell signaling and extracellular matrix changing in tumor cells.",

However, reports on metal-mediated chemical methods towards native peptides especially non-engineering protein modification under mild conditions are still limited. Herein, we describe a novel Cu(ii)-mediated strategy for the conjugation of thioesters/thioacids to peptides under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance. Based on this strategy, polypeptides, even peptide-based fluorescent probes, can be efficiently constructed. Finally, the selective modification of lysine residues of native Ub with thioesters could be realized and complete conjugation of Ub could be achieved even under equivalent Cu(ii). These promising results could greatly expand Cu(ii)-mediated reaction strategies on chemical biology and molecular imaging.",

        "abstract": "Neurogenesis is essential for proper brain formation and function, and abnormal neural proliferation is an underlying neuropathology of many brain disorders. Recent advances on adult neurogenesis demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs) at the subventricular zone (SVZ) are largely derived during mid-embryonic neurogenesis from a subset of cells, which slow down in their pace of cell division, become quiescent cells and can be reactivated in need. The NSCs at birth constitute the stem cell pool for both postnatal oligodendrogenesis and adult neurogenesis. However, little is known about factors that control the size of NSC pool. The article published in Stem Cells on Jun 14, 2016 by Liu and colleagues described a member of the Unc-51-like serine/threonine kinase family, Ulk4, which plays a critical role in regulating the NSC pool size. Authors presented evidence of cell cycle-dependent Ulk4 expression  and , and reduced NSC pool in targetedly disrupted  newborn mice, with disturbed pathways of cell cycle regulation and WNT signaling (Fig. 1), suggesting that ULK4 may be associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric as well as neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "In 2012, the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) launched an investigation for missing proteins (MPs) to complete the human proteome project (HPP). The majority of the MPs were distributed in low molecular weight (LMW) ranges, especially from 0-40 kDa. LMW protein identification is challenging, owing to their short length, low abundance, and hydrophobicity. Furthermore, many sequences from Trypsin digestion are unlikely to yield detectable peptides or reasonable quality of MS2 spectrum. Therefore, we focused on small MPs by combining LMW protein enrichment and a pair of complementary proteases strategy with Trypsin and LysargiNase for human testis samples. In-depth testis LMW protein profiling resulted in the identification of 4,063 proteins, of which 2,565 were LMW proteins, and 1,130 had paired of peptides generated from both of the Trypsin and LysargiNase. This provided additional mass spectral evidence for further verification of small MPs. Finally, two MPs were verified from the seven MP candidates. One of them, Q8N688 was verified with two series of continuous and complementary b/y-product ions from the paired of spectra for tryptic and LysargiNase digested peptides after the \"mirror spectrum\" matching. This make the confident identification of the representative peptides for the target MPs. On another hand, the two verified peptides for Q86WR6 were identified with the same strategy from the gel-separation and gel-elution sample, respectively. Although the other five MP candidates showed high quality spectra, they could not be sufficiently distinguished as PE1s, and require further verification. All MS datasets have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010093 (Username: reviewer01467@ebi.ac.uk; Password: 3UNjNWUA).",

        "abstract": "Subsequent to conducting the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project, we have focused on human testis-enriched missing proteins (MPs) since 2015. To enhance protein coverage, a multi-protease strategy was used for separation of samples by 10% SDS-PAGE. To improve separating efficiency, a high-pH reverse phase (RP) separation strategy was applied to fractionate complex samples in this study. A total of 11,558 proteins were identified, which is the largest proteome dataset for single human tissue sample so far. Based on this large-scale dataset, we verified 14 MPs (PE2) in neXtProt (2018-01) after spectrum quality analysis, isobaric post-translational modification and single amino acid variant (SAAV) filtering, and synthesized peptide matching. Tissue expression analysis showed that 3 of 14 MPs were testis-specific proteins. Functional analysis showed that 10 of 14 MPs were closely related to liver tumor, liver carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Another 100 MPs were listed as candidates, but required additional verification information.

Here, we revealed that GSTZ1-1, the enzyme in phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism, is downregulated in HCC, and its expression was negatively correlated with IGF1R. Mechanistically, GSTZ1-1 deficiency led to succinylacetone accumulation, alkylation modification of KEAP1, and NRF2 activation, thus promoting IGF1R transcription by recruiting SP1 to its promoter. Moreover, inhibition of IGF1R or NRF2 significantly inhibited tumor-promoting effects of GSTZ1 knockout in\u00a0vivo. These findings establish succinylacetone as an oncometabolite, and GSTZ1-1 as an important tumor suppressor by inhibiting NRF2/IGF1R axis in HCC. Targeting NRF2 or IGF1R may be a promising treatment approach for this subset HCC.",

The depth of the grating is nearly equal to 4 \ufffd\ufffdm, the diffraction orders from -10 to 10 has uniform intensity, such a grating can be used as multi-splitter. The grating can be concave or convex. The method presented in this paper is not only used to fabricate parabolic grating, but also has been used to generate other continuous relief patterns with line-symmetry and rotation-symmetry. Interesting experimental results are given. It is proved that this method is useful for the making of microoptics elements with continuous relief.",

        "abstract": "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) plays an important role in the progression of renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Accumulating evidence supports a crucial effect of early growth response factor 1 (Egr1) on renal fibrosis in DN, but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Here, we explored the aggravating role of Egr1 and identified microRNA-181a-5p (miR-181a-5p) as an upstream regulator of Egr1 in TIF of DN. We demonstrated that overexpression of Egr1 enhanced, whereas small interfering RNA targeting Egr1 decreased the expressions of transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and fibrosis-related genes including fibronectin and collagen I in human proximal tubule cell line (HK-2) cells. We then found that miR-181a-5p expression was down-regulated, accompanied by the corresponding up-regulation of Egr1, TGF-\u03b21, fibronectin and collagen I in renal tissues of type 2 diabetic Otsuka-Long-Evans-Tokushima-Fatty rats with DN, and that the expression of miR-181a-5p was negatively correlated with the level of Egr1 in HK-2 cells treated with high glucose. Furthermore, we identified that miR-181a-5p directly suppressed Egr1 to decrease the expressions of TGF-\u03b21, fibronectin and collagen I in HK-2 cells through targeting the 3' untranslated region of Egr1. The functional relevance of miR-181a-5p-induced Egr1 decrease was supported by inhibition and overexpression of miR-181a-5p in HK-2 cells. Thus, we concluded that aberrant Egr1 expression, which can be suppressed by miR-181a-5p directly, plays a crucial role in the progression of renal TIF in DN. This study indicates that targeting miR-181a-5p may be a novel therapeutic approach of DN.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Early growth response factor 1 (Egr1) plays a crucial role in cancer progression. However, its precise role in HCC has not been clear. Here, we identified the aggravating role of Egr1 in cell proliferation of HCC firstly. The expression of Egr1 was significantly increased in HCC tissues. Functionally, overexpression of Egr1 enhanced, whereas silenced Egr1 expression attenuated HCC cells proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, up-regulated Egr1 induced cell proliferation through activating Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21/Smad signaling pathway concomitantly with upregulation of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3. Secondly, miR-181a-5p was down-regulated in clinical HCC specimens and its expression was inversely correlated with Egr1 expression. Functionally, overexpression of miR-181a-5p inhibited, whereas decreased expression of miR-181a-5p promoted HCC cells proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-181a-5p overexpression directly suppressed Egr1, resulting in a down-regulated TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway. Besides, the silenced Egr1 expression could rescue the enhanced cell proliferation induced by miR-181a-5p inhibitor. Thus, we concluded that miR-181a-5p is a negative regulator of Egr1 that can suppress tumor proliferation in HCC through targeting Egr1/TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway, which may be a potential therapeutic approach of HCC.",

This study explored the contributions of miR-340 to the metabolic shift in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).MiR-340 expression was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. MiR-340 mimics, miR-340 inhibitor, and scramble small interfering RNA were transfected into SAS human tongue SCC cells to observe their effects on cell proliferation, colony formation, lactate secretion, and glucose uptake rate. Moreover, the relation between the level of miR-340 and glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) was investigated.The expression of miR-340 was decreased and thus induced a metabolic switch in oral cancer cells. The decrease in miR-340 increased Glut1 expression, leading to an increase in lactate secretion and glucose uptake rate. The altered metabolism induced by miR-340 resulted in the rapid proliferation of oral cancer cells.The findings suggest that miR-340 might act as a molecular switch that contributes to the regulation of glycolysis in OSCC by regulating Glut1 expression.",

        "abstract": "The effect of the initial dose of NaClO on the bacteriostasis of iron bacteria and the corrosion behavior of the pipeline steel for water distribution network was studied in an urban reclaimed water, which was sampled from a water recycle work in North China. Results show that the iron bacteria can be effectively inhibited by the addition of NaClO; the higher the dose is the longer time needs for the resurrection of the iron bacteria, therefore the better bacteriostasis may be realized; the existence of iron bacteria can significantly promote the corrosion of carbon steel,but with the extension of time, the corrosion of the steel may be suppressed to certain extent due to the formation of biofilms on the steel surface; in fact the addition of NaClO in the initial stage can suppress the corrosion of carbon steel induced by iron bacteria, however NaClO itself is also a corrosive medium to the steel, thus in the meanwhile a higher initial dose of NaClO may enhance the corrosion rate of the steel. Finally an optimal dose of NaClO 7 mg/L is acquired in terms of a compromise between the bacteriostasis in the reclaim water and the corrosion control of the steel.",

The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized catalysts were evaluated for the degradation of organic dyes. Our experimental results demonstrated that the greatly improved photocatalytic efficiency of the metal/TiO2 hierarchical nanocomposite arrays resulted from their high surface area and symmetrical arrangement. As a prospective approach for wastewater purification, our work not only enriches the synthetic methodology for TiO2, but also provides valuable knowledge about nanosized photocatalysts.",

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, 95% MWCNTs), graphene(GNP) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were selected which with the highest thermal conductivity. Ultrasonic parameters were selected as 285 W and 10 min. The best dispersant for MWCNTs, 95% MWCNTs, GNP and SWNTs was SDBS and optimal ratios (SDBS/ MWCNTs, 95% MWCNTs, GNP, SWNTs) were (0.5-4):1, (1-4):1, (0.25-2):1, (1-4):1 respectively. The dispersion stability of the four nanofluids from good to bad were 95% MWCNTs, MWCNTs, SWNTs and GNP in turn.

So in the work we fully analyze corrosion inhibition effect of BC-802BS corrosion inhibitor, including azole of 15% and benzotriazole (BTA) of 10%, on HSn70-1A copper. Electrochemical corrosion properties were investigated using polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in reclaimed water, up to 4 times concentration ratio; with concentration of corrosion inhibitor increasing, corrosion rate of HSn70-1A copper becomes smaller and smaller.",

Low impact development (LID) technology is utilized as an effective strategy to control urban stormwater runoff and pollution in the urban catchment. In this study, the impact of LUCC on runoff and pollutants in an urbanizing catchment of Guang-Ming New District in Shenzhen, China, were quantified using a dynamic rainfall-runoff model with the EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Based on the simulations and observations, the main objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the catchment runoff and pollutant variations with LUCC, (2) to select and optimize the appropriate layout of LID in a planning scenario for reducing the growth of runoff and pollutants under LUCC, (3) to assess the optimal planning schemes for land use/cover. The results showed that compared to 2013, the runoff volume, peak flow and pollution load of suspended solids (SS), and chemical oxygen demand increased by 35.1%, 33.6% and 248.5%, and 54.5% respectively in a traditional planning scenario. The assessment result of optimal planning of land use showed that annual rainfall control of land use for an optimal planning scenario with LID technology was 65%, and SS pollutant load reduction efficiency 65.6%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel method using the co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and biomass wastes (wood and paper) was adopted to synthesize chlorine on the surface of the char, and the synthesized Cl-Char composite was tested for removal of elemental mercury as a sorbent. The mercury removal efficiency of Cl-Char was much higher than that of raw char (2.5\u20135 times) and reached nearly 90% at 140\u00a0\u00b0C. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ion chromatography (IC) were used to characterize the sorbents derived from wastes. The introduction of PVC could increase the yield of sorbents, but it decreased the specific surface area of the sorbents because melted PVC adhered to the paper (or wood) molecules and blocked the development of the porous structure. The IC and XPS analysis results indicated that a synergistic effect occurred during the co-pyrolysis process and Cl released from PVC was partly fixed into the pyrolyzed chars to form C-Cl functional groups. This was the primary effective component for the mercury capture via chemical adsorption in contrast to simple physical adsorption on the chlorine-free char. The data also suggested that the existing forms of mercury on the used sorbent were HgCl x  via a temperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) experiment because the chemisorbed mercury species could be completely released from 200 to 400\u00a0\u00b0C. The elemental mercury removal efficiency increased as a function of temperature from 20\u00a0\u00b0C to 140\u00a0\u00b0C and then decreased at 170\u00a0\u00b0C. The presence of O 2  enhanced Hg 0  removal whereas SO 2  inhabited Hg 0  removal; NO had little influence on Hg 0  removal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   To better monitor and control Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants, quantification of Hg contents in coal is essential. Thermal decomposition is widely used to pretreat solid samples. The complete thermal release of Hg in coal samples is a premise for obtaining accurate results of measured Hg contents. The recommended heating temperature is 800\u00a0\u00b0C for coal samples. The research work in this paper has verified the existence of an abnormal phenomenon, where some Hg occurrences in typical coal at 800\u00a0\u00b0C could not fully decompose. The temperature-programmed pyrolysis was designed to validate the assumption and determine the optimum decomposition temperature. The results demonstrate that Hg combined with montmorillonite mineral fully decomposes at temperatures above 800\u00a0\u00b0C. The obtained results help to clarify the relationship between the decomposition temperature and Hg occurrence. The study offers good guidance to improve the accuracy of measured Hg contents by thermal decomposition, thus expanding the laboratory and industrial application.",

        "abstract": "A new method using non-thermal plasma to add Cl active sites on activated carbon method was proposed to improve the efficiency of activated carbon (AC) for mercury removal in flue gas. The experiments were carried out through a lab-scaled dielectric barrier discharge non-thermal plasma system and a vertical adsorption reactor. The results showed that the non-thermal plasma treatment with a small amount of Cl2 successfully added Cl active sites on AC and greatly increased the mercury removal efficiency of AC by chemisorption in a very short treatment time. The increase of Cl2 concentration for AC treatment promoted the efficiency of AC. The capacity of mercury adsorption positively correlated with the content of Cl2 for AC treatment, which depends on the number of Cl active sites on activated carbon. The treated AC maintained a high mercury removal efficiency within a temperature range of 30 \u00b0C to 210 \u00b0C. SO2, and H2O in flue gas inhibited mercury removal by AC. While HCl had a promotional effect. SEM and XPS analysis indicated the chemisorption of mercury was attributed to the C-Cl groups generated on AC surfaces during Cl2 non-thermal plasma treatment. The C-Cl as active sites had strong adsorption energy for mercury, which converted element mercury to HgCl2.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Anthropogenic Hg emission control has drawn worldwide attention along with enactments of strict legislation. In response to the need for mercury emission control from flue gases in coal combustion, studies have focused on mild pyrolysis as a promising technology for mercury removal before combustion. However, reaction pressure has not yet been studied, which might affect mercury removal in mild pyrolysis. In this paper, three types of powdery bituminous coal, Coals A-C, from the western plateau area of China, were studied. The core aim was to explore the effect of low reaction pressure on the efficiency of Hg removal. Data of the three coals under different pyrolysis pressures showed that reducing the pressure would improve the mercury removal rate and removal efficiency and that the effect was distinguished by coal type. The role of pyrolysis pressure in Hg removal was limited. When the residence time was long enough, the eventual Hg removal was dependent on the thermal decomposition temperature. These findings might be of some guidance for designing pyrolysis reactors. Furthermore, this article aims to provide some explanation about the mechanism and offer guidance for optimizing the technological parameters of Hg removal by mild pyrolysis.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast activation protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are the main type of cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs exert immunosuppressive activity, which can weaken the effects of cancer immunotherapy and mainly account for poor outcomes with therapeutic vaccines. To better target and destroy CAFs, a FAP\u03b1 vaccine using a modified vaccinia ankara (MVA) vector was constructed and used with a DNA vaccine reported in our previous work for heterologous prime-boost immunizations in mice. This strategy to generate anti-tumor immunity partly reduced 4T1 tumor growth through producing FAP\u03b1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in a preventive model, but the effect required improvement. Combining the FAP\u03b1-based cancer vaccines (CpVR-FAP/MVA-FAP) with cyclophosphamide (CY), which can be used not only as a chemotherapeutic but also an immunomodulatory agent to promote a shift from immunosuppression to immunopotentiation, resulted in markedly enhanced tumor growth inhibition compared with the CpVR-FAP/MVA-FAP group. This strategy achieved synergistic effects in a therapeutic model by improving the tumor inhibition rate by 2.5-fold (90.2%), significantly enhancing cellular immunity and prolonging the survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice by 35% compared with the PBS group. Furthermore, CAFs, stromal factors and immunosuppressive factors such as IL-10 and Tregs were also markedly decreased by the CY combination. These results indicated that FAP\u03b1-targeted MVA boosting in combination with CY is an effective approach to improving specific anti-tumor immune responses through overcoming immunosuppression. This study may offer important advances in research on clinical cancer immunotherapies by modulating immunosuppressive factors.",

        "abstract": "Cyclophosphamide (CY) is a DNA alkylating agent, which is widely used with other chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of various types of cancer. It can be used not only as a chemotherapeutic but also as an immunomodulatory agent to inhibit IL-10 expression and T regulatory cells (Tregs). Fibroblast activation protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. Immunotherapy based on FAP\u03b1, as a tumor stromal antigen, typically induces specific immune response targeting the tumor microenvironment. This study evaluated the efficacy of a previously unreported CY combination strategy to enhance the limited anti-tumor effect of a DNA vaccine targeting FAP\u03b1. The results suggested CY administration could promote the percentage of splenic CD8T cells and decrease the proportion of CD4\u2009\u2009CD25\u2009\u2009Foxp3Tregs in spleen. In tumor tissues, levels of immunosuppressive cytokines including IL-10 and CXCL-12 were also reduced. Meanwhile, the CY combination did not impair the FAP\u03b1-specific immunity induced by the DNA vaccine and further reduced tumor stromal factors. Most importantly, FAP-vaccinated mice also treated with CY chemotherapy showed a marked suppression of tumor growth (inhibition ratio =80%) and a prolongation of survival time. Thus, the combination of FAP\u03b1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy with CY offers new insights into improving cancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "Fibroblast activation protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of more than 90% of malignant epithelia carcinomas. CAFs are the main type of cells in the tumor microenvironment which offer nutrition and protection to the tumor and regulate immunosuppression. To eliminate CAFs, a vaccine targeting FAP\u03b1 may be used with a heterologous prime-boost strategy to enhance the FAP\u03b1-specific cellular immunity. Here, a FAP vaccine using a recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector was constructed as well as a DNA vaccine reported in our previous work. Although the DNA prime-rAd boost strategy enhanced FAP\u03b1-specific immune responses, improvement of anti-tumor immunity effects was not observed. Examination of immunosuppressive factors revealed that high expression of the IL-10 cytokine was considered the main cause of the failure of the prime-boost strategy. However, heterologous vaccination in combination with a low-dose of cyclophosphamide (CY), which was reported to reduce IL-10 production and promote a shift from immunosuppression to immunopotentiation, resulted in enhanced effects in terms of numbers of effector T cells and tumor growth inhibition rates, compared to the CY alone or DNA alone group. Tumor growth was inhibited markedly when the prime-boost strategy was combined with CY in both the prophylactic and therapeutic settings and the survival time of 4T1 tumor bearing mice was also prolonged significantly. With the reduction of IL-10, enhancement of the anti-tumor effect by the prime-boost strategy was observed. These results suggest that FAP\u03b1-targeted rAd boosting in combination with CY is an attractive approach to overcoming immunosuppression in cancer vaccines.",

The current study was designed to investigate antihyperlipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of selenium modified exopolysaccharide of Lachnum sp. (SeLEP-1b) on high-fat induced mice model. Nitric acid-sodium selenite (HNO-NaSeO) method was used to selenize pure LEP-1b. FT-IR and C NMR results confirmed the modification of LEP-1b into SeLEP-1b. The main structure of SeLEP-1b was similar to the original structure of native LEP-1b and Se(O)OH group was attached to the O-6 position of C-6 in LEP-1b. Oral administration of LEP-1b and SeLEP-1b (200mg/kg) notably reduced the serum and liver lipids, atherogenic index, and enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes of hyperlipidemic mice, aswell improved the histopathological status of hepatic tissues. Hence, SeLEP-1b showed better effects than LEP-1b at the same doses. SeLEP-1b demonstrated promising lipid-lowering and liver protecting activities, which may be considered as a novel compound to treat hyperlipidemia and also act as a hepatoprotective agent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A novel exopolysaccharide (LEP-1) was isolated from the fermented broth of  Lachnum  YM268 through ethanol precipitation, deproteinization, decolorization and purification. The physicochemical properties of LEP-1 were determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS), and 1D- and 2D-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). LEP-1 was a heteropolysaccharide with an average molecular weight of 473\u00a0kDa, which consisted of glucose (Glc) and mannose (Man) in a molar ratio of 1.3:1.0. The backbone of LEP-1 was composed of \u21921)-\u03b1-Man p -(3,6\u2192, \u21922)-\u03b1-Man p -(6\u2192, \u21921)-\u03b1-Glc p -(6\u2192 and \u21921)-\u03b2-Glc p -(6\u2192, and its branches consisted of \u21921)-\u03b2-Glc p , \u21921)-\u03b1-Man p -(3,6\u2192 and \u21922)-\u03b1-Man p -(6\u2192. The analysis of the chain conformation showed that LEP-1 had no triple helical structure. The effects of LEP-1 on the hematological parameters and anti-hypoxia activities of the experimental mice were studied. The results showed that LEP-1 had strong ability to increase the red blood cell (RBC) amount and hemoglobin (HGB) concentrations, and could also prolong the survival times of mice in normobarie hypoxia and sodium nitrite tests. These suggest LEP-1 may be considered as a potential candidate for developing novel anti-hypoxia agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   A water-soluble exopolysaccharide, designated as LEP-2a, was isolated from  Lachnum  YM262 and purified by DEAE-Cellulose 52 and Sepharose CL-6B chromatographic columns. LEP-2a was a homogeneous polysaccharide, with a molecular weight of 1.52\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 5  Da. It was composed of mannose and galactose in a molar ratio of 20.6:1.0. Its structural features were investigated and elucidated by methylation analysis, periodate oxidation and Smith degradation, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. Based on obtained data, the backbone of LEP-2a consisted of 1,2-linked-\u03b1- d -mannose, 1,3-linked-\u03b1- d -mannose, 1,2,6-linked-\u03b1- d -mannose and 1,3-linked-\u03b2- d -galactose and the side chains were attached to the backbone at O-6 position of 1,2,6-linked-\u03b1- d -mannose.  In vitro  antioxidant activity assay proved that LEP-2a possessed significant scavenging activities on superoxide, hydroxyl and DPPH radical. Furthermore, LEP-2a had strong  in vitro  moisture-absorption and -retention capacities as compared to chitosan and glycerol. These results suggested that LEP-2a might have a good potential to be applied as a multifunctional cosmetic additive in cosmetics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   LEP-2a, previously obtained from  Lachnum  YM130 exopolysaccharide, was acetylated and benzoylated successfully, which were confirmed by FT-IR and  13 C NMR analyses. The derivatives were designated as ALEP-2a and BLEP-2a, respectively, and their respective degree of substitution were 0.220 and 0.574. Our study showed that LEP-2a and its derivatives treatments significantly increased the activities of SOD, GPx, CAT and decreased the level of MDA in heart of the diabetic mice, meanwhile, the levels of AGEs, hs-CRP, sICAM-1, NO and ET-1 in serum were markedly inverted. In addition, histopathological observation also showed that polysaccharide treatement alleviated myocardial structure disorder and confluent necrosis of cardiac muscle fibers in the diabetic mice, especially the 200\u00a0mg/kg dose ALEP-2a-treated and BLEP-2a-treated. The above results suggest that ALEP-2a and BLEP-2a can preferably maintain the levels of antioxidant enzymes and improve cardiovascular function in the diabetic mice. In conclusion, LEP-2a and its derivatives possess potent cardioprotective effect, supporting them as promising cardioprotective agents in diabetes mellitus.",

        "abstract": "An extracellular polysaccharide of Lachnum sp. (LEP) was purified by DEAE-cellulose 52 column chromatography and Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. LEP-2a was identified to be a homogeneous component with an average molecular weight of 3.22\u00d710(4)Da. The structure of LEP-2a was characterized by chemical and spectroscopic methods, including methylation analysis, periodate oxidation-smith degradation, infrared spectroscopy and NMR analysis. Results indicated that LEP-2a was a (1\u21923)-,(1\u21926)-\u03b2-D-Glcp, whose branch chain was consist of two D-glucopyranosyl residues linked by \u03b2-1,3-glycosidic linkage, which was linked at C6 of the backbone chain by \u03b2-1,6-glycosidic linkage. To study the protective effects of LEP-2a on the ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in mice, LEP-2a (100, 200 and 400mg/Kg/d) was given to mice by gavage for 2 weeks. Results showed that LEP-2a significantly decreased the ulcer bleeding areas, pepsin activity, gastric juice volume, gastric juice total acidity and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in serum. Meanwhile, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased significantly. The above findings suggested that LEP-2a had a significant preventive effect against the ethanol-induced gastric ulcer.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective The aim of this study is to detect the expression of melanoma antigen-C2 (MAGE-C2) in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and adjacent non-cancerousous tissues and analyze its clinical significance. Methods The expression level of MAGE-C2 mRNA and MAGE-C2 protein were measured in 87 cases of lung adenocarcinoma tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were detected by Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot. Results Over-expression of the MAGE-C2 mRNA and MAGE-C2 protein were observed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues (53/87, 60.9%), but nor in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The expressions of MAGE-C2 mRNA and MAGE-C2 protein were closely associated with clinical stage, metastasis and differentiation (P 0.05). The expression of MAGE-C2 had an adverse effect on overall survival rate (Pu003c0.05). Conclusion Over-expression of the MAGE-C2 mRNA and protein is existed in lung adenocarcinoma. The high expression of MAGE-C2 may be closely related to the occurrence and development in lung adenocarcinoma. MAGE-C2 may predict a poor prognosis and could be as a novel lung adenocarcinoma molecule marker.  DOI: 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2016.02.09",

        "abstract": "BackgroundTraditional diagnostic technology with tumor biomarkers is inefficient, expensive and requires a large number of serum samples. The purpose of this study was to construct human lung cancer protein chips with new lung cancer biomarkers screened by the T7-phage display library, and improve the early diagnosis rate of lung cancer.MethodsA T7-phage cDNA display library was constructed of fresh samples from 30 lung cancer patients. With biopanning and high-throughput screening, we gained the immunogenic phage clones from the cDNA library. The insert of selected phage was blasted at GeneBank for alignment to find the exact or the most similar known genes. Protein chips were then constructed and used to assay their expression level in lung cancer serum from 217 cases of lung cancer groups:80 cases of benign lung disease and 220 healthy controls.ResultsAfter four rounds of Biopanning and two rounds of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 12 phage monoclonal samples were selected from 2880 phage monoclonal samples. After blasting at GeneBank, six similar genes were used to construct diagnostic protein chips. The protein chips were then used to assay expression level in lung cancer serum. The expression level of six genes in lung cancer groups was significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P u003c 0.05).ConclusionsIn this study, we successfully constructed diagnostic protein chips with biomarkers selected from the lung cancer T7-phage cDNA library, which can be used for the early screening of lung cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "In addition to birth and death, migration is also an important factor that determines the level of population aging in different regions, especially under the current context of low fertility and low mortality in China. Drawing upon data from the fifth and sixth national population census of 287 prefecture-level cities in China, this study explored the spatial patterns of population aging and its trends from 2000 to 2010 in China. We further examined how the large-scale internal migration was related to the spatial differences and the changes of aging by using multivariate quantitative models. Findings showed that the percentage of elder cities (i.e. proportion of individuals aged 65 and above to total population is higher than 7%) increased from 50% to 90% in the total 287 cities within the decade. We also found that regional imbalances of population aging have changed since 2000 in China. The gap of aging level between East zone and the other three zones (i.e. West, Central, and North-east) has considerably narrowed down. In 2000, Eastern region had the greatest number (65) of and the largest proportion (74.7%) of elder cities among all four regions. By 2010, the proportion (87.4%) of elder cities in the eastern region was slightly lower than Central (91.4%), Western (88.2%) and North-east sectors (91.2%). Results from multivariate quantitative models showed that the regional differences of population aging appear to be affected much more by the large-scale internal migration with clear age selectivity and orientation preference than by the impact of fertility and mortality. Population aging is expected to continue in China, which will in turn exacerbate regional imbalances. Policies and implications are discussed to face the challenges that the divergent aging population may present in China.",

        "abstract": "An ultra-scalable fully-implicit solver is developed for stiff time-dependent problems arising from the hyperbolic conservation laws in nonhydrostatic atmospheric dynamics. In the solver, we propose a highly efficient hybrid domain-decomposed multigrid preconditioner that can greatly accelerate the convergence rate at the extreme scale. For solving the overlapped subdomain problems, a geometry-based pipelined incomplete LU factorization method is designed to further exploit the on-chip fine-grained concurrency. We perform systematic optimizations on different hardware levels to achieve best utilization of the heterogeneous computing units and substantial reduction of data movement cost. The fully-implicit solver successfully scales to the entire system of the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer with over 10.5M heterogeneous cores, sustaining an aggregate performance of 7.95 PFLOPS in double-precision, and enables fast and accurate atmospheric simulations at the 488-m horizontal resolution (over 770 billion unknowns) with 0.07 simulated-years-per-day. This is, to our knowledge, the largest fully-implicit simulation to date.",

        "abstract": "Stencil computation arises from a broad set of scientific and engineering applications and often plays a critical role in the performance of extreme-scale simulations. Due to the memory bound nature, it is a challenging task to opti- mize stencil computation kernels on modern supercomputers with relatively high computing throughput whilst relatively low data-moving capability. This work serves as a demon- stration on the details of the algorithms, implementations and optimizations of a real-world stencil computation in 3D nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling on the newly announced Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. At the algorithm level, we present a computation-communication overlapping technique to reduce the inter-process communication overhead, a locality- aware blocking method to fully exploit on-chip parallelism with enhanced data locality, and a collaborative data accessing scheme for sharing data among different threads. In addition, a variety of effective hardware specific implementation and optimization strategies on both the process- and thread-level, from the fine-grained data management to the data layout transformation, are developed to further improve the per- formance. Our experiments demonstrate that a single-process many-core speedup of as high as 170x can be achieved by using the proposed algorithm and optimization strategies. The code scales well to millions of cores in terms of strong scalability. And for the weak-scaling tests, the code can scale in a nearly ideal way to the full system scale of more than 10 million cores, sustaining 25.96 PFLOPS in double precision, which is 20% of the peak performance.",

        "abstract": "The sparse triangular solver (SpTRSV) is one of the most essential kernels in many scientific and engineering applications. Efficiently parallelizing the SpTRSV on modern many-core architectures is considerably difficult due to inherent dependency of computation and discontinuous memory accesses. Achieving high performance of SpTRSV is even more challenging for SW26010, the new-generation customized heterogeneous many-core processor equipped in the top-rank Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Owing to regular sparse pattern, structured-grid triangular problems show much different computing characteristics with general ones as well as new opportunities to algorithm design on many-core architectures, which ever lacks attention. In this work, we focus on how to design and implement fast SpTRSV for structured-grid problems on SW26010. A generalized algorithm framework of parallel SpTRSV is proposed for best utilization of the features and flexibilities of SW26010 many-core architecture according to the fine-grained Producer-Consumer model. Moreover, a novel parallel structured-grid SpTRSV is presented by using direct data transfers across registers of the computing elements of SW26010. Experiments on four typical structured-grid triangular problems with different problem sizes demonstrate that our SpTRSV can achieve an average momory bandwidth utilization of 79.7% according to the stream benchmark, which leads to a speedup of 17.7 over serial version on SW26010. Furthermore, experiments with real world sparse linear problems show that our proposed SpTRSV can achieve superior preconditioning performance over the Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 CPU and Intel Xeon Phi 7210 KNL over DDR4 memory.",

        "abstract": "Programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression has been revealed to be upregulated on T cells and contributes to T cell exhaustion in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this study, we investigated the dynamic expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), the ligand of PD-1, on circulating CD14 monocytes and CD19 B cells of HBV-infected patients at the stages of chronic HBV (CHB) infection, liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. The results showed that compared with healthy controls, the levels of PD-L1 expression on CD14 and CD19 populations were both upregulated in CHB, LC, and HCC groups. Although there was no significant difference of PD-L1 expression on CD14 population among three disease groups, further analysis demonstrated that the frequency of CD14PD-L1 population was negatively correlated with HBV DNA load, the levels of alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), respectively, at CHB stage, while it did not present significant correlation with such parameters at LC stage and was only positively correlated with HBV DNA load at HCC stage. Similarly, the levels of PD-L1 expression on CD19 population also did not present much difference among three disease groups. Intriguingly, the frequencies of CD19PD-L1 population at CHB and LCC stages were both positively correlated with the levels of ALT and AST, but they were not significantly correlated with HBV DNA load. Thereby, the current study elucidated the dynamics of PD-L1 expression on monocytes and B cells, along with the dynamic regulation of PD-1 on T cells, which had a close relationship during the progression of HBV infection. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that in the course of HBV infection development, PD-L1 expression on CD14 monocytes and CD19 B cells varied and significantly correlated with clinical parameters, which could be utilized as a potential clinical indicator.",

In order to assess the sensitivity and reliability of potential miRNAs as diagnostic markers for liver disease related to viral infection, alcohol abuse, or chemical exposure, we collected serum samples from 326 participants and evaluated the single and combination diagnostic values of three serum miRNAs (miR-122, miR-125b, miR-192) compared with a conventional marker ALT. We found that serum miR-122 is significantly elevated in patients with active HBV. MiR-125b increased in HCV positive patients, whereas miR-192 and miR-122 were associated with chemical-induced liver injury. None of the aforementioned miRNAs were shown to increase significantly in alcohol-related liver injuries. Furthermore, we analyzed different combinations and found that a set of miR-122 and miR-125b enhanced the sensitivity of detecting liver injury. Among the 58 ALI/ALF patients, miR-122 responded more rapidly than ALT in successful treatments. Patients with spontaneous recovery from ALI/ALF showed significantly higher serum levels of miR-122 and miR-125b compared to non-recovered patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of miR-122 and miR-125b may serve as efficient biomarkers for liver injury and may be of a prognostic value in predicting ALI/ALF outcome.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence demonstrates that CD8CD28 regulatory T cells increase in chronic viral infection as well as tumorigenesis. However, it is still not clear about their characteristics in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In addition, it is not understood whether this regulatory immune subset is distinct from CD4CD25 regulatory T cells in the aspect of impact on or relationship to the progression of HBV infection. Hence, we investigated their dynamics and compared their correlations with clinical parameters in the chronic and advanced phases of HBV infection. The data showed that compared with healthy controls, the frequencies of CD28CD8 and CD4CD25 T cells increased in both chronic and advanced phases, while there is no significant difference between the two case groups. Interestingly, we found that in chronic phase, the frequency of CD8CD28 subset was negatively correlated with the levels of alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), respectively, and did not present association with HBV DNA load, whereas that of CD4CD25 T cells was positively correlated with HBV DNA load and the levels of ALT and AST, respectively. Amazingly, in advanced phase, the frequency of CD4CD25 T cells was negatively correlated with HBV DNA load and the levels of ALT, respectively, while there is no significant correlation between the frequency of CD8CD28 subset and those clinical parameters. Thereby, our findings demonstrated that CD28CD8 and CD4CD25 regulatory T cells might exert distinct effect on modulating antiviral immune responses and mitigate immunomediated liver damage in different phases of HBV infection, which represent potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for HBV-infected patients based on further exploration of detailed mechanism.",

The TLT-2 expression levels in the acute hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis B groups were significantly higher than that in the healthy control group and were positively correlated with ALT and AST. The CD8+TLT-2+T cells exhibited stronger immune function and greater cell proliferation ability and secreted higher levels of cytokines than the CD8+TLT-2\u2212T cells. An analysis of the proteome differences between the TLT-2+CD8+T and TLT-2\u2212CD8+T cells revealed that TLT-2 affected CD8+T cell activation by regulating Granzyme B expression and by further action on the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. This study first elucidated the mechanism by which TLT-2 influences the activation of CD8+T cells, improved the understanding of the TLT-2 signalling pathway and clarified the role of the TLT-2+CD8+T cell subset in hepatitis B virus infection. The study proposed a novel subset of CD8+T cells that could be useful for understanding the immune function of patients with hepatitis B and further elucidating the pathogenesis of hepatitis B by analysing changes in this subpopulation with the goal of providing a new target for the treatment of hepatitis B.",

        "abstract": "B7-H3, one of the costimulatory members participating in checkpoint pathway, has been shown to be upregulated after hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To further explore the clinical significance of dynamic B7-H3 expression during the progression of HBV infection, we systematically investigated the expression pattern of B7-H3 and the correlation of B7-H3 expression with the ratio of T lymphocyte subsets and clinical parameters at different stages in the course of the disease. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data showed that soluble form of B7-H3 (sB7-H3) was positively correlated with the frequency of T cells in acute hepatitis B (AHB), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and hepatocellular carcinoma patients with HBV infection (HBV-HCC). Membrane form of B7-H3 (mB7-H3) expressed on T cells and monocytes was positively correlated with the frequency of T cells in CHB. SB7-H3 had relationship with mB7-H3 expressed on T cells and monocytes at different stages during HBV infection, except for HBV-HCC. MB7-H3 expressed on T cells was positively correlated with that on monocytes in AHB, CHB, HBV-liver cirrhosis, and HBV-HCC. The B7-H3 expression was positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in CHB and sB7-H3 level was higher in late tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage in HCC. Higher mB7-H3 expression was associated with greater tumor size, later TNM stage, and worse prognosis in HBV-HCC indicated by immunohistochemistry. Taken together, these results suggested that B7-H3 might contribute to the progression of HBV infection by triggering inhibitory signals in effector T cells and it was closely associated with the progression and poor prognosis during HBV infection. B7-H3 could be utilized as a potential clinical indicator and a potential target for therapeutic strategies against HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen for tuberculosis treatment.We performed a meta-analysis of 9 eligible studies regarding the effect of moxifloxacin plus the recommended regimen compared to recommended regimen alone for the treatment of tuberculosis.For the efficacy analysis, the overall odds ratios (OR) for the sputum culture conversion was 1.895 [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.355-2.651, p=0.000], indicating when combining moxifloxacin with the recommended regimen, the rate of sputum culture conversion was elevated compared with the recommended regimen alone. The overall OR for the recurrence was 0.516 (95% CI: 0.342-0.920, p=0.022), suggesting the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen reduced the relapse of tuberculosis after treatment. For the safety analysis, the overall OR was estimated to be 1.001 (95% CI: 0.855-1.172, p=0.989), demonstrating that adding moxifloxacin to the recommended regimen would not cause more adverse events for the tuberculosis treatment.Our meta-analysis suggests that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen for the non-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment improves the clinical outcome by elevating the culture conversion rate and reducing the recurrence rate.",

Stent migration occurred in one case, and stent reimplantation was performed. One case suffered from hematoma after transposition of the superior mesenteric artery, and reoperation was performed. Follow-up was made from 6 months to 6 years after the operation. Abnormalities were not found in the urine test of 18 patients and their symptoms disappeared. Two cases still had microscopic hematuria after exercise. All surgical operations are effective for nutcracker syndrome except excessive invasiveness. Stent may be one of the mainstream therapies because of its minimal invasiveness.",

In particular, we prove that both $H^{bullet}_{operatorname{CE}}(A,mathcal{X}_{operatorname{poly}}{bullet})$ and $H^{bullet}_{operatorname{CE}}(A,mathcal{D}_{operatorname{poly}}{bullet})$ are Gerstenhaber algebras. Our approach is based on the construction of a homological vector field $Q$ on the graded manifold $L[1]oplus L/A$ and of a dg foliation (which we call Fedosov dg Lie algebroid) on the resulting dg manifold $(L[1]oplus L/A,Q)$. We also prove an Emmrich--Weinstein theorem for Lie pairs: the cohomological vector field $Q$ constructed on $L[1]oplus L/A$ by the Fedosov iteration method ensues from the Poincaru0027e--Birkhoff--Witt map established in arXiv:1408.2903.",

In this paper, we prove that, beyond the sole complex manifolds, the Kontsevich--Duflo theorem holds in a very wide range of geometric contexts admitting a description in terms of Lie algebroids, which include foliations and manifolds endowed with a Lie group action. More precisely, we prove a Kontsevich--Duflo theorem for Lie pairs. Every Lie pair $(L,A)$, i.e. the data of a Lie subalgebroid $A$ of a Lie algebroid $L$, gives rise to two Gerstenhaber algebras $H^{bullet}_{operatorname{CE}}(A,mathcal{X}_{operatorname{poly}}^{bullet})$ and $H^{bullet}_{operatorname{CE}}(A,mathcal{D}_{operatorname{poly}}^{bullet})$ playing a role similar to the spaces of polyvector fields and of polydifferential operators.

As main result, we prove that, given a Lie pair $(L,A)$, the space $Omega^{bullet}_A(Lambda^bullet(L/A))$ admits a $(-1)$-shifted derived Poisson algebra structure with the wedge product as associative multiplication and the Chevalley--Eilenberg differential $d_A^{operatorname{Bott}}:Omega^{bullet}_A(Lambda^bullet(L/A))toOmega^{bullet +1}_A(Lambda^bullet(L/A))$ as first $L_infty$ bracket. This $(-1)$-shifted derived Poisson algebra structure on $Omega^{bullet}_A(Lambda^bullet(L/A))$ is unique up to an isomorphism having the identity map as first Taylor coefficient. The $A$-module structure on $Lambda^{bullet}(L/A)$ at hand is the natural extension of the Bott $A$-connection on $L/A$.

The spaces $cx{T}$ and $cx{D}$ associated with a Lie pair $(L,A)$ each carry an $L_infty$ algebra structure canonical up to $L_infty$ isomorphism. These two spaces serve as replacements for the spaces of polyvector fields and polydifferential operators, respectively. Their corresponding cohomology groups $cy{T}$ and $cy{D}$ admit canonical Gerstenhaber algebra structures. We establish the following formality theorem for Lie pairs: there exists an $L_infty$ quasi isomorphism from $cx{T}$ to $cx{D}$ whose first Taylor coefficient is equal to $operatorname{hkr}circtd$. Here $td$ acts on $cx{T}$ by contraction. Furthermore, we prove a Kontsevich--Duflo type theorem for Lie pairs: the Hochschild--Kostant--Rosenberg map twisted by the square root of the Todd class of the Lie pair $(L,A)$ is an isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras from $cy{T}$ to $cy{D}$.

        "abstract": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in many important biological pathways. They suppress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by directing the RNA-induced silencing complex to their sequence-specific mRNA target(s). In plants, this typically results in mRNA cleavage and subsequent degradation of the mRNA. The resulting mRNA fragments, or degradome, provide evidence for these interactions, and thus degradome analysis has become an important tool for sRNA target prediction. Even so, with the continuing advances in sequencing technologies, not only are larger and more complex genomes being sequenced, but also degradome and associated datasets are growing both in number and read count. As a result, existing degradome analysis tools are unable to process the volume of data being produced without imposing huge resource and time requirements. Moreover, these tools use stringent, non-configurable targeting rules, which reduces their flexibility. Here, we present a new and user configurable software tool for degradome analysis, which employs a novel search algorithm and sequence encoding technique to reduce the search space during analysis. The tool significantly reduces the time and resources required to perform degradome analysis, in some cases providing more than two orders of magnitude speed-up over current methods.",

The ssRNA contains a single open reading frame (ORF) of 2,373 nucleotides in length and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) closely related to ourmiaviruses (plant viruses) and ourmia-like mycoviruses. Accordingly, we name this virus Magnaporthe oryzae ourmia-like virus 1 (MOLV1). Although phylogenetic analysis suggests that MOLV1 is closely related to ourmia and ourmia-like viruses, it has some features never reported before within the Ourmiavirus genus. 3' RLM-RACE (RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and extension poly(A) tests (ePAT) suggest that the MOLV1 genome contains a poly(A) tail whereas the three cytosine and the three guanine residues present in 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of ourmia viruses are not observed in the MOLV1 sequence. The discovery of this novel viral genome supports the hypothesis that plant pathogenic fungi may have acquired this type of viruses from their host plants.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality, whose incidence is associated with dietary and lifestyle factors, particularly inversely so with the consumption of cruciferous vegetables. These vegetables contain glucosinolates, from the breakdown of which are derived isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is well-characterised for wide-ranging tumour-suppressive and chemoprotective activities in vitro, yet deeper elucidation of its biological interactions would aid in better realising its potential in chemoprevention and/or chemotherapy. There is evidence to suggest that sulforaphane modulates microRNA expression in the colon, thus implying the potential for microRNA modulation to play a role in the anti-cancer effects of sulforaphane. Therefore, the effects of sulforaphane on microRNA expression profiles in the colonic adenocarcinoma Caco-2 and non-cancerous colonic CCD-841 cell lines were investigated by small RNA cloning and deep sequencing, followed by Northern Blot validation experiments. Sulforaphane upregulated let-7f-5p and let-7g-5p expression at 24 h in Caco-2 cells, but not in CCD-841. Such treatment also downregulated miR-29b-3p in Caco-2. Dual luciferase assays with a let-7f-5p mimic and inhibitor confirmed the binding of the miRNA to predicted binding sites in the mRNA transcript 39-UTRs of cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A), high-mobility group AT-hook-2 (HMGA2) and MYC. Therefore, we hypothesize that let-7f-5p translationally represses CDC25A, HMGA2 and MYC, thereby playing a role in the tumour-suppressive effects of sulforaphane. The apparent selectivity of let-7f-5p induction towards tumour cells would be therapeutically desirable if applicable in vivo. MiR-29b-3p is predicted to target a number of tumour-suppressing genes, further investigation of which could be informative regarding the potential of sulforaphane to suppress tumour progression.",

        "abstract": "Single-nucleotide resolution, high throughput and excellent precision make small RNA sequencing ideally suited for addressing a wide array of microRNA (miRNA) research questions. It is however known that adapter ligation introduces bias distorting the relation between sample expression levels and sequencing read counts. To investigate how this issue may affect studies aiming to identify miRNA biomarkers, we utilized the recently published High Definition library preparation protocol to generate miRNA profiles of 35 colorectal cancer cell lines, 55 primary cancer biopsies and 5 adjacent normal mucosa samples. The protocol minimizes ligation bias by means of randomized adapter pools. Comparing the resulting data against publicly available colorectal cancer miRNA datasets, we demonstrate that the High Definition protocol moderates read count distributions, increases accuracy and improves sensitivity while maintaining high reproducibility. Moreover, by taking advantage of the more quantitative read counts, the cancer cell line panel and the normal mucosa samples, we identify a set of miRNAs that are highly expressed in epithelial cancerous cells, deregulated in colorectal cancer as compared to normal mucosa and differentially expressed between established molecular subgroups. As such, these miRNAs present strong candidates for functional validation and biomarker testing. In conclusion, we here present High Definition miRNA sequencing data for a large panel of clinically relevant colorectal cancer samples highlighting the potential of improved small RNA library preparation methods.

The ultimate goal of vitiligo treatment is to replenish the lost melanocytes by immigration from hair follicle and to restore the normal function of melanogenesis by residual melanocytes. There are two types of topical calcineurin inhibitors called tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and are recommended as the first-line treatments in vitiligo. Although pimecrolimus is efficacious for the repigmentation of vitiligo, its intrinsic mechanisms have never been investigated in vitro. This research aimed to study the ability of pimecrolimus on stimulating melanogenesis, melanocyte migration and MITF (microphthalmia associated transcription factor) protein expression. Results showed that pimecrolimus at the dosages of 1, 10, 10 nM were neither mitogenic nor cytotoxic to melanocytes. The addition of pimecrolimus at 10, 10 and 10 nM significantly increased intracellular tyrosinase activity, which was consistent with the elevated content of melanin content at the same concentrations. The peak effect was seen at 72 h in response to 10 nM pimecrolimus. Results of the wound scratch assay and Transwell assays indicate that pimecrolimus is effective in facilitating melanocyte migration on a collagen IV-coated surface. In addition, MITF protein yield reached the highest by pimecrolimus at 10 nM. In brief, pimecrolimus enhances melanin synthesis as well as promotes migration of melanocytes directly, possibly via their effects on MITF protein expression.",

At present, radio-protective effect of troxerutin has been confirmed, but the mechanism of this radioprotection has not been elucidated. Here, this study showed that troxerutin protected thymus tissue of irradiated mice, and its radio-protective effect on thymocytes was significant in the range of 0.625-10\u03bcg/ml. Troxerutin significantly inhibited apoptosis of irradiated thymocytes at the concentration of 10\u03bcg/ml. Computer-aided drug design was used to investigate potential candidate targets for troxerutin, and an excellent correlation was identified between troxerutin and AKT (Pharm mapper and KEGG signal pathway). Troxerutin inhibited the activation of PTEN to stimulate AKT, which in turn prevented the activation of JNK to protect cells. Our results showed that troxerutin enhanced radioprotection at least partially by activating AKT to inhibit the activation of JNK.",

        "abstract": "The present study evaluated the protective effect of the natural compound flavonoids of Rosa roxburghii Tratt (FRT) against \u03b3-radiation-induced apoptosis and inflammation in mouse thymus cells in vivo and in vitro. Thymus cells and mice were exposed to Co \u03b3-ray at a dose of 6\u00a0Gy. The radiation treatment induced significant cell apoptosis and inflammation. Radiation increased the expressions of cleaved caspase 3/8-10, AIF, and PARP-1, and FRT could mitigate their activation and inhibit subsequent apoptosis in the thymus both in vitro or in vivo. Irradiation increased the mRNA expression of ICAM-1/VCAM-1, IL-1\u03b1/IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB. Our results also indicated that FRT alleviated gene expression of some inflammatory factors such as ICAM-1/VCAM-1, TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB, but not IL-1\u03b1/IL-6. Irradiation increased the protein expression levels of ICAM-1/VCAM-1, IL-1\u03b1/IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u039ab, and our results also indicated that FRT alleviated protein level expression of certain inflammatory factors such as ICAM-1, IL-1\u03b1/IL-6, TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB, but not VCAM-1. Our results suggested that FRT enhanced radioprotection at least partially by regulating caspase 3/8-10, AIF, and PARP-1 to reduce apoptosis and by regulating ICAM-1, IL-1\u03b1/IL-6, TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB to reduce inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Ionizing radiation has the potential to cause extensive damage to living organisms. It can directly act on DNA, proteins and lipids, resulting in ionizing excitation and chemical bond cleavage, which can lead to molecular and cellular damage. Ionizing radiation can hydrolyze water molecules in the body, resulting in increased numbers of free radicals with strong oxidation ability. This process indirectly leads to tissue degeneration and necrosis, which can possibly result in cancer. In this paper, the intervention mechanism of flavonoids on ionizing radiation was analyzed. It has been revealed that the intervention mechanism associated with flavonoids may offer protective properties for DNA, prevent scavenging free radicals, and protect against auto-immune damage. In addition, this invention mechanism can protect the hematopoietic system and reduce inflammation   Keywords:  Ionizing radiation, Flavonoids, Radioprotective mechanisms, Molecular and cellular damage, DNA, Hematopoietic system, Inflammation",

        "abstract": "Purpose : To perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of catechin and quercetin in flavonoids extracted from Rosa roxburghii Tratt.  Methods : Total flavonoids were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV) at 500 nm. The optimal gradient program started with 15 % methanol and was kept within a period of 0 \u2013 20 min, while 25 % methanol was kept within 20 \u2013 33 min. Subsequently, the concentration of methanol was reduced to 15 % and was held for 10 min until the next injection. Mass spectrometry spray voltage was 4,000 V, ionization temperature 350 \u00b0C, atomizer pressure 35 psi, nitrogen flow rate 8 L/min, and mass scan range 200 \u2013 800 m/z. The detection wavelength used for catechin and quercetin was 270 and 368 nm, respectively.  Results : Based on the UV results, Rosa roxburghii Tratt content was 73.85 %, which is in agreement with the national standard. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results indicate that Rosa roxburghii Tratt flavonoids contained quercetin, 34.26 %, with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.88 % and catechin content of 2.97 % with RSD of 1.49 %.  Conclusion : The proposed measurement method for determining the content of flavonoids in Rosa roxburghii Tratt has the advantage of simplicity, feasibility, good repeatability, and rapid and accurate analysis.

        "abstract": "The objective of our study was to assess the radioprotective effect of flavonoids extracted from Rosa roxburghii Tratt (FRT) and investigate the role of Bcl-2(Ca(2+))/Caspase-3/PARP-1 pathway in radiation-induced apoptosis. Cells and mice were exposed to (60)Co \u03b3-rays at a dose of 6\u00a0Gy. The radiation treatment induced significant effects on tissue pathological changes, apoptosis, Ca(2+), ROS, DNA damage, and expression levels of Bcl-2, Caspase-3 (C-Caspase-3), and PARP-1. The results showed that FRT acted as an antioxidant, reduced DNA damage, corrected the pathological changes of the tissue induced by radiation, promoted the formation of spleen nodules, resisted sperm aberration, and protected the thymus. FRT significantly reduced cell apoptosis compared with the irradiation group. The expression of Ca(2+) and C-Caspase-3 was decreased after FRT treatment compared with the radiation-treated group. At the same time, expression of prototype PARP-1 and Bcl-2 increased, leading to a decrease in the percentage of apoptosis cells in FRT treatment groups. We conclude that FRT acts as a radioprotector. Apoptosis signals were activated via the Bcl-2(Ca(2+))/Caspase-3/PARP-1 pathway in irradiated cells and FRT inhibited this pathway of apoptosis by down-regulation of C-Caspase-3 and Ca(2+) and up-regulation of prototype PARP-1 and Bcl-2.

        "abstract": "Background:  Because of advancements in care, there has been a decline in mortality from congenital heart defects (CHDs) over the past several decades. However, there are no current empirical data documenting the number of people living with CHDs in the United States. Our aim was to estimate the CHD prevalence across all age groups in the United States in the year 2010.  Methods:  The age-, sex-, and severity-specific observed prevalence of CHDs in Quebec, Canada, in the year 2010 was assumed to equal the CHD prevalence in the non-Hispanic white population in the United States in 2010. A race-ethnicity adjustment factor, reflecting differential survival between racial-ethnic groups through 5 years of age for individuals with a CHD and that in the general US population, was applied to the estimated non-Hispanic white rates to derive CHD prevalence estimates among US non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. Confidence intervals for the estimated CHD prevalence rates and case counts were derived from a combination of Taylor series approximations and Monte Carlo simulation.  Results:  We estimated that \u22482.4 million people (1.4 million adults, 1 million children) were living with CHDs in the United States in 2010. Nearly 300\u2009000 of these individuals had severe CHDs.  Conclusions:  Our estimates highlight the need for 2 important efforts: planning for health services delivery to meet the needs of the growing population of adults with CHD and the development of surveillance data across the life span to provide empirical estimates of the prevalence of CHD across all age groups in the United States.",

        "abstract": "The aerial parts of land plants are covered with cuticular waxes that limit non-stomatal water loss and gaseous exchange, and protect plants from ultraviolet radiation and pathogen attack. This is the first report on the characterization and genetic mapping of a novel dominant glossy mutant (BnaA.GL) in Brassica napus.Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cuticle ultrastructure of GL mutant leaf and stem were altered dramatically compared with that of wide type (WT). Scanning electron microscopy corroborated the reduction of wax on the leaf and stem surface. A cuticular wax analysis of the GL mutant leaves further confirmed the drastic decrease in the total wax content, and a wax compositional analysis revealed an increase in aldehydes but a severe decrease in alkanes, ketones and secondary alcohols. These results suggested a likely blockage of the decarbonylation step in the wax biosynthesis pathway. Genetic mapping narrowed the location of the BnaA.GL gene to the end of A9 chromosome. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip assay in combination with bulk segregant analysis (BSA) also located SNPs in the same region. Two SNPs, two single sequence repeat (SSR) markers and one IP marker were located on the flanking region of the BnaA.GL gene at a distance of 0.6 cM. A gene homologous to ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) was located in the mapped region. A cDNA microarray chip assay revealed coordinated down regulation of genes encoding enzymes of the cuticular wax biosynthetic pathway in the glossy mutant, with BnCER1 being one of the most severely suppressed genes.Our results indicated that surface wax biosynthesis is broadly affected in the glossy mutant due to the suppression of the BnCER1 and other wax-related genes. These findings offer novel clues for elucidating the molecular basis of the glossy phenotype.",

To investigate genetic variants leading to changes in root system architecture, 405 oilseed rape cultivars were genotyped with a 60K Brassica Infinium SNP array in low and high P environments. A total of 285 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with root system architecture traits at varying phosphorus levels. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms corroborate a previous linkage analysis of root system architecture quantitative trait loci in the BnaTNDH population. One peak single-nucleotide polymorphism region on A3 was associated with all root system architecture traits and co-localized with a quantitative trait locus for primary root length at low phosphorus. Two more single-nucleotide polymorphism peaks on A5 for root dry weight at low phosphorus were detected in both growth systems and co-localized with a quantitative trait locus for the same trait. The candidate genes identified on A3 form a haplotype 'BnA3Hap', that will be important for understanding the phosphorus/root system interaction and for the incorporation into Brassica napus breeding programs.",

We conducted a high throughput study on concomitant transcriptome and proteome dynamics in a time course to assess S. sanguinis behaviour under a sub-inhibitory concentration of ampicillin. Temporal changes at the transcriptome and proteome level were monitored to cover essential genes and proteins over a physiological map of intricate pathways. Our findings revealed that translation was the functional category in S. sanguinis that was most enriched in essential proteins. Moreover, essential proteins in this category demonstrated the greatest conservation across 2774 bacterial proteomes, in comparison to other essential functional categories like cell wall biosynthesis and energy production. In comparison to non-essential proteins, essential proteins were less likely to contain 'degradation-prone' amino acids at their N-terminal position, suggesting a longer half-life. Despite the ampicillin-induced stress, the transcriptional up-regulation of amino acid-tRNA synthetases and proteomic elevation of amino acid biosynthesis enzymes favoured the enriched components of essential proteins revealing 'proteomic signatures' that can be used to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap of S. sanguinis under ampicillin stress. Furthermore, we identified a significant correlation between the levels of mRNA and protein for essential genes and detected essential protein-enriched pathways differentially regulated through a persistent stress response pattern at late time points. We propose that the current findings will help characterize a bacterial model to study the dynamics of essential genes and proteins under clinically relevant stress conditions.",

Here, we focus on the mechanism of biofilm formation in S. sanguinis and the interaction of S. sanguinis with caries- and periodontitis-associated pathogens.

        "abstract": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are among the most common methods to improve indoor air quality. However, after long-term operation, the HVAC filter can result in a proliferation of bacteria, which may release into the filtered air subsequently. This issue can be addressed by designing antibacterial filters. In this study, we report an iron oxide nanowires-based filter fabricated from commercially available iron mesh through a thermal treatment. At optimal conditions, the filter demonstrated a log inactivation efficiency of > 7 within 10 seconds towards  (Gram-positive), a common bacterial species of indoor bioaerosol. 52 % of bioaerosol cells can be captured by a single filter, which can be further improved to 98.7 % by connecting five filters in-tandem. The capture and inactivation capacity of the reported filter did not degrade over long-term use. The inactivation of bacteria is attributed to the synergic effects of the hydroxyl radicals, electroporation, and Joule heating, which disrupted the cell wall and nucleoid of , as verified by the model simulations, fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The relative humidity plays an important role in the inactivation process. The filter also exhibited a satisfactory inactivation efficiency towards  (Gram-negative). The robust synthesis, low cost, and satisfactory inactivation performance towards both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria make the filter demonstrated here suitable to be assembled into HVAC filters as an antibacterial layer for efficient control of indoor bioaerosols.",

Fourteen conserved residues except L174 and G211 were mutated to analyze the effect of site-directed mutagenesis. The expression of UbiA in twelve mutants was decreased in both mRNA and protein levels, which resulted in the decrease of UQ concentration. Based on MenA expression level, 12 mutants were divided into two groups. Second group such as N72A, D76A, K81A, L139A, and D198A enhanced the expression of MenA, which increased MK production by 127.1%, 87.9%, 96.2%, 109.7% and 130.0% in wt-EmUbiA, respectively.

        "abstract": "Mixed species biofilms are shaped and influenced by interactions between species. In the oral cavity, dysbiosis of the microbiome leads to diseases such as periodontitis. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen of periodontitis. In this study, we showed that polymicrobial biofilm formation promoted the tolerance of Porphyromonas gingivalis to oxidative stress under micro-aerobic conditions. The presence of Streptococcus sanguinis, an oral commensal bacterium, inhibited the survival of P. gingivalis in dual-species biofilms via the secretion of hydrogen peroxide (HO). Interestingly, this repression could be attenuated by the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in tri-species biofilms. It was also shown that the katA gene, encoding a cytoplasmic catalase in A. actinomycetemcomitans, was responsible for the reduction of HO produced by S. sanguinis, which consequently increased the biomass of P. gingivalis in tri-species biofilms. Collectively, these findings reveal that polymicrobial interactions play important roles in shaping bacterial community in biofilm. The existence of catalase producers may support the colonization of pathogens vulnerable to HO, in the oral cavity. The catalase may be a potential drug target to aid in the prevention of periodontitis.",

We therefore set out to demonstrate the beginning of a pathogen-selective drug discovery method using the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis as a model. Through our knowledge of metabolic networks and essential genes we identified a \"druggable\" essential target, meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase, which is found in a limited number of species. We adopted a high-throughput virtual screen method on the ZINC chemical library to select a group of potential small-molecule inhibitors. Meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase from P. gingivalis was first expressed and purified in Escherichia coli then characterized for enzymatic inhibitor screening studies. Several inhibitors with similar structural scaffolds containing a sulfonamide core and aromatic substituents showed dose-dependent inhibition. These compounds were further assayed showing reasonable whole-cell activity and the inhibition mechanism was determined. We conclude that the establishment of this target and screening strategy provides a model for the future development of new antimicrobials.",

        "abstract": "Biofilms are a key component in bacterial communities providing protection and contributing to infectious diseases. However, mechanisms involved in S. sanguinis biofilm formation have not been clearly elucidated. Here, we report the identification of a novel S. sanguinis TetR repressor, brpT (Biofilm Regulatory Protein TetR), involved in biofilm formation. Deletion of brpT resulted in a significant increase in biofilm formation. Interestingly, the mutant accumulated more water soluble and water insoluble glucans in its biofilm compared to the wild-type and the complemented mutant. The brpT mutation led to an altered biofilm morphology and structure exhibiting a rougher appearance, uneven distribution with more filaments bound to the chains. RNA-sequencing revealed that gtfP, the only glucosyltransferase present in S. sanguinis, was significantly up-regulated. In agreement with these findings, we independently observed that deletion of gtfP in S. sanguinis led to reduced biofilm and low levels of water soluble and insoluble glucans. These results suggest that brpT is involved in the regulation of the gtfP-mediated exopolysaccharide synthesis and controls S. sanguinis biofilm formation. The deletion of brpT may have a potential therapeutic application in regulating S. sanguinis colonization in the oral cavity and the prevention of dental caries.",

        "abstract": "Biofilms play important roles in microbial communities and are related to infectious diseases. Here, we report direct evidence that a bacterial nox gene encoding NADH oxidase is involved in biofilm formation. A dramatic reduction in biofilm formation was observed in a Streptococcus sanguinis nox mutant under anaerobic conditions without any decrease in growth. The membrane fluidity of the mutant bacterial cells was found to be decreased and the fatty acid composition altered, with increased palmitic acid and decreased stearic acid and vaccenic acid. Extracellular DNA of the mutant was reduced in abundance and bacterial competence was suppressed. Gene expression analysis in the mutant identified two genes with altered expression, gtfP and Idh, which were found to be related to biofilm formation through examination of their deletion mutants. NADH oxidase-related metabolic pathways were analyzed, further clarifying the function of this enzyme in biofilm formation.",

We examined the vaginal microbiome in two cohorts of women who experienced normal term births: a cross-sectionally sampled cohort of 613 pregnant and 1,969 non-pregnant women, focusing on 300 pregnant and 300 non-pregnant women of African, Hispanic or European ancestry case-matched for race, gestational age and household income; and a longitudinally sampled cohort of 90 pregnant women of African or non-African ancestry. In these women, the vaginal microbiome shifted during pregnancy toward Lactobacillus-dominated profiles at the expense of taxa often associated with vaginal dysbiosis. The shifts occurred early in pregnancy, followed predictable patterns, were associated with simplification of the metabolic capacity of the microbiome and were significant only in women of African or Hispanic ancestry. Both genomic and environmental factors are likely contributors to these trends, with socioeconomic status as a likely environmental influence.",

        "abstract": "Here we report for the first time that the  Streptococcus sanguinis  nox  gene encoding NADH oxidase is involved in both competition with  Streptococcus mutans  and virulence for infective endocarditis. A  S. sanguinis  nox  mutant was found to fail to inhibit the growth of  Streptococcus mutans  under microaerobic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, the recombinant Nox protein of  S. sanguinis  could reduce oxygen to water and oxidize NADH to NAD + . The oxidation of NADH to NAD +  was diminished in the  nox  mutant. The  nox  mutant exhibited decreased levels of extracellular H 2 O 2 ; however, the intracellular level of H 2 O 2  in the mutant was increased. Furthermore, the virulence of  nox  mutant was attenuated in a rabbit endocarditis model. The  nox  mutant was also shown to be more sensitive to blood killing and oxidative and acid stresses and reduced growth in serum. Thus, NADH oxidase contributes to multiple phenotypes related to competitiveness in the oral cavity and systemic virulence.",

        "abstract": "Meso-Diaminopimelic acid (meso-2,6-diamino-heptanedioic acid, DAP) is an important component of the cell wall of many bacteria. Meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (m-Ddh) is a critical enzyme in the process of converting tetrahydrodipicolinate to DAP. Here, we are proposing that DAP analogs targeting m-Ddh may be considered as potential antibiotics. Four DAP analogs without significant structural change from DAP have been obtained and their inhibitory potencies against m-Ddh from the P.\u00a0gingivalis strain W83 show significant differences from that of DAP. However, their inhibitory mechanisms as for how simple structural change influences the inhibitory potency remain unknown. Therefore, we employed molecular modeling methods to obtain insight into the inhibitory mechanisms of DAP and analogs with m-Ddh. The predicted binding mode of DAP was highly consistent with the experimental structural data and disclosed the important roles played by the binding pocket residues. According to our predictions, the isoxazoline ring of compounds 1 and 2 and the double bonds in compounds 3 and 4 had distinct influences on these compounds' binding to m-Ddh. This enriched understanding of the inhibitory mechanisms of DAP and these four analogs to m-Ddh has provided new and relevant information for future rational development of potent inhibitors targeting m-Ddh.",

        "abstract": "Even though the oral microbiome is one of the most complex sites on the body it is an excellent model for narrow-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Current research indicates disruption of the microbiome leads to a dysbiotic environment allowing for the overgrowth of pathogenic species and the onset of oral diseases. The gram-negative colonizer, Porphyromonas gingivalis has long been considered a key player in the initiation of periodontitis and Streptococcus mutans has been linked to dental caries. With antibiotic research still on the decline, new strategies are greatly needed to combat infectious diseases. By targeting key pathogens, it may be possible to treat oral infections while allowing for the recolonization of the beneficial, healthy flora. In this review, we examine unique strategies to specifically target periodontal pathogens and address what is needed for the success of these approaches in the microbiome era.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "The ancient and pluripotent progranulins contain multiple repeats of a cysteine-rich sequence motif of \u223c60 amino acids, called the granulin/epithelin module (GEM) with a prototypic structure of four \u03b2-hairpins zipped together by six inter-hairpin disulfide bonds. Prevalence of this disulfide-enforced structure is assessed here by an expression screening of 19 unique GEM sequences of the four progranulins in the zebrafish genome, progranulins 1, 2, A and B. While a majority of the expressed GEM peptides did not exhibit uniquely-folded conformations, module AaE from progranulin A and AbB from progranulin B were found to fold into the protopypic 4-hairpin structure along with disulfide formation. Module AaE has the most-rigid three-dimensional structure with all four \u03b2-hairpins defined using high-resolution (H- N) NMR spectroscopy, including 492 inter-proton nuclear Overhauser effects, 23  J(HN,H ) coupling constants, 22 hydrogen bonds as well as residual dipolar coupling constants. Three-dimensional structure of AaE and the partially-folded AbB re-iterate the conformational stability of the N-terminal stack of two beta-hairpins and varying degrees of structural flexibility for the C-terminal half of the 4-hairpin global fold of the GEM repeat. A cell-based assay demonstrated a functional activity for the zebrafish granulin AaE in promoting the survival of neuronal cells, similarly to what has been found for the corresponding granulin E module in human progranulin. Finally, this work highlights the remaining challenges in structure-activity studies of proteins containing the GEM repeats, due to the apparent prevalence of structural disorder in GEM motifs despite potentially a high density of intramolecular disulfide bonds.

        "abstract": "The increased interest in using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a platform for biopharmaceuticals has led to the need for new analytical techniques that can precisely assess physicochemical properties of these large and very complex drugs for the purpose of correctly identifying quality attributes (QA). One QA, higher order structure (HOS), is unique to biopharmaceuticals and essential for establishing consistency in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, detecting process-related variations from manufacturing changes and establishing comparability between biologic products. To address this measurement challenge, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2D-NMR) methods were introduced that allow for the precise atomic-level comparison of the HOS between two proteins, including mAbs. Here, an inter-laboratory comparison involving 26 industrial, government and academic laboratories worldwide was performed as a benchmark using the NISTmAb, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to facilitate the translation of the 2D-NMR method into routine use for biopharmaceutical product development. Two-dimensional H,N and H,C NMR spectra were acquired with harmonized experimental protocols on the unlabeled Fab domain and a uniformly enriched-N, 20%-C-enriched system suitability sample derived from the NISTmAb. Chemometric analyses from over 400 spectral maps acquired on 39 different NMR spectrometers ranging from 500\u00a0MHz to 900\u00a0MHz demonstrate spectral fingerprints that are fit-for-purpose for the assessment of HOS. The 2D-NMR method is shown to provide the measurement reliability needed to move the technique from an emerging technology to a harmonized, routine measurement that can be generally applied with great confidence to high precision assessments of the HOS of mAb-based biotherapeutics.",

The extent to which the F2-FVa interaction affects the overall thrombin generation, however, is uncertain. To study this interaction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of recombinant F2 was used to identify seven residues within F2 that are significantly responsive to FVa binding. The functional role of this region in interacting with FVa during prothrombin activation was verified by the FVa-dependent inhibition of thrombin generation using peptides that mimic the same region of F2. Because six of the seven residues were within a 9-residue span, these were mutated to generate a prothrombin derivative (PT6). These mutations led to a decreased affinity for FVa as determined by surface plasmon resonance. When thrombin generation by an array of FXa containing prothrombinase components was monitored, a 54% decrease in thrombin generation was observed with PT6 compared with the wild-type, only when FVa was present. The functional significance of the specific low-affinity binding between F2 and FVa is discussed within the context of a dynamic model of molecular interactions between prothrombin and FVa engaging multiple contact sites.",

        "abstract": "It was reported that DNA repair can confer cancer cell resistance to therapeutic treatments by activating antiapoptotic cellular defense. We hypothesized that genetic variants of DNA repair genes may be associated with lung cancer prognosis. Seventeen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (tagSNPs) selected from 12 DNA repair genes were genotyped in 280 advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by TaqMan assay. The associations of these SNPs and overall survival of advanced NSCLC patients were investigated. Advanced NSCLC patients carrying ERCC2 rs50872 CT+TT genotypes had significantly longer median survival time (MST) and decreased death risk than patients with rs50872 CC genotype [log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.031; adjusted HR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.73 (0.55-0.98), P\u00a0=\u00a00.033]. These effects were mainly seen among younger patients (\u226465\u00a0years old) [HR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.57 (0.37-0.87), P\u00a0=\u00a00.010], patients without surgery [HR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.68 (0.47-0.98), P\u00a0=\u00a00.036] but with chemotherapy [HR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.64 (0.46-0.91), P\u00a0=\u00a00.012] or radiotherapy [HR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.58 (0.38-0.89), P\u00a0=\u00a00.013]. Meanwhile, compared to advanced NSCLC patients with rs25487 GG genotype, patients carrying XRCC1 rs25487 GA+AA genotypes had significantly shorter MST (MST\u00a0=\u00a011.7 vs. 16.7, log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.048). In addition, advanced NSCLC patients carrying the ERCC2 rs50872 CC in combination with XRCC1 rs25487 GA+AA genotype had the shortest MST (11.2\u00a0month) and highest death risk [HR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.70 (1.15-2.52), P\u00a0=\u00a00.008] when compared with those carrying rs50872 CT+TT and rs25487 GG genotype (MST\u00a0=\u00a022.0\u00a0month). The ERCC2 rs50872 T allele was associated with favorable but XRCC1 rs25487 A allele with bad survival for advanced NSCLC in Chinese population, which may offer novel biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes.

        "abstract": "Buried pipelines influenced by coal mining subsidence will deform and generate additional stress during surface deformation. On the basis of the coordinating deformation relationship between buried pipeline and its surrounding soils, a stress analysis method of a buried pipeline induced by mining was proposed. The buried pipeline additional stresses were analyzed; meanwhile, a corresponding analysis process of the pipeline stresses was also presented during mining subsidence. Furthermore, based on the ground subsidence along the pipeline predicted in advance by the probability integral method, the additional stresses and Von Mises equivalent stresses and their distributions along the buried pipeline induced by the exploitation of a coal mining working face named 14101 were obtained. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of additional stresses between simulation and analytical calculation was performed for the deep analysis and reliability of the results presented by the proposed methodology in this paper. The proposed method provides references for analysis of the additional stress and safety of buried pipelines under the influence of mining subsidence.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The current practice for the design of squeezed branch piles is mainly based on the calculated bearing capacity of circular piles. Insufficient considerations of the load-transfer mechanism, branch effect and failure mechanism, as well as overreliance on pile load tests, have led to conservative designs and limited application. This study performs full-scale field load tests on instrumented squeezed branch piles and shows that the shaft force curves have obvious drop steps at the branch position, indicating that the branches can effectively share the pile top load. The effects of branch position, spacing, number and diameter on the pile bearing capacity are analyzed numerically. The numerical results indicate that the squeezed branch piles have two types of failure mechanisms, i.e. individual branch failure mechanism and cylindrical failure mechanism. Further research should focus on the development of the calculation method to determine the bearing capacities of squeezed branch piles considering these two failure mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "The method of determining concrete fracture energy recommended by RILEM has an obvious size effect, so determining fracture energy that is unaffected by size of the test specimen is difficult. In this study, 60 high-strength concrete single-edge notched beams (SENBs) of different sizes, crack length-to-depth ratios, and span-to-depth ratios were subjected to the three-point loading test as recommended by RILEM. Then, the influences of the boundary effect on the fracture energy were identified. Based on the SENB boundary effect model, a piecewise function of the interrelationships between the experimental test fracture energy , the local fracture energy , and the fracture energy unaffected by specimen size  was established. The applicability of the boundary effect model was verified using the test results from this study and from the previously published research. The results show that the local fracture energy distribution in the boundary influence region was nonuniform. The smaller the local fracture energy was, the closer it was to the rear boundary of the specimen. The influence length  of the boundary increased with the increasing specimen size. Based on the bilinear distribution model of the local fracture energy , the fracture energy unaffected by beam size  can be obtained according to the fracture energy  measured for laboratory-scale small-sized SENB specimens. Furthermore, the model predictions are in good agreement with experimental observations.",

        "abstract": "Overactivity of the renin\u2013angiotensin system, oxidative stress, and cyclooxygenases (COX) in the brain are implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We previously reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpression in the brain attenuates the development of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension, a neurogenic hypertension model with enhanced brain renin\u2013angiotensin system and sympathetic activity. To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we investigated whether oxidative stress, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase (COX) activation in the brain are modulated by ACE2 in neurogenic hypertension. Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension significantly increased expression of Nox-2 (+61\u00b15%), Nox-4 (+50\u00b113%), and nitrotyrosine (+89\u00b132%) and reduced activity of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (\u221229\u00b14%) and superoxide dismutase (\u221231\u00b17%), indicating increased oxidative stress in the brain of nontransgenic mice. This increased oxidative stress was attenuated in transgenic mice overexpressing ACE2 in the brain. Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt\u2013induced reduction of neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression (\u221226\u00b17%) and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase/total endothelial nitric oxide synthase (\u221230\u00b13%), and enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase B and extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase 1/2 in the paraventricular nucleus, were reversed by ACE2 overexpression. In addition, ACE2 overexpression blunted the hypertension-mediated increase in gene and protein expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in the paraventricular nucleus. Furthermore, gene silencing of either COX-1 or COX-2 in the brain, reduced microglial activation and accompanied neuroinflammation, ultimately attenuating Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension. Together, these data provide evidence that brain ACE2 overexpression reduces oxidative stress and COX-mediated neuroinflammation, improves antioxidant and nitric oxide signaling, and thereby attenuates the development of neurogenic hypertension.",

Midbodies persist in cells long after division as midbody derivatives (MBds), but their fate is unclear. Here we show that MBds are inherited asymmetrically by the daughter cell with the older centrosome. They selectively accumulate in stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and potential cancer \u2018stem cells\u2019 in vivo and in vitro. MBd loss accompanies stem-cell differentiation, and involves autophagic degradation mediated by binding of the autophagic receptor NBR1 to the midbody protein CEP55. Differentiating cells and normal dividing cells do not accumulate MBds and possess high autophagic activity. Stem cells and cancer cells accumulate MBds by evading autophagosome encapsulation and exhibit low autophagic activity. MBd enrichment enhances reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells and increases the in vitro tumorigenicity of cancer cells. These results indicate unexpected roles for MBds in stem cells and cancer \u2018stem cells\u2019. Download references",

Midbodies persist in cells long after division as midbody derivatives (MB(d)s), but their fate is unclear. Here we show that MB(d)s are inherited asymmetrically by the daughter cell with the older centrosome. They selectively accumulate in stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and potential cancer 'stem cells' in vivo and in vitro. MB(d) loss accompanies stem-cell differentiation, and involves autophagic degradation mediated by binding of the autophagic receptor NBR1 to the midbody protein CEP55. Differentiating cells and normal dividing cells do not accumulate MB(d)s and possess high autophagic activity. Stem cells and cancer cells accumulate MB(d)s by evading autophagosome encapsulation and exhibit low autophagic activity. MB(d) enrichment enhances reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells and increases the in vitro tumorigenicity of cancer cells. These results indicate unexpected roles for MB(d)s in stem cells and cancer 'stem cells'.",

We characterized maturation dynamics of thymic epithelial cells in\u00a0vivo, classified cell maturation state in a thymic organ culture, and revealed the intrinsic capacity of thymic epithelium to preserve transcriptional regularity despite exposure to exogenous retinoic acid. Finally, by integrating the cell atlas with human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and autoimmune-disease-related genes, we implicated embryonic thymus-resident cells as possible participants in autoimmune disease etiologies.

The spectral adaptive grouping distributed compressive sensing (AGDCS) algorithm is proposed, which enables a distributed compressed sensing reconstruction of plant hyperspectral data. The spectral characteristics of hyperspectral data are analyzed and the joint sparse model is constructed. The spectral bands are adaptively grouped and the hyperspectral data are compressed and reconstructed on the basis of grouping. The experimental results showed that, compared with orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR), AGDCS can significantly improve the visual effect of image reconstruction in the spatial domain. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) at a low sampling rate (the sampling rate is lower than 0.2) increases by 13.72 dB than OMP and 1.66 dB than GPSR. In the spectral domain, the average normalized root mean square error, the mean absolute percentage error, and the mean absolute error of AGDCS is 35.38%, 31.83%, and 33.33% lower than GPSR, respectively. Additionally, AGDCS can achieve relatively high reconstructed efficiency.",

The key physiological and biochemical parameters such as water content, carotenoid content and chlorophyll content were chosen to test the retrieving efficacy of the greedy compressive sensing algorithms of MP, ROMP, OMP, StOMP and CoSaMP at different sampling rates. The performances of all algorithms are thoroughly evaluated on three different levels: the spectral level, the feature level and the model level. The experimental results show that the errors of these three levels of all methods are regularly changed with the sampling rate. For the spectral level, the error of spectral reconstruction of all algorithms stabilized within 2% when the sampling rate is higher than 0.15bpp. For the feature level, the spectral indices of all algorithms exhibited a decreasing trend with the increase of the sampling rate. When the sampling rate is higher than 0.2bpp, the errors of the reconstructed spectral indices of all methods are lower than 2%. For the model level, the reconstructed normalized root mean square error of chlorophyll and carotenoids of all methods are reduced to 8% and 12% respectively at the sampling rate of 0.25bpp. For the error of water content, the reconstruction errors of MP and ROMP are about 24% and those of OMP, StOMP and CoSaMP were lower than 15% at the sampling rate of 0.4bpp. Therefore, these greedy compressive sensing algorithms not only reduce the data volume of plant spectra significantly, but also maintain plant critical spectral characteristics.",

Firstly, the spatial block size of hyperspectral images is adaptively obtained according to the spatial self-correlation coefficient. Secondly, a k-means clustering algorithm is used to group the hyperspectral images. Thirdly, we use a local means and local standard deviations (LMLSD) algorithm to find the optimal image in the group as the key band, and the non-key bands in the group can be smoothed by linear prediction. Fourthly, the random Gaussian measurement matrix is used as the sampling matrix, and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) matrix serves as the sparse basis. Finally, the stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit (StOMP) is used to reconstruct the hyperspectral images. The experimental results show that the proposed PSSAHCS algorithm can achieve better evaluation results-the subjective evaluation, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, and the spatial autocorrelation coefficient in the spatial domain, and spectral curve comparison and correlation between spectra-reconstructed performance in the spectral domain-than those of single spectral compression sensing (SSCS), block hyperspectral compressive sensing (BHCS), and adaptive grouping distributed compressive sensing (AGDCS).

Firstly, the spatial block size of hyperspectral images is adaptively obtained according to the spatial self-correlation coefficient. Secondly, a k-means clustering algorithm is used to group the hyperspectral images. Thirdly, we use a local means and local standard deviations (LMLSD) algorithm to find the optimal image in the group as the key band, and the non-key bands in the group can be smoothed by linear prediction. Fourthly, the random Gaussian measurement matrix is used as the sampling matrix, and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) matrix serves as the sparse basis. Finally, the stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit (StOMP) is used to reconstruct the hyperspectral images. The experimental results show that the proposed PSSAHCS algorithm can achieve better evaluation results-the subjective evaluation, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, and the spatial autocorrelation coefficient in the spatial domain, and spectral curve comparison and correlation between spectra-reconstructed performance in the spectral domain-than those of single spectral compression sensing (SSCS), block hyperspectral compressive sensing (BHCS), and adaptive grouping distributed compressive sensing (AGDCS). PSSAHCS can not only compress and reconstruct hyperspectral images effectively, but also has strong denoise performance.",

The planar-array of micro-blazed grating has been proposed to realize 2D PST based on its interesting properties such as high diffraction efficiency, small size, high degree of integration, and easy to fabricate. 2D PST could be realized in free space through controling the etching direction and the period of micro-blazed grating, which results in signal beams can reach the desired spatial position. Unlike the conventional method depending on the operation of dividing, magnification, interlacing, and superimposing, this approach, which mainly relies on the diffractive properties of signal beams and the distribution of light intensity, presents a single diffractive element to perform 2D PST. Thus, this approach has the advantages of high energy efficiency, high feasibility, compact in structure, and easy to integrate. The theoretical analyses and the experimental results show that it should be helpful in optical interconnection network, especially, in PS omega network.",

        "abstract": "Based on some interesting properties of a micro-blazed grating planar-array such as high diffraction efficiency, small size, high degree of integration and easy to fabricate, a 2D Perfect Shuffle (PS) transform method was proposed. The mathematic principles and the mapping rule of 1D and 2D PS transform were defined, respectively. Then, 1D and 2D PS transforms were realized in free space using micro-blazed grating arrays by controling and modulating the grating's etching direction and period to direct the signal beams to reach to the desired position. Finally, compared with the conventional method (depend on the operation of dividing, magnification, interlacing and superimposing), this method mainly relying on the diffractive properties of signal beams and the distribution of light intensity presents a single diffractive element to perform 1D and 2D PS transform. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show this method has the advantages of more higher energy efficiency, high feasibility, compact structure, easy to integrate etc., which should be helpful in a optical interconnection network, especially, in a perfect shuffle omega network.",

The left inverse perfect shuffle, right perfect shuffle and right inverse perfect shuffle are discussed complementally based on some reports on left perfect shuffle in previous papers. According to the different grating period values, a 1 \u00d7 8 micro-blazed grating array element for realizing 8-channel left perfect shuffle transformation is fabricated with very large scale integration (VLSI), stepping photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE). Similarly, depending on the micro-blazed grating array with different period values, the left inverse perfect shuffle, right perfect shuffle and right inverse perfect shuffle transformation also can be accomplished. Experimental results show obviously that, comparing with conventional methods, it has advantages of small size, compact structure, easy to integrate, high diffraction efficiency (95% or so in principle), and high performance. Thus, it is helpful to the construction of multistage perfect shuffle interconnection network.",

Based on its characteristics and applications, a new technology was proposed, which computer-generated blazed grating array could realize PS transformation including inverse perfect shuffle (IPS) and left perfect shuffle (LPS).

Moreover, the method of bipartition graph was adopted to ascertain the node state of each stage (straight or crossover). At last, a module of the rearrangeable nonblocking Omega network, which was integrated with polarizing beam-splitter, \u03bb/2 wave plate and perfect shuffle plates, was constructed. It has the advantages of switching transparent, low crosstalk, high bandwidth etc, and can accomplish the operation of sorting and permutation of 8-channel optical signals without routing conflict.

Diazepam was used as the internal standard. The method involves a simple liquid\u2013liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a Shim-pack VP-ODS analytical column (2.0\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0mm, 5\u00a0\u03bcm) with gradient elution using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1\u00a0% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.2\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u22121. The detection was performed by multiple reaction monitoring mode via a positive electrospray ionization interface. The calibration curves were linear for all analytes over investigated range. The lower limits of quantification were 7.734\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121 for DPT, 1.973\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121 for M1, 7.969\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121 for M2, and 1.973\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121 for M7, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision values were less than 10.59\u00a0%, and the accuracy ranged from \u22126.787 to 12.74\u00a0%. The extraction recoveries of the analytes were higher than 90\u00a0% and in this method no apparent matrix effect was observed. The validated method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic study of DPT and its main metabolites in rat plasma.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidences demonstrated that statins impaired glucose utilization. This study was aimed to investigate whether PXR was involved in the atorvastatin-impaired glucose utilization. Rifampicin/PCN served as PXR activator control. Glucose utilization, glucose uptake, protein levels of GLUT2, GCK, PDK2, PEPCK1 and G6Pase in HepG2 cells were measured. PXR inhibitors, PXR overexpression and PXR siRNA were applied to verify the role of PXR in atorvastatin-impaired glucose utilization in cells. Hypercholesterolemia rats induced by high fat diet feeding, orally received atorvastatin (5 and 10mg/kg), pravastatin (10mg/kg) for 14 days, or intraperitoneally received PCN (35mg/kg) for 4 days. Results showed that glucose utilization was markedly inhibited by atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin and rifampicin. Neither rosuvastatin nor pravastatin showed the similar effect. Atorvastatin and pravastatin were selected for the following study. Atorvastatin and rifampicin significantly inhibited glucose uptake and down-regulated GLUT2 and GCK expressions. Similarly, overexpressed PXR significantly down-regulated GLUT2 and GCK expressions and impaired glucose utilization. Ketoconazole and resveratrol attenuated the impaired glucose utilization by atorvastatin and rifampicin in both parental and overexpressed PXR cells. PXR knockdown significantly up-regulated GLUT2 and GCK proteins and abolished the decreased glucose consumption and uptake by atorvastatin and rifampicin. Animal experiments showed that atorvastatin and PCN significantly elicited postprandial hyperglycemia, leading to increase in glucose AUC. Expressions of GLUT2 and GCK in rat livers were markedly down-regulated by atorvastatin and PCN. In conclusion, atorvastatin impaired glucose utilization in hepatocytes via repressing GLUT2 and GCK expressions, which may be partly due to PXR activation.",

        "abstract": "Clozapine (CLZ) was reported to be associated with hepatotoxicity. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) has a liver protective effect. Our preliminary experiments showed that GA aggravated rather than attenuated CLZ-induced hepatotoxicity in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The study aimed to describe the enhancing effect of GA on CLZ-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. Data from primary cultured rat hepatocytes showed the decreased formation of metabolites demethylclozapine (nor-CLZ) and clozapine N-oxide (CLZ N-oxide). The results in vivo showed that 7-day CLZ treatment led to marked accumulation of triglyceride (TG) and increase in \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT) activity, liver weight, and serum AST in rats. Co-administration of GA enhanced the increases in hepatic TG, \u03b3-GT, liver weight, and serum total cholesterol induced by CLZ. GA decreased plasma concentrations of nor-CLZ and CLZ N-oxide. Compared with control rats, hepatic microsomes of GA rats exhibited the decreased formations of nor-CLZ and CLZ N-oxide, accompanied by decreases in activities of CYP2C11 and CYP2C19 and increased activity of CYP1A2. QT-PCR analysis demonstrated that GA enhanced expression of CYP1A2, but suppressed expression of CYP2C11 and CYP2C13. All these results support the conclusion that GA aggravated CLZ-induced hepatotoxicity, which was partly via inhibiting CYP2C11 and CYP2C13 or inducing CYP1A2.",

One technology potentially capable of realizing such systems uses the multistep micro-blazed grating optical beam deflectors based on binary and multiple-phase modulation methods. The micro-optical element has been fabricated by introducing very large scale integration (VLSI), stepping photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE), which can realize beam steering, deflecting, splitting, and switching in free space, and its diffraction properties are determined by the blazed-grating parameters, such as the number of steps, grating depth, grating period, as well as blazed profile. The theoretical analysis and primarily experimental result show that this phase-type element has the advantages of high diffractive efficiency, low cross talk, small feature size, and high reliability due to nonmechanical beam steering without any moving parts. Hence it is ideally suited to applications in optical communication and optical interconnection network.",

A smart and compact SW-banyan network with a 2 x 2 node switch is proposed that uses polarizing beamsplitters (PBSs), phase spatial light modulators (PSLMs), and mirrors. PBS features include an s-component (perpendicular to the incident plane) of the incident light beam that is reflected, and a p-component (parallel to the incident plane) that passes through it. According to switching logic, under the control of external electrical signals, a PSLM controls the routing paths of the signal beams, i.e., the polarization of each optical signal is rotated or not rotated 90 deg by a programmable PSLM. Since the proposed optical setup consists of only optical polarization elements, it is compact in structure and possesses a low energy loss, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and a large number of available optical channels. Finally, the discussions and experimental results show that the SW-banyan network proposed here may be used in optical communication and optical information processing.

Firstly, based on the link rule and function principle of the crossover network, the corresponding processing matrixes are achieved to denote and illustrate the relative signal operating and control and to establish the relation between input and output signals. According to the performing matrixes and the orders of input/output signal arrays, the node controlling and signal routing are determined. Finally, the signals are routed and controlled. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can not only be used in the routing control for a 8\u00d78 crossover optical interconnection network, but also can be used in those for 16\u00d716, 32\u00d732 and 64\u00d764 networks. Furthermore, it also has excellent transplant ability and compatibility for perfect shaffle networks and Banyan networks.

        "title": "Optical implementation of polarization-independent, bidirectional, nonblocking Clos network using polarization control technique in free space",
        "abstract": "The clos network is one of the earliest multistage interconnection networks. Recently, it has been widely studied in parallel optical information processing systems, and there have been many efforts to develop this network. In this paper, a smart and compact Clos network, including Clos(2,3,2) and Clos(2,4,2), is proposed by using polarizing beam-splitters (PBS), phase spatial light modulators (PSLM), and mirrors. PBS features that are s-component (perpendicular to the incident plane) of the incident light beam is reflected, and the p-component (parallel to the incident plane) passes through it. According to switching logic, under control of external electrical signals, PSLM functions to control routing paths of the signal beams, i.e., the polarization of each optical signal is rotated or not rotated 90\u00b0 by a programmable PSLM. This new type of configuration grants the features of less optical components, compact in structure, efficient in performance, and insensitive to polarization of signal beam. In addition, the straight, the exchange, and the broadcast functions of the basic switch element are implemented bidirectionally in free-space. Furthermore, the new optical experimental module of 2\u00d73 and 2\u00d74 optical switch is also presented by a cascading polarization- independent bidirectional 2\u00d72 optical switch. Simultaneously, the routing state-table of 2\u00d73 and 2\u00d74 optical switch to perform all permutation output and nonblocking switch for the input signal beam, is achieved. Since the proposed optical setup consists of only optical polarization elements, it is compact in structure, and possesses a low energy loss, a high signal-to-ratio, and an available large number of optical channels. Finally, the discussions and the experimental results show that the Clos network proposed here should be helpful in the design of large-scale network matrix, and may be used in optical communication and optical information processing. \u00a9 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",

The field-emission properties of four kinds of ZnO nanorods have been invested and the awl-shaped nanorods of ZnO have preferable characteristics due to the smallest emitter radius on the nanoscale in the tip in comparison with other nanorods. The growth mechanism of the ZnO nanorods can be explained on the basis of the vapor-liquid- solid (VLS) processes. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.",

The room-temperature photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the prepared nanowires are measured. Among the four PL peaks, the peak of 418 nm is newly observed. This peak is caused by the plane defects of the twinned crystal nanowires. The formation of SnO2 nanowires at low temperature is pursued on the basis of the VLS mechanism and application of the reaction source of SnO. We suggest that the chemical reactions of the low temperature and low concentration of the vaporized species are responsible for the thinner size of the SnO2 nanowires.",

        "abstract": "ZnO-In2O3 one-dimensional (1D) nanosized heterostructures constructed by ZnO belts and In2O3 tooth-like particles were self-assembled on single crystal silicon substrate using thermal chemical vapor transport and condensation without being aided by any metal catalyst. The morphology, structure, and composition of the as-synthesized 1D heterostructures were analyzed in detail. The widths of the ZnO nanobelts ranged from several tens of nanometers to one micrometer, and the lengths ranged from several tens to one hundred of micrometers. In2O3 tooth-like nanoparticles with sizes of about 50-100 nm were found grown at two edges of ZnO nanobelts. ZnO nanobelts grew along [10 (1) over bar0] direction, whereas In2O3 nanoteeth grew along [31 (1) over bar], [3 (1) over bar1], [(3) over bar(1) over bar1], and [(3) over bar1 (1) over bar] directions so as to form rhombus-shaped structures. The growth mechanism of the nanosized heterostructures was discussed on the basis of the vapor-solid process and polar surface effect of ZnO nanobelts. Field emission characteristics of the as-prepared heterostructures were measured and explained by energy band theory of heterostructure in detail. It is important to note that the 2D electronics gas (2DEG) was formed between the ZnO energy band bending down and the interface of the heterostructure. The successive tunneling of 2DEG that took place from ZnO to In2O3 and then from In2O3 to vacuum was the main reason resulting in electronics emission for the nanosized heterostructures in the process of field emission.",

        "abstract": "Many people apply the \"larger area-larger perimeter\" rule to solve the perimeter comparison problems, even in situations where this intuitive rule is misleading. To investigate whether inhibitory control is needed in the perimeter comparison reasoning and whether the efficiency of inhibitory control varies with students' ages and achievements, we designed a negative priming paradigm and conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, a negative priming effect was observed in both Chinese primary school students (n\u202f=\u202f123) and college students (n\u202f=\u202f42) when they were solving a perimeter comparison task. In Experiment 2 (N\u202f=\u202f86), we found that the negative priming effect existed in both high-achieving and low-achieving primary school students, but the magnitude of this effect appeared to be smaller in high-achieving students. These results imply that success in solving geometry quantitative problems requires the ability to inhibit the larger area-larger perimeter intuition in some situations and also that high-achieving students are more capable of doing so.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-elicited immunosuppression is one of the essential mechanisms for tumor evasion of immune surveillance. It is widely thought to be one of the main reasons for the failure of tumor immunotherapy. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells that play an important role in tumor-induced immunosuppression. These cells expand in tumor-bearing individuals and suppress T cell responses via various mechanisms. Curdlan, the linear (1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-\u03b2-glucan from Agrobacterium, has been applied in the food industry and other sectors. The\u00a0anti-tumor\u00a0property\u00a0of\u00a0curdlan has been recognized for a long time although the underlying mechanism still needs to be explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of curdlan on MDSCs and found that curdlan could promote MDSCs to differentiate into a more mature state and then significantly reduce the suppressive function of MDSCs, decrease the MDSCs in vivo and down-regulate the suppression in tumor-bearing mice, thus leading to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. We, therefore, increase the understanding of further mechanisms by which curdlan achieves anti-tumor effects. ",

We find that thin coatings of the defects can dramatically change the transmission behaviors. For example, perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) defects embedded in an INZ or ENZ metamaterial yield total reflections for transverse magnetic polarized waves (Hao et al., Appl Phys Lett 96:101109, 2010). However, if the PMC defects are coated with dielectric shells, total transmissions could be achieved by tuning their permittivity values or geometric sizes. The permittivity differences of dielectric shells for total reflections and transmissions in the INZ or ENZ metamaterial could be very small, implying potential applications, such as ultrasensitive sensors and switches.",

In this paper, magnetically controlled index-near-zero metamaterials and \u03bc-near-zero metamaterials based on ferrite have been realized. Combining these proposed metamaterials with proper waveguide structures, we have obtained a tunable index-near-zero structure and a tunable \u03bc-near-zero structure, respectively. For both structures, transmittance can be tuned by bias magnetic field in a wide range with high sensitivity. Our proposed tunable zero-index metamaterial structures have potential applications in microwave devices such as switches, sensors and modulators. Besides, the tunable \u03bc-near-zero structure possesses a multifrequency tunneling effect and can be used to implement a tunable filter.",

The optical Tamm state is associated with a sharp transmission peak and strong localization of the electric field. It is spectrally located inside the overlapping band gaps. The shift of the optical Tamm state is sensitive to the lattice constant of the inhomogeneous material. Our results provide an approach to tailor interface states in a controllable manner.",

        "abstract": "Optical logic gates are important elements in optical computing and optical circuits. In this study, all-optical logic gates, including OR, XOR, XNOR, NAND, and NOT gates, are obtained in a composite structure composed of gyroelectric material and metal based on the interference and absorption of surface waves. In the composite structure, a Y-shaped channel through which surface plasmon polaritons propagate unidirectionally is formed. Through the ingenious one-way surface plasmon polaritons, backscattering and side-scattering generated by the composite structure and influencing the surrounding devices are prohibited effectively. The precisely controlled optical phase difference ensures the realization of five different logic gates with high contrast ratios. The maximum contrast ratios for XOR, XNOR, NAND, and NOT gates are 31.64\u00a0dB, 43.47\u00a0dB, 31.47\u00a0dB, and 43.47\u00a0dB, respectively. The output logic states \"1\"or \"0\" obtained by different logic inputs have nearly the same light intensity. Our research results provide the possibility for constructing all-optical integrated logic devices.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disorder representing a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Invasive and migratory phenotypes are acquired by trophoblasts through the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Studies have shown that trophoblast EMT events are dysregulated in PE and play an important role in its development. Dysregulation of interleukin (IL)-27 and IL-27R (T-cell cytokine receptor (TCCR)/WSX -1) is relevant to PE. In this study, our results demonstrated that IL-27 did not significantly affect the proliferation and apoptosis of HTR -8/SVneo trophoblast cells, while it did significantly inhibit trophoblast invasion and migration. The expression of EMT-related proteins in HTR-8/SVneo cells and extravillous explants was detected after treatment with IL-27. Expression of epithelial markers was increased, and mesenchymal marker expression was reduced. Furthermore, we found that IL-27 could induce significant phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) in a time-dependent manner in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Selective inhibitors of STAT1 (STAT1 siRNA) and STAT3 (STAT3 siRNA) were used to determine whether both STAT1 and STAT3 are required for IL-27-mediated inhibition of EMT. STAT1 inhibition in IL-27-treated cells attenuated the IL-27 effect, while the inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. These results demonstrate that IL-27 may inhibit trophoblast cell migration and invasion by affecting the EMT process through an STAT1-dominant pathway in PE.",

        "abstract": "The selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR) of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDC) twins causes phenotypic growth discordance, which is correlated with metabolomic pertubations. A global, untargeted identification of the metabolic fingerprint may help elucidate the etiology of sIUGR. Umbilical cord blood and placentas collected from 15 pairs of sIUGR monochorionic twins, 24 pairs of uncomplicated twins, and 14 singletons diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses. Supervised multivariate regression analysis and pathway analysis were performed to compare control twins with sIUGR twins. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was utilized to explore metabolic differences within sIUGR co-twins. Linear logistic regression was applied to screen metabolites that significantly differed in concentration between control twins and sIUGR twins or IUGR singletons. Umbilical cord blood demonstrated better global metabolomic separation of sIUGR and control twins compared to the placenta. Disrupted amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as well as high levels of exposure to environmental xenobiotics were associated with sIUGR. The metabolic abnormalities in MCDA twins suggested that in utero growth discordance is caused by intrauterine and extrauterine environmental factors, rather than genetics. Thus, this study provides new therapeutic targets and strategies for sIUGR management and prevention.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is characterized by overexpression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and downregulation of catalase and more resistance to hydrogen peroxide (HO) than normal cells. Thus, relatively high HO promotes breast cancer cell growth and proliferation. However, excessive intracellular HO leads to death of breast cancer cells. In cancer cells, high level ascorbic acid (Asc) is able to be autoxidized and thus provides an electron to oxygen to generate HO. In the present study, we demonstrated that triethylenetetramine (TETA) enhances Asc autoxidation and thus elevates HO production in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, Asc/TETA combination significantly impaired cancer cell viability, while having much milder effects on normal cells, indicating Asc/TETA could be a promising therapy for breast cancer. Moreover, SOD1 and N-acetyl-L-cysteine failed to improve MCF-7 cells viability in the presence of Asc/TETA, while catalase significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity of Asc/TETA to breast cancer cells, strongly suggesting that the selective cytotoxicity of Asc/TETA to cancer cells is HO-dependent. In addition, Asc/TETA induces RAS/ERK downregulation in breast cancer cells. Animal studies confirmed that Asc/TETA effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, TETA synergizes pharmacologic Asc autoxidation and HO overproduction in breast cancer cells, which suppresses RAS/ERK pathway and results in apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Oral uptake of lycopene has been shown to be beneficial for preventing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the strong first-pass metabolism of lycopene influences its bioavailability and impedes its clinic application. In this study, we determined an intravenous (IV) administration dose of lycopene protects against myocardial infarction (MI) in a mouse model, and investigated the effects of acute lycopene administration on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and related signaling pathways during myocardial I/R. Methods: In this study, we established both in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell model and in vivo regional myocardial I/R mouse model by ligating left anterior artery descending. TTC dual staining was used to assess I/R induced MI in the absence and presence of acute lycopene administration via tail vein injection. Results: Lycopene treatment (1 \u03bcM) before reoxygenation significantly reduced cardiomyocyte death induced by H/R. Intravenous administration of lycopene to achieve 1 \u03bcM concentration in circulating blood significantly suppressed MI, ROS production, and JNK phosphorylation in the cardiac tissue of mice during in vivo regional I/R. Conclusion: Elevating circulating lycopene to 1 \u03bcM via IV injection protects against myocardial I/R injury through inhibition of ROS accumulation and consequent inflammation in mice.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by poor placentation, consequent on aberrant extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell function during placental development. The SRC family of proteins is important during pregnancy, especially SRC-3, which regulates placental morphogenesis and embryo survival. Although SRC-3 expression in mouse trophoblast giant cells has been documented, its role in the functional regulation of extravillous trophoblasts and the development of PE remains unknown. This study found that SRC-3 expression was significantly lower in placentas from PE pregnancies as compared to uncomplicated pregnancies. Additionally, both CoCl-mimicked hypoxia and suppression of endogenous SRC-3 expression by lentivirus short hairpin RNA attenuated the migration and invasion abilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that SRC-3 physically interacts with AKT to regulate the migration and invasion of HTR-8 cells, via the AKT/mTOR pathway. We also found that the inhibition of HTR-8 cell migration and invasion by CoCl-mimicked hypoxia was through the SRC-3/AKT/mTOR axis. Our findings indicate that, in early gestation, accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibits the expression of SRC-3, which impairs extravillous trophoblastic invasion and migration by directly interacting with AKT. This potentially leads to insufficient uterine spiral artery remodeling and placental hypoperfusion, and thus the development of PE.",

        "abstract": "PubMed is a widely used database for scientists to find biomedical-related literature. Due to the complexity of the selected research subject and its interdisciplinary nature, as well as the exponential growth in the number of disparate pieces of biomedical literature, it is an overwhelming challenge for scientists to define the right search strategies and quickly locate all related information. Specialized subsets and groupings of controlled vocabularies, such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), can enhance information retrieval in specialized domains, such as stem cell research. There is a need to develop effective search strategies and convenient solutions for knowledge organization in stem cell research. The understanding of the interrelationships between these MeSH terms also facilitates the building of knowledge organization systems in related subject fields.This study collected empirical data for MeSH-related terms from stem cell literature and developed a novel approach that uses both automation and expert-selection to create a set of terms that supports enhanced retrieval. The selected MeSH terms were reconstructed into a classified thesaurus that can guide researchers towards a successful search and knowledge organization of stem cell literature.First, 4253 MeSH terms were harvested from a sample of 5527 stem cell related research papers from the PubMed database. Next, unrelated terms were filtered out based on term frequency and specificity. Precision and recall measures were used to help identify additional valuable terms, which were mostly non-MeSH terms. The study identified 15 terms that specifically referred to stem cell research for information retrieval, which would yield a higher precision (97.7 %) and recall (94.4 %) rates in comparison to other approaches. In addition, 128 root MeSH terms were selected to conduct knowledge organization of stem cell research in categories of anatomy, disease, and others.This study presented a novel strategy and procedure to reengineer term selections of the MeSH thesaurus for literature retrieval and knowledge organization using stem cell research as a case. It could help scientists to select their own search terms and build up a thesaurus-based knowledge organization system in interested and interdisciplinary research subject areas.",

Motivated by the need to conserve energy for large-scale multi-agent systems, we propose an infrequent communication scheme that allows the system to reach average consensus at low energy consumption. The proposed scheme divides the original large network into two smaller sub-networks with some overlapping nodes. Agents in the two sub-networks take turns to broadcast and update their local estimates, until reaching consensus. We prove that the proposed scheme guarantees asymptotic convergence when both subnetworks are connected and have overlapping nodes. Simulations corroborate the energy saving capability of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "In millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, channel estimation in the presence of sparse multipath fading boils down to two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation followed by path gain estimation. To achieve super-resolution angle estimation at affordable complexity, this paper develops an efficient channel estimation approach by applying a truncated atomic norm minimization (T-ANM) technique, which is implemented via partial antenna activation during training-based channel estimation. This technique makes use of a key observation that the sparse scattering characteristics of mmWave MIMO channel gives rise to a low-rank two-level Toeplitz structure in the angular domain. Because of the low-rank property, only a subset of the transceiver antennas needs to be activated to save training resources. Meanwhile, the Toeplitz structure enables ANM-based gridless 2D DOA estimation via reduced-size semidefinite programming. Simulation results show that the proposed reduced-size method can achieve comparable spectral efficiency as the full-size benchmark method at much lower computational complexity and shorter sensing time.",

        "abstract": "This paper revisits the multi-agent average consensus problem on weight-balanced directed graphs. In order to reduce communication among the agents, many recent works have considered event-triggered communication and control as a method to reduce communication while still ensuring that the entire network converges to the desired state. One common way to do this is to design events such that a specifically chosen Lyapunov function is monotonically decreasing; however, depending on the chosen Lyapunov function the transient behaviors can be very different. Consequently, we are instead interested in considering a class of Lyapunov functions such that each Lyapunov function produces a different event-triggered coordination algorithm to solve the multi-agent average consensus problem. The proposed class of algorithms all guarantee exponential convergence of the resulting network and exclusion of Zeno behavior. This allows us to easily consider the implementation of different algorithms that all guarantee correctness to be able to meet varying performance needs. Simulations are provided to illustrate our findings.",

        "abstract": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most common prostaglandin in the human body, meaning that its malfunction impacts on the development of numerous diseases. Prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2) is involved in the synthesis of PGE2. In the present study, immunohistochemistry of PTGES2 was performed in 152 patients with endometrial cancer and in 66 patients with normal endometria. The results indicate a notable association among increased expression of PTGES2 and age (P=0.0092) and the depth of myometrial invasion (P<0.0001). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis demonstrated that cytochrome P450 17\u03b1 hydroxylase (CYP17), an enzyme for androgen synthesis, is overexpressed following PGE2 stimulation via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation. ELISA also detected increased androgen (testosterone) secretion. Further invasion of endometrial cancer cells was induced at high androgen levels and when CYP17 was overexpressed. Furthermore, the present study observed that CYP17 is overexpressed via STAT3 phosphorylation in endometrial cancer cells, which grow at a high concentration of PGE2, resulting in increased androgen secretion. Concentrations of estrogen and progesterone were not elevated, while the concentration of androgens was. Overall, a high concentration of androgens caused increased invasion of endometrial cancer cells. A high concentration of androgens, which is initiated by a high expression of PTGES2 and a high concentration of PGE2, is an important promoter of myometrial invasion in endometrial cancer.",

However, how iron overload influences hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome remains unknown. Here, the RUNX1S291fs-transduced bone marrow mononuclear cells were yielded and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice together with radioprotective bone marrow cells to generate myelodysplastic syndrome mice. Eight weeks post transplantation, the recipient mice were administered intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml iron dextran at a concentration of 25mg/ml once every other day for 8 times to establish iron overload model. At the present study, we show that iron overload impairs the frequency and colony-forming capacity of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, especially in erythroid, in myelodysplastic syndrome mice, which at least in part, due to growth differentiation factor 11 induced reactive oxygen species and shortening survival of myelodysplastic syndrome mice. Given that we are the first to construct iron overload model in myelodysplastic syndrome mice, we hope this model will be helpful for further exploring the influence and mechanism of iron overload on myelodysplastic syndrome.",

        "abstract": "The adverse effects of iron overload have raised more concerns as a growing number of studies reported its association with immune disorders. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the immune system by iron overload in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and an iron-overloaded mouse model. The peripheral blood from patients was harvested to test the effect of iron overload on the subsets of T lymphocytes, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also evaluated. The data showed that iron-overloaded patients had a lower percentage of CD3 T cells and disrupted T cell subsets, concomitant with higher ROS level in lymphocytes. In order to explore the mechanism, male C57Bl/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with iron dextran at a dose of 250\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0days for 4\u00a0weeks to establish an iron-overloaded mouse model and the blood of each mouse was collected for the analysis of the T lymphocyte subsets and T cell apoptosis. The results showed that iron overload could reduce the percentage of CD3 T cells and the ratio of Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 but increase the percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells and the ratio of CD4/CD8. We also found that iron overload induced the apoptosis of T lymphocytes and increased its ROS level. Furthermore, these effects could be partially recovered after treating with antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or iron chelator deferasirox (DFX). Taken together, these observations indicated that iron overload could selectively affect peripheral T lymphocytes and induce an impaired cellular immunity by increasing ROS level.",

Methods: Articles published between January 2005 and October 2015 that studied prevalence or influencing factors of MRSA nasal colonization in Chinese children were retrieved from Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Chinese VIP database, Chinese Wanfang database, Medline database and Ovid database. Prevalence and influencing factors were analyzed by STATA 13.1. Results: Thirteen articles were included. The overall prevalence of MRSA nasal colonization was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.027-0.062). With an MRSA prevalence of 3.9% (95% CI: 0.018-0.061) in healthy children and 5.8% (95% CI: 0.025-0.092) in children with underlying medical conditions. Children recruited in the hospitals presented MRSA prevalence of 6.4% (95% CI: 0.037-0.091), which was higher than those recruited in the communities [2.7% (95% CI: 0.012-0.043)]. A number of influencing factors for MRSA nasal colonization were noted in three eligible studies: gender (male vs female; OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55-0.82), younger age (OR: 2.98; 95% CI: 1.31-6.96 and OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.21-2.00), attending day care centers (OR: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.28-6.76), having infectious diseases (OR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.10-4.52), using antibiotics (OR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.45-5.05), residing in northern Taiwan (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.15-1.71), passive smoking (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.02-1.63), and pneumococcal vaccination (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01-1.48). Conclusions: Children could act as reservoirs of MRSA transmissions. Hospitals remained the most frequent microorganism-circulated settings. More MRSA infection control strategies are required to prevent the dissemination among children.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Background   Staphylococcus aureus  ( S. aureus ), including methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), survives in dry conditions and can persist for long periods on surfaces touched by humans. Studies that estimate the proportions and characteristics of  S. aureus  and MRSA contamination in non-hospital environments are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a proportion meta-analysis and reviewed the features of antibiotic resistance and molecular genetics.    Methods  Articles published between January 2005 and December 2015 that studied proportions of  S. aureus  and MRSA contamination in non-hospital environments were retrieved from the Medline database, Ovid database and Science Direct database. All statistics were analyzed by STATA 14.1.    Results  Twenty-nine articles were included. The overall proportions of  S. aureus  and MRSA contamination were 41.1% (95%CI 29\u201354%) and 8.6% (95%CI 5\u201313%), respectively. The proportion of MRSA contamination increased over time. From the articles, the proportion of Panton-Valentine Leukociden (PVL) genes among MRSA isolates was 54.5%, and the proportion of the  qac  gene was 100.0%. Distribution of the multilocus sequence type (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of MRSA indicated that MRSA strains were from both hospitals and communities.    Conclusion  The overall proportions of  S. aureus  and MRSA contamination in non-hospital environments were high. The outcomes of antibiotic resistance and high proportions of PVL genes indicated that the antibiotic resistance of  S. aureus  and MRSA were notable. According to the different distributions of MLST and SCC mec  of MRSA, we can infer that cross-circulation is within hospitals, communities, and livestock. The results also show that the risk from the MRSA strains was cross-transmitted among the population. High proportions of the  qac  gene of MRSA might indicate that current disinfection of MRSA has not been achieved, and it might be better to further identify the efficiency of the sterilization processes in a non-hospital environment so that relevant departments can take measures to improve disinfection of MRSA in non-hospital environments.",

During Zijingshan Station foundation pit excavation and main station structure construction, water tables, settlements and lateral deformations around the transfer section and standard section were all measured and analyzed in time, and some conclusions are drawn out, which are that (1) the water tables are controlled to be stable when artificial ground freezing was adopted and the stable changing ratios are all u003c0.7 mm/day, (2) the maximum ground settlement is not adjacent to the underground continuous walls but at the overpass bridge pier with a certain distance away from the foundation pit edge, which is seriously affected by both large traffic flows and foundation pit excavation, (3) the maximum lateral deformations of the standard section are focused at the position of about 3.0 m under the ground surface, while those of the transfer section are at about 11.0 m under the ground surface; (4) the measured and monitored items such as stable water table decreasing ratio, maximum settlements and lateral deformations all meet with the local building foundation specifications. The first subway line of Zhengzhou that contains Zijingshan Station has been put to use, the environmental effects caused by foundation pit excavation are all controlled to be stable until now, and so underground continuous walls and horizontal supports are the prior selection for the deep foundation pit in Yellow River alluvial landforms.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the MgO powders was prepared by the precipitation method with carbonate following calcination at 1200 \u00b0C, and then the obtained MgO powders was treated under the flowing gaseous mixture of steam and CO 2 . The variations of textural properties and activity for methane combustion of the MgO sample were investigated. The sample was characterized by N 2 adsorption isotherm, TEM, XRD, and TG-DTA. The results showed that the treatment temperature and the CO concentration have a significant influence on the textural properties of the MgO sample. After run at 700 \u00b0C for 24 h under the flowing gaseous mixture of steam/CO 2 /N 2 (CO 2 /N 2 = 15/85 volume ratio), the maximum pore sizes varied and the pore volumes increased obviously; and remarkably, the surface area of the MgO sample increased from 37.9 to 80.1 m 2 g \u22121 . It was proposed that during the process, the disaggregation and rearrangement of the particles have occurred, leading to the obvious variations of the textural properties of the sample. As a result, the treated MgO sample showed a higher activity for methane combustion than the original one. Keywords MgO CO 2 /H 2 O Pore size distribution Surface area Methane combustion 1 Introduction Catalytic combustion of natural gas has many advantages over the conventional flame combustion in suppressing emissions (NO x , CO) and improving energy efficiency [1] . However, the catalysts/supports with high thermal stability are needed for the high-temperature combustion of methane. MgO is an important material, which has been widely employed as catalyst support, reinforcing reagent, as well as a component in superconductors [2\u20134] . MgO has been considered as one of the most stable materials for methane combustion at high temperatures due to its high melting point. However, the significant amounts of CO 2 and steam are produced in the process of methane combustion, which would have an influence on the catalyst properties considering the intrinsic acid/base properties of CO 2 and MgO [5] . The adsorption and catalytic behaviors are usually related to their textural and surface properties of the materials. The textural properties of the materials, e.g., porosity, surface area and particle size, are the very important parameters of the catalysts/supports, and these properties are strongly dependent on the preparation [6\u201310] . However, little work has been performed to study the variations of the textural properties of the MgO sample in the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O. In this work, the variations of textural properties of the MgO sample under the flowing gaseous mixture of steam and CO 2 were investigated. This treatment was used to simulate the combustion conditions of methane, in which the significant amounts of steam and CO 2 were present. The morphology, crystal structure and textural properties of the samples were characterized by TEM, XRD, N 2 adsorption isotherm and TG-DTA. An interaction mechanism in this process was proposed, and the effect of the treatment method on the activity of methane combustion over the MgO sample was also investigated. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation and treatment of the MgO sample In this experiment, all the chemicals, including Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b7 6H 2 O (A.R.), (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 (A.R.), and Span80 (A.R. sorbitan monooleate, C 24 H 44 O 6 , MW = 428), were purchased from Beijing Chemicals Company of China and used as received. At room temperature, the MgO powder was prepared by precipitating of magnesium nitrate with ammonia carbonate in the presence of Span80. Span80 was used to refrain the particle agglomeration. If the surfactant (e.g., Span80) was not used, the MgO sample calcined at 1200 \u00b0 C for 5 h generally has lower surface areas (10\u201315 m 2 g \u22121 ), which showed a low activity for methane combustion. Typically, an amount of Span80 (0.025 mol, 11.2 g) was added to 100 mL 0.5 mol L \u22121 Mg(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Hundred milliliters of 1.0 mol L \u22121 (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 aqueous solution was added dropwise to the above solution under stirring. After stirred for another 2 h, the mixture was aged for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the solid was separated by centrifuging, and washed with water for three times. The sample was dried at 110 \u00b0 C for 24 h in an oven. The precursor was calcined at 500 \u00b0 C for 5 h to remove the surfactant, and further calcined at 1200 \u00b0 C for 5 h. The MgO sample calcined at 1200 \u00b0 C for 5 h was treated at 500 or 700 \u00b0 C for the different intervals under the gaseous mixture of steam and CO 2 . Typically, 1.0 g of MgO powder was put in a quartz reactor and run at a space velocity of 1200 h \u22121 . The gaseous mixture was obtained by passing CO 2 /N 2 (5/95 and 15/85 volume ratio) through boiling water to carry water vapor. 2.2 Characterization The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/MAX-RB X-ray powder diffractometer, using graphite monochromatized Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.154 nm), operating at 40 kV and 50 mA. The patterns were scanned from 10 \u00b0 to 70 \u00b0 (2 \u03b8 ) at a scanning rate of 5 \u00b0 min \u22121 . A nitrogen adsorption isotherm was performed at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 gas adsorption analyzer. Each sample was degassed at 200 \u00b0 C for 5 h before the measurement. Surface area and pore size distribution were calculated by BET (Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller) and BJH (Barrett\u2013Joyner\u2013Halenda) methods, respectively. The morphology of the catalyst was characterized with a JEOL model 200CX transmission electron microscope with the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The powders were dispersed in ethanol ultrasonically, and then the samples were deposited on a thin amorphous carbon film supported by copper grids. TGA-DTA was carried out with Pyris 1 TGA thermogravimeter and DTA-7 (US Perkin\u2013Elmer Co.), and the temperature rises from room temperature to 900 \u00b0 C at a rate of 10 \u00b0 C min \u22121 . 2.3 Catalytic combustion of CH 4 The combustion of CH 4 was conducted in a conventional flow system at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (0.1 g) was diluted with quartz powder (0.1 g), and loaded in a quartz reactor (i.d. 5 mm) with quartz beads packed at both ends of the catalyst bed. The thermal couple was placed in the catalyst bed to monitor the reaction temperature since CH 4 combustion is an exothermic reaction. Before each run, the catalyst was flushed with air (100 mL min \u22121 ) at 500 \u00b0 C for 1 h in order to remove adsorbed species from the surface, and then cooled to 200 \u00b0 C. A gas mixture of 1 vol% CH 4 and 20 vol% O 2 (balanced with Ar) was fed into the catalyst bed at a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 100,000 h \u22121 . The inlet and outlet gas compositions were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph with a packed column of carbon molecular sieve (1.5 m \u00d7 4 mm) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The variations of textural properties and particle sizes of the MgO samples Table 1 shows the textural properties of the original and treated MgO samples. The BET surface area of the original MgO sample (M0) is 37.9 m 2 g \u22121 . After treatment at 500 \u00b0 C for 24 h under the flowing gaseous mixture of steam/CO 2 /N 2 (CO 2 /N 2 = 5/95 volume ratio), the BET surface area (38.5 m 2 g \u22121 ) of the MgO sample (M1) did not vary, considering the analysis error range of the measure method. It is evident that the mild treatment, at a low concentration of CO 2 and a low temperature, has no significant influence on the textural properties of the MgO sample. To observe the texture variations, the MgO sample were treated under the severe conditions, i.e., by increasing CO 2 concentration and run temperature. Fig. 1 . shows the sorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the sample before and after treated at 700 \u00b0 C for 12 h under the flowing mixture gases of steam/CO 2 /N 2 (CO 2 /N 2 = 15/85 volume ratio). According to the IUPAC classification [11] , the original (M0) and the treated (M2) samples showed the similar sorption isotherms. They are both \u201ctype II\u201d isotherms with the peculiar hysteresis loops and are apparently not mesoporous ordered (type IV). Their pores seem to result from the interparticle voids in the wide size range, in line with the extremely broad pore size distribution. It is interesting that after treatment, the pore volume of M2 sample increased significantly from 0.10 to 0.13 cm 3 g \u22121 ( Fig. 1 a), and the double peaks in pore size distribution appear at 2.8 and 18 nm, respectively. Note that for M2 sample, the new pores of 18 nm generated while the pores of 2.8 nm were reduced obviously. This is much different from the single peak (2.8 nm) distribution of the original sample ( Fig. 1 b). However, the BET surface area of the MgO sample increased slightly (37.9 vs. 40.1 m 2 g \u22121 ). It seems that the severe treatment has a significant influence on the textural properties of the sample. The occurrence of the maxima at 18 nm in the pore size distribution in M2 samples is understandable. If we observe the locally enlarged isotherms, there is still a little difference in these isotherms. We could assume that after being attached by steam and CO 2 , the agglomerated secondary particles may have disaggregated and further rearranged to form the smaller particles and some smaller particles may have grown into larger ones. As a result, the maximum pores of 18 nm may be generated from the voids among these secondary particles. The maximum pores at 2.8 nm may result from the interstices among the primary particles (i.e., within the secondary particles), and the maximum pores at 18 nm may result from the interstices among the small secondary particles. Further, the original MgO sample was processed with the mixture gases of steam/CO 2 /N 2 (CO 2 /N 2 = 15/85, volume ratio) at 700 \u00b0 C for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the N 2 adsorption isotherms on the MgO sample (M3) exhibit a classical type IV adsorption isotherm with a H 2 -hysteresis loop, according to the IUPAC classification [11] , which indicates the crossed pores with narrow necks and wide bodies (often referred to as \u2018inkbottle\u2019 model mesopores) were formed. The isotherms of M3 are clearly different from those of the original sample (M0). Interestingly, although the pore size distribution of M3 is still wide, their pore sizes are clearly different from those of the original sample (M0). Compared with the original sample (M0), the new mesopores with 3.9 nm maximum are generated, accompanied by the decrease of the large pores (>30 nm) but the slight increase of the partial micropores (<1.5 nm). The increase of micropores may be the migration of Mg with steam, although we could not give the direct proof limited by our experiment conditions. We could assume that in the presence of steam and CO 2 , the migration of Mg ions with steam would occur, and the migration of Mg from the surface of MgO crystal would lead to the generation of new micropores in the remained particles. This could be supported by the coarseness of the grain surface on base of the TEM micrographs in Fig. 3 (in the next part). Therefore, the micropores increased. This may also favor for the increase of the BET area, which has been observed in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . On the other hand, the migrated Mg would form new grains and/or aggregate into the secondary particles. Furthermore, the disaggregated grains by the mixture gases further rearranged to form the new interstice. As a result, the maximum of pore size distribution shifts to 3.9 nm and the pore size distribution also becomes narrower slightly, which is much different from that (wide, centered at 2.8 nm) of the M0 sample ( Fig. 2 b). Most importantly, after treatment for 24 h, the surface area of the MgO sample (M3) increased greatly to 80.1 m 2 g \u22121 , which is much higher than that (37.9 m 2 g \u22121 ) of the original sample (M0) (shown in Table 1 ). The increase of the surface area of the MgO sample may be ascribed as to the generation of the new mesopores, as well as the increase of micropores. The particle morphologies of the original and the treated MgO samples were observed with TEM ( Fig. 3 ). Before treatment, the original MgO particles (M0) agglomerated severely, and the particle size was large with a wide size distribution (from 100 nm to several microns) ( Fig. 3 a). After treatment at 700 \u00b0 C for 12 h under the flowing mixture gases of steam/CO 2 /N 2 (CO 2 /N 2 = 15/85, volume ratio), the agglomeration of the particles was alleviated to some extent. As shown in Fig. 3 b (the arrow indicated), some particles disaggregated and their surface became coarse clearly, although the morphology variations of most of the particles can not be discerned clearly. This may be due to the short treatment duration. As the time of treatment was elongated to 24 h, the agglomeration of the particles was relieved clearly, and their particle sizes became much smaller (50\u2013100 nm) than those of the original sample ( Fig. 3 c). It is evident that such a treatment has also an obvious influence on the particle size. 3.2 The proposed interaction mechanism From the results above, it has been found clearly that after treatment, the BET area of M3 sample increased about one time and the pore volume increased, compared with the original sample (M0). Although the pore size distribution is still wide, the maximum of pore size distribution has shifted to larger by the treatment. This firmly demonstrated that the treatment has a significant influence on the texture properties of the sample. To understand this process, TG-DTA was performed to investigate the thermal properties of the carbonate precursor after being dried at 100 \u00b0 C. Observed from Fig. 4 , three peaks of weight loss can be found in TG curve. Firstly, a slight weight loss (5 wt%) in the rang of from 50 to 250 \u00b0 C was caused by the dehydration and dehydroxylation, which is accompanied by a slight endothermic peak in DTA curve. Secondly, a large weight loss (35 wt%) between 250 and 500 \u00b0 C was caused by the combustion of the Span80 surfactant and the dehydroxylation, in which the former process is largely exothermic and but the latter is slightly endothermic; as a result, a large exothermic peak in DTA curve could be observed. Lastly, above 500 \u00b0 C, there is a slight weight loss in TG curve due to the decomposition of carbonate, accompanied by an obvious endothermic peak in DTA curve. This suggests that carbonate decomposed completely into MgO at 750 \u00b0 C. Therefore, the treatment with the gaseous mixture was carried out at 700 \u00b0 C. The crystal structures of the original and treated samples were further characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 5 , all the samples crystallized perfectly with a cubic structure (JCPDS 4-0829), and no any other crystal phases (e.g. Mg (OH) 2 and MgCO 3 ) can be observed. The XRD results demonstrated that such treatment has no obvious influence on the MgO crystal structure. Supported by TEM micrographs, nevertheless, the treatments resulted in a decrease of the particle size and a significant increase in the surface area. The results calculated by Scherrer equation showed that the crystal sizes of M0, M2 and M3 are 25.5, 25.5 and 20.1 nm, respectively. Comparing M3 with M0, it seems that the crystals became smaller, although no obvious variation for M2 . Besides, the contrast experiment showed that if only steam was used to treat the sample, the MgO sample sintered severely and its surface area has decreased to 27.1 m 2 g \u22121 . It is well known that the presence of steam can accelerated the sintering of the particles. These results indicate that an underlying interaction mechanism may have been present in the process. It is well known that the acid treatment of clays and natural silicates has long been studied with the intention of modifying the texture and acidity [12\u201321] . It has been reported that the surface of clay minerals can be modified through appropriate acid treatment, which leads to an increase in the surface area and/or in the number of acid centers. The surfaces of many metal oxides exhibit both Lewis base and/or Lewis acid character. These solid acid/base properties are particularly strong at corner/edge sites [22] . Residual surface hydroxyls and cation/anion vacancies can also add to the rich surface reactivities. Considering the base surface of MgO crystals and the acidic properties of CO 2 in the presence of steam [5] , it could be tentatively assumed that the interaction processes may have taken place under the treatment conditions. In the presence of CO 2 and steam, the surface of the MgO particle was attacked by steam and CO 2 . It seems that the instant \u201cMgCO 3 \u201d intermediate may be metastable since the \u201cMgCO 3 \u201d intermediate could not be present for a long duration at 700 \u00b0C (the temperature of carbonate decomposition), and it may decompose quickly into the MgO crystals. This process is described as the dynamic balance reaction below: (1) H 2 O ( g ) + CO 2 ( g ) + MgO \u2194 \u201c MgCO 3 \u201d + H 2 O ( g ) \u2194 MgO + CO 2 ( g ) + H 2 O ( g ) Indeed, on base of the TG-DTA results above, it is possible that there is a dynamic balance between the surface reaction and the decomposition in the presence of CO 2 and steam at 700 \u00b0 C. Under the conditions, it could be assumed that the former process may be much slow and the latter may be much fast, and the small MgO grains were formed. MgO belong to a perfect cubic crystal. During the process, we assumed that attached by CO 2 and steam, several factors should be involved in this process: First, the surfaces of MgO grains would become coarse, which could contribute to the increase of its BET surface area. Second, the process is complicate. It is understandable that some large secondary particles would redisperse or disaggregate. As a result, the primary particles would rearrange to form the new secondary particles. The 3.9 nm (and 2.8 nm) pores may result from the interstices within secondary particles, which contributes to the increase of the BET area and the variations of the pore size of the sample. Third, the Mg on the surface of the sample would migrate with the steam, and formed small grains or grew into large ones. Moreover, the migration of Mg from the grain surface, some micropores would generate, resulting in the increase of micropores. All these may also favor for the increase of the BET area and the variations of pore size. The sketched diagram of the restructured particles is shown in Fig. 6 . 3.3 Catalytic combustion of methane The catalytic properties of the MgO sample may be affected by the textural properties and the particle sizes. The combustion of methane was conducted over the MgO samples. The light-off curves for methane combustion are shown in Fig. 7 . After treatment, the ignition temperature ( T 10 ) and the complete combustion temperature ( T 90 ) over the M3 sample were 690 and 790 \u00b0 C, but those over the original one (M0) were 710 and 830 \u00b0 C, respectively. Both MgO samples showed the higher activities than the quartz bead ( T 10 = 850 \u00b0C, T 90 = 880 \u00b0C), which could be attributed to their higher surface areas (37.9 and 80.1 m 2 g \u22121 ) than that (3.1 m 2 g \u22121 ) of the quartz bead. It is well known that at low conversions of methane, methane combustion is mainly controlled by surface catalytic reaction [23] . The adsorption of the reacting gases may have a significant influence on the catalyst activity. After treatment, the MgO sample with large surface area may favor for the adsorption of the reactants, which promoted the surface reaction. Importantly, the T 90 difference (40 \u00b0 C) of both MgO samples was much lager than their T 10 difference (20 \u00b0 C). It is well known that at high conversions of methane, the oxidation of methane usually includes surface reaction and free radical reaction [23] . The free radical reactions are more dependent on mass transfer than on the surface reaction. Before the gases reacted on the solid surface, the gas diffusion from bulk gases to the solid surface occurred. Because the surface reaction is relative fast, the influence of mass transfer from gas bulk to the catalyst surface on the reaction should not be ignored. The surface reaction and mass transfer may be affected by various factors, e.g., intrinsic activity, particle sizes, porosity and concentration of catalyst [23] . Considering the non-variable valence of Mg ions, the intrinsic activity of MgO is very low, t he influence of textural properties of the MgO sample on the mass transfer process may be more significant than on the surface reaction. The large surface area of the catalyst is beneficial to mass transfer, since the large surface area may favor for the adsorption of more gases on the solid surface. As a result, the T 90 difference (40 \u00b0 C) of the both MgO samples was much lager than their T 10 difference (20 \u00b0 C). 4 Conclusions By treatment under the flowing gaseous mixture of steam and CO 2 , the surface area of the MgO sample can be increased significantly, the maximum of pore size distribution varied and the pore volume increased. The variations of textural properties were mainly ascribed to the disaggregation and rearrangement of the MgO particles. As a result, the MgO sample after treatment showed a higher activity than the original one. This treatment method may be also used to regenerate or investigate the other catalysts/supports.

        "abstract": "Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most malignant human cancers. In this study, we intended to explore the molecular functional of microRNA-127 (miR-127) in regulating pancreatic cancer development both in vitro and in vivo. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate endogenous miR-127 expression in in vitro pancreatic cancer cell lines and in vivo clinical samples of pancreatic carcinoma. Lentiviral technology was applied to overexpress miR-127 in capan-1 and PANC-1 cells. Pancreatic cancer proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and invasion were assessed in vitro, and capan-1-derived tumorigenicity was evaluated in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and qRT-PCR were performed to assess the downstream target gene of miR-127 in pancreatic cancer, human Bcl-2-associated athanogene 5 (BAG5). BAG5 was subsequently upregulated in miR-127-overexpressed capan-1 and PANC-1 cells to evaluate its effect on pancreatic cancer progression. MiR-127 was preferentially downregulated in both pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and human pancreatic tumors. In lentivirus-infected capan-1 and PANC-1 cells, miR-127 overexpression significantly inhibited cancer progression, cell-cycle transition and invasion in vitro, as well as tumorigenicity in vivo. Human BAG5 was confirmed to be the downstream target of miR-127 in pancreatic cancer. Forced overexpression of BAG5 in capan-1 and PANC-1 cells reversed the tumor-suppressing effect of miR-127 on cancer development. MiR-127 is downregulated and acting as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic carcinoma. The functional regulation of miR-127 in pancreatic carcinoma is very likely through the inverse correlation of its downstream target gene of BAG5.",

Finally, RGC apoptosis and the mitochondrial-apoptosis pathway-related protein cleaved caspase-3 were detected using a Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and western blotting, respectively. : mtDNA damage was observed as early as 48 h after the exposure of RGCs to HP. At 120 h after HP, mtDNA damage and mutations significantly increased, reaching >40% and 4.8 \u00b1 0.3-fold, respectively, compared with the control values. Twelve hours after HP, the expressions of OGG1, MYH and POLG mRNA in the RGCs were obviously increased 5.02 \u00b1 0.6-fold ( < 0.01), 4.3 \u00b1 0.2-fold ( < 0.05), and 0.8 \u00b1 0.09-fold ( < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of the three enzymes decreased at 72 and 120 h after HP ( < 0.05). After interference with POLG-shRNA, the mtDNA damage and mutations were significantly increased ( < 0.01), while complex I/III activities gradually decreased ( < 0.05). Corresponding decreases in membrane potential and ATP production appeared at 5 and 6 days after POLG-shRNA transfection respectively ( < 0.05).
