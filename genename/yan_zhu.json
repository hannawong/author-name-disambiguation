        "abstract": "The dynamic interfacial tensions (IFTs) of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) surfactant/polymer systems against n-decane have been investigated using a spinning drop interfacial tensiometer in this paper. Two anionic–nonionic surfactants with different hydrophilic groups, C8PO6EO3S (6-3) and C8PO6EO6S (6-6), were selected as model surfactants. Partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide (HMPAM) were employed. The influences of surfactant concentration, temperature, polymer concentration, and oleic acid in the oil on IFTs have been studied. The experimental results show that anionic–nonionic surfactants can form compact adsorption films and reach ultralow IFT (10−3 mN/m) under optimum conditions. The addition of polymer has great influence on dynamic IFTs between surfactant solutions and n-decane mainly by the formation of looser mixed films resulting from the penetration of polymer chains into the interface. The compact surfactant film will also be weakened by the comp...",

        "abstract": "POEMS (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, M protein, and Skin changes) syndrome is a complicated and rare disease. Systematic research on computed tomography (CT) imaging characteristics in POEMS syndrome is scanty. The role of CT in diagnosis needs to be assessed.To retrospectively analyze the CT imaging features in 24 patients with POEMS syndrome and evaluate the role of CT in diagnosis of this disease.Twenty-four patients with confirmed POEMS syndrome were included in the study. Chest and abdominal CT images were analyzed.The three minor diagnostic criteria for POEMS syndrome (extravascular volume overload, organomegaly, and bone lesions) can be detected effectively by CT. Extravascular volume overload involved multiple serous cavities: hydrothorax, hydropericardium, and ascites, which were found in 79.2%, 41.7%, and 54.2% patients, respectively. The volume of effusion was small to moderate. Organomegaly involved multiorgans: hepatomegaly was found in 45.8% patients, splenomegaly in 54.2%, and lymphadenopathy in 75% patients. Hepatospleen exhibited moderate homogeneous enlargement without local enhanced signal after injection of contrast material. Bone lesions were classified into three groups: osteosclerotic, osteolytic, and mixed lesions. Osteosclerotic lesions, taking multiple, scattered, and variably sized high-density plaque-like appearance, were found in 20.8% patients. Osteolytic lesions, exhibiting punched-out low-density image, were found in 4.2% patients. Mixed ones, holding both common characteristics of them, were detected in 8.3% patients. These CT abnormalities disappeared after effective treatment.CT plays vital role in the confirmation of the three minor diagnostic criteria for POEMS syndrome: extravascular volume overload, organomegaly, and bone lesions.",

        "abstract": "Carbon (C) content and nitrogen (N) content ratio of leaf is a key index of carbon and nitrogen metabolic status, thus it is important for precision diagnosis and management of plant growth and yield formation. In order to study the feasibility of estimating the ratio of C and N contents of rice leaves with properties of canopy reflectance spectra, two field experiments were conducted with different nitrogen levels and rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) in two years. Then the relationships of C/N ratio of leaf to reflectance of single bands, different vegetation indices, derivative indices and parameters normalized by the continuum were analyzed comprehensively. The results showed that there was consistent correlation between C/N ratio and canopy reflectance after rice jointing stage. The C/N ratio of leaf was positively correlated to reflectance at 350~742 nm, and negatively correlated at 750~1143 nm, while highly correlated to eight spectral parameters among all cultivars and growth stages. After comparing the R 2 and SE of regression equations, the spectral index of ND 672 was found to be the best parameter for predicting C/N ratio of leaf in rice. The derived equation was tested with the observed data of all growth stages in the field experiment. The estimation precision ranged 0.687~0.986, estimation accuracy 0.907~1.126, and RMSE 7.851~18.25, indicating a good fit between the predicted and observed values of C/N ratio of leaf. Tests with other independent dataset showed that the estimation precision was 0.857~0.967, estimation accuracy 0.970~1.049, and RMSE 7.07~16.01. It was concluded that the present hyperspectral model was feasible and reliable for estimating C/N ratio of rice leaf with different cultivars and nitrogen levels.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model that predicts the definite adverse events following chemotherapy in patients with hematological malignancies (HMs).This is a retrospective cohort study including 1157 cases with HMs. Firstly, we screened and verified the independent risk factors associated with post-chemotherapy adverse events by both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis using 70 % of randomly selected cases (training set). Secondly, we proposed a mathematical model based on those selected factors. The calibration and discrimination of the model were assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, respectively. Lastly, the predicative power of this model was further tested in the remaining 30 % of cases (validation set).Our statistical analysis indicated that liver dysfunction (OR = 2.164), active infection (OR = 3.619), coagulation abnormalities (OR = 4.614), intensity of chemotherapy (OR = 10.001), acute leukemia (OR = 2.185), and obesity (OR = 1.604) were independent risk factors for post-chemotherapy adverse events in HM patients (all P < 0.05). Based on the verified risk factors, a predictive model was proposed. This model had good discrimination and calibration. When 0.648 was selected as the cutoff point, the sensitivity and specificity of this predictive model in validation sets was 72.7 and 87.4 %, respectively. Furthermore, this proposed model's positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and consistency rate were 87.3, 73.0 and 80.0 %, respectively.Our study indicated that this six risk factor-based mathematical model is accurate and sufficient enough to predict definite post-chemotherapy adverse events in a HM patient and it may aid clinicians to optimize treatment for a HM patient.",

We present a new scheme of Revocation-based broadcast encryption (RBBE) which is designed on Dan Boneh \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">et al.</italic>\n's scheme with the designation mechanism proposed in 2005. We combine two above-mentioned schemes into a new cryptosystem, called Dual-mode broadcast encryption (DMBE). Based on these work, we reach the following conclusions. We use the DMBE scheme as an example to show that it is feasible to construct a broadcast encryption scheme that supports designation and revocation mechanisms simultaneously. The cryptosystem with dual modes is more e.cient than that with single mode over computational costs, and the performance is improved to at most O(⌈N/2⌉), where N is the total number of users in the system. We prove completely that both the RBBE scheme and the DMBE scheme are semantically secure against chosen plaintext attack with full collusion under the decisional bilinear Di.e-Hellman exponent assumption.",

        "abstract": "Honeydew is excreted by aphids as a sweet waste and nectar is floral honey. Honeydew and nectar are complicated samples which consist of various sugars and amino acids. In this work, a simple ion chromatography with column-switching method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of 8 monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in honeydew and nectar. A reversed-phase column was used as a pretreatment column to eliminate organics on-line and sugars were eluted from a collection loop to analytical column by using column-switching technique. This method showed good linearity (r⩾0.9994) and afforded low limits of detection ranging from 1.55 to 10.17μgL(-1) for all the analytes. Recoveries ranged from 95% to 105% and repeatability results were acceptable with relative standard deviation of less than 3.21% (n=6). This method was successfully applied to quantification of these sugars in honeydew and nectar. These results showed honeydew had much more oligosaccharides than nectar.",

        "abstract": "The soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio reflects the coordination degree of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism. Precise and real-time monitoring of soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio is of significant importance for nitrogen diagnosis and management regulation in wheat production. In this study, time-course near infrared spectroscopy and soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio of fresh and dry leaves were obtained under different field experiments with varied years and cultivar and N rates. The methods of partial least squares (PLS), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and wavelet neural network (WNN) were used to develop the calibration models with the preprocessed spectra, respectively, and the dataset selected randomly was used to evaluate the constructed models. The results showed that the performance of the models for fresh-leaves was not satisfied, but good for dry-leaves with the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) by PLS, BPNN and WNN models based on 1655-2378 nm less than 0.3% and with the coefficients of determination (R2) over than 0.9, respectively. In comparison, the model based on WNN was the best one. All these indicated that near infrared spectrometry could be applied to estimating the soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio in plant. The results provided the theoretical basis and technological approach for diagnosing crop C/N.",

Methods: An incision was made at the left uterus of rabbit approaching vagina and the IUD (TCu380A, high dose group; TCu 220C, low dose group and without Cu-IUD, control group) was pushed into uterine cavity, which was fixed on the uterus wall. At the different time points after implantation, the serumal copper ion concentration was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and the pharmacokinetics parameter values werecalculated in order to reflect copper ion absorption and metabolism regularity. Results: The serumal copper ion concentrations were kept at a low and stable levels in the TC220C and TCu380A groups, at the same time, local uterine fluid copper ion concentrations remained in high level. There were no differences in serumal copper ion concentration among these three groups(P>0.05). Conclusion: The serumal copper ion concentrations were kept at a low and stable levels in all groups.",

        "abstract": "It is very important for using nondestructive method to determine nitrogen status and growth characters of crop plants.Three experiments were carried out in Nanjing to investigate the quantitative relationship of leaf nitrogen accumulation to canopy reflectance spectra in wheat.Experiment one was conducted with two cultivars(Xuzhou 26 and Huaimai 18) and four nitrogen application levels of 0,120,210 and 300 kg·ha~(-1) in 2001.Experiment two was designed for one cultivar(Yangmai 10),with three nitrogen application levels of 0,150 and 300 kg·ha~(-1) in 2002.Experiment three included four cultivars(Xuzhou 26,Huaimai 20,Ningmai 9 and Yangmai 10) with five nitrogen application levels of 0,75,150,225 and 300 kg·ha~(-1) in 2003.On the basis of characterized protein content of these five cultivars,Xuzhou 26 and Ningmai 9 were considered as high and low protein types,respectively,and the other three cultivars were thought to be medium-protein type.The results showed that the nitrogen accumulation in wheat leaves increased with increasing nitrogen application.For the different cultivar types with low, medium and high grain protein contents,the correlations were higher for leaf nitrogen accumulation per unit soil area to canopy reflectance spectra.The ratios of several bands in near infrared to visible light were linearly related to leaf nitrogen accumulation,and thus the ratio index of the average reflectance at 760,810,870,950 and 1 100 nm to 660 nm was used for quantitative monitoring of leaf nitrogen accumulation in the different cultivar types,but different cultivar types had different regression coefficients.The above dynamic relationships of leaf nitrogen accumulation to canopy reflectance spectra were feasible for different cultivars,growing stages and nitrogen levels in wheat.These results provide a theoretical basis and technical approach for monitoring of plant nitrogen status and precision management of nitrogen fertilization in wheat production.",

The mobile phase was methanol-water (40/60, v/v) for a C18 reversed-phase column and 3 mM of methanesulfonic acid (pH 2.5) for a cation-exchange column, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the 14 organic explosives and the five inorganic cations were separated and detected simultaneously within 45 min. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) of the 14 organic explosives and the five inorganic cations were in the range of 0.0048-0.0333 mg/L and 0.0116-0.1851 mg/L, respectively. The linear correlation coefficients were 0.9971-0.9999, and the relative standard deviation of the retention time and the peak area were 0.02-0.31% and 0.51-3.64%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Recently, many enterprises have moved their data into the cloud by using file syncing and sharing (FSS) services, which have been deployed for mobile users. However, Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) solutions for increasingly deployed mobile devices have also in fact raised a new challenge for how to prevent users from abusing the FSS service. In this paper, we address this issue by using a new system model involving anomaly detection, tracing, and revocation approaches. The presented solution applies a new threshold public key based cryptosystem, called partially-ordered hierarchical encryption (PHE), which implements a partial-order key hierarchy and it is similar to role hierarchy widely used in RBAC. PHE provides two main security mechanisms, i.e., traitor tracing and key revocation, which can greatly improve the efficiency compared to previous approaches. The security and performance analysis shows that PHE is a provably secure threshold encryption and provides following salient management and performance benefits: it can promise to efficiently trace all possible traitor coalitions and support public revocation not only for the users but for the specified groups.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a deterministic algorithm named Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF), an algorithm significantly improved from the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), was used to integrate remotely sensed information (ASD spectral data, HJ-1 A/B CCD and Landsat-5 TM data) with a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth model (WheatGrow). The analyzed values of model variables, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), were calculated based on EnSRF without perturbed measurements. Independent datasets were used to test EnSRF and the root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.81 and 0.82 g m-2, with relative error (RE) values of 0.15 and 0.13, for LAI and LNA, respectively. RMSE values for LAI and LNA were 1.39 and 1.70 g m-2, respectively (RE, 0.28 and 0.34) based on EnKF, 1.17 and 1.80 g m-2 (RE, 0.24 and 0.35), respectively, based on the WheatGrow model alone, and 0.97 and 1.25 g m-2 (RE, 0.21 and 0.24), respectively, based on the remote sensing models. These results indicated that the LAI and LNA values based on EnSRF matched the measured values well compared with the EnKF, WheatGrow and remote sensing models. In addition, the predicted results are consistent with the temporal and spatial distribution of winter wheat growth status and grain yields in the study area, with RE values of less than 0.2 and 0.1 for LAI and LNA, respectively. These results provide an important approach for simulating winter wheat growth status based on combining remote sensing and crop growth models.",

        "abstract": "A rapid, simple and generic analytical method which was able to simultaneously determine 220 undesirable chemical residues in infant formula had been developed. The method comprised of extraction with acetonitrile, clean-up by low temperature and water precipitation, and analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS-MS) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Most fat materials in acetonitrile extract were eliminated by low temperature clean-up. The water precipitation, providing a necessary and supplementary cleanup, could avoid losses of hydrophobic analytes (avermectins, ionophores). Average recoveries for spiked infant formula were in the range from 57% to 147% with associated RSD values between 1% and 28%. For over 80% of the analytes, the recoveries were between 70% and 120% with RSD values in the range of 1-15%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were from 0.01 to 5 μg/kg, which were usually sufficient to verify the compliance of products with legal tolerances. Application of this method in routine monitoring programs would imply a drastic reduction of both effort and time.",

        "abstract": "Taking two rice cultivars (Liangyoupeijiu and Wuxiangjing 14) with different plant types as test materials, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to study the relationships of rice canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception and light use efficiency to grain yield under three planting densities and five nitrogen (N) application rates. From tillering to maturing stage, the average PAR reflectance in all treatments was 3.45%. The ratio of reflected PAR to the total loss of PAR from tillering to heading stage was 10.90%, which was significanlty lower than that (22.06%) from heading to maturiting stage. The PAR conversion efficiency from tillering to maturing stage decreased with increasing planting density but increased with increasing nitrogen rate, and the conversion efficiency was significantly higher from tillering to heading than from heading to maturing stage. The PAR use efficiency from tillering to maturing stage increased with the increase of planting density and nitrogen application rate, and the average PAR use efficiency of Liangyoupeijiu (1.83 g·MJ-1) was significantly higher than that of Wuxiangjing 14 (1.42 g·MJ-1). Due to the longer growth period of Wuxiangjing 14, its incident PAR and intercepted PAR under midium and high planting densities were higher, as compared with Liangyoupeijiu. The grain yield was significantly positively correlated with the canopy PAR interceptance and use efficiency at different growth stages, but less correlated with the PAR conversion efficiency. To increase the canopy PAR use efficiency and conversion efficiency on the basis of maintaining higher PAR interception rate could be an effective way to increase rice yield.",

Carbon nanosorbents, i.e., magnetic modified carboxyl-graphene (Mag-CG) and magnetic modified carboxyl-carbon nanotubes (Mag-CCNTs), have been synthesised and evaluated in PRiME pass-through cleanup procedure for human plasma prior to analysis of 10 selected local anesthetic drugs by liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The matrix effect, an interesting phenomenon of ion suppression for local anesthetic drugs containing ester group and ion enhancement for other drugs containing acylamino group, has been minimized using carbon nanosorbents PRiME pass-through cleanup procedure. Under the optimal conditions, the obtained results show higher cleanup efficiency of the carbon nanosorbents with recoveries between 70.2% and 126%. Furthermore, the carbon nanosorbents are also evaluated for reuse up to 80-100 times. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for local anesthetic drugs are in the range of 0.024-0.15 μg/L.

GO covered nZVI was self-assembled by electrostatic forces by varying the pH. Several important parameters affecting the MSPE procedure have been investigated. The pH value is a key factor in the whole MSPE process. An appropriate pH can not only improve adsorption and desorption efficiency, but also enable the extraction of TCs from GO/nZVI by using deionized water. Optimal conditions were then used for the extraction of TCs from real samples, prior to HPLC-MS/MS determination in the positive ESI mode of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column. The proposed method achieved low limits of quantitation in the range of 8.05–83.19 ng L−1 and 17.42–182.75 ng L−1 for water and milk samples, respectively, and satisfactory recoveries in the range of 84.2–105.5% with intra-day RSD in the range of 0.6–2.5% and inter-day RSD in the range of 1.2–9.2% for the spiked water sample and from 87.0% to 101.8% with intra-day RSD in the range of 1.1–5.4% and inter-day RSD in the range of 2.0–9.7% for the spiked milk sample.",

The results showed that with increasing nitrogen application rate, wheat LAI and its canopy reflectance at near infrared (760 to approximately 1220 nm) increased, whereas the reflectance at visible band (460 to approximately 710 nm) decreased. From jointing to maturity, the LAI and the reflectance of short bands in near infrared increased initially and decreased then, whereas the reflectance of visible light and long bands in near infrared was in adverse, with the lowest value appeared at booting stage. Wheat LAI was negatively correlated with the reflectance of visible light, but positively with that of short bands in near infrared, with the highest correlation coefficient at 810 nm. It was proposed that wheat LAI could be well monitored by vegetation indices RVI (810, 510) and DVI (810, 560). PVI and TSAVI were proved to be the spectral indices in monitoring wheat LAI, and higher accuracy was obtained with combined RVI (810, 510), DVI (810, 560) and PVI.",

        "abstract": "Potassium, nitrogen and their interaction play important roles in plant growth, development and yield of rice. Appropriate potassium can stimulate nitrogen accumulation and translocation in rice. In order to identify plant nitrogen absorption, distribution and utilization characteristics of rice under potassium supply, a field experiment was conducted with four potassium rates (0, 90, 180, 270 kg ha-1 K2O) using conventional japonica cultivars (Wuyunjing 7 and Wuxiangjing 14) and hybrid japonica cultivars (86 you 8, Siyou 422) from 2004 to 2005 on Experimental Farm of Nanjing Agricultural University, Jiangsu province, China. Potassium application increased rice yield (4.56?14.77%) and nitrogen accumulation during growth stages, with the maximum from elongation stage to heading stage, but nitrogen uptake ratio decreased. Potassium application enhanced nitrogen transport amount and percentage after anthesis, as well as nitrogen accumulation in different rice organs, nitrogen distribution percentage in leaves and panicles, whereas declined nitrogen distribution percentage in culm and sheath. Nitrogen absorption from fertilizer, basic nitrogen recovery efficiency before elongation stage, nitrogen recovery efficiency during the whole growing stage, and nitrogen harvest index were raised significantly, but plant nitrogen productivity was opposite. Grain yield, nitrogen accumula- tion, nitrogen translocation amount and percentage after anthesis, and nitrogen distribution in different rice organs amounted to the maximum at K2O application rate of 180 kg ha-1, as well as nitrogen absorption from fertilizer, basic nitrogen recovery efficiency before elongation stage, nitrogen recovery efficiency during the whole growing stage. However, nitrogen absorption percentage from elongation stage to heading stage, nitrogen distribution percentage in culm and sheath, plant nitrogen productivity decreased to the minimum. The yield and nitrogen recovery efficiency of conventional japonica cultivars were higher than those of hybrid japonica cultivars.",

This paper aimed to develop a 3D morphological model of wheat root system based on the parameters of wheat root morphological features, and to realize the visualization of wheat root growth. According to the framework of visualization technology for wheat root growth, a 3D visualization model of wheat root axis, including root axis growth model, branch geometric model, and root axis curve model, was developed firstly. Then, by integrating root topology, the corresponding pixel was determined, and the whole wheat root system was three-dimensionally re-constructed by using the morphological feature parameters in the root morphological model. Finally, based on the platform of OpenGL, and by integrating the technologies of texture mapping, lighting rendering, and collision detection, the 3D visualization of wheat root growth was realized. The 3D output of wheat root system from the model was vivid, which could realize the 3D root system visualization of different wheat cultivars under different water regimes and nitrogen application rates. This study could lay a technical foundation for further development of an integral visualization system of wheat plant.",

        "abstract": "By the method of statistics, this paper approached the quantitative relationships between leaf total nitrogen concentration (LNC) and canopy reflectance spectra of rice, based on the data from 5-year field experiments involving different varieties and nitrogen fertilization rates. The results showed that the LNC had higher correlations with the key spectral parameters of two bands than of single band. The relative, differential, and normalized difference vegetation indices (RVI, DVI, NDVI) of the bands in near infrared (760-1,220 nm) and visible light 510 nm, 560 nm, 680 nm and 710 nm all showed significantly positive correlations to LNC, and NDVI showed the best. All the parameters having significant correlations with LNC were selected to compare the R2 and SE in the regression equations with LNC, which confirmed that the NDVI of R1220 and R710 was the best parameter for predicting the LNC. The quantitative equation LNC = 3.2708 x NDVI (1220, 710) + 0.8654 was tested by the data from other three field experiments with different rice cultivars, water conditions and nitrogen fertilization rates, and the estimated R2, slope, and RMSE were ranged in 0.674-0.862, 0.908-1.010 and 11.315%-19.491%, respectively, indicating a good fit between the predicted and observed values of LNCs, which suggested that this model was feasible for predicting the LNC of rice under different cultivation conditions.",

        "abstract": "A method was established for determination of potential anti-osteoporosis ingredients from Liuwei Dihuang Decoction by osteoblast cell membrane chromatography/ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CMC/UPLC-TOF/MS). The osteoblasts were used as the source of cell membrane for the preparation of CMC stationary phase. An osteoblast CMC column (10 mm×2 mm) was prepared by coating silica gel (0.05 g) with cell membrane. The active ingredients in the aqueous extract of Liuwei Dihuang Decoction (90 g/L) were first screened by CMC. Water was used as the mobile phase, and the flow rate was 0.20 mL/min. Then, the eluates of the CMC were qualitatively analyzed by UPLC-TOF/MS using a WATERS ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (10 mm×2 mm). Acetonitrile-water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.40 mL/min. This method could quickly and selectively identify 16 potential anti-osteoporotic active ingredients from Liuwei Dihuang Decoction. Due to high catalpol content in Liuwei Dihuang Decoction and its good affinity with CMC column, catapol was selected for in vivo and in vitro pharmacological examinations. It was found that catalpol (1-10 μmol/L) could significantly promote the proliferation of osteoblasts in a dose-dependent manner. It also significantly increased the area of bone staining in osteoporosis zebrafish model. The osteoblast CMC/UPLC-TOF/MS method could quickly screen the anti-osteoporosis active ingredients in complex traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, and had the advantages of simple operation, high efficiency and high sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the effects of nitroglycerine (NTG), Verapamil(VP), papaverine(PA) and the mixed solution of Verapamil and nitroglycerine (VG) on relaxing function of human radial arteries. Methods The radial arteries of thirty patients were used during the operation of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A short segment (1.0-1.5cm) of radial arteris were taken from the distal end of radial arteries of each patient and were cut into vascular rings, which were mounted in the organ bath chamber and then subject to a series of tests for vascular smooth muscle viability and endothelial integrity. The effects of five storage solutions on the relaxing function were evaluated by \"Organ-Bath\" technique. The five solutions included: (1) Ringer' s solution (control group); (2) VP solution (VP group); (3) NTG solution (NTG group); (4) PA solution (PA group); (5) VG solution (VG group). First, challenged with phenylephrine (10-5mol/L), vasorelaxant effect of these drugs (effect onset and efficacy) was observed at different time point and resting tension was recorded. Second, after 30min pre-incubation with either verapamil, papaverine, phenoxybenzamine or VG mixture, potassium chloride (final concentration of 60mmol/L) was added in the organ bath chamber and then vasoconstriction was observed subsequently. Finally, after 30-min pretreatment of different antispasmodic agent in the same way as described above, the vascular rings were mounted in organ bath chamber and challenged with phenylephrine(10-5mol/L). Vascular spasticity and vosospasm duration were observed at different time point which might provide guidance for optimal timing of clinical application. Results The radial arteries in VG, VP, NTG and PA solutions were relaxed in 11 min after vasospasm and there was no difference between them ( P>0.05). But during the initial three minutes,the relaxation effect of VG and NTG was significantly better than other two groups. Relaxation curve showed that the ability of vasodilatation of VG, NTG, VP and PA decreased in order. In the experiment about antivasospasm pretreatment of radial arteries, there was no difference between VG and VP group ( P>0.05 ), whose effects were better than NTG and PA group( P<0.05 ). After cold storage for 24h, VG and VP still could prevent vasospasm. But NTG and PA hardly had any function and there was no difference compared with the control group ( P>0.05 ). Conclusion Although in the final all these drugs could prevent and relieve vasospasm of radial arteries in the different level, it appeared that a combination of verapamil and nitroglycenn is more fit for treating radial artery during CABG operation than other drugs.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effect of Chinese herb compound naoyikang on the mRNA expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice model of Alzheimer disease. METHODS: (1)The experiment was conducted in the Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nantong University from October 2004 to March 2005. (2)The mice models of Alzheimer disease were established by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactosamine and natrium nitrosum. 120 ICR mice were randomly divided into normal control group, model control group, naofukang control group (0.4 g/kg per day), and low, middle and high dose naofukang groups (2.4, 7.2, 24 g/kg per day). Naoyikang was composed of shouwu, bajitian and so on (produced by the Pharmaceutical Room of Nantong Hospital of Chinese Medicine,1.98 g crude drug in per g granule). The model control group and all the treated groups were intraperitoneally injected with 10 g/L D-galactosamine 120 mg/kg per day and 10 g/L natrium nitrosum 90 mg/kg per day for 60 days; the normal control group was injected with normal saline at the same dosage. Naoyikang and naofukang prepared with 5 g/L sodium carboxymethycellulose were intragastrically infused for 60 days. (3)Six mice in each group were randomly selected to take the brain tissues. The mRNA expression of NGF and BDNF were tested by RT-PCR. RESULTS: (1)Compared with the control group, the expression of NGF mRNA in low, middle and high doses naofukang groups had no significant difference [(1.05±0.25), (0.83±0.46), (0.99±0.46), (1.12±0.22), P > 0.05]; Compared with the control group, the expression of BDNF mRNA in low, middle and high doses naofukang groups had no significant difference [(0.73±0.20), (0.49±0.12), (0.63±0.15), (0.32±0.22), P > 0.05]. (2)The expressions of NGF and BDNF mRNA of the model group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group [NGF mRNA (1.98±0.60), (1.12±0.22); BDNF mRNA (1.32±0.37), (0.32±0.22), P < 0.05]. (3)Compared with the model group, the expressions of NGF and BDNF mRNA in the naofukang control group and low, middle and high doses naofukang groups were obviously decreased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Naoyikang can improve part mechanism of learning and memory ability of mice with Alzheimer disease by protecting cholinergic neurons and improving the reversal transportation of NGF and BDNF.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Sucralose is widely used in food and beverages as sweetener. Current synthesis approaches typically provide sucralose products with varying levels of related chlorinated carbohydrates which can affect the taste and flavor-modifying properties of sucralose. Quantification of related compounds in sucralose is often hampered by the lack of commercially available standards. In this work, nine related compounds were purified (purity u003e 97%) and identified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), then a rapid and simple HPLC coupled with evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of sucralose and related compounds. Under optimized conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 2–600 μg mL −1  with determination coefficients  R  2  ⩾ 0.9990. Moreover, low limits of detection in the range of 0.5–2.0 μg mL −1  and good repeatability (RSD  n  = 6) were obtained. Recoveries were from 96.8% to 101.2%. Finally, the method has been successfully applied to sucralose quality control and purification process monitoring.",

        "abstract": "With the method of planting cotton by stages at the sites from Yangtze valley to north Xinjiang, this paper studied the effects of air temperature and sunlight on cotton fiber quality in 2002 approximately 2003. The results showed that with increasing latitude, fiber length increased, while micronaire value and soluble sugar content (SSC) decreased. An ecological model describing the relationships of fiber strength, micronaire value and SSC with air temperature and sunlight was built to determine the optimal range and critical value of air temperature during boll development period. If a high quality fiber (length > or = 27 mm) was targeted, the daily mean temperature (DMT) and minimum temperature (Tmin) during this period should be 21.3 approximately 29.7 and 10.7 approximately 21.3 degrees C, respectively, and the daily temperature difference (DTD) should not be > 15.2 degrees C. Fiber length was the longest when the DMT was 25.4 degrees C. If the lowest fiber length was > or = 25 mm, DMT and Tmin should not be lower than 15.5 and 10.7 degrees C, respectively, and DTD should not be over 17.9 degrees C during boll development period.",

        "abstract": "Based on the field experiments with different plant-type wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars and varied population densities, the time-course changes in the angle between stem and sheath (stem-sheath angle) on main stem were observed, and a process-based model was developed for simulating the growth dynamics of stem-sheath angle on the main stem by using system analysis method and dynamic modeling technology. The stem-sheath angle increased with the growth of corresponding leaves, and decreased with increasing population density. The maximum stem-sheath angle decreased with increasing leaf position, except for the first leaf on main stem. The growth dynamics of stem-sheath angle could be described with Logistic equation, and the changes in the maximum stem-sheath angle with leaf position could be quantified with two different equations. The maximal value of stem-sheath angle at the second leaf position was considered as the cultivar parameter to reflect the genetic differences, and the plant number per unit area was used to quantify the effects of population density. The independent field experiment dataset of different wheat cultivars was used to test the model, and the average RMSE between estimated and observed values was 1.7 degrees, suggesting that the present model had good performance and reliability on predicting the growth dynamics of wheat stem-sheath angle, and provided a key module for wheat plant-type simulation and visualization.",

The entire synthesis was achieved in water without damage to the monodispersity of CNSs. The water-dispersibility of CNSs was significantly increased after QAP-modification. The QAP-grafted CNSs (QAP-CNSs) were characterized by FTIR, XPS, SEM, TGA, and zeta potential measurement. The functionalization methodology was further extended to produce octadecylamine-modified CNSs, which demonstrated its versatility in preparation of functional carbons. For application in AEC, the QAP-CNSs were adhered on sulfonated poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) microspheres by electrostatic interaction. Using the PS-DVB/QAP...",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to quantify the relationship between plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) and canopy spectral reflectance at early growth stages in rice,and provide a technical support for decision making on nitrogen dressing management. Based on seven field experiments with different rice cultivars and nitrogen rates in five different growing seasons,the canopy spectral reflectance during the stages of tillering and elongation were measured with three different canopy spectral sensors (Fieldspec FR 2500,MSR-16 and GreenSeeker RT 100),and the plants were sampled for PNA measurement simultaneously. Then the relationships beween PNA and vegetation indices were analyzed. The results showed that some vegetation indices were closely related to PNA,but there were significant differences among the estimation models based on different canopy sensors. For the hyperspectral sensor (Fieldspec FR 2500),DVI(760,740) had a good performance on model development,with determination coefficient (R2) of 0.79,but the performance of model testing was poor,with R2 and RMSE of 0.15 and 2.11 g/m2,respectively. For the multispectral sensor (MSR-16),DVI(760,710) could be used for PNA estimation,with R2 of 0.94 for model development,and with R2 and RMSE of 0.94 and 0.76 g/m2 for model testing,respectively. NDVI(770,660) from the active spectral sensor (RT 100) gave the best estimation of PNA,with R2 of 0.97 for model development,and with R2 and RMSE of 0.97 and 0.62 g/m2 for model testing,respectively. These results would be helpful for selection of proper spectral sensors in PNA monitoring during early growth stages of rice.",

        "abstract": "In this work, polypropylene (PP)/polystyrene (PS) blends with different organoclay concentrations were prepared via melt compounding.\n Differing from the results of previous reports, the organoclay platelets are mostly located in the dispersed PS phase instead\n of the interface. The dimensions of the dispersed PS droplets are greatly reduced and apparent compatibilization effect still\n exists, which cannot be explained by the traditional compatibilization mechanism. A novel compatibilization mechanism, “cutting”\n to apparently compatibilize the immiscible PP/PS blends was proposed. The organoclay platelets tend to form a special “knife-like\n structure” in the PS domain under the shear stress of the continuous PP phase during compounding. The “clay knife” can split\n the dispersed PS domain apart and lead to the dramatic reduction of the dispersed domain size.",

        "abstract": "The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around the histone octamer constituted by two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Nucleosome assembly/disassembly/reassembly processes occur primarily during DNA replication and also during transcription, DNA repair and recombination. Several chromatin-remodeling factors had been previously shown to have pleiotropic roles in different processes of plant growth and development. We have recently demonstrated that the Arabidopsis NRP1 and NRP2 genes encode H2A/H2B chaperones and are required for the maintenance of post-embryonic root growth. The nrp1-1nrp2-1 double mutant plants specifically showed a short-root phenotype in normal growth conditions. They were also hypersensitive to DNA damage and showed release of transcriptional gene silencing. We propose that NRP1 and NRP2 act as histone H2A/H2B chaperones in nucleosome assembly, playing critical roles for a correct genome transcription in the maintenance of root growth.",

Methods: The model of endometriosis was established by Autotransplantion, the animals were divided randomly into 5 groups:\" Caulis Sargentodoxae Formula \" high dose group (80 g/kg , Group A), low dose group (20 g/kg, Group B) and danazol group (60 mg/kg, group C), castrate dose group (group D), control group (group E). After continuous treatment for 21 d, the level of E2, aromatase in ectopic endometrium and ovary were detected for each group, the volume of the ectopic endometrium was also measured. Results: The growth of endometrium was obviously inhibited in group A, C and D. The inhibitory rates were not significantly different between these groups (P>0.05), but were significantly different compared with group E (P<0.05). Observation from the morphology features showed that implanted endometrial become degenerating. The level of E2 was not significantly different between group A, C and group D, but were significantly different compared with group E (P<0.05). And also there was a significantly decrease in the expression of aromatase of ectopic endometrium and ovary in group A, C and D (P>0.05), however, there was a significant difference between group A and group E (P<0.05). Conclusion:\" Caulis Sargentodoxae Formula\"can hold-back the expression of aromatase in ectopic endometrium and ovary so as to decrease the level of E2, it can inhibit the growth of the ectopic endometrium.",

A Dionex CS12 column was used with gradient elution from an initial eluent of 5% CH3CN+35 mM H2SO4 to 27% CH3CN+35 mM H2SO4 (at 35 min). Detection limits in the range 2.6-22.6 microg/l were observed for all analytes except m-nitroaniline, for which the detection limit was 201 microg/l. Linear calibrations and good precision were observed and the method was applied to the determination of benzidine, p-chloroaniline and 1-naphthylamine in wastewater samples. Further, the separation was also used (after some modification of the eluent conditions) for the determination of 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate (2,4- and 2,6-TDI) and 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI) after their hydrolysis to 2,4-TDA, 2,6-TDA and 4,4'-DDP.

The estimation accuracy for LNA was in the sequence of simulated pixel spectra > pure pixel spectra > measured pixel spectra. However, the LNA monitoring model based on simulated pixel spectra couldn't be extrapolated directly to spatial level. The results of model verification also indicated that the monitoring model based on pure pixel spectra performed well in two different wheat ecological zones. Therefore, the pure pixel spectrum extraction method could be applied to other varied and remotely sensed data with different spatial and spectral resolutions by making use of the merits of ground- and space- remote sensing simultaneously, which provided a technological basis for estimating winter wheat nitrogen status in regional scale.",

Using this technique, the four compounds were detected simultaneously in a short time with strongly retained compounds (2-KDG and 5-KDG) eluted out prior to weakly retained compounds (glucose and DGA). Under the optimized conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 0.01-20 mg L(-1) with determination coefficients (R(2))≥ 99.84%. Low detection limits (LODs) in the range of 0.87-2.59 μg L(-1) and good repeatability (RSD<3%, n=6) were obtained. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of the four compounds in the fermentation broth, in which Gluconobacter oxydans was used to produce gluconic acids from glucose.",

The correlation sequence of SOM to different index types was DI>RI>ND which composed of spectral reflectance or the first derivative spectra. DI composed of first derivative of 554 nm and 1 398 nm gave a better prediction performance, with equation as y=184.2×exp[-1297×DI(D554, D1398)], coefficient of determination was 0.90. Testing of the monitoring models with independent data from different soil types indicated that R2, RMSE and RPD of validation were 0.84, 3.64 and 2.98, respectively. In addition, the scores computed by PLS were applied as input of BP neural network developed with over 99.56% of cumulative proportion of correlation matrix. R2 of calibration model was 0.98, and R2, RMSE, RPD of validation were 0.96, 2.24 and 4.83, respectively. Compared with BP neural network model, DI(D554, D1398) had a little lower prediction precision, but it could meet need of estimating of SOM content. 【Conclusion】 It is concluded that both of methods based on DI(D554, D1398) and BP neural network can estimate SOM content accurately.",

Methods FB-DLKP was performed on 21 eyes of 21 patients with fungal corneal ulcer. The follow- ing factors were observed,procedure of operation, best-corrected visual acuity and refractive states at the end of follow- up, postoperative complications and corneal ulcer recurrence. Results FB-DLKP was finished successfully on 21 eyes of 21 patients,but micro-perforation of descemet's membrane occurred in 8 eyes(38. 10% ) of 21 eyes in operation. And no obvious dual-chamber existed after operation. At the end of follow-up, the average best-corrected visual acuity was 0. 58, spherical equivalent degree was( -2. 15 ±2.42)DS,and astigmatism was( -3.23 ±1.75)DS. No corneal rejection and ulcer recurrence appeared during the follow-up. Conclusion FB-DLKP is worth applying widely in fungal corneal ulcer with advantages such as low quality corneal materials,non-penetrating of antior chamber,low rejection rate and good op- eration results.",

Comparison and intercalibration of spectral reflectance and vegetation indices derived from different sensors are important for multi-sensor data fusion and utilization. In this study, the spectral reflectance and its derived vegetation indices from three ground-based sensors (ASD Field Spec Pro spectrometer, CropScan MSR 16 and GreenSeeker RT 100) in six winter wheat field experiments were compared. Then, the best sensor (ASD) and its normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI (807, 736)) for estimating above-ground plant N uptake were determined (R2 of 0.885 and RMSE of 1.440 g·N·m(-2) for model calibration). In order to better utilize the spectral reflectance from the three sensors, intercalibration models for vegetation indices based on different sensors were developed. The results indicated that the vegetation indices from different sensors could be intercalibrated, which should promote application of data fusion and make monitoring of above-ground plant N uptake more precise and accurate.",

        "abstract": "To study the efficacy of allogeneic hemotopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for hematological malignancy.A total of 104 patients with hematological malignancy, who underwent allo-HSCT in Xiangya Hospital from December 1999 to January 2010, were retrospectively analyzed. Of the patients, the transplantation related mortality (TRM), relapse rate (RR), 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The unfavorable prognostic factors were also statistically examined.Hematopoietic reconstitution was achieved in 101 patients. At the last data of follow-up, the incidences of severe acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and extensive chronic GVHD were 15.38% and 25.53%, and the TRM and RR were 15.66% and 21.76%, respectively. The estimated 5-year OS and DFS for all patients were (73.49±4.59)% and (63.10±5.32)%, respectively. Those for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were (63.00±9.51)% and (49.30±9.96)%, and those for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients were (83.87±5.06)% and (74.55±6.79)%, respectively. The survival analysis suggested the poor prognostic factors for allo-HSCT recipients including female sex, severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy. Further multivariate analyses revealed that severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy were the independent risk factors of poor prognosis for the recipients (P<0.05). The 5-year DFS of severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy patients was (48.22±12.69)% and (42.09±12.31)%, respectively. The TRM of severe aGVHD, HLA-mismatched graft and unrelated donor transplant was significantly higher than that of the corresponding control groups (57.14% vs. 4.81%, 33.33% vs. 10.41%, 26.09% vs. 9.28%; P<0.05). The RR of refractory hematological malignancy was significantly higher than that of the control group (41.09% vs. 15.63%, P<0.05).The treatment of allo-HSCT can improve the disease free survival of patients with hematological malignany and is an important therapeutic method for hematological malignancy. Severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy are the independent risk factors of poor prognosis for the allo-HSCT recipients with hematological malignancy.",

In this work, a green, rapid, and effective analytical method based on supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) has been proposed for the simultaneous determination of the eight PAE plasticizers in sports beverage samples. They are dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dipropyl phthalate (DPRP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dipentyl phthalate (DPP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and di--octyl phthalate (DNOP). Liquid phase extraction (LPE) was employed to extract the PAE plasticizers before testing using SFC with ultraviolet (UV) detection. SFC parameters, including stationary phase screening, modifier composition and volume percentage, column temperature, flow rate, and backpressure, were optimized. Under the optimum conditions, all the eight PAE plasticizers could be determined simultaneously by SFC within 6 min at 225 nm. The optimized eluent was supercritical CO with 3% (v/v) methanol. The performance of the developed method was also evaluated. The eight PAE plasticizers exhibited satisfactory linearities with correlation coefficients () of 0.9991-0.9997 in the range of 0.05-25 mg/L. The limits of detection ranged from 7.5 to 15 μg/L (=3, =3). Recoveries of all the PAE plasticizers for the spiked samples ranged from 91.7%-100.2% with relative standard deviations of no more than 6.5% (=3). This method is green, time-saving, simple, selective, robust, and convenient for the analysis of the eight PAE plasticizers in real sports beverage samples.",

Then, the sperm motility and morphology of the rats were detected by computer-assisted sperm analysis, the serum levels of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) measured by ELISA, changes in the tight junction of epididymal cells observed under the transmission electron microscope, the protein and gene expressions of Claudin1 and β-catenin determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and the conception rate of the mated female rats calculated.Dutasteride significantly suppressed the serum DHT level, sperm motility, and fertility of the rats (P <0.05). Interspaces between epididymal epithelial cell tight junctions were observed, the volume of epididymal fluid obviously increased, and the expressions of Claudin1 and β-catenin gene and protein remarkably downregulated in the experimental rats (P <0.05).Dutasteride can significantly inhibit the fertility of male rats by reducing the serum DHT level, suppressing Claudin1 and β-catenin expressions, and damaging epididymal epithelial cell junctions.",

Therefore, an anion suppressor and ion-exclusion column were adopted to achieve on-line matrix elimination of weak acid anions with high concentration for the analysis of trace inorganic anions in weak acid salts. A series of standard solutions consisting of target anions of various concentrations from 0.005 to 10 mg/L were analyzed, with correlation coefficients r ≥ 0.9990. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.67 to 1.51 μg/L, based on the signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a 25 μL injection volume. Relative standard deviations for retention time, peak area, and peak height were all less than 2.01%. A spiking study was performed with satisfactory recoveries between 90.3 and 104.4% for all anions. The chromatographic system was successfully applied to the analysis of trace inorganic anions in five weak acid salts.",

The K562 cells were co-cultured in direct contact with MSC, while the control cells were just cultured alone. Bortezomib was administered at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L. Cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry with Annexin-V/PI double staining kit. The VCAM-1 gene expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results indicated that bortezomib could induce apoptosis of K562 cells in a time-dependent manner. K562 cells growing on the layer of MSC demonstrated the similar sensitivity to apoptosis induction of bortezomib. K562 cells which did not express VCAM-1 originally were induced to express VCAM-1 mRNA when co-cultured with MSC. This effect could be abrogated by bortezomib treatment. Furthermore, bortezomib significantly downregulated the VCAM-1 expression of MSC. It is concluded that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can induce apoptosis of K562 cells even though in presence of the MSC layer.",

With UV detection, iodate exhibited satisfactory linearity in the range of 0.1-10.0 mg/L with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996.

With 15 mM methanesulfonic acid as the mobile phase, the separations of a mixture of inorganic cations (Li(+), Na(+), NH(4)(+), K(+)) was tested by using a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C(4)D) and a low impedance C(4)D (LIC(4)D). The LIC(4)D is the series combination of a C(4)D and a quartz crystal resonator. At the resonant frequency of the series combination, the capacitor impedance from capillary wall was offset by the inductance impedance from the quartz crystal resonator. A minimum impedance was obtained in the impedance-frequency curve of the combination. The responses of the C(4)D and LIC(4)D were analyzed based on an equivalent circuit model. It was shown that the sensitivity of the C(4)D to the change in analyte concentration is rather poor due to the high ratio of the impedance from the capillary wall capacitor to the solution impedance. The LIC(4)D has the similar sensitivity as a contact conductivity detector but a much smaller cell volume. The on-column detection model was realized by LiC(4)D without preparation of optical detection window in monolithic column.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Recent researches suggested that the abnormalities of bone marrow microenvironment have important implications for the genesis and evolution of multiple myeloma.However,the gene expression profile(GEP)changes in the interaction between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell(MSC) and myeloma cells are not reported.Methods:To investigate the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma,cDNA microarray was employed to investigate the GEP of MSC before and after interacting with myeloma cells.And the genes with differential expression MSC co-cultured with myeloma cells(the MC groups)or cultured alone to continue after the removal of MM cells(MA groups)compared with the control groups(the MK groups)were screened by scanning and analyzed by computer software.Results:After co-cultured of MSC with MM cells(the MC groups),among total 10 000 genes,we filtered a total of 837 differential representing genes(837/10 000,8.37%),of which there were 472 up-regulated genes(472/837,56.39%)and 365 genes were down-regulated(365/837,43.61%).We found 367 differentially expressed genes in the MA groups compared to the control ones, including 218 up-regulated genes(218/367,59.40%)and 149 down-regulated genes(149/367,40.60%).Then we selected eight genes(MMP-1,FGFR2,ANGPTL4,MFAP5,TGM2,STC1,CCL7 and IL-32)from differential genes to verify by real-time quantitative PCR and their functions were explored.The Real-time quantitative PCR results were consistent with cDNA microarray results.Conclusion: It is indicated that myeloma cells induce a variety of gene expression changes of normal bone marrow MSC,and some changes still exist even after the removal of MM cells.In addition,among the eight selected genes in this study,seven of them have not been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma.",

The model included 4 submodels: panicle axis curve, panicle axis geometry, primary and secondary branch geometry, and spikelet geometry submodels. Bezier curves were used to simulate dynamics of the panicle axis curve, panicle axis geometry submodel was developed by mapping panicle axis curve to 3D, primary and secondary branch geometry submodel was developed with a part of panicle axis and a cylinder, spikelet geometry submodel was developed by a ellipsoid and a cylinder. Based on topographic structure of rice panicle, the rice panicle geometrical model was developed. The main parameters of the model were the length of panicle, the angle of panicle-neck, the length and number of primary and secondary branches, the grain size and so on. 【Result】 Based on the geometrical model for rice panicle and the platform of OpenGL, the dynamic growth processes of three-dimensional morphological structure of rice panicle was realized on the computer. 【Conclusion】 Rice panicle visualization could lay a foundation for development of visual growth system in rice and be used for reference to the visualization of other crops.",

Results showed that adding 0. 5 % cerium helped to improve the corrosion resistance of the aluminizing coatingin strong aqueous acids, saline water, and tap water. The additionof 0.5% cerium and 1.0% Magnesium further contributed to improve the corrosion resistance of the aluminizing coating in diifferent fluids.

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α agonist fenobibrate on the secretion of endothelium-derived ontracting factors in hypertensive rats. Methods: The changes of vascular tension in SHR rats after having been incubated with 0.1 , 1.0, or 10.0 μmol/L fenobibrate or 10.0 μmol/L fenobibrate and PPARα antagonist MK866 or PPARγ antagonist GW9662 for one hour were observed, and the findings were compared with those in WKY rats (control group). The serum levels of vascular endothelial contraction factor prostacyclin (PGF) 1α, 2α, and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of COX-1 protein was determined by Western blot analysis. Results: Compared with the control group, fenobibrate significantly reduced the vasoconstriction ability of the SHR rats (P = 0.013). PPARα antagonist MK866 significantly improved the vascular contractility of SHR rats that had been incubated with 10.0 μmol/L fenobibrate (P = 0.021). PPARγ antagonist GW9662 had no significant effect on the vascular contractility of SHR rats after having been incubated with 10.0 μmol/L fenobibrate (P = 0.071). The serum levels of PGF1α (P = 0.014), 2α (P=0.023), and TXB2 (P = 0.017) in SHR rats incubated with 10.0 μmol/L fenobibrate were significantly lower than in the control group. With the presence of vascular endothelium, the expression of COX-1 in SHR rats incubated with fenobibrate was significantly lower than that in SHR rats incubated without fenobibrate (P = 0.027). Conclusion: Fenobibrate reduces the secretion of endothelium-dependent contracting factors in SHR rats through lowering the expression of COX-1.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, afforestation shifted from land suitable for afforestation to the harsh sites asks for a higher quality of seedlings to overcome the environment stress. It is essential to review the late decade abroad advances in intensive container seedlings culture for applying the techniques to forest restoration in stressful sites in China. This paper summarized current techniques such as exponential fertilization, fall fertilization, subirrigation, short-day treatments and hot-planting, root pruning, container size, as well as cold storage and thawing. Exponential fertilization has been approved to be more effective because fertilizer is raised progressively to match exponential growth and nutrient demand. Fall fertilization, applied in autumn, can avoid growth dilution of nutrients, which has been successfully applied in many tree species. Plants with subirrigation grow at least as well as their cohorts with overhead irrigation, besides, subirrigation needs less water inputs, and less nitrogen leaching. Field performance of a seedling can be improved by stopping shoot growth in summer with the seedling exposed to short-day treatments, by which the root system growth can be enhanced. Freezer storage of conifer seedlings has become a standard operating procedure for many commercial nurseries, because freezing converts all the free water to ice in the storage container, and thus the development of pathogenic fungi is retarded. This paper prospected future study trends on techniques to promote seedling quality.",

        "abstract": "Chromatin structure requires proper modulation in face of transcriptional reprogramming in the context of organism growth and development. Chromatin-remodeling factors and histone chaperones are considered to intrinsically possess abilities to remodel chromatin structure in single or in combination. Our previous study revealed the functional synergy between the Arabidopsis chromatin-remodeling factor INOSITOL AUXOTROPHY 80 (AtINO80) and the histone chaperone NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN 1 (NRP1) and NRP2 in somatic homologous recombination, one crucial pathway involved in repairing DNA double strand breaks. Here, we report genetic interplay between  and  in regulating inflorescence meristem (IM) and root apical meristem (RAM) activities. The triple mutant  depleting of both AtINO80 () and NRP1/2 () showed abnormal positioning pattern of floral primordia and enlargement of IM size. Higher mRNA levels of several genes involved in auxin pathway (e.g., , ) were found in the inflorescences of the triple mutant but barely in those of the single mutant  or the double mutant . In particular, the depletion of AtINO80 and NRP1/2 decreased histone H3 levels within the chromatin regions of , which encodes an important auxin efflux carrier. Moreover, the triple mutant displayed a severe short-root phenotype with higher sensitivity to auxin transport inhibitor NPA. Unusual high level of cell death was also found in triple mutant root tips, accompanied by double-strand break damages revealed by γ-H2A.X loci and cortex cell enlargement. Collectively, our study provides novel insight into the functional coordination of the two epigenetic factors AtINO80 and NRP1/2 in apical meristems during plant growth and development.",

Capillary monolithic columns for liquid chromatography were also prepared by embedding CNTs in polymer monolithic columns. Columns with CNTs have the unique advantages in the separation of aromatic compounds for the tr electron system of CNTs.

The factors for method optimization included sample preparation, matrix effects and the instrument parameters of each online component. Scatter plot was introduced in this study to directly illustrate the results of the condition optimization and matrix effects in the online system. For most of the pesticides, the average recoveries ranged from 70 to 130% and the RSD were below 15%.

MWCNTs were easily quaternized with a defined number of bonded layers and desirable positive charge by a multi-step synthesis, using methylamine and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether as monomers to build a branching polymer that has quaternary ammonium groups. PS-DVB beads were sulfonated by sulfuric acid to provide opposite charge, which had electrostatic interaction with quaternized MWCNTs. Functionalization of MWCNTs was characterized by techniques that include Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The dispersion of MWCNTs in deionized water was enhanced after the grafting of cationic polyelectrolytes on them, which was in agreement with the positive charge at any pH value. With the PS-DVB/MWCNT composite beads as anion exchange phase and potassium hydroxide solutions as eluent, the common inorganic anions were well separated with high stability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that the optinal conditions were pH 5.0, 40 min of extraction time, 60 mL of aqueous phase and no added salt, respectively. The enrichment factor of [C 4mim] [PF 6] for phenol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-nitrophenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol and bisphenol A were compared with 1-octanol. Under the optimal conditions, the enrichment factor of ionic liquid for the five phenols were in the range of 9-151. The detection limits of phenol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-nitrophenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol and bisphenol A were 2.0, 0.9, 0.3, 1.8 and 1.1 μg/L (S/N =3), respectively.

        "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitously found in the environment and have been proved to be prospectively associated with the risk of cancer. In this study, a simple method based on pipette-tip solid phase extraction (PT-SPE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been firstly developed for the determination of 16 PAHs in human whole blood. Three-dimensional ionic liquid-ferrite functionalized graphene oxide nanocomposite (3D-IL-FeO-GO) was used as sorbent in PT-SPE. Compared with conventional SPE method, the PT-SPE method was solvent-saving (1.0 mL), reusable (at least 10 times) and required less blood sample (200 μL). Affecting parameters on extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, a good linearity was obtained and the recoveries of 16 PAHs at three spiked levels ranged from 85.0% to 115%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 0.007-0.013 μg/L. Furthermore, the developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 16 PAHs in 14 human blood samples. The results showed that the predominant PAHs in human whole blood was low-molecular-weight PAHs, with the rank order phenanthrene (PHE)> naphthalene (NAP)> fluorene (FLU)> fluoranthene (FLT)> pyrene (PYR). Because of its simplicity, accuracy and reliability, the PT-SPE method combined with GC-MS demonstrated the applicability for clinical analysis and provided more information for PAHs exposure studies.",

        "abstract": "After the terminal bud is set, the seedling biomass can still accumulate substantially and accordingly the nutrient concentration in the seedling declines in the fall. The dilution caused by biomass increase could be relieved by fall fertilization. Abroad, fall fertilization is widely applied for culturing many evergreen tree seedlings such as Picea abies, Picea mariana, Pinus taeda, Pinus elliottii, Pinus resinosa, Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Eucalyptus globulus. However in China, just a few studies are referred to fall fertilization with the seedlings of Platycladus orientalis and triploid Populus tomentosa. In this paper, many aspects in the recent studies were reviewed, including the of the morphological and physiological mechanism happened in the seedlings regulated by fall fertilization, field performance of the seedling conducted by fall fertilization, as well as the system of the fall fertilization. Translocation of nutrients was specifically analyzed about how to regulate the seedling quality at nursery and subsequent field performance after the seedlings were applied fertilization in the fall. Differences were further discussed between the seedlings of evergreen and deciduous trees with fertilization in the autumn. Based on the aspects, the future in the study was prospected.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, we employed untargeted metabolomics to investigate the synergistic killing mechanism of polymyxin B in combination with an aminoglycoside, amikacin against a polymyxin-susceptible isolate  FADDI-PA111 (MICs = 2 mg/L for both polymyxin B and amikacin) and a polymyxin-resistant Liverpool Epidemic Strain LESB58 (the corresponding MIC for both polymyxin B and amikacin is 16 mg/L ). The metabolites were extracted at 15 min, 1 and 4 h following treatment with polymyxin B alone (2 mg/L for FADDI-PA111; 4 mg/L for LESB58), amikacin alone (2 mg/L) and in combination; and analyzed using LC-MS. At 15 min and 1 h, polymyxin B alone induced significant perturbations in glycerophospholipid and fatty acid metabolism pathways in FADDI-PA111, and to a lesser extent in LESB58. Amikacin alone at 1 and 4 h induced significant perturbations in peptide and amino acid metabolism, which is in line with the mode of action of aminoglycosides. Pathway analysis of FADDI-PA111 revealed that the synergistic effect of the combination was largely due to the inhibition of cell envelope biogenesis which was initially driven by polymyxin B via suppression of key metabolites involved in lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and membrane lipids (15 min and 1 h) and later by amikacin (4 h). Overall, these novel findings demonstrate that the disruption of the cell envelope biogenesis, central carbohydrate metabolism, decreased levels of amino sugars and a downregulated nucleotide pool are the metabolic pathways associated with the synergistic killing of polymyxin-amikacin combination against  This mechanistic study might help optimizing synergistic polymyxin B combinations in the clinical setting.",

While budding yeast contains a single NAP1 gene, multicellular organisms, including plants and animals, contain several NAP1 and NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN (NRP) genes. However, the biological role of these genes has been largely unexamined. Here, we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, simultaneous knockout of the two NRP genes, NRP1 and NRP2, impaired postembryonic root growth. In the nrp1-1 nrp2-1 double mutant, arrest of cell cycle progression at G2/M and disordered cellular organization occurred in root tips. The mutant seedlings exhibit perturbed expression of approximately 100 genes, including some genes involved in root proliferation and patterning. The mutant plants are highly sensitive to genotoxic stress and show increased levels of DNA damage and the release of transcriptional gene silencing. NRP1 and NRP2 are localized in the nucleus and can form homomeric and heteromeric protein complexes. Both proteins specifically bind histones H2A and H2B and associate with chromatin in vivo. We propose that NRP1 and NRP2 act as H2A/H2B chaperones in the maintenance of dynamic chromatin in epigenetic inheritance.",

METHODS: The prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells were treated with epristeride for 3 d or 7 d. Cell morphology was observed under phase-contrast microscope, cell viability was detected by trypan blue method. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometer, the expressions of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Bcl-2 protein were detected by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Epristeride inhibited the growth of human prostatic cancer LNCaP cells with the inhibition rate of 40.0%, 47.4% and 54.3% when exposed to 5, 15 and 45 μmol·L-1 epristeride for 7 d, respectively. The epristeride in the three concentrations induced apoptosis in the LNCaP cells with the apoptosis rate of 3.5%, 15.8% and 25.0%, respectively, and the apoptosis rate in the control group was 2.2%. The epristeride dose-dependently decreased the expression of PSA and Bcl-2 protein in the LNCaP cells. CONCLUSION: Epristeride is able to inhibit the growth and the expression of PSA and Bcl-2 protein of human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP, thus inducing apoptosis in LNCaP cells in the three concentrations in vitro.",

        "abstract": "A novel Cu nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide-chitosan (CuNPs/r-GO-chitosan) composite film modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated by dispersing CuNPs uniformly on a stable r-GO-chitosan thin film through electrodeposition process. The modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and exhibited efficiently electrocatalytic oxidation toward monosaccharides with high stability. The good electrocatalytic activity of this modified electrode might be attributed to the synergistic effect of r-GO and CuNPs, and the stability might be attributed to the r-GO and chitosan thin matrix film. When the CuNPs/r-GO-chitosan/GCE was used as an electrochemical sensor in high performance anion exchange chromatography-direct current amperometric detection (HPAEC-DC) flowing system for the determination of monosaccharides under constant working potential of +0.55 V, the detection limits (S/N=3) ranged from 0.006 to 0.02 mg L(-1) for the analyzed sugars, and the dynamic linear ranges spanned from 0.02 to 500 mg L(-1). The proposed method has been applied for the determination of monosaccharide composition of crude polysaccharides from phellinus igniarius real samples, and the results were satisfactory.",

Methods: Rats were continually treated with acetazolamide for consecutive 10 days. Each male rat was paired with 2 female rats. The reproductive indices including: copulation index, pregnancy index and fertility index were calculated.Sperm motility and morphology were analyzed by computer-assisted sperm analysis system. The concentration of serum T and DHT were detected by ELISA, and the weights of testis and epididymis were determined by electronic balance, then the morphology of tissue and histochemistry analysis of testis and epdidymis were done by HE staining and electron microscope. Results: After treatment with acetazolamide, the sperm motilityall decreased in variant-dose-group and the abnormal spermatozoa rate increased, then the pregnancy indices also decreased. But there were no differences in serum T and DHT level between acetazolamide treated male and control males. The histology of testis and epididymis was also unaffected by treatment. Conclusion: Acetazolamide can interfere with epididymal sperm maturation, hamperfertilization, but no influence on testis and reproductive endocrine.",

As well as systematically introduced the measuring principle,five functional modules of the system were introduced. They were high-frequency modulated light source module,first-level amplifier circuit module of the photoelectric cell response,high-pass filter module,second-level amplifier circuit module and signal extraction module. Theoretical analysis and derivation on the design of the two key parts,the first-level amplifier circuit module and the signal extraction module,were provided. Furthermore,the self-developed experimental equipment was used to measure the reflection spectrum in wheat field. The experimental results showed that the impact from passive light source on the measuring results was almost completely filtered,while the response caused by active light source was detected efficiently. Experimental results were stable and had a small fluctuation ratio of less than 4. 97% during experiments.",

This developed analytical method involved a rapid sample extraction by modified and miniaturized quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method followed by isocratic ion chromatographic separation of nitenpyram and 6-chloronicotinic acid into an IonPac AS11-HC column protected by IonPac AG11A guard column by running 30 mM NaOH + 10% acetonitrile mobile phase. A homemade post-column photochemical reactor was also integrated with the ion chromatographic system for online transformation of both analytes into their respective highly fluorescent photoproduct in basic media without using an extra pump. The developed method was validated by following SANTE/11945/2015 guidelines on analytical quality control and validation procedures. The method showed a good linear response (r > 0.999), improved limit of detection (0.101 - 0.132 μg/L), minimum or no matrix effect, excellent recoveries (90.2 - 100.10%) and relative standard deviations (RSDs) were found to be ≤ 6.50%.

Unfortunately, polymyxin resistance in  has been increasingly reported. The present study was designed to define metabolic differences between paired polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant  strains using untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses. The metabolomes of wild-type PAK (polymyxin B MIC 1 mg/L) and its paired  mutant strains, PAK and PAK (polymyxin B MICs 16 mg/L and 64 mg/L, respectively) were characterized using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and metabolic differences were identified through multivariate and univariate statistics. PAK and PAK which displayed lipid A modification with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose showed significant perturbations in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, particularly intermediate metabolites from 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose synthesis and the methionine salvage cycle pathways. Genomics result showed a premature termination (Y275stop) in  (encoding spermidine synthase) in PAK and metabolomics data revealed a decreased intracellular level of spermidine in PAK compared to PAK Our results indicate that spermidine may play an important role in high-level polymyxin resistance in  Interestingly, both  mutants had decreased levels of phospholipids, fatty acids and acyl-coenzyme A compared to the wild-type PAK strain. Moreover, the more resistant PAK mutant exhibited much lower levels of phospholipids than the PAK mutant, suggesting the decreased phospholipid level was associated with polymyxin resistance. In summary, this study provides novel mechanistic information on polymyxin resistance in  and highlights its impacts on bacterial metabolism.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationships between canopy leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and leaf spectral reflectance characteristics of different leaf positions, and to establish useful method for nondestructive and quick assessment of canopy LNC in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Four field experiments were conducted with different N rates and rice cultivars across three growing seasons at different eco-sites, and time-course measurements were taken on leaf hyperspectral reflectance of 350–2 500 nm and LNC at different leaf positions over growth stages. Quantitative relationships and monitoring models of canopy LNC to leaf hyperspectral indices were established by extracting sensitive bands and developing proper spectral indices. The results indicated that the performance of leaf hyperspectral indices were different with varied leaf positions for monitoring canopy LNC, the best single leaf position was the second leaf from the top (L2), the third leaf from the top followed (L3), and the averaged spectra of L2 and L3 (L23) was the optimum leaf spectra combination which contributed to improving the sensitivity to canopy LNC. The simple ratio spectral indices (SR [Rλ1, Rλ2]) combined green reflectance around 560 nm and red-edge reflectance around 705 nm to near infrared region (NIR) could effectively estimate canopy LNC in rice. New green and red-edge narrow band SRs as SR (R780, R580) and SR (R780, R704) performed the best, with the coefficients of determination (R2) respectively as 0.887 and 0.884, and RMSE respectively as 0.216 and 0.235. When the widths of green, red-edge and NIR bands were expanded to 100, 20, and 10 nm respectively, the newly developed broad band SRs as SR [AR(750–850), AR(568–588)] and SR [AR(750–850), AR(699–709)] were also closely related to canopy LNC, with the coefficients of determination (R2) respectively as 0.886 and 0.883, and RMSE respectively as 0.218 and 0.237 at L23 level.",

        "abstract": "A novel ionic liquid-based pressurized liquid extraction (IL-PLE) procedure coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem chemiluminescence (CL) detection capable of quantifying trace amounts of rutin and quercetin in four Chinese medicine plants including Flos sophorae Immaturus, Crateagus pinnatifida Bunge, Hypericum japonicum Thunb and Folium Mori was described in this paper. To avoid environmental pollution and toxicity to the operators, ionic liquids (ILs), 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C(n)mim][Cl]) aqueous solutions were used in the PLE procedure as extractants replacing traditional organic solvents. In addition, chemiluminescence detection was utilized for its minimal interference from endogenous components of complex matrix. Parameters affecting extraction and analysis were carefully optimized. Compared with the conventional ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) and heat-reflux extraction (HRE), the optimized method achieved the highest extraction efficiency in the shortest extraction time with the least solvent consumption. The applicability of the proposed method to real sample was confirmed. Under the optimized conditions, good reproducibility of extraction performance was obtained and good linearity was observed with correlation coefficients (r) between 0.9997 and 0.9999. The detection limits of rutin and quercetin (LOD, S/N=3) were 1.1×10(-2)mg/L and 3.8×10(-3)mg/L, respectively. The average recoveries of rutin and quercetin for real samples were 93.7-105% with relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 5.7%. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first contribution to utilize a combination of IL-PLE with chemiluminescence detection. And the experimental results indicated that the proposed method shows a promising prospect in extraction and determination of rutin and quercetin in medicinal plants.",

The model of root developmental stage was built by calculating physiological ages of different types of root. The elongation process and total length of root were modeled with linear equations. The models were tested with independent experimental data. The comparison between simulated and measured accumulated root length and root number showed that the values of root mean square error were 370.68 cm and 1.27, and the values of relative error were 0.27 and 0.16, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the parameter variations resulted in the modest changes in simulation results, and the model performed well in predicting the dynamic changes in total root length and topological of root structure in wheat.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   OBJECTIVE  To investigate the hormone-like activities of Kuntai capsule (KTC) in the uteri of ovariectomized rats and immature rabbits.    METHODS  Following bilateral ovariectomy, rats were randomly divided into six groups including sham group, control group, estradiol valerate group, KTC 0.24, 0.6, and 1.5 g/kg groups. The rats were treated with 0.5% CMC-Na, estradiol valerate and KTC (0.24, 0.6, and 1.5 g/kg), respectively for 28 consecutive days. Then the estrous cycle, uterine changes and pathological changes were examined. Serum levels of estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P4) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein levels of estradiol receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and nuclear-associated antigen-67 (Ki-67) in uterine tissues were detected by western blot. Immature rabbits were estrogen-primed prior to intragastric administration with KTC for 6 d consecutively. Then, the uteri underwent hematoxylin-eosin staining to observe endometrial transformation.    RESULTS  Compared with the control group, 0.6 and 1.5 g/kg KTC markedly decreased the uterine organ coefficient and endometrial thickness ( P   P   P   P   P      CONCLUSION  KTC does not demonstrate obvious estrogen-like effect on uteri after ovariectomy, but it does exhibit weak progestogen-like effect, by which mechanism of action is yet to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "The fluorescence parameters of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th leaves from the top of culms in two rice varieties (Huajing 2 and Wuxiangjing 9) were measured with FMS-2 at different growth stages under three nitrogen levels, and the leaf nitrogen contents were correspondingly determined by destructive sampling and chemical assay. The leaf nitrogen contents and fluorescence parameters changed significantly with nitrogen levels, tending to increase with the nitrogen application rates. The fluorescence parameters exhibited a parabolic shape over the growth progress, initially increased until heading and then decreased to the lowest from heading to maturity stages. The distributions of fluorescence parameters on main culm in all treatments were L1>L2>L3>L4 (L1, L2, L3 and L4 mean the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th leaf from the top). For the same variety, leaf nitrogen contents at different leaf positions were significantly correlated to fluorescence parameters, with better performance in Huajing 2 than in Wuxiangjing 9. With combined rice varieties, leaf nitrogen contents at different leaf positions were linearly related to fluorescence parameters ΦPSⅡ and qP. Different regression equations should be used to estimate leaf nitrogen contents at different leaf positions with ΦPSⅡ and qP. The results indicated that fluorescence parameters ΦPSⅡ and qP could be potentially useful for estimating leaf nitrogen content in rice.",

        "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as delivery vehicles for nefarious bacterial cargo such as virulence factors, which are antibiotic resistance determinants. This study aimed to investigate the impact of polymyxin B treatment on the OMV lipidome from paired polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant  isolates.  ATCC 700721 was employed as a reference strain in addition to two clinical strains,  FADDI-KP069 and  BM3. Polymyxin B treatment of the polymyxin-susceptible strains resulted in a marked reduction in the glycerophospholipid, fatty acid, lysoglycerophosphate and sphingolipid content of their OMVs. Conversely, the polymyxin-resistant strains expressed OMVs richer in all of these lipid species, both intrinsically and increasingly under polymyxin treatment. The average diameter of the OMVs derived from the  ATCC 700721 polymyxin-susceptible isolate, measured by dynamic light scattering measurements, was ~90.6 nm, whereas the average diameter of the OMVs isolated from the paired polymyxin-resistant isolate was ~141 nm. Polymyxin B treatment (2 mg/L) of the  ATCC 700721 cells resulted in the production of OMVs with a larger average particle size in both the susceptible (average diameter ~124 nm) and resistant (average diameter ~154 nm) strains. In light of the above, we hypothesize that outer membrane remodelling associated with polymyxin resistance in  may involve fortifying the membrane structure with increased glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, lysoglycerophosphates and sphingolipids. Putatively, these changes serve to make the outer membrane and OMVs more impervious to polymyxin attack.",

Sprague-Dawley rats with surgically implanted endometrial autografts were divided randomly into four groups of thirteen rats each, and subcutaneously injected twice (10d apart) with either empty MSs or MSs containing nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC-MS; 27-800mg per kg of rat body weight). Twenty-one days after the first injection, blood and endometriotic tissues were collected and assayed for changes in endometriotic tissue, serum hormone, liver function parameters, and apoptotic protein. No remarkable irritation was observed at the site of injection. NOMAC-MS treatment significantly reduced the volume of the endometrial autografts, decreased serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, triiodothyronine, and alanine aminotransferase, and decreased levels of estrogen receptor alpha protein. Furthermore, NOMAC-MS at the highest dose significantly reduced serum aspartate aminotransferase and endometrial antibody, reduced the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, and increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins. There was no pronounced difference observed in alkaline phosphatase, carbohydrate antigen 125, progesterone receptor, or vascular endometrial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in any of the tested groups relative to the control. NOMAC-MS significantly changed the expression of apoptotic protein only at the highest dose. Our findings warrant the further investigation of sustained application of steroid hormone via microspheres for the treatment of endometriosis.",

        "abstract": "Crop nitrogen status is a key indicator for evaluating crop growth, increasing yield and improving grain quality. Non-destructive and rapid assessment of leaf nitrogen is required for improving nitrogen management in wheat production. This study aims at identification of the quantitative relationship between leaf nitrogen accumulation and canopy reflectance spectra in winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), and to derive regression equations to monitor N nutrition status in wheat. 3 field experiments were conducted with different N application rates and wheat cultivars across 3 growing seasons, and time-course measurements were taken on canopy spectral reflectance, leaf N content and leaf dry weights under various treatments. In these studies, leaf nitrogen accumulation in wheat increased with increasing nitrogen rates. Canopy reflectance changed with increasing leaf nitrogen accumulation. Sensitivity bands mainly occurred in near infrared and visible light, and strong correlation existed between red light and leaf nitrogen accumulation. The relationships of 8 vegetation indicators and leaf nitrogen accumulation were analyzed using statistical models. Hyper-spectral variables were significantly correlated with leaf nitrogen accumulation, and the relationships between the leaf nitrogen accumulation and SDr/SDb, FD742 and AVHRR-GVI were all highly significant with determination of coefficients ( R 2 ) of 0.9163, 0.9097 and 0.9142, respectively, and standard errors (SE) of 1.165, 1.079 and 1.077, respectively. Tests with another independent dataset showed that FD742 and REP IG could be well used to predict leaf nitrogen accumulation in wheat with R 2 of 0.8449 and 0.8394, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.984 and 1.014, respectively. This suggests that FD742 and REP IG can be used to estimate leaf nitrogen accumulation, of which FD742 performed better in modeling and testing.",

The morphology, phase structure, microhardness and wear resistance of the boronizing coating before and after argon arc remelting were analyzed. Results indicate that the boronizing coating is composed of FeB and Fe2 B. After argon arc remelting, FeB phase disappeared, and argon arc remelted zone and transition zone were formed, while new phase Fe23 (C,B) 6 was generated along with Fe2B.

The dried samples of five different soil types in the middle and eastern China were selected to assess the quantitative estimation of SOM based on different modeling methods. First derivative, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) and smoothing algorithms were used to preprocess the original spectra before the calibration models were developed. The results showed that different pre-processing algorithms markedly affected the accuracy of SOM calibration models. The sequence of SOM models with different pre-processing algorithms was MSC + Norris-gap first derivative smoothing filter (NGFD) > MSC > Norris first derivative smoothing filter > standard normal variate (SNV) > Norris-gap second derivative smoothing filter (NGSD) > LOG > Savitzky-Golay first derivative (SGFD) > Savitzky-Golay second derivative (SGSD). The spectra processed with the combination of MSC and NGFD performed the best among all the pre-processing algorithms. In addition, the calibration model based on PLS-BPNN displayed the highest estimation accuracy with R 2 of 0.97 and RMSEP of 1.88, followed by PLS, SMLR and PCR, while the validation model with independent data gave R 2 of 0.97 and RMSEP of 1.72, respectively. These results indicated that PLS-BPNN based on MSC-NGFD spectra was a potentially optimal method for SOM estimation.",

        "title": "Algorithm implementation and tested of crop growth model based on hadoop of cloud computing",
        "abstract": "As the inputs of the crop growth model increased, based on data of multiple sites, weather, and soil, and especially when dealing with massive regional data, the response time of the model gets longer. After a parallel computation scheme of cloud computing was selected in this paper, considering the large amount of weather data, an algorithm of crop growth model based on Cloud Computing was proposed to improve parallel computation speed and response time of the crop growth model. First, the authors analyzed the Crop growth model and data dependence relationships among sub-models, and then summarized different parallel computation schemes. From a system constitution perspective, the crop growth model included model description, model structure, model algorithm, and forcing data. Complex data dependence relations between sub-models and among computing units in the sub-models comprised independency, synchronous dependency, self-reliance, and interdependency. Parallel computation was grouped into data-intensive computing and computing-intensive computing, according to characteristics of the calculation. The former was suitable for computation tasks with large amount of data and simple computing relations, while the latter was suitable for computation tasks with little amount of data and complex computing relations. Second, a scheme of crop growth model based on Cloud Computing was designed on the basis of Hadoop, which is an open-source software of Cloud Computing infrastructure. The MapReduce parallel computation scheme of Crop growth model assumption was that computing tasks of all sub-models in a regional point of the same crop were viewed as a computing job, and a number of computing nodes completed crop growth process computing of multiple regional points. Hence, the granularity of MapReduce parallel computation was a regional point crop, and a computing task of crop growth model could be broken down into multiple sub-computing tasks that executed on different nodes in parallel. The object-oriented approach was employed to design different sub-m. Third, taking Wheat Grow, a wheat growth model from the National Engineering and Technology Center for Information Agriculture, as the testing target, the effectiveness of this scheme was verified in a real Cloud Computing environment. Exemplified by the development stage sub-model, according to contrast research using data-intensive parallel computation methods and computing-intensive parallel computation methods, data-intensive parallel computation methods had better advantages of performance. Therefore, when dealing with crop growth model which had complex data dependence relations, if there appeared more regional data points, the data-intensive parallel computation method was more reasonable to be employed. The advantages of MapReduce extendibility was further reflected based on the more regional data points and the added calculating nodes. When regional points data of crop was fixed, the test line of program runtime fell below the proportional line and increasing tendency gradually became smaller. It also showed that MapReduce had good extendibility. Hadoop was not suitable for processing a small amount of data, and a pseudo-distributed environment was not suitable for the calculation, but pseudo-distributed environment provided convenience for program development. Finally, the authors suggested that this thesis had fixed guidance on regional applications of crop growth mode, and it could achieve both increasing production and income of regional crops and provide reference to promote the development of the crop growth model and the digital agriculture development. Its application prospect was very wide.",

Except rats in the NC group, Freund's complete adjuvant (0. 1 mL) was intracutaneously injected from the right hind limb to prepare the AA rat model. On the 19th day of inflammation rats in the AA model group were randomly divided into four groups, i.e., the XFC group, the methotrexate (MTX) group, the Tripterygium wilfordii polycoride Tablet (TPT) group, and the MC group, 12 in each group. Rats were sacrificed after 30-day medication. The myocardial ultrastructure was observed under transmission electron microscope. The mRNA and protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were detected using RT-PCR and Western blot respectively.(1) Results under electron microscope showed obvious hyperplasia of collagen fibers in myocardial cells of AA rats, which indicated the trend of myocardial fibrosis. The myocardial ultrastructural changes could be effectively improved in the MTX group, the TPT group, and the XFC group. The morphology of myocardial cells in the XFC group was contact, with clear nucleus, and little collagen fibers, which was better than the other groups. (2) Compared with the NC group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-9 in the myocardial tissue of the MC group were obviously up-regulated, while the mRNA and protein expression levels of TIMP-1 were obviously down-regulated (P <0. 01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-9 decreased, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of TIMP-1 obviously increased in the XFC group, showing statistical difference when compared with the MC group (P < 0. 5, P < 0. 01).XFC could effectively inhibit the myocardial fibrosis of AA rats.lts mechanisms might be correlated with inhibiting the mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-9, improving the mRNA and protein expression levels of TIMP-1, adjusting the balance of MMP-9/TIMP-1 ,and improving the metabolism of myocardial extracellular matrix.",

        "abstract": "Development of successful strategies to alleviate adverse impact of climate change on crop production relies on understanding of interactions between climate and crop physiology, and presents a new opportunity for sustainable agriculture. In this study we combine the analysis of 30 years of climate data and observed rice data with crop modeling to investigate the impact of climate change and changes in rice varieties on rice growth and grain yield from 1981 to 2009 at three sites (Nanchang, Hengyang and Gaoyao) in double rice regions in China. The results revealed that while there was a warming trend in general, significant warming mainly occurred before jointing stage of early rice and after jointing of later rice. The adoption of new rice cultivars could only partly mitigate the negative impact of warming on rice growth duration and biomass growth. However, the changes of varieties increased the grain yield of both early and late rice through increased harvest index. The major variety changes involved reduced intrinsic earliness, extended grain filling period, and improved harvest index. In the face of future climate change, a planned breeding effort is needed to maintain or increase grain yield of the double rice system. © 2012.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral reflectance data (350nm to 2500nm) were recorded for five different soil types originating from seven eco-climatic zones in middle and eastern China. Three spectral formats were prepared for use in the development of soil organic matter content (SOM) prediction models: (1) original spectral reflectance (OR), (2) first derivative spectra corrected using the Savitzky-Golay (FD-SG) technique and (3) using Norris (FD-NG) smoothing filters. All two-band combinations of the three types of spectra in ratio index (RI), normalized difference index (NDI) and difference index (DI) were used in linear and non-linear regression analyses with SOM content. A new difference index [DI(NDR554, NDR1398)] composed of the first derivative spectra at 554nm and 1398nm with a FD-NG smoothing filter gave the best prediction of SOM in all two-band indices. Partial least square (PLS) models using FD-NG and calibration of the spectral regions 500-900nm and 1350-1460nm resulted in an R2 of 0.91 (n=331), indicating better performance than that obtained using OR and FD-SG and the entire spectral region (400-2500nm) or their sensitive bands. With principal components extracted by PLS serving as inputs for a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), the PLS-BPNN calibration model for estimating SOM resulted in an improved performance (R2=0.98; n=331). The results were tested with independent validation datasets, which indicated that the models were reliable for SOM estimation with predictive accuracy in the following sequence: PLS-BPNN model>PLS>DI(NDR554, NDR1398). Thus, the PLS-BPNN model may serve as a useful tool for estimating SOM content with high prediction accuracy. Since DI(NDR554, NDR1398) needed only two derivative spectral bands, it is also recommended as a good spectral index for reliably estimating SOM. These results are of significant potential valuable in the field of soil ecosystem observation, specifically for sensor selection and future portable sensor design. Although they were shown to be useful in the five different soil types from middle and eastern China, these models and methods should be further tested in soils sampled from other regions and countries to prove their validity and applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

According to the canopy characteristics of crops and actual requirements of field operation environments, splitting light beams by using an optical filter and proper structural parameters were determined for the sensors. Meanwhile, an integral-type weak optoelectronic signal processing circuit was designed, which changed the gain of the system and guaranteed the high resolution of the apparatus by automatically adjusting the integration period based on the irradiance received from ambient light. In addition, a coupling processor system for a sensor information and growth model based on the microcontroller chip was developed. Field experiments showed that normalised vegetation index (NDVI) measured separately through the CGMD apparatus and the ASD spectrometer showed a good linear correlation. For measurements of canopy reflectance spectra of rice and wheat, their linear determination coefficients (²) were 0.95 and 0.92, respectively while the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.02 and 0.03, respectively. NDVI value measured by using the CGMD apparatus and growth indices of rice and wheat exhibited a linear relationship.

The transcription of mdrl gene was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and the P-gp expression was determined by Western blot after STI 571 alone or combined with neferine treatment.The cytotoxic effect of STI 571 (1 micromol/L) combined with neferine (IC50 = 3.02 micromol/L) on K562/A02 cell line was significantly higher than that of STI 571 alone (IC50 = 0.689 micromol/L). After treating with STI571 combined with neferine, the synergistic interaction on K562/A02 cells increased 4.38 folds (P < 0.05); the mdrl mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR was significantly reduced by (45.4 +/- 2.5) % (P < 0.01); and the P-gp expression by Western blot was deregulated by 40.58% (P < 0.05).Neferine significantly enhances the antineoplastic effect of STI 571 on K562/A02 cells by reducing mdrl mRNA transcription and blocking P-gp expression.",

        "abstract": "Rapid and effective acquisition of crop growth information is a crucial step of precision agriculture for making in-season management decisions. Active canopy sensor GreenSeeker (Trimble Navigation Limited, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is a portable device commonly used for non-destructively obtaining crop growth information. This study intended to expand the applicability of GreenSeeker in monitoring growth status and predicting grain yield of winter wheat ( L.). Four field experiments with multiple wheat cultivars and N treatments were conducted during 2013⁻2015 for obtaining canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) synchronized with four agronomic parameters: leaf area index (LAI), leaf dry matter (LDM), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA). Duration models based on NDVI and RVI were developed to monitor these parameters, which indicated that NDVI and RVI explained 80%, 68⁻70%, 10⁻12%, and 67⁻73% of the variability in LAI, LDM, LNC and LNA, respectively. According to the validation results, the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) were all <0.24 and the relative error (RE) were all <23%. Considering the variation among different wheat cultivars, the newly normalized vegetation indices rNDVI (NDVI vs. the NDVI for the highest N rate) and rRVI (RVI vs. the RVI for the highest N rate) were calculated to predict the relative grain yield (RY, the yield vs. the yield for the highest N rate). rNDVI and rRVI explained 77⁻85% of the variability in RY, the RRMSEs were both <0.13 and the REs were both <6.3%. The result demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring growth parameters and predicting grain yield of winter wheat with portable GreenSeeker sensor.",

        "abstract": "Leaf equivalent water thickness (LEWT) is an important indicator of crop water status. Effectively monitoring the water status of wheat under different nitrogen treatments is important for effective water management in precision agriculture. Trends in the variation of LEWT in wheat plants during plant growth were analyzed based on field experiments in which wheat plants under various water and nitrogen treatments in two consecutive growing seasons. Two-band spectral indices [normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI), ratio spectral indices (RSI), different spectral indices (DSI)], and then three-band spectral indices were established based on the best two-band spectral index within the range of 350-2500 nm to reduce the noise caused by nitrogen and saturation. Then, optimal spectral indices were selected to construct models of LEWT monitoring in wheat. The results showed that the two-band spectral index NDSI(R1204, R1318) could be used for LEWT monitoring throughout the wheat growth season, but the model performed differently before and after anthesis. Therefore, further two-band spectral indices NDSIb(R1445, R487), NDSIa(R1714, R1395), and NDSI(R1429, R416), were constructed for the two developmental phases, with NDSI(R1429, R416) considered to be the best index. Finally, a three-band index (R1429-R416-R1865)/(R1429+R416+R1865), which was superior for monitoring LEWT and reducing the noise caused by nitrogen, was formed on the best two-band spectral index NDSI(R1429, R416) by adding the 1,865 nm wavelenght as the third band. This produced more uniformity and stable performance compared with the two-band spectral indices in the LEWT model. The results are of technical significance for monitoring the water status of wheat under different nitrogen treatments in precision agriculture.",

Experiments were conducted on root growth potential and outplanting performance based on seedling ages and grades. The results showed that: 1) the amount of new roots longer than 1 cm (TNR > 1) was significantly different among seedling ages and grades. TNR > 1 was a better indicator for root growth capacity of L. olgensis seedling in various ages and grades. 2) Seedlings had greater height and wider diameter growth than transplanted seedlings in the first year of outplanting. Super transplanted seedlings had the smallest growth in height and diameter among treatments. The order of outplanting survival rate, from big to small, was grade I seedlings and transplanted seedlings > grade II transplanted seedlings > grade II seedlings and super transplanted seedlings. The results of the multiple regression analysis showed that there was a strong correlation between morphological indicators and TNR >1 as well as outplanting growth. Morphological indicators can be used to predict the growth of L. olgensis seedling after outplanting. From the aspects of outplanting survival rate, seedling growth, cultivation duration and cost, the best seedling used for afforestation is grade I trans planted seedlings, then the second choice is grade I seedlings and grade II transplanted seedlings.",

Results: (1) 15,167 pathogenic strains were collected from female urine specimens in the survey period, which included Escherichia coli 6,838 strains(45.1%), Enterococcus species 2,222 strains(14.7%) and Klebsiellia pneumonia 1,035 strains(6.8%). (2) The resistant rates of E. coli and K. pneumonia to fluoroquinolones were 70% and 45%, and the resistant rates to the third generation cephalosporin were 45.2% and 42.5%, respectively. (3) To almost all the antibiotics, the resistant rates of Enterococcus faecium than those of Enterococcus faecalis. 1.2% E. faecalis and 3.2% E. faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 1.4% and 3.9% were resistant to teicoplanin. (4) The resistant rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than that of S. aureus. No strains of S. aureus was intermediate or resistant to vancomycin, but the intermediate rate of S.epdermidis to teicoplanin was 3.9%. Conclusions: Gram negative bacilli such as E.coli and K. pneumonia were predominant organisms in female urinary tract infections, but Gram positive bacteria such as Entercoccus increased obviously in recent years. The overall and severe bacterial resistance in urinary tract infections should be concerned and the rational use of antibiotics should be emphasized.",

        "abstract": "A knowledge model with temporal and spatial characteristics for the quantitative design of a cultural pattern in wheat production, using systems analysis and dynamic modeling techniques, was developed for wheat management, as a decision-making tool in digital farming. The fundamental relationships and algorithms of wheat growth indices and management criteria to cultivars, ecological environments, and production levels were derived from the existing literature and research data to establish a knowledge model system for quantitative wheat management using Visual C++. The system designed a cultural management plan for general management guidelines and crop regulation indices for time-course control criteria during the wheat-growing period. The cultural management plan module included submodels to determine target grain yield and quality, cultivar choice, sowing date, population density, sowing rate, fertilization strategy, and water management, whereas the crop regulation indices module included submodels for suitable development stages, dynamic growth indices, source-sink indices, and nutrient indices. Evaluation of the knowledge model by design studies on the basis of data sets of different eco-sites, cultivars, and soil types indicated a favorable performance of the model system in recommending growth indices and management criteria under diverse conditions. Practical application of the knowledge model system in comparative field experiments produced yield gains of 2.4% to 16.5%. Thus, the presented knowledge model system overcame some of the difficulties of the traditional wheat management patterns and expert systems, and laid a foundation for facilitating the digitization of wheat management. © 2007 Soil Science Society of China.",

Methods NPTS was performed on 35 eyes of 52 patients with POAG.According to patients’state different implant(amniotic membrane or SKGEL)was applied in NPTS.Intraocular pressure(IOP)was measured pre-and postopreatively.Visual acuity and the bleb appearances were recorded.The following factors were oserved with UBM,conjunctival bleb appearance,value of suprascleral aqueous lake,and the thickness of residual trabeculocorneal membrane,condition of the plant,Follow-up from 1 to 18 months after surgery. Results IOP of postoperation was significantly decreased compared with that of preoperation.At the posterior suprascleral aqueous lakes,transparent liquid space and the implant were observed indistinctly in AM and SKGEL group.The whole transparent liquid space was formed in the group without implant.Afger 3-6 months operation,the posterior liquid space formed and contracted gradually following SKGEL degradated in SKGEL group.Amniotic membrane implant was not degradated until 6-9 months post-operation and transparent liquid space was not formed under th scleral flap.The posterior liquid space contracted gradually in the group without implant.At the end of follow-up,the posterior liquid space in SKGEL group was significantly larger than that in the group without implant.At 1-18 months postoperation the area of anterior equeous lakes were changed significantly and contracted gradually.But the area of anterior aqueous lakes were not varied significantly in three groups at the same time. Conclusions NPTS with different implant effectively reduced IOP in patients with POAG. SKGEL could suppress fibrosis in short-term.AM isn’t shown to possess anti-fibrotic properties and facilitate aqueous outflow in NPTS.The anterior aqueous lakes is the key for success of NPTS.Due to long-time sclera remodeling after surgery,the contraction gradually of suprascleral aqueous lakes may denote that it is hard to predict the long-time effectiveness of NPTS.",

Fluorimetric detection was performed at λex/λem=332 nm/367 nm for imidacloprid and then detector was set at λex/λem=247 nm/470 nm for carbendazim. The two pesticides imidacloprid and carbendazim were successfully separated isocratically on an IonPac(®) AS11 (250 mm × 4 mm i.d; 13 µm particle size, Dionex) anion-exchange column using 40 mM KOH with 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N=3) of imidacloprid and carbendazim were 7.8 µg L(-1) and 67 µg L(-1), respectively. The experimental results showed that there was good linearity with a correlation coefficient (r)≥0.9966 over the range of 0.05-10 mg L(-1) for imidacloprid and 0.2-15 mg L(-1) for carbendazim. Good reproducibility with a relative standard deviation (RSD, n=7) less than 4.5%. Finally, the proposed method was applied with satisfactory results to the analysis of these pesticides in ground water, lake water and river water without any pre-treatment of samples. The average spiked recoveries were in the range of 90-104%.",

However, it is largely unknown whether BM-MSCs derived from MM patients display any aberrant chemotactic migration. To this aim, we compared the chemotactic migration of BM-MSCs derived from MM patients with those from normal subjects. Our results showed that BM-MSCs derived from MM patients migrated more vigorously to myeloma cell line. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was showed to suppress chemotactic migration of BM-MSCs whatever their origins. However, although the chemotactic migration of BM-MSCs derived from MM patients to myeloma cell line was more significantly suppressed by bortezomib treatment, migration to SDF-1 or FBS of BM-MSCs was less compromised. Both SDF-1 and TNF-α enhanced phosphorylation of iκ-Bα in BM-MSCs. Although bortezomib significantly inhibited the iκ-Bα phosphorylation by SDF-1, it had little effect on iκ-Bα phosphorylation by TNF-α. Collectively, our results suggested that aberrant chemotactic migration of BM-MSCs derived from MM patients and the possible migration-regulatory role of bortezomib treatment.",

Different generations of PAMAM dendrimers grafted to polymer matrices containing different glycidylmethacrylate amounts by reacting with epoxy groups in glycidylmethacrylate molecules. The synthesized PAMAM dendrimers and stationary phase were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, N adsorption/desorption, elemental analysis and thermo gravimetric analyzer. The proposed stationary phase was suitable for rapid separation of phenylene diamine isomers and aminobenzene. The separation mechanism of benzene rings attraction and amino repulsion was verified by retention behaviors of methylamine, phenylamine, phenylene diamine, naphthylamine and toluene. The reliability of the stationary phase was demonstrated by separation and determination of phenylene diamine isomers including m-phenylene diamine, o-phenylene diamine and p-phenylene diamine in hair dye precursors within 10min. Satisfactory resolution and short analysis time make the columns promising for determination of aniline compounds in various fields.",

On-line sample clean-up was achieved on the pretreatment column Dionex IonPac NG1 (50 mm × 4 mm, i.d.), with pretreatment elution (3 mmol L−1 MSA) and washing solution (100% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. After column switching, the separation and determination of analytes were performed using guard column Dionex IonPac SGS (50 mm × 4 mm, i.d.) and analytical column Dionex IonPac SCS (250 mm × 4 mm, i.d.) with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of 3 mmol L−1 MSA and 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, at flow-rate of 1 mL min−1, followed by non-suppressed conductivity detection. The organic matrices clean-up performance of the proposed method was studied using an UV detector working at 200–400 nm. Under the optimal conditions, detection limits (S/N = 3) ranging from 0.05–0.30 mg L−1, good linearities in the range of 1–100 mg L−1 with a correlation coefficient over 0.9973, and satisfactory recoveries in the range between 94% and 105% with relative standard deviation less than 2.1% for real samples were attainted.

        "abstract": "Plant analysis is a very promising diagnostic tool for assessment of crop nitrogen (N) requirements in perspectives of cost effective and environment friendly agriculture. Diagnosing N nutritional status of rice crop through plant analysis will give insights into optimizing N requirements of future crops. The present study was aimed to develop a new methodology for determining the critical nitrogen (Nc) dilution curve based on stem dry matter (SDM) and to assess its suitability to estimate the level of N nutrition for rice (Oryza sativa L.) in east China. Three field experiments with varied N rates (0-360 kg N ha(-1)) using three Japonica rice hybrids, Lingxiangyou-18, Wuxiangjing-14 and Wuyunjing were conducted in Jiangsu province of east China. SDM and stem N concentration (SNC) were determined during vegetative stage for growth analysis. A Nc dilution curve based on SDM was described by the equation (Nc = 2.17W(-0.27) with W being SDM in t ha(-1)), when SDM ranged from 0.88 to 7.94 t ha(-1). However, for SDM < 0.88 t ha(-1), the constant critical value Nc = 1.76% SDM was applied. The curve was dually validated for N-limiting and non-N-limiting growth conditions. The N nutrition index (NNI) and accumulated N deficit (Nand) of stem ranged from 0.57 to 1.06 and 51.1 to -7.07 kg N ha(-1), respectively, during key growth stages under varied N rates in 2010 and 2011. The values of ΔN derived from either NNI or Nand could be used as references for N dressing management during rice growth. Our results demonstrated that the present curve well differentiated the conditions of limiting and non-limiting N nutrition in rice crop. The SDM based Nc dilution curve can be adopted as an alternate and novel approach for evaluating plant N status to support N fertilization decision during the vegetative growth of Japonica rice in east China.",

        "abstract": "A rapid and simple approach involving two-dimensional ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) combined with ion chromatography (IC) through valve-switching was developed to determine parabens and inorganic anions in cosmetics simultaneously. Compared with a conventional IC column-switching technique, the proposed method required UHPLC coupled with IC via valve-switching without refreshing the pretreatment column. In this chromatographic system, a mobile phase with 60% methanol and 40% deionized water was used to simultaneously separate parabens, namely, methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), and butylparaben (BP), and to eliminate the matrix, and KOH eluent (20 mmol L−1) was utilized to separate inorganic anions, such as nitrite, sulfite, sulfate, and nitrate. Organic compound analysis, and inorganic anion pretreatment and analysis were simultaneously performed with a single injection. Under optimized conditions, matrix–calibration curves were examined by preparing and analyzing different concentrations of mixture standard solutions containing parabens and inorganic anions. Linearity was between 0.9994 and 0.9999. The limits of detection ranged from 8.0 to 80 μg L−1. Satisfactory recoveries of cosmetic samples were obtained between 93.9% and 106.2% by adding three representative standard solutions. The proposed method can be applied to routine analysis, as indicated by the validated linearity, accuracy, and precision and potential application on the analysis of MP, EP, PP, BP, nitrite, sulfite, sulfate and nitrate in eight commercial samples.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen concentration in crop plants is a key index for assessing plant growth status and predicting grain yield and quality. Non-destructive monitoring and diagnosis of plant nitrogen status is of significant importance for precise nitrogen management and productivity forecasting for field crops.The present study was conducted to determine the quantitative relationships of leaf nitrogen concentration to canopy reflectance spectra in both wheat and rice. Ground-based canopy spectral reflectance and nitrogen concentrations in leaves were measured with six field experiments consisting of five different rice varieties and three different wheat varieties and varied nitrogen fertilization levels across six growing seasons. All possible ratio vegetation indices (RVI), difference vegetation indices (DVI), and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) of sixteen wavebands from the MSR16 radiometer were calculated. Analyses were made to determine the relationships of seasonal canopy spectral reflectance and all possible vegetation indices to leaf nitrogen concentrations in rice and wheat under different nitrogen treatments and variety types.The results showed, as expected, that nitrogen concentrations in wheat and rice leaves increased with increasing nitrogen fertilization rates. Canopy reflectance, however, was a more complicated relationship. In the near infrared portion of the spectrum (760～1100 nm), canopy reflectance increased with increasing nitrogen supply, whereas in the visible region (460～710 nm), canopy reflectance decreased with increasing nitrogen supply. For both rice and wheat, leaf nitrogen concentration was best evaluated at 610, 660 and 680 nm. Among all possible RVIs, DVIs, and NDVIs, the NDVI(1220, 610) was most highly correlated with leaf nitrogen concentrations in both rice and wheat. In addition, the correlation of NDVI(1220,610) to leaf nitrogen concentration was found to be higher than that of individual wavebands at 610, 660 and 680nm in both rice and wheat. These results indicated that leaf nitrogen concentrations in both wheat and rice could be monitored with common wavelengths and spectral parameters, and the integrated regression equation could be used to describe the dynamic change patterns of leaf nitrogen concentrations in rice and wheat with reflectance spectra parameters, although separate regression coefficients would slightly enhance the prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Crop organ morphological model is one of the key technologies of virual crop. By observing and analyzing the morphological and topological structures of wheat spike, the morphological parameter-based 3D geometric model and visualization method were developed. Based on the existing morphological model of spike in wheat, the 3D morphological geometric model of wheat spike was constructed by integrating the topological structure of spike, including the submodels of ear axis, spikelet (including outer bran, awn and anther) and spike shape. The ear axis was constructed by connected proglottids which were represented by slant cylinder. Based on the surface vertical curve, the outer bran was simulated by approximate semiellipsoid with triangular faces. The awn, with transversal surface as nearly equilateral triangular, was constructed by triangular faces based on the curve of awn. The anther on the top of floret in flowering stage was simulated with NURBS surface. In addition, the spike shape was controlled by using hierarchical model. Then according to the topological structure, the above organ models were organized together to rebuild the whole 3D geometric model of wheat spike. By further integrating the rendering models of color, texture and light, the visualization of growth dynamic of wheat spike was realized based on the platform of Microsoft.Net and CSOpenGL graphic library. The reconstructed geometric model with three dimensions can simulate visualization of growth dynamic of wheat spike under different varieties and treatments. The result will be helpful to realizing the realistic simulation of wheat plant, and the digitalization and visualization of growth dynamic of wheat.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there are rising concerns about the extensive use of the antibiotics such as chloramphenicol (CAP), has threatened the human life in the form of various vicious diseases. The limited selectivity and sensitivity of confirmatory techniques (UV and electrochemical) and non-fluorescence property of CAP make its determination a challenging task in the modern pharmaceutical analysis. In order to redeem the selective, sensitive and cost-effective fluorescence methodology, here by the dual role of synthesized porous SnO nanoparticles were exploited; (i) a porous sorbent in a µ-QuEChERS based sample preparation and as (ii) a stimulant for the transformation of non-fluorescent analytes namely CAP and p-nitrophenol (p-NP) into their respective fluorescent product. We report a green, simple, selective and cost effective ion chromatographic method for CAP sensitive determination in three complex matrices including milk, human urine and serum. The synthesized sorbent not only selectively adsorbed and degraded the matrix/interferences but also selectively reduced the non-fluorescent antibiotic CAP into a fluorescent species. This developed ion chromatographic method exhibited good selectivity, linearity (r ≥ 0.996) and limit of detection (LOD) was in the range 0.0201-0.0280 µg/kg. The inter- and intraday precisions were also satisfactory having a relative standard deviation (RSDs) less than 14.96% and excellent recoveries of CAP in the range of 78.3-100.2% were retrieved in various complex samples.",

        "abstract": "A method for the simultaneous determination of alendronate, pamidronate, ibandronate and risedronate using ion chromatography with integrated pulsed amperometric detection (IPAD) has been developed. The electrochemical behavior showed the catalytic currents of these bisphosphonates are based on the oxidation of amines in their structures. Because the bisphosphonates are polar compounds and present as anions under alkaline condition, therefore, they can be separated by anion exchange chromatography. A Dionex AS18 column (250 mm x 2 mm) and an AG18 column (50 mm x 2 mm) and 24 mmol/L NaOH solution were used for the separation. Multi-step potential waveform parameters were optimized to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), which exhibited adsorption/desorption catalytic features at the gold electrode surface in alkaline solution. Utilizing the optimized waveform, the method showed good linearity (r2 = 0.9972 - 0.9995), satisfactory repeatability (relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the peak areas in the range of 0.84% - 1.37%) and sufficient sensitivity (limits of detection of 0.061 - 0.18 microg/mL) for the identification of the four bisphosphonates. The recoveries were 80.81% - 97.32% with the RSDs of 1.46% - 3.02%. It is demonstrated that this method is a rapid and simple one for the determination of the four bisphosphonates in human plasma.",

        "abstract": "Proprotein convertase 5/6 (PC6) is critical for endometrial epithelial receptivity and stromal cell decidualization for embryo implantation in women. We hypothesized that inhibiting PC6 could block implantation for contraception. The aim of this study was to prove this concept using human cell models and rabbits.A potential PC6 inhibitor, C1239-PEG-Poly R, was biochemically confirmed to be a potent PC6 inhibitor. The potential contraceptive action of the inhibitor was then tested in decidualization of primary human endometrial stromal cells in a human trophoblast spheroid attachment model and in vivo in rabbits.The PC6 inhibitor C1239-PEG-Poly R inhibited in a dose-dependent manner both decidualization and spheroid attachment. Vaginal delivery of 200 μL of the inhibitor at a final concentration of 5 mM to rabbits over a 3-day period starting 6 days after mating resulted in a 60% decrease in implantation and, hence, pregnancy.This study presents proof of concept that PC6 inhibition has the potential to block embryo implantation, providing nonhormonal contraception for women.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects of epristeride on vas deferens epithelial cells in rat and the expression of bcl-2. METHODS: Vas deferens epithelial cells were cultured in medium with variable doses of epristeride for 72 h. The treated cells were examined under light microscope, transmission electron microscope and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry was performed for detecting the expression of bcl-2. RESULTS: There was no obvious morphological change on the cells after being pre-treated with epristeride at 0.1 μmol · L-1. After treatment with epristeride at 0.3 and 1.0 μmol · L-1 the cells became condensed- and the chromatin clinged to the periphery of the nuclear. Apoptotic bodies were observed. The percentages of apoptotic cells were 3.42% ± 1.49%, 4.66% ± 2.23%, 39.04 ± 10.69% and 52.74% ± 8.91% respectively, after treatment with epristeride at 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 μmol · L-1 for 72 h. The result of immunohistochemistry showed that there was a expression of bcl-2 on the cells. Epristeride may reduce the expression at 0.3 and 1.0 μmol · L-1. The expression percentages of bcl-2 on the cells were 76.96% ± 9.25%, 63.93% ± 3.40%, 52.82% ± 8.66% and 29.64% ± 8.74%, respectively, after being treated with epristeride at the concentration of 0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 μmol · L-1 for 72 h. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment with epristeride at 0.1 μmol · L-1 results in no remarkable change in the cells. Epristeride induces apoptosis on vas deferens epithelial cell in SD rat in vitro at the concentration of 0.3, 1.0 μmol · L-1, and the mechanism may involve reducing the expression of bcl-2.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】This study aimed at identification of the quantitative relationship between plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) and canopy reflectance spectra in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)【.Method】Three field experiments with different wheat varieties and nitrogen levels were conducted. The time-course measurements were taken on canopy hyperspectral reflectance and weights and nitrogen contents in different plant parts during the experimental period. 【Result】Nitrogen accumulation in wheat plant increased with increasing nitrogen fertilization rates, with significant differences among growing seasons. The bands sensitive to PNA occurred during visible light and near-infrared region mostly, and correlation decreased between canopy reflectance and above-ground nitrogen accumulation (ANA). The regression analyses between vegetation indices and PNA indicated that several key spectral parameters could accurately estimate the changes in plant nitrogen status across different growth stages, nitrogen levels and growing seasons, with same spectral parameters for each wheat cultivar. The cumulative value of PNA from anthesis to specific day were highly correlated with grain nitrogen accumulation (GNA) at corresponding day, with the determination of coefficient (R2) as 0.883 and standard error (SE) of 1.736 from linear equation, respectively. Based on the technical route of key spectralparameters-plant nitrogen nutrition index-GNA, estimating models of GNA were constructed on the basis of canopy hyper-spectral parameters by linking the above two models with plant nitrogen nutrition as intersection in wheat. Total monitoring models on ANA during filling period were established using canopy hyper-spectral parameters by adding GNA to PNA. Tests with other independent dataset showed that several key spectral indices such as SDr/SDb, VOG2, VOG3, RVI (810, 560), [(R750-800)/(R695-740)]-1 and Dr/Db could be used to predict ANA. 【Conclusion】It can be concluded that ANA in wheat could be monitored directly by key vegetation indices, with more reliable estimation from VOG2, VOG3 and [(R750-800)/(R695-740)]-1.",

        "abstract": "Polypropylene (PP) /polystyrene ( PS) /clay composites were prepared by melt blending at 1600C to investigate the dispersion of clay in the immiscible blend system.The results show that the preferential intercalation phenomenon of clay occur in the immiscible PP/PS blend,as evidenced by wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) .Independing on the proportion of PS components and its feeding modes,PS chains intercalate preferentially into clay layers. PP and PS components show different dependence of melt viscosity on temperature, as confirmed by capillary rheological analysis and advanced rheological expansion system ( ARES ) measurements. PS has higher viscous flow activation energy, which means its melt viscosity is more sensitive to the processing temperature. Based on different dependence of melt viscosity on temperature between PP and PS, the effects of melt viscosity on the preferential intercalation behavior of clay were investigated via changing the processing temperatures. The clay platelets gradually transferred from PS phase to PP phase with increasing processing temperature. The results combining TEM and ARES suggest that the preferential intercalation behavior of clay is determined by the difference between the viscosity of the two components. Furthermore, the higher viscosity of component, the stronger shear stress during the compounding process, it consequently results in stronger capabilities of intercalation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   An approach for preparation of a novel composite anion exchanger composed of polystyrene/divinylbenzene (PS/DVB) beads and quaternized nanodiamods (QND) were proposed. Oxidized nanodiamonds (OND) were quaternized by the condensation polymerization between methylamine (MA) and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE), which were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, X-ray phtoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). QND with layers of cationic polyelectrolyte was attached onto the surface of sulfonated PS/DVB beads electrostatically. Subsequently, hyperbranched reaction of QND agglomerated on the PS/DVB bead surface was performed by the alternate reaction between MA and BDDE to increase the exchange capacity. The composite anion exchanger showed good stability in organic solvent and a wide pH range. The surface of these microspheres was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, ion exchange selectivity and separation efficiency of the anion exchangers were assessed using the mixtures of anions (F − , Cl − , NO 2  − , Br − , NO 3  − , HPO 4  2−  and SO 4  2− ) with carbonate/bicarbonate as eluent, and the anion exchanger with high exchange capacity could be used to analyze chloride in aqueous solution with high concentration of fluoride.

        "abstract": "As one of the chlorinated antifertility compounds, alpha-chlorohydrin (ACH) can inhibit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity in epididymal sperm and affect sperm energy metabolism, maturation and fertilization, eventually leading to male infertility. Further studies demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of ACH on G3PDH is not only confined to epididymal sperm but also to the epididymis. Moreover, little investigation on gene expression changes in the epididymis after ACH treatment has been conducted. Therefore, gene expression studies may indicate new epididymal targets related to sperm maturation and fertility through the analysis of ACH-treated infertile animals.Rats were treated with ACH for ten consecutive days, and then each male rat copulated with two female rats in proestrus. Then sperm maturation and other fertility parameters were analyzed. Furthermore, we identified epididymal-specific genes that are associated with fertility between control and ACH groups using an Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 oligo-microarray. Finally, we performed RT-PCR analysis for several differentially expressed genes to validate the alteration in gene expression observed by oligonucleotide microarray.Among all the differentially expressed genes, we analyzed and screened the down-regulated genes associated with metabolism processes, which are considered the major targets of ACH action. Simultaneously, the genes that were up-regulated by chlorohydrin were detected. The genes that negatively regulate sperm maturation and fertility include apoptosis and immune-related genes and have not been reported previously. The overall results of PCR analysis for selected genes were consistent with the array data.In this study, we have described the genome-wide profiles of gene expression in the epididymides of infertile rats induced by ACH, which could become potential epididymal specific targets for male contraception and infertility treatment.",

        "abstract": "The thermal and flame retardancy properties of polypropylene/fullerene (PP/C(60)) nanocomposites were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cone calorimetry with the C(60) loading varied from 0.5 to 2% by weight. Dispersion of C(60) in the PP matrix was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy (OM). TGA and DSC results showed that the presence of C(60) could remarkably enhance the thermal property and cone calorimeter measurements suggested that C(60) could to some extent reduce the flammability of PP, with a significant reduction in peak heat release rate and a much longer time to ignition. Furthermore, the larger the loading level of C(60), the better the flame retardancy property of PP/C(60) nanocomposites. The flame retardation mechanism and corresponding model were proposed with the help of rheological measurements, TEM and x-ray diffraction. C(60) reduced the flammability of PP by trapping free radicals in the gas phase and in situ forming a gelled-ball crosslink network to improve the flame retardancy of PP in the condensed phase. Finally, this suggested mechanism was supported by the results of advanced rheological extended systems (ARES), gel content, infrared spectrum, OM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements.",

In this work, a new method for the determination of trace aromatic amines, including o-toluidine and 4-chloroaniline in waste water was developed by hollow fiber membrane extraction with ion chromatography. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: by using 1-octanol as the organic phase with 500 g/L NaCl and 0.01 mol/L NaOH as the donor phase, and 0.1 mol/L HCl as the acceptor phase, the extraction was performed at a stirring rate of 430 r/min for 30 min. The linear range of both of o-toluidine and 4-chloroaniline was 0.005 - 0.1 mg/L, with correlation coefficients larger than 0. 999. The detection limits of o-toluidine and 4-chloroaniline were 0.2 microg/L and 0.5 microg/L with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.85% and 3.38%, respectively.

This paper addresses the problems of efficient construction of secure steganography in ordinary covert channels. Without relying on any sampling assumption, we provide a general construction of secure steganography under computational indistinguishability. Our results show that unpredictability of mapping function in covertext sampler is indispensable for secure stegosystem on indistinguishability against adaptive chosen hiddentext attacks. We completely prove that computationally secure steganography can be constructed on pseudorandom function and unbiased sampling function under ordinary covert channels, that is, its security is inversely proportional to the sum of errors of these two functions, as well as the legth of hiddentexts. More importantly, our research is not dependent upon pseudorandom ciphertext assumption of cryptosystem or perfect sampling assumption. Hence, our results are practically useful for construction and analysis of secure stegosystems.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】 The amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception and distribution within canopy affects crop photosynthesis and biomass production. The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship of PAR interception of canopy to leaf area and yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.) under different nitrogen rates for different cultivar types. 【Method】 Two field experiments were conducted at Nanjing in 2007 and 2008 rice growing seasons,involving two rice cultivars and three nitrogen rates. The amount of PAR interception and its distribution at different canopy heights,leaf area and yield of two cultivars were measured from jointing to maturity. 【Result】 The results indicated that the vertical distribution of upward cumulative leaf area index (LAI) followed a sigmoid curve,which could be described well with Logistic equation (R2>0.99). The maximum leaf area density in heading,17 days after heading and maturity stages appeared at 0.53,0.56 and 0.60 of relative canopy height,respectively. The relative leaf area density of upper and middle canopy increased with rice development progress,but the relative leaf area density of basal canopy decreased with rice development progress. The relationship between fraction of PAR interception (FIPAR) and downward cumulative LAI could be described with a negative exponential equation as FIPAR=α×(1-e-K×LAI) (R2>0.86). Diurnal variation of extinction coefficient (K) at noon was smaller than in the morning and afternoon,and the value of K decreased with rice development progress. The amount of PAR interception (AIPAR) showed multi-peaks distribution during rice development period,and the maximum peak appeared at 58-70 d after transplanting,around booting to heading stages. The AIPAR increased with increasing nitrogen application rate. Diurnal variation of AIPAR showed one peak distribution on the clear days,and the maximum AIPAR appeared at 11:00-13:00 in rice canopy. 【Conclusion】 The vertical distribution of leaf area affects PAR interception within rice canopy. The grain yield of rice was positively related to the PAR use efficiency,while PAR conversion efficiency first increased and then decreased with increasing PAR interception,thus it is benefit to have some penetration loss of PAR in rice canopy for high grain yield.",

        "abstract": "Ion chromatography has been proposed for the determination of three common inorganic anions (chloride, nitrate, and sulfate) in nine weak acids (tartaric acid, citric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, metacetonic acid, butyric acid, butanedioic acid, hexafluorophosphoric acid, and salicylic acid) using a single pump, two valves, a single eluent, and a single conductivity detector. The present system uses ion exclusion, concentrator, and anionexchange columns connected in series via 6-port and 10-port valves in a Dionex ICS-2100 ion chromatograph. The valves were switched for the determination of three inorganic anions from weak acids in a single chromatographic run. Sample matrices of weak acids with a series of concentrations can be investigated. Complete separations of the previously mentioned anions are demonstrated within 40 min. Under the optimum conditions, the relative standard deviation values ranged from 1.3 to 3.8%. The detection limits of the three inorganic anions (S/N = 3) were in the range of 0.3-1.7 μg/L. The recoveries were in the range of 75.2-117.6%. With this system, automation for routine analysis, short analysis time, and low cost can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Stem cells in both plant and animal kingdoms reside in a specialized cellular context called stem-cell niche (SCN). SCN integrity is crucial for organism development. Here we show that the H3/H4 histone chaperone CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR-1 (CAF-1) and the H2A/H2B histone chaperone NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN1/2 (NRP1/2) play synergistic roles in Arabidopsis root SCN maintenance. Compared to either the m56-1 double mutant deprived of NRP1 and NRP2 or the fas2-4 mutant deprived of CAF-1, the combined m56-1fas2-4 triple mutant displayed a much more severe short-root phenotype. The m56-1fas2-4 mutant root lost the normal organizing center QC (Quiescent Center), and some initial stem cells differentiate precociously. Microarray analysis unraveled deregulation of 2735 genes within the Arabidopsis genome (representing > 8% of all genes) in the m56-1fas2-4 mutant roots. Expression of some SCN key regulatory genes (e.g. WOX5, PLT1, SHR) was not limiting rather the plant hormone auxin gradient maximum at QC was impaired. The mutant roots showed programmed cell death and high levels of the DNA damage mark histone H2A.X phosphorylation (γ-H2A.X). Knockout of either ATM or ATR, encoding a DNA damage response kinase, rescued in part the cell death and the short-root phenotype of the m56-1fas2-4 mutant. Collectively, our study indicates that NRP1/2 and CAF-1 act cooperatively in regulating proper genome transcription, in sustaining chromatin replication and in maintaining genome integrity, which are crucial for proper SCN function during continuous post-embryonic root development.

        "title": "Estimation of nitrogen nutrient index on SPAD value of top leaves in wheat",
        "abstract": "Rapid, accurate, and dynamic diagnosis of nitrogen nutrition status is essential for evaluating vigor, for predicting production rates, and for agricultural management of cultivated wheat. To determine the critical nitrogen concentration dilution curve for wheat, two field experiments with different levels of N application (0, 75, 150, 225, 300 and 375 kg/ hm2) were conducted in Yizheng, China. According to the procedure in Justes's curve, the dry matter and nitrogen concentrations under different nitrogen treatments could be compared by analysis of variance at the 5% probability level. Based on this curve, we developed a nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this index, when NNI=1, nitrogen nutrition was considered to be optimum, NNI>1 indicated excess nitrogen, and NNI<1 indicated nitrogen deficiency. We further investigated relationships between NNI and soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter values and normalized differential SPADij(NDSPADij) values obtained at the top four leaf positions in wheat. We conducted a linear parallel curve analysis with grouped data to determine if the linear quantitative equation relating NNI to SPAD value or NDSPADij showed differences between varieties and/ or years. The results showed that the curve had specific biological significance. The relationship between the critical nitrogen concentration and wheat dry matter could be described by the following negative power equations Y16: Ncnc=4. 65DM-0. 44 and N13: Ncnc= 4. 33DM-0. 45. The critical nitrogen curves of the two cultivars of wheat had the same coefficient \" b\" but different coefficients \" a\". Y16 had a higher nitrogen accumulation capacity than N13. The NNI values ranged from 0. 37 to 1. 28, and increased with higher nitrogen application rates under the different nitrogen levels. The optimum nitrogen level was 150 kg/ hm2 in 2009 - 2010, but was 225 kg/ hm2 in 2010-2011. The SPAD values increased with increasing N application rates, and ranged from 34. 3 to 52. 8. In contrast, the NDSPADij value decreased with increasing nitrogen application rates, which showed that increasing amounts of nitrogen could decrease the differences in SPAD value among the top four single leaves of wheat. The NDSPADij values ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 143. The SPAD value at the top four single leaf positions were significantly positively related to NNI. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 666 to 0. 823. The strongest correlation was between the SPAD value at the top leaf (T1) and NNI, while the weakest correlation was between the SPAD value at the second leaf (T2) and NNI. A linear parallel curve analysis with grouped data approximated the relationship between SPAD and NNI and its differences between varieties and years. This will be useful for diagnoses of wheat nitrogen nutrition. In contrast, NDSPADij was significantly negatively related to NNI, except for NDSPAD12 . The correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 01 to -0. 849. The strongest correlation was between NDSPAD14 and NNI, while the weakest correlation was between NDSPAD12 and NNI. A linear parallel curve analysis with grouped data demonstrated the relationship between NDSPAD14 and NNI (NNI= -2. 019NDSPAD14 +1. 18, R =-0. 838**) stably across variety and year differences. This analysis could be used to assess NNI quantitatively and to diagnose wheat nitrogen deficiency quickly.",

        "abstract": "A comparative study was made to evaluate the methods of inverse distance weighting (IDW), co-kriging (CK), and thin plate spline (TPS) in interpolating the average meteorological elements (including maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, sunshine hours, and precipitation) of the 15th day per month from the 1951-2005 comprehensive observation data of 559 meteorological stations in China. The results showed that the RMSEs for the maximum and minimum air temperature in a year interpolated by TPS were the smallest (1.02 degrees C and 1.12 degrees C, respectively), and the R2 between the observed and predicted values were the highest (0.9916 and 0.9913, respectively), compared with those interpolated by IDW and CK. In four seasons, the smallest RMSEs for the maximum and minimum air temperature interpolated by TPS were observed in autumn (0.83 degrees C) and summer (0.86 degrees C), respectively, and the R2 between the observed and predicted values interpolated by TPS were higher in autumn than in other seasons. The RMSEs for the sunshine hours and precipitation in a year interpolated by TPS were the smallest (0.59 h and 1.01 mm, respectively), and the R2 between the observed and predicted values were the highest (0.9118 and 0.8135, respectively), compared with those interpolated by IDW and CK. In four seasons, the RMSE for the sunshine hours in winter interpolated by TPS was the smallest (0.49 h), and the R2 between the observed and predicted sunshine hours was the smallest (0.9293). The RMSE for the precipitation in winter interpolated by TPS was the smallest (0.33 mm), while the RMSE for the precipitation in summer interpolated by IDW was the smallest (2.01 mm). The R2 between the observed and predicted precipitation in winter interpolated by CK was the highest (0.8781). It was suggested that TPS could be the optimal spatial interpolation method in interpolating and rasterizing the daily meteorological elements in China.",

        "abstract": "To understand seed salt tolerance of different mulberry varieties and its molecular mechanism is of great significance in breeding salt resistant mulberry varieties and developing mulberry industry in saline and alkaline land. In present study,hybrid seeds of several practical mulberry varieties were treated with NaCl solutions of different concentrations to investigate mulberry seed germination and expression level of Na+/H+antiporter protein gene. The results showed that 25mmol /L NaCl stress had no obvious influence on mulberry seed germination,except slight decreases in root length and shoot length of the germinated seedlings. Under 50 mmol /L NaCl stress,germination vigor and moisture content of the mulberry seeds decreased significantly. Under 150 mmol /L NaCl stress,germination rate of the mulberry seeds decreased significantly. According to relative germination vigor,germination rate and germination index,the membership function value was calculated to comprehensively evaluate salt tolerance of mulberry varieties. The salt tolerance of tested mulberry varieties was in the order of Guisang 12 > Guisang 62 > Teyou 2 > Teyou 1. After being treated with 100 mmol /L NaCl for 24 h,the expression level of Na+/H+antiporter protein gene in root,stem and leaf of germinated seedlings of salt-sensitive mulberry variety Teyou 1 was significantly up-regulated. The above results indicated that germination ability of mulberry seeds showed a clear downward trend with the increase of salt concentration. Especially,the decrease of germination vigor was the most obvious. Also,the salt tolerance of different mulberry varieties was different. High expression level of Na+/H+antiporter protein gene was induced in the germinated seedlings to adapt abrupt rise of Na+.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, a novel three-dimensional ionic liquid functionalized magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposite (3D-IL@mGO) was prepared, and used as an effective adsorbent for the magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction (MSPE) of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in vegetable oil prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The properties of 3D-IL@mGO were characterized by scanning electron micrographs (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The 3D-IL@mGO, functionalized by ionic liquid, exhibited high adsorption toward PAHs. Compared to molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE), the MSPE method based on 3D-IL@mGO had less solvent consumption and low cost, and was more efficent to light PAHs in quantitative analysis. Furthermore, the rapid and accurate GC–MS method coupled with 3D-IL@mGO MSPE procedure was successfully applied for the analysis of 16 PAHs in eleven vegetable oil samples from supermarket in Zhejiang Province. The results showed that the concentrations of BaP in 3 out of 11 samples were higher than the legal limit (2.0 μg/kg, Commission Regulation 835/2011a), the sum of 8 heavy PAHs (BaA, CHR, BbF, BkF, BaP, IcP, DaA, BgP) in 11 samples was between 3.03 μg/kg and 229.5 μg/kg. Validation results on linearity, specificity, accuracy, precision and stability, as well as on application to the analysis of PAHs in oil samples demonstrated the applicability to food safety risk monitoring in China.",

Folic acid (FA) and methotrexate (MTX) were preliminarily used as prototype analytes to test the performance of EC. After separation by an anion exchange column, FA and MTX, which emit very weak fluorescence when excited, were electrochemically oxidized online in the anode chamber of the EC. The compounds with strong fluorescence, which are oxidation products, were detected by the fluorescence detector. The phosphate buffer solution (100 mM KH(2)PO(4)) served as an optimal eluent for anion exchange chromatographic separation and a suitable supporting electrolyte for electro-oxidation, leading to ideal compatibility between IC separation and the postcolumn electrochemical derivatization. For the presently proposed method, the linear ranges were from 0.01 mg L(-1) to 5 mg L(-1) for both FA and MTX. The detection limits of FA and MTX were 1.8 and 2.1 μg L(-1), and the relative standard deviations (RSD, n=7) were 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. The method was applied for the simultaneous determination of FA and MTX in the plasma of patients being treated for rheumatoid arthritis. The determination of MTX in the urine of the patients of diffuse large B cell lymphoma was also demonstrated.",

Herein we report the fabrication and application of a graphene-coated polymeric stationary phase for anion exchange chromatography. The graphene-coated particles were fabricated by a facile evaporation-reduction method. These hydrophilic particles were proven appropriate substrates for grafting of hyperbranched condensation polymers (HBCPs) to make pellicular anion exchangers. The new phase was characterized by zeta potentials, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and scanning electron microscope. Frontal displacement chromatography showed that the capacities of the anion exchangers were tuned by both graphene amount and HBCPs layer count. The chromatographic performance of graphene-coated anion exchangers was demonstrated with separation of inorganic anions, organic acids, carbohydrates and amino acids. Good reproducibility was obtained by consecutive injections, indicating high chemical stability of the coating.",

The new material was characterized by scanning electron microscope, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that poly (GMA-DVB) microspheres had good monodispersity, porosity and ball shapes. The diameters and specific surface area of the microspheres were about 6µm and 396m(2)g(-1), respectively. ODA-poly (GMA-DVB) stationary phase had good thermal stability. Furthermore, the chromatographic performance of the stationary phase was illustrated by separating n-alkylbenzenes, mono-substituted benzenes and N-nitrosamines. Auxiliary quantum chemistry calculation was also carried out to evaluate the interaction mechanism. According to the evaluation, ODA-poly (GMA-DVB) stationary phase exhibited good hydrophobicity and hydrophobic selectivity, strong stereo-selectivity, polar interaction and π-π interaction. The multi-interaction mechanisms could very likely guarantee its excellent chromatographic performance for the analysis of complex samples. Finally, the column was successfully applied in the determination of N-nitrosamines in pickles sample.",

        "abstract": "Three years (2003-2006) field experiment was conducted with different wheat varieties and nitrogen (N) supply, and time-course measurements were made on the canopy hyperspectral reflectance, plant dry mass and its N content. Based on the technique route of characteristic spectral parameters-leaf N nutrition-grain protein yield, and with leaf N nutrition as a link, the prediction models of wheat grain protein yield based on the canopy hyperspectal parameters at anthesis were constructed. The results showed that the wheat grain protein yield at maturity increased with increasing N supply. Plant N nutritional status, such as leaf N content (LNC) and leaf N accumulation (LNA) at anthesis and leaf N transportation (LNT) after anthesis, could well indicate the grain protein yield at maturity. The regression analysis between existing vegetation indices and leaf N index indicated that some key spectral parameters could accurately estimate the changes in leaf N status across a broad ranges of growth stages, N supply and growing seasons, with unified spectral parameters for each wheat cultivar, such as REPle and mND705 for leaf N content, and SDr/SDb and FD742 for leaf N accumulation. The testing of the predic- tion models with independent dataset indicated that the spectral indices of REPle, SDr/SDb and FD742 could give accurate grain protein yield estimation, and the R 2 of REPle, SDr/SDb and FD742 was 0. 854, 0. 803 and 0. 795, with the RE of 16. 4%, 18. 2% and 14. 9%, respectively. Overall, the wheat grain protein yield at maturity could be predicted by the key characteristic spectral indices at anthesis.",

        "abstract": "The study was to investigate the effect of gestrinone on the growth of human uterine leiomyoma cells and on the levels and activity of p38, Src and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Human uterine leiomyoma cells were cultured and treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or a gestrinone concentration gradient. Morphological changes were observed and apoptosis was evaluated. Levels of p38 and phosphorylated-p38 (pp38) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Levels of ERα and Src were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The result showed that gestrinone significantly inhibited the growth of cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 43.67 (23.46∼81.32), 27.78 (12.51∼61.68) and 15.25 (7.17∼32.43) μmol/L at 20, 40 and 60h, respectively. Compared with control-treated leiomyoma cells, gestrinone significantly reduced both the expression of ERα (P<0.05) and the levels of phospho-Ser167-ERα (P<0.05). Gestrinone also markedly suppressed the level of phospho-Tyr416-Src (P<0.05). Moreover, gestrinone significantly increased the ratio of phospho-p38/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (P<0.05). However, no significant increase in apoptosis or cell cycle arrest was observed (P>0.05) in response to the tested concentrations of 0.1 to 3.0μmol/L. As a conclusion, gestrinone suppresses the proliferation of uterine leiomyoma cells mainly by regulating the activity of ERα/Src/p38 MAPK in a concentration-dependent manner at a low concentration of 0.1∼3.0μM, but not significantly regulating apoptosis. Gestrinone opposes the growth of uterine leiomyoma through multiple genes.",

        "abstract": "To effectively improve realistic and efficiency of visualization of wheat population, a real-time rendering algorithm based on multi-technology integration was developed for visualization of wheat population growth. Firstly, based on the rule of morphological formation of wheat population, differences between individual architectures in population were analyzed. Secondly, in order to improve rendering efficiency, level of detail (LOD) model was adopted, space dividing and selection of level of detail were decided by sight position, sight angle and sight line. View frustum culling was used to reduce the number of detecting point and improve speed of sigle point culling. Tree-structure display list was used to improve data strcture design. Thirdly, external reference and instance technology was used to improve realistic of visualization by generate several diffferent samples which would be used when wheat population were rendering. Finally, a simulation experiments for comparison showed that the rendering algorithm based on multi-technology integration improved efficiency of real-time visualization of wheat population, reduced memory requirement, the techologies for visualization of wheat population growth had a good performance on dynamic and realistic characteristics. These results are helpful for development of a visualization wheat growth system.",

The experimental results show that the bonding of graphite to copper can be performed by Ag-Cu-Ti filler metal in vacuum. The interfacial microstructure of the joint is graphite/TiC/Ag-Cu eutectic+Cu solid solution/Cu solid solution/copper. With increasing of the brazing temperature and holding time, TiC layer became thicker, but thickness of layer could not continuously increase. The maximum shear strength of the joint, which was brazed at 870°C for 15 min in vacuum, was up to 17 MPa. The brazed specimens fractures occurred at the graphite near the interface between graphite and filler metal.",

This novel method reduced the use of chemical reagents and thus reduced environmental pollution because no chemical hydride generation procedure was used. Under the same conditions, the hydride generation efficiency of BAECHG was 99. 0% - 101. 6% of that of chemical hydride generation method. Parameters and interference conditions were investigated. Under the selected conditions, the linear range was 0 - 120 (μg/L for arsenic (As, injection volume; 100 μL). The detection limit (signal to noise ratio of 3:1) was 0. 64 μg/L. The relative standard deviation (RSD) obtained by using standard solution with 60 μg/L of As was 2. 0% (n = 13). The proposed method was applied to analyze the reference soil sample (GBW07406), the result was consistent with the certified value. The spiked recoveries of piglet feed sample were 97. 0% - 103. 0%. High sensitivity and good repeatibility are the advantages of this method.",

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the clinical regimen rationality of intravenous cefazedone sodium in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by PK/PD study.Ten patients with mild to moderate CAP were enrolled to receive intravenous cefazedone sodium (2 g q12 h) for 7-14 days. Blood samples were collected in any day during day 5-7. Sputum specimens were collected before treatment for bacteria isolated, and susceptibility to cefazedone determined. PK-PD analysis was performed using the noncompartmental analysis of Phoenix WinNolin software (version 6.1, Pharsight Corporation, CA, USA). The maximal time above MIC (ƒT > MIC) was calculated, and its correlation with clinical efficacy was analyzed.All 10 patients completed the study and 8 of them were cured. Six strains were isolated from patients before treatment (one for each patient) and all susceptible to cefazedone. Five patients of six in culture positive group were cured. All pathogens were cleared at the end of therapy. The MICs were between 0.25 and 1 mg/L. The main PK parameters were C max 175.22 ± 36.28 mg/L; T½ 1.52 ± 0.23 h; AUC (0-∞) 280.51 ± 68.17 mg·L -1·h -1 ; CL 7.37 ± 1.84 L/h; Vd 16.06 ± 4.42 L. The average ƒT > MIC was 55.45 ± 8.12%.Intravenous injection of cefazodone sodium with 2 g q12 h dosage regimen is used in the treatment of CAP caused by sensitive bacteria, either ƒT > MIC or clinical efficacy shows that such dosing regimen is reasonable.",

        "abstract": "Separation of the influencing factors (climate, soil, variety, management) affecting crop yield could provide valuable insight into how crop responds to climate change and how crop yield can be enhanced in the future. In this study, we reported the changes of climatic conditions, soil nutrients, variety types and management practices in the Taihu region (a typical rice growing zone) of east China in two periods (the 1980s and the 2000s), and simulated the changes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields under different scenarios by using the APSIM-Oryza model. The contributions of the influencing factors in rice growing system were also calculated. The results revealed that there was a warming trend in the rice growing period in the Taihu region. However, the precipitation and sunshine hours in the rice growing season showed a decreasing trend in the past 30 years. Compared with the soil nutrients in the 1980s, the mean concentrations of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium in the 2000s in the Taihu region were increased by 15.85%, 79.55%, 124.55% and 10.37%, respectively. The rice varieties in the 1980s could be described as the 'panicle weight type', while in the 2000s as the 'panicle number type'. The differences in management practices between 1980s and 2000s were mainly attributed to the fertilization and irrigation methods. From the 1980s to 2000s, the average rice yield in the Taihu region increased by 46.3%. The individual contribution of the climate change, soil improvement, variety updating and management progress on rice productivity was estimated as -19.5%, 12.7%, 21.7% and 34.6%, respectively. In addition, the spatial variation of rice yields in the whole region was reduced from 13.7% to 7.4% with the soil fertility improvement. The results indicate that future adaptations to climate change for rice yields would require either enhanced tolerance to high temperatures in the existing rice varieties or change in the current management practices, while balancing the soil fertility is a continuing process. © 2013 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "There is a vital need to explore highly-efficient and stable nonprecious-metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reduce the overpotential and further improve the energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we report a unique and cost-effective lyophilized and thermal two step procedure to synthesize high-performance CoFe alloy nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets interspersed with carbon nanotubes (CoFe-N-CN/CNTs) hybrid. The lyophilization step during catalysts preparation is beneficial to uniform the dispersion of carbon-like precursors and avoid the agglomeration of metal particles. Meanwhile, the inserted CNTs and doped N in this hybrid provide better electrical conductivity, more chemically active sites, improved mass transport capability and effective gas adsorption/release channels. And all these lead to a high specific surface area of 240.67 m2 g-1, favorable stability and remarkable OER activities with an overpotential of only 285 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 51.09 mV dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is even superior to commercial IrO2 catalysts. The CoFe-N-CN/CNTs hybrid thus exhibits great potential as a highly efficient and earth-abundant anode OER electrocatalyst.",

In order to jam effectively the radar, the DRFM technique and the ways of time-shift, weighing and frequency-shift were adopted to produce immobile false targets, moving false targets, and false targets with a few moving parts, respectively. The simulation of jamming signals and echo signals via the signal processing with a certain ratio of energy and deception jamming in range and velocity were analyzed. As the jamming energy grows greater, the parameters of synthetic targets gets much closer to those of jamming targets, so the velocities and sites of the real targets are concealed, and a better jamming effect is obtained.",

        "abstract": "Rice ( L.) production is an important contributor to China’s food security. Climate change, and its impact on rice production, presents challenges in meeting China’s future rice production requirements. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of how rice yield responds to climate change under different scenarios and assessed the associated simulation uncertainties of various regional-scale climate models. Simulation was performed based on a regional calibrated crop model (CERES-Rice) and spatially matched climatic (from 17 global climate models), soil, management, and cultivar parameters. Grain-filling periods for early rice were shortened by 2–7 days in three time slices (2030s, 2050s, and 2070s), whereas grain-filling periods for late rice were shortened by 10–19 days in three time slices. Most of the negative effects of climate change were predicted to affect single-crop rice in central China. Average yields of single-crop rice treated with CO fertiliser in central China were predicted to be reduced by 10, 11, and 11% during the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s, respectively, compared to the 2000s, if planting dates remained unchanged. If planting dates were optimised, single-crop rice yields were predicted to increase by 3, 7, and 11% during the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s, respectively. In response to climate changes, early and single-crop rice should be planted earlier, and late rice planting should be delayed. The predicted net effect would be to prolong the grain-filling period and optimise rice yield.",

        "abstract": "With the wide use of online social networks (OSNs), the problem of data privacy has attracted much attention. Several approaches have been proposed to address this issue. One of privacy management approaches for OSN leverages a key management technique to enable a user to simply post encrypted contents so that only users who can satisfy the associate security policy can derive the key to access the data. However, the key management policies of existing schemes may grant access to unaurhorized users and cannot efficiently determine authorized users. In this paper, we propose a collaborative framework which enforces access control for OSN through an innovative key management focused on communities. This framework introduces a community key management based on a new group-oriented convergence cryptosystem, as well as provides an efficient privacy preservation needed in a private OSN. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we also discuss a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework. Experimental results show that our construction can achieve the identified design goals for OSNs with the acceptable performance. © 2010 ICST.",

The system consisted of a sample vessel, a lab-made membrane module and an ion chromatograph. Hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hollow fiber membrane was used in MBD which was directly performed in serum and urine samples to eliminate the matrix interferences and enrich fluoride, while enabling automation. The determination of fluoride in biological samples was carried out by IC with suppressed conductometric detection. The proposed method feasibly determined trace fluoride in serum and urine matrices with the optimized parameters, such as acid concentration, distillation temperature, and distillation time, etc. Fluoride exhibited satisfactory linearity in the range of 0.01-5.0mg/L with a correlation coefficient of 0.9992. The limit of detection (LOD, S/N=3) and limit of quantification (LOQ, S/N=10) were 0.78μg/L and 2.61μg/L, respectively. The relative standard deviations of peak area and peak height were all less than 5.15%. The developed method was validated for the determination of fluoride in serum and urine with good spiked recoveries ranging between 97.1-101.9%. This method also can be proposed as a suitable alternative for the analysis of fluoride in other complex biological samples.",

The ability of growing as cancer spheroids was observed with ultra-low attachment plates. The flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of putative tumor-initiating cell marker CD133 in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma Tca8113 cell line. The selective technique of immunomagnetic beads was applied to purify CD133 tumor cells, CD133 tumor cells were cultured and their ability of proliferation were observed in vitro.After 12 days, the result of single cell culture in vitro revealed that about 5.23% of cultured Tca8113 cells possessed the capacity of continue proliferation. The cells line fromed floating clusters with one week of passaging cells into non-adherent plates. Approximately 0.95% of cells in Tca8113 cell line expressed CD133. Compared with CD133- cells and control Tca8113 cells, CD133+ cells demonstrated increased proliferation capacity. The proportion of CD133 cells decreased in culture as days passed. The percentage of CD133+ cells decreased from 92.45% to 1.62% in twelve days' culture.Tumor stem cells have the character of heterogenity and lower proportion of CD133 but higher ability of proliferation, and the diferentiation in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma Tca8113 cell line in vitro, CD133 may be one of makers for tumor-initiating cell of human tongue squamous cell carcinoma Tca8113 cell line.",

With the hyper-spectral reflectance data from the wheat canopy under different nitrogen fertilization levels, this paper constructed the spectral indices (including the single wavelength, ratio spectral index, and normalized difference spectral index) simulated by satellite channels, and established the nitrogen estimation equations by quantifying the relationships between the simulated channels spectral indices and the leaf nitrogen index. The results indicated that the spectral indices based on NDVI (MSS7, MSS5), NDVI (RBV3, RBV2), TM4, CH2, MODIS1, and MODIS2 could be reliably used for estimating the leaf nitrogen content (LNC), with R2 over 0.60, and the spectral indices based on NDVI (PB4, PB2), NDVI (CH2, CHl1), NDVI (MSS7, MSS5), RVI (MSS7, MSS5), MODIS1, and MODIS2 could be accurately used for predicting the leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), with R2 greater than 0.86. Comparatively, NDVI (MSS7, MSS5) and NDVI (PB4, PB2) could be the more suitable spectral indices for predicting the wheat canopy LNC and LNA, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Grain protein content is an important index indicating wheat quality status,and non-destructive and quick assessment of grain protein content is necessary for cultural regulation and quality classification in wheat production. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships of grain protein content to ground-based canopy hyper-spectral reflectance and spectral parameters,and to derive regression equations for predicting grain protein content in winter wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) with canopy hyper-spectral remote sensing,by four field experiments with different wheat cultivars and nitrogen levels across three growing seasons,and by time-course measurements on canopy hyperspectral reflectance,plant dry weight,nitrogen content and grain protein content during the experiment periods in 20032006.In experiment one and four,two cultivars of Ningmai 9 and Yumai 34 were used as low and high protein types respectively.In experiment two,Yangmai 12 was added as medium protein type cultivar.In experiment three,the high protein type cultivar altered for Xuzhou 26,and medium type cultivar for Yangmai 10 and Huaimai 20.The results showed that the grain protein content at maturity in wheat increased with nitrogen rate promotion,and could be well estimated by plant nitrogen nutrition status such as leaf N content and leaf N accumulation at anthesis.The regression analyses between vegetation indices developed and leaf N nutrition indices such as leaf N content and leaf N accumulation indicated that several key spectral parameters could be accurately used to estimate the changes in leaf N status across different growth stages,nitrogen levels and growing seasons,e.g.,REPle and mND705 could be used to leaf nitrogen content,and SDr/SDb and FD742 to leaf nitrogen accumulation.The total predicting models on grain protein content at maturity were constructed based on canopy hyper-spectral parameters at anthesis by linking the above two models with leaf N nutrition as intersection in wheat.Testing of the predicting models with independent datasets indicated that the spectral indices of REPle,mND705,SDr/SDb,and FD742 could be used to accurately estimate grain protein contents in wheat.It can be concluded that the grain protein content at maturity in wheat could be predicted directly by key vegetation indices at anthesis,with more reliable estimation from mND705.",

A quantitative method was developed for the simultaneous determination of both contaminants in food by gas chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The analytes were purified and extracted by the matrix solid-phase dispersion extraction (MSPDE) technique with Extrelut NT. A coupled column (a 3 m Innowax combined with a 30 m DB-5 ms) was developed to separate both compounds efficiently without derivatization. Triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) was applied to suppress matrix interference and obtain good sensitivity in the determination of both analytes. The limit of detection (LOD) in the sample matrix was 5 μg kg(-1) for 3-MCPD or acrylamide. The average recoveries for 3-MCPD and acrylamide in different food matrices were 90.5-107% and 81.9-95.7%, respectively, with the intraday relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 5.6-13.5% and 5.3-13.4%, respectively. The interday RSDs were 6.1-12.6% for 3-MCPD and were 5.0-12.8% for acrylamide. Both contaminants were found in samples of bread, fried chips, fried instant noodles, soy sauce, and instant noodle flavoring. Neither 3-MCPD nor acrylamide was detected in the samples of dairy products (solid or liquid samples) and non-fried instant noodles.",

        "abstract": " Polymyxins are a last-line class of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant ; however, polymyxin resistance can emerge with monotherapy. Therefore, synergistic combination therapy is a crucial strategy to reduce polymyxin resistance.  This study conducted untargeted metabolomics to investigate metabolic responses of a multidrug-resistant (MDR)  clinical isolate, AB090342, to colistin and aztreonam alone, and their combination at 1, 4, and 24 h. Metabolomics data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics; metabolites showing ≥ 2-fold changes were subjected to bioinformatics analysis.  The synergistic action of colistin-aztreonam combination was initially driven by colistin via significant disruption of bacterial cell envelope, with decreased phospholipid and fatty acid levels at 1 h. Cell wall biosynthesis was inhibited at 4 and 24 h by aztreonam alone and the combination as shown by the decreased levels of two amino sugars, UDP--acetylglucosamine and UDP--acetylmuramate; these results suggested that aztreonam was primarily responsible for the synergistic killing at later time points. Moreover, aztreonam alone and the combination significantly depleted pentose phosphate pathway, amino acid, peptide and nucleotide metabolism, but elevated fatty acid and key phospholipid levels. Collectively, the combination synergy between colistin and aztreonam was mainly due to the inhibition of cell envelope biosynthesis via different metabolic perturbations.  This metabolomics study is the first to elucidate multiple cellular pathways associated with the time-dependent synergistic action of colistin-aztreonam combination against MDR . Our results provide important mechanistic insights into optimizing synergistic colistin combinations in patients.",

The whole morphogenesis model includes four submodels of leaf, stem, sheath and ear morphogenesis. The submodel of leaf morphogenesis can quantitatively describe the dynamics of leaf length, leaf shape, leaf area, leaf curve, leaf angle, leaf color and leaf senescence, and the stem morphogenesis submodel can simulate the dynamics of stem length and thickness. By integrating the existing wheat growth model WheatGrow, a morphogenesis model based wheat virtual growth system for organs and plant was developed with OpenGL on the platform of Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The system comprised of models, database and interface (or browser), in which the models included the morphogenesis model, growth model, visualization model and scene control model, and the database included the weather data, soil data and variety parameters. The operational results of the system show that the system can primarily realize the visual description of growth process of organs and single plant in wheat.",

The linearities of three components were excellent between detection limits and 10000 mg/L with correlation coefficients above 0.999. The SPR detector was applied to the liquid chromatography system. The RSD values were below 2.3% for separated samples with standard concentration solutions, it could detect the sucrose and galactose as low as 6 and 9 μg, respectively.

The column was prepared by thermally initiated radical polymerization of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) in a fused-silica capillary of 320 μm i.d. and modified by quaternary ammonium latex surface coating. Two C(4)Ds were placed near both ends of the capillary column and the output difference between them was measured. With 15 mM potassium hydrogen phthalate used as the eluent, good separation of a mixture of inorganic anions (F(-), Cl(-), NO(2)(-), NO(3)(-)) was achieved. The detection limits of conventional C(4)D are 1.6, 0.28, 0.53, and 0.47 mg L(-1) for F(-), Cl(-), NO(2)(-), and NO(3)(-), respectively. To further enhance the sensitivity, the capacitive impedance from C(4)D was neutralized by an inductive impedance from a piezoelectric resonator. An increase in sensitivity by a factor of 7-8 was achieved in the resonating C(4)D in comparison with the conventional C(4)D. The detection limits of the resonating C(4)D are 0.23, 0.041, 0.065, and 0.059 mg L(-1) for F(-), Cl(-), NO(2)(-), and NO(3)(-), respectively.

        "abstract": "Aims Crop canopy reflectance, especially derivative spectrum, is a promising prospect for nondestructive rapid estimation of crop photosynthetic organ area and evaluation of crop growth status and yields. The purpose of our experiment was to investigate the quantitative relationships between derivative spectral parameters and photosynthetic organ area.Methods We used field experiments to study leaf area index (LAI), pod area index (PAI) and canopy hyperspectra reflectance of rapeseed (Brassica napus) under different nitrogen levels and in different cultivars and determined quantitative relationships between derivative spectral parameters and photosynthetic organ area.Important findings The correlation coefficient between photosynthetic organ area and derivative spectra was higher than that of canopy spectral reflectance of single band, with the best correlation at 750 nm (r=0.9). The correlation sequence of \"three-edge parameters\" to photosynthetic organ area was red edge>yellow edge>blue edge, area parameters>amplitude parameters>position parameters. Phenomenon of \"two peak\" at red edge of rape canopy spectra weakened the sensitivity of red edge position (REP) to changes of biophysical parameters, but REP extracted from linear extrapolation method (REP(le)) strengthened it. Red edge area (SDr) and difference of SDr and blue edge area (SDb) (DSDr,b) from \"three-edge parameters\" and their derived parameters had the best correlation with LAI and PAI, and they were suitable for the different cultivars used in this study. Therefore, derivative spectral parameters, i.e., first derivative spectrum at 750 nm, SDr and DSDr,b could be used to effectively monitor area of photosynthetic organs in rapeseed.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the structural and functional relationships between these core regions.Based on the severity of their condition, 60 patients and 20 healthy controls were equally divided into four groups (mild group, moderate group, major group and health controls group), scanned by T1-MR, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). Structural image, BOLD image, and SWI image were collected for processing and analysis. The characteristics of the depression and controls were checked by analysis of variance test, and the difference between groups was checked by Dunnett's test.The volume of hippocampus and amygdala varied with the severity of the condition. The signal obtained under the stimulation of negative events was linearly decreased in the mild, moderate and major groups revealed by fMRI. The length and diameter of the lateral ventricle vein was reduced in the mild group, whereas the number of branches increased. In the moderate and major groups, the reduction in the length, diameter and increase in the number of branches of the lateral ventricle vein were greater.The alterations of the volume, fMRI, and cerebral veins in these core regions may account for the causal relationship between structure and function.",

The results show that the main phases of coating are TiC, (Ti,W)C, γ-Ni dendrite structure and M23C6 eutectic structure. The grain of TiC is fine, which size is about 1.5 μm, and distributes uniformly. The test results of micro-hardness and wear resistance show that the micro-hardness is improved about 4 times compared with that of the Q235 steel.

        "abstract": "Effects of potassium application rates(0,6,12,18 kg/667 m2 K2O) on plant potassium accumulation,distribution and utilization characteristics of different genotypes rice were studied by using conventional japonica cultivars(Wuyunjing7,Wuxiangjing14) and hybrid japonica cultivars(86you8,Siyou422).The resulted showed as follows.Both rice yield and harvest index were increased with the increment of potassium application,which they obtained the highest at the K2O application rate of 12 kg/667m2.Plant potassium accumulation and absorption percentage from elongation stage to maturing stage were raised,as well as average and maximal rate of potassium speediness accumulation period under potassium application,but starting to terminating date and duration date of potassium speediness accumulation period were opposite.Through potassium fertilizing,plant potassium absorption and the percentage of potassium accumulation from elongating stage to maturing stage were increased.Potassium application promoted potassium distribution amount in leaf,culm and sheath,panicle,and distribution percentage of culm and sheath,whereas reduced distribution percentage of leaf.The variation of potassium distribution amount in culm and sheath were larger than others.With the increment of potassium application rates,rice potassium recovery efficiency,plant potassium productivity and potassium utilization index decreased,potassium agronomy efficiency,physiology efficiency and physiology index increased at first and then decreased.Among these estimation index,the correlation of potassium physiology index and physiology efficiency to yield were higher.Rice yield,potassium absorption percentage from elongation stage to maturing stage,starting to terminating date and duration date of potassium speediness accumulation period,potassium physiology efficiency,potassium physiology index,and plant potassium productivity of conventional japonica cultivars were higher than those of hybrid japonica cultivars,however,potassium accumulation,potassium absorption percentage from transplanting stage to elongation stage,average and maximal rate of potassium speediness accumulation period,potassium distribution amount and percentage in culm and sheath,and potassium recovery efficiency were lower.",

        "abstract": "A simple method for the determination of betaine, l-carnitine and choline in human urine was developed based on column-switching ion chromatography coupled with non-suppressed conductivity detection by using a self-packed column. A pretreatment column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, i.d.) packed with poly(glycidyl methacrylate-divinylbenzene) microspheres was used for the extraction and clean-up of analytes. Chromatographic separation was achieved within 10 min on a cationic exchange column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, i.d.) using maleic anhydride modified poly(glycidyl methacrylate-divinylbenzene) as the particles for packing. The detection was performed by ion chromatography with non-suppressed conductivity detection. Parameters including column-switching time, eluent type, flow rates of eluent, and interfering effects were optimized. Linearity (r(2) ≥ 0.99) was obtained for the concentration range of 0.50-100 μg mL(-1) for betaine, 0.75-100 μg mL(-1) for l-carnitine, and 0.25-100 μg mL(-1) for choline. Detection limits were 0.12 μg mL(-1) for betaine, 0.20 μg mL(-1) for l-carnitine and 0.05 μg mL(-1) for choline. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision for all quality controls were within ±10.11%. Satisfactory recovery was observed between 92.5 and 105.0%. The validated method was successfully applied for the determination of betaine, l-carnitine and choline in urine samples from healthy people. This article is protected by copyright.

The preparation of gas chromatographic stationary phases with CNTs has been performed by packing method or in situ catalytic chemical vapor deposition. The deposition of CNTs on a chromatographic solid matrix (e. g. silica micro-particles or organic polymer microspheres) was carried out to generate a packing material for high performance liquid chromatography. Capillary monolithic columns for liquid chromatography were also prepared by embedding CNTs in polymer monolithic columns. Columns with CNTs have the unique advantages in the separation of aromatic compounds for the π electron system of CNTs. Herein, the recent applications of CNTs in the preparation of chromatographic stationary phases are reviewed, including gas chromatography and liquid chromatography. The future developments in this field are also prospected.",

Methods 171 clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae were identified and their drug sensitivities were determined by automatic VITEK-2 system. Results Streptococcus agalactiae were usually found in the samples of blood and urinary tract secretions. Some isolates were obtained from umbilical secretions. Most of the Streptococcus agalactiae isolates were found in the Department of Neonatology ward and to a lesser extent in obstetrics ward. The resistance of the 171 isolates to penicillin G and ampicillin was moderate. All isolates were sensitive to Vancomycin and Cephalosporin. The rate of drug resistance of the isolated Streptococcus agalactiae to tetracycline, clindamycin and erythromycin was 100% , 70.8% and 55.6% , respectively. Conclusion Constant monitoring can prevent the appearance of drug resistant Streptococcus agalactiae. Routine antibiotic susceptibility test may help the treatment of infection by Streptococcus agalactiae.",

        "abstract": "Rapid,accurate,and dynamic diagnosis of nitrogen nutrition status is essential for evaluating vigor,for predicting production rates,and for agricultural management of cultivated wheat.To determine the critical nitrogen concentration dilution curve for wheat,two field experiments with different levels of N application(0,75,150,225,300 and 375 kg/hm2) were conducted in Yizheng,China.According to the procedure in Justes′s curve,the dry matter and nitrogen concentrations under different nitrogen treatments could be compared by analysis of variance at the 5% probability level.Based on this curve,we developed a nitrogen nutrition index(NNI).In this index,when NNI=1,nitrogen nutrition was considered to be optimum,NNI>1 indicated excess nitrogen,and NNI<1 indicated nitrogen deficiency.We further investigated relationships between NNI and soil and plant analyzer development(SPAD) chlorophyll meter values and normalized differential SPADij(NDSPADij) values obtained at the top four leaf positions in wheat.We conducted a linear parallel curve analysis with grouped data to determine if the linear quantitative equation relating NNI to SPAD value or NDSPADij showed differences between varieties and/or years.The results showed that the curve had specific biological significance.The relationship between the critical nitrogen concentration and wheat dry matter could be described by the following negative power equations Y16: Ncnc=4.65DM-0.44 and N13: Ncnc=4.33DM-0.45.The critical nitrogen curves of the two cultivars of wheat had the same coefficient \"b\" but different coefficients \"a\".Y16 had a higher nitrogen accumulation capacity than N13.The NNI values ranged from 0.37 to 1.28,and increased with higher nitrogen application rates under the different nitrogen levels.The optimum nitrogen level was 150 kg/hm2 in 2009–2010,but was 225 kg/hm2 in 2010—2011.The SPAD values increased with increasing N application rates,and ranged from 34.3 to 52.8.In contrast,the NDSPADij value decreased with increasing nitrogen application rates,which showed that increasing amounts of nitrogen could decrease the differences in SPAD value among the top four single leaves of wheat.The NDSPADij values ranged from 0.01 to 0.143.The SPAD value at the top four single leaf positions were significantly positively related to NNI.The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.666 to 0.823.The strongest correlation was between the SPAD value at the top leaf(T1) and NNI,while the weakest correlation was between the SPAD value at the second leaf(T2) and NNI.A linear parallel curve analysis with grouped data approximated the relationship between SPAD and NNI and its differences between varieties and years.This will be useful for diagnoses of wheat nitrogen nutrition.In contrast,NDSPADij was significantly negatively related to NNI,except for NDSPAD12.The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.01 to-0.849.The strongest correlation was between NDSPAD14 and NNI,while the weakest correlation was between NDSPAD12 and NNI.A linear parallel curve analysis with grouped data demonstrated the relationship between NDSPAD14 and NNI(NNI=-2.019NDSPAD14+1.18,R=-0.838* *) stably across variety and year differences.This analysis could be used to assess NNI quantitatively and to diagnose wheat nitrogen deficiency quickly.",

Separation is based on differences in the stabilities of analyte-additive complexes in solution.Retention times of analytes can be varied over a large range by varying the additive concentration.The results indicate that the additives of proper concentrations can reduce the retention times of different organic acids while the resolution remains the same.The larger the molecular weight is,the greater the shift of the retention time is.This greatly expands the scope of macromolecular polar compounds that can be separated by ion-pair chromatography with the advantages of retention times being greatly reduced.",

Results: Decreases ofserum E2, P levels can be observed after treatments with high dose of gestrione, but similar findings were notobtained in low and middle dose groups. Lower receptor concentrations especially the concentration of ER werefound in ectopic endometrium than in eutopic endometrium. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that highand middle dose of gestrinone reduced the staining intensity of ER and PR in endometriotic and endometrial tissue.Conclusion: Gestrinone can decrease the levels of serum E2, P and reduce the expressions of ER, PR in botheutopic and ectopic endometriums, which maybe responsible for its treating effect on endometriosis.",

        "abstract": "The typical immiscible PP/PS blend based clay nanocomposites were prepared via melt blending. The dispersion of clay was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal stability and dynamic mechanical properties were measured by thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), respectively. Preferential intercalation behavior of clay in PP/PS blends was found. The dispersion of clay is significantly influenced by the polarity of PP and PS, meanwhile the location of clay can be controlled by the alternation of the polarity of PP and PS through chemical modification. The clay migrates from PS phase to PP phase with the improvement of the polarity of PP. However, when the PS is sulfonated, clay migrates back to the dispersed PS phase again. The dispersion and location of clay have profound influence on the thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of PP/PS blends. The better the dispersion of clay in either continuous phase or disperse phase, the higher the thermal stability of the blends. Besides, samples with clay located in the continuous phase can display the best strengthening effect. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

HCNSs were facilely quaternized through polycondensation of methylamine and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether. The quaternization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Owing to the electrostatic interaction, quaternized HCNSs were equably attached onto the surface of sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) beads to construct the anion exchangers. The aggregation was verified by scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis. Common anions, aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, polarizable anions, and aromatic acids were well separated on the stationary phases with good stability and symmetry. The prepared column was further applied to detect phosphate content in Cola drink samples. The limit of detection (S/N=3) was 0.09mg/L, and the relative standard deviation (n=10) of retention time was 0.31%. The average recovery was 99.58%.",

        "abstract": "Nursery nitrogen application has been used to improve seedling quality. The technique has received little attention with bare-root seedlings and their subsequent field performance on weed competition sites. Our research objective was to examine responses of one- and two- year-old bare-root Olga Bay hrch (Larix olgensis Henry) seedlings to nursery nitrogen supplements and subsequent one-year field performance on a competitive site. The fertilizer levels (kg N ha-1) were 0 (control), 60 (conventional fertilization, 60 C), 120 (additional nitrogen applied two times, 120 L), 180 (additional nitrogen applied three times, 180 L) and N were applied in increments of 30 kg ha-1 at 15-day interval to maintain a base nutrient leveL Although pre-planting morphological attributes and nitrogen status of one-year-old (la) seedlings were more sensitive to 60 C than for two-year-old (2a) seedlings, the conventional application failed to enhance their field survival(15.6% vs 17.8%), relative height growth (89.0% vs 79.6%), and relative diameter growth (17.0% vs 22.9%). The la seedlings' field survival (15.6% for 0,17.8% for 60 C) and 2a seedlings' relative height growth rate (11.0% for 0, 8.9% for 60 C) were not increased significantly until they were provided the 120 L (survival of 23.3% for la, relative height growth rate of 15.0% for 2a). According to pre-planting attributes and field performance, optimum nursery nitrogen application was 120 L for the 2a seedlings and 180 L for la seedlings. Except for component nitrogen concentration, pre-planting morphological attributes and component N content for the 2a seedlings were as much 3.3 to 37.7 times that of la seedlings. In conclusion, the contrasting survival of poor (15.6%-28.9%) for la seedlings and high (84.4%-91.1%) for 2a seedlings indicated that additional nitrogen fertilizer would not equal the benefits of an another year's growth in the nursery. Successful reforestation could not be fulfilled by la seedlings regardless of their pre-nutrients. An alternative technique for sites with competing vegetation was to apply 120kg N ha-1 in the nursery during July and August on 2a seedlings. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",

The chromatographic separation was performed on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 1.8 μm) using 0.08% (v/v) aqueous ammonia solution and acetonitrile having aqueous ammonia (0.08%, v/v) as mobile phases. The tandem mass spectrometer was operated using electrospray ion source (ESI) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The results showed that the linearities were in the range of 0.1-10.0 μg/L with the determination coefficients () greater than 0.9990 for chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and florfenicol. The limits of quantification (LOQs) (>10) in the blood samples were between 0.056 and 0.082 μg/L and the recoveries ranged from 90.0% to 105% at three spiked levels. Precision values expressed as relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1.2%-6.6%.

Based on this, the key spectral indices and the quantitative models for estimating soil organic matter (SOM) content were developed. After corrected with Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) and Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing methods, the spectral reflectance of near-infrared had an obviously high correlation with SOM, compared with the original spectral reflectance, while the corrected spectral indices of the first derivative values of the reflectance between two bands took the intermediate position. The correlation of the spectral indices with SOM was in the order of was DI > RI > ND, regardless the composition of the original spectral reflectance or the first derivative spectra. The DI, of the reflectance of near-infrared between 1883 and 2065 nm corrected with MSC and SG smoothing methods [ DI(CR1883 , CR 2065) ] had the best linear correlations with SOM. The test of the monitoring model based on DI( CR1883, CR2065 ) with the independent datasets of SOM showed that the R2 and RMSE validation values were 0. 837 and 4. 06, respectively. Comparing with the results from the Partial Least Square (PLS) method, the monitoring model based on DI (CR 1883, CR2065) was somewhat inferior. However, the DI (CR1883, CR2065) only needed two reflectance bands, and the monitoring model was simpler, being able to provide more available information for developing portable instruments, and a good spectral index for estimating SOM content.",

        "abstract": "Flavonoids are the active component of the Herba Epimedii (H. Epimedii), which is commonly used in Asia. This study is to investigate the effect of H. Epimedii on bone repair after anti-infection treatment in vivo. The bioactive-composition group of H. Epimedii (BCGE) contained four flavonoids with the total content of 43.34%. Rabbits with chronic osteomyelitis in response to injection with Staphylococcus aureus were treated with BCGE of 242.70 mg/kg/day intragastrically after vancomycin-calcium sulphate treatment. Micro-computerd tomography (CT), morphology, blood biochemistry and osteocalcin levels were assessed for effect evaluation. In addition, the rat calvarial osteoblasts infected with S. aureus were treated with vancomycin and BCGE. Cell viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, bone morphogenetic protein 2, Runt-related transcription factor 2, osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand mRNA levels and protein expression were assessed. Our results indicated that BCGE promoted bone repair via increasing the bone mass, the volume of bone, promoting osteocalcin secretion after vancomycin-calcium sulfate treatment. BCGE enhanced the cell proliferation, by regulating bone morphogenetic protein 2, runt-related transcription factor 2, and osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand mRNA and protein expression to maintain the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Therefore, BCGE is a potential adjuvant herbal remedy for the post-infection treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The influences of oscillating frequency and bulk concentration on the dilational properties were explored. The experimental results show that the linking spacer plays an important role in the interfacial dilational properties. The moduli pass through one maximum for all three gemini surfactants at both water-air and water-decane interfaces. However, the values of moduli at water-air interface are obviously higher than those at water-decane interface because the sublayer formed by spacer chains will be destroyed by the insertion of oil molecules. Moreover, with the increase of spacer length, the surface adsorption film becomes more viscous at high concentration, which can be contributed to the process involving the formation of sublaye...",

QA-Mag-CCNTs were applied in magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction (Mag-dSPE) for preconcentration of perchlorate from tea leaves prior to liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The Mag-dSPE procedure for preconcentration of perchlorate succeed in overcoming the flaw (containing target analyte randomly) of commercially available SPE cartridge. Under optimal conditions, the results showed higher extraction efficiency of QA-Mag-CCNTs, with recoveries between 85.2% and 107%. And the satisfactory precision with inter-day and intra-day RSD values were lower than 8.0%. Furthermore, QA-Mag-CCNTs were evaluated for reuse up to 20 times. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for perchlorate was 8.21 ng kg. The developed method was successfully applied in tea leaves for food-safety risk monitoring in Zhejiang province, China. The results showed the concentrations of perchlorate in 229 out of 240 collected samples were in the range of 0.082-988 μg kg. It was confirmed that QA-Mag-CCNTs were highly effective materials used for preconcentration of perchlorate.",

        "abstract": "Rice blast is one of the most devastating crop diseases around the world. Although previous remote sensing studies have examined the spectral variation at leaf and canopy levels in response to disease severity levels, the nonimaging nature of their data makes it difficult to examine the spectral variation related to the disease within a leaf. This study proposes to monitor the spatial and temporal pattern of rice leaf blast on individual leaves with close-range imaging spectroscopy data. Hyperspectral images were acquired from diseased leaves at different infection stages. The image data were converted to reflectance cubes and then processed with a model inversion algorithm PROCWT to retrieve leaf biochemical variables. The biochemical maps were examined to investigate the within-leaf spatial variation and leaf-level temporal variation. Preliminary results demonstrated that the PROCWT algorithm could perform on reflectance image cubes. The retrieved chlorophyll maps exhibited a decline with infection stage and significant within-leaf spatial patterns in response to the disease.",

        "abstract": "Aims Quantifying the relationship between red edge area parameter and canopy leaf nitrogen status is the foundation for real-time and non-destructive monitoring of crop growth status and precision nitrogen fertilization in rice (Oryza sativa). Our objectives were to analyze 1) characteristics of the first-derivative reflectance spectra in red edge area and 2) the quantitative relationship of red edge area shape parameters to canopy leaf nitrogen concentrations, using different nitrogen levels and rice varieties and based on canopy hyper-spectral reflectance of field-grown rice in different years. Methods Spectrum in the red edge area was significantly affected by different nitrogen levels and different rice varieties, and a \"three-peak\" feature could be observed with the first derivative spectrum at about 700, 720 and 730 nm. The maximum heights of the three peak bands changed with different nitrogen levels, so sub-areas surrounded by the first derivative spectra curve and x coordinate were formed by dividing the red edge area with the \"three-peak band line\". Two random sub-areas were selected to calculate ratio (double peak symmetry, DPS) and normalization (normalized double peak symmetry, NDPS), which were related to canopy leaf nitrogen concentrations. Important findings DPS based on the ratio of two different red edge sub-areas, and NDPS with normalization of the two different red edge sub-areas were significantly related to leaf canopy nitrogen concentrations in rice. Results of model calibration and validation indicated that DPS (A675-700, A675-755) and NDPS (A675-700, A675-755), ratio and normalized difference of areas in 675–700 to 675–755 nm red edge region, respectively, performed the best in estimating leaf canopy nitrogen concentration. Thus, these two spectral indices were suitable red edge area shape parameters for monitoring leaf canopy nitrogen concentrations in rice.",

        "abstract": "The quest for developing electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies continues to be a great impetus to develop cost-effective, highly-active and electrochemically-stable electrocatalysts for overcoming the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activation energy barriers. Co3O4 nanocrystals have great potential as OER catalysts, and research efforts on improving catalytic activity of Co3O4 are currently underway in many laboratories. Herein, we report the direct growth of CoFe LDH nanosheets on the active Co3O4 substrate to form nanohybrid electrocatalysts for OER. We find that the CoFe LDH/Co3O4(6:4) nanohybrid exhibits superior catalytic performance with a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope in alkaline solution. The outstanding performance of CoFe LDH/Co3O4(6:4) nanohybrid is primarily due to the synergistic effects induced by the strongly coupled interface between CoFe LDH and Co3O4, this feature endowed CoFe LDH/Co3O4(6:4) nanohybrid with synergistic effect in enhancing the intrinsic OER catalytic activity and favoring fast charge transfer. Compared to other Co3O4-based catalysts, our research shows certain advantages and offers a feasible avenue for improving the activity of Co3O4-based catalysts.",

        "abstract": "Plant nitrogen status is a key index for evaluating growth performance and yield and quality formation in crop plants.Non-destructive and fast assessment of N accumulation in leaves with remote sensing is of significant importance for accurate diagnosis and precise management of crop nitrogen nutrition.The present study investigated the quantitative relationships between leaf nitrogen accumulation and canopy reflectance spectra in rice(Oryza sativa L.) based on the data from the field experiments involving different cultivars and nitrogen levels in four years.Experiment one was designed with one cultivar,Wuxiangjing 9,and four N application levels of 0,135,240 and 405 kg/ha in 2001.Experiment two and three were both conducted with one cultivar,Wuxiangjing 9,and five N application levels of 0,75,150,225 and 300 kg/ha in 2002 and 2003.Experiment four included three cultivars(Wuxiangjing 9,Huajing 2,Nipponbare) with four N application levels of 0,105,210 and 315 kg/ha in 2004.Canopy spectral reflectance(4601 650 nm) date at jointing,booting,heading,filling and ripening stages of rice in the different field experiments were measured with MSR-16 multi-spectral radiometer,and corresponding N content and dry weight of leaves were also determined.Then the relationships of N accumulation in leaves to canopy reflectance of single band and all two-band combinations were analyzed.The results showed that the negative correlation was highly significant between leaf nitrogen accumulation and canopy reflectance at 460 nm,510 nm and 760(1 100) nm.The ratio,differential and normalized difference vegetation indices of several bands in near infrared(760(1 220) nm) and visible light(460710 nm) were all significantly and positively correlated with leaf nitrogen accumulation,among them the ratio vegetation index was the best.There were also highly significant correlations between leaf nitrogen accumulation and three other spectral parameters of λ_(rep),SAVI and OSAVI.Through step regression analysis on 15 better spectral parameters,the ratio vegetation index of R_(1100) and R_(560) [RVI(1 100,560)] was found to be the best one for predicting leaf nitrogen accumulation in rice.The derived equation,(LNA=)1.099×RVI(1 100,560)-2.4671,was tested with the data from two independent experiments.The RMSE values of all cultivars under different nitrogen levels were no more than 18%,indicating a good fit between the predicted and observed values of leaf nitrogen accumulation.It is concluded that the present spectral model is feasible and useful for estimating leaf nitrogen accumulation in rice with different cultivars and nitrogen levels.",

The results showed that with increasing bandwidth, the reflectance increased sharply at 720 nm and slowly at 990 nm, but decreased at 860 nm. The values of NDSI(R 860, R 720) and RSI(R 990, R 720) decreased gradually, along with reduced accuracy of calibration and validation for monitoring models. The monitoring models based on NDSI(R 860, R 720) displayed stable performance with the bandwidths of the key bands less than 96 nm and 28 nm, respectively, while those of RSI(R 990, R 720) less than 3 nm and 13 nm, respectively.

        "title": "Monitoring of wheat leaf pigment concentration with hyper-spectral remote sensing",
        "abstract": "In a two-year field experiment with wheat cultivars under different application rates of fertilizer N, the wheat leaf pigment concentrations were monitored with hyper-spectral remote sensing, and quantitative monitoring models were established. The results showed that the pigment concentrations in wheat leaves increased with increasing N application rate, and differed significantly among test cultivars. With the growth of wheat, the relative concentration of chlorophyll a + b varied more obviously than those of chlorophyll b and carotenoid (Car), and the sensitive bands of the pigments occurred mostly within visible light range, especially in red-edge district. The analyses on the relationships between eight existing vegetation indices and leaf pigment concentrations indicated that the concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and chlorophyll a + b were highly correlated with red edge position, and the relationships to REP LE were better than to REP IG, giving the determination coefficient R 2 as 0. 835, 0. 841 and 0. 840, and standard error SE as 0. 264, 0. 095 and 0. 353, respectively. However, the R 2 values between Car and different spectral indices decreased significantly, and the differences among the spectrum indices were very small. The tests of the monitoring models with independent datasets indicated that REP LE and REP IG were the best to predict leaf pigment concentrations. The R 2 of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a + b, and Car for REP LE were 0. 805, 0. 744 and 0. 588, with the RE being 9. 0%, 9. 7% and 14. 6%, respectively, and the R 2 and RE of chlorophyll b for REP IG were 0. 632 and 18. 2%, respectively. It was suggested that the red-edge parameters of hyper-spectral reflectance had stable relationships with the pigment concentrations in wheat leaves, and especially, REP LE could be used to reliably estimate the concentrations of leaf chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a + b.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the growing abuse of glyphosate herbicides in agricultural production has caused widespread accumulation of glyphosate in the environment, which is threatening the health or life of human beings and animals. To solve this problem, novel dendrimer grafted adsorbents were proposed for the rapid and efficient removal of glyphosate from water samples. These adsorbents were synthesized by grafting poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) onto poly(styrene-divinyl benzene-glycidylmethacrylate) beads. The morphological structure and chemical composition of the adsorbents were investigated by SEM, the BET method, FTIR spectroscopy, XPS and elemental analysis. Batch adsorption experiments were performed in glyphosate standard solutions with different pH, temperatures, and initial concentrations. Under the optimized conditions, adsorption equilibrium was attained rapidly within 5 min. Experimental data were correlated well with the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir model. The effect of temperature was also discussed by the thermodynamic parameters. Unlike other glyphosate adsorbents, their adsorption capabilities could be easily controlled by varying the generation of PAMAM dendrimer used. In addition, regeneration experiments showed that the adsorbents exhibited good reproducibility. When applied in the purification of contaminated drinking water, the removal efficiency of the adsorbents could be more than 95%.",

Driven by soil, variety, weather and management databases, a growth model-based decision support system for rapeseed management (GMDSSRSM) was developed by integrating growth simulation technology and component-based software technology, including a stand-alone edition (GMDSSRSM A) and a web-based edition (GMDSSRSM W). The GMDSSRSM A was established on the platforms of VC++ and VB by adopting the characteristics of object-oriented and component-based software and with effective integration and coupling of the growth prediction and decision-making functions for cultural management. Then, GMDSSRSM W was further developed on the platform of. net with C# language for web users. The implemented systems with the characteristics of powerful mechanism, good prediction, fine adaptability and comprehensive function realized the functions of data management, prediction of growth dynamics, evaluation of individual and comprehensive management strategies, real time growth data based simulation, time and spatial analysis, sensitivity analysis, expert consultation, and system help. The GMDSSRSM is regarded as quantitative and digital tools for prediction of rapeseed growth and development and decision support.

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral sensing can provide an effective means for fast and non-destructive estimation of leaf nitrogen (N) status in crop plants. The objectives of this study were to design a new method to extract hyperspectral spectrum information, to explore sensitive spectral bands, suitable bandwidth and best vegetation indices based on precise analysis of ground-based hyperspectral information, and to develop regression models for estimating leaf N accumulation per unit soil area (LNA, g N m −2 ) in winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Three field experiments were conducted with different N rates and cultivar types in three consecutive growing seasons, and time-course measurements were taken on canopy hyperspectral reflectance and LNA under the various treatments. Then, normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI) and ratio spectral indices (RSI) based on the original spectrum and the first derivative spectrum were constructed within the range of 350–2500 nm, and their relationships with LNA were quantified. The results showed that both LNA and canopy hyperspectral reflectance in wheat changed with varied N rates, with consistent patterns across different cultivars and seasons. The sensitive spectral bands for LNA existed mainly within visible and near infrared regions. The best spectral indices for estimating LNA in wheat were found to be NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ), and the regression models based on the above four spectral indices were formulated as Y = 26.34 x 1.887 , Y = 5.095 x − 6.040, Y = 0.609 e 3.008 x and Y = 0.388 x 1.260 , respectively, with R 2 greater than 0.81. Furthermore, expanding the bandwidth of NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) from 1 nm to 100 nm at 1 nm interval produced the LNA monitoring models with similar performance within about 33 nm and 23 nm bandwidth, respectively, over which the statistical parameters of the models became less stable. From testing of the derived equations, the model for LNA estimation on NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) gave R 2 over 0.79 with more satisfactory performance than previously reported models and physical models in wheat. It can be concluded that the present hyperspectral parameters of NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) can be reliably used for estimating LNA in winter wheat. Keywords Spectral analysis Sensitive hyperspectral bands Estimation indices Leaf nitrogen accumulation Wheat 1 Introduction Nitrogen (N) in cereal crops is a main element for maintaining growth status and enhancing grain yield. Leaf N accumulation (LNA), as a product of leaf N content and leaf weight, reflect not only information on leaf N status, but also vegetation coverage during crop growth. Therefore, quick, non-destructive and accurate acquisition of LNA becomes a key technique for population growth diagnosis and precision N management in modern crop production ( Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Song et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2006 ), which is of significant importance for precision diagnosis, real-time fertilization and productivity prediction. Research in the past decades has shown that remote sensing technology offers the only practical alternative to the complicated, slow and expensive chemical methods for estimating foliar chemical concentrations over large geographic areas ( Curran, 1989 ). Recently, the newly emerged hyperspectral sensing information, for example, from the field-based spectral radiometers like FieldSpec Pro FR2500 (Analytical Spectral Device, ASD) or from the Airborne HYMAP data (Integrated Spectronics, http://www.intspec.com ), has the features of high resolution (<10 nm) and continuous spectrum change at each pixel which can generate more band combinations and parameter type, and thus can precisely represent information on spectral reflectance as affected by chlorophylls, N compounds, and cellular structures, providing effective means for monitoring growth status and physiological parameters in crop plants ( Yoder and Pettigrew-Crosby, 1995; Blackmer et al., 1996; Lyon et al., 1998; Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006 ). So far, a number of spectrometric studies have been undertaken on plant N content monitoring ( Curran, 1989; Jensen and Lorenzen, 1990; Yoder and Pettigrew-Crosby, 1995; Blackmer et al., 1996; Tarpley et al., 2000; Kokaly, 2001; Huang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2007a, 2007b ). In contrast, less information is available on estimating plant N accumulation through remote sensing approach ( Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Huang et al., 2006 ), with several studies from the authors’ laboratory during the recent years ( Xue et al., 2004a, 2004b; Zhu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2008 ). The existing reports indicated that it is feasible to estimate plant N accumulation in plant by spectroscopic means, but some of which were based on the multi-spectrum with lower accuracy ( Xue et al., 2004a, 2004b; Zhu et al., 2006 ). Though hyperspectral sensing can improve the estimation accuracy on plant N status, only the existing sensitive spectrum indices were selected in most of research ( Huang et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2008 ), which can provide not only a little complex but limited band information. Additionally, proper feature bands and spectral indices may differ with crop types and experimental conditions, and some of the spectral parameters and estimation models may not be readily applicable for practical production and instrumental manufacture ( Xue et al., 2004a, 2004b; Zhu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2008 ). Therefore, further investigations are needed to explore consistent feature bands and construct simpler spectral parameters, and to develop more accurate monitoring models with wider applicability of crop N accumulation estimation based on hyperspectral sensing information. In analysis of plant spectral data for extracting characteristic information on target objects many methods have been adopted, including vegetation parameters, derivative algorithms, continuum-removal analysis, wavelet analysis, partial least squares regression, stepwise multiple linear regression, neural network and other derived functions, in an attempt to minimize background noise and enhance capacity of spectral information utilization and accuracy of estimating models ( Miller et al., 1990; Dawson and Curran, 1998; Kokaly and Clark, 1999; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2001; Gitelson et al., 2002; Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Huang et al., 2004 ). Among them, the vegetation parameters NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and RVI (ratio vegetation index) have been widely used for analyzing multi-spectral information in crop plants because they are constructed with simple form and for easy calculation, and can effectively reduce the influences of soil background and environmental noise ( Fernandez et al., 1994; Lyon et al., 1998; Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Xue et al., 2004a ). However, due to lack of effective means to analysis hyperspectral information, it is difficult to undertake a systematic quantification on all possible two bands combination of hyperspectral indices within the full range of 350–2500 nm ( Zhu et al., 2007a, 2007b; Wu et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2008 ), which might make precise feature bands of indicating the biochemical components in plants not fully explored and utilized. Apparently, a new comprehensive and precise hyperspectral sampling and analysis methodology is needed for exploring and identifying novel sensitive bands from the rich hyperspectral data for NDSI and RSI to establish applicable N monitoring model for modern crop production. Wheat is a main food crop in the world, and has been widely used in the previous investigations on growth monitoring with spectral reflectance ( Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Xue et al., 2004b; Zhu et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2008 ). Non-destructive monitoring of N nutrition indices in wheat plant would be useful for precise growth diagnosis and N saving management in agricultural production systems. Our present paper focused on the hyperspectral sensing from five different N rates and six wheat cultivars in three consecutive growing seasons would attempt to develop a new methodology for systematic exploration of novel sensitive bands and simple spectral indices to estimate LNA in wheat. Therefore, the objectives of this study addressed: (1) to construct a new method for determining the best band combinations for NDSI and RSI on the original and the first derivative spectrum in 350–2500 nm, (2) to quantify the relationships of LNA to NDSI and RSI and identify reliable regression models for estimating LNA, and (3) to evaluate the possible effect of bandwidth expansion on model performance in order to ascertain the appropriate bandwidth of sensitive wavebands for monitoring LNA. The anticipated findings, including a new approach, a series of N feature bands and several sets of monitoring models, would provide a technical basis for potential application of remote sensing technology to monitoring and diagnosis of plant N nutrition in wheat production, and be helpful for manufacturing an economic and portable nitrogen status spectrometer which is urgently needed in modern farming in China. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Design of field experiments Three field experiments were conducted at Nanjing area (118°42′E, 32°03′N) of China. The experimental factors included different N fertilization rates and cultivar types of winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) during three growing seasons. Each experiment was a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. For all the treatments, sufficient Ca (H 2 PO 4 ) 2 and KCl were applied at 150 kg ha −1 prior to seeding. Unless specified, cultural management followed local standard practices in wheat production. The data from Experiments 1 and 2 were mainly used for deriving the monitoring models, from Experiment 3 were mainly used for the model testing. The following provides more details about experiment design. Experiment 1 (Exp. 1): The experiment was undertaken at the experiment station of Nanjing Agricultural Bureau for the season of 2005–2006. The gleyed paddy soil contained 14.3 g kg −1 organic matter, 1.1 g kg −1 total N, 10.4 mg kg −1 available P, and 82.5 mg kg −1 available K. Two winter wheat cultivars, Ningmai 9 (N9) and Yumai 34 (Y34), were used to represent different grain protein contents at about 10% and 15%, respectively. Four N rates were applied as urea at 0 kg N ha −1 (N0), 90 kg N ha −1 (N1), 180 kg N ha −1 (N2) and 270 kg N ha −1 (N3). The N application was proportionally distributed in two splits: 50% prior to seeding and 50% at jointing. Seeds were sown on 16 November 2005 at the density of 180 plants m −2 , with the plot size of 27.5 m 2 area. The dates for obtaining spectral data and plant samples were 30 March (jointing), 11 April (booting), 20 April (heading), 29 April (anthesis), 6 May (8 days after anthesis, 8 DAA), 19 May, 24 May, and 2 June. Experiment 2 (Exp. 2): The experiment was undertaken at the experiment station of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences for the season of 2004–2005. The gleyed paddy soil contained 20.9 g kg −1 organic matter, 1.8 g kg −1 total N, 140.0 mg kg −1 available P, and 113.5 mg kg −1 available K. Three winter wheat cultivars, Ningmai 9, Yangmai 12 and Yumai 34, were used to represent different grain protein contents ranging from 9% to 15%. Four N rates were applied as urea at 0 kg N ha −1 (N0), 75 kg N ha −1 (N1), 150 kg N ha −1 (N2) and 225 kg N ha −1 (N3). The N application was proportionally distributed in two splits: 50% prior to seeding and 50% at jointing. Seeds were planted on 7 November 2004 at the density of 150 plants m −2 , with the plot size of 18 m 2 . The dates for obtaining spectral data and plant samples were 19 March (jointing), 13 April (booting), 26 April (anthesis), 6 May, 12 May, 20 May, 24 May, and 1 June. Experiment 3 (Exp. 3): The experiment was undertaken at the experiment station of Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences for the season of 2003–2004. The gleyed paddy soil contained 9.6 g kg −1 organic matter, 1.0 g kg −1 total N, 17.6 mg kg −1 available P, and 85.3 mg kg −1 available K. Four winter wheat cultivars, Ningmai 9, Yangmai 10, Huaimai 20 and Xuzhou 26, were used to represent different grain protein contents ranging from 9% to 14%. Five N rates were applied as urea at 0 kg N ha −1 (N0), 75 kg N ha −1 (N1), 150 kg N ha −1 (N2), 225 kg N ha −1 (N3) and 300 kg N ha −1 (N4). The N application was proportionally distributed in three splits: 60% at seeding, 20% at jointing and 20% at booting. Seeds were planted on 2 November 2003 at the density of 180 plants m −2 , with the plot size of 16 m 2 . The dates for obtaining spectral data and plant samples were 8 April (booting), 19 April (anthesis), 4 May (mid-filling). 2.2 Measurement of hyperspectral reflectance All canopy spectral measurements were taken using an ASD Field Spec Pro spectrometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO, USA). This spectrometer is fitted with a 25 field of view fiber optics, operating in the 350–2500 nm spectral region with a sampling interval of 1.4 nm and spectral resolution of 3 nm between 350 nm and 1050 nm, and 2 nm and 10 nm, respectively, between 1050 nm and 2500 nm. The measurements were carried out from a height of 1.0 m above the canopy (the height of wheat was 75–90 cm at maturity) and 0.44 m view diameter under clear sky conditions between 10:00 h and 14:00 h (Beijing local time). Measurements of vegetation radiance were made at 10 sample sites in each plot, with each sample from averaging 20 scans at an optimized integration time. The saved spectrum file contained continuous spectral reflectance at 1 nm step over the band region of 350–2500 nm. A panel radiance measurement was taken before and after the vegetation measurement by two scans each time. In each experiment, data were obtained at several major growth stages, as detailed in the previous experiment description. 2.3 Determination of LNA After each measurement of canopy spectral reflectance, an area of 0.25 m 2 (2 rows and 0.5 m long) of wheat plants from each plot was collected for determination of leaf dry weight and leaf N concentration. From each sample, all green leaves were separated from the stems, and oven-dried at 70 °C to constant weight, then weighed. The dried leaf samples were ground to pass through a 1-mm screen, and then stored in plastic bags for subsequent chemical analysis. The total N concentration in leaf tissues was determined by the micro-Kjeldahl method. LNA (g N m −2 ) was calculated as the product of leaf N concentration on dry weight basis (LNC, g 100 g −1 ) and leaf dry weight per unit ground area (LDW, g DW m −2 ). 2.4 Definition of normalized difference spectral index and ratio spectral index In the present study, all possible two bands combination of hyperspectral indices (NDVI and RVI) within the full spectral range of 350–2500 nm were constructed in the form of matrix linkage. This concept and underlying content is beyond the traditional definition of normalized difference vegetation index, thus a more adaptable and descriptive spectral index was named, i.e. normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) or ratio spectral index (RSI). Table 1 describes the algorithm of the spectral indices used in this study. 2.5 Construction of reduced precise sampling method With the hyperspectral metadata in the present study, a new method of reduced precise sampling was designed by integrating the reduced sampling and precise sampling to realize fast analysis and feature extraction from the observed data sets. Firstly, the reduced sampling method was adopted to construct normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI). In this procedure, the spectral reflectance data from Experiments 1 and 2 were read at the interval of 10 nm within the range of 350–2500 nm. With the duo matrix formulation, all possible NDSI and RSI based on any two individual bands at the interval of 10 nm in 350–2500 nm were regressed against LNA, including linear, power and exponential equations. According to the changing coefficients of determination ( R 2 ), the concentration map of R 2 was plotted with the contour. From this map, the sensitive spectral range with relative greater R 2 was identified. Then, the precise sampling was carried out to read the spectral reflectance at 1 nm interval of the sensitive range identified by the above reduced sampling method, and all possible NDSI and RSI were formulated and regressed with LNA in linear, power and exponential forms by linking the duo matrix. Based on R 2 and SE (standard error), and in consideration of spectral principle, the best feature bands and corresponding vegetation indices were determined. All these procedures for statistical analysis and contour mapping of R 2 and SE values were completed with self-programmed software based on MATLAB ( The MathWorks, 2000 ). 2.6 Testing of estimation model The data in Exp. 3 were used to test the derived model equations, and the estimated results were compared with the measurements to evaluate reliability and accuracy of the equation output under independent cultural conditions. Besides R 2 , the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and slope were used to evaluate the fitness between the predicted and observed data, along with 1:1 plotting of the two sets of values. The RRMSE is calculated with the following equation ( Zhu et al., 2006 ): RRMSE = 1 n × ∑ i = 1 n ( P i − O i ) 2 × 100 O ¯ i where P i and O i are the predicted and observed values, respectively. O ¯ i is the observed mean value, and n is the number of samples. Furthermore, the observed data from all three experiments in the present study were adopted to compare the performance of the monitoring models established in this study and proposed in the previous reports for LNA in wheat. This procedure would be helped to evaluate if the present models could be superior or similar to the previous models for monitoring LNA in wheat. 3 Results 3.1 Changes of LNA and hyperspectral reflectance 3.1.1 LNA The LNA range of the calibration dataset is from 0.09 g N m −2 to 11.60 g N m −2 , with the average of 4.31 g N m −2 and standard deviation of 3.01 g N m −2 . Similarly, the statistical parameters for validation dataset are 0.33–10.65 g N m −2 , 4.03 g N m −2 , and 2.37 g N m −2 , respectively. Taking the data from Exp. 1 as example, the results revealed that LNA over growth periods of two wheat cultivars increased with increasing N fertilization rate and the differences among the treatments varied with growth stages ( Fig. 1 ). Except for N0 treatment, the LNA first rose and then decreased over growth progress, with peak at booting or heading, consistent in two cultivars. From booting to anthesis, wheat plants grew vigorously with a high N demand, and thus LNA was significantly different among varied N rates. In addition, LNA at jointing was greater in Yumai 34 than in Ningmai 9, the opposite pattern was seen after booting. Overall, increased N rates enhanced LNA in wheat, but the increment changed with growth stages and cultivars. 3.1.2 Canopy hyperspectral reflectance With the data from Yumai 34 in Exp. 1 as example, Fig. 2 exhibits the dynamic change patterns of canopy hyperspectral reflectance with varied N rates at booting and with growth stages at N3. It can be seen that different N rates markedly influenced the characteristics of spectral reflectance of wheat canopy, with different spectral responses in the various waveband regions ( Fig. 2 A). With increasing N rates, the canopy spectral reflectance decreased in the range of visible bands, and elevated in the range of near infrared, with obvious differences among four N rates. This implied that these spectral regions are relatively sensitive to growth status of wheat under varied N levels. The similar spectral responses were observed at different growth stages, marked differences located in the visible and near infrared regions ( Fig. 2 B). This is likely because wheat canopy structure and plant biochemical components experienced sharp changes at different growth stages and under varied N rates, thus influencing the properties of spectral reflectance. As a whole, under higher N rates and more vigorous growth stages the canopy reflectance in the visible range was lower than under lower N rates and earlier growth stages, and the opposite pattern was seen in the near infrared region. 3.2 Spectral index and estimation model based on original spectrum 3.2.1 NDSI (R λ 1 , R λ 2 ) With the observed data from Exps. 1 and 2, the reduced sampling method was firstly adopted to analyze the functional relationships of LNA to NDSI at 10 nm interval from 350 nm to 2500 nm based on the original spectrum and to identify the sensitive band ranges with greater R 2 values. The regression analyses revealed that there were highly significant correlations between LNA and NDSI in two spectral ranges of visible bands and near infrared bands, whether the function was linear or power or exponential form. As seen from the contour map of R 2 with full wavelength, the R 2 values were largely greater than 0.80 with linear regression based on the NDSI of 710–730 nm and 930–1010 nm ( Fig. 3 A) , greater than 0.90 with power regression based on NDSI of 700–730 nm and 820–960 nm (figure omitted), and greater than 0.90 with exponential regression based on NDSI of 500–580 nm and 830–1010 nm (figure omitted). Then, through precise sampling on those sensitive spectral ranges, more detailed contour maps of R 2 values between LNA and NDSI at 1 nm interval were obtained in three different functional forms. According to R 2 and SE, it can be seen that among the selected NDSI groups, for linear equation the best performance was based on NDSI (R 968 , R 720 ) ( R 2 of 0.81 and SE of 1.31) ( Fig. 3 B), for power equation the best was from NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) ( R 2 of 0.90 and SE of 1.33) (figure omitted), and for exponential equation the best was from NDSI (R 940 , R 570 ) ( R 2 of 0.90 and SE of 1.20) (figure omitted). The above results indicated that the well-performed spectral indices and monitoring equations were all based on the sensitive bands from visible to near infrared ranges, whether derived from linear or non-linear equations. Among them, three NDSI models as linear, power and exponential functions exhibited exceptional predictability ( R 2 > 0.81, SE < 1.33), as seen in Fig. 4 . In particular, the power equation from NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and exponential equation from NDSI (R 940 , R 570 ) markedly enhanced the accuracy of LNA monitoring in wheat. 3.2.2 RSI (R λ 1 , R λ 2 ) Using the similar procedures, the contour maps of R 2 values for the relationships of LNA to RSI in full wavelength based on the original reflectance were firstly obtained through reduced sampling. The results showed that the greater values of R 2 were all from spectral bands located in visible and near infrared ranges, whether the regression was linear or non-linear form. The sensitive spectral ranges for linear regression were 900–1020 nm and 560–730 nm, with R 2 > 0.81 ( Fig. 5 A) ; for power function they were 700–1200 nm and 350–750 nm, with R 2 > 0.87 (figure omitted); for exponential function they were 500–750 nm and 750–1050 nm, with R 2 > 0.89 (figure omitted). Then, on the basis of these sensitive spectral ranges for each function type, the precise contour map was established according to R 2 values derived from each band. Among them, the RSI with 990 nm and 720 nm for linear equation was found to perform well for LNA prediction, with high R 2 (0.81) and low SE (1.16), as shown in Fig. 5 B. Similarly, the RSI based on 930 nm and 580 nm for power equation could effectively estimate LNA in wheat, with R 2 of 0.87 and SE of 1.26 (figure omitted), and the RSI from 710 nm and 890 nm for exponential equation gave best prediction performance, with R 2 of 0.89 and SE of 1.27 (figure omitted). These results indicated that, based on linear or non-linear equations, the identified sensitive spectral bands for RSI were almost located in the visible and near infrared ranges, similar to NDSI based on the original spectrum. Three monitoring models based on the RSI gave good prediction of LNA, with R 2 greater than 0.81 and SE lower than 1.30. Among them, the non-linear equations based on RSI (R 930 , R 580 ) and RSI (R 710 , R 890 ) had higher R 2 than linear equation based on RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), as seen in Fig. 6 . 3.3 Spectral index and estimation model based on derivative spectrum 3.3.1 NDSI (FD λ 1 , FD λ 2 ) After getting the first derivative value from the original spectral reflectance, the contour maps of R 2 values of the linear function, power function and exponential function for the relationships of LNA to NDSI (FD λ 1 , FD λ 2 ) in full wavelength at 10 nm interval were obtained through reduced sampling as described in the above procedures (figure omitted). The sensitive region combinations were found to be located in (721–756 nm and 676–711 nm), (681–696 nm and 551–601 nm) and (701–761 nm and 476–551 nm) for three function types, respectively, with R 2 > 0.77. Then, the precise contour maps were established according to R 2 values derived from all two-band combinations at 1 nm interval among the sensitive spectral ranges for three function types (figure omitted). NDSI (FD 753 , FD 691 ), NDSI (FD 691 , FD 571 ) and NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) were identified to be best spectral index for effective estimation of LNA in wheat, with R 2 of 0.80, 0.77 and 0.89, and SE of 1.38, 1.59 and 1.45, respectively ( Fig. 7 and Table 3 ). 3.3.2 RSI (FD λ 1 , FD λ 2 ) Using the similar methodology, the contour maps of R 2 values of the three kinds of functions were acquired for the relationships of LNA to RSI (FD λ 1 , FD λ 2 ) in full wavelength at 10 nm interval (figure omitted). On the basis of the R 2 values, the sensitive regions existed in 730–750 nm and 500–530 nm for the linear function with R 2 > 0.80, in 701–756 nm and 496–546 nm for power regression with R 2 > 0.85, and in 501–546 nm and 736–751 nm for exponential regression with R 2 > 0.81. Then, from the precise contour maps derived from all two-band combinations at 1 nm interval (figure omitted), it was found that RSI (FD 736 , FD 521 ), RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) and RSI (FD 532 , FD 750 ) all well estimated LNA, with R 2 > 0.81 and SE < 1.64 ( Fig. 8 and Table 3 ). 3.4 Bandwidth impact on spectral index and estimation model With the well-performed spectral indices NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), the bandwidths were expanded from 1 to 100 nm gradually at the interval of 1 nm, and then the corresponding LNA monitoring models with varied bandwidths were established based on the two spectral indices. Comparing the values of R 2 and SE of the calibration ( Fig. 9 A) , it can be seen that NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) exhibited similar change patterns. With the increased bandwidths, for NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) R 2 ascended firstly and then descended after 37 nm, although SE increased gradually; whereas for RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) R 2 and SE became less stable after 40 nm, with declining R 2 but increasing SE. Analyzing the bandwidth impaction on validation performance of NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) ( Fig. 9 B), the results showed that R 2 decreased but RRMSE increased gradually for NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ). However, for RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), R 2 descended fast while RRMSE rose with inflexion at 39 nm. In addition, slope increased gradually for NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), while for RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) it decreased first and then increased quickly, with the inflexion at the bandwidth of 39 nm. The LSD test on the difference between R calibration 2 and RRMSE validation was used to assess the bandwidth effect. The result displayed that the monitoring model exhibited apparent difference after the bandwidth of NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) is over 33 nm and 23 nm, respectively. 3.5 Testing of estimation models on LNA The independent dataset from Exp. 3 was used to test the six models for LNA estimation in wheat. Three statistics of R 2 , RRMSE and slope between the observed and estimated values were considered comprehensively for evaluating the performance of established models. It can be seen that the overall performance was excellent with all estimation models on LNA, although slightly weaker with the models from RSI (R 930 , R 580 ) and NDSI (FD 691 , FD 571 ). The monitoring models derived with NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) had the best performance, with R 2 of 0.83 and 0.85, RRMSE of 0.25 and 0.24, slope of 0.93 and 0.94, respectively ( Table 2 ). The models for LNA based on NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) gave good estimation accuracy, with R 2 of 0.81 and 0.79, RRMSE of 0.25 and 0.28, slope of 1.01 and 0.89, respectively ( Table 3 ). The 1:1 plotting with the observed and predicted values well exhibited the reliability and accuracy of the derived models, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 . It should be noted that the monitoring models based on the first derivative spectrum did not improve the model performance, as compared with the models based on the original spectrum. 3.6 Performance comparison of present models with previous models In order to see if the present estimation models could be comparable to the previously reported models for LNA in wheat ( Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Xue et al., 2004b; Zhu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2008 ), the observed data from all three experiments in the present study were adopted to compare the performance of the monitoring models established in the above procedure and proposed in the previous reports. The results from both model calibration and validation revealed that based on the present study the overall performance was more stable and reliable in this paper ( Table 4 ). Especially, the models based on NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) gave enhanced accuracy and stability in estimating LNA in wheat, with a simplified and applicable formulation. 3.7 Performance comparison of present models with physical base models In order to see if the present estimation models could be better than the physical base models for LNA in wheat, we developed simple physical base models using the reflectance peaks and absorption vales following the method from Kokaly and Clark (1999) and three (red, yellow, blue) edge parameters from calibration datasets ( Table 5 ). According to our sample features and previous experience, we adopted the reflectance peaks of 560 nm, 920 nm, 1100 nm, 1280 nm, 1690 nm and 2230 nm, and the absorption vales of 670 nm, 980 nm, 1190 nm and 1450 nm for the different feature bands, respectively. Then, the models were tested with independent data from validation datasets, in comparison with the selected spectral indices ( Table 6 ). The results exhibited that the Area 670 and Derivative Red edge position had the better performance than the other parameters with R calibration 2 over 0.724, R validation 2 over 0.774, and RRMSE less than 0.299. As compared with the best vegetation index models on NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ), and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ), the physical base models did not give a better performance in estimating LNA in wheat. 4 Discussion Monitoring crop N status has been a main research field in crop remote sensing and precision management. LNA is a synthetic reflection of leaf N content and leaf weight in wheat, and thus is considered as a key indicator for plant N diagnosis and growth estimation, further for prediction of grain yield and quality index ( Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Zhu et al., 2006 ). In the present research, we have designed a new approach of reduced precise sampling for estimating LNA by the spectroscopy technology. By adopting the method of reduced precise sampling, a series of novel wavelengths (516 nm, 526 nm, 720 nm, 725 nm, 736 nm, 860 nm, 990 nm) were identified, and four sets of new sensitive spectral indices NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) were determined, which generated corresponding regression models ( Y = 26.34 x 1.887 , Y = 5.095 x − 6.040, Y = 0.609 e 3.008 x and Y = 0.388 x 1.260 ) for reliably estimating LNA in wheat. The present results help to lay a technical foundation for non-destructive monitoring and precision diagnosis of plant N nutrition, and provide possible core bands for manufacturing ground-based N monitoring device as well as extracting useful information from satellite and air-borne remote sensing in wheat production. Selection and exploration of new key wavebands is an important technology in the area of vegetation remote sensing and has been performed in a number of cases ( Blackburn, 1998; Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003 ). Minimizing the background impact would be helpful for extracting the in-depth band information. Several methods have been suggested to reduce background noise, including vegetation indices, derivative analysis, continuum-removal analysis and statistical method like partial and modified partial least squares (MPLS) and stepwise regression ( Blackburn, 1998; Kokaly, 2001; Huang et al., 2004; Gupta et al., 2003; Cho and Skidmore, 2006 ). Recently, some studies have extracted hyperspectral information characterized with metadata property only at some particular bands corresponding to the previously reported sensitive bands or index formulations in an attempt to establish best spectral index and monitoring model ( Wu et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2008 ). To address the metadata of hyperspectra, the present study has developed the novel method of reduced precise sampling by integrating the reduced and precise sampling, with a matrix form in self-programmed software under MATLAB 7.0. This procedure has realized effective extraction of spectral features and fast discovery of new sensitive bands from hyperspectral information in plant. This can be considered as a comprehensive and useful research means for precise data analysis and band selection on hyperspectral remote sensing for plant growth status and biochemical component. From the new designed approach, the present study found seven sensitive bands (516 nm, 526 nm, 725 nm, 720 nm, 736 nm, 860 nm, 990 nm) for indicating LNA in wheat. That is to say, the best bands for indicating the LNA lie in the regions of visible and near infrared range. The bands of 516 nm and 526 nm in the visible range are often strongly absorbed by plant chlorophyll and carotenoid for photosynthetic production, and thus can be considered as representative spectral bands of photosynthesis in green plants ( Xue et al., 2004b ). The bands of 725 nm, 720 nm and 736 nm lie in the region of red-near infrared transition, in which the red edge position (REP) shifts to longer or shorter wavelengths. This shifting has been used for estimating the changes in chlorophyll content ( Horler et al., 1983; Clevers et al., 2002 ), in relation to plant N status ( Yoder and Pettigrew-Crosby, 1995 ). The bands of 860 nm and 990 nm, located in the near infrared region, are sensitive indicators for healthy status of green leaves, and can be used for predicting the potential differences in photosynthesis and growth ( Xue et al., 2004b ). Thus, these key bands should be new additions to the reported band choices for monitoring N status in crop plants. It has been reported that the LNA in wheat is closely related to the linear combination of reflectance at 660 nm and 545 nm, independent of N fertilization treatments ( Fernandez et al., 1994 ), whereas the LNA in rice is well regressed against the linear combination of R 620 and R 760 , independent of cultivar types ( Shibayama and Akiyama, 1986 ). The multi-spectral investigations in crop plants by the authors’ laboratory indicated that the multi-spectral indices of RVI (R 810 , R 560 ) and RVI (R 1100 , R 560 ) could monitor LNA in rice ( Xue et al., 2004a; Zhou et al., 2006 ), whereas the spectral indices of NDVI (R 1220 , R 710 ) and RVI (R 1220 , R 660 ) could monitor the LNA in wheat ( Xue et al., 2004a; Zhu et al., 2006 ), applicable to different main growth stages. The recent studies with hyperspectral analysis revealed that the monitoring models derived from the hyperspectral indices SDr/SDb, FD 742 and AVHRR-GVI could give a reliable estimation of LNA in wheat under different cultural conditions ( Feng et al., 2008 ). Yet some of these spectral parameters are based on the broad wavebands with low accuracy or on hyperspectral bands with complex formulation, and thus hard to be put into practical use for development of ground-based monitoring device. In this paper, we constructed new and simple hyperspectral indices of NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ), RSI (R 990 , R 720 ), NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) and RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ). The vegetation index (NDSI and RSI) composed of the visible and near infrared bands should be able to well reflect photosynthetic capacity and growth characteristics in crop plants, as well as monitor the N nutrition status in plant tissues ( Lyon et al., 1998; Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003 ). As a result, the derived models ( Y = 26.34 × NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) 1.887 , Y = 5.095 × RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) − 6.040, Y = 0.609   e 3.008 × NDSI   ( F D 736 , F D 526 ) and Y = 0.388 × RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) 1.260 ) from the visible and near infrared ranges are simple and applicable, with reasonable explanation from the principle of remote sensing. As compared with the models based on the original spectrum, the performance of the models based on the first derivative spectrum hardly improved. This indicated that the derivative spectrum cannot be expected to enhance extraction efficiency of target information under all circumstances. Identifying proper bandwidth with key spectral indices could be important for designing the ground-based growth monitoring device. In developing countries including China, reducing the cost of fertilization and manufacturing the cheap device for N estimation are of great significance for N saving management in crop production. In the present study the models based on the varied bandwidths showed that if the core bands of NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) and RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) were less than 33 nm and 23 nm bandwidth, respectively, the performance was generally good for LNA estimation in wheat. Furthermore, the statistics changed slightly for NDSI, but sharply for RSI, likely because the normalized algorithm reduces the relative difference, while ratio algorithm enlarges the relative difference. These results imply that for manufacturing the portable device for estimating LNA, we can use 720 nm and 860 nm or 990 nm wavelengths with feasible bandwidth to obtain an excellent performance in wheat. Different vegetation indices may have their specific adaptation conditions. The NDVI is a sensitive indicator of green vegetation, yet becomes less sensitive when the vegetation coverage is beyond 80% ( Cao et al., 2005; Jia and Liu, 2006 ). Thus, the spectral parameters in the form of NDVI are more proper for remote monitoring of the vegetation with relatively low coverage. In contrast, the RVI, considered as another sensitive indicator of green vegetation, is more proper for monitoring vegetation growth with relatively high coverage ( Cao et al., 2005; Jia and Liu, 2006 ). The present results have shown that the estimation range of LNA tends to be narrower for NDSI (R 860 , R 720 ) (1.22–9.50 g N m −2 ) than for RSI (R 990 , R 720 ) (0.15–9.82 g N m −2 ), and for NDSI (FD 736 , FD 526 ) (0.16–7.52 g N m −2 ) than for RSI (FD 725 , FD 516 ) (0.28–9.52 g N m −2 ), but with similar accuracy and precision. Therefore, in practical use proper N monitoring models can be flexibly selected according to the specific growth stages and vegetation coverage of field wheat so that the model types are alternative and applicable. However, these estimation models exhibited a trend of slight saturation under excess N levels, and thus have a potential to down-estimate LNA in wheat grown under high N supply. Although this excess N fertilization seldom occurs in agricultural production practice, future attention should be paid to explore additional hyperspectral indices applicable to a wider range of N levels in wheat plants. As compared to multi-spectral index, hyperspectral index can markedly enhance the estimation accuracy of several growth parameters in vegetation remote sensing ( Hansen and Schjoerring, 2003; Feng et al., 2008 ), but sometimes appear to be over-sensitive. Therefore, in quantitative analysis of hyperspectral remote sensing it is necessary to provide diverse training samples, and increase the amount, complexity and representation of samples so that the derived model can be applied under varied conditions. The field experiments in this study involved six wheat cultivars and five N fertilization rates in three consecutive growing seasons, which carries a large number of samples and rich information with good representation. As a result, the present hyperspectral indices NDSI and RSI, and their derived estimation models gave reliable performance in predicting LNA of wheat. Yet it should be noted that since this study was conducted only at one ecological area, the adaptation and reliability of the present monitoring models need to be tested under other ecological environments. This would make them more useful for non-destructive monitoring and precise diagnosis of plant N nutrition during wheat production.

The column was CarboPac PA10,the mobile phase was 26 mmol/L NaOH solution,the flow rate of mobile phase was 0. 6 mL/min,the detection potential was 0. 68 V,the standard curve of spectinomycin was rectilinear in the range of 0. 12 12 mg/L ( r = 0. 9991) and 12 280 mg/L ( r = 0. 9995) . Without pre-and post-column derivatization,this method can be used to simultaneously determine the main component and impurities in spectinomycin pharmaceutical raw material. Ease of preparation,being applied in DC detection mode and good catalytic stability confirmed the interests of this modified electrode as amperometric sensor for the determination of spectinomycin.",

        "title": "MONITORING LEAF DRY WEIGHT AND LEAF AREA INDEX IN WHEAT WITH HYPERSPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING",
        "abstract": "Aims Biomass and leaf area index (LAI) are important parameters for indicating crop growth potential and photosynthetic productivity in wheat. Non-destructive, quick assessment of leaf dry weight and LAI is necessary for growth diagnosis and cultural regulation in wheat production. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships of leaf dry weight and LAI to ground-based canopy hyperspectral reflectance and spectral parameters and to derive regression equations for monitoring leaf dry weight and LAI in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) with hyperspectral remote sensing. Methods Three field experiments were conducted with different wheat varieties and nitrogen levels for three growing seasons, and time-course measurements were taken on canopy hyperspectral reflectance and leaf dry weight and LAI during the experiments. Experiment one was conducted in 2005?2006 to construct a monitoring model with four N rates of 0, 90, 180 and 270 kg·hm–2 using cultivars ‘Ningmai9’ and ‘Yumai34’ (low and high protein types, respectively). Experiment two was un-dertaken in 2004?2005 to construct a monitoring model with four N rates of 0, 75, 150 and 225 kg·hm–2 using cultivars ‘Ningmai9’, ‘Yangmai12’ and ‘Yumai34’ (low, medium, high protein types, respec-tively). Experiment three was conducted in 2003?2004 to test a monitoring model with four N rates of 0, 75, 150, 225 and 300 kg·hm–2 using cultivars ‘Ningmai9’, ‘Huaimai20’ and ‘Xuzhou26’ (low, medium, high protein types, respectively). Important findings Leaf dry weight and LAI in wheat increased with increasing nitrogen rates and with significant differences between stages of growth. The dynamics of leaf dry weight and LAI during growth exhibited single peak patterns. The sensitive spectral bands were located mostly within red light and near infrared regions, with correlation coefficients <–0.60 in 590~710 nm and >0.69 in 745~1 130 nm. The regression analyses between existing vegetation indices and leaf dry weight and LAI revealed that some key spectral parameters could accurately estimate changes in leaf dry weight and LAI across a broad range of stages of growth, nitrogen levels and growing seasons, with unified spectral parameters for each growth parameter. Among them, regression models based on RVI (810, 560), FD755, GMI, SARVI (MSS) and TC3 produced better estimation of leaf dry weight and LAI. Testing of the monitoring models with an independent dataset indicated that the spectral indices of RVI (810, 560), GMI, SARVI (MSS), PSSRb, (R750-800/R695-740)-1, VOG2 and mSR705 gave accurate growth estimation under the ex-perimental conditions. Overall, leaf dry weight and LAI in wheat could be monitored by key vegetation indices, with more reliable estimation from RVI (810, 560), GMI and SARVI (MSS).",

        "title": "Coupling remotely sensed information with a rice growth model by combining updating and assimilation strategies",
        "abstract": "Coupling remote sensing (RS) with a crop growth model can improve the prediction accuracy of crop modeling at a regional scale. In this paper, a new coupling method was developed based on a combination of the updating and assimilation strategies. The optimized model was used to estimate rice grain yield at both the field and regional scales. Firstly, parameterization for regionalization of the integrated RiceGrow model was accomplished with the use of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimization algorithm. Management parameters included sowing date, sowing rate and nitrogen rate. Then, analyzed values of model variables, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), which simultaneously served as the assimilation and updating parameters, were calculated based on the Ensemble Square Root Filter (EnSRF) and used to update the corresponding values simulated by the RiceGrow model. Finally, the growth status and final yield were simulated by the integrated model. This integrated technique was tested on independent datasets acquired from three rice field tests in different years for different rice varieties and at different treatments with regards to nitrogen rates and sowing densities. This was in addition to data obtained from study areas in Yizheng and Rugao counties in Jiangsu Province (in central eastern China), both of which are main production areas of high-quality rice in China. The test results showed that simulated values based on the integrated model were closer to the measured values than those simulated directly by the RiceGrow model, which produced RMSE values of 0. 94 for LAI, 0. 47 g/ m2 for LNA and 320. 15 kg/ hm2 for grain yield. The compared to RMSE values of 1. 25, 1. 24 g/ m2 and 516. 83 kg/ hm2 for these respective parameters based on the RiceGrow model alone, and 1. 01, 0. 59 g/ m2 and 335. 70 kg/ hm2 for the RiceGrow model based on the assimilation strategy. The newly developed integrated technique also performed well at a regional scale and the predicted results were consistent with the temporal and spatial distribution of rice growth status and grain yield, with relative error (RE) values of <20% for both growth parameters and the grain yield. This error may have been due to the limited simulation ability of the RiceGrow model, or generated during the RS information extraction and the statistical RS estimating models, all of which need improvement. These results indicated that there are certain non-determinacy factors for the RiceGrow model when used at the regional scale, such as spatial variability in the soil and management parameters. However, the integrated technique based on combining RS and the RiceGrow model could reduce this problem. Therefore, this study provides an important step towards the more routine use of combined RS and crop modeling techniques to improve our ability to estimate regional rice grain yield predictions.",

        "abstract": "Non-destructive monitoring of leaf nitrogen (N) status can assist in growth diagnosis, N management and productivity forecast in field crops. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships of leaf nitrogen concentration on a leaf dry weight basis (LNC) and leaf nitrogen accumulation per unit soil area (LNA) to ground-based canopy reflectance spectra, and to derive regression equations for monitoring N nutrition status in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four field experiments were conducted with different N application rates and wheat cultivars across four growing seasons, and time-course measurements were taken on canopy spectral reflectance, LNC and leaf dry weights under the various treatments. In these studies, LNC and LNA in wheat increased with increasing N fertilization rates. The canopy reflectance differed significantly under varied N rates, and the pattern of response was consistent across the different cultivars and years. Overall, an integrated regression equation of LNC to normalized difference index (NDI) of 1220 and 710 nm of canopy reflectance spectra described the dynamic pattern of change in LNC in wheat. The ratios of several near infrared (NTR) bands to visible light were linearly related to LNA, with the ratio index (RI) of the average reflectance over 760, 810, 870, 950 and 1100 nm to 660 nm having the best index for quantitative estimation of LNA in wheat. When independent data were fit to the derived equations, the average root mean square error (RMSE) values for the predicted LNC and LNA relative to the observed values were no more than 15.1 and 15.2%, respectively, indicating a good fit. Our relationships of leaf N status to spectral indices of canopy reflectance can be potentially used for non-destructive and real-time monitoring of leaf N status in wheat.",

        "abstract": "Four independent field experiments with 6 wheat varieties and 5 nitrogen application levels were conducted, and time-course measurements were taken on the canopy hyperspectral reflectance and leaf N accumulation per unit soil area (LNA, g N x m(-2)). By adopting reduced precise sampling method, all possible normalized difference spectral indices [NDSI(i,j)] within the spectral range of 350-2500 nm were constructed, and the relationships of LNA to the NDSI(i,j) were quantified, aimed to explore the new sensitive spectral bands and key index from precise analysis of ground-based hyperspectral information, and to develop prediction models for wheat LNA. The results showed that the sensitive spectral bands for LNA were located in visible light and near infrared regions, especially at 860 nm and 720 nm for wheat LNA. The monitoring model based on the NDSI(860,720) was formulated as LNA = 26.34 x [NDSI(860,720)](1.887), with R2 = 0.900 and SE = 1.327. The fitness test of the derived equations with independent datasets showed that for wheat LNA, the model gave the estimation accuracy of 0.823 and the RMSE of 0.991 g N x m(-2), indicating a good fitness between the measured and estimated LNA. The present normalized hyperspectral parameter of NDSI(860,720) and its derived regression model could be reliably used for the estimation of winter wheat LNA.",

The expression of NF-kappaB p65 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampus were detected by immunohistochemistry. The content of GFAP in cortex was tested by Western-blot. The content of TNF-alpha in cortex was tested by ELISA. The expression of IL-1beta mRNA was tested by RT-PCR.The expression of NF-kappaB p65, GFAP and TNF-alpha as well as IL-1beta mRNA were decreased by meloxicam.Meloxicam can reduce the proliferation of astrocyte by decreasing the expression of GFAP in AD model rat's hippocampus and cortex. And the depression of NF-kappaB p65 may significantly decrease the expression of TNF-alpha1 and IL-1beta to lessen the inflammatory reaction in cerebral tissue.",

Aiming at this problem, we propose SMPC-based smart contract platform with three-layer structure: contract, computing, and group communication layer. In contract layer, we put forward SMPC-based smart contract framework, which gives the implementation process, language structure and grammar specification of smart contracts. In computing layer, fair SMPC algorithms based on general linear secret sharing scheme are designed to implement verifiable collaboration computing with input privacy and computation correctness. In group communication layer, the non-blocking broadcast is developed from non-blocking message passing interface (MPI)in order to ensure secure group communication in asynchronous networks with node and link failures. Finally, the results of simulation experiments with private currency transfers indicate that our platform is efficient and secure enough for common smart contracts.",

Dispersion of C60 in the PP matrix was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy (OM). TGA and DSC results showed that the presence of C60 could remarkably enhance the thermal property and cone calorimeter measurements suggested that C60 could to some extent reduce the flammability of PP, with a significant reduction in peak heat release rate and a much longer time to ignition. Furthermore, the larger the loading level of C60, the better the flame retardancy property of PP/C60 nanocomposites. The flame retardation mechanism and corresponding model were proposed with the help of rheological measurements, TEM and x-ray diffraction. C60 reduced the flammability of PP by trapping free radicals in the gas phase and in situ forming a gelled-ball crosslink network to improve the flame retardancy of PP in the condensed phase. Finally, this suggested mechanism was supported by the results of advanced rheological extended systems (ARES), gel content, infrared spectrum, OM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",

At the last follow-up, the incidences of severe acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) and extensive chronic GvHD (cGvHD) were 14.0% and 20.0%, the 3-year cumulative incidence of transplantation related mortality (TRM) and relapse rate were 16.8%±6.1% and 21.3%±6.7%, and the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the patients were 64.6%±5.4% and 56.5%±5.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that age older than 40 years, HLA mismatch, and severe lung infection within the first 100 days after transplantation were risk factors for severe aGvHD, age older than 40 years, HLA mismatch, severe lung infection within the first 100 days after transplantation, and severe aGvHD were risk factors for TRM, high-risk AL and lack of cGvHD were risk factors for relapse (all P<0.05). Survival estimation showed that HLA mismatch, severe lung infection occurring within the first 100 days post-transplantation, high-risk AL severe aGvHD and lack of cGvHD were risk factors associated with poor prognosis (all P<0.05). Further multivariate analyses revealed that severe lung infection within the first 100 days post-transplantation, severe aGvHD and lack of cGvHD were independent risk factors for unfavorable outcomes (all P<0.05).Allogeneic HSCT can improve the DFS of AL patients, and severe lung infection within the first 100 days post-transplantation, severe aGvHD and lack of cGvHD are independent risk factors affecting the prognosis.",

Methods: The patients received oral fludarabine 40 mg/(m2.d) for 5 consecutive days, each treatment lasting 4 weeks. The efficacy was assessed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for response. Results: Twenty-two patients received the treatment, a median of 4 cycles per patient. The rate of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and overall response (OR) was 40.9% (9/22), 45.5% (10/22), and 86.4% (19/22), respectively. Among the 17 previously untreated patients, 7 (41.2%) achieved CR and 8 (47.0%) achieved PR. Two of the 5 pre-treated patients achieved CR and the other 2 achieved PR. During a median observation of 24 months, the overall survival rate was 81.8%. The main adverse reactions were myelosuppression and infection. Grade 1 to 3 granulocytopenia was found in 7 (31.8%) patients, and infection in 3 (13.6%) patients. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. All the adverse reactions were reversible. Conclusion: The oral fludarabine is effective, safe, and well-tolerated in the patients with CLL/SLL.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】Carbon and nitrogen metabolism in crop plants reflects plant physiological status and growth activity,and provides physiological basis for yield and quality formation in wheat. Thus,non-destructive and quick assessment of soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio is necessary for growth diagnosis and nitrogen management in wheat production. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships between leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio and ground-based canopy hyper-spectral reflectance and spectral parameters,and to derive regression equations for monitoring leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with canopy hyper-spectral remote sensing.【Method】Three field experiments were conducted with different wheat varieties and nitrogen levels across three growing seasons,and time-course measurements were taken on canopy hyperspectral reflectance and leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio during the period of experiment. Then,regression analyses were made on the relationships between leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio and canopy hyper-spectral reflectance and spectral parameters.【Result】 The results showed that the soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio in wheat leaves decreased with increasing nitrogen rates,taking on the trends of high-low-high pattern with growth stages. The proper time for monitoring leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio should be from jointing to mid-filling,with best stage as anthesis. FWBI and Area980 of water-index were highly correlated with leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio,with the determination of coefficients (R2) as 0.762 and 0.768 (exponential),respectively,and the standard errors (SE) as 1.27 and 1.28,respectively. (R750～800/R695～740)-1 and VOG2 of pigment-index were also significantly related to leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio,with R2 as 0.718 and 0.712 (exponential),respectively,and SE as 1.87 and 1.95,respectively. Thus,the exponential equation with some sensitive water-index and pigment-index as variables could well describe the dynamic change patterns in estimating the leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio in wheat,with better performance in water-index than in pigment-index. Testing of the monitoring models with independent dataset indicated that FWBI,Area1190,(R750-800/R695-740)-1 and VOG2 were the best indicators to estimate leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio,with the predictive precision (R2) of 0.627,0.618,0.691 and 0.795,respectively,the relative error (RE) of 19.2%,18.7%,17.9% and 18.3%,respectively.【Conclusion】Overall,the soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio in wheat leaves could be estimated by vegetation indices based on spectral characteristics related to water and pigment absorption,and FWBI,Area1190,(R750-800/R695-740)-1 and VOG2 could be used for reliably estimating the leaf soluble sugar to nitrogen ratio in wheat leaves.",

By taking advantage of the improved phase ratio of OT capillary with the immobilization of MCM-41 mesoporous material, the cellulose derivative of CDMPC as the chiral selector was simply coated on the MCM-41 nanoparticle layer via the hydrogen-bonding interaction, and the enantioseparation was successively carried out. Eight pairs of acidic, neutral and basic enantiomers were resolved in capillary electrochromatography or capillary liquid chromatography mode. The concentration of CDMPC for coating was systematically investigated to obtain the optimized chromatographic properties on enantioseparation by controlling the supposed film thickness of CDMPC on MCM-41 nanoparticle layer. Comparing with a bare fused silica capillary column coated with CDMPC under the same coating procedure as MCM-41-modified capillary did, the MCM-41-modified capillary column offered much higher enantioselectivity. This result indicated the significance of using the mesoporous nanoparticles as the electrochromatographic support to enhance the phase ratio of OT capillary column in capillary electrochromatography and capillary liquid chromatography. For investigating the effect of experimental conditions on the enantioseparation with this prepared OT capillary column, the content of organic modifier acetonitrile in the mobile phase was thus extensively evaluated to achieve a better chiral separation.",

Before applying LAI estimation model built at local scale to the regional scale, the mismatch between multi-scale sensors should be corrected. We firstly applied the kernel-driven BRDF model to describe the two-dimensional reflection characteristics of Landsat 5-TM data based on the kernel weights from MODIS MCD43A1 products and the angle vectors obtained from TM Collection 1 Level-1 dataset. Then the point spread function (PSF) was used to simulate the spatial response of the sensor. Results show that there is a good agreement between TM observations and corrected MODIS values (Red band:  $mathrm{R}^{2}= 0.736, text{RMSE}=2.65mathrm{e}-4$ , Near-infrared band:  $mathrm{R}^{2}=0.539, text{RMSE}=5.39mathrm{e}-4$ ). If we apply the LAI estimation model that has been validated at local scale (TM) directly to the data at large scale (MODIS) without any correction, more than 50% uncertainty of LAI estimation would be introduced. This study implies that the estimation of LAI in winter wheat could be significantly improved by correcting the differences between multi-scale sensors.",

A sensitive and rapid method was developed for the analysis of tobramycin and vancomycin in human drainage tissue fluid. The procedure involved a simple liquid-liquid extraction of tobramycin, vancomycin and atenolol (internal standard) and separation by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid water solution and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid acetonitrile solution at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Detection was performed by positive ion electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode (m/z 468 → 163 transitions for tobramycin; m/z 725 → 144 for vancomycin; m/z 267 → 74 for the internal standard). The retention times of tobramycin, vancomycin, and the internal standard were 0.68, 3.62 and 3.03 min, respectively. The total analysis time was less than 10 min. Excellent linear relationships (correlation coefficient > 0.99) were demonstrated between the area under the peak ratios of tobramycin and vancomycin to the internal standard in the drainage tissue fluid, and the concentration ranges were 1.25-100.00 mg/L and 0.50-150.00 mg/L for tobramycin and vancomycin, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision (coefficient of variation) acceptance criteria for each quality control was ≤ 7.8% and the mean accuracy values were < 5.0% for tobramycin and < 4.0% for vancomycin. All experiments suggested the high-throughput potential of the proposed method. The method was successfully applied to investigate local delivery of tobramycin and vancomycin in four calcaneal osteomyelitis patients who had accepted drug-loaded artificial bone implantation.",

Five CML patients were enrolled in experimental group, five healthy persons were used as control. BMMSCs were cultured in vitro. The morphology of BMMSCs was observed every day and the growth curve were portrayed, and the ability of cell proliferation were detected according to the daily results of cell counting. Total RNA was extracted from third and fourth passages of BMMSCs, The expression of integrins mRNA of BMMSCs were measured by real-time PCR. The results showed that the BMMSCs of experimental and control groups had no difference in growth characterisctics, but the expression of integrins mRNA of the BMMSCs was higher in CML patients than in normal control group (p < 0.05). It is concluded that the abnormally high expression of integrins of BMMSC from the CML patients take part in pathogenesis of CML.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of estrogen and androgen on the prostate in castrated rats.Methods 148 male SD rats were selected and randomly divided into 37 group:35 groups of different estrogen/androgen ratios,control and castrated control groups.The rats in groups of hormonal administration received different doses of estrogen/androgen,and the control groups were injected isotonic sodium chloride for one month.24 h after last injection,blood samples were collected,the rats were killed and the prostate glands were taken for measurement.Results In all the rats which received 0.02,0.5,2.5 or 12.5 mg testosterone propionate(TP)each,the degree of prostatic hyperplasia did not show a negative correlation with the dose of benzestrofol.When the dose of TP was 0.10 mg per rat,the prostate volume and coefficient were increased along with the increasing dose of benzestrofol.But in rats receiving benzestrofol in a dose of 50 μg/kg,the prostate hyperplasia was no longer increased along with the increasing dose of benzestrofol.Conclusions Estrogen exerts a marked effect on the growth of prostate only in the presence of androgen.Estrogen does not always manifest an anti-androgen effect on the prostate hyperplasia,but to a certain extent,it may promote the prostatic hyperplasia in synergy with androgen.",

An integrated regression equation could be used for describing the dynamic change pattern of leaf nitrogen concentration with hyperspectral parameters in different varieties,growing stages and nitrogen levels in cotton.These results provide a technical approach for monitoring plant nitrogen status and guiding precision nitrogen management in cotton production.",

        "abstract": "Field experiments were conducted in Nanjing in 2007 and 2008, involving two rice cultivare and three nitrogen application rates. The plant morphology and spatiotemporal distribution of PAR at different canopy heights were measured at filling stage with SunScan canopy analysis system. Nitrogen application rate had significant effects on the plant height, panicle curvature, and leaf angle of rice. The leaf area was greater in mid canopy than in upper and basal canopy. The maximum leaf area index ( LAI) layer appeared at 0. 60 of relative canopy height. The average PAR transmittance decreased from top to bottom in rice canopy, exhibiting a quick attenuation within the upper and mid canopy and a slow reduction within the basal canopy. In addition, the average PAR transmittance at different canopy heights decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate. The diurnal variation of average PAR transmittance was greater at noon than in the morning and afternoon. With increasing LAI accumulation, the average PAR transmittance at different canopy heights decreased in an exponential pattern. The diurnal variation of population extinction coefficient ( K) was smaller at noon than in the morning and afternoon, and the K value was in the range of 0. 35-0. 50. The 3dimensional distribution of PAR in rice canopy indicated that the PAR transmittance on horizontal plane was greater, and exhibited much more light flecks in upper and mid canopy than in basal canopy. The PAR density distribution at the same canopy height was non-uniform on the horizontal plane. Higher PAR transmittance, greater diurnal variation of PAR transmittance, and smaller population extinction coefficient were observed for the erect plant type rice cultivar.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) content is an important basis for the precise management of wheat fields. The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in agriculture provides an easier and faster way to monitor nitrogen content. Previous studies have shown that the features acquired from UAVs yield favorable results in monitoring wheat growth. However, since most of them are based on different vegetation indices, it is difficult to meet the requirements of accurate image interpretation. Moreover, resampling also easily ignores the structural features of the image information itself. Therefore, a spectral-spatial feature is proposed combining vegetation indices (VIs) and wavelet features (WFs), especially the acquisition of wavelet features from the UAV image, which was transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain with a wavelet transformation. In this way, the complete spatial information of different scales can be obtained to realize good frequency localization, scale transformation, and directional change. The different models based on different features were compared, including partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), and particle swarm optimization-SVR (PSO-SVR). The results showed that the accuracy of the model based on the spectral-spatial feature by combining VIs and WFs was higher than that of VIs or WF indices alone. The performance of PSO-SVR was the best (R = 0.9025, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.3287) among the three regression algorithms regardless of the use of all the original features or the combination features.

Methods We conducted three field experiments with different years, wheat varieties and nitrogen rates and determined time-course near-infrared absorbance spectroscopy and total nitrogen content from fresh and dry wheat leaves. The methods of partial least squares (PLS), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and wavelet neural network (WNN) were used to establish the calibration models, and a dataset selected at random was used to evaluate the established models. Important findings Near infrared calibration models based on PLS, BPNN and WNN could be used to estimate nitrogen content in wheat leaves with high precision and stable performance, especially WNN.The validation results showed that the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for the power model are 0.147,0.101 and 0.094, respectively,while those for the fresh leaves model are 0.216, 0.175 and 0.169, respectively. The correlation coefficients (R2) for all models are >0.84.Therefore,near-infrared spectrometry can be an efficient method to estimate the nitrogen nutrition of crops.",

It has been evaluated in PRiME (process, robustness, improvements, matrix effects, ease of use) pass-through cleanup procedure for human plasma prior to analysis of strychnine and brucine by liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Comparing with the magnetic carboxyl-graphene (Mag-CG), EH-Mag-GO is much more effective for the removal of matrix effect resulted from blood phospholipids. Under optimal conditions, the results show higher cleanup efficiency of EH-Mag-GO with recoveries in the range of 89.4%-118%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for strychnine and brucine are 0.088 μg/L and 0.092 μg/L, respectively. Especially, the EH-Mag-GO is also evaluated for reuse (20 times) without much sacrifice of the cleanup efficiency. Validation results on linearity, specificity, accuracy and precision, as well as on the application to analysis of strychnine and brucine in six cases of suspected semen strychni poisoning demonstrate the applicability to clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Background and Aims Nitrogen accumulation in cereal crops is a key parameter for assessing plant growth status and predicting grain yield and quality. Non_destructive monitoring and diagnosis of plant nitrogen status is necessary for precise nitrogen management. The present study was conducted to determine the quantitative relationships of leaf nitrogen accumulation to canopy reflectance spectra in both rice and wheat crops. Methods Ground_based canopy spectral reflectance and nitrogen accumulations in leaves were measured in six field experiments consisting of five different rice cultivars, three different wheat cultivars and varied nitrogen levels across six growing seasons. All possible ratio vegetation indices (RVI), difference vegetation indices (DVI) and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) of sixteen wavebands from the MSR_16 radiometer were calculated. Analyses were made to determine the relationships of seasonal canopy spectral reflectance and all possible vegetation indices to leaf nitrogen accumulations in wheat and rice under different nitrogen treatments and cultivars. Key Results As expected, nitrogen accumulation in rice and wheat leaves increased with increasing nitrogen fertilization rates. The relationship with canopy reflectance, however, was more complicated. In the near infrared portion of the spectrum (760-1 220 nm), canopy spectral reflectance increased with increasing nitrogen supply, while in the visible region (460-710 nm), canopy reflectance decreased with increasing nitrogen supply. For both rice and wheat, leaf nitrogen accumulation was best evaluated at 810 and 870 nm. Among all possible RVIs, DVIs and NDVIs, RVI(870,660) and RVI(810,660) were most highly correlated with leaf nitrogen accumulation in both rice and wheat. In addition, the correlations of RVI(870,660) and RVI(810,660) to leaf nitrogen accumulation were found to be higher than that of individual wavebands at 810 and 870 nm in both rice and wheat. Conclusions This study indicated that leaf nitrogen accumulation in both rice and wheat can be monitored with common wavelengths and spectral parameters. In addition, the integrated regression equation could be used to describe the dynamic pattern of change of leaf nitrogen accumulation in both rice and wheat with reflectance spectra parameters, although separate regression functions slightly enhanced prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This investigation was conducted to determine the quantitative relationship between leaf stomatal conductance and canopy spectral reflectance of rice crops under different water and nitrogen regimes. Results showed that leaf stomatal conductance on main stem leaves under different water treatments decreased in the following order throughout the growth cycle: GsL1 > GsL2 > GsL3 > GsL4. The leaf stomatal conductance in the high nitrogen treatment was higher than in the low nitrogen treatment when the soil water content was above W3. Below W3, there were no significant differences in leaf stomatal conductance between the high and low nitrogen treatments. It also was found that the correlation between the ratio index R(1 650, 760) and stomatal conductance averaged over different layer leaves was the following: GsL1 > GsL12 > GsL123 > GsL1234 > GsL2 > GsL3 > GsL4 (GsL1, GsL2, GsL3, GsL4, GsL12, GsL123 and GsL1234 denoted the first, second, third, fourth leaf and two leaves, three leaves, four leaves from top). The best relationship was between canopy stomatal conductance (the product of GsL1 and LAI) and R(1 650, 760). The ratio index R(1 650, 760) showed a power relationship with both stomatal conductance of L1 and canopy leaf stomatal conductance with an RMSE of 0.05 and 0.24, respectively. It was concluded that the ratio index R can be used to monitor leaf stomatal conductance during different growth stages of rice.",

Currently chemotherapies are frequently associated with treatment-related death and long-term side effects. Therefore, alternative approaches with lower toxicity are highly desired. Ginsenosides and metabolites are the main ingredients responsible for the multiple pharmaceutical functions of ginseng, which is one of the most commonly consumed herbal medicines world widely. In the present study, we demonstrated that compound K, a major ginsenoside metabolite, inhibited the growth of the clinically relevant pediatric AML cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This growth inhibitory effect was attributable to suppression of DNA synthesis during cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed significant G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by compound K. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by DNA double strand breaks. Our findings suggest that as a low toxic natural reagent, compound K could be a potential drug for pediatric AML intervention and to improve the outcome of pediatric AML treatment.",

        "abstract": "Soil total nitrogen content is regarded as an important index for soil fertility diagnosis and crop growth management direction, the rapid monitoring model and establishing optimum bands on soil nitrogen content is the key to swiftly obtain soil nutrient information and develop precision agriculture. Five types of soil (Paddy soil, Fluvo-aquic soil, Salinized fluvo-aquic soil, Saline soil, Dark soil with lime concretion) collected from the middle and eastern of China were measured in the near-infrared region (4 000-10 000 cm-1). According to molecular vibration characteristics of full spectrum in the near infrared region, 8 wave bands (the whole region, combination region, the first overtone region, the second overtone region including the combination of bands referred above, and the protein functional group bands) were designed for establishing calibration models adopting multiplicative scatter correction(MSC) method. The calibration models for nitrogen content in soil samples were established by Partial Least Square (PLS) regression. The results showed that the prediction effect using MSC spectra in the combination region of 4 000-5 500 cm-1 was the best, the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) for the calibration model were 0.90 and 0.16, respectively. Testing of the monitoring models with independent data of different types of soil samples indicated that determination coefficient and RMSE of validation were 0.91 and 0.15, respectively; RPD was 3.40. So, near-infrared diffuse reflection spectroscopy analysis technology can swiftly estimate total nitrogen content, and taking the combination band (4 000-5 500 cm-1) as modeling regional can get better calibration effect.",

Two field experiments were carried out at Yancheng suburb on May 3, 2006, according to the pass time of IRS-P6 satellite-the plat form placed on the LISS4. Some correlation analyses between wheat nitrogen status and wheat canopy spectra information from the LISS4 image were made in this paper. The results showed that both wheat leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) have good correlation with the LISS4 different wavebands reflectance and vegetation indices RVI, NDVI, GNDVI. Among the different wavebands reflectance and vegetation indices, the band4 reflectance was most closely related to wheat nitrogen status in this study. Test results also indicated that LISS4 satellite image could be used to monitor wheat nitrogen status. This research offered theory basis for monitoring nitrogen status and precision management in large area wheat production using remote sensing technology.",

Numerous previous researchers estimated LNC on reflectance spectrum or active chlorophyll fluorescence techniques with certain limitations. This study proposed a new technique of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) for detecting LNC. We conducted an experiment to determine the optimal measurement point at the leaf scale for SIF and the best fluorescence yield indices (FY indices) extracted from SIF for LNC detection. The differences of the upward and downward FY indices were compared to determine the optimal FY indices. The results showed that the 1/3 distance from the leaf base is the optimal position for measuring SIF at the leaf level, and the downward FY indices are much better than the upward one with ratio peak FY687/FY739 as the best to monitor the LNC. The findings demonstrated that SIF can be utilized as a potential method for monitoring the LNC of winter wheat with higher efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Phthalate esters (PAEs) are a group of serious environmental pollutants, which lead to carcinogenicity or tumorigenicity in human body. In this study, a rapid, sensitive and green method by graphene oxide coated hollow fiber membrane extraction (GO-HFME) coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was proposed for the determination of 11 phthalate esters in bottled beverages. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared and coated onto a porous hollow fiber membrane (HFM) to reinforce the efficiency of membrane extraction. The modified hollow fiber membrane was employed for the extraction of phthalate esters from bottled beverages prior to the determination by the supercritical fluid chromatography with UV detection. To achieve the maximum extraction efficiency, several parameters were investigated including GO concentration, extraction time, desorption solution and desorption time. SFC variables including stationary phase, modifier composition and percentage, column temperature, flow rate and backpressure were studied to improve the separation conditions. Under these optimized conditions, all the studied 11 phthalate esters were well separated and simultaneously determined in 7 min by SFC. The performance of the developed method was evaluated. Good linearity was observed (R ≥ 0.999) in the range of 0.02-10.0 μg/mL with limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 ng/mL. Recoveries of all the PAEs for the spiked samples were between 92.1% and 99.3% with satisfactory relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 5.9%. The proposed method is time-saving, green, simple and robust, which will be an alternative way to the analysis of PAEs in real samples.",

        "abstract": "Modern plant breeding needs to monitor the growth and evaluate the yield potential for an accurate selection in a great number of breeding lines. The hyperspectral reflectance technology has been demonstrated to be potential in meeting this kind of requirement with a simple, fast and nondestructive technology. Thirty soybean cultivars from Middle and Lower Yangtze Valleys with close growing days to maturity were chosen and tested in a randomized blocks design experiment during the two consecutive years. The measurement of above-ground dry biomass (ADM) and leaf area index (LAI) was synchronized with the information collection of the canopy hyperspectral reflectance by using a portable spectroradiometer (FieldSpec Pro FR2500, Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder, Co., USA) at three different growth stages (R2, R4, and R5) in soybean. Significant differences in ADM, LAI and plot yield among the tested cultivars were detected, which allowed a further regression analysis of the traits on the hyperspectral reflectances. There existed significant correlations between hyperspectral reflectance in the visible and infrared region and LAI, ADM, and yield, respectively. In particular, the highest correlations were observed at R4 and R5 stages. Based on a large number of spectral parameters in the literature, we selected the regression models with the best accuracy for ADM, LAI, and yield prediction. Among them, the regression model of LAI at R5 on P_Area560 and that of ADM at R4 on V_Area1450 were the best ones with their determination coefficients of 0.582 and 0.692, respectively. There was no single spectral index found foryield prediction. But the multiple regression of yield on NPH1280 at R2, V_Area1190 at R4 and NPH560 at R5 was found to provide a best yield prediction with R 2 =0.68. The obtained results suggested that hyperspectral remote sensing for monitoring growth status and estimating yields in soybean is feasible and potential, providing that a more accurate and stable regression model is searched based on an enlarged testing program under multiple environments. It might be especially useful and valuable for early generation yield prediction in a large-scale breeding program.",

Accordingly, this study improves the existing spatio-temporal interpolation method and succeeds in interpolating wheat yield data observed and recorded by 56 agro-meteorological stations on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China. In this study, pre-interpolation is first implemented to improve the completion rate of interpolation and eliminate the effect of absent neighboring values on the positions to be interpolated. Then, data reconstruction is performed in spatial and temporal dimensions based on spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Finally, the reconstructed results are combined with the back propagation (BP) neural network model for spatio-temporal integration. Moreover, this study analyzes the settings of key parameters and compares them with traditional interpolation methods. Corresponding results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in this study over traditional interpolation methods in terms of interpolation precision and the completion rate. Meanwhile, individual interpolation precision in each step of the proposed method is effectively enhanced.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of inorganic alkalis on the dynamic interfacial tensions (IFTs) of three betaine surfactants with different structures against daqing crude oil and model oils containing crude oil fractions, such as saturate, aromatic, resin, asphaltene and acidic fractions, have been studied by spinning drop tensiometer. The influences of pH value (alkali concentration and types) have been investigated. On the basis of the experimental results, one can find that it is difficult to reach the ultralow IFT value for all betaine solutions because of the mismatching of the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. The unsaturated and branched alkyl chain can enlarge the size of hydrophobic part and reduce the equilibrium IFTs. By adding alkali, the IFTs are controlled by the mixed adsorptions of the petroleum acids, produced soaps and betaine molecules. For betaines with small hydrophobic part, 18C and 22C, the mixed adsorption films are compact than those of pure betaine films, which results in the decrease of IFT. On the other hand, the petroleum acids and soaps adsorb competitively with betaine molecules, due to the tighter packing of 26C molecules at the interface, the equilibrium IFT values of 26C increase with an increase in pH value. The stronger the alkali is, the better the synergism or antagonism is. The effects of pH on the IFTs of betaine solutions against model oils containing crude oil fractions agree with those against crude oil. For all betaines, the order of the ability of affecting IFT is acidic fractions u003e resin u003e asphaltene u003e aromatic u003e saturate in general.",

Among these methods, hyperbranched modification based on polycondensation has been popular with researchers since it was proposed, and it has been applied to the preparation of various anion exchangers. Dendrimers are a class of three-dimensional, highly ordered dendritic macromolecules with perfect structure, high degree of surface functionality, and unique physicochemical properties. Recently, they have also gradually been applied in various chromatographic stationary-phase modifications and are expected to improve the structure and separation performance of the stationary phase, because its structure is similar to those of hyperbranched polymers. This article mainly summarizes the applications of hyperbranched and poly amidoamine dendrimers using grafted modification methods in the preparation of the chromatographic stationary phase. Finally, the trends and promising prospects of this field are presented.",

        "abstract": "Wheat is sensitive to high temperatures, but the spatial and temporal variability of high temperature and its impact on yield are often not known. An analysis of historical climate and yield data was undertaken to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of heat stress between heading and maturity and its impact on wheat grain yield in China. Several heat stress indices were developed to quantify heat intensity, frequency, and duration between heading and maturity based on measured maximum temperature records of the last 50 years from 166 stations in the main wheat-growing region of China. Surprisingly, heat stress between heading and maturity was more severe in the generally cooler northern wheat-growing regions than the generally warmer southern regions of China, because of the delayed time of heading with low temperatures during the earlier growing season and the exposure of the post-heading phase into the warmer part of the year. Heat stress between heading and maturity has increased in the last decades in most of the main winter wheat production areas of China, but the rate was higher in the south than in the north. The correlation between measured grain yields and post-heading heat stress and average temperature were statistically significant in the entire wheat-producing region, and explained about 29% of the observed spatial and temporal yield variability. A heat stress index considering the duration and intensity of heat between heading and maturity was required to describe the correlation of heat stress and yield variability. Because heat stress is a major cause of yield loss and the number of heat events is projected to increase in the future, quantifying the future impact of heat stress on wheat production and developing appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies are critical for developing food security policies in China and elsewhere.",

To improve the signal-to-noise and resolution of grain cleaning loss, the dynamic model for grain collision sensor array was established by using elastic thin plate theory and also the best structural parameters of sensitive element were determined to make out the grain and the stems momentum. The structural parameters of the thin plate were length of 300 mm, width of 200 mm, thickness of 1.5 mm, plate structural style and four corners fixed. Then, the experiment that grain impacted the sensitive elements with the thickness of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 mm was established on the test bench to verify the overall performance of the sensitive element. The results showed that the stiffness of the sensitive element designed was moderate, grain collision signal amplitude was about 1.2 V and decay time was within 1s, which was easily separated from other signals generated from the glumes and the straws. The sensitive element not only had high resolution between grain and stems, but also measured the highest frequency of grain impact, which significantly improved the overall performance of grain cleaning loss sensor. © 2011 Academic Journals.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this novel study was to introduce a cheap, simple, sensitive, and green methodology involving the dual application of synthesized porous SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) for selective conversion of non-fluorescent ketoprofen (KP) into a highly fluorescent species and as a sorbent in a μ-sample preparation method for extraction of KP from the three complex human serum, urine, and canal water samples. The clean separation and sensitive fluorescence determination of KP from these complex samples were carried out by coupling an ion chromatograph with a fluorescence detector (IC-FLD). The sorbent was prepared by a simple chemical precipitation method in water and characterized via various techniques. The porous SnO2 NPs, in addition to their role in the selective conversion of KP into a highly fluorescent species, also act as an effective sorbent for the selective degradation and elimination of polar organics, inorganic matrices, and heavy metals in complex samples. The optimized analytical method exhibited satisfactory linearity for ketoprofen in the concentration range of 0.2–1.5 mg kg−1 with a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.997. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) in human serum, urine, and canal water samples were 0.1 μg kg−1, 0.5 μg kg−1, and 0.39 μg kg−1 and 1.3 μg kg−1, 0.3 μg kg−1, and 1.7 μg kg−1, respectively. The method also showed good intra-day and inter-day precisions at the two concentration levels of 0.5 mg kg−1 and 1.3 mg kg−1 in complex samples with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 16.3% (n = 5), and satisfactory recoveries were retrieved in the range of 85.1–101.4% with minimum or no matrix effect.",

        "abstract": "SummaryNuclear DNA homologous recombination (HR) occurs within the context of a highly complex chromatin structure. In spite of extensive studies of HR in diverse organisms, mechanisms regulating HR within chromatin context remain poorly elucidated. Here we investigate the role and interplay of the histone chaperones NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN1 (NAP1) and NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN (NRP) and the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor INOSITOL AUXOTROPHY80 (INO80) in regulating somatic HR in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that simultaneous knockout of the four AtNAP1 genes and the two NRP genes in the sextuple mutant m123456-1 barely affects normal plant growth and development. Interestingly, compared to the respective AtNAP1 (m123-1 and m1234-1) or NRP (m56-1) loss-of-function mutants, the sextuple mutant m123456-1 displays an enhanced plant hypersensitivity to UV or bleomycin treatments. Using HR reporter constructs, we show that AtNAP1 and NRP act in parallel to synergistically promote somatic HR. Distinctively, the AtINO80 loss-of-function mutation (atino80-5) is epistatic to m56-1 in plant phenotype and telomere length but hypostatic to m56-1 in HR determinacy. Our further analyses show that expression of HR machinery genes and phosphorylation of H2A.X (γ-H2A.X) are not impaired in the mutants. Collectively, our study indicates that NRP and AtNAP1 synergistically promote HR upstream of AtINO80-mediated chromatin remodeling after γ-H2A.X foci formation during DNA damage repair.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "A novel hydrophilicity nano-titania coating modified magnetic graphene oxide (HTC-Mag-GO) has been synthesized. It has been evaluated in PRiME (process, robustness, improvements, matrix effects, ease of use) pass-through cleanup procedure for human blood prior to analysis of fipronil and its metabolites, i.e., fipronil sulphone, fipronil sulphide and fipronil desulfinyl by liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Compared with the Oasis PRiME HLB cartridge, HTC-Mag-GO is much more effective for the removal of matrix effect. Furthermore, it is beneficial to protect the chromatographic column and ESI source by the HTC-Mag-GO PRiME pass-through cleanup procedure, resulting from the much cleaner blood samples. Under the optimum conditions, the results show higher cleanup efficiency of HTC-Mag-GO with recoveries in the range of 92.4%-108%. Especially, the HTC-Mag-GO is also evaluated for reuse (20 times) without much sacrifice of the cleanup efficiency. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for fipronil, fipronil sulphone, fipronil sulphide and fipronil desulfinyl are 8.9 ng/L, 7.2 ng/L, 8.0 ng/L and 42 ng/L, respectively. The developed method has also been successfully applied to monitoring fipronil and its metabolites in 120 blood samples, and fipronil sulphone is detected in six samples with concentrations in the range of 12.1 ng/L-106 ng/L. Further, the well validation results and the application to analysis of fipronil and its metabolites in real samples demonstrate the applicability to toxico kinetic studies and clinical studies.",

        "title": "Climate change impacts on regional winter wheat production in main wheat production regions of China",
        "abstract": "Wheat is the second primary crop in China. Wheat production in China is an important component for national food security. The combination of high-resolution Global Climate Model (GCM) and WheatGrow model was used to assess the effects of climate change on wheat yields in the main wheat production regions of China. With the application of many techniques including the downscaling of meteorological data, rasterizing of sowing date, parameterization of region cultivar and vectorization of soil data, the spatial data in study area is divided into homogeneous grids with the resolution of 0.1° × 0.1°. The grid is taken as the basic simulation unit, and each grid has a complete set of input data (meteorological, soil, management and varieties). Regional productivities are simulated with WheatGrow for each grid cell under scenarios of climate-change. There is an advance in flowering date in future climate compare to 2000s, but with a more homogeneous pattern for the whole producing region. The changes in grain filling period are relatively stable. Under rain-fed conditions, wheat yield is reduced in the north regions of China in three future periods, while wheat yield increases in the south regions of China. Under full-irrigation conditions, irrigated wheat yields will increase in almost all regions of whole producing region. The spatial pattern of evapotranspiration change is quite similar to that of yield change under rain-fed and full-irrigation conditions. The correlation between wheat yield and evapotranspiration (ET) increases to 0.96 and 0.51 (p< 0.01) under rain-fed and full-irrigation conditions, respectively. The irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) will decrease under three time slices in 2030s, 2050s and 2070s in western Shandong, southern Sichuan, as well as northern Henan, Shanxi and Shaanxi, while IWUE will increase under scenarios of climate-change in other areas. The results revealed that the increase in effective irrigation in the future would help to increase the ET and further improve the wheat yield in the northern regions of China, and the limited water should be mad full use of in the regions with relatively high IWUE under scenarios of climate-change. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "A standard-free and sensitive method was developed for analysis of sucrose acetates in a crude 6-O-acetyl sucrose (S-6-a) product by on-line hydrolysis-high-performance liquid chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). Sucrose, three regio-isomers of acetyl sucrose and five regio-isomers of diacetyl sucrose were separated on a C18 column using 3% (v/v) acetonitrile in water as eluent within 25min. After purification with LC followed by semi-preparative HPLC, their chemical structures were identified by 1D, 2D NMR and LC-MS. Moreover, quantification of those regio-isomers was achieved by on-line alkaline hydrolysis to liberate sucrose using a post-column delivery system, and then detected by PAD for indirect estimation of the sucrose acetate content. Under optimal conditions, the linear ranges were from 0.03 to 150μmolL(-1) for sucrose corresponding to sucrose acetates with coefficient of determination as 0.9997 and detection limit as 0.01μmolL(-1) (S/N=3). Good repeatability was obtained (RSD<3%, n=6). Furthermore, this method has been successfully applied to the analysis of sucrose and sucrose acetates in a crude S-6-a product during synthesis, purification and structure elucidation studies. The recoveries were from 94.89% to 102.31% for sucrose and sucrose acetates.",

        "abstract": "Construction of spatial-temporal distribution models on fiber quality indexes in cotton are highly important for forecasting fiber quality indexes in different ecological regions and guiding import and export of raw cotton and textile factory's cotton blending in China.Field experiments were conducted at Nanjing(32°03′N,118°47′E) in 2004 and Guanyun(34°18′N,119°14′E) in 1999.Based on the experiment data,the effects of genotypes,fruit branches and nodes,mean daily temperature,sunlight length,soil moisture and plant nitrogen content on cotton fiber quality indexes were quantified at flowering and boll-forming stages,and spatial-temporal distribution models on cotton fiber length,strength,micronaire value and length uniformity were further constructed by integrating existing eco-models on cotton fiber quality.Then the models were validated using the experiment data from different eco-sites,cultivars,N fertilizations and water conditions.The results showed that the values of the root mean square error(RMSE) between simulated and observed values on fiber length,strength,micronaire value and length uniformity were,respectively,0.15 mm,0.29 cN tex-1,0.18,and 0.36 for temporal distribution models,and 0.22 mm,0.60 cN tex-1,0.15,and 0.86 for spatial distribution models,with the actual errors all lower than 5%.Overall,the present models are accurate and applicable for predicting spatial-temporal patterns of cotton quality indexes under different conditions.",

The analytes included 24 steroid hormones, 22 sulfonamides and 12 quinolones. The easy-to-handle magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction (Mag-dSPE) procedure was performed using three-dimensional interconnected magnetic chemically modified graphene oxide (3D-Mag-CMGO) as the adsorbent, and an enrichment factor of 100 times was obtained. Under the optimal conditions, the results showed higher extraction capacity of 3D-Mag-CMGO with recoveries between 78.0 and 109%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for 58 (ultra) trace analytes are in the range of 0.10–2.09 ng L−1. Validation results on linearity, specificity, accuracy, and precision, as well as the application to the analysis of 58 (ultra) trace analytes in ten real samples demonstrated the applicability to environment monitoring analysis.",

The DT-GrowCut based algorithm can give rough segmentation between the target, shadow and background. Several sets of SAR images from MSTAR datasets are segmented by the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional FCM based method in despeckling, extracting the edge and reducing the edge fuzzy degree. The results of experiments with different SAR images demonstrate the efficiency of the presented algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Higher temperatures caused by future climate change will bring more frequent heat stress events and pose an increasing risk to global wheat production. Crop models have been widely used to simulate future crop productivity but are rarely tested with observed heat stress experimental datasets. Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat, DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with four years of environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stage. Heat stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain yield and grain protein concentration varied depending on cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat degree days (HDD, degree days over 30°C), grain filling duration was reduced by 0.30% to 0.60%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by 0.37% to 0.43%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0% to 1.6%, but grain protein concentration was increased by 0.50% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80% for cv Xumai30. The tested crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed reductions in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass, and grain yield, as well as the observed increase in grain protein concentration due to heat stress. Most of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts better during grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models require improvements in the response to heat stress during grain filling, but all models need improvements in simulating heat stress effects on grain set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic variability in the response of wheat to heat stress needs to be considered through cultivar parameters in future simulation studies.

The daily meteorological data during the years from 1961 to 1970 (1960s) and 1996 to 2005 (2000s) of 333 weather stations in main rice growing regions of China were processed to generate the gridded daily meteorological surface data using ANUSPLIN and ARCGIS. The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the climate resources for the rice production, including total sunshine hours, total growing degree days above 10°C, average difference of diurnal air temperature, total precipitation, total rainfall days and average daily precipitation during rice-growing periods between two decades (1960s and 2000s) were calculated and analyzed based on the grid cell. As compared with 1960s, the total sunshine hours in rice-growing periods of 2000s decreased by 11.93%, and the decreasing rates of total sunshine hours in the Northeast and Southwest China were lower than those in the Middle and South China. From 1960s to 2000s, the total growing degree days above 10°C increased by 9.40%, and the increasing rates of total growing degree days above 10°C in the Northeast and Southwest China were faster than those in the Middle and South China. However, in part areas of the Middle and South China, the total growing degree days above 10°C during rice-growing periods decreased. The average differences of diurnal air temperature during rice-growing periods of 2000s decreased by 4.86% as compared with 1960s, while increased in part areas of the Middle and South China. The decreasing rates of average difference of diurnal air temperature in the Northeast and Southwest China were higher than those in the Middle and South China. Compared with 1960s, total precipitation during rice-growing periods in 2000s increased by 1.59% and average daily precipitation increased by 3.22%. The spatial distribution of the change rate of average daily precipitation was similar to that of total precipitation, the total precipitation and average daily precipitation decreased in Ningxia province and the Northeast China, while increased in the Middle and South China. Compared with 1960s, the total rainfall days during rice-growing periods of 2000s decreased by 1.60%, and the decreasing rates of total rainfall days in the Northeast and Middle China were lower than that in the South China. These results can provide the technical support for further analysis of yield increasing potential and yield increasing method of rice in China.",

        "abstract": "Polymyxins are amongst the most important antibiotics in modern medicine, in recent times their clinical utility has been overshadowed by nosocomial outbreaks of polymyxin resistant MDR Gram-negative 'superbugs'. An effective strategy to surmount polymyxin resistance is combination therapy with FDA-approved non-antibiotic drugs. Herein we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the mechanism(s) of synergy between polymyxin B and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen against a polymyxin-resistant MDR cystic fibrosis (CF)  FADDI-PA006 isolate (polymyxin B MIC=8 mg/L , it is an MDR polymyxin resistant  isolated from the lungs of a CF patient). The metabolome of FADDI-PA006 was profiled at 15 min, 1 and 4 h following treatment with polymyxin B (2 mg/L), tamoxifen (8 mg/L) either as monotherapy or in combination. At 15 min, the combination treatment induced a marked decrease in lipids, primarily fatty acid and glycerophospholipid metabolites that are involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial membranes. In line with the polymyxin-resistant status of this strain, at 1 h, both polymyxin B and tamoxifen monotherapies produced little effect on bacterial metabolism. In contrast to the combination which induced extensive reduction (≥ 1.0-log2-fold, p ≤ 0.05; FDR ≤ 0.05) in the levels of essential intermediates involved in cell envelope biosynthesis. Overall, these novel findings demonstrate that the primary mechanisms underlying the synergistic bactericidal effect of the combination against the polymyxin-resistant  CF isolate FADDI-PA006 involves a disruption of the cell envelope biogenesis and an inhibition of aminoarabinose LPS modifications that confer polymyxin resistance.",

        "abstract": "Objective To compare the antispastic effects of nitroglycerin (NTG),verapamil(VP) and papaverine(PA) on human radial arteries. Methods The radial arteries of patients having accepted the operation of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were collected post operation. The therapeutical effect of NTG,VP and PA on spasm of isolated radial arteries and the relaxing function of radial arteries were evaluated by \"organ bath\" technique. Results The radial arteries in NTG ,VP and PA solutions were relaxed in 11 min after vasospasm and there was no difference between them (P > 0.05). But during the initial three minutes,the relaxation effect of NTG was significantly better than other two groups. Relaxation curve showed that the ability of vasodilatation of NTG,VP and PA decreased in order. In the experiment about antivasospasm pretreatment of radial arteries,the effects of VP group were better than NTG and PA group(P < 0.05). After cold storage for 24 h,VP still could prevent vasospasm. But NTG and PA hardly had any function and there was no difference compared with the control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion Although in the final all these drugs could prevent and relieve vasospasm of radial arteries in the different level,it appeared that nitroglycerin was more fit for treating spastic radial artery than other drugs. Then verapamil could prevent spasm of radial artery by pretreatment on a certain degree.",

        "abstract": "Access control is one of the most important security mechanisms in cloud computing. Attribute-based access control provides a flexible approach that allows data owners to integrate data access policies within the encrypted data. However, little work has been done to explore temporal attributes in specifying and enforcing the data owner's policy and the data user's privileges in cloud-based environments. In this paper, we present an efficient temporal access control encryption scheme for cloud services with the help of cryptographic integer comparisons and a proxy-based re-encryption mechanism on the current time. We also provide a dual comparative expression of integer ranges to extend the power of attribute expression for implementing various temporal constraints. We prove the security strength of the proposed scheme and our experimental results not only validate the effectiveness of our scheme, but also show that the proposed integer comparison scheme performs significantly better than previous bitwise comparison scheme.",

Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of monodisperse micron-grade carbon microspheres (CMSs) through the hydrothermal carbonization of sucrose with the assistance of trace PAAS, and their potential application as a green stationary phase for ion chromatography. An appropriate amount of PAAS efficiently inhibits the crosslinking of the formed CMSs, which results in monodispersity. The hydrothermal method was proven effective at a high sucrose concentration and for scalable experiments. The average size of the CMSs could be facilely regulated from 1.2 μm to 5.0 μm via hydrothermal time, temperature and sucrose concentration. The hydrothermal CMSs were further modified with quaternary ammonium groups based on the polycondensation of methylamine and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether. Utilizing the quaternized CMSs as an ion chromatography stationary phase and potassium hydroxide solutions as the mobile phase, common inorganic anions were well separated with good symmetrical peak shapes and high stability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Climate change has resulted in a continuous increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme low-temperature events and poses a serious threat to wheat production in China. To better understand the effects of low temperature on wheat photosynthetic production and yield formation, two-year temperature controlled experiments in phytotrons were performed with two different cold-sensitive winter wheat cultivars at five daily maximum/minimum temperature levels and three temperature durations—2, 4 and 6 days—at both jointing and booting stages. Except for its effect on mean net assimilation rate ( MNAR ) at jointing, low temperature level had significant negative effects on mean leaf area index ( MLAI ), mean net assimilation rate ( MNAR ), harvest index ( HI ), biomass per plant ( BPP M  ) and grain yield per plant ( GYPP ), while photosynthetic duration ( D ) (except for Yangmai16 at jointing) was significantly positively affected. Moreover, low temperature duration and its interaction with low temperature level had negative effects on  MLAI, MNAR, HI, BPP M   and  GYPP , but only the effects of low temperature duration on  HI, BPP M   and  GYPP  and the interaction effect on  BPP M   and  GYPP  reached a significant level. In addition,  BPP M   and  GYPP  were more sensitive to low temperature at booting than at jointing stage. Furthermore, significant negative linear relationships were observed between the accumulated cold degree days ( ACDD ) and  MLAI ,  MNAR ,  HI ,  BPP M   and  GYPP , while a significant positive linear relationship was observed between  ACDD  and  D  in both cultivars. The contribution of  BPP M   to the variation of  GYPP  was greater than that of  HI  in both cultivars. However, for biomass, from the first day of low-temperature treatment to maturity ( BPP T-M  ), the major variation was caused by  MLAI  when low temperature occurred at jointing and by  MNAR  when low temperature occurred at booting. These results could support the improvement of crop model algorithms under cold stress and assist in the wheat breeding with higher cold tolerance.",

        "title": "Dynamic Analysis on Response of Dry Matter Accumulation and Partitioning to Nitrogen Fertilizer in Wheat Cultivars with Different Plant Types",
        "abstract": "Biomass accumulation and partition in different plant organs affect the grain yield in cereal crops. Many investigators have established equations to simulate the dynamic growth and biomass accumulation of crops in various experiments using polynomial, Expolianear, Logistic, and Richard models. However, these models have limitations in some extent. The vapor pressure (VP) model has been used to quantitatively simulate the dynamic accumulation of dry matter in maize (Zea mays L.) roots and the branch number of princess flower. In this study, the VP model was introduced in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to test its applicability in simulating accumulation and partitioning of biomass. Four wheat cultivars with four plant types, respectively, were planted in 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 growing seasons under the nitrogen application levels of 75, 150, and 225 kg ha?1. Based on the dry weights of various organs at main growth stages, the Richards and VP equations tested the fitness of the biomass accumulation and partitioning in relation to accumulated growing-degree days. The results showed that with increasing nitrogen rate, the average dry matter growth rate (Ra), maximum growth rate (Rmax) and duration of the third phase (D3) increased, while the time reaching to Rmax was shortened consistently in four cultivars. In Aikang 58 (compact-short type), Huaimai 17 (loose type) and Yangmai 12 (intermediate type), the initial growth potential (R0) increased with the promotion of nitrogen rate, while the duration of early increment phase (D1) and the dry matter accumulation at Rmax (WRmax) decreased. In contrast, the R0, WRmax, and D1 of Ningmai 9 (compact-high type) exhibited an opposite pattern. In Aikang 58 and Ningmai 9, the second phase duration (D2) decreased when the nitrogen rate increased, and Yangmai 12 and Huaimai 17 had the smallest D2 value under the medium nitrogen rate. With the increase of nitrogen rate, the maximum dry matter partitioning percentage (Pmax) of leaf and spike in Huaimai 17 and Yangmai 12 as well as the maximum dry matter partitioning percentage of stem and sheath (PSmax) in Aikang 58 and Ningmai 9 decreased. In contrast, the Pmax of leaf and spike in Aikang 58 and Ningmai 9, and the PSmax in Huaimai 17 and Yangmai 12 increased accompanying with the increase of nitrogen rate. In terms of the maximum decreasing rate of dry matter partitioning percentage (MDRP) to leaf, Ningmai 9, Huaimai 17 and Yangmai 12 showed a decrease trend when nitrogen rate increased, while Aikang 58 was in an increase tendency. For the maximum increasing rate of dry matter partitioning percentage (MIRP) to spike, Aikang 58 and Ningmai 9 had a negative response to nitrogen rate and Huaimai 17 and Yangmai 12 had a positive response. Excessive application of nitrogen had negative effects on the promotion of MDRP to spike in Ningmai 9 and the reduction of MIRP to spike in Yangmai 12. No consistent effects were observed on the maximum changing rate of dry matter partitioning percentage to stem and sheath (RSimax and RSdmax). Thereby, plant types of wheat cultivars should be considered in the nitrogen application regime in practical system of cultivation techniques.",

The electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst towards methanol oxidation was evaluated via cyclic voltammetry. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was fabricated using Nafion 117 as the membrane and MWNT(-SH)-SL-AuNP as the cathode catalyst. The simplicity of preparation and excellent performance of the MWNT(-SH)-SL-AuNP catalyst suggest its potential application in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). © 2011 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",

Application of Web technology to DSS is becoming a major direction for development of DSS in agriculture. Based on the stand-alone growth model-based decision support system for wheat management and the four-layer Web structure of 'Web browser/Web server/Application server/Database server', a growth model and web-application-based decision support system for wheat management (GMDSSWM w) with good compatibility, arrangement and security was developed by using the techniques of object-orientation, COM + component and Web application. The implemented system can be used for evaluating individual and comprehensive management strategies based on the results of wheat growth simulation under the Web service environment. The test and application of the system showed that the GMDSSWM w was realized with proper functions of long-distance prediction, decision-making and dynamic regulation, thus providing basis for establishing Web-based digital wheat farming system as well as other crops' management systems.",

This study aimed to investigate the pharmacodynamics of polymyxin B in combination with the antiretroviral drug zidovudine against  Three isolates were evaluated in static time-kill studies (0 - 64 mg/L) over 48 h. A one-compartment  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model (IVM) was used to simulate humanized dosage regimens of polymyxin B (4 mg/L as continuous infusion) and zidovudine (as bolus dose thrice daily to achieve C = 6 mg/L) against  BM1 over 72 h. The antimicrobial synergy of the combination was further evaluated in a murine thigh infection model against  02. In the static time-kill studies, polymyxin B monotherapy produced rapid and extensive killing against all three isolates followed by extensive regrowth, whereas zidovudine produced modest killing followed by significant regrowth at 24 h. Polymyxin B in combination with zidovudine significantly enhanced the antimicrobial activity (≥ 4 logCFU/mL) and minimized bacterial regrowth. In the IVM, the combination was synergistic and the total bacterial loads were below the limit of detection for up to 72 h. In the murine thigh infection model, the bacterial burden at 24 h in the combination group was ≥ 3 logCFU/thigh lower compared to each monotherapy against  02. Overall, polymyxin B-zidovudine combination demonstrates superior antimicrobial efficacy and minimized emergence of resistance to polymyxins.",

        "abstract": "Aim To investigate the effect of Ginsenoside Rh2 on the growth of ectopic endometrium in rat model of endometriosis and its mechanism of action.Methods The rat model of endometriosis was established by transplantation surgery.The model rats were randomly divided into five groups: model control group(0.5% CMC-Na),gestrinone(1.5 mg·kg-1) group,and Rh2 low-,medium-and high-dose(5,10,40 mg·kg-1) groups.At the end of three weeks treatment,the rats were sacrificed,and serum and ectopic endometrium were collected.Histopathologic changes of ectopic endometrium were tested by HE staining.The levels of estrogen(E2),progesterone(P) and endometrial antibody(EMAb) were observed by ELISA method.The expression of apoptotic factors were tested by western blotting.Results Rh2(40 mg·kg-1) obviously suppressed the ectopic endometrium,and reduced the numbers of endometrial gland and the volume of glandular cavity.Rh2(5,10,40 mg·kg-1) reduced dose-dependently the level of E2,P and EMAb,and increased the expression of Caspase-9,Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2.Conclusion Ginsenoside Rh2(40 mg·kg-1) obviously inhibits the growth of ectopic endometrium in the established rat model of endometriosis,and its mechanism of action may relate to reducing the level of E2,P and EMAb,and increasing the protein expression of Caspase-9,Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2.",

Based on growth estimating models in wheat and rice established by the authors' group, a RS image-based monitoring system was developed based on the Microsoft. NET framework using GDAL and GDI+ as information processing methods and EM algorithm for classifying crop growth indices. This system realized the multiple functions as accessing the RS images with common formats, extracting crop information, inverting growth indices, clustering analysis, generating the thematic map and issuing the information with remote sensing technology. Several functions of the system were tested using the RS images at Fangqiang Farm, Jiangsu Province. The results showed that the system could effectively read general remote sensing images, invert the crop growth indices, classify the crop growth information based on the cluster models, interact with users for generating the thematic map of crop growth status, and issue the RS image information rapidly via internet. The present system has overcome the previous weakness that the ordinary users could not directly participate in the process of RS images analysis, and can help to monitor the crop growth condition and provide decision support for precision crop management at regional scale.",

        "abstract": "This article aims to establish a cryptographic solution to improve security and reliability of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. By breaking down the existing structure of attribute-based encryption, we propose a new cryptographic ABAC (C-ABAC) framework with dynamic policy authorization and real-time attribute credentials. Moreover, a practical C-ABAC construction is proposed to support provable policy decision making and verifiable attribute Tokens among multiple distributed authorities. In this construction, we develop a concrete approach of generating a cryptographic policy from access control markup language. We also prove that attribute Token has existential unforgeability under chosen-attribute and chosen-nonce attacks, and the cryptographic policy is existentially unforgeable under chosen-object attack. In addition, our C-ABAC construction provides semantic security against chosen-plaintext attack with Token and policy queries under the extended general Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the C-ABAC system according to complexity analysis and experimental results. The results show that the C-ABAC system is reliable and easy to implement.",

The dynamic model of relative dry matter accumulation (RDMA) was established with the normalized DMA and TEP (product of thermal effectiveness and PAR) from emergence to maturity, and the temporal characteristics of DMA changes was quantitatively analyzed based on the RDMA model. The dynamic changes of the RDMA could be well described with Richards equation, i. e., RDMA = 1.0157/(1 +e(3.6329-7.5907xRTEP)) 1/0.5574 (r = 0.9938). The model was validated with independent field experiment datasets, involving different eco-sites, cultivars, and nitrogen application rates. The RMSE (root mean square error) between the simulated and observed values of DMA at varied RTEP was 0.86 t x hm(-2). According to the two inflexion points of dry matter accumulation rate equation, the whole process of dry matter accumulation could be divided into early, middle, and late phases. The maximum dry matter accumulation rate (AR(max)), relative TEP at AR(max), and relative dry matter accumulation at AR(max) were found to be 2.24, 0.56, and 0.46, respectively.",

Both PGRs were extracted by modified and miniaturized ion chromatography-Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (IC-QuEChERS) method from ten food samples. The separation and sensitive determination were carried out by using ion chromatography coupled with fluorescence and ultraviolet (IC-FLD/UV) detector.

        "abstract": "The current study describes the determination of phenols using ion chromatography-online electrochemical derivatization-fluorescence detection (IC/ED/FD). Six model phenols including 4-methylphenol (pMP), 2, 4-dimethylphenol (DMP), 4-tert-butylphenol (TBP), 4-hydroxylphenolacetic acid (pHPA), 4-acetamidophenol (pAAP), and phenol (P) were well separated on an anion-exchange column under ion exchange mode using NaOH with small amount of acetonitrile added as eluent. Online electrochemical derivatization performed via a laboratory-made electrolytic cell (EC), consisting of porous titanium electrode and cation-exchange membrane (CEM), allows the oxidation products that are strongly fluorescent to be detected by the fluorescence detector. NaOH eluent used in the present method matches well with the maximal fluorescence intensity obtained at alkaline condition for oxidized phenols, thus the addition of specific buffer solution after oxidation encountered in previous report could be eliminated. This process leads to a simplified procedure. The proposed method was sensitive to the limits of detection in the range of 0.4 μg/L and 3.8 μg/L and the limits of quantification between 1.2 μg/L and 13 μg/L due to the strong electro-oxidation capacity of porous titanium electrode, as well as the implementation of time-programmed potential over EC. The linear ranges were 2.0-1.0 × 10(4) μg/L for pAAP and DMP, and 10-1.0 × 10(4) μg/L for P, pMP, pHPA, and TBP, respectively. The relative standard deviations range from 0.9% to 4.8%. The utilization of the method was demonstrated by the analysis of real samples. The average spiked recoveries of target analytes in pool water were 81.0-118%.",

        "abstract": "to investigate the effect of gossypol on the growth of cultured human uterine leiomyoma and myometrial cells, the level of Bcl-2 and the activity of Src and estrogen receptor (ERα).human uterine leiomyoma and adjacent normal myometrial cells were cultured in vitro. Both cell types were treated with a graded concentration of gossypol. Cell viability was assayed using CCK-8. Morphological change was observed with optical and electronic microscopy. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL assay. Levels of Bcl-2, ERα and Src were analyzed using Western blotting.gossypol significantly inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells with the IC(50) value and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 6.5 (4.0-10.5), 9.0 (4.9-16.5), and 7.5 (4.0-14.1) micromol/L at 20, 40, and 60 h, respectively. Gossypol exerted inhibitory effects on the myometrial cells with the IC(50) value and its 95% CI of 49.1 (28.3-85.0), 14.5 (7.7-27.4), and 2.6 (1.2-5.6) micromol/L at 20, 40, and 60 h, respectively. Compared with control, gossypol 0.1-3.0 micromol/L markedly decreased the protein expression of Bcl-2 (P<0.05) in both leiomyoma and myometrial cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and significantly suppressed the level of phospho-Tyr416Src (P<0.05) in both cell types at 3.0 micromol/L without obvious alteration of c-Src and phospho-Tyr527Src levels (P>0.05). In addition, gossypol markedly reduced both the expression of ERα (P<0.05) at the low concentration of 0.1 micromol/L in the myometrial cells and the level of phospho-ser167ERα (P<0.05) at the high concentration of 3.0 μmol/L in the leiomyoma cells.gossypol inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in human uterine leiomyoma and myometrial cells. It is likely that the mechanisms of action involve reducing the protein level of Bcl-2 and the activity of Src and ERα.",

        "abstract": "Wireless channel propagation characteristics and models are important to ensure the communication quality of wireless sensor networks in agriculture. Wireless channel attenuation experiments were carried out at different node antenna heights (0.8 m, 1.2 m, 1.6 m, and 2.0 m) in the tillering, jointing, and grain filling stages of rice fields. We studied the path loss variation trends at different transmission distances and analyzed the differences between estimated values and measured values of path loss in a free space model and a two-ray model. Regression analysis of measured path loss values was used to establish a one-slope log-distance model and propose a modified two-slope log-distance model. The attenuation speed in wireless channel propagation in rice fields intensified with rice developmental stage and the transmission range had monotone increases with changes in antenna height. The relative error (RE) of estimation in the free space model and the two-ray model under four heights ranged from 6.48⁻15.49% and 2.09⁻13.51%, respectively, and these two models were inadequate for estimating wireless channel path loss in rice fields. The ranges of estimated RE for the one-slope and modified two-slope log-distance models during the three rice developmental stages were 2.40⁻2.25% and 1.89⁻1.31%, respectively. The one-slope and modified two-slope log-distance model had better applicability for modeling of wireless channels in rice fields. The estimated RE values for the modified two-slope log-distance model were all less than 2%, which improved the performance of the one-slope log-distance model. This validates that the modified two-slope log-distance model had better applicability in a rice field environment than the other models. These data provide a basis for modeling of sensor network channels and construction of wireless sensor networks in rice fields. Our results will aid in the design of effective rice field WSNs and increase the transmission quality in rice field sensor networks.",

        "abstract": "With the development of computer graphics and crop simulation,virtual crop study,intuitionally expressing crop growth on computer,attracted many scientists to focus on this field.Some scientists have made great progress on the visualization of wheat,maize,soybean,rice and cotton,etc.Leaf shape is a very important characteristic in virtual crop growth modeling,and some empirical curves have been used to describe leaf morphology based on field experiments in the previous study.The fitting curves can help to understand organ morphogenesis,but the fitting parameters obtained from the given leaves and time cannot suit to changed growth process of leaves.So developing a mechanism model to simulate the leaf morphology is critical for virtual crop growth.Organ morphogenesis of plant is decided to its forces.After force analysis on a rice leaf,the gravity fraction in leaf normal direction keeps equilibrium with elasticity,and then a dynamic leaf curvature equation was deduced with some assumption.The equation included the synthetic effect of leaf blade length,leaf blade width,initial leaf angle,specific leaf weight and deformation coefficient on leaf space shape.Then the equation was solved with parameterization.The sensitivity analysis showed that the equation could well reflect the integrated effects of leaf length,leaf width,specific leaf weight and leaf deformation coefficient,consistent with rice plant architecture in practice.A field experiment was conducted at the Nanjing Agricultural University for validating the equation.Two cultivars(SU63 and WYJ7) were nursed in dry-bed on May 20,and transplanted on June 20 with single seedling.Water and nutrients were supplied according to high yielding rice management.At jointing and booting stages of rice,the 3-dimension coordinates of several points in leaf midrib were measured with the 3D digitizer,and at the same time leaf blade length,width,initial leaf angle were obtained.Then simulation analyses were conducted on the equation with the experiment data.The results indicated that the leaf curvature equation could reasonably and reliably describe the change pattern of leaf shape characteristics of rice under different conditions.The leaf curve equation could dynamically simulate the space shape of leaves with different initial leaf angles and special leaf weights by reduced parameters of rice leaf,especially in modeling day-to-day crop growth.",

        "abstract": "The nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) is considered to be a conserved histone chaperone, facilitating the assembly of nucleosomes in all eukaryotes. However, studies in yeast and animal cells also indicated that NAP1 proteins have diverse functions likely independent of nucleosome-assembly activity. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding NAP1-like proteins from the monocotyledon rice ( Oryza sativa L.) and the dicotyledon tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum L.). Northern-blot analysis demonstrated that the two rice NAP1-like genes are predominantly expressed in stem tissues such as root and shoot apical meristems as well as in young flowers. During the cell cycle, all four tobacco NAP1-like genes are highly expressed, with one of them showing a slightly increased expression at the G1/S transition. These results are consistent with a role for plant NAP1-like proteins in cell division. In vitro binding assays revealed that different NAP1-like proteins bind, with distinct relative binding strengths, to different classes of histone. Intracellular localization analyses showed that some NAP1-like proteins could be targeted into the nucleus whereas others are exclusively cytoplasm-localized. It is thus likely that different plant NAP1-like proteins have distinct functions in vivo. Plant NAP1-like proteins were observed to concentrate around the metaphase plate and in the phragmoplast, suggesting a role in mitotic events and cytokinesis.",

Methods: The rat models of NOMAc were established by surgical operation method; histopathologic changes of ectopic endometrium were tested by HE staining; the level of antiendometrium antibody (EMAb) was tested by Elisa; the expression levels of apoptosis factors were tested by Western blot. Results: NOMAc (0.5, 1.5, 15 mg·kg -1) shriveled ectopic endometrium; the number of endometrial gland was fewer; glandular cavity was smaller in NOMAc groups than those of model groups. NOMAc reduced dose-dependently the endometrial thickness and the level of EMAb. NOMAc (0.5, 1.5, 15 mg·kg -1) increased Caspase-9, Caspase-3 and Bax protein expression and reduced Bcl-2 protein expression. Conclusion: The inhibitory effect of NOMAc on ectopic endometrium of rat models may be related to reducing the level of EMAb, increasing Bax, reducing Bcl-2 protein expression, and activating Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 protein expression in endogenous apoptosis pathway.",

Transforming growth factor-β2 can induce the mesenchymal transition. Objective: To in vitro culture human lens epithelial cells and to investigate the effect of transforming growth factor-β2 on the expression of E-cadherin and α-smooth muscle actin in human lens epithelial cells. Methods: First, human lens epithelial cells were cultured in vitro by tissue block method and passaged. Then, the 5th generation of human lens epithelial cells were collected and treated with transforming growth factor-β2 (100 ng/L) for inducement for 48 hours. Next, the expression of α-smooth muscle actin mRNA and E-cadherin mRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR, and the expression of the two proteins mentioned above were detected with Western blot method. Results and Conclusion: After human lens epithelial cells were treated with transforming growth factor-β2 for 48 hours, the expression of E-cadherin was decreased significantly; while the expression of α-smooth muscle actin was increased significantly. These results suggest that transforming growth factor-β2 can successfully induce mesenchymal transition in human lens epithelial cells, and the lens epithelial cells treated with transforming growth factor-β2 can be used as a cell model for mesenchymal transition.",

        "abstract": "Non-destructive and quick assessment of leaf nitrogen (N) status is important for dynamic management of nitrogen nutrition and productivity forecast in crop production. This research was undertaken to make a systematic analysis on the quantitative relationship of leaf nitrogen concentrations (LNCs) to different hyperspectral vegetation indices with multiple field experiments under varied nitrogen rates and varied types in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The results showed that some published indices had good relations with LNC such as two-band indices, R 750/R 710 (ZM), Gitelson and Merzlyak index two (GM-2), R 735/R 720 (RI-1dB), R 738/R 720 (RI-2dB) and the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), three-band indices, adjusted normalized index 705 (mND705), physiological reflectance index c (PRI c), terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), and red edge position derived with four point linear interpolation (REP_LI). Three-band indices performed better than two-band indices, with MTCI exhibiting the best logarithmic relation to LNC in rice. Then, hyper-spectral vegetation indices computed with random two bands (λ 1 and λ 2) from 400 to 2500nm range were related to LNC of rice. The results indicated that two-band indices combined with bands of 550-600nm and 500-550nm in green region had good relationships with LNC, and simple ratio index SR(533,565) performed the best in all two-band indices, similar to the published three-band indices (mND705, PRI c and MTCI). New three-band indices R 434/(R 496+R 401) and R 705/(R 717+R 491) were proposed for prediction of LNC with improved ability over the SR(533,565) and published spectral indices. Moreover, R 705/(R 717+R 491) performed well in all the data from ground spectra, modeled AVIRIS and Hyperion spectra, and acquired Hyperion image hyperspectra. The R 434/(R 496+R 401) also exhibited well in both ground and modeled AVIRIS and Hyperion image spectra, but could not be tested with the acquired Hyperion image because of the absence in radiometric calibration of the bands less than 416nm. Overall, the newly developed three-band spectral index R 705/(R 717+R 491) should be a good indicator of LNC at ground and space scales in rice. Yet, these new indices still need to be tested with more remote sensors based on ground, airborne and spaceborne, and verified widely in other ecological locations involving different cultivars and production systems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

The use of suppression-conductometry showed the special features of lowering the background of the eluent, increasing the conductance of the detected ions and improving the S/N ratio. Amounts of H+ and OH- required to suppress the eluent were supplied by an electrochemical self-generating suppressor through continuous electrolysis of water. Anions and cations in sea water were separated and determined simultaneausly by the combining use of anion separation column (and/or cation separation column) with suppression-conductometric detection, and by the use of equi-grading and/or gradient elution. Data of linear regression equations and detection limits of 7 anions and 6 cations were given.",

A series of standard solutions consisting of target anions of various concentrations from 0.01 to 75 mg/L were analyzed, with a correlation coefficient (r) ≥ 0.9990. The limits of detection were in the range of 0.49-9.84 μg/L based on the S/N of 3 and a 25 μL injection volume. RSDs for retention time, peak area, and peak height were all <1.77%.

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate homozygous deletion and mutation of the CDKN2A gene (p16INK4a and p14ARF gene) in 38 hydatidiform mole patients and 30 early pregnancy patients. Methods: A total of 38 hydatidiform mole and 30 early pregnancy villi samples were assessed for homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and mutations were detected using degenerative high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Results: (1) Among the 38 hydatidiform mole samples, homozygous deletions of p16INK4a exon 1 were identified in 5 cases (13.16%). However, no homozygous deletions of p16INK4a exon 1 were found in the 30 early pregnancy samples. A significant difference was found in the rate of homozygous deletion of p16INK4a exon 1 between hydatidiform mole and early pregnancy villi samples(P=0.036). (2) No homozygous deletions of p14ARF exon 1 and p16INK4a exon 2 were found in any of the 38 hydatidiform mole samples or the 30 early pregnancy samples. (3) In all samples, all PCR amplification products of p14ARF exon 1 and p16INK4a exon 1 and 2 produced single peak curves when detected by DHPLC, suggesting an absence of mutations. Conclusion: There is probably a close correlation between the homozygous deletion of CDKN2A and the occurrence of hydatidiform mole.",

        "abstract": "Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is widely used in solvents, fuels, monomers, and synthesis. The inorganic anions in DMC always have a big impact on product performance. Herein, improvement in the performance of the conventional column-switching technique and on-line elimination pretreatment system was achieved to automatically determine trace anions in DMC. In this study, a pretreatment column was applied to eliminate the DMC matrix on-line, and target anions were eluted from the pretreatment column and retained in the concentrator column. The collected anions were eventually separated in the analytical column using the column-switching technique. Eluent containing 100% acetonitrile was used to wash out DMC and regenerate the pretreatment column at the same time. A type of water-soluble solvent was added to the DMC samples before injection to help improve their solubility in the eluent, which was subsequently removed by extending the collection time in the concentration procedure. This method shows satisfactory linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9977) in the range of 0.1–8.0 mg L−1. The detection limit based on the signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) is 2.79–5.66 μg L−1. The recovery rate for the anions is 85.09–99.07%. Good reproducibility was obtained with relative standard deviations less than 4.03% by injecting standard solutions 6 times.",

        "abstract": "Even though role-based access control (RBAC) can tremendously help us to minimize the complexity in administering users, it still needs to realize the notion of roles at the resource level. In this paper, we propose a practical cryptographic RBAC model, called role-key hierarchy model, to support various security features, including signature, identification, and encryption on role-key hierarchy. In addition, several advanced features, such as role or user revocation, tracing, and anonymity, are implemented as well. With the help of rich algebraic structure of elliptic curves, we introduce a unified and complete construction of role-based cryptosystem to verify the rationality and validity of our proposed model. In addition, a proof-of-concept prototype implementation and performance evaluation is discussed to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of rapid oral disinte- grating tablet and those of market available tablet of levonorgestrel(LNG). Methods: Twenty healthy female volunteers were given single oral dose of LNG rapid oral disintegrating tablet and market available tablet in a randomised crossover study. The dose was 0.75 mg. The blood samples were collected at different time points before and after taking the medication within 72 h. The plasma concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. The pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability were calculated using SAS software. Results: The limit of detection was 10 pg/ml. The intra-day precision RSD of 3 different concentrations (300 pg/ml, 2 000 pg/ml, 6 000 pg/ml) of quality control plasma were 12.4%, 9.3%, 3.1%, respectively (n =5), and the inter-day precision RSD were 4.3%, 11.7%, 5.7%, respectively (n=5). The main pharmacokinetic parameters of rapid oral disintegrating tablet and market available tablet were as follows: tmax 1.6 ± 0.2 h and 1.7 ± 0.3 h; Cmax 6.2 ± 0.8 ng/ml and 6.5 ± 1.0 ng/ml; AUC0-72 h 85.5 ± 24.4 h·ng/ml and 90.8 ± 27.1 h·ng/ml; AUC0-inf 96.8 ± 27.9 h·ng/ml and 101.2 ± 30.8 h·ng/ml; t1/2 25.3 ± 3.5 h and 24.2 ± 3.1 h, respectively.

        "abstract": "Leaf chlorophyll (Chl) status is a key index for evaluating crop photosynthetic efficiency and nutritional stress. Non-destructive and quick assessment of leaf Chl status is needed for growth diagnosis and nitrogen management in crop production. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between leaf Chl concentration and spectral reflectance characteristics, and to develop useful hyperspectral indices for nondestructive and quick estimation of Chl in rice ( Oryza sativa ). Four field experiments with different nitrogen application rates and rice cultivare were conducted at different eco-sites over three years. Time course measurements were taken on hyperspectral reflectance of 350∼2500 nm and Chl concentration in four top leaves, and the simple ratio spectral index (SR[λ1, λ2]) and normalized difference spectral index (ND [λ1, λ2]) were calculated with all combinations of two wavelengths (λ1 and λ2 nm) and other Chl sensitive parameters. Analysis showed that the best indicators for estimating Chl concentration in rice leaves were narrowband hyperspectral indices calculated in the red edge region, and that the optimum wavelengths were different for specific Chi components. The best SR indices for estimation of chlorophyll a ( Chla) , total chlorophyll (Chla + b), and chlorophyll 6 (Chlb) were SA (724, 709), SR (728, 709) and SR (749, 745), with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.944, 0.946 and 0.905. The best ND indices were ND (780, 709), ND (780, 712) and ND (749, 745), with R2 values of 0.944, 0.946 and 0.905. Modifying the above spectral indices with the reflectance at 445 nm reduced the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, and increased the extrapolation potential for the model. Tests with another independent datasets showed that the modified SR indices: mSR (724, 709) , mSR (728, 709) and mSR (749, 745) , and the modified ND indices: mND (780, 709) , mND (780, 712) and mND (749, 745) were better predictors of Chla, Chla + b and Chlb concentrations with RMSE values of 0.168, 0.190, 0.052, 0.159, 0.176 and 0.052, respectively, and RE values of 8.18% , 7.74% , 13.01% , 8.26% , 7.59% , 12.96%. These values indicated that the above spectral parameters can be used to estimate leaf Chl concentrations with good precision and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the vertical distribution characteristics of leaf using wheat(Triticum aesti-vum L.) cultivars in compact-high,compact-short,intermediate,and loose plant types with three nitrogen rates in two growing seasons.The leaf-type characteristics at the stages of stem elongation,flowering and grain-filling,and the vertical distribution characteristics of leaf and light within canopy at flowering were measured.Significant differences were observed among geno-types for leaf-type characteristics,and the regulating effects of nitrogen rate varied with leaf-type traits and growth stages.Single leaf area changed in a double-peak curve from canopy base to top.A gradually decreasing tendency with increasing canopy height was found in angle between stem and leaf(ABSL).The maximum leaf area index was located at 0.60 relative canopy height.Light transmission rate increased from the base to top of canopy,and presented a good fitness to quadratic polynomial curve.Sin-gle leaf area increased with increasing nitrogen rate,with greater increments in Yangmai 12 and Huaimai 17 than in Ningmai 9 and Aikang 58.The ABSL enhanced with the increasing nitrogen rate.The nitrogen regulation effects on ABSL of Ningmai 9,Huaimai 17,and Yangmai 12 were stronger at canopy base than at canopy top,but Aikang 58 showed a reverse pattern.With the increase of nitrogen rate,leaf area index accumulation at different relative canopy heights increased,while light transmission de-creased.The smaller decline of light transmission in Ningmai 9 and Aikang 58 was observed than those in Yangmai 12 and Huai-mai 17 when more nitrogen was applicated.The transmittance rate decreased in an exponential pattern with increasing leaf area index accumulation.The grain yield ranked in the order of treatments supplied 150(N150),225(N225) and 75(N75) kg ha-1.Nitrogen fertilization increased remarkably spike number and harvest index,excluding 1000-grain weight.The grain number per spike was the highest in the N225 treatment,follwded by the N75 treatment.Four wheat cultivars with different plant types dif-fered markedly in grain yield,spike number,grain number per spike,and harvest index.The grain yields were ranked as Aikang 58 > Ningmai 9 > Yangmai 12 > Huaimai 17.These results may provide a technical basis for optimizing nitrogen application to wheat cultivars with different plant types.",

In our construction, we generate each user's partial private key in the form of an MIHNPwE instance.

        "abstract": "An ion chromatographic method with on-line sample pretreatment was developed for the trace analysis of seven common anions in concentrated matrices. The pretreatment column used in this study consisted of polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). It was too hydrophobic to retain different inorganic anions, but it showed a strong affinity for organic compounds. Thus, this chromatographic system could be used to detect trace anions in organic solvents, organic acids and relevant salts. The addition of MWCNTs decreased the surface areas of stationary phases and the retention times of organic matrices were shortened. Compared with conventional column-switching technique, only a single instrument (ICS2100) was needed in this system, including a pump, a conductivity detector, an eluent generator, a six-port valve and a ten-port valve. An electrochemical self-generating suppressor (ESGS) was adopted to convert the eluent of KOH into water for the matrix elimination. Two different eluent were employed in the chromatographic system, one for separation and the other for matrix elimination. The sample pretreatment and analysis were realized simultaneously. After optimization of this system, a calibration study was conducted by preparing and analyzing eight concentrations (between 5 and 5000 μg L(-1)) of mixture standards of seven anions in deionized water. The linearity was between 0.9990 and 0.9998, and the detection limits ranged from 0.41 to 3.17 μg L(-1). A spiking study was performed on three representative organic chemicals with satisfactory recoveries between 88.1% and 118.5% when the concentrations of the matrices did not exceed 10 g L(-1).",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel anionic adsorbent based on graphene oxide-coated polymer composite particles was synthesized by grafting with poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM). The composite polymer particles (PS@GO) were prepared by coating an appropriate amount of graphene oxide (GO) sheets onto poly(styrene-divinyl benzene-glycidylmethacrylate) (PS-GMA) beads. PAMAM dendrimers were synthesized by the polymerization of ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate, and then grafted to the surface of PS@GO particles. Finally, the adsorbent was treated with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE) and characterized using various techniques. In the application, the adsorption capability of the synthesized adsorbent was investigated using the breakthrough curve method. According to the results, the adsorption capabilities were concluded to increase with increasing GO load and increasing PAMAM generation. Furthermore, this novel synthesized adsorbent was successfully used as a stationary phase for simultaneous isocratic separation of inorganic and organic anions in ion chromatography.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a very problematic pathogen over the past decades, with a high incidence in nosocomial infections. Discovered in the late 1940s but abandoned in the 1970s, polymyxins (i.e., polymyxin B and colistin) have been revived as the last-line therapy against Gram-negative \"superbugs,\" including MDR A. baumannii. Worryingly, resistance to polymyxins in A. baumannii has been increasingly reported, urging the development of novel antimicrobial therapies to rescue this last-line class of antibiotics. In the present study, we integrated genome-scale metabolic modeling with multiomics data to elucidate the mechanisms of cellular responses to colistin treatment in A. baumannii. A genome-scale metabolic model, ATCC19606, was constructed for strain ATCC 19606 based on the literature and genome annotation, containing 897 genes, 1,270 reactions, and 1,180 metabolites. After extensive curation, prediction of growth on 190 carbon sources using ATCC19606 achieved an overall accuracy of 84.3% compared to Biolog experimental results. Prediction of gene essentiality reached a high accuracy of 86.1% and 82.7% compared to two transposon mutant libraries of AB5075 and ATCC 17978, respectively. Further integrative modeling with our correlative transcriptomics and metabolomics data deciphered the complex regulation on metabolic responses to colistin treatment, including (i) upregulated fluxes through gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis; (ii) downregulated TCA cycle and peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biogenesis; and (iii) altered fluxes over respiratory chain. Our results elucidated the interplay of multiple metabolic pathways under colistin treatment in A. baumannii and provide key mechanistic insights into optimizing polymyxin combination therapy.  Combating antimicrobial resistance has been highlighted as a critical global health priority. Due to the drying drug discovery pipeline, polymyxins have been employed as the last-line therapy against Gram-negative \"superbugs\"; however, the detailed mechanisms of antibacterial killing remain largely unclear, hampering the improvement of polymyxin therapy. Our integrative modeling using the constructed genome-scale metabolic model ATCC19606 and the correlative multiomics data provide the fundamental understanding of the complex metabolic responses to polymyxin treatment in A. baumannii at the systems level. The model ATCC19606 may have a significant potential in antimicrobial systems pharmacology research in A. baumannii.",

By the employment of the column-switching technique combined with a polymer-based reversed-phase column (An IonPac NG1 guard column), organic residues in the aqueous extracts of biodiesel samples could be on-line removed automatically before flowing into analytical columns. An IonPac AG 11–HC guard column and IonPac AS 11–HC separation column were utilized for the anion separation, whereas an IonPac CG 12A guard column and IonPac CS12A was utilized for cations. Under the optimized separation conditions, a series of standard solutions consisting of nine anions of various concentrations from 0.05 to 40 mg/kg were analyzed with correlation coefficients r ≥ 0.9990, as well as six cations of various concentrations from 0.05 to 20 mg/kg.

The 810 and 870 nm are two common spectral wavebands indicating LNA in both wheat and rice. Among all ratio vegetation indices (RVI), difference vegetation indices (DVI) and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) of 16 wavebands from the MSR16 radiometer, RVI (870, 660) and RVI (810, 660) were most highly correlated to LNA in both wheat and rice. In addition, the relations between VIs and LNA gave better results than relations between single wavebands and LNA in both wheat and rice. Thus LNA in both wheat and rice could be indicated with common VIs, but separate regression equations are better for LNA monitoring.",

Methods: Guinea pigs were treated with estradiol benzoate 100 μg · d-1, twice a week, by intramuscular injection for 12 weeks. After the animal were killed, the uteri were dissected out and ultrathin sections were obtained. Compare to that of human being, pathohistologic characteristics were observed under the microscope. Results: The uteri treated with estrogen were proliferated and deformated. Uterine nodules were observed in many of the tested animals. According to the results of pathohistology, these cells demonstrate the features of smooth muscle-like cells. Conclusion: The uterine leiomyoma induced by estrodiol in guinea pig is similar to that of human being. It has been suggested that the animal model is valuable for pathogenesis research and drug screen analysis, although it still needs more evidence to be demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a method for covalent quaternization of porous carbon nanospheres (PCNSs) and their application as anion exchanging stationary phase for ion chromatography. The PCNSs were covalently quaternized via the dehydration condensation between surface carboxyl groups and polyethyleneimine. This was followed by a repeated epoxy-amine addition reaction with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether. As a result, surface methylamino groups are formed. The electrostatic interaction between quaternized PCNSs and sulfonated poly(polystyrene-co-divinylbenzene) resulted in the formation of an agglomerated stationary phase. The capacities (41.5-90.2 μequiv) and pressures (540-1150 psi) of column packed with novel phases (100 × 4.0 mm i.d.) were further increased with grafted polymer layer counts (2-5). Common inorganic anions, small organic acids and saccharides were rapidly separated on the new phases. The column efficiencies for seven inorganic anions ranged from 38,400 to 13,200 plates m. Through 8 days of flushing test, the RSD values for retention time and efficiencies varied from 0.56% to 1.32%, and from 0.34% to 0.74%, respectively. Graphical abstract Schematic presentation of the covalent modification of porous carbon nanospheres (PCNSs) with hyperbranched quaternized polymers via the amidation and epoxy-amine addition reaction was depicted. Functionalized PCNSs were further applied as agglomerated materials of polymeric stationary phase for ion chromatography (IC).",

        "abstract": "The objectives of the present study were to explore new sensitive spectral bands and ratio spectral indices based on precise analysis of ground-based hyperspectral information, and then develop regression model for estimating leaf N accumulation per unit soil area (LNA) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Three field experiments were conducted with different N rates and cultivar types in three consecutive growing seasons, and time-course measurements were taken on canopy hyperspectral reflectance and LNA tinder the various treatments. By adopting the method of reduced precise sampling, the detailed ratio spectral indices (RSI) within the range of 350-2 500 nm were constructed, and the quantitative relationships between LNA (gN m(-2)) and RSI (i, j) were analyzed. It was found that several key spectral bands and spectral indices were suitable for estimating LNA in wheat, and the spectral parameter RSI (990, 720) was the most reliable indicator for LNA in wheat. The regression model based on the best RSI was formulated as y = 5.095x - 6.040, with R2 of 0.814. From testing of the derived equations with independent experiment data, the model on RSI (990, 720) had R2 of 0.847 and RRMSE of 24.7%. Thus, it is concluded that the present hyperspectral parameter of RSI (990, 720) and derived regression model can be reliably used for estimating LNA in winter wheat. These results provide the feasible key bands and technical basis for developing the portable instrument of monitoring wheat nitrogen status and for extracting useful spectral information from remote sensing images.",

        "abstract": "The trace anions in heteropoly acid can be determined by ion chromatography. However, phosphate could hardly be accurately determined due to the decomposition of heteropoly acid under alkaline condition in regular eluent such as Na_2CO_3, NaOH. This problem can be solved by adding proper amount of 2-(cyclohexylamion )ethane sulfonic acid (CHES) to adjust the pH of the eluent so as to prevent the heteropoly acid from discomposing. The optimum condition for determining phosphate, chloride and sulfate in heteropoly acid was 2.5 mmol/L Na_2CO_3-9.0 mmol/L CHES which was found by comparing the determination results of phosphate in samples diluted by re-distilled water and eluent respectively.",

The system realized the functions as basic map handling, information management, cultural plan design, fertilizer and water management, pest-disease-weed management, suitable dynamic indices design, real-time regulation based on growth status, expert consultation, and system help, etc. Case studies on the system in the rice field experiments in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, China indicated that the average yield under the precision management plan was 10 464.8 kg/hm2, 12.53% over that in the general plan (9 299.5 kg/hm2). Moreover, the amount of nitrogen fertilizer decreased by 31.5 kg/hm2, as comparing to the general plan. The present work has provided a modeling and systematized decision tool for the design of rice production management prescription, and a basal framework for developing other crop management decision support system.",

The dynamic content of albumin with growing degree days (GDD) after anthesis could be described with a power model, and the contents of gliadlin and glutenin could be described with a logarithmic model. The effects of nitrogen and water conditions on grain protein components were quantified with nitrogen and water factors. The model was validated with independent experiment data. 【Result】 The mean RMSEs of four grain protein components during filling stage under different temperatures were 0.44%, 0.58%, 0.53% and 0.59%, respectively, and the mean RMSEs at maturity were 0.41%, 0.56%, 0.75% and 0.56%, respectively. 【Conclusion】The results indicate that the present model has a good performance in predicting dynamic contents of grain protein components in wheat, which have laid a foundation for simulating wheat grain quality and improving wheat growth system.",

        "abstract": "By the method of statistics, this paper approached the quantitative relationships between leaf total nitrogen concentration (LNC) and canopy reflectance spectra of rice, based on the data from 5-year field experiments involving different varieties and nitrogen fertilization rates. The results showed that the LNC had higher correlations with the key spectral parameters of two bands than of single band. The relative, differential, and normalized difference vegetation indicies ( RVI, DVI, NDVI) of the bands in near infrared (760-1 220 nm) and visible light 510 nm, 560 nm, 680 nm and 710 nm all showed significantly positive correlations to LNC, and NDVI showed the best. All the parameters having significant correlations with LNC were selected to compare the R2 and SE in the regression equations with LNC, which confirmed that the NDVI of R1220, and R710 was the best parameter for predicting the LNC. The quantitative equation LNC = 3.2708 × NDVI (1220, 710) + 0.8654 was tested by the data from other three field experiments with different rice cultivars, water conditions and nitrogen fertilization rates, and the estimated R, slope, and RMSE were ranged in 0.674-0.862, 0.908-1.010 and 11.315%-19.491%, respectively, indicating a good fit between the predicted and observed values of LNCs, which suggested that this model was feasible for predicting the LNC of rice under different cultivation conditions.",

        "abstract": "To realize non-destructive and real-time monitoring of crop nitrogen status for precision management in rice fertilization, we characterized the reflectance spectra in the red edge area from ground- and space-based data, and quantified the relationships between the red edge position (REP) derived from different algorithms and canopy leaf nitrogen concentrations (LNC) at various nitrogen rates in four seasons in various cultivars of field-grown rice (Oryza sativa L.). The results showed that the spectrum in the red edge area was significantly affected by the nitrogen level and cultivar type, and \"three-peak\" feature could be observed in the first derivative spectrum in this area. Traditional REP (maximum value of the first derivative spectra in red-edge region) was not sensitive to canopy LNC because of the three-peak property, but the REPs based on inverted Gaussian fitting, linear four-point interpolation, linear extrapolation and adjusted linear extrapolation generated continuous REP values, and could be used for estimating canopy LNC. REP from a three-point Lagrangian interpolation with three first-derivative bands (690 nm, 700 nm and 705 nm) had a good relationship with canopy LNC. Among the six REP approaches, REP based on adjusted linear extrapolation algorithm was found to have the best relations with canopy LNCs in Hyperion image data. Comparison of the different REPs with both ground-based and space-borne hyperspectral data indicated that the adjusted linear extrapolation method (755FD 730+675FD 700)/(FD 730+FD 700) proposed here gave the best prediction of canopy LNC. This simple and reliable REP approach to monitoring canopy LNC in rice requires further verification with other hyperspectral sensors and crop types.",

Except those in the normal control group, rats in the rest groups were induced to establish the AA model by intradermally injecting Freund's complete adjuvant into their right paws. The medication was started from the 19th day. Normal saline was administered to rats in the normal control group and the model group. MTX, TGT, and XC was respectively administered to rats in the MTX, TGT, and XC groups. The medication lasted for 30 days. The swelling degree of voix pedis, arthritis index (AI), the heart function, serum levels of cytokines, and the myocardial ultrastructure were observed.(1) Compared with the normal control group, the swelling degree of voix pedis and AI significantly increased (P < 0.01), the body weight significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the model group and the other 3 treated groups. (2) Compared with the model group, the heart index (HI), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) significantly decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure of development or decline (+/- dp/dt(max)) significantly increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the MTX treated group, the LVSP and LVEDP significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and +/- dp/dtmax significantly increased (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with the model group, TNF-alpha, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and IL-17 significantly decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01); IL-10, CD4+, CD4+ CDA25+ significantly increased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the MTX treated group, IL-17 significantly decreased (P < 0.05), CD4+ CD25+ expression significantly increased in the XC group (P < 0.05). (4) Transmission electron microscopy showed that myocardial ultrastructure was basically contact in the XC treated group, approaching to that of the normal control group.Decreased cardiac function and damaged myocardial ultrastructure existed in AA rats. XFC could ameliorate the swelling degree of voix pedis and AI, as well as improve the heart function. Its mechanisms might be correlated with down-regulating serum levels of inflammatory factors, up-regulating the expressions of anti-inflammation factors, thus improving the myocardial ultrastructure and protecting injured myocardial cells.",

By combining the techniques of linear pixel unmixing and data assimilation, the LAI based on SPOT-5 image with high spatial resolution was used to adjust the time-series LAI based on HJ-CCD image with high temporal resolution, and LAI series covering the whole winter wheat growth period and with high spatial and temporal resolutions were generated. The effects of pixel purity and the number of high spatial image on the performance of fusing method were analyzed by comparing the LAI with fusing method and LAI from SPOT-5 image or observed LAI. The results showed that the estimated LAI with fusing method has high consistency with observed LAI and the pixel purity is main obstacle factor. The fusion results based on two scenes of SPOT-5 images are better than that based on one image. These results can provide an important technical support for monitoring of growth in winter wheat.",

        "abstract": "Boundary formation is crucial for organ development in multicellular eukaryotes. In higher plants, boundaries that separate the organ primordia from their surroundings have relatively low rates of cell proliferation. This cellular feature is regulated by the actions of certain boundary-specifying genes, whose ectopic expression in organs can cause inhibition of organ growth. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 and 2 (AS1 and AS2) and JAGGED (JAG) genes function in the sepal and petal primordia to repress boundary-specifying genes for normal development of the organs. Loss-of-function as1 jag and as2 jag double mutants produced extremely tiny sepals and petals. Analysis of a cell-cycle marker HISTONE4 revealed that cell division in sepal primordia of the double mutant was inhibited. Moreover, these abnormal sepals and petals exhibited ectopic overexpression of the boundary-specifying genes PETAL LOSS (PTL) and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDONS1 and 2 (CUC1 and CUC2). Loss of PTL or CUC1 and CUC2 functions in the as1 jag background could partially rescue the tiny sepal and petal phenotypes, supporting the model that the tiny sepal/petal phenotypes are caused, at least in part, by ectopic expression of boundary-specifying genes. Together, our data reveal a previously unrecognized fundamental regulation by which AS1, AS2, and JAG act to define sepal and petal from their boundaries. In higher plants, formation of organ primordia re- quires creation of boundaries that separate an organ primordium from surrounding tissues. Morphological boundaries between the meristem and organs are termed M-O boundaries, whereas those between ad-",

The monolithic silica capillary columns were prepared by a sol-gel process in fused-silica capillaries with an inner diameter of 50 mum and subsequently in situ immobilization of vancomycin as a chiral selector by reductive amination. Enantioselectivity was obtained for eight pairs of enantiomers in nonaqueous polar organic or aqueous mobile phases and most of them were baseline-separated with high column efficiencies. It was observed that the organic modifier ratio (MeOH/ACN) in the polar organic mobile phase played a significant role in controlling the resolution and efficiency of the enantiomers. In enantiomeric separation of propranolol, repeatability for column efficiency and resolution in the nonaqueous mobile phase was given in terms of RSD values at 1.1 and 2.3% (n = 5) for run-to-run injections and 7.2 and 9.6% (n = 5) for column-to-column testing while repeatability for the separation of thalidomide in the aqueous mobile phase was given in terms of RSD values at 1.5, 2.8% and 6.1, 10.5%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】 Modeling dynamics of the dry matter partitioning among unit organs (leaf, sheath, internode and panicle) in rice is an important task for realizing virtual and digital plant growth. In the past years, some great progresses had been made on the dynamics of dry matter partitioning among leaves, stem and sheath, and panicles of rice, but the dry matter partitioning among unit organs of plant was seldom addressed. The present study was conducted to develop a simulation model on the dry matter partitioning dynamics for various unit organs of rice having relation to GDD. 【Method】Four experiments were carried out involving different nitrogen rates and water regimes with four rice cultivars, and time-course observations were made on the dry matter changes in different unit organs on stem and tillers. 【Result】The results showed that the dynamic change of the unit organ partitioning index could be characterized by linear and exponential equation, respectively for leaf, internode and sheath, and panicle in relation to accumulated GDD. The changes in the maximum partitioning index for unit organ could be described by exponential equation (unit leaf and sheath) and quadratic equation (unit panicle) with different leaf, internode and sheath and panicle positions on main stem and tillers. In addition, the effects of nitrogen and water conditions on the dry weight and partitioning index for unit organs were quantified through the effectiveness values of nitrogen concentration and water content in unit organs. The model was validated by the independent field experiment data involving different rice cultivars and nitrogen rates. The average RMSEs between the simulated and observed values for the dry weights of unit organs on main stem and tillers under varied nitrogen and water levels with different cultivars were 0.93, 0.81, and 6.8 kg·ha-1 for leaf, internode and sheath, and panicle, respectively. 【Conclusion】The results indicated that the present model had a good performance in predicting the dynamic changes in the dry weight and partitioning index for different unit organs in rice under different growth conditions, and thus it will be a foundation for further constructing digital and visual organ growth system in rice.",

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red(AR) stainings were used to detect the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMMSC. The mRNA expression of EphB4, IGF-1 and OPG in BMMSC was measured by real-time PCR. The immunohistochemistry was employed to measure the expression of bone morphgenetic protein-2(BMP-2) and p-Smad1/5/8 in BMMSC. Furthermore, the Western blot was used for the detection of iκBα and phospho-iκBα (p-ikBα) in IL-1β-treated BMMSC. And the results of IL-1β-treated BMMSC were compared with control group.Compared with control group, the osteogenetic potential of IL-1β-treated BMMSC was enhanced, but the pro-osteogenic differentiation effect of IL-1β was remarkedly inhibited in the presence of NF-kB pathway inhibitor PDTC. The total ikBα level of IL-1β-treated BMMSC was lower (P<0.05), and phospho-iκBα (p-iκBα) level was higher (P<0.05). Besides, BMP-2 expression was higher (P<0.05) in the IL-1β-treated BMMSC, however, p-Smad1/5/8 protien level was not significantly different among IL-1β-treated for 1 d, 7 d and control groups (P<0.05). And the mRNA expression levels of IGF-1, EphB4 and OPG in BMMSC were up-regulated after IL-1β treatment (P<0.05). In addition, the osteoblastogenesis of BMMSC treated with IL-1β for 7 days was significantly different from those treated only for 1 day.Prolonging IL-1β treatment can enhance the osteogenetic differentiation of BMMSC more significantly. And this osteogenetic alteration of BMMSC occurs via its NF-κB pathway, but not via BMP-2/Smad pathway.",

The influences of surface ageing time, surface pressure, dilational frequency and bulk concentration on surface rheological properties have been expounded. It is found that the whole hydrophilic part of betaine molecule inclines to flat on the surface when betaine adsorbs, which will lead to higher dilational modulus. The nature of adsorption film is determined by in-surface processes, such as the variation of orientation of hydrophilic group. The branched hydrophobic alkyl chains of betaine molecules improve the intermolecular interactions, not only results in higher moduli, but causes a maximum in dynamic elastic modulus at high concentration. This indicates that the strength of surface film is strongly related to molecular arrangement, not simply determined by the surface molecule concentration. When ethylene oxide groups are incorporated in the hydrophobic group, the enhancement of steric hindrance will decrease both elastic modulus and viscous modulus.",

When jamming is needed, the data in DRFM are convoluted with the received radar signals, and then the result signals are retransmitted. Radar signals having been processed a composite map including the real and the jamming information is gotten.

        "abstract": "Abstract   The effects of alkalis on the dynamic interfacial tensions (IFTs) of two betaine solutions with different hydrophilic parts, erucyl dimethyl amidopropyl carboxybetaine (EDAC) and erucyl dimethyl amidopropyl sulfobetaine (EDAS), against crude oil and model oils containing crude oil fractions (such as saturate, aromatic, resin, asphaltene and acidic fractions) have been investigated by spinning drop tensiometer. The experimental results show that the IFTs of EDAC solutions against decane are slightly lower than those of EDAS solutions because the hydrophilic part of EDAS is larger than that of EDAC. The crude oil fractions can directly adsorb at the interface to form mixed film with betaine molecules and drastically reduce IFT values. This synergistic effect becomes better with the enhancement of surface activity of fractions. The adding of alkali will improve the synergistic effects between betaines and fractions in general by enhancing the adsorption of fractions and producing soaps. EDAS molecules have synergistic effects with both fractions and soaps, while EDAC molecules show synergistic effect mainly with fractions, because of the difference of hydrophilic parts. Therefore, after adding different alkalis, the IFTs of EDAS solutions are obviously lower than those of EDAC solutions for almost all model oils. The dependence of size-compatibility becomes unimportant for the synergistic effect between betaines and crude oil in reducing IFT and pH value plays the most crucial role in controlling synergistic effect. Ultralow IFT values can be reached for both two betaines during a wide range of alkali concentrations.",

        "abstract": "Based on the field experiments with different rice varieties and nitrogen application rates, a comprehensive analysis was made on the quantitative relationships between hyperspectral vegetation indices of rice canopy and its leaf nitrogen concentration ( LNC) at different rice growth stages. The wave bands most sensitive to the canopy LNC were in red region (665-675 nm) , blue region (490-500 nm), and red edge region (680-760 nm). Within the range of 400-2500 nm, the wave bands showing the best relationships between rice canopy vegetation indices and LNC were 550 -600 nm and 500-550 nm in green region, and the ratio index SR(533, 565) had the highest value of determination coefficient (R2). However, the spectral parameter established with three wavelengths in blue region, i. e. , blue nitrogen index R434/( A 496+A401 ) , had a significant linear relationship with the canopy LNC, and made the prediction accuracy of the canopy LNC promoted significantly, compared with SR ( 533, 565 ). The tests with independent datasets showed that A434/ (A496+A401) was a reliable indicator of rice canopy LNC, with the RMSE and RE values between measured and estimated LNC being 9.67% and 8% , respectively. Therefore, the newly developed blue nitrogen index R434/(R496 +R 401 ) was recommended as a good indicator of rice canopy LNC.",

        "abstract": "In China, air pollution is getting worse, and the adverse effect of formaldehyde on human health has been attracting more and more attention. The present work proposes a novel, fast and sensitive analytical method for the determination of formaldehyde in the air of public places. This method was based on the determination of the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH)–formaldehyde condensation product of the derivatization between formaldehyde and MBTH. The actual formaldehyde concentration in air was determined by leading the test atmosphere through a bubble absorption tube containing the MBTH absorption solution and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Recoveries of spiked formaldehyde samples were in the range of 92.2–106% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 5.0%. The limit of detection (LOD) of formaldehyde in air samples was 0.05 μg m−3, which was much lower than that of the state standard method of China for the determination of formaldehyde in the air of public places (5.6 μg m−3). The satisfactory validation results and the application to the analysis of formaldehyde in the air of a hotel and subway station demonstrated the applicability to air quality monitoring analysis.",

The detection limits were about 0.4～2.3μg/L,RSDs were less than 4%and the recoveries were about 88.1%～109.5%.In conclusion,this column-switching technique is simple to use and with high accuracy, thus,is very useful for on-line sample pretreatment.",

The results showed that the integration of the NDVI at heading stage with above-mentioned soil nutrient indices produced the best results of wheat growth management zone defining, with the variation coefficients of NDVI and soil nutrient indices in each defined zone ranged in 4. 5%-6. 1% and 3. 3%-87. 9%, respectively. However, the variation coefficients were much larger when the wheat growth management zones were defined individually by NDVI or by soil nutrient indices, suggesting that the newly developed defining method could reduce the variability within the defined management zones and improve the crop management precision, and thereby, contribute to the winter wheat growth management and process simulation at regional scale.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effect and adverse reaction of oral fludarabine in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Methods: Fifteen patients included 10 CLL patients and 5 SLL patients, and their media age was 63 years. According to Rai staging, 5 CLL patients were in stage Ⅱ, 2 in stage Ⅲ and 3 in stage Ⅳ. According to the clinical staging, there were 4 SLL patients in stage Ⅲ and 1 in stage Ⅲ. Eleven patients were previously untreated while 5 were treated. All the patients received oral fludarabine 40mg/(m~2·d) for five consecutive days, repeated every 4 weeks for 4 cycles at least. Twelve patients went through 4 courses of treatment, and the other 3 patients continuously received one or two courses of consolidation therapy. Results: The average course of the 15 patients was 4.3. The rate of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and overall response (OR) were 66.7% (10/ 15), 26.6% (4/15) and 93.3% (14/15) respectively, and one had no response to treatment. Nine of eleven previously untreated patients achieved CR while PR was obtained in one. And one died because of disease progression. Among four previously treated patients, one achieved CR and three achieved PR. The main adverse reactions were myelosuppression and infection. Grade Ⅰ～Ⅲ neutropenia were found in 5 (33.3%) patients in which 1 was with grade Ⅰ, 3 with grade Ⅱ and 1 with grade Ⅲ. Infection occurred in 3 (20%) patients. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. All the adverse reactions were reversible. Conclusion: The oral fludarabine is an effective, safe regimen in patients with CLL/SLL. It is also effective to the previously treated patients. The adverse reactions are mild. The oral fludarabine is a recommendable therapy for the patients with CLL/SLL.",

        "abstract": "On the diversity and heterogeneity of crop model system, the integration method based on Web service was studied. By analyzing the architecture of crop model system and interactive features between function module, service partitioning based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) was studied. Combining with Web service identification and segmentation principle, the partition and the service combination structure of crop model based on Web service was proposed. Then the model system was divided three Web service including Web service of model calculation, Web service of weather data and Web service of soil data. The service package using \"contract first\" Web services development technology was designed. The modeling process based on web services contract-first (WSCF) was described in details and the automatic generation of Web services description language (WSDL) Deed and services code framework was achieved by use of related tools. The knowledge model system for wheat management as an instance was reused through four steps based on Web services, and the concrete package steps were service data modeling based on crop model metadata, service information modeling, service operation and the interface modeling, and service implementation using C# language under VS2008 ASP.Net platform. Taking the reused knowledge model system for wheat management based on Web service as the testing target, the effectiveness was verified in a real network environment. The output solution of the system was consistent with the result of the original knowledge model system for wheat management using weather data and soil data of 75 cities at prefectural level of Jiangsu province in year 2010. It showed that the crop models system integration method adopts unified model service contract, making full use of the cross platform and cross programming language advantage, which promoted the efficiency of the model system integration, which solves the problem of interoperability between heterogeneous systems. The crop model system of Web service encapsulation, making full use of the crop model resource of software components, the development of relevant documents and other resources, which improved the reuse level of crop model resource. Analysis from the point of view of model of business functions, reassignment and development services were independent, and the designment of the service through the WSDL addressed specific requirements, which shielded the underlying technical details and related agricultural domain specialized knowledge and improved the application of crop model. These results provide a methodological guideline for crop model system integration.",

        "abstract": "Identification of paddy fields is essential for monitoring the rice cultivated area and predicting rice productivity. Timely and accurate extraction of rice distribution can bring vital information for national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and regional environmental sustainability. Conventional classification methods usually suffered from low accuracy, multi-class training samples, or demanding imagery requirements. This paper proposes to use one-class support vector classification (OCSVC) to extract rice cultivated area with Landsat Optical Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Instead of sampling and training all land cover types as performed by multi-class classification methods, OCSVC only used the training samples of target class (rice) for rice mapping. The performance of OCSVC was evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy of rice mapping and rice acreage estimation based on high-resolution imagery, field survey data and rice acreage data from government reports for Jiangsu Province, China. At the county-level, OCSVC was also compared with the commonly used multi-class support vector classification (MCSVC), decision tree classification (DTC), and vegetation index-based thresholding (VIT). Our results demonstrated that OCSVC produced a comparable overall accuracy to DTC and outperformed MCSVC and VIT. The computational efficiency of OCSVC increased approximately ten times as compared to MCSVC. The OCSVC produced the best correlation between its classified area and reported area among the four classification methods evaluated. When applied to the provincial level, the classification overall accuracy for OCSVC was 88.54%. The detected rice planting area for Jiangsu Province was 22,602 km2, which was consistent with the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics (22,948 km2). This OCSVC-based mapping strategy provides a practical and efficient way to detect the rice planting extent with Landsat imagery at a large scale.",

This 9-month, prospective, non-controlled, intervention study comprised two phases: a 3-month pre-intervention phase (Phase I) and a 6-month intervention phase (Phase II), during which the use of third-/forth-generation cephalosporins was restricted and replaced by piperacillin-tazobactam. Rectal swabs were obtained within 24 h after admission (baseline screening), weekly, and 48 h before discharge during Phase I and the last 3 months of Phase II (Phase IIb). Swabs were tested for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and extended spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected with the double disc test. Use of third/fourth-generation cephalosporins decreased by 63.0% and 100%, respectively; while the use of piperacillin-tazobactam increased by 28-fold. The rate of acquisition of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae together in rectal swab specimens decreased in Phase IIb as compared with Phase I (19.5% vs 29.5%). Few rectal swab specimens were positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamases-producing K. pneumoniae, and no substantial decrease in the rate of its acquisition was observed.",

        "abstract": "The correction of spatial scaling bias on the estimate of leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from remotely sensed data is an essential issue in quantitative remote sensing for vegetation monitoring. We analyzed three techniques, including Taylor’s theorem (TT), Wavelet-Fractal technique (WF), and Fractal theory (FT), for correcting the scaling bias of LAI with empirical models in different functions (i.e., power, exponential, logarithmic and polynomial) on both simulated data and a real dataset over a cropland site. The results demonstrated that the scaling bias became greater when the model non-linearity increased. The spatial heterogeneity, which was characterized by the class-specific proportion, the between-class spectral difference and the number of classes within each coarse pixel, was found to be the primary factor in the scaling effect. These factors influenced the scaling effect collectively and existed dependently. With the RMSE less than 0.3 × 10−6 m2/m2, TT was suggested for the correction with a polynomial LAI-NDVI functions. WF was preferred for neighboring scales rather than continuous scales. FT was not recommended for correcting the scaling bias caused by the significant non-linearity in LAI estimation models. This study illustrates the main causes of the scaling effect and provides a reference of technique selection for scaling bias correction to improve the application of remotely sensed estimates.",

Using systematic analysis method and dynamic modeling technology, a SPAD-based leaf color dynamic model was developed to simulate time-course change characters of leaf SPAD on wheat plant. 【Result】The leaf color dynamic could be described with three phases in SPAD. The first phase in SPAD during leaf growth period was based on the quadratic relationship of leaf color to growing degree days (GDD), the second phase during leaf function period was represented with a relative stable SPAD, and the third phase during leaf senescence period was described in a quadratic equation between SPAD and GDD. In addition, the effect of nitrogen status on leaf SPAD was quantified by the value of leaf nitrogen concentration, and the relationship between SPAD and RGB was described with linear equation. The model was validated with the independent field experiment data of different winter wheat cultivars. The average RMSEs of time-course leaf SPAD on stem and tiller were 11.60% and 9.03%, respectively. 【Conclusion】 Thus, the present model has a good performance in predicting leaf color on wheat plant, laying a foundation for further constructing virtual leaf growth system of wheat.",

        "abstract": "The covalent modification of polymeric particles has been a challenge due to their chemical inertness. Herein we describe a facile and neat method via thiol-ene reaction to immobilize cysteamine/cysteine onto allylmethacrylate-divinylbenzene (AMA-DVB) and ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene (EVB-DVB). The introduced functionalities were verified by elementary analysis and scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy. This modification enabled the further grafting of hyperbranched condensation polymers (HBCPs), which converted the particles into anion exchangers. The anion exchangers demonstrated good separation with carbonate/bicarbonate eluents and hydroxide eluents for suppressed anion exchange chromatography. In the case of a 3-layered anion exchanger, simultaneous separation of nine model anions was achieved by isocratic elution in 17 min with efficiencies up to 16,100 plates m. High stability and dependable durability was exhibited in long-term tests.",

Implants were removed after medical therapy which was proved to be ineffective. ·RESULTS: Ten of 250 cases of HA orbital implants developed pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granuloma occurred in 1 unpegged implants patient and 9 patients after pegging and drilling of HA implantation over 4～7 years. The pyogenic granulomas were not controlled by medical therapy effectively. Implants were removed in 9 cases except 1 case denied removing and continued medical therapy. ·CONCLUSION: Pyogenic granuloma was serious complication that occurred after HA orbital implants. Partial vascularization, implant exposure, xenogenic sclera implant, pegging and drilling of HA implantation are risk factors that affect the development of pyogenic granuloma.Pyogenic granuloma hasn't relation with implanted peg material. Pyogenic granuloma denotes the potential implant infection, and all implants should be removed finally.",

In this platform, the ABAC provides flexible and diverse authorization mechanisms for digital asset escrowed into blockchain while the blockchainu0027s transactions serve as verifiable and traceable medium of access request procedure. We also present four types of transactions to describe the TBAC access control procedure, and provide the algorithms of these transactions corresponding to subject registration, object escrowing and publication, access request and grant.

        "abstract": "Motivated by the common practice that competitive retailers usually transship inventories between each other to increase sales, this article studies the optimal transshipment policies of two retailers selling a same kind of seasonal or fashionable products in a same market. In the problem under investigation, before the selling period begins, both retailers hold a certain quantity of initial inventories that are non-replenishable during the selling process. Once one of the retailers has run out of its inventory, it can rely on the inventory that is transshipped from the other retailer to fulfill its customer. However, as a self-revenue maximizer, the other retailer can reject any transshipment requests. On basis of a discrete-time dynamic programming model, we study the optimal transshipment policies of the two retailers, and characterize the structural properties of their revenue functions. Moreover, we conduct a comparison of the decentralized system with the centralized system where both retailers seek to maximize their joint revenue. Numerical experiments show that though transshipment can increase revenue for both retailers, however, the competition between the retailers can induce a great total revenue loss.",

Methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine and triethylamine were selected to prepare the quaternary ammonium groups of anion exchangers, respectively. The diameters and surface characteristics of microspheres were measured by scanning electron microscope and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The anion exchangers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrum, elemental analysis and breakthrough curve methods. The chromatographic performances of anion exchangers were illustrated by separating conventional anions, organic weak acids and carbohydrates. The results indicated that the anion exchange capacities were controllable by changing either the content of glycidylmethacrylate in microspheres or the number of bonded quaternary ammonium layer. Meanwhile, the substituents of quaternary ammonium groups greatly influenced the separation properties of anion exchangers. Finally, the three-layer methylamine-quaternized anion exchanger was successfully applied for the determination of fluoride in tea sample. The content of fluoride was detected to be 0.13mgg(-1) without the interference of acetate and formate. ",

From tillering to maturing stage, the average PAR reflectance in all treatments was 3.45%. The ratio of reflected PAR to the total loss of PAR from tillering to heading stage was 10.90%, which was significantly lower than that (22.06%) from heading to maturiting stage. The PAR conversion efficiency from tillering to maturing stage decreased with increasing planting density but increased with increasing nitrogen rate, and the conversion efficiency was significantly higher from tillering to heading than from heading to maturing stage. The PAR use efficiency from tillering to maturing stage increased with the increase of planting density and nitrogen application rate, and the average PAR use efficiency of Liangyoupeijiu (1.83 g x MJ(-1)) was significantly higher than that of Wuxiangjing 14 (1.42 g x MJ(-1)). Due to the longer growth period of Wuxiangjing 14, its incident PAR and intercepted PAR under midium and high planting densities were higher, as compared with Liangyoupeijiu. The grain yield was significantly positively correlated with the canopy PAR interceptance and use efficiency at different growth stages, but less correlated with the PAR conversion efficiency. To increase the canopy PAR use efficiency and conversion efficiency on the basis of maintaining higher PAR interception rate could be an effective way to increase rice yield.",

This paper research that except the concentration of 10 ppm, linear propylene glycol polyether appears higher moduli than those of branched polyether because branched one has shorter chain at the same molecular weight, which will result in the faster diffusion. However, at optimized concentration, the modulus of branched one is higher than that of linear one, which can be attributed to the stronger interactions between branched chains at interface. The linear demulsifier propylene glycol polyether shows stronger ability of reducing modulus for diluted crude oil with higher viscosity. On the contrary, branched demulsifier glycerol polyether acts well when concentrations of diluted crude oils are lower. The reason is that linear demulsifier has the stronger ability of adsorption and branched one shows the stronger ability of replacement of natural active fractions.",

        "abstract": "Protein concentration of grain is an important quality index of rice, and formation of grain protein largely depends on pre-anthesis\n nitrogen assimilation and post-anthesis nitrogen remobilization in the rice plant. The primary objective of this study was\n to develop a simplified process model for simulating nitrogen accumulation and remobilization in plant and protein formation\n in rice grains on the basis of an established rice growth model. Six field experiments, involving different years, eco-sites,\n varieties, nitrogen rates, and irrigation regimes, were conducted to obtain the necessary data for model building, genotypic\n parameter determination, and model validation. Using physiological development time (PDT) as general time scale of development progress and cultivar-specific grain protein concentration as genotypic parameter,\n the dynamic relationships of plant nitrogen accumulation and translocation to environmental and genetic factors were quantified\n and synthesized in the present model. The pre-anthesis nitrogen uptake rate by plant changed with the PDT in a negative exponential pattern, and post-anthesis nitrogen uptake rate changed with leaf area index (LAI) in an exponential equation. Post-anthesis nitrogen translocation rate depended on the plant nitrogen concentration and dry\n weight at anthesis as well as residue nitrogen concentration of plant at maturity. The nitrogen for protein synthesis in grains\n came from two sources: the nitrogen pre-stored in leaves, stem and sheath before anthesis and then remobilized after anthesis,\n and the nitrogen absorbed directly by plant after anthesis. Finally, the model was tested by using the data sets of different\n years, eco-sites, varieties, and N fertilization and irrigation conditions with the root mean square errors (RMSE) 0.22%–0.26%, indicating the general and reliable features of the model. It is hoped that by properly integrating with the\n existing rice growth models, the present model can be used for predicting grain protein concentration and grain protein yield\n of rice under various environments and genotypes.",

Depending on the polycondensation of methylamine and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether, polymer containing quaternary ammonium groups were facilely grafted onto the surfaces of hydrothermal carbonaceous spheres (HCSs). The quaternized HCSs with different number of polyelectrolyte layers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, brunauer-emmett-teller, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and elemental analysis. The measurements of breakthrough curves demonstrated that more layers of grafted polyelectrolyte resulted in higher anion exchange capacity of stationary phase. With good stability, common inorganic anions, monocarboxylic acids, polarizable anions and carbohydrates were effectively separated on the stationary phases, respectively. The high hydrophilicity of HCS surface afforded excellent peak symmetry for all analytes. Furthermore, high-capacity HCSs stationary phase was successfully applied to detect fluoride in tea samples.",

        "abstract": "It is of significant importance for using leaf spectral reflectance characteristics to estimate leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in crop plants.We carried out two filed experiments in Nanjing to investigate the relationships between chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and spectral reflectance characteristics in top four leaves under different nitrogen levels in wheat(Triticum aestivum L.)cultivars Ningmai 9(low protein content),Huaimai 20(medium protein content),and Yumai 34(high protein content).Experiment one was conducted with Ningmai 9 and Huaimai 20 and five nitrogen application levels of 0,75,150,225,and 300 kg ha-1 in 2003 to 2004.Experiment two was designed for Ningmai 9 and Yumai 34 with three nitrogen application levels of 0,90,and 270 kg ha-1 in 2004 to 2005.The dynamic change patterns and interrelationships between chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and spectral reflectance in top four leaves of wheat cultivars under different nitrogen levels in two years were analyzed.The results indicated that the leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fv/Fm and Fv/Fo in wheat increased with increasing nitrogen rates,whereas the leaf spectral reflectance varied distinctly with nitrogen rates,leaf positions,and growth process.The correlations between chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and spectral reflectance in the top 1st and 2nd leaves were stabilized in the ranges of visible light(520-680nm)and near infrared light(750-850 nm).The leaf reflectance spectral indices DVI(750,550),DVI(735,690)and TVI(750,670,550)were all highly correlated with the leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters Fo,Fm,Fv,Fv/Fm,Fv/Fo,Fs,F'm,F'o,F'v,and F'v/F'm in top two leaves,and the DVI(750,550)had the best correlation.In addition,there were no obvious differences on regression coefficients among different cultivars and growth stages.These results suggested that it is feasible to monitor leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters by leaf reflectance spectra in wheat.",

Using this technique, the low-level anions were eluted from the concentrator column to the analytical columns circularly, and the matrix flowed to the waste. Under the optimized separation conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 0.05-25.0 mg/L and satisfactory repeatability (RSD<4%, n=6). The limits of detection were in the range of 2-23 μg/L (S/N=3). The result showed that the cycling-column-switching system was convenient and practical for the determination of trace anions in high-salinity samples.",

Methods: A total of 46 patients with intermediate and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome was retrospectively analyzed. Twenty - eight patients received CAG regimen and 18 received conventional chemotherapy. CAG regimen: aclarubicin 10 mg/(m2 • d) intravenously daily, Day 1 ∼ 8; cytarabine 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously once every 12 hours, Day 1 ∼ 14; and subcutaneously use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 200 μg/(m2 • d) until 12 hours before the last use of cytarabine. The initial outcome was evaluated after the first course of treatment. The responders received the second course. The ultimate therapeutic effect was evaluated after the 2 courses. Results: The overall response rate in the CAG regimen group was 78. 6% (22/28). Thirteen patients (46.4%) responded, 5 (17.9%) showed partial response, and 4 (14.3%) hematologic improvement. The overall response rate in the conventional chemotherapy group was 50% (9/18). Six patients (33. 3%) achieved complete response, 2 (11. 1 %) partial response, and 1(5.6%) hematologic improvement. The overall response rate of the CAG group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0. 05). The adverse effects of CAG regimen were bearable. Conclusion: With acceptable adverse effect, CAG regimen is effective for the intermediate and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Long-time outcome needs further observation.",

        "abstract": "N-Nitrosamines (NAs) are potent carcinogens and have been found in food products. Herein we report a simple tandem liquid-phase extraction (TLPE) method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the determination of trace N-nitrosamines (NAs) in food products. The TLPE method is based upon the tandem implementation of pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) and dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME). The target analytes were first extracted with pressurized hot water, and then concentrated into an organic phase (n-octanol) in the DLLME procedure. The TLPE-HPLC system allowed the analytes to be extracted, concentrated and analyzed in a single step with minimal manipulation of the sample preparation, with an overall analysis time of 25 min. The optimized method showed good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.981) and satisfactory recoveries (74–117%) with good repeatability of the extractions (RSDs below 12.8%, n = 5). The limits of detection (LODs) for all nitrosamines in salted duck eggs were in the range of 0.08–0.55 μg kg−1.",

Based on this, a simulation model for cotton development stages and square-and boll development was built in terms of physiological development time (PDT). In calculating relative thermal effectiveness, the effect of diurnal temperature differences in different regions on cotton development was incorporated, and the enhancement of plastic mulching on air temperature was quantified. To simulate development stages, the initial fruiting node index (IFIN), sunlight duration factor (FSH), and solar radiation index on fruiting branch (IFBR) were introduced, besides earliness factor of a given genotype. The validation of the model with the data obtained from different years, ecological zones, genotypes, and cultivation practices indicated a high goodness of fitness between the simulated results and observed values. The root mean square error (RMSE) between simulated and observed days from sowing to emergence, emergence to squaring, anthesis to boll opening, and sowing to boll opening was 0.9, 2.2, 1.7, and 2.1 d, respectively, with a mean of 2.1 d, and in all plant sites, the RMSE between simulated and observed days from squaring to boll opening was 1.8-3.7 d, and that from squaring to opening was 4.6-5.8 d.",

The oxidized nanodiamonds (OND) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, X-ray phtoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD). PS-DVB-OND particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The result suggested that OND were successfully embedded into the polymer microspheres with the diameter of 6 ± 2 µm. Compared to polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) microspheres, PS-DVB-OND microspheres could tolerate higher pressure. The PS-DVB-OND microspheres were used as stationary phase of reversed-phase liquid chromatography directly and anion-exchangers after further quaternized with methylamine and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether. Reversed-phase liquid chromatographic performance of PS-DVB-OND beads was investigated through separating six benzenes such as toluene, benzaldehyde, phenol, benzoic acid, 1,4-hydroquinone and methyl p-hydroxybenzoate. Inorganic anions such as F, Cl, NO, Br, NO, HPO and SO, were baseline separated on the anion exchangers of PS-DVB-OND microspheres. The result suggested that the prepared PS-DVB-OND microspheres have the potential as liquid chromatographic stationary phase under high pressure and extremely pH conditions.",

By integrating the topological structure of rice root, the whole three-dimensional visualization model of rice root was established using GDD as driving factor, including the sub-models of the initial emergence time and location, initial extension angle, elongation rate and spatial distribution of adventitious root in rice. Finally, by integrating the sub-modules of visualization display, scene control, human-machine interface and database management on the platform of Visual C++, the three-dimensional visualization system of rice root was established, and the three-dimensional morphology of rice root under different growth conditions was simulated based on this system.

        "abstract": "This paper combines the analysis of rice growth data with crop modeling to quantify the changes in single rice cultivars over three decades from 1981 to 2009 at four sites in China. Crop data include timing of main developmental stages, aboveground biomass, grain yield, 1000-grain weight, grain number per spike, percentage filled grains, and plant density. The APSIM-Oryza model was used to quantify the rice cultivar changes and their impact on growth and yield. The results showed that cultivar changes could be explained by the changes in rice physiology captured in APSIM-Oryza and changes in yield components. Cultivar changes mainly involved: (1) the increase in actual thermal time requirements during the growing period as a result of reduced development rates and photoperiod sensitivity and extended grain filling period, which compensated the negative impact of warming to shorten growing period and stabilized or increased aboveground biomass and (2) the increase in grain numbers and harvest index as a result of the dwarfing and improved growth. Once these changes could be captured in the parameterization of model, APSIM-Oryza could explain 61.7% of the variation in observed aboveground biomass and 55.1% of the variation in grain yield. This demonstrates that crop modeling is an efficient means to study the impact of environmental and cultivar changes on crop productivity in the future. It also highlights the needs to quantify the physiological changes in new cultivars by combining field observations and crop modeling in future research. © 2013.",

Quaternary amine functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (q-MWNTs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used as an amperometric sensor to determine MTX and FA. The electrochemical behaviors of MTX and FA at the q-MWNTs/GCE were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Results indicated that this modified electrode exhibited electrocatalytic oxidation toward MTX and FA with high sensitivity, stability and long life. Good separation of MTX and FA was demonstrated by IC on an anion-exchange column with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as eluent. Under the optimal conditions, the linear ranges were from 0.01 to 20mg/L for both MTX and FA with correlation coefficients r ≥ 0.9994. The obtained detection limits (LODs) for MTX and FA were 0.2 and 0.4 μg/L (S/N=3), respectively. The method has been successfully applied to the determination of MTX and FA in plasma and urine of patients of rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Pinus koraiensis is one of the most important native tree species in northeastern region of China. It is important to select optimum seedling age for transplantation in a given site condition according to both seedling quality and field performance. Four kinds of seedlings, such as S2-0, S2-1, S2-2, and F2-0, were used to test differences in seedling quality in Jiangmifeng Forest Country of Jinlin. In comparison with S2-0, height, root diameter, FOLR, and dry mass of S2-1 were increased by 100%, 108.2%, 100%, 398.4%, respectively. The N, P, and K contents were improved by 368.6%, 646.2%, 349.3%, respectively. S2-0 had only 67.5% of survival rate when being outplanted in one year, while the survival rate of S2-1 was improved by 20.6%, and therefore, it is necessary to transplant S2-0 seedlings in a nursery for further culture. When 2-0 seedlings were transplanted in the nursery for another 2-year culture (S2-2), minor improvement of seedling quality was shown compared with the seedlings transplanted for another 1-year culture (S2-1). No differences in survival and increment of root diameter were found between S2-2 and S2-0. Height in F2-0 when lifted and survival when outplanted in 1 year were improved by 35.4% and 5.6% in comparison to S2-0, respectively, indicating that sowing in the fall was able to increase seedling quality. FOLR of S2-2, S2-1, S2-0 and F2-0 were 18, 14, 7 and 7, respectively. And initial FOLR was correlated significantly with the survival, total height and root diameter of the seedlings when being outplanted for 1 year. Thus, FOLR could be one of the reliable, feasible indicators to predict field performance for Pinus koraiensis.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of Long Tail in electronic markets illuminates that niche and obscure products which previously sold very little can make up a significant share of total sales. We build a circle city model with horizontal product differentiation to describe the electronic market involving niche products and a featured product. With the model, we analyze the competition between niche products and a featured product. The analytical results demonstrate that it can enhance the consumers' utilities by adopting niche products into the electronic market, and the search cost has an important impact on niche product sales.",

        "abstract": "Polymyxins are increasingly used as a last-resort class of antibiotics against extensive drug-resistant (XDR) Gram-negative bacteria. However, resistance to polymyxins can emerge with monotherapy. As nephrotoxicity is the major dose-limiting factor for polymyxin monotherapy, dose escalation to suppress the emergence of polymyxin resistance is not a viable option. Therefore, novel approaches are needed to preserve this last-line class of antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial synergy of polymyxin B combined with enrofloxacin against  Static time-kill studies were conducted over 24 h with polymyxin B (1-4 mg/L) and enrofloxacin (1-4 mg/L) alone or in combination. Additionally, a one-compartment  model (IVM) and hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) was performed against  12196. Polymyxin B and enrofloxacin in monotherapy were ineffective against all of the  isolates examined. Whereas, polymyxin B-enrofloxacin in combination was synergistic against  with ≥ 2-4 log kill at 24 h in the static time-kill studies. In both IVM and HFIM, the combination was synergistic and the bacterial counting values were below the limit of quantification on day 5 in the HFIM. A population analysis profile indicated that the combination inhibited the emergence of polymyxin resistance in  12196. The mechanism-based modeling suggests that the synergistic killing is a result of the combination of mechanistic and subpopulation synergy. Overall, this is the first preclinical study to demonstrate that the polymyxins-enrofloxacin combination is of considerable utility for the treatment of XDR  infections and warrants future clinical evaluations.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantitatively analyze the change patterns of rice root morphological characteristics based on image analysis method in pot experiments with different nitrogen rates,water regimes,and rice cultivars in different years.WinRhizo software (WR) was used as the root image analysis tool,and two modes of LM and T200 were used to measure the root diameter and adventitious root length under two ranges of root diameter as 0–0.30 mm and 0.25–1.80 mm,respectively.The measurement results from WR were compared with those from Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (IP).Then,the diameter ranges of different types of root were determined.On the basis of the dataset from WR,the statistical analysis were performed on rice root morphological characteristic indices,including dry weight,total volume,total surface area,total adventitious root length and number per plant at different growth stages.The results were as follows: (1) The average NRMSEs between WR (LM and T200) and IP for root diameters were 5.44% and 10.95%.(2) The diameter range of fine lateral root was circumscribed within 0.03–0.10 mm for all the experiments,coarse lateral and adventitious root were circumscribed within 0.10-0.30 and 0.30–1.40 mm for V1 (Nipponbare) and V2 (Wuxiangjing 14),but 0.10–0.25 and 0.25–1.65 mm for V3 (Yangdao 6).Following this method,the NRMSEs for adventitious root length measured by WR and IP were 10.78–12.01%.(3) All indices increased rapidly in the growth process and reached or approached the maximum at heading,then increased slowly or decreased after heading.There were significant differences between treatments with different nitrogen rates from tillering to maturing on all indices.Increasing nitrogen rate accelerated the growth of roots,and especially enhanced the proportion of adventitious roots.Properly control of irrigation could promote the growth of roots and increase the proportion of lateral roots.All indices of V3 were significantly higher than these of other cultivars,and there were no significant differences between V1 and V2.The results indicated that it was feasible to measure morphological indices of different types of rice root by WR with different modes,and the methods used in this paper have a good accuracy and reliability.These results could provide a support for the quantitative analysis on root morphology of rice or other crops.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the bridge vessel, radial artery is easy to occur spasm and injury of endometrium, and the abnormal proliferation of endometrium, re-vasospasm, etc. appear at early period postoperatively, which can affect the operative outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of nitroglycenn (NTG), verapamil (VP), paraverine (PA), and the mixture of NTG and VP on relaxing spasm of radial artery in human being. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Department of Cardiosurgery, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command of Chinese PLA. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with autologous radial artery, were selected from the Department of Cardiosurgery, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command of Chinese PLA from September to November in 2006, including 18 males and 12 females, 48-74 years of age. Informed consents were obtained from all the patients or their relatives preoperatively. METHODS: ① The samples of human radial artery in CABG were collected, and totally 95 vascular rings were used in this study. The rings were divided into five groups: NTG group, VP group, PA group, VP+NTG group and control group. There two parts of the experiment, vasospasm relaxation test and vasospasm prevention test. The vascular rings in the control group were only immersed in the Krebs- Ringer solution without any drug. ② Drugs: NTG was purchased from Solo Pak Laboratories (Franklin Park, IL), PA from Eli Lilly & Co., (Indianapolis, IN), VP and others from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). ③ Thirty vascular rings were used in the vasospasm relaxation test, and the method of bath chamber was applied. Deoxyepinephrine (terminal concentration of 1×10-3 mol/L) was added to stimulate the contraction and spasm of the vascular rings, then four vasodilatators were added, the concentrations of VP and NTG were 30 μmol/L, and that of PA was 0.1%. Relaxation rate=(resting tension after stimulation-initial resting tension)/initial resting tension×100%. ④ The other 60 vascular rings were used in the vasospasm prevention test. Firstly, the rings were immersed in the four solutions of vasodilatators of corresponding concentrations and Krebs- Ringer solution respectively for 30 minutes. After pretreatment, the vascular rings were randomly divided into normothermia group (n =30) and cryopreservation group (n = 30). In the cryopreservation group, the vascular rings were put into the Krebs-Ringer buffer solution at 4 ℃, and kept in refrigerator at 4 ℃ for 24 hours. The spasms of radial artery were observed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes of resting tension (degree of contraction and relaxation rate of dilatation) of vascular rings before and after administration. RESULTS: ① Effect on the dilatation of spastic radial artery: The radial artery was completely within 11 minutes in all the VP+NTG group, VP group, NTG group and PA group. But in the first 3 minutes, the dilating effects of VP+NTG and NTG were obviously better than the other two groups. The dilatation curves showed that the dilating ability in order was VP+NTG > NTG > VP > PA. ② Effect of pretreatment of radial artery on antispasm: In the normothermia group, the contractility of the vascular ring produced by 1×10-3 mol/L deoxyepinephrine was close between the VP+NTG group and VP group [(0.47±0. 06), (0.49±0.08) g, P > 0.05], which were obviously different from those in the NTG group and PA group [(0.81±0.22), (0.87±0.26 ) g, P < 0.05]. After cryopreservation for 24 hours, the contractility in the VP+NTG group was not obviously different from that in the VP group [(0.86±0.11), (0.90±0.13) g, P > 0.05], and obviously lower than those in the NTG group, PA group and control group [(4.82±0.87), (5.00±0.53), (5.10±0.67) g, P < 0.01], whereas those in the NTG group and PA group were close to that in the control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The drugs can prevent and relax the spasm of radial artery to different extents, whereas considering from preventing spasm and the time-effect of treatment, the mixture of VP and NTG seems to be more proper as the preparation solution for the treatment of radial artery in CABG.",

The crop model resource includes general model structure, modeling algorithm expression and model resource mapping. The all-around model representation method of crop model resource was proposed that combines model and/or concept tree, model and/or algorithm graphics with pattern of implementation. Based on component framework, component assembly and model compiling techniques, the principle of CMRCP was established according to adaptive software development. The platform works with crop metamodel, learning mechanism, model construction engine and support tools for modeling. The results show that constructing the CMRCP with ability of learning, adaptability and component characteristics, can advance the crop modeling knowledge resources and the crop model development resources changes, can enhance the crop model resource library for sharing and reuse. It helps to make it easy to conduct crop model construction and development, which improves the quality and efficiency of software development, and provides construction platform for crop intelligence modeling.",

The dry matter partitioning indices of green leaf, stem and pod varied with the physiological development, and were influenced by the genotype, sowing date, nitrogen level and water status. Green leaf dry matter was regulated by nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). The higher the NNI, the higher the partitioning index of green leaf was. The factor of sowing date was introduced to regulate the partitioning index of pod. A delayed sowing date often induced an increased partitioning index of pod. The validation with different data sets involving variety, sowing date, and nitrogen application rate showed that this model had a good predictability and practicability.",

Homemade resins were functionalized with controllable amounts of quaternary ammonium groups. The low-capacity anion-exchange column and high-capacity anion-exchange column were prepared, due to the resins having different exchange capacities. With this method, iodide and iodate in povidone iodine solution were detected simultaneously in a short time with iodide being eluted off first. A series of standard solutions consisting of target anions of various concentrations from 0.01 mg/L to 100 mg/L were analyzed. Each anion exhibited satisfactory linearity, with correlation coefficient r ≥ 0.9990. The detection limits (LODs) for iodide and iodate obtained by injecting 100 μL of sample were 5.66 and 14.83 μg/L (S/N=3), respectively. A spiking study was performed with satisfactory recoveries between 101.2% and 100.6% for iodide and iodate.",

        "abstract": "Polymyxins are a last-line therapy against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, resistance to polymyxins has been increasingly reported. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of polymyxin activity and resistance is crucial for preserving their clinical usefulness. This study employed comparative metabolomics and transcriptomics to investigate the responses of polymyxin-susceptible P. aeruginosa PAK (polymyxin B MIC, 1 mg/liter) and its polymyxin-resistant  mutant PAK (MIC, 16 mg/liter) to polymyxin B (4, 8, and 128 mg/liter) at 1, 4, and 24 h, respectively. Our results revealed that polymyxin B at 4 mg/liter induced different metabolic and transcriptomic responses between polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant P. aeruginosa. In strain PAK, polymyxin B significantly activated PmrAB and the mediated  operon, leading to increased 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) synthesis and the addition to lipid A. In contrast, polymyxin B did not increase lipid A modification in strain PAK. Moreover, the syntheses of lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan were significantly decreased in strain PAK but increased in strain PAK due to polymyxin B treatment. In addition, 4 mg/liter polymyxin B significantly perturbed phospholipid and fatty acid levels and induced oxidative stress in strain PAK, but not in PAK. Notably, the increased trehalose-6-phosphate levels indicate that polymyxin B potentially caused osmotic imbalance in both strains. Furthermore, 8 and 128 mg/liter polymyxin B significantly elevated lipoamino acid levels and decreased phospholipid levels but without dramatic changes in lipid A modification in wild-type and mutant strains, respectively. Overall, this systems study is the first to elucidate the complex and dynamic interactions of multiple cellular pathways associated with the polymyxin mode of action against P. aeruginosa.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been highlighted by the recent WHO Global Priority Pathogen List due to multidrug resistance. Without new antibiotics, polymyxins remain a last-line therapeutic option for this difficult-to-treat pathogen. The emergence of polymyxin resistance highlights the growing threat to our already very limited antibiotic armamentarium and the urgency to understand the exact mechanisms of polymyxin activity and resistance. Integration of the correlative metabolomics and transcriptomics results in the present study discovered that polymyxin treatment caused significant perturbations in the biosynthesis of lipids, lipopolysaccharide, and peptidoglycan, central carbon metabolism, and oxidative stress. Importantly, lipid A modifications were surprisingly rapid in response to polymyxin treatment at clinically relevant concentrations. This is the first study to reveal the dynamics of polymyxin-induced cellular responses at the systems level, which highlights that combination therapy should be considered to minimize resistance to the last-line polymyxins. The results also provide much-needed mechanistic information which potentially benefits the discovery of new-generation polymyxins.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral sensors have great potential in crop monitoring due to their high flexibility, high spatial resolution, and ease of operation. Image preprocessing, however, is a prerequisite to make full use of the acquired high-quality data in practical applications. Most crop monitoring studies have focused on specific procedures or applications, and there has been little attempt to examine the accuracy of the data preprocessing steps. This study focuses on the preprocessing process of a six-band multispectral camera (Mini-MCA6) mounted on UAVs. First, we have quantified and analyzed the components of sensor error, including noise, vignetting, and lens distortion. Next, different methods of spectral band registration and radiometric correction were evaluated. Then, an appropriate image preprocessing process was proposed. Finally, the applicability and potential for crop monitoring were assessed in terms of accuracy by measurement of the leaf area index (LAI) and the leaf biomass inversion under variable growth conditions during five critical growth stages of winter wheat. The results show that noise and vignetting could be effectively removed via use of correction coefficients in image processing. The widely used Brown model was suitable for lens distortion correction of a Mini-MCA6. Band registration based on ground control points (GCPs) (Root-Mean-Square Error, RMSE = 1.02 pixels) was superior to that using PixelWrench2 (PW2) software (RMSE = 1.82 pixels). For radiometric correction, the accuracy of the empirical linear correction (ELC) method was significantly higher than that of light intensity sensor correction (ILSC) method. The multispectral images that were processed using optimal correction methods were demonstrated to be reliable for estimating LAI and leaf biomass. This study provides a feasible and semi-automatic image preprocessing process for a UAV-based Mini-MCA6, which also serves as a reference for other array-type multispectral sensors. Moreover, the high-quality data generated in this study may stimulate increased interest in remote high-efficiency monitoring of crop growth status.",

        "abstract": "To establish a prostatic hyperplasia model with Beagle canines.Twenty-four two-year-old male Beagle canines were divided into treatment and control groups at random and were administrated testosterone propionate (TP) through intramuscular injection two months after castration. Three treatment groups were given 0.8, 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg TP respectively, and the control was given the same volume of vehicle. Two months later, half of the animals were killed and the serum and prostate were prepared. After the wet weight and volume of prostate were measured, the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level of serum and prostate were detected with DHT radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit, and paraffine section from canine prostate was stained by the HE methods. Pictures were taken by digital camera under microscope, and all the pictures were analyzed by computer for epithelial cell height and acinar luminal area of prostate with micro image analysis software. The canine prostate volume was measured with ultrasonic diagnosis instrument before castration, at two months after castration and at two months after being given TP.The ultrasonic results showed that the prostate volumes of all the canines were smaller at two months after castration than before castration (P < 0.05), and after having been administrated TP for two months, and the prostate volumes of all treatment groups were larger than those of the control group (P < 0.01). The wet weight of the prostate of the treatment group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05), and both had dose-dependent relationship. The DHT level of serum and prostate of the canines became higher with the increase of TP dose. The results of micro image analysis showed that the acinar luminal area of prostate was enlarged, and the epithelial cell height increased with larger dose of TP.It is practicable to establish prostatic hyperplasia model in Beagle canines after two months of TP administration.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, disorder engineering of catalytic materials has attracted significant attention because it can increase catalytic active sites and thus enhance their catalytic activity for electrocatalytic reactions. However, it is extremely important to uncover the relationship between disorder engineering and catalytic activity. Particularly, deep exploration of the relationship is very important for fabricating excellent highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is one of the promising technologies in energy transition. In this study, we prepared Fe-doped Ni3S2 materials and simultaneously controlled the disorder degree by regulating the ion concentration to improve the activity for OER. By investigating the as-prepared catalysts with various disorder degrees for OER, we also explored the relationship between the disordered structure and OER catalytic performance. In particular, the optimized electrocatalyst with an appropriate disorder degree showed excellent activity and stability. We hope that this study provides a feasible direction to fabricate and optimize transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) electrocatalysts as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for OER.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY Compared with the well-studied biochemical function of NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN1 (NAP1) as a histone chaperone in nucleosome assembly/disassembly, the physiological roles of NAP1 remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we define the NAP1 gene family members in Arabidopsis, examine their molecular properties, and use reverse genetics to characterize their biological roles. We show that the four AtNAP1-group proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers, can bind histone H2A, and are localized abundantly in the cytoplasm and weakly in the nucleus at steady state. AtNAP1;4 differs from the others by showing inhibitor- sensitive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and tissue-specific expression, restricted to root segments and pollen grains. The other three AtNAP1 genes are ubiquitously expressed in plants and the AtNAP1;3 protein is detected as the major isoform in seedlings. We show that disruption of the AtNAP1-group genes does not affect normal plant growth under our laboratory conditions. Interestingly, two allelic triple mutants, Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-1 and Atnap1;1-1 Atnap1;2-1 Atnap1;3-2, exhibit perturbed genome tran- scription, and show hypersensitivity to DNA damage caused by UV-C irradiation. We show that AtNAP1;3 binds chromatin, with enrichment at some genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, and that the expression of these genes is downregulated in the triple mutants. Taken together, our results highlight conserved and isoform-specific properties of AtNAP1 proteins, and unravel their function in the NER pathway of DNA damage repair.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel ion exchange stationary phase based on different generations of poly (amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) was developed for the determination of inorganic anions and carbohydrates. Synthesis of the PAMAM was carried out with the polymerization reaction of ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate. The synthesized PAMAM was then grafted to the polystyrene-divinylbenzene-glycidyl methacrylate (PS-GMA) to form PAMAM-based beads. These beads were finally modified with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) to generate the anion exchanger, which were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), brunauer-emmett-teller (BET), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and elemental analysis. Elemental analysis, breakthrough curves and capacity factors showed that more epoxy groups and higher PAMAM generations in stationary phase could result in higher anion exchange capacity. The efficiency, durability and stability of the proposed anion exchanger were investigated by using six inorganic anions (fluoride, chloride, nitrite, bromide, nitrate and sulfate) and four carbohydrates (trehalose, glucose, maltotriose and galacturonic acid) as analytes, respectively. The reliability of the proposed ion chromatographic stationary phase was demonstrated by determining the content of galacturonic acid in polysaccharides from Poria cocos and Atractylodes macrocephala. The relative standard deviations of retention time, peak height, and peak area for galacturonic acid were 0.39%, 1.22%, and 2.02%, respectively. The spiked recoveries were in the range of 88.29%-100.51% for plant polysaccharides. Due to the good structural homogeneity, intense internal porosity, biological compatibility and high density of active groups in PAMAM, this grafted stationary phase showed good ion-exchange characteristics, especially in biological charged molecules.

        "abstract": "AIM: To make clear the relationship between testosterone propionate (TP) and the growth of prostatic epithelial cell in castration beagle canine. METHODS: The prostates were extracted from the castrated beagle canine which have been treated with TP. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in prostate was detected by radioimmunoassay(RIA), the slices of prostate (4 μm) were stained with H & E investigated under microscope, and the acinar luminal area and the height of epithelial cell were measured with videodensitometer. The expression of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) of epithelial cell was determined by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: DHT level of prostate was increased in TP treated groups. Under microscope, the acinar luminal area of prostate was enlarged and the height of epithelial cell was increased in TP treated groups. The microimage analysis showed that the acinar luminal area of prostate in TP treated groups enlarged significantly (P < 0.01), the area was 4.5-7 times of that of control; the height of epithelial cell also was 4-8 times of that of control (P < 0.01). In TP treated groups, the expression of PSA and the expression of PAP of epithelial cell were higher than that of control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The growth and functions of epithelial cell of prostate from castrated canine were depended on androgen, and the epithelial cell would be atrophied if it was deprived of androgen.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To explore the effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine \"Caulis Sargentodoxae Drug Granules\"(CSD) on the differential expression gene of extracellular matrix,adhesive molecule and VEGFmRNA in rat ectopic endometrium by CSD.Methods:The model of endometriosis was established by Autotransplantion,the animals were randomly divided into 6 groups:model control group(group A),ovariectomized group(group B),mifepristone group(5 mg/kg,group C),CSD low dose group(20 g/kg,group D),medium dose group(40 g/kg,group E) and high dose group(80 g/kg,group F).After consecutive treatment for 21 d,the extracellular matrix(ECM) and adhesive molecule expression were detected by gene array,and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) mRNA in ectopic endometrium for each group was detected by Realtime PCR.Results:1)Gene array results showed there were 27 differentially expressed genes,7 down-regulated genes and 20 up-regulated genes between model rats and normal rats,which could be divided into three main categories:adhesion molecules,extracellular matrix proteins,protease and protease inhibitors.CSD high dose group(Group F) could improve the differential gene expression in endometriosis rats,and could reduce the expression of cell adhesion molecules.It could also reduce the expression of proteases,and tend to normalize those expressions. 2)The expression level of VEGF mRNA in ectopic endometrium in group B,C,E or F was significantly lower than that in group A(P<0.01).Conclusion:CSD may hold-back the genetic expression of ECM and adhesive molecule, and inhibit the expression of VEGF in ectopic endometrium.CSD then make interference in the ectopic endometrium's adhesion,invasion and angiogenesis.Finally it can inhibit the ectopic endometrium growth and induce the atrophy of explants in the endometriosis model rats.",

First, allyl glycidyl ether-styrene (AGE-ST) copolymer latex was prepared by the saponification emulsion polymerization method. It was then quaternized by reacting alternatively with methylamine (MA) and 1,4-butanedioldiglycidyl ether (BDDGE) and agglomerated on the surface of sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) microspheres to obtain a copolymer latex-agglomerated anion exchange chromatography stationary phase. The stationary phase was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FT-IR and elemental analysis (EA). It was found that the diameters of the PS-DVB microsphere and AGE-ST copolymer latex were about 6 μm and 300 nm, respectively. The quaternized AGE-ST copolymer latex was successfully agglomerated on the surface of PS-DVB microspheres and the nitrogen content increased as quaternization time was increased. The chromatographic properties were evaluated by separating conventional anions and organic acids. The results showed that the quaternized AGE-ST copolymer latex-agglomerated PS-DVB anion exchange column exhibited good separation properties toward anions. Therefore, based on the good pH toleration and reaction activity of the newly developed stationary phase, it was concluded that using AGE as a monomer was a good choice.",

        "abstract": "A novel double layer pipette tip magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction (DPT-MSPE) based on polyamidoamine-functionalized magnetic carbon nanotubes (PAMAM@Mag-CNTs) was developed for the purification of fifteen toxic alkaloids in meat dishes and vegetable dishes. PAMAM@Mag-CNTs were synthesized through direct reaction between the carboxy group on the surface of the Mag-CNTs and the peripheral amino group of the polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. The magnetism of PAMAM@Mag-CNTs simplified the post-processing during preparation of the sorbent, and reinforced the interaction between the sorbents and the analytes during the cleanup procedure. An ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) coupled with DPT-MSPE method has been developed to determine fifteen alkaloids in meat dishes and vegetable dishes. Under the optimal conditions, satisfactory recoveries, i.e., 83.4–125% for meat dishes and 84.2–122% for vegetable dishes, were obtained due to the high cleanup efficiency of the DPT-MSPE. Furthermore, the method, which displays good linearity (r ≥ 0.9991), acceptable precision (RSD u003c 8%), and low limits of quantification (0.054–1.058 ng g−1), has been successfully applied to several food samples, and it was confirmed that PAMAM@Mag-CNTs DPT-MSPE was a highly effective extraction method for alkaloids in cooked food samples.",

A self-packed pretreatment column (50 × 4.6 mm, i.d.) was used for the extraction and clean-up of betaine, l-carnitine and choline. The separation was achieved using self-packed cationic exchange column (150 × 4.6 mm, i.d.), followed by nonsuppressed conductivity detection. Under optimized experimental conditions, the developed method presented good analytical performance, with excellent linearity in the range of 0.60-100 μg mL for betaine, 0.75-100 μg mL for l-carnitine and 0.50-100 μg mL for choline, with all correlation coefficients (R ) >0.99 in urine. The limits of detection were 0.15 μg mL for betaine, 0.20 μg mL for l-carnitine and 0.09 μg mL for choline. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision for all quality controls were within ±10.32 and ±9.05%, respectively. Satisfactory recovery was observed between 92.8 and 102.0%. The validated method was successfully applied to the detection of urinary samples from 10 healthy people. The values detected in human urine using the proposed method showed good agreement with the measurement reported previously.",

        "abstract": "Plant-based analytical techniques of nitrogen (N) nutrition, established on the concept of critical nitrogen (Nc), can be used to diagnose the in-season N status of rice, which in turns can provide understanding of N nutrition and serve as a guide for the profitability and sustainability of agricultural production system. The objectives of present study were to develop an appropriate Nc curve for Japonica rice, to compare this curve with existing Nc dilution curve for Indica rice and to assess its plausibility to estimate the level of N nutrition for rice crop in east China. Three field experiments were conducted with varied N rates (0-360kgNha-1) in three Japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) hybrids, Lingxiangyou-18 (LXY-18), Wuxiangjing-14 (WXJ-14) and Wuyunjing (WYJ) in Jiangsu province of east China. Five hills from each plot were sampled from active tillering to heading for growth analysis. The Nc dilution curve for rice, based on whole-plant N concentration, was described by the equation (Nc=3.53W-0.28), when aboveground biomass ranged from 1.55 to 12.37tha-1. However, for above-ground biomass <1.55tha-1, the constant critical value Nc=3.05% DM was applied, which was independent of aboveground biomass. Our Nc dilution curve was lower than the existing curve of Indica rice in tropics. The N nutrition index (NNI) and accumulated N deficit (Nand) ranged from 0.58 to 1.06 and 127 to -12kgha-1, respectively, during main development stages under different N treatments in 2010 and 2011. Different N fertilizations were suggested for unit NNI increase or unit Nand decrease at different stages. LXY-18 have more N assimilation tendency than WXJ-14 for satisfying rice growth for same dry matter. The Nc dilution curve, resulting NNI and Nand, adequately identified situations of limiting and non-limiting N nutrition and could be used as a reliable indicator of N stress during the growing season of Japonica rice in east China. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Monitoring canopy leaf pigment density in wheat with hyperspectral remote sensing",
        "abstract": "Canopy leaf pigment status is a key index for evaluating crop potential photosynthetic efficiency and nutritional stress. Leaf pigment density per unit ground area provides a rapid and non-destructive method to evaluate yield predictions and management of nitrogen applications. This study investigated the quantitative relationships of leaf pigment density to canopy hyperspectral reflectance in wheat (Tritium aestivum L.) with two field experiments consisting of different cultivars and nitrogen levels in two growing seasons. On the basis of measured protein content, the cultivars, Yumai 34, Yangmai 12 and Ningmai 9 were considered as high, medium and low protein types, respectively. Four nitrogen rates were applied as 0, 75, 150, 225 kg N hm -2 in the form of urea in 2004-2005, and 0, 90, 180, 270 kg N hm -2 in the form of urea in 2005-2006. Canopy hyperspectral reflectance over 350-2500 ran was measured, and the density of chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), chlorophyll a + b (Chl a + b), and carotenoid (Car) were determined for leaves in the wheat canopies. The densities of the different pigments (Chl a, Chl b, Chl a + b, Car) in wheat leaves increased with increasing nitrogen application rates. With respect to plant development, the densities of the different pigments (Chl a, Chl b, Chl a + b, Car) initially increased and then decreased after jointing with differences between the cultivars, while gradually decreasing in the non-nitrogen treatment. The sensitive wavebands for pigment density occurred mostly within the visible light range, and a close correlation existed between the first derivatives of reflectance in the red-edge region (680-760 nm) and leaf pigment density. The analyses between 21 vegetation indices and leaf pigment density indicated that the pigment densities were highly correlated to all these 21 vegetation indices. The correlations of leaf chlorophyll density to the following five vegetation indices, were higher than for the other spectral parameters, with the coefficients of determination (R 2) for linear correlations above 0.858. These five vegetation indices were Vogelmann indices 2 (Vog2), Vogelmann indices 3 (Vog3), the ratio vegetation index of 810 to 560 nm (RVI(810,560)), the ratio of the red-edge (680-760 nm) slope to the blue-edge (490-530 nm) slope (SRE/SBE), and the ratio of the integral of the first derivative on the red-edge region to that on the blue-edge region (SDr/SDb). All the values of R 2 between Car density and the different spectral indices were below 0.780. Testing of the derived regression equations with independent datasets indicated that Vog2, Vog3, SRE/SBE and SDr/SDb were the best to predict leaf pigment density with a relative error (RE, (simulated value - observed value)/observed value) below 17.6%. The R 2 associated with the Chl b density was below 0.804, lower than that of other pigment densities. The overall results suggested that the Vog2, Vog3, SRE/SBE and SDr/SDb indices have stable relationships with the pigment density in wheat leaves, especially the densities of leaf Chl a and Chl a + b.",

        "abstract": "Nitrogen/carbon layer coordinated transition metal complexes are the most important alternatives to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts for energy storage and conversion systems, which require systematic investigation and improvement. The coordination mode of transition metal ions can directly affect the catalytic performance of catalysts. Herein, this paper reports that two kinds of Cu-based composites (CuSCN and CuSCN/C3N4) are prepared by in situ controllable crystallization of copper foam (CF) through electropolymerization and calcination. As a comparison, it is clarified that the different coordination modes of Cu1+ ions determine the different catalytic properties. The samples can be switched freely by tuning the electropolymerization period, which leads to different coordination modes of Cu1+ ions dramatically, thus affecting the electrocatalytic performance of composite materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in turn. Thorough characterization using techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron-based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, reveals that strong interactions between CuSCN and C3N4 of CuSCN/C3N4 facilitate the formation of subtle coordinated N-Cu-S species, of which electronic structures are changed. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electrons can penetrate from CuSCN to N atoms present in C3N4. As a result, CuSCN/C3N4 demonstrates a better catalytic performance than the conventional transition-metal-based electrocatalysts. Besides, CuSCN/C3N4 reflects almost identical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability in an acid electrolyte with Pt/C.",

        "abstract": "【Objective】 Fast and accurate estimation of crop growth model parameters is the basis of the crop system simulation.【Method】In this paper,a newly improved genetic algorithm,named individual advantage genetic algorithm(IAGA),is proposed and applied to the field of the parameters evaluation of the rice development stages model.Firstly,the individual advantage operator was introduced into the genetic algorithm,thus improved the mutation operator and the update strategy of population.Secondly,two rice development stages models,RiceGrow and ORYZA2000,were coupled with IAGA in a way of total embedment,and realized automatic estimation of the parameters in the models.At last,a series of comparative experiments were carried out to verify the effectiveness of IAGA with multi-year field trial data of Shanyou63,and other four rice varieties in Xuzhou,Gaoyao,etc.【Result】The experimental verification results which cover RMSE<3.05 d,NRMSE<3.19%,MDA<2.41 d,R2>0.9877,indicated that the accuracy of the model parameters obtained by IAGA was pretty high.The amount of data used for the parameters estimation had little effect on the results.The maximum NRMSE of the fitting results increased from 2.58% to 3.08% when the amount of data used for the parameters estimation from three years to six years was changed.More accurate model parameters were obtained when we select the data of every other year,including the maximum and minimum value of the whole growth period.Compared with the shuffled complex evolution algorithm,genetic simulated annealing algorithm and standard particle swarm algorithm,IAGA could obtain more accurate model parameters【.Conclusion】The IAGA can achieve automatic determination of rice development stages model parameters,therefore it provides an effective and new method for estimating parameters for crop growth model quickly and accurately.",

Rats in the naoyikang group received gastric perfusion of naoyikang at 1.5 times of equivalent dose for 10 continuous days, serum after taking naoyikang was collected one hour after the last gastric perfusion. Serum in the control group after gastric perfusion of normal saline of the same volume was collected as control. ② Seven days after induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) of PC12 cell, it was flushed twice with DMEM basic medium, which was added 100, 300 and 500 g/L serum of naoyikang respectively, incubated at 37 ℃ for one hour, then incubated by added 0.2 mmol/L Glu and 0.5 mmol/L hydroperoxide for another 30 mins. Meanwhile, model group (PC12 cell injury model induced by Glu and hydroperoxide without adding Glu and hydroperoxide) and naoyikang group (rat's serum without added Glu and hydroperoxide) were set up.③Survival rate of PC12 were assayed with MTT colorimetry; Releasing rate of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were assayed according to the instruction on the test kit.④Differences of measurement data were compared with ANOVA method. RESULTS: ①Survival rates of PC12 cell in the Glu group and hydroperoxide group were significantly lower than that in the control group(P < 0.05,0.01); While releasing rate of LDH were obviously higher than that in the control group(P < 0.01);The content of MDA of PC12 cell in the Glu group and hydroperoxide group was obviously higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01); While SOD activity was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01).②Survival rate of PC12 cell in the naoyikang group was obviously higher than that in the Glu model group and hydroperoxide model group (P < 0.05-0.01); While the releasing rate of LDH was significantly lower than that in the Glu model group and hydroperoxide model group (P< 0.05-0.01).③Content of MDA in the naoyikang group was significantly lower than that in the Glu model group and hydroperoxide model group(P < 0.05,0.01); While SOD activity was significantly higher than that in the Glu model group and hydroperoxide model group(P < 0.05,0.01=.CONCLUSION: Naoyikang serum can ameliorate the PC12 cell injury induced by Glu and hydroperoxide, its mechanism may relate with the decreasing of generation membrane lipid peroxide and the increasing of activity of antioxidant enzyme.",

        "abstract": "AIM: The objective of this investigation was to research the proliferation mechanism of vas deferens in benign prostatic hyperplasia. METHODS: The vas deferens, from beagle dogs which have been administered testosterone propionate(TP) to build benign prostatic hyperplasia model in vivo, was analyzed by a series of methods. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in vas deferens was detected by radioimmunoassay, the slices (4 μm) of vas deferens were stained with HE, and the duct area as well as the height of epithelial cell were measured with videodensitometer. The apoptosis rate was determined by flow cytometry method. The expression of prostatic specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), Bcl-2 and P53 were determined by immunohistochemical methods. The nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: DHT level of vas deferens was increased with increasing TP doses, but there was no significant difference between groups. After being administered TP, the duct area of vas deferens was enlarged (P <0.01), and the height of epithelial cell was increased (P<0.01). The cell apoptosis rate of control was higher than that of 0.8 and 7.5 mg-·kg-1 TP groups (P <0.01). While there were no differences in expression of PSA, PAP and Bcl-2 between control and other groups, the expression of P53 of control was higher than that of the other groups (P <0.05). In agarose gel electrophoresis, the 200 bp base pair DNA fragments and the multiples of them were observed in control, while similar phenomenon didn't find in other groups. CONCLUSION: DHT induces vas deferens to proliferate, and the proliferation of vas deferens is related to inhibition of apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Non-penetrating trabecular surgery (NPTS) is a new filtrating surgery without opening in ternal trabecular structures. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the effect of NPTS with mitomycin C (MMC) and amniotic membrane (AM) implantation in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and assess the validity of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in postoperative follow-up of NPTS. Methods: NPTS with MMC and AM implantation was performed on 30 eyes of 21 patients with POAG aged 28-51 years. Intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity and the filtrating bleb appearance were recorded. UBM of the sclerectomy site was performed 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after surgery. Some parameters including conjunctival filtrating bleb appearance, condition of suprascleral aqueous lake, the thickness of residual trabeculocorneal membrane and condition of amniotic membrane were assessed. Results: IOP of postoperation (15.7 ± 3.7) mmHg was significantly lower than that of preoperation (37.3 ± 5.9) mmHg in all patients (t = 4.82, P < 0.01 ). At the end of follow-up, IOP was controlled effectively in all patients. There was no significant difference in visual acuity between preoperation and 1 month postoperation (χ2 = 8.814, P = 0.266). The functional filtrating bleb was existed in 14 eyes (46.67%) during the follow-up. The margin of anterior aqueous lakes was rough gradually. In 1-18 months after operation, the volume of anterior aqueous lakes was changed significantly and contracted gradually in comparison with preoperation (F = 38.885, P = 0.000 ). Amniotic membrane implant was not degradated until 9 months in postoperation and the transparent liquid space was not found under the scleral flap. The residual trabeculocorneal membrane was roughened eccentricly. Conclusion: NPTS with MMC and AM implant can effectively reduce IOP in patients with POAG in long-term. UBM is a new noninvasive method for postoperative observation of NPTS. AM has not the anti-fibrotic properties and facilitate aqueous outflow through the subconjunctival space.",

Therefore, regarding the need, we herein report a rapid, sensitive, and selective switchable hydrophilicity dispersive solvent-based liquid-liquid microextraction (SHDS-LLME) method combined with high-performance liquid chromatography and UV detector for determining amphenicols in food products. In the off-line extraction procedure, the mixture of extraction solvent (butanol) and dispersive solvent (tetraethylenepentamine) was manually injected into the acidic aqueous sample solution. Specifically, after the fast neutralization reaction, the dispersive solvent was converted into water-soluble salt and phase separation was achieved. Under the optimal conditions, a good linearity was observed in the range of 0.27–50.0 μg kg−1. The limit of detection for chloramphenicol (CAP) and thiamphenicol (TAP) were 0.03 and 0.08 μg kg−1, respectively. Recoveries for the spiked samples obtained were between 81.5 and 113.5% and the relative standard deviation was less than 8.6%. The proposed method was successfully applied for the analysis of amphenicols in four food products.",

Consequently, the diagnoses are often delayed. In this work we studied the clinicopathologic characteristics of the POEMS syndrome to improve early diagnosis to prevent irreversible damage.We conducted a clinicopathologic analysis of 9 cases of POEMS and made a differential diagnosis with related diseases.The patients with POEMS syndrome were shown to have complicated clinical characteristics, including peripheral neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma proliferative disorder, skin changes, extravascular volume overload, sclerotic bone lesions, thrombocytosis, and Castleman disease. POEMS syndrome shared many elements with other diseases and the key way to differentiate them was to determine whether there were other fundamental POEMS syndrome symptoms or signs. The level of M-protein in serum and plasma cells in bone marrow of POEMS patients was lower than that of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Sclerotic bone lesions were a distinctive feature in patients with POEMS, compared with in those with MM.Some unique clinicopathologic characteristics of POEMS syndrome can be used for differential diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Three field experiments were conducted with different nitrogen application rates and wheat cultivars across three growing seasons, and time-course measurements were taken on canopy spectral reflectance, leaf dry weight and leaf nitrogen concentration under the various treatments. The primary objective of this study was to explore the optimum red edge characteristics parameters and quantitative models for estimating leaf nitrogen accumulation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that the first derivative of the reflectance spectra changes regularly with increasing N rates in red edge region, and canopy spectral reflectance changes complexly. The analyses on relationships between the vegetable indices reported to leaf N accumulation indicated that red edge spectral parameters related most significantly to leaf N accumulation, differed among red edge spectral parameters. An integrated linear regression equation of leaf N accumulation to GM2, SR705 and FD742 described the dynamic pattern of change in leaf N accumulation in wheat, giving the determination of coefficients (R 2) as 0.854, 0.848 and 0.873, respectively, and the standard errors (SE) as 1.136, 1.160 and 1.059, respectively. The two peak spectral parameters in red edge region were constructed on analysis of red edge characteristics, and differential vegetation index of two peak in red edge region LSDr_REP LE was highly correlated with leaf N accumulation with 0.868 of R 2 and 1.080 of SE. When independent data were fit to the derived equations, the average relative error (RE) values as 17.6%, 17.0%, 14.9% and 14.5% between measured and estimated N accumulation using spectral parameters GM2, SR705, FD742 and LSDr_REP LE, respectively, indicating a good fit and better in LSDr_REPLE. The result indicated that those models could be used to reliably estimate the leaf N states in wheat, and especially LSDr_REP LE of new extracted parameters could indicate further steadily dynamic changes in leaf N accumulation.",

        "abstract": "A polymer-based neutral monolithic capillary column was prepared by radical polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate and ethylene dimethacrylate in a 100 mum id fused-silica capillary, and the prepared monolithic column was subsequently modified based on a ring opening reaction of epoxide groups with 1 M lysine in solution (pH 8.0) at 75 degrees C for 10 h to produce a lysine chemically bonded stationary phases in capillary column. The ring opening reaction conditions were optimized so that the column could generate substantial EOF. Due to the zwitterionic functional groups of the lysine covalently bonded on the polymer monolithic rod, the prepared column can generate cathodic and anodic EOF by varying the pH values of running buffer during CEC separation. EOF reached the maximum of -2.0 x 10(-8) m2v(-1)s(-1) and 2.6 x 10(-8) m2v(-1)s(-1) with pH of the running buffer of 2.25 and 10, respectively. As a consequence, neutral compounds, ionic solutes such as phenols, aromatic acids, anilines, and basic pharmaceuticals were all successfully separated on the column by CEC. Hydrophobic interaction is responsible for separation of neutral analytes. In addition, the electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction and the electrophoretic migration play a significant role in separation of the ionic or ionizable analytes.",

        "abstract": "China is one of the most important rice production countries in the world, and maintaining high rice productivity in China is very important for world food security. While previous studies showed that rice production in China has been and will be negatively impacted by global warming, the confounding effects of climatic change, variety improvement and agronomic managements have not been separately investigated. In this paper we combine an analysis of climate and rice growth data with crop modeling to investigate the impact of changes in climate, rice varieties, and agronomic management on rice productivity at four sites (Wuchang, Xinyang, Zhenjiang and Hanyuan) in China. The results showed a significant increase in minimum temperature during all rice growth stages at Wuchang and Zhenjiang, and from heading to maturity at Xinyang, but little change at Hanyuan. Global warming would have led to a reduction in the length of rice growing period and a reduction in grain yield at all study sites, if no varietal changes had occurred. However, the adoption of new rice varieties stabilized growing duration, increased harvest index and grain yield at three of the four sites. In the face of future warming, a planned breeding effort may be needed to offset the negative impact of future climate change. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Crop nitrogen status is a key indicator for evaluating crop growth, increasing yield and improving grain quality. Non-destructive and rapid assessment of leaf nitrogen is required for improving nitrogen management in wheat production. This study aims at identification of the quantitative relationship between leaf nitrogen accumulation and canopy reflectance spectra in winter wheat (Triticum, aestivum L.) using three field experiments with different wheat varieties and nitrogen levels. Results showed that leaf nitrogen accumulation in wheat increased with increasing nitrogen rates. Canopy reflectance changed with increasing leaf nitrogen accumulation. Sensitivity bands occurred mainly during visible light and near infrared, and strong correlation existed between red light and leaf nitrogen accumulation. The relationships of eight vegetation indicators and leaf nitrogen accumulation were analyzed using statistical models. Hyper-spectral variables were significantly correlated with leaf nitrogen accumulation, and the relationships of leaf nitrogen accumulation to SDr/SDb, FD742 and AVHRR-GVI were all highly significant with determination of coefficients (R2) as 0.9163, 0.9097 and 0.9142, respectively, and standard errors (SE) as 1.165, 1.079 and 1.077, respectively. Tests with another independent dataset showed that FD742 and REPIG could well predict leaf nitrogen accumulation in wheat with an R2 of 0.8449 and 0.8394, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.984 and 1.014, respectively. This suggests that FD742 and REPIG can be used to estimate leaf nitrogen accumulation, of which FD742 performed best in modeling and testing.",

This system aims in facilitating simulation and application of crop models for different purposes. Individual models each include six submodels for simulating phasic development, organ formation, biomass production, yield and quality formation, soil-crop water relations, and nutrient (N, P, K) balance. The implemented system can be used for evaluating individual and comprehensive management strategies based on the results of crop growth simulation under various environments and different genotypes. A Stand-alone version (GMDSSCMA) was established under the platforms VC++ and VB by adopting the characteristics of object-oriented and component-based software and with the effective integration and coupling of the growth-prediction and decision-making functions. A web-based system (GMDSSCMW) was further developed on a .net platform using C# language. These GMDSSCM systems have been used to predict dynamically crop growth and to make decisions regarding to management systems.

        "abstract": "Aims Quantitative study of root growth pattern in rice(Oryza sativa) is of great significance for guiding man-agement regulation and genetic improvement.Our objective was to elucidate the characteristics of root growth and distribution in rice under different conditions of cultivation.Methods We conducted pot experiments involving different nitrogen rates,water regimes and rice cultivars with the root shelf method.Root indices were measured at the jointing and heading stages,including total dry weight(TRW),adventitious root number(ARN),and morphological indices(length,surface area and volume) of three types of roots(adventitious,fine and coarse lateral roots).Important findings The observed root indices increased from the jointing stage to the heading stage in all treat-ments.There were significant differences in root indices among the three nitrogen rates,and each index increased with increasing nitrogen rates at both stages.In the water regime experiment,there was no significant difference in ARN between irrigation(W2) and constant water(W1),but the other indices of W2 were highest at both stages.There were no significant differences in TRW and morphological indices of coarse lateral roots between W1 and dry cultivation(W3) at the jointing stage.The other indices at the jointing stage and all indices at the heading stage were lowest with W3.All indices were significantly highest in the 'Yangdao 6'(V3) cultivar,but similar in 'Nipponbare'(V1) and 'Wuxiangjing 14'(V2) cultivars.In addition,the roots extended more deeply into soil from the jointing to the heading stage,but were mainly distributed in the top 5 cm.Lower nitrogen and water supply would promote spreading of roots in the subsoil(<5 cm) and enhance the proportions of fine and coarse lateral roots.As compared with V3,the roots of V1 and V2 extended more deeply into soil.We concluded that proper nitrogen fertilization and water control could optimize the growth and distribution characteristics of different types of rice roots and this could be influenced by the specific cultivar.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to quantify the relationship between plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) and canopy spectral reflectance at early growth stages in rice, and provide a technical support for decision making on nitrogen dressing management. Based on seven field experiments with different rice cultivars and nitrogen rates in five different growing seasons, the canopy spectral reflectance during the stages of tillering and elongation were measured with three different canopy spectral sensors (Fieldspec FR 2500, MSR-16 and GreenSeeker RT 100), and the plants were sampled for PNA measurement simultaneously. Then the relationships beween PNA and vegetation indices were analyzed. The results showed that some vegetation indices were closely related to PNA, but there were significant differences among the estimation models based on different canopy sensors. For the hyperspectral sensor (Fieldspec FR 2500), DVI(760, 740) had a good performance on model development, with determination coefficient (R 2) of 0.79, but the performance of model testing was poor, with R 2 and RMSE of 0.15 and 2.11 g/m 2, respectively. For the multispectral sensor (MSR-16), DVI(760, 710) could be used for PNA estimation, with R 2 of 0.94 for model development, and with R 2 and RMSE of 0.94 and 0.76 g/m 2 for model testing, respectively. NDVI(770, 660) from the active spectral sensor (RT 100) gave the best estimation of PNA, with R 2 of 0.97 for model development, and with R 2 and RMSE of 0.97 and 0.62 g/m 2 for model testing, respectively. These results would be helpful for selection of proper spectral sensors in PNA monitoring during early growth stages of rice.",

        "abstract": "Allergenic disperse dyes are a group of environmental contaminants, which are toxic and mutagenic to human beings. In this work, a method of dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) using graphene-coated polystyrene-divinylbenzene (G@PS-DVB) microspheres coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was proposed for the rapid determination of 10 allergenic disperse dyes in industrial wastewater samples. G@PS-DVB microspheres were synthesized by coating graphene (G) sheets onto polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) polymers. Such novel sorbents were employed in d-SPE for the purification and concentration of allergenic disperse dyes in wastewater samples prior to the determination by SFC with UV detection. To achieve the maximum extraction efficiency for the target dyes, several parameters influencing d-SPE process such as sorbent dosage, extraction time, desorption conditions were investigated. SFC conditions including stationary phase, modifier composition and percentage, column temperature, backpressure and flow rate were optimized to well separate the allergenic disperse dyes. Under the optimum conditions, satisfactory linear relationship (R ≥ 0.9989) was observed with the concentration of dyes ranging from 0.02 to 10.0 μg/mL. The limits of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the ten dyes were in the range of 1.1-15.6 ng/mL. Recoveries for the spiked samples were between 89.1% and 99.7% with relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 10.5% in all cases. The proposed method is time-saving, green, precise and repeatable for the analysis of the target dyes. Furthermore, the application of G@PS-DVB based d-SPE process can be potentially expanded to isolate and concentrate other aromatic compounds in various matrices and supercritical fluid chromatography methodology featuring rapidity, accuracy and green will be an ideal candidate for the analysis of these compounds.",

Firstly, the characteristics of agricultural models was analyzed, the mapping relationships between agricultural models and model components were established, and then information on the facets and relationship descriptions of agricultural model components was extracted and the Description Model for Agricultural Model Components (DM-AMC) was constructed. Further, the DM-AMC was represented as topic type, association type, occurrence type and association role. Finally, the Topic Maps for Agricultural Model Components (TM-AMC) was constructed by taking example and using matching and merging algorithms. With crop phasic development model as example, the XML documents of atomic topic maps with the characters of unified description and dynamic expansion were generated. The results indicated that a unified description on agricultural model information and generation of multi-level and easy-accessed TM-AMC based on DM-AMC could enhance capability of general sharing and management with agricultural model information.",

We present novel polymeric anion exchangers covalently grafted with linear quaternary ammonium polyelectrolytes via simple one-step epoxy-amine polymerization. In separation of various anionic analytes, the newly developed anion exchangers showed high efficiency (e.g., >30,000 plates m for chloride with hydroxide elution) and peculiar chromatographic behavior as compared to previously reported hyperbranched phases. By adopting different amines as the building unite of linear polyelectrolytes, the two types of model anion exchangers displayed segregated selectivity which in our opinion is associated with charge density, hydrophilicity and low cross-linking of the functionalities.",

        "abstract": "Visual simulation on crop architecture can help to better understand crop growth processes and analyze the relationship between architecture and function.Panicle of rice is the critical organ for yield formation.Its architecture depends deeply on ecological environment and cultivation methods,and most crop growth models on rice can simulate the effects of ecological environment and cultivation methods on yield components,such as panicle number,grain number per panicle,seed-setting percentage,1000-grain weight,and number of primary branch.Therefore,combination with the outputs of crop growth model,developing architecture model will improve its applicability.On the field experiments with different cultivars and nitrogen applications,we analyzed the quantitative characteristics of panicle architecture in rice.The results were as follows:The ratio of primary branch to panicle in length could be characterized by a quadratic equation expressed in terms of nodal number of branch on panicle axis;these was a linear relationship between the number of secondary branch and the length of primary branch;the primary branch grew uniformly on panicle axis and the nodal distances of primary and secondary branch also had no significant difference.Furthermore,based on the stability of spikelet number of primary branch and secondary branch,the outputs of growth model,such as grain number per panicle and the number of primary branch,were used to analyze total number of secondary branch per panicle and its space distribution.Thus panicle architecture could be described clearly.Then the model of total number of secondary branch per panicle and panicle architecture were validated with independent data.The results indicate that the simulated values of total number of secondary branch per panicle are accordant with the observed values,and the simulated panicle architectures are similar with the observed.Panicle architecture can be simulated visually under different conditions.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of acupoint injection of oxymatrine (OM) on experimental hepatocellular carcinoma and the mechanism. Methods The rats of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by 2-acetoaminoflurence (2-AAF) were randomly divided into a normal control group (group N), a model group (group M), a control group of oxymatrine intraperitoneal injection (OM ip group) and a treatment group of small dose oxymatrine injection into Zusanli (OM ZSL group). At the end of 12~ th week, the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) were determined. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expressions of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Results The number of cancer nodes on the surface of liver in the OM ip group and the OM ZSL group was lower than that in the group M, with serum ALT, AST and γ-GT levels significantly decreased ( P<0.01 ), and significantly inhibited expressions of cyclin D1, CDK4 mRNA ( P<0.01 ). Conclusion OM ip and small dose oxymatrine injection into ZSL can treat or delay hepatocarcinogenisis of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by 2-AAF. Partial mechanism of this anti-carcinoma is protecting hepatocytes possibly through improving hepatic functions, and inhibiting excessive proliferation of liver cancer cells via inhibiting the expressions of cyclin D1, CDK4 mRNA.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing is one promising technique for precision crop management, but few studies have reported the applications of such systems on nitrogen (N) estimation with multiple sensors in rice (Oryza sativa L.). This study aims to evaluate three sensors (RGB, color-infrared (CIR) and multispectral (MS) cameras) onboard UAS for the estimation of N status at individual stages and their combination with the field data collected from a two-year rice experiment. The experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016, involving different N rates, planting densities and rice cultivars, with three replicates. An Oktokopter UAS was used to acquire aerial photography at early growth stages (from tillering to booting) and field samplings were taken at a near date. Two color indices (normalized excess green index (NExG), and normalized green red difference index (NGRDI)), two near infrared vegetation indices (green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and enhanced NDVI (ENDVI)) and two red edge vegetation indices (red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), and DATT) were used to evaluate the capability of these three sensors in estimating leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA) and plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) in rice. The results demonstrated that the red edge vegetation indices derived from MS images produced the highest estimation accuracy for LNA (R2: 0.79–0.81, root mean squared error (RMSE): 1.43–1.45 g m−2) and PNA (R2: 0.81–0.84, RMSE: 2.27–2.38 g m−2). The GNDVI from CIR images yielded a moderate estimation accuracy with an all-stage model. Color indices from RGB images exhibited satisfactory performance for the pooled dataset of the tillering and jointing stages. Compared with the counterpart indices from the RGB and CIR images, the indices from the MS images performed better in most cases. These results may set strong foundations for the development of UAS-based rice growth monitoring systems, providing useful information for the real-time decision making on crop N management.",

        "abstract": "Soil total nitrogen content is regarded as an important index for soil fertility diagnosis and crop growth management direction, the rapid monitoring model and establishing optimum bands on soil nitrogen content is the key to swiftly obtain soil nutrient information and develop precision agriculture. Five types of soil (Paddy soil, Fluvo-aquic soil, Salinized fluvo-aquic soil, Saline soil, Dark soil with lime concretion) collected from the middle and eastern of China were measured in the near-infrared region (4000-10000 cm -1). According to molecular vibration characteristics of full spectrum in the near infrared region, 8 wave bands (the whole region, combination region, the first overtone region, the second overtone region including the combination of bands referred above, and the protein functional group bands) were designed for establishing calibration models adopting multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) method. The calibration models for nitrogen content in soil samples were established by Partial Least Square (PLS) regression. The results showed that the prediction effect using MSC spectra in the combination region of 4000-5500 cm -1 was the best, the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) for the calibration model were 0.90 and 0.16, respectively. Testing of the monitoring models with independent data of different types of soil samples indicated that determination coefficient and RMSE of validation were 0.91 and 0.15, respectively; RPD was 3.40.So, near-infrared diffuse reflection spectroscopy analysis technology can swiftly estimate total nitrogen content, and taking the combination band (4000-5500 cm -1) as modeling regional can get better calibration effect.",

        "abstract": "Aim Our primary objective was to establish an effective method of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for estimating leaf nitrogen content in rice,which would help with nitrogen diagnosis and dressing fertilization in rice production. Methods Using the techniques of partial least square (PLS),principal component regression (PCR) and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR),we established four NIRS-based models for estimating nitrogen content (NC) in fresh leaf and leaf powder of rice cultivars under varied nitrogen application rates. Important findings The coefficient of determination (RC2) and root mean square error for calibration (RMSEC) of NC models with fresh leaf were 0.940 and 0.226,respectively,whereas the RC2 and RMSEC of NC models with leaf powder were 0.977 and 0.136,respectively. We tested the accuracy of models with independent experiment datasets by the determination coefficient (RCV2) and root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV),and the determination coefficient (RV2) and root mean square error of external validation (RMSEP). With fresh leaf,the RCV2 and RMSECV of NC models were 0.866 and 0.243,respectively,while the RV2 was >0.800 and RMSEP was <0.500. With leaf powder,the RCV2 and RMSECV of NC models were 0.900 and 0.202,respectively,whereas the RV2 and RMSEP were 0.944 and 0.142,respectively. Overall,the performance of the models with leaf powder is better than that with fresh leaf in rice.",

        "abstract": "Wheat production is of great importance for national food security and is greatly influenced by the spatial variation of climatic variables, soils, cultivars, etc. This study used WheatGrow and CERES-Wheat models integrated with a GIS to estimate winter wheat productivity, yield gap and water use in the main wheat production regions of China. The results showed that the potential wheat yield gradually increased from south to north and from west to east, with a spatial distribution consistent with the accumulated hours of sunshine. The gap between potential and actual yield varied from 382 to 7515 kg ha, with the highest values in Shanxi, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces and the lowest values in Sichuan province. The rainfed yield decreased gradually from south to north, roughly following the pattern of the ratio of accumulated precipitation to accumulated potential evapotranspiration. Under the scenario of autoirrigation, relatively high irrigation water use efficiency was found in western Shandong and southern Sichuan, as well as in northern Henan, Shanxi and Shaanxi. Furthermore, the limiting factors were analysed, and effective measures were suggested for improving regional winter wheat productivity. These results can be helpful for national policy making and water redistribution for agricultural production in China.",

        "abstract": "The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect due to the surface reflectance anisotropy and variations in the solar and viewing geometry has been studied in the remote sensing community for several decades, and most attention was paid to the satellite sensors with large field of view (FOV), such as MODIS with a 110° FOV. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technique, the imagery acquired at UAV platform provides important information about crop growth status, which is a promising and efficient approach for precise agriculture. However, few studies explored the BRDF effect in UAV images, especially for the sensors with small FOVs. This study investigated the BRDF effect on the estimation of canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) with the UHD 185 hyperspectral imagery (27° FOV) acquired at a UAV platform. Our results from a rice field-plot experiment demonstrated that the CCC was highly correlated to the red-edge chlorophyll index derived at five different view angles. However, the regression models were significantly different among these view angles. This implied that no single CCC estimation model can be applied to the whole image for CCC mapping. The findings suggest the BRDF effect should be considered for providing reliable and consistent CCC estimation.",

Using an UV detector at 212 nm for detection, it was found that a higher signal response of TDA could be obtained under an alkaline condition. With an added suppressor before detector and a regeneration eluent (0.8 mol potassium hydroxide-KOH), the pH of eluent was changed to about 10. As a result, the signal response was magnified by about 10 times and a lower limit of quantification (LOQs) (0.77μg/L) was obtained. Intraday relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 3.6%. The average recovery of the analyte spiked in plastic playground was 96.48%-110.64%.",

        "abstract": "Simple, reliable and sensitive analytical methods to determine anticariogenic agents, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners contained in commercial gargles are necessary for evaluating their effectiveness, safety, and quality. An ion chromatography (IC) method has been described to analyze simultaneously eight anions including fluoride, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, monofluorophosphate, glycerophosphate (anticariogenic agents), sorbate (a preservative), and saccharin (an artificial sweetener) in gargles. In this IC system, we applied a mobile phased gradient elution with KOH, separation by IonPac AS18 columns, and suppressed conductivity detection. Optimized analytical conditions were further evaluated for accuracy. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the inter-day's retention time and peak area of all species were less than 0.938% and 8.731%, respectively, while RSDs of 5-day retention time and peak area were less than 1.265% and 8.934%, respectively. The correlation coefficients for targeted analytes ranged from 0.999 7 to 1.000 0. The spiked recoveries for the anions were 90% approximately 102.5%. We concluded that the method can be applied for comprehensive evaluation of commercial gargles.",

        "abstract": "The growing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has seriously affected human health and ecosystems, as a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) has regarded them as emerging contaminants. NSAID's polar nature and trace amount present in wastewater make their extraction and determination challenging in modern analytical science. Therefore, regarding the need, we herein report a rapid, sensitive and selective in-syringe solid-phase extraction (SPE) method coupled with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography and UV detector for the determination of seven NSAIDs in environmental water samples. Specifically, the NSAIDs in water samples were directly extracted by using synthesized porous covalent organic framework functionalized poly (styrene-divinyl benzene-glycidylmethacrylate) composite (COF@PS-GMA) without further cleanup procedures. The adsorption of NSAIDs on COF@PS-GMA sorbent was investigated by using adsorption isotherms and kinetic studies. Various parameters, including amount of sorbent, pH of the samples, the volume of desorption solvent, and desorption time that were involved in in-syringe SPE were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, good linearity was observed at 0.005-5.0 μg mL with method quantification limits (LOQs) estimated between 0.54-2.74 μg L. The recoveries of the seven NSAIDs at the level of 0.5, 5.0 and 20.0 μg L were ranging from 84.3% to 99.6%.",

        "title": "Predicting winter wheat growth based on integrating remote sensing and crop growth modeling techniques",
        "abstract": "Historically, remote sensing (RS) and crop growth modeling have been used independently to monitor and predict crop growth. This paper reports a growth prediction technique for winter wheat (Tritium aestivum L.) based on the integration of ground-based and space-borne remote sensing data and a winter wheat growth model (WheatGrow). Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA) of winter wheat were estimated using ASD field spectrometer, HJ-1 A/ B CCD, and Landsat-5 TM data and statistical remote sensing estimation models. This information was integrated with the WheatGrow model in three different growth stages (jointing, heading, and grain filling). Management parameters included sowing date, sowing rate, and nitrogen rate. Parameterization for regionalization of the integrated model was accomplished using the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) optimization algorithm. This integrated technique was tested on independent datasets acquired from three winter wheat field tests in different years on different winter wheat varieties and at different treatments of nitrogen rates and sowing densities, and from data obtained from study areas in Haián and Rugao counties in Jiangsu Province (in central eastern China), both of which are main production areas of high-quality, low-gluten wheat in China. The results showed that LNA, one of the most sensitive parameters within WheatGrow, was better than LAI as an integrated parameter for crop model parameter initialization with the best integration period being the heading stage. RMSE values were 5. 32 days, 14.81 kg/hm 2 and 14.11 kg/hm 2 for sowing date, sowing rate, and nitrogen rate based on the ground spectral datasets, and 6. 55 days, 13.94 kg/hm 2 and 84.97 kg/hm 2 based on the space-borne satellite images. The crop model parameterization results were poorest when the grain filling stage was used as the integration period, probably because crop growth at earlier stages would be more influenced by agronomic management measures. In addition, predicted results well described the temporal and spatial distribution of winter wheat growth status and productivity in the study area, with relative error values of 0.13, 0.18 and 0.03 for LAI, LNA and grain yield based on the ground spectral datasets, and 0. 22, 0.23 and 0.06 based on the satellite images. The error may be due to the limited simulation ability of the WheatGrow model, or it may have been generated from the process of remote sensing information extraction and the statistical remote sensing estimating models, all of which need improvement. Nevertheless, the study has provided an important step toward more routine use of using remote sensing and crop modeling techniques together to improve our ability of regional monitoring and yield prediction of winter wheat.",

        "title": "Establishment of Animal Model for Artery Bridge Conduits in CABG",
        "abstract": "Objective To establish the arterial bridge conduits model for the research of hemodynamics and physiological functionduring CABG. Methods Ten rabbits,about 12 months old,were harvested for the distal right carotid arteries and the homolateral carotid artery with the same length about 1-1.5 cm after anesthetized. Great care should be taken to avoid the injury of the tunica intima during operation. The vessels were applicably processed,and then the femoral arteries were sutured end-to-end with carotid arteries to establish the artery bridge conduits model. The defect in the femoral artery was replaced by the segment of carotid arteries harvested just now in order to prevent the lower limb necrosis. After the closure of the incision,all of the rabbits were feed for 3 weeks before reoperation to take the left carotid arteries and the femoral arteries to identify the function of vascular endothelium and the similarity of vessel constriction and pathology examination after the HE staining. Results There were no deaths in all of the rabbits. The outer diameter of the bridge conduits increased and internal diameter expanded just as the original carotid arteries without obstruction. The vessel wall became thicken because of smooth muscle adaptive hypertrophy and increase of elastic fibers. The constriction curve of resting tension of the bridge conduits behaved positive correlation under different concentration of the phenylephrine and had the similar constrictive characteristic. Conclusion The bridge conduits model we established is easy to be set up with good repeatability and feasibility and harmless to vascular endothelium.The bridge conduits are in line with the demand of bridge blood vessel level and hemodynamics in clinical practice and also have the same anatomic structure and physiological function as the original vessel. The model of bridge conduits is an ideal animal model,which can be used in the further clinical study of the physiological function of CABG bridge blood vessels.",

        "abstract": "Histone lysine methylation is known to be involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in all eukaryotes including plants. Here we show that the rice SDG714 is primarily responsible for dimethylation but not trimethylation on histone H3K9 in vivo. Overexpression of YFP-SDG714 in Arabidopsis significantly inhibits plant growth and this inhibition is associated with an enhanced level of H3K9 dimethylation. Our microarray results show that many genes essential for the plant growth and development were downregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing YFP-SDG714. By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that YFP-SDG714 is targeted to specific chromatin regions and dimethylate the H3K9, which is linked with heterochromatinization and the downregulation of genes. Most interestingly, when YFP-SDG714 production is stopped, the inhibited plants can partially restore their growth, suggesting that the perturbation of gene expression caused by YFP-SDG714 is revertible. Taken together, our results point to an important role of SDG714 in H3K9 dimethylation, suppression of gene expression and plant growth, and provide a potential method to regulate gene expression and plant development by an on-off switch of SDG714 expression.",

Based on time-course observations on leaf morphological properties (leaf length and leaf width) on main stems and tillers under different nitrogen rates and water regimes with four rice cultivars, the change patterns of leaf morphology with growth progress and environmental factors were characterized, and a dynamic model was developed to simulate time-course growth characters of different leaves on rice plant. The growth dynamics of leaf length on stem and tiller could be described with a logistic model, leaf width with conic equation, and leaf shape with exponential function and quadratic equation. The effects of nitrogen and water conditions on leaf growth were quantified by the effective values of leaf nitrogen concentration and water content. The model was validated with independent field experiment data of different nitrogen rates, and the mean RMSEs of dynamic leaf length were 3.60 cm and 3.96 cm, those of leaf width were 3.15 cm and 3.56 cm on main stem and tillers, respectively. The results indicated that the present model had a good performance in predicting morphological growth of leaf on stem and tiller in rice plant.",

This online clean-up setup has proven advantageous to improve the limit of detection, potentially diminish matrix effects, and reduce analysis time and labor.

        "abstract": "A Cu/Au modified electrode was fabricated for DC amperometric detection of amikacin in pharmaceutical injection solutions by anion-exchange chromatography. Experimental conditions such as detection potential, concentration of mobile phase on chromatographic resolution and detection sensitivity were evaluated. The column was CarboPac PA10, the mobile phase was 26 mmol/L NaOH solution, the detection potential was 0.64 V, the standard curve of amikacin was rectilinear in the range of 0.0005-0.02 g/L (r =0.9989) and 0.02-0.2 g/L (r =0.9991) . In contradistinction to bare Au electrode with PAD method, raising the pH of mobile phase for electrochemical detection to approximately 13 was not required, the catalytic sensitivity was higher and the linear range was wider. Without pre-and post-column derivatization, this method can simultaneously be used to determinate the main component and impurities in amikacin pharmaceutical injection solutions. Ease of preparation, being applied in DC detection mode and good catalytic stability confirmed the interests of this modified electrode as amperometric sensor applications in other flow-through systems.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the common practice that competitive retailers usually transship inventories between each other to increase sales, this paper studies the optimal transshipment policies of two retailers selling a same kind of seasonal or fashionable products in a same market. In the problem under investigation, before the selling period begins, both retailers hold a certain quantity of initial inventories which are non-replenishable during the selling process. Once one of the retailers has run out of its inventory, it can rely on the inventory that is transshipped from the other retailer to fulfill its customer. However, as a self-revenue maximizer, the other retailer can reject any transshipment requests. Based on a discrete-time dynamic programming model, we study the optimal transshipment policies of the two retailers, and characterize the structural properties of their revenue functions. Moreover, we conduct a comparison of the decentralized system with the centralized system where both retailers seek to maximize their joint revenue. Numerical experiments show that though transshipments can increase revenue to both retailers, however, the competition between the retailers can induce a great total welfare loss.",

The critical nitrogen concentration dilution curve model had specific biological meaning, i. e., there existed a negative power function correlation between shoot maximum dry matter (DM) and critical nitrogen concentration (Ncnc) (Yangmai 16: Ncnc = 4.65DM(-0.4); Ningmai 13: Ncnc = 4.33DM(-0.45)), the nitrogen nutrition index model could be used for accurate diagnosis of wheat plant nitrogen status, and the accumulative nitrogen deficit model could be used for quantitative regulation of nitrogen fertilizer management. The tests of the derived equations with independent experiment data (2007-2008) showed higher accuracy and reliable prediction, suggesting that the present models could be used for the diagnosis and regulation of wheat nitrogen nutrition, providing a key technical approach to precise fertilization management in wheat production.",

The localizations and quantities of ERα, ERβ, and PR were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot. The results showed that the mechanism of quercetin inhibiting the growth of ectopic endometrium on rat endometriosis model may be through the decreasing of serum FSH and LH levels and then reducing local estrogen content to make the ectopic endometrium atrophy. Quercetin can decrease the expression of ERα, ERβ, and PR in hypothalamus, pituitary, and endometrium, thereby inhibiting estrogen and progesterone binding to their receptors to play the role of antiestrogen and progesterone.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the distribution and resistance of bacteria isolated from lung and bronchoalevolar lavage(BAL). Methods: Disc diffusion test, MIC test and E-test were used to detect the antimicrobial sensitivity of bacterial isolates from lung and BAL. WHONET 5.4 was applied for analysis the bacterial sensitive data from Mohnarin member hospitals at different areas in China from Jan 1st to Dec 31th, 2008. Results: (1) 1,497 organisms from lung and BAL were collected in the survey period, including 538(36.0%) Gram positive strains and 956(64.0%) Gram negative strains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli. Staphylocccus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common bacterial isolates. (2) 28.6% and 66.7% of S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were methicillin-resistant, respectively. No vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus was detected. (3) More than 90% of Enterococcus faecalis was penicillin and ampicillin sensitive and 3.4% of the strain was vancomycin intermediate. (4) Extended spectrum β-lactamase positive rates for E. coli and K. pneumoniae were 56.8% and 36.9%, respectively. The resistant rates of E. coli against cephalosporin were from 50% to 58.6%, which was higher than those of other Enterobacteriaceae. (5) More than 90% of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to most of the effective antibacterial agents, but 45% of A. baumannii were meropenem resistant. Conclusion: The major pathogenic bacterial strains from lung and BAL are Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and glucose non-fermenters. The bacterial resistant rates of those organisms were relatively lower than those of the overall surveillance, which is valuable for clinical antibacterial agent application.",

        "abstract": "Nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) is conserved from yeast to human and facilitates the in vitro assembly of nucleosomes as a histone chaperone. Inconsistent with their proposed function in the nucleus, however, many NAP1 proteins had been reported to localize in the cytoplasm. We investigated the subcellular localization of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and rice (Oryza sativa) NAP1 family proteins first by identification of interacting partners and by direct examination of the localization of green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. Through treatment of tobacco cells with leptomycin B and mutagenesis of nuclear export signal, we demonstrated that Nicta;NAP1;1 and Orysa;NAP1;1 shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Together with the demonstration that tobacco NAP1 proteins bind histone H2A and H2B, our results support the current model and provide additional evidence that function of NAP1 as histone chaperones appears to be conserved in plants. In addition, we show that tobacco NAP1 proteins interact with tubulin and the mitotic cyclin Nicta;CYCB1;1, suggesting a role for NAP1 in microtubule dynamics. Interestingly, in spite of their high homology with the above NAP1 proteins, the other three tobacco proteins and Orysa;NAP1;2 did not show nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and were localized only in the cytoplasm. Moreover, Orysa;NAP1;3 that lacks a typical nuclear localization signal sequence was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Finally, we show that only Orysa;NAP1;3 could be phosphorylated by casein kinase 2alpha in vitro. However, this phosphorylation was not responsible for nuclear import of Orysa;NAP1;3 as being demonstrated through mutagenesis studies. Together, our results provide an important step toward elucidating the molecular mechanism of function of the NAP1 family proteins in plants.",

        "abstract": "Natural antioxidants are widely used in the life sciences. Phellinus igniarius is a historically used natural antioxidant containing a variety of active compounds. Phenols, particularly Inoscavin A and Hypholomine B, are found in the high concentrations. Better quantitative methods are needed to perform quality control in order to support further research of this mushroom. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography method coupled to photodiode-array detection and an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method (UPLC-PAD-MS) was developed to simultaneously quantify Inoscavin A and Hypholomine B levels in the medicinal fungus Phellinus igniarius. The two compounds were quantified using UPLC-PAD and UPLC-MS. The methods were accurate (mean accuracy for spiked matrix ranged from 101.5% to 105.8%), sensitive (limit of detection ranged from 0.28 to 1.14 mg L-1) and precise (the relative standard deviations ranged from 0.13 to 2.8%). Inoscavin A and Hypholomine B were purified using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), structural evaluated to meet the request of standard substances. UPLC separation was performed on a reversed-phase C18 column using gradient elution with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid over 10 min. The developed method was successfully applied to determine Inoscavin A and Hypholomine B in twelve Phellinus igniarius samples of different origins and the results showed that it was suitable for the analysis of these active components in Phellinus igniarius samples.",

An old anion exchange column IonPac(®) AS11-HC was utilized as a pre-treatment column for on-line washing of inorganic and organic interferences followed by isocratic separation of five acidic drugs with another anion exchange IonPac(®) AS12A analytical column by exploiting the column-switching technique. This novel method exhibited good linearity with correlation coefficients (r(2)) for all drugs were in the range 0.976-0.996. The limit of detection and quantification of all five acidic drugs were in the range 0.024μg/kg to 8.70μg/kg and 0.082μg/kg to 0.029mg/kg, respectively, and better recoveries in the range 81.17-112.5% with percentage relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 17.8% were obtained. This on-line sample pre-treatment method showed minimum matrix effect in the range of 0.87-1.25 except for aspirin. This simple rugged and flexible column-switching system required only 28min for maximum elimination of matrices and interferences in three complex samples extracts, isocratic separation of five acidic drugs and for the continuous regeneration of pre-treatment column prior to every subsequent analysis. Finally, this simple automated IC system was appeared so rugged and flexible, which can eliminate and wash out most of interference, impurities and matrices in complex samples, simply by adjusting the NaOH and acetonitrile concentration in washing mobile phase with maximum recoveries of acidic analytes of interest.",

        "abstract": "With the development of digital agriculture, the visualization expression of plant growth process is very important. Quantifying the dynamic process of leaf color is the basic part of plant growth visualization. At present, the study on plant leaf color visualization at home and abroad is emphasized on reversing and rebuilding crop virtual growth with the figure identifying technique in computer, however, simulation model and visualization technique based on leaf color dynamic process have not been established successfully.Modeling leaf color dynamics in rice is an important task for realizing virtual and digital plant growth. Based on time-course observations on leaf color changes at different leaf positions of stem and tillers under different nitrogen rates and water conditions with four rice cultivars, we developed a simulation model on leaf color dynamic changes in rice in relation to GDD. Leaf color changes in the model were described with SPAD in three phases. The first phase during leaf growth period was based on the exponential relationship of leaf color to cumulative GDD; the second phase during leaf function period was represented with a relative stable SPAD; the third phase during leaf senescence period was described in a quadratic equation between SPAD and GDD. In addition, the effects of nitrogen and water conditions on leaf color were quantified through the effectiveness values of leaf nitrogen concentration and water content in relation to SPAD. Then, the RGB values were further predicted from the changing SPAD. The model was validated with the independent field experiment data involving different rice cultivars and nitrogen rates. The average RMSEs between the simulated and observed SPAD dynamics at different leaf positions were 2.58, 3.69, and 3.82, respectively, for three leaf color phases on main stem, 4.65, 4.39, 3.51, and 4.25, respectively, for four individual tillers in rice, and 2.98, 3.25, respectively, for SPAD and R, G values. The results indicate that the present model has a good performance in predicting leaf color changes at different leaf positions in rice under different growth conditions, and thus lays a foundation for further constructing digital and visual rice growth system.",

        "abstract": " Polymyxins are a last-line class of antibiotics against multidrug-resistant . However, polymyxin resistance can emerge with monotherapy, highlighting the need for synergistic combination therapies. Polymyxins in combination with -lactams have shown remarkable synergy against multidrug-resistant .  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was conducted to investigate the metabolic perturbations in an  clinical isolate, AB090342, in response to colistin (1 mg/L), sulbactam (128 mg/L), and their combination at 1, 4, and 24 h. Metabolomics data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics, and metabolites showing ≥2-fold changes were subjected to pathway analysis.  The synergistic activity of colistin-sulbactam combination was initially driven by colistin through perturbation of fatty acid and phospholipid levels at 1 h. Cell wall biosynthesis was perturbed by sulbactam alone and the combination over 24 h; this was demonstrated by the decreased levels of two important precursors, uridine diphosphate--acetylglucosamine and uridine diphosphate--acetylmuramate, together with perturbed lysine and amino sugar metabolism. Moreover, sulbactam alone and the combination significantly depleted nucleotide metabolism and the associated arginine biosynthesis, glutamate metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway. Notably, the colistin-sulbactam combination decreased amino acid and nucleotide levels more dramatically at 4 h compared with both monotherapies.  This is the first metabolomics study revealing the time-dependent synergistic activity of colistin and sulbactam against , which was largely driven by sulbactam through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis. Our mechanistic findings may help optimizing synergistic colistin combinations in patients.",

        "abstract": "The exploration of highly efficient nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for potential applications in sustainable energy conversion. Recently, the layered metal hydroxide (LMH) family is receiving extensive research attention owing to its unique structural properties. However, the gained electrocatalytic performance of LMH-based catalysts for the OER is still far from the state-of-the-art requirements because of its finite number and poor reactivity of exposed active sites. In response, we synthesized crystal lattice distorted ultrathin cobalt hydroxide (denoted as CLD-u-Co(OH)2) nanosheets with a great number of efficient catalytic active sites through the introduction of Ga into ultrathin Co(OH)2, followed by a selective removal of Ga, denoted as the “introduction @ removal” process. As a result, the crystal lattice distortion confined inside CLD-u-Co(OH)2 generates abundant elongated Co–OOH bonds on exposed (10) facets serving as efficient catalytic active sites for the OER. Besides, the optimized amount of “introduction @ removal” of Ga (4 at%) allows for an exquisite balance between distortion engineering and electrical conductivity, synergistically. The as-prepared CLD-u-Co(OH)2 achieves an overpotential of 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−−2, an unexpectedly small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec−−1, and a long-term stability (beyond 20 h) in basic media. It is mainly attributed to abundant catalytic active sites, robust reactivity per site, and good electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the green and sustainable engineering of crystal lattice distortion to improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of CLD-u-Co(OH)2 nanosheets presented in this work may provide a promising strategy to design and synthesize newly highly efficient LMH-based electrocatalysts for the OER.",

The polyaniline (PANI) film showed excellent electrocatalytic activity than bare GCE and provided enhanced selectivity and stability for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA). Separated by IC with phosphate buffer solution (pH = 5.2) as eluent, AA could be determined by the PANI/GCE successfully at the working potential of 0.3 V. The retention time of AA was approximately 5.75 min, and the peak shape of AA was satisfactory. The calibration curve of AA was linear (r > 0.99), in the range between 0.05 mg/L and 1000 mg/L and the detection limit was 23.41 μg/L (S/N = 3). The proposed method was successfully applied in the detection of AA in four beverage samples. The recoveries of AA in these samples were from 92.32% to 110.57%.",

Rice LAI had good relationships with several hyper-spectral vegetation indices, the correlation coefficient being the highest with DI ( difference index), followed by with RI (ratio index), and NI (normalized index), based on the spectral reflectance or the first derivative spectra. The two best spectral indices for estimating LAI were the difference index DI(854,760) (based on two spectral bands of 850 nm and 760 nm) and the difference index DI (D676.D778) (based on two first derivative bands of 676 nm and 778 nm). In general, the hyper-spectral vegetation indices based on spectral reflectance performed better than the spectral indices based on the first derivative spectra. The tests with independent dataset suggested that the rice LAI monitoring models with difference index DI (854,760) as the variable could give an accurate LAI estimation, being available for estimation of rice LAI.",

        "abstract": "To meet the demand of intelligent irrigation for accurate moisture sensing in the soil vertical profile, a soil profile moisture sensor was designed based on the principle of high-frequency capacitance. The sensor consists of five groups of sensing probes, a data processor, and some accessory components. Low-resistivity copper rings were used as components of the sensing probes. Composable simulation of the sensor&rsquo;s sensing probes was carried out using a high-frequency structure simulator. According to the effective radiation range of electric field intensity, width and spacing of copper ring were set to 30 mm and 40 mm, respectively. A parallel resonance circuit of voltage-controlled oscillator and high-frequency inductance-capacitance (LC) was designed for signal frequency division and conditioning. A data processor was used to process moisture-related frequency signals for soil profile moisture sensing. The sensor was able to detect real-time soil moisture at the depths of 20, 30, and 50 cm and conduct online inversion of moisture in the soil layer between 0⁻100 cm. According to the calibration results, the degree of fitting (²) between the sensor&rsquo;s measuring frequency and the volumetric moisture content of soil sample was 0.99 and the relative error of the sensor consistency test was 0⁻1.17%. Field tests in different loam soils showed that measured soil moisture from our sensor reproduced the observed soil moisture dynamic well, with an ² of 0.96 and a root mean square error of 0.04. In a sensor accuracy test, the ² between the measured value of the proposed sensor and that of the Diviner2000 portable soil moisture monitoring system was higher than 0.85, with a relative error smaller than 5%. The ² between measured values and inversed soil moisture values for other soil layers were consistently higher than 0.8. According to calibration test and field test, this sensor, which features low cost, good operability, and high integration, is qualified for precise agricultural irrigation with stable performance and high accuracy.",

After leaf primordia are formed, they must establish polarity for normal leaf morphogenesis. Recent studies have led to the identification of a number of genes that participate in the class 1 KNOX gene repression and/or the leaf polarity establishment. ASTMMETRIC LEAVES1 and 2 (AS1 and AS2) are two of these genes, which are critical for both of these two processes. As a first step towards understanding the molecular genetic basis of the AS1-AS2 action, we determined the subcellular localizations of the two proteins in both tobacco BY2 cells and Arabidopsis plants, by fusing them to yellow/cyan fluorescent protein (YFP/CFP). Our data showed that AS1 and AS2 alone were predominantly localized in the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm, respectively. The presence of both AS1 and AS2 proteins in the same interphase cell demonstrated their co-localization in both nucleolus and nucleoplasm. In addition, AS1 alone was able to associate with the condensed chromosome in the metaphase cell. Our data suggest that AS1, AS2 and the AS1-AS2 protein complex may have distinct functions, which are all required for normal plant development.",

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose:Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in Europan and North American males.The incidence of prostate cancer has also been increasing during the past few decades in China.It is widely accepted that this heterogeneity,which results from the tumor progression driven largely by genomic instability(genetic and/or epigenetic alterations)of tumor cells in primary tumor,endows specific populations of tumor cells with the unique character needed for invasion,migration,and metastasis colony formation in other organs and only these subpopulations possessing thost character can survive the potentially destructive journey from the primary tumor to the sites of metastases.The purpose of the present study was to explore the genes associated with invasion and metastasis of human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M in nude mice.Methods:After PC-3M cells were inoculated into orthotopic site(prostate) in a male nude mouse for two months,tumor cells were isolated from the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis,separately.Cell invasion and adhesion ability in vitro were first compared between two cells.Then metastasis-related genes differentially expressed between them were analyzed by utilizing cDNA microarray technique.Results:The in vitro cell invasion and adhesion potential of tumor cells from lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than those from primary tumor by 2.5 fold and 1.5 fold,respectively.Metastasis-related genes differentially expressed between those two sublines were identified,all of them were up-regulated in the tumor cells from lymph node metastasis and could be categorilized: 1.genes encoding cellular matrix-degrading proteolytic enzyme including cathepsin and MMP.2.genes encoding transcription factors.3.genes related to heterotypic adhesion of tumor cells.4.genes encoding cell surface receptors.Conclusions:There are significant differences in invasion and adhesion potential between cells from primary tumor and those from lymph node metastasis.Some differentially expressed molecules might be playing pivotal roles in promoting tumor cells to migrate from primary tumors to distant metastases,which may be helpful to elucidate the possible mechanism of metastasis in prostate cancer.",

The influence of polymer concentration on IFTs was expounded. The experimental results show that betaine has high interfacial activity and the addition of polymer has great influence on both dynamic IFT behaviors and equilibrium values between surfactant solution and n-alkanes mainly by modifying the interfacial molecular arrangement on the interface. However, the addition of polymer affects the dynamic IFTs of surfactant solution against kerosene and crude oil, but has little effect on the equilibrium IFT values. Active substances existing in kerosene and the in situ produced petroleum acidic soaps play a synergistic effect with betaine to reduce the IFTs. The increase of viscosity of aqueous phase caused by polymer influence the adsorption of the surfactant at the interface, slowing down the decrease of IFTs and changing the minimum transient IFT values.",

The analytical method is based on the use of two different reversed-phased columns connected through a two-position switching valve. A baseline separation was achieved by proper selection of stationary phases, mobile phases, and the use of a gradient elution in both dimensions. Furthermore, an easy-to-handle magnetic solid-phase extraction procedure was developed for the preconcentration of 12 allergenic disperse dyes from river water. An enrichment factor of 100 times was obtained. The results showed excellent performance in terms of trueness (76.8-99.0%), precision (intraday: 2.2-8.0%, interday: 3.3-8.2%), and sensitivity (limits of determination, 0.027-1.46 μg/L). Twenty real samples collected from the outfalls in the Yaojiang, Yongjiang and Fenghuajiang estuary were analyzed, and three of the studied compounds were found in one collected sample (12.6 μg/L for disperse blue 7, 11.6 μg/L for disperse blue 106, and 0.22 μg/L for disperse blue 3).",

        "abstract": "The development of a reversed phase liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of seven angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; five drugs namely benazepril HCl (BZL), enalapril maleate (ENL), fosinopril sodium (FSP), lisinopril (LSP) and ramipril (RMP) and two metabolites captopril disulfide (CPD) and enalaprilat (ENT) together with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is described. The method can serve as a substitute for many published papers for the analysis of the targeted compounds with or without hydrochloothiazide in pharmaceutical formulations as well as in spiked human plasma and urine samples. The method utilizes a simple gradient procedure for the separation in a 11 min run time using acetonitrile aqueous ammonia buffer (pH 9) solution and an Extend RP-C18 (25 μm particle size, 4.6 mm×250 mm, Agilent) HPLC column. The effluent was monitored on a UV detector at 215 nm. The effect of pH, solvent strength and analysis time on the peak shape and quantification were carefully studied in order to optimize the method. Adopting the proposed procedure, the analytes produce well-shaped peaks with good linear relationship over the investigated concentration ranges. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) from standard drug solutions lie in the range of 17-64 and 56-212 ng mL(-1), respectively. Correlation coefficient values (r) higher than 0.997 were obtained for all the studied drugs in spiked human plasma and urine samples. The intra-day and inter-day precision of the method was evaluated with relative standard deviation values being satisfactory for their purposed analysis. The method was validated with respect to specificity, recovery, accuracy, precision and linearity.",

Forty-eight endometriosis rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: untreated group, castrate group, mifepristone group (5 mg/kg) and low- (20 g/kg), medium- (40 g/kg) and high-dose (80 g/kg) CSG group. After 21-day consecutive treatment, the expressions of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 in ectopic endometria were detected by immunohistochemical method, and the volume of the ectopic endometria was also measured by using electronic digital calipers.Compared with the untreated group, the endometrial volumes in the treated groups were significantly decreased (P<0.05) except for the low-dose CSG group. Histopathologic observation showed that the epithelial layer of ectopic endometrium was less and the thickness of epithelial layer was thinner than those in the untreated group (P<0.01), but the low-dose CSG group had few changes. The VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 expressed abundantly in the cytoplasm of the glandular epithelium and vascular endothelial cell in all the groups. Compared with the untreated group, the expressions of VEGF and Flk-1 of ectopic endometrium in the CSG-treated groups, the mifepristone group and the castrate group were significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01).CSG can treat the endometriosis in rats, and its action may be associated with decreasing the expressions of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 in ectopic endometrium.",

        "abstract": "\n With rapid development of computer graphics and crop simulation, virtual crop study that can intuitionally express crop growth\n on computer has attracted great attention from many scientists in the world, with significant progress on visualization of\n crop plants. In virtual crop modeling, leaf shape is a very important character, and has been described with empirical curves\n derived from field experiments in the previous studies. The fitting curves are helpful for understanding organ morphogenesis,\n but the parameters obtained from the specific leaves and environments are not well adapted to changing growth processes of\n leaves. So it is critical to develop a dynamic model for simulating the leaf morphology under different growth conditions.\n \n \n Organ morphogenesis of plant is associated with its forces. From force analysis on a rice leaf, the gravity fraction in leaf\n normal direction keeps equilibrium with elasticity, then a dynamic leaf curvature equation was deduced with some assumptions.\n The equation included the synthetic effects of leaf blade length, leaf blade width, initial leaf angle, specific leaf weight\n and deformation coefficient on leaf space shape. Then the equation was solved with parameterization. The sensitivity analysis\n showed that the equation could well reflect the integrated effects of leaf length, leaf width, specific leaf weight and leaf\n deformation coefficient, consistent with rice plant architecture in practice.\n \n \n \n A field experiment was conducted at the Nanjing Agricultural University using two rice cultivars (SU63 and WYG7). At jointing\n and booting stages of rice, the 3-dimension coordinates of several points along leaf midrib were measured with the 3D digitizer,\n and at the same time leaf blade length, width, initial leaf angle were obtained. Then simulation analyses on the equation\n were conducted for comparison with the experiment data. The results indicated that the leaf curvature equation could dynamically\n and reliably describe the change pattern of leaf shape characteristics of rice under different conditions, including different\n leaf angles and specific leaf weights.\n \n \n ",

By analyzing the combination structure of web services for crop model, communication features of data web services and responding time feature of web services for crop model, the concurrent processing scenario of web services for crop model was designed based on multi-thread processing and data caching technology. Taking web services of crop management knowledge model as the testing target, the effectiveness of concurrent processing scenario was verified in a real network environment. The results showed that the responding time of web service for crop model with concurrent processing scenario reduced 32% and 35% for single-user at multi-location and multi-user at multi-location, respectively, which improved the model ability for multi-user concurrent processing. These results provide the technical support for regional application of crop model.",

        "abstract": "A simple hyphenated ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-ion chromatography (UHPLC-IC) column-switching analytical method was developed for the simultaneous determination of vanillin, ethyl vanillin, and six inorganic anions (i.e., BrO3 −, Cl−, NO2 −, ClO3 −, NO3 −, and SO4 2−) in food samples. A fast ultrasound-assisted extraction method with a solvent of acetonitrile/water (3:2, v/v) was utilized. Methanol/water (30:70, v/v) and 13 mmol/L KOH were used as eluents for separation. An IonPac AG19 column was applied as the concentration column for the online pre-concentration of anions. The C18 column functioned as the analytical column for the separation of organic compounds and as the online matrix elimination column for inorganic anions. The effects of the analytical variables were systematically studied and optimized. Under optimal experimental conditions, the limits of detection for vanillin, ethyl vanillin, and inorganic anions ranged from 6.2 to 27 μg/L. The relative standard deviations of the retention time and peak area were less than 1.36 and 3.05%, respectively. The spiked recoveries were 95.73–107.3%. Experimental results demonstrated that the hyphenated UHPLC-IC column-switching analytical method could be successfully applied for the analysis of vanillin, ethyl vanillin, and inorganic anions in food samples.",

        "abstract": "Modeling leaf color dynamics in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important task for realizing virtual and digital plant growth. This study was undertaken to analyze the dynamics of leaf color changes at different leaf positions on main stems and tillers under different growing conditions, and to build a dynamic simulation model on leaf color changes in rice plant in relation to growing degree-days (GDD). Time-course observations were made on leaf color (in SPAD value) changes at different leaf positions of stem and tillers under different nitrogen rates and water regimes with four rice cultivars. Leaf color changes in SPAD could be described in three phases. The first phase during leaf elongation period was based on the exponential relationship of leaf color to cumulative GDD; the second phase during leaf function period was represented with a relative stable SPAD; the third phase during leaf senescence period was described in a quadratic equation between SPAD and GDD. In addition, the effects of nitrogen and water conditions on leaf color were quantified through the effectiveness values of leaf nitrogen concentration and water content in relation to SPAD. Then, the RGB (red, green, and blue) values were further predicted from the changing SPAD during leaf development. The model was validated with the independent field experiment data involving different rice cultivars and nitrogen rates. The average root mean square errors (RMSE) between the simulated and observed SPAD values at different leaf positions were 2.58, 3.69 and 3.82, respectively, for three leaf color phases on main stem; 4.65, 4.39, 3.51 and 4.25, respectively, for four individual tillers; and 2.98 and 3.25, respectively, for SPAD and R, G values in rice. The results indicate that the present model has a good performance in predicting leaf color changes at different leaf positions in rice under various growth conditions, and thus lays a foundation for further constructing digital and visual rice growth sys- - tem.",

        "abstract": "The proper modulation of chromatin structure is dependent on the activities of chromatin-remodeling factors and their interplays. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis chromatin-remodeler AtINO80 interacts with the actin-related protein AtARP5 and can form a larger protein complex. Genetic analysis demonstrated that AtARP5 acts in concert with AtINO80 during plant cellular proliferation and replication stress response. At the same time, AtARP5 is not required for AtINO80-mediated control of flowering time and related transcriptional regulation, and their chromatin distribution patterns on regions of flowering-repressor genes FLC/MAF4/MAF5 are also different. An in vitro DNase I digestion assay revealed that the AtINO80 N-terminus can weakly bind DNA, an interaction that is significantly inhibited by H2A.Z/H2B addition. AtARP6, a specific subunit of SWR1-C that mediates the H2A.Z exchange, was found to have a previously unexpected inhibitory role in the local chromatin enrichment of AtINO80. Further genetic analyses revealed the functional interplay between AtINO80 and AtARP6 and their critical roles in embryogenesis and post-embryonic organ development as well as the synergy of AtARP5 and AtARP6 in maintaining genomic stability. Our findings provide insights into the common and distinct roles of AtINO80 and AtARP5 in diverse aspects of plant development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Numerous cryptographic techniques have been developed to be used on mobile devices for various security and privacy protections. However, these cryptographic primitives, working under different mathematical assumptions, tend to become more and more complex and intricate, which makes it increasingly more difficult for proper implementation and management. Thus, it is desired to simplify management and improve efficiency by means of designing a general function family to meet a variety of security requirements. In this paper, we present such a family of square functions, including SqHash, SqMAC and SqPRF, based on a specially truncated function (MSB or LSB). We further improve the efficiency of these algorithms by using “circular convolution with carry bits” which makes parallel processing possible. We prove the security of these functions based on the privacy in hidden number problem and hard-core predicate of one-way function. We also show that the proposed schemes achieve better performance with a complexity reduction from O(n2) to O(kn/w) for n-bit message, k-bit output and w-bit word size.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most cataract patients combined with extreme myopia were implanted with prosthetic lens after removing cataract. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of phacoemulsification and implantation of negative-power posterior chamber intraocular lenses (IOL) in patients with extreme myopia and cataract. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The retrospective analysis experiment was performed at the Eye Center, Affiliated Hospital Weifang Medical College from October 2006 to October 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Totally 28 cataract patients combined with extreme myopia (50 eyes) received phacoemulsification and implantation of negative-power IOL. There were preoperative rectification sight < 0.1 in 45 eyes, and 0.1-0.15 in 5 eyes. Sensar AR40e intraocular lens was obtained from AMO. METHODS: Axial length and corneal curvature were measured before surgery. Diopter (D) was calculated by Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff T (Third edition). Practical diopter (D) was the measured diopter plus +1.00-+3.50 D. After anesthesia of eye surface, a 3.0 mm width incision was made on the corneosclera at 11-12 o’clock position 1.0 mm behind limbus cornea. A diameter of 5.0 mm continuous circular capsulorhexis was conducted. Lens nucleus was absorbed by phacoemulsification. Prosthetic lens with diopter (D) of -1.00--10.00 D were implanted into the sac. A follow-up was performed for 3-12 months after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative visual acuity, refractive error and complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean preoperative axial length was (32.19±2.31) mm. Best corrected visual acuity achieved 0.2 or better in 43 eyes (86.0%) and 0.5 or better in 23 eyes (46.0%). Of the 50 eyes, 25 eyes (50.0%) were within 1.00 diopter (D) of refractive error and 44 eyes (88.0%) were within an error of 2.00 D. Only 1 eye had posterior capsule rupture. At month 3, 1 eye developed posterior capsule opacification. No retinal or choroidal detachment was detected. At month 12, 5 eyes developed posterior capsule opacification. No retinal or choroidal detachment was seen. CONCLUSION: It is safe and effective for phacoemulsification and implantation of negative-power Sensar AR40e IOL in patients with extreme myopia and cataract. Negative power Sensar AR40e IOL can especially improve the stability of the tissue in eyeball prevent the occurrence of retinal detachment. Meanwhile it can correct the refractive errors.",

        "abstract": "In this study, diethylenetriamine-functional magnetic core-shell polymer modified graphene oxide (DETA-MPs-GO) was prepared via precipitation polymerization and amidation reaction, and it was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Subsequently, a magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) procedure was applied to the as-synthesized DETA-MPs-GO for the detection of nine fungicides in fruit samples, prior to ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). The homogenized fruit samples, spiked with D-labelled internal standards, were firstly extracted by 5 mL of acetonitrile twice and then purified by DETA-MPs-GO adsorbents. The optimization of the adsorption and elution conditions of DETA-MPs-GO toward fungicides was carried out to attain a satisfactory adsorption performance and desorption efficiency. The adsorption mechanism was carefully investigated, and the results revealed that a synergistic adsorption mechanism, including hydrogen bond and a π-π stacking interaction, was confirmed. Moreover, the limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the proposed approach were in the range of 0.01 to 0.30 μg/kg under the optimum conditions. The average recoveries at three spiking levels were 84.9% to 105.2%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) varying from 0.8% to 8.2% ( = 6). The developed method was successfully utilized for the screening and detection of fungicides in 81 fruit samples purchased from markets. A detailed survey was carried out about the concentration distribution, types of fungicides, and combined use of fungicides in different fruits.",

        "title": "Metformin Enhances Nomegestrol Acetate Suppressing Growth of Endometrial Cancer Cells and May Correlate to Downregulating mTOR Activity In Vitro and In Vivo.",
        "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of a novel progestin and its combination with metformin on the growth of endometrial cancer (EC) cells. Inhibitory effects of four progestins, including nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC), medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel, and cyproterone acetate, were evaluated in RL95-2, HEC-1A, and KLE cells using cell counting kit-8 assay. Flow cytometry was performed to detect cell cycle and apoptosis. The activity of Akt (protein kinase B), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and its downstream substrates 4EBP1 (4E-binding protein 1) and eIF4G (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G) were assayed by Western blotting. Nude mice were used to assess antitumor effects in vivo. NOMAC inhibited the growth of RL95-2 and HEC-1A cells, accompanied by arresting the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, inducing apoptosis, and markedly down-regulating the level of phosphorylated mTOR/4EBP1/eIF4G in both cell lines ( < 0.05). Metformin significantly increased the inhibitory effect of and apoptosis induced by NOMAC and strengthened the depressive effect of NOMAC on activity of mTOR and its downstream substrates, compared to their treatment alone ( < 0.05). In xenograft tumor tissues, metformin (100 mg/kg) enhanced the suppressive effect of NOMAC (100 mg/kg) on mTOR signaling and increased the average concentration of NOMAC by nearly 1.6 times compared to NOMAC treatment alone. Taken together, NOMAC suppressing the growth of EC cells likely correlates to down-regulating the activity of the mTOR pathway and metformin could strengthen this effect. Our findings open a new window for the selection of progestins in hormone therapy of EC.",

        "abstract": "A novel nanocomposite consisting of an amorphous seed and a molecularly imprinted covalent organic framework shell was prepared via a heterogeneous nucleation and growth method. By using ibuprofen as the dummy template, a molecularly imprinted covalent organic framework (MICOF) with a large surface area was prepared from 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and 4,4'-diaminobiphenyl. It was placed on the surface of monodisperse amorphous seeds. Owing to strong π-interaction, the MICOF@SiO nanocomposite displays fast binding kinetics, large adsorption capacities and selectivity for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Following desorption from the MICOF@SiO with methanol containing 1% ammonium hydroxide, the NSAIDs ketoprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, flurbiprofen and naproxen were quantified by HPLC with UV detection. Under optimized conditions, the method exhibits good linearity within the range of 0.002-1.0 μg mL-1, low limits of detection (0.38-2.92 μg L-1), and acceptable repeatability. The recoveries of NSAIDs at three spiking levels range from 77 to 112%, and the RSDs are <9.4%. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of NSAIDs in spiked environmental water samples. Graphical abstract A molecular imprinted covalent organic framework nanocomposite (MICOF@SiO) was prepared by heterogeneous nucleation and growth method. It was explored as a sorbent for the solid phase extraction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before determination by HPLC with UV detection.",

        "abstract": "Traditional overhead irrigation system that most nurseries have used causes heavy water waste,nutrient leaching and environment pollution. Sub-irrigation is an effective method whereby water is moved upward into the growing medium by capillary action allowing water to be reused within the closed-circuit loop. This method may produce high quality seedlings while reducing environmental and financial costs through resource conservation. Based on the latest researches,the paper introduced the background of sub-irrigation system formation and its components,and reviewed the effects of sub-irrigation in terms of seedling quality,water and fertilizer use efficiency,EC and pH in the medium and potential disease damage. In addition,this paper suggested some valuable considerations to facilitating future sub-irrigation studies and applications for foresters.",
