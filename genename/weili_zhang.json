        "abstract": "Taking advantage of the tunable conductivity of graphene under high terahertz (THz) electric field, a graphene-metal hybrid metamaterial consisting of an array of three adjoined orthogonally oriented split-ring resonators (SRRs) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to show a maximum modulation depth of 23% in transmission when the THz peak field reaches 305 kV/cm. The transmission of the sample is dominated by the antisymmetric and symmetric resonant modes originating from the strong magneto-inductive and conductive coupling among the three SRRs, respectively. Numerical simulations and model calculations based on a coupled oscillator theory were performed to explain the modulation process. It is found that the graphene coating impairs the resonances by increasing the damping of the modes and decreasing the coupling between the SRRs whereas the strong THz field restores the resonances by decreasing the conductivity of graphene.",

        "abstract": "To study the reflection and transmission properties of the gratings, a novel system based on terahertz time domain spectroscopy was established. With this system, we have synchronously measured both the reflection and transmission spectra of the deep zero-order grating with subwavelength slits. In the experiments we found that the enhanced transmission spectra of the grating are complementary to the reflection spectra, which strongly depend on the geometry of the sample and the grating pose relative to the incident THz radiation, such as leaning from incident THz radiation and slits direction of the gratings out of p-polarized radiation. The experimental results agree with the theoretical analysis based on the surface plasmon polaritons and waveguide theory.",

The operation of metamaterials at cryogenic temperatures is anticipated to be a promising path toward low-loss metamaterials since nonradiative losses are strongly suppressed due to higher charge mobility. A 14% increase in the quality factor of the resonances was experimentally observed. It was limited by the high electron scattering rate due to defects in thin films. Supplementary simulations assuming metamaterials made of thick films reveal a temperature controlled behavior and a 40% increase in the quality factor at 10 K. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics. doi:10.1063/1.3313941",

        "abstract": "Chiral materials can exhibit different levels of transmission for opposite propagation directions of the same electromagnetic wave. Here we demonstrate thermal switching of asymmetric transmission of linearly polarized terahertz waves. The effect is observed in a terahertz metamaterial containing 3D-chiral metallic inclusions and achiral vanadium dioxide inclusions. The chiral structure exhibits pronounced asymmetric transmission at room temperature when vanadium dioxide is in its insulator phase. As the metamaterial is heated, the insulator-to-metal phase transition of vanadium dioxide effectively renders the structure achiral and the transmission asymmetry vanishes. We demonstrate the effect numerically and experimentally, describe it analytically and explain the underlying physical mechanism based on simulated surface current distributions. Potential applications include directionally asymmetric active devices as well as intensity and polarization modulators for electromagnetic waves.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the effect of tweaking the quality (Q) factor of split ring resonators in a coupled state, giving rise to plasmonic induced transparency (PIT) which has two distinct, individually engineered resonance modes. The Q factor and the amplitude of each resonance are tuned by twisting them mutually in the unit cell consisting of a subradiant and a superradiant resonator. We experimentally observe that introducing a gradual twist in the three U-shape resonators has a dramatic impact on the PIT spectral response, leading to the disappearance of the transparency peak beyond a certain critical degree of twist. This mainly happens due to the change in the in-plane coupling between the resonators as well the variation in coupling of the twisted resonators with the incident electric field. Further investigation based on the Fano model provides good agreement with the experimental results. The scheme presented here for controlling the Q factor of each resonator in the coupled regime is a unique way to tune the PIT response in terahertz metamaterials and can be easily scaled across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. \u00a9 2011 Optical Society of America.",

In the absence of pumping, a resonant band-stop behavior is observed arising from metallic split-ring-resonators fabricated on an epitaxial silicon film that was already patterned into a periodic hole-array. Pumping with external infrared light, the silicon film becomes quasi-metallic, damping the planar metamaterial response and enabling a band-pass surface-plasmon resonance through the now conducting hole array. By leveraging two separate types of electromagnetic behaviors simultaneously, this composite chip paves a way for developing unique hybrid planar metamaterials. \u00a9 2011 Optical Society of America.",

        "abstract": "In present work, the dynamics of water in hydration shell of amphiphilic hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) molecules was investigated using THz and GHz dielectric relaxation spectroscopies. Different from the typical small amphiphilic molecules, HPG macromolecule provides a rather dispersionless background and allows the direct observation of four types of water molecules in the hydration shell, including bulk-like water, undercoordinated water, slow water (water molecules hydrating hydrophobic groups and water molecules accepting hydrogen bond from OH hydroxyl groups), and super slow water that are strongly hydrogen bonded to ether groups. For bulk-like water and undercoordinated water, the time constant remains invariant with HPG concentration. While, the time constant of slow water molecules increases from 15 ps to 24 ps with increase of HPG concentration. Differently, the time constant of super slow water molecules decrease dramatically with HPG concentration because of the strong hydrogen bonds to ether groups.",

As the symmetry of the unit cell resonator is broken by displacing the two gaps away from the center in opposite directions, a giant amplitude modulation is observed at the fundamental inductive-capacitive resonance due to strong polarization conversion. The modulation is nearly absent when the gaps are moved together in the same direction. This effect persists in metamaterials with different structural designs. These asymmetric metamaterials may open up new avenues toward the control of terahertz waves and the development of modulator and polarizer based terahertz devices. \u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Nodal line semimetals exhibiting line degeneracies in three-dimensional momentum space have been demonstrated recently. In general, the presence of nodal line semimetals is protected by special symmetries, such as mirror symmetry. However, these symmetries are usually necessary but not sufficient conditions, as nodal lines can be annihilated even without breaking them. Very recently, nodal line semimetal possessing an hourglass-shaped band structure emerges as a more robust candidate, where line degeneracies cannot be annihilated while preserving all underlying spatial symmetries. Here, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the presence of an hourglass nodal line (HNL) in photonic metacrystal at microwave frequency. We observe the HNL through near-field scanning of the spatial fields, followed by subsequent Fourier transformations. The observed photonic HNL resides in a clean and large frequency interval and is immune to symmetry preserving perturbation, which provides an ideal robust platform for photonic applications, such as anomalous quantum oscillation, spontaneous emission and resonant scattering.",

Our experimental results on double split-ring resonators made from different metals confirm the recent numerical simulations [Phys. Rev.

In the terahertz regime, the measured inductive-capacitive resonance is found to strengthen with a higher ratio of the real to the imaginary parts of metal permittivity, and this remains consistent at various metal thicknesses. Furthermore, we found that metamaterials made even from a generally poor metal become highly resonant owing to a drastic increase in the value of the permittivity at terahertz frequencies.",

The polarization state conversion is found to be critically related to the resonant properties of the long bars and the rings in the unit geometries and is well described by the Jones matrix.

The delay of the THz pulses and the corresponding resonantly enhanced transmission spectra through the samples are observed. To explain the extraordinary transmission we have treated the samples as Fabry-Perot resonators through resonant excitation of the coupled surface plasmon polaritons filled in the cavities between the metal slats. The experimental results are in reasonable agreement with the numerical simulation.

        "abstract": "Plasmon induced transparency (PIT) could be realized in metamaterials via interference between different resonance modes. Within the sharp transparency window, the high dispersion of the medium may lead to remarkable slow light phenomena and an enhanced nonlinear effect. However, the transparency mode is normally localized in a narrow frequency band, which thus restricts many of its applications. Here we present the simulation, implementation, and measurement of a broadband PIT metamaterial functioning in the terahertz regime. By integrating four U-shape resonators around a central bar resonator, a broad transparency window across a frequency range greater than 0.40 THz is obtained, with a central resonance frequency located at 1.01 THz. Such PIT metamaterials are promising candidates for designing slow light devices, highly sensitive sensors, and nonlinear elements operating over a broad frequency range.",

With a cascaded arrangement of two functional meta-layers, we demonstrate a nearly loss-free response at the lower frequency passband and sharp rejection characteristics at the higher frequency stopband, with a steep roll-off of 296 dB/THz. The bandwidth of the low-pass filter is easily tuned by scaling the structural parameters of the metamaterial unit cell. The low-pass filter works efficiently even at oblique angles of incidence, making it attractive for practical applications in THz signal processing.",

By choosing the steps properly for the compensation of the high-order dispersion in the CPA system, the data's oscillation for computing the high-order dispersion was decreased obviously, so we can distinctly improve total computational accuracy for compensating the dispersion of the whole system. The relative errors of final results were reduced from 11.8% to 1.3%. By optimizing the steps, the numerical method is more consummate and the dispersion in the CPA system can be compensated more completely. The optimum step range of numerical method was selected by comparing with the analytical result.",

The influence of the prism separation distance and apex-angle on second- and third-order dispersion is discussed. In certain conditions, the PW prism-sequence with small apex-angle (20\u00b0) is a better choice to reduce third-order dispersion than single prism-pair without requiring excessive length. As a less dispersion material, quartz is suitable to be used with the smallest possible value of third-order dispersion. This result could be the basis of dispersion compensation and pulse compression.",

Here, we demonstrate that the frequency shift is enlarged by increasing the SRR height, thereby potentially enhancing sensitivity and tunability. We fabricated SRRs resonating at terahertz frequencies using a focused proton beam. This resulted in SRRs nearly 10 \u03bcm high, with smooth and vertical sidewalls. Terahertz time domain spectroscopy was used for characterization. Upon applying a dielectric overlayer (=2.7), a resonance located at 640 GHz shifted by nearly 120 GHz. Simulations also indicate a widening frequency shift as SRR height increases. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

The metamaterial unit cell consists of a split ring\nsurrounded by another closed ring where their dimensions are such that their\nexcitable lowest order modes have identical resonance frequencies but very\ndifferent life times. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy verifies that the\ninterference of these two resonances results in a narrow transparency window\nlocated within a broad opaque region. In contrast to previous studies this\nenhanced transmission is achieved by independently exciting two resonances in\nwhich their coupling to the radiation field, and thus their linewidth, differs\nstrongly. Rigorous numerical simulations prove that the transparency window is\nassociated with a large group index and low losses, making the design\npotentially useful for slow light applications. This experiment opens an avenue\nto explore quantum mechanical phenomena using localized resonances in metallic\nstructures,",

        "title": "Effect of dielectric properties of metals on terahertz transmission subwavelength hole arrays",
        "abstract": "We study the influence of dielectric function of metals on the transmission properties of terahertz pulses through periodically patterned subwavelength holes. Because of a drastic increase in the value of dielectric constants, most metals become highly conductive at terahertz frequencies. Extraordinary terahertz trans- mission is observed in subwavelength hole arrays made from both good and poor electrical conductors. The measured transmittance of terahertz pulses is found to be enhanced with increasing ratio of the real to the imaginary dielectric constant of the constituent metals, for which the dielectric function follows the Drude model. \u00a9 2006 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 320.7120, 240.6680. Extraordinary transmission of light in subwave- length metallic hole arrays is generally interpreted as the result of resonant excitation of surface plas- mon polaritons (SPPs) at the metal-dielectric interfaces.1-7 The role of complex dielectric function of metals m=rm+iim is essential in the establish- ment of SPP-enhanced transmission of electromag- netic waves. For most metals, the real part of dielec- tric constant rm is negative. Experimental results on the enhanced transmission of light in metallic struc- tures revealed that the ideal metals in the optical fre- quency region are characterized by the large ratio of the real to the imaginary dielectric constant \u007frm/im1. The SPP-enhanced transmission effi- ciency of light is increased with higher ratio mission at two pronounced surface plasmon \u00b11,0 resonance modes centered at 0.55 and 1.60 THz, for metal-Si and metal-air interfaces, respectively, is in- vestigated by THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz- TDS). We find that the resonant THz transmission rises with the higher ratiorm/im for metals with dielectric function following the Drude model. This result is consistent with the observation at optical frequencies.2,6 However, because of the significant in- crease in the value of dielectric constants, the gap in the resonance peaks between arrays made from dif- ferent metals is narrowed down extensively com- pared with that of the resonant transmission of light. In particular, extraordinary THz transmission of an array made from Pb, a generally poor electrical con- ductor, is observed to approach up to a 68.2\u00b10.5% transmittance.",

Due to isotopic hydrogen/deuterium substitution, the refractive indices of methyl alcohol and isotopes vary from each other in the terahertz regime. This leads to a modification in the wave vector and consequently the resonance condition of surface plasmons excited at the metal\u2013dielectric interface. A distinct resonance shift and an amplitude modification are observed, giving high characterization sensitivity and thereby demonstrating that such plasmonic array has potential in developing new techniques in isotope distinguishing.",

        "abstract": "Metamaterials that reveal fascinating and unique resonant properties allow for adequate control of electromagnetic waves at will. Recently, considerable studies have shown that the plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) effect can be realized by metamaterials via destructive interference between different resonance modes; however, most of them are sensitive to the polarization of incident wave. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-independent PIT metamaterial functioning in the terahertz regime. The proposed structure has a fourfold symmetry and exhibits a typical PIT behavior due to the coupling effect of four different modes, yielding polarization-independent characteristics. \u00a9 1995-2012 IEEE.",

In general, these nonlinear effects are concomitant and difficult to quantitatively analyze in the time domain.

A method is proposed in the spectral domain to distinguish between Kerr nonlinearity and Kerr-like nonlinearity.

The analysis is carried out for a varying number of spiral windings. For larger numbers the structure possesses a self-complementary property which allows the application of the Mushiake principle predicting that the impedance of such structures is half the impedance of free space. This permits to observe an equal and frequency independent reflection and transmission coefficient. This property makes the spiral-type terahertz antenna not only a fascinating example of a medium supporting strong resonances in the long wavelength limit but also a medium which can be easily and reasonably homogenized at higher frequencies. This is in stark contrast to most of the existing metamaterials.",

The narrow pulse width, the high peak power of the excitation source and the central wavelength of 810nm that is the window wavelength of biological tissue show that biomedical signal induced by this light source must have high signal-noise ratio. This femtosecond laser pulse and the two-photon fluorescence technique do no harm to normal tissue surrounding the cancer. The result of our experiments shows that the cancer tissue can be distinguished and diagnosed with the method of in vivo HpD two-photon fluorescence excited by femtosecond laser pulses with suitable wavelength.",

Both the lower energy inductor-capacitor (LC) and the higher energy dipole resonances of the planar double split-ring resonators (SRRs) exhibit characteristic evolution with various sub-skin-depth thicknesses of the constituent Pb film. The signature of the LC resonance begins to emerge at a critical thickness near 0.15 skin depth. The resonances reveal a characteristic enhancement; they are strengthened remarkably with increasing SRR thicknesses at sub-skin-depth level and then gradually saturate beyond the skin depth.",

        "title": "Dynamic process of self-started self-mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser with a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror",
        "abstract": "Dynamic process of self-started self-mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser with a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) was investigated and two mode-locking starting processes were found in which one is fast and the other is slow. In the fast starting process, a mode-locking build-up time of about 400 \u03bcs was needed during which pure passive mode-locking process was caused by the SESAM and Kerr-lens mode-locking process arose from the nonlinearity of the Ti : sapphire gain medium. In the slow starting process, a build-up time of about several minutes was found in which temperature effect of the SESAM dominates the dynamic process. Keywords Ti:sapphire laser Semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) Pulse-formation dynamics are very important for understanding the mode-locking mechanisms of femtosecond lasers. Since the first self-mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser was reported [1] , pulse evolution dynamics have been widely investigated. The starting process of mode-locking initiated by an external coupled cavity [2] , a dye jet [3] , carefully designing the resonator [4] , a highly nonlinear intracavity element of ZnS [5] and a unidirectional ring resonator [6] were studied in the early 1990s for a pulse duration longer than 50 fs. Recently, the Kerr-lens mode-locked solid-state lasers started by a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) produced sub-20-fs pulses [7,8] and its pulse-formation dynamics attract more interest [9] . In this letter, we investigate the starting processes of mode-locking in a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser with a SESAM for a pulse duration 10\u201320 fs, and some new phenomena and processes are founded and reported in this letter for the first time to our knowledge. Our experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1 . The mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser with a five-mirror cavity [10] was started by a low-loss broadband SESAM [7] . In this laser, the dispersion was compensated by a pair of prisms without using chirped mirror and pulse durations of 10\u201320 fs were produced routinely. To investigate the fast starting dynamics, the laser cavity was mechanically chopped, the evolution from continue-wave (CW) to pulsed operation was detected by a fast diode, and the transient process to femtosecond was monitored by second harmonic generation (SHG) signals. Both the fundamental and SHG signals were displayed by a 400 MHz digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS-380) simultaneously. Fig. 2 shows the temporal behavior of the self-starting mode-locking of the laser in which the CW and real-time pulse train is shown in the lower trace and SHG signal in the top trace. It is obvious that the dynamics process of self-starting mode-locking could be divided into two steps. The first is the passive mode-locking process caused by the SESAM in which the average build-up time from CW to picosecond is about 300 \u03bcs (from point A to B in Fig. 2 ) with a statistical fluctuation of more than 100 \u03bcs that was found to be strongly dependent on the pump power level. The second is Kerr-lens mode-locking process caused by the nonlinearity of the Ti : sapphire gain medium in which the build-up time from picosecond to femtosecond is 100 \u03bcs (from point B to C in Fig. 2 ) without measurable statistical fluctuations. The average build-up time from CW to picosecond is strongly dependent on the pump power as shown in Fig. 3 (the modulation of the pulse train in Figs. 2 and 3 is due to the low sampling rate of the digital storage oscilloscope). It is very interesting to note that when the mode-locking was stopped by blocking the laser beam in front of SESAM for more than several minutes, the self-starting process of the mode-locking will last about 20 min. Fig. 4 shows the long-period self-starting process in which the lasing wavelength was red-shifted step by step and then suddenly band-broadened corresponding to the femtosecond regime. We attribute this phenomenon to a temperature effect caused by the heating of the SESAM sample due to nonradiative relaxation process. This will red-shift the absorption edge until the temperature at the focused point in the SESAM has reached thermal equilibrium which needs several minutes. According to semiconductor theory, the absorbing wavelength of the SESAM is red-shifted with temperature increase. Using the empirical equation proposed by Varshni [11] for the relation between band gap E ( T ) and temperature T : (1) E(T)=E(0)\u2212 aT 2 T+b , the equilibrium temperature at the focused point in the SESAM was evaluated to be 146\u00b0C in our conditions which seems to be reasonable. The SESAM sample is about 4 mm 2 in area and is stuck on a steel translational stage which needs a long time to be warmed by the laser beam to approach the high equilibrium temperature of 146\u00b0C from room temperature after the laser stopped for a long time. In conclusion, the dynamics of the self-starting mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser with SESAM was investigated and two self-starting processes, one is fast and the other is slow, were found. The fast process contains two steps in which the pure passive mode-locking due to SESAM shows statistical fluctuations and a strong pump power dependency, and the Kerr-lens mode-locking arising from the nonlinearity of gain shows a constant build-up time and pump power independence. The slow process is dominated by the temperature effect. References [1] D.E. Spence P.N. Kean W. Sibbett Opt Lett 16 1991 42 [2] U. Keller G.W. Hooft W.H. Knox J.E.

        "abstract": "Coupling between superradiant and subradiant mode resonators in a metamaterial unit cell plays an important role in observing the sharp transparency peak due to destructive interference between the resonators. This effect is enhanced as the resonators are brought closer to each other in a conventional planar arrangement. We present a novel coupling scheme of planar terahertz metamaterial to tune the plasmon-induced transparency peak by physically varying the distance between the superradiant and the subradiant resonators in such a way that the transparency peak begins to disappear as the coupled resonators are brought closer than a critical separation distance. The effect is attributed to the disappearance of the resonant behavior of the subradiant resonator in a closely coupled regime. The simple planar design presented here demonstrates a scheme to manipulate the electromagnetically induced transparency-like behavior in terahertz metamaterials and this could lead to the development of unique slow light devices for terahertz applications.",

Such wide-bandgap semiconductor materials have shown promising applications in terahertz optoelectronics. The optical, dielectric or electric proper- ties of bulk crystalline GaN, ZnO, and ZnS, and nanostructured ZnO and ZnS were characterized by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurements. Theoretical fitting based on dielectric models and effective medium models have shown good agreement with the measured results. The inves- tigation reveals that the free-standing GaN exhibits a Drude-like behavior in the terahertz region, while the dielectric response of crystalline ZnO and ZnS is dominated by low-frequency transverse optical phonon modes. The ZnO tetrapod nanostructures exhibit very similar phonon resonances with that of single-crystal ZnO, whereas the phonon confinement in ZnS nanoparticles gave rise to a difference photon response compared to the bulk ZnS.",

The experiments show that the fabricated MA has three distinctive absorption peaks at 0.5, 1.03, and 1.71 THz with absorption rates of 96.4, 96.3, and 96.7, respectively. We use the multi-reflection interference theory to investigate the physical insight of the proposed triple-band terahertz MA, which provides a design guideline for MA of such type. The theoretical predictions of the interference model have excellent agreements with experimental results. The designed multiband absorber is easy to manufacture and insensitive to incident polarizations with high absorption, which is favorable for various applications. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

Transmission measurement reveals three low-frequency vibration modes at 1.99, 2.25, and 2.61 THz, which may provide fingerprints for direct melamine detection. By combining THz-TDS with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, an overall low-frequency optical response of melamine is presented in an extended spectral range of 0.2-6.2 THz. In this range, the low-frequency vibration mode at 3.96 THz is recorded via FTIR. The measured THz spectra are well fit by the multiple-oscillator model, thereby demonstrating that the low-frequency THz response of melamine is a consequence of the lowest four vibration modes. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Optics Letters.",

Linear frequency tunability of the stopband electromagnetic response can be achieved by altering the overlap distance between the two fused shapes. Tuning does not significantly affect the strength or quality factor of the resonance. An approach to create mechanically tunable, dynamic terahertz filters is thereby suggested, with several functional advantages. Meanwhile, an effective equivalent circuit model based on self-inductance, mutual inductance, and capacitance has been proposed. \u00a9 2012 Springer-Verlag.",

Both arrays consist of high transition temperature YBCO superconductors using THz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). In the periodic subwavelength YBCO holes array, we observe a transition between a virtual excitation type surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) mode and a real SPP mode accompanied with transmission amplitude modulation. This can be attributed to the c-axis Josephson plasma frequency. On the other hand, since dipole localized surface plasmon can be excited by direct optical illuminations without phase-matching techniques, we observe a transmission amplitude modulation induced by combining the normal state carriers and the superconducting carriers in the periodic subwavelength YBCO patch array. These THz superconducting plasmonic crystals hold great potential in application for extreme low-loss, large dynamic amplitude modulation, surface plasmon-based function devices. \u00a9 2011 Chinese Optics Letters.",

For the first time to our knowledge, with a combination of 488-, 476- and 458-nm lines from Argon-ion laser as a pump source, 58-fs pulses centered at 845 nm were generated. The average output power is 30 mW, and the time-band product is 0.331, assuming a sech pulse shape. Neither Acousto-modulator nor physical aperture or slit were used in this cavity to start and sustain the Kerr-lens mode-locking operation.",

Dynamic evolution of surface-plasmon resonance in terms of array thickness is characterized by use of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the frequency range 0.1-4.5 THz. A critical thickness of lead array film is observed, above which surface-plasmon coupling of terahertz pulses begins and is enhanced rapidly as the array thickness is increased toward the skin depth. The experimental results indicate that high-efficiency extraordinary terahertz transmission can be achieved at an array thickness of only one third of skin depth. \u00a9 2005 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 320.7120, 240.6680. The extraordinary transmission of electromagnetic waves through metallic films of periodic subwave- length hole arrays has stimulated significant interest in recent years. Optical transmission efficiency higher than unity has been demonstrated when it is normalized to the area occupied by the holes.1 Be- cause of the resonant excitation of surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at the metal-dielectric interface, extraordinary optical transmission can be observed at much lower frequencies than that of the cutoff de- fined by the dimensions of the subwavelength holes.2,3 Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out not only to understand the fundamental physics behind this extraordinary transmission but also to explore the potential appli- cations in the integrated photonic devices and nano- fabrication processing.4-7 Sub-diffraction-limited nanolithography has been demonstrated by use of surface-plasmon-enhanced transmission of UV light through a subwavelength hole array.7",

        "abstract": "The realization of high refractive index is of significant interest in optical imaging with enhanced resolution. Strongly coupled subwavelength resonators were proposed and demonstrated at both optical and terahertz frequencies to enhance the refractive index due to large induced dipole moment in meta-atoms. Here, we report an alternative design for flexible free-standing terahertz metasurface in the strong coupling regime where we experimentally achieve a peak refractive index value of 14.36. We also investigate the impact of the nearest neighbor coupling in the form of frequency tuning and enhancement of the peak refractive index. We provide an analytical circuit model to explain the impact of geometrical parameters and coupling on the effective refractive index of the metasurface. The proposed meta-atom structure enables tailoring of the peak refractive index based on nearest neighbor coupling and this property offers tremendous design flexibility for transformation optics and other index-gradient devices at terahertz frequencies.",

Using transformation optics, a three-dimensional (3D) object is perceived as having a reduced number of dimensions, making it \"undetectable\" judging from the scattered field12345. Despite successful experimental demonstration at microwave and optical frequencies6789101112, the spectroscopically important Terahertz (THz) domain13141516 remains unexplored due to difficulties in fabricating cloaking devices that are optically large in all three dimensions. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a 3D THz cloaking device fabricated using a scalable Projection Microstereolithography process. The cloak operates at a broad frequency range between 0.3 and 0.6\u2005THz, and is placed over an \u03b1-lactose monohydrate absorber with rectangular shape. Characterized using angular-resolved reflection THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), the results indicate that the THz invisibility cloak has successfully concealed both the geometrical and spectroscopic signatures of the absorber, making it undetectable to the observer.",

The most common approach involves designing an array of periodic slits or grating apertures that enables coupling of the incident light to the SP modes. In recent years, plasmonic resonances, including extraordinary optical transmission through periodic arrays, quasicrystals and random aperture arrays, have been investigated in the free space. However, most of the studies have been limited to the far field detection of the transmission resonance. Here, we perform near-field measurements of the SPs on quasicrystal metasurfaces. We discover that the reciprocal vector determines the propagation modes of the SPs in the quasicrystal lattice which can be well explained by the quasi-momentum conservation rule. Our findings demonstrate vast potential in developing plasmonic metasurfaces with unique device functionalities that are controlled by the propagation modes of the SPs in quasicrystals.",

The linear polarization converter is composed of three metasurfaces and two dielectric layers interlaced with each other. The neighboring unit cells of the central metasurface layer of the linear polarization converter exhibit strong electromagnetic coupling, which increases the number of resonances and results in significant bandwidth broadening. The simulation and experimental results show that in the frequency range of 0.2 to 0.4\u2009THz, the proposed polarization converter has a flat transmission curve and exhibits a transmission efficiency that is higher than 80%. High performance terahertz polarization conversion is desirable in many fields, such as terahertz spectroscopy, imaging, and communications.",

        "abstract": "By allowing almost arbitrary distributions of amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves to be generated by a layer of sub-wavelength-size unit cells, metasurfaces have given rise to the field of meta-holography. However, holography with circularly polarized waves remains complicated as the achiral building blocks of existing meta-holograms inevitably contribute to holographic images generated by both left-handed and right-handed waves. Here we demonstrate how planar chirality enables the fully independent realization of high-efficiency meta-holograms for one circular polarization or the other. Such circular-polarization-selective meta-holograms are based on chiral building blocks that reflect either left-handed or right-handed circularly polarized waves with an orientation-dependent phase. Using terahertz waves, we experimentally demonstrate that this allows the straightforward design of reflective phase meta-holograms, where the use of alternating structures of opposite handedness yields independent holographic images for circularly polarized waves of opposite handedness with negligible polarization cross-talk.",

A small signal change induced by such films is likely to be obscured by system uncertainties. In this abstract, several possible thin-film measurement procedures are carefully considered. It is found that an alternating sample and reference measurement approach is most sensitive for thin-film sensing. Importantly, a closed-form equation is developed to determine a lower bound of sample thickness as a function of the refractive index and system uncertainties. An experimental validation shows that typical THz-TDS can detect polymer films with a thickness of a few microns. The given criterion can be used to evaluate the system performance with respect to thin-film sensing.",

        "abstract": "The collective coherent interactions in a meta-atom lattice are the key to myriad applications and functionalities offered by metasurfaces. We demonstrate a collective coherent response of the nearest neighbor coupled split-ring resonators whose resonance shift decays exponentially in the strong near-field coupled regime. This occurs due to the dominant magnetic coupling between the nearest neighbors which leads to the decay of the electromagnetic near fields. Based on the size scaling behavior of the different periodicity metasurfaces, we identified a collective coherent metasurface ruler equation. From the coherent behavior, we also show that the near-field coupling in a metasurface lattice exists even when the periodicity exceeds the resonator size. The identification of a universal coherence in metasurfaces and their scaling behavior would enable the design of novel metadevices whose spectral tuning response based on near-field effects could be calibrated across microwave, terahertz, infrared, and the optical parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.",

Recently, asymmetric excitation of SPs has attracted enormous interest. In free space, the analog of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in metamaterials has been widely investigated to uniquely manipulate the electromagnetic waves. In the near field, we show that the dark mode coupling mechanism of the classical EIT effect enables an exotic and straightforward excitation of SPs in a metasurface system. This leads to not only resonant excitation of asymmetric SPs but also controllable exotic SP focusing by the use of the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Our experimental findings manifest the potential of developing plasmonic metadevices with unique functionalities.",

        "abstract": "Plasmonic dimers that made from two subwavelength particles have drawn much attention in the recent years, which are quite promising in local field enhancement, sensing, high frequency conductance probing and electron tunneling. In this work, we experimentally investigate the mode transition effect of different plasmonic resonances in double-ring dimers when introducing conductive junction at the dimer gap in the terahertz regime. Without the junction, the dimers support a single dipolar bonding dimer plasmonic (BDP) mode. With the junction of a high conductance, two new resonance modes-a screened BDP (SBDP) mode and a charge transfer plasmonic (CTP) mode emerge. Such effect is proved to be unrelated to the shape of the rings, whether circular, square or triangular. However, the resonance statuses of the specific modes are different. Furthermore, we also experimentally study the controllable mode resonance behavior as the conductivity of the junction gradually changes by using superconducting material, and meanwhile numerically investigate the active mode transition behavior as well as the threshold effect. These results show great potential in applications of plasmonic sensing, spectral modulating and optical switching.",

However, the sensitivity of the atomically thin graphene monolayer towards sharp Fano resonant terahertz metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate thin-film sensing of the graphene monolayer with a high quality factor terahertz Fano resonance in metasurfaces consisting of a two-dimensional array of asymmetric resonators. A drastic change in the transmission amplitude of the Fano resonance was observed due to strong interactions between the monolayer graphene and the tightly confined electric fields in the capacitive gaps of the Fano resonator. The deep-subwavelength sensing of the atomically thin monolayer graphene further highlights the extreme sensitivity of the resonant electric field excited at the dark Fano resonance, allowing the detection of an analyte that is \u03bb/1\u2009000\u2009000 thinner than the free space wavelength.",

During the past decades, holography has gained enormous interest and achievements in free-space three-dimensional displays. Here, by applying a two-dimensional version of holography, we experimentally demonstrate a generic method to control the SP profiles. Through controlling the orientation angles of two separated slits under circular polarization incidence, the amplitude and phase of the excited SPs can be freely manipulated, which allows direct generation of the desired SP profiles. A series of controllable SP holography schemes are theoretically and experimentally demonstrated, where the holographic SP profiles with high imaging quality can be dynamically modulated by varying the circular polarization handedness or orientation angle of linear polarization. The universality and simplicity of the proposed design strategies would offer promising opportunities for practical plasmonic applications.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT   It is shown that active-tunable terahertz absorbers can be realized in a sandwich-structured system comprising an ultrathin dielectric film (polyimide) on a temperature-sensitive substrate (InSb) with a metal film on the back by utilizing the intrinsic carrier density ( N ) variation in InSb. When increasing the temperature from 250 to 320 K,  N  in InSb varied from ~\u00a05.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 15  to ~\u00a02.98\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 16  cm -3 . Fixing the thickness of dielectric film with the value of 1.37 \u03bcm, the absorption peak shifted from 1.41 to 3.29 THz while keeping absorption higher than 99%. This active tunability can respond to even a slight temperature perturbation, and shows polarization insensitivity as well as high tolerance of incidence-angle (absorption peak can still exceed 90% even the incidence angle reaches 60\u00b0). Besides, the refractive index of polyimide (PI) has thermal stability at the terahertz range and the merit of good workability. These characteristics guarantee the stability of active-tunable performance. The peculiarities and innovations of this proposal promise a wide range of high efficiency terahertz devices, such as thermal sensors, spatial light modulators (SLMs) and so on.",

        "abstract": "Plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) is a key addition to mimicking the quantum phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic systems. So far, various metamaterial structures have been proposed to excite and manipulate the PIT effect. However, most of the reported works were based on 2-D metal structures, and consequently, the PIT phenomena often arise from their electric responses. Here, we propose a novel PIT metamaterial scheme based on three vertically placed split ring resonators (SRRs) working at terahertz frequencies. This stereo structure, with a typical EIT-like transmission, couples to both the electric and magnetic fields of the normally incident wave. We numerically demonstrate that the coupling between the radiative and subradiative elements can be modulated not only by their mutual separation but also by the vertical height of the SRRs. In addition, a classical Fano resonance model is applied to explain the coupling effects of EIT-like transmission spectra, which is in good accordance with the numerical results. Considering the higher design freedom of the stereo metamaterials, our work provides a promising way for PIT metamaterial and terahertz slow light device research.",

Here, we propose a tensor coding metasurface at terahertz (THz) frequency that could take full-state controls of an electromagnetic wave in terms of its polarization state, phase and amplitude distributions, and wave-vector mode. Owing to the off-diagonal elements that dominant in the reflection matrix, each coding particle could reflect the normally incident wave to its cross-polarization with controllable phases, resulting in different coding digits. A 3-bit tensor coding metasurface with three coding sequences is taken as an example to show its full-state controls in reflecting a normally incident THz beam to anomalous directions with cross-polarizations and making a spatially propagating wave (PW) to surface wave (SW) conversion at the THz frequency. We show that the proposed PW-SW convertor based on the tensor coding metasurface supports both x- and y-polarized normal incidences, producing cross-polarized transverse-magnetic and transverse-electric modes of THz SWs, respectively.",

        "abstract": "We present terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to explore the conformational dynamics of thermally induced and photoinduced isomerization of azobenzene. The essence of the method is that isomerization of azobenzene proceeds via large structural changes in the molecule, while the THz response is sensitive to these changes. We experimentally demonstrate that the THz spectra of azobenzene show remarkable variations upon heating and irradiation, and as such quantitatively recorded and identified THz spectroscopy can be used to monitor the isomerization process. Specifically, the measured THz spectra clearly reveal that the rate of thermal-isomerization from cis-to-trans in non-polar solvents is faster than that in polar solvents, and an about 6-fold acceleration of the rate could be achieved when Au NPs were introduced as a catalyst into azobenzenes. Moreover, we provide evidence that the temperature and Au NP catalyst do not have an obvious influence on the photoinduced isomerization of azobenzene. The presented example illustrates the power of the THz-TDS method to open up a novel avenue for exploring molecular dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Superconducting terahertz metamaterials have attracted significant interest due to low loss, efficient resonance switching and large-range frequency tunability. The super conductivity in the metamaterials dramatically reduces ohmic loss and absorption to levels suitable for novel devices over a broad range of electromagnetic spectrum. Most metamaterials utilize subwavelength-scale split-ring resonators as unit building blocks, which are proved to support fundamental inductive-capacitive resonance, to achieve unique resonance performance. We presented a review of terahertz superconducting metamaterials and their implementation in multifunctional devices. We began with the recent development of superconducting metamaterials and their potential applications in controlling and manipulating terahertz waves. Then we explored the tuning behaviors of resonance properties in several typical, actively controllable metamaterials through integrating active components. Finally, the ultrafast dynamic nonlinear response to high intensity terahertz field in the superconducting metamaterials was presented.",

The analysis shows that nitrogen atoms in the films mainly take the form of C\u2013N bonds, which limits the forming of C\u2013H bonds because the formation energy of C\u2013N bond is higher than that of C\u2013H bond. So the C\u2013H bond in a-C/H film is easily decomposed, which increases the graphitization of film by laser annealing. On the other hand, C\u2013N bonds are hardly decomposed in the course of laser annealing, then we consider that thermal stability of a-C/H(N) film increases with the increment of nitrogen content.

DLC thin films reduce the influence of different ambients to PS, which can cause the desorption of hydrogen molecules from the Si\u2013H x bonds leaving dangling bonds which operate as non-radiative recombination traps. So DLC thin films can lead to a more stable luminescence from PS layers. At the same time, hydrogenated carbon nitride films can further enhance the photoluminescence efficiency of PS because more dangling bonds are passivated by nitridation.",

It is found that the establishment of appropriate model has great influence on the fit of ellipsometric spectra. The films on silicon substrates are described by a two-layer film model.

        "title": "Electrical conductivity of nitride carbon films with different nitrogen content",
        "abstract": "The electrical conductivity of nitride carbon (DLC: N) films has been studied. It is found that the electrical conductivity of the deposited films increases slowly with increasing nitrogen content, however, it decreases after the nitrogen content in the film reaches a certain value of 12.8 at%. Thermal treatment results show that the electrical conductivity of the lowly nitrogen doped DLC film increases rapidly, while that of the heavily doped film decreases after annealing at 300 \u00b0C for 30 min. Raman and XPS spectra results show that when the nitrogen content in the films reaches a certain value, there appears nonconductive phases. Therefore the electrical conductivity of the heavily doped films decreases. FTIR spectra analysis results show that the nitrogen atom as an impurity center undergoes an \u2018activation\u2019 process during the thermal treatment, which leads to the increase of the electrical conductivity. Therefore, the nitrogen in these two kinds of films has different effects on the electrical conductivity. PACS 73.61.J 81.40.E Keywords A. Nitride carbon film D. Electrical conductivity D. Annealing effect 1 Introduction \u03b1-Si/H film can be made into semiconductor by doping, and then be used in the field of microelectronics extensively. Compared with \u03b1-Si/H film, DLC film has sp 2 and sp 1 bonding fractions but the sp 3 bonding fraction. They, respectively, form diamond, graphite and the linear or annular carbon chain. So, the chemical bond structure of DLC film is more complicated than that of \u03b1-Si/H film. The electrical conduction of DLC film by doping is not sure because there exists three bonding fractions [1] . Take the nitrogen atom for example, if there still exists an unpaired electron in nitrogen atom after the incorporation of nitrogen into the DLC film, the nitrogen can contribute to the electrical conductivity; however, if the nitrogen atom has only nonbonding lone pair electrons remained, the DLC: N film cannot show the doping effect. Silva et al. [2] reported that there were nine binding modes of nitrogen in the DLC: N film, but only three of them contribute to the electrical conductivity, shown in Fig. 1 . On the other hand, there will appear \u03b1-CN x phase in the DLC: N film if we increase the nitrogen content [3,4] . \u03b1-CN x has some properties similar to that of \u03b2-C 3 N 4 . Someone has predicted that the mechanical properties of \u03b2-C 3 N 4 is superior to that of diamond, which arouses the study interest [5\u20138] . Many groups reported their research of the mechanical property and application of \u03b1-CN x film [9\u201312] . In this paper, we focus on the electrical conductivity of nitride carbon film. 2 Experiment and result 2.1 Experimental detail The DLC: N films were deposited on the n -type (001) silicon wafer by the RFPCVD method. The thickness of specimen is about 300 nm. The Au electrode was evaporated on the DLC: N film, while the Al electrode was evaporated on the back of the silicon wafer. The structure of samples used for electrical measurement shows in Fig. 2 . The specimens were annealed separately at the temperature of 300 and 400 \u00b0C at the N 2 atmosphere for 30 min. The I\u2013V curve was measured by the HP 4140B microcurrent setup. The setup of XPS is PHI550 ESCA/SAM. 2.2 Electrical conductivity of DLC: N film The I\u2013V curves of DLC: N films are shown in Fig. 3 . According to the curves, we knew that the incorporation of nitrogen in the film changed the electrical conductivity. However, the electrical conductivity increased only two orders of magnitude with the increase of nitrogen content in the film (from 0 to 12.8 at%). The values of electrical conductivity are shown in Table 1 . In our experiment, we have deposited 15 samples. In Table 1 , we only list six of them in accordance with Fig. 3 , which includes the maximum and minimum values of the electrical conductivity. 2.3 The annealing effect on the electrical conductivity of DLC: N film The specimens were annealed separately at the temperature of 300 and 400 \u00b0C at the N 2 atmosphere for 30 min. The I\u2013V curves of DLC: N films containing 10.4 at% nitrogen before and after annealing are shown in Fig. 4 . From it we knew the electrical conductivity of DLC: N films annealed at 300 \u00b0C was increased by 1.5\u20132 orders of magnitude while the electrical conductivity of the films annealed at 400 \u00b0C was increased by four orders of magnitude. The I\u2013V curves of DLC: N films containing 12.8 at% nitrogen before and after annealing at 300 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 5 . The DLC: N films used in Fig. 5 had same annealing conditions to that of films used in Fig. 4 . From it we knew the electrical conductivity was not increased by annealing at 300 \u00b0C, reversely, it was decreased at the low voltage. 3 Discussion From Fig. 3 , we knew the electrical conductivity of films was increased by 1.5\u20132 orders of magnitude with nitrogen increasing from 0 to 10.4 at%. However, when the nitrogen content was 12.8 at%, the electrical conductivity was decreased by 0.5 orders of magnitude. It is due to the appearance of \u03b1-CN x phase which is nonconductive in the films when the nitrogen content reaches certain concentration, which decreases the concentration of effective donor nitrogen in the films. Therefore, the electrical conductivity of heavily doped films was decreased. The existence, concentration and bond property of \u03b1-CN x can be confirmed by Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 6 shows the decomposed Raman spectrum of DLC: N film containing 12.8 at% nitrogen. From it we knew the Raman spectrum could be fitted into four peaks at the position of 1289.6, 1367.9, 1504.0, and 1598.1 cm \u22121 . Two of them were D and G peaks of DLC, respectively; the other two located at 1289.6 and 1598.1 cm \u22121 , respectively, corresponded to C 3 N 4 [13] . It was reasonable to believe that the existence of amorphous carbon nitride (\u03b1-CN x ). Fig. 7 shows the XPS spectra of heavily doped DLC film (12.8 at%). Both the C1s and N1s lines can be deconvoluted into Gaussian components, which are interpreted as a result of the formation of two distinguishable carbon nitride phases. Similar to the result reported in the literature, [14] there are three characteristic Gaussian peaks in the C1s spectra and two in the N1s spectra. In the C1s spectra, the peak at a binding energy of 284.17 eV was identified as originated from amorphous carbon structures. The other two peaks at 284.74 and 286.34 eV reflected two different binding states between carbon and nitrogen. Correspondingly, only two peaks at 399.13 and 400.41 eV were selected to make the best Gaussian fits in the nitrogen spectra. Similar to the analysis reported in Ref. [14] , the peaks at 286.34 and 399.13 eV were taken as a pair and were assigned as C 1 and N 1 peaks of carbon nitride phase 1, which resembled those of the predicted \u03b2-C 3 N 4 structure containing only C\u2013N bonds. The 284.74 and 400.41 eV were taken as another pair and were assigned as C 2 and N 2 peaks of phase 2 which represented a CN x phase and contained a mixture of C\u2013N,C\ue605N and C\ue606N bonds. From Fig. 4 , we knew that heat treatment could increase the electrical conductivity of DLC: N films (the electrical conductivity of DLC: N films containing 10.4 at% nitrogen annealed at 400 \u00b0C for 30 min was increased by four orders of magnitude). The annealing mechanism can be described by the following decomposition reactions: (1) (2) (3) According to the reactions, we can see during the deposition of the DLC: N films, large quantity of C and N atoms could not form the C\u2013C and C\u2013N bonds because of the low energy density of RF field. They exist as the form of hanging bonds that are easily saturated by the H atom. If the H atom saturates them, the nitrogen atoms do not contribute to the electrical conductivity even they situated at the position showed at Fig. 1 . In Fig. 8 , the appearance of peak at 3300 cm \u22121 proved the existence of N\u2013H bond, which explained the low doping efficiency before annealing. In the course of annealing, the \u2018saturated hanging bonds\u2019 such as N\u2013H bonds were decomposed, which led to the decrease of the density of N\u2013H peak at 3300 cm \u22121 , C\u2013H peak at 2900 cm \u22121 in FTIR spectra. ****In the electrical view, this is the \u2018activation\u2019 process of impurity center, which means N can be activated by heat treatment. Therefore, annealing increased the electrical conductivities of films. If the decomposed C is sp 3 configuration, it does not affect the electrical conductivity, and otherwise, if the decomposed C is sp 2 configuration, the decomposition of C\u2013H will lead to graphitization in DLC: N film, which contributes to the electrical conductivity. If the annealing temperature is higher than 400 \u00b0C, the C\u2013C bond will be decomposed, which leads to graphitization in DLC: N film. At this case, the electrical conductivity can be increased but the other properties will be worsened. We do not hope to see this result while studying the DLC films. There will appear \u03b2-C 3 N 4 and \u03b1-CN x phases when the nitrogen content exceeds 12.8 at% in the films. The concentration of them change a little with annealing, therefore the electrical conductivity of heavily doped DLC films change a little after heat treatment, which can explain the I\u2013V curves shown in Fig. 5 . 4 Conclusion From the experiment and its analysis, we observe two effects of nitrogen on the electrical conductivity: (1) If the nitrogen content in the films is low, the valence electrons of nitrogen as the impurity center can be saturated easily by H, the doping effect is not obvious; after suitable annealing, the N\u2013H bond can be decomposed, which activates the impurity center, then the electrical conductivity increases. (2) If the nitrogen content in the films is high, there will appear nonconductive carbon nitride, therefore, the electrical conductivity of heavily doped DLC films decreases, annealing at 300 \u00b0C has a little effect on it.

Residual stresses in the films are evaluated by Raman spectroscopy and a more reliable method for stress determination is presented for the quantitative measurement of stress evolution. It is found that compressive stresses in the diamond films can be partly offset by the compressive stresses in the alumina substrates, which are caused by the ion pre-implantation. At the same time, the difference between the offset by the pre-stressed substrates and the total stress reduction indicates that some other mechanisms are also active.",

However, it encounters a severe problem, that is, positive charge accumulation which can be avoided by reducing the surface resistivity of insulating substrate. So, diamond-like carbon (DLC) film is deposited on D263 glass to modify its electrical properties as substrate for MSGC. DLC film has optical smoothness and strong adhesive force on D263 glass, which helps fabricate microelectrodes on it. Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that DLC film is of sp 3 and sp 2 bonds corresponding to the occupied bonding (\u03c3) states and the empty antibonding (\u03c3 * ) states, and therefore it is a type of electronically conducting material. I \u2013 V plots indicate that three samples enjoy very steady resistivities between 10 9 \u03a9 cm and 10 12 \u03a9 cm, especially the DLC film under high electrical field over 10 4 V cm \u22121 , which meet the optimum requirements of MSGC. DLC film/D263 glass composite substrate is essential for MSGC to avoid charge-up.",

The analytical results show that nitrogen atoms in the films as C-N bond form limit C-H bonds to form due to that the formation energy of C-N bond is higher than that of C-H bond. So the C-H bonds in a-C: H film are easy to decompose and cause graphitization of film during laser annealing. C-N bonds are hardly to decompose during laser annealing so that it can be considered that a-C: H(N) film has higher thermal stability with the increase of its nitrogen content.",

The effect of Val297Ile on the binding ability of VEGFR-2 to VEGF was determined by a radioligand binding assay.The frequencies of carriers with variant 297Ile were significantly higher in patients with hemorrhagic stroke than in controls [297Val/Ile: 155(30.6%) versus 351 (19.5%), 297Ile/Ile: 18 (3.2%) versus 16 (1.0%); P < 0.01]. The variant 297Ile was significantly associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (odds ratio 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.70-2.96; P < 0.01), and replication in the second stroke study obtained similar results. The substitution of Val to Ile at the amino acid residue 297 led to an increased equilibrium dissolved constant between VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-2 [297Val (87 +/- 9) pmol/L versus 297Ile (195 +/- 36) pmol/L, P < 0.01].The VEGFR-2 gene variants may serve as novel genetic markers for the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.",

        "abstract": "Our purpose was to determine whether the common polymorphisms (SNP-604, SNP1192, and SNP1719) in KDR are associated with risk of coronary heart disease.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor KDR (kinase insert domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase-1, also called VEGFR2) play critical roles in angiogenesis and vascular repair, which are involved in the progress of coronary heart disease.The association of the 3 polymorphisms with risk of coronary heart disease was determined in 2 independent case-control studies: one comprised of 665 patients with coronary heart disease and 1,015 control subjects, and the other comprised of 369 patients and 625 control subjects. The SNP functions of KDR gene were studied by using luciferase reporter assays, determination of serum levels of KDR, and ligand-binding assays.The 2 independent population studies showed that the 3 polymorphisms were associated with risk of coronary heart disease with odds ratios of 1.37 for SNP-604 (p = 0.006), 1.41 for SNP1192 (p = 0.011), and 1.37 for SNP1719 (p = 0.007) in the first population, and 1.40 for SNP-604 (p = 0.015), 1.75 for SNP1192 (p = 0.003), and 1.50 for SNP1719 (p = 0.010) in the second population. The SNP-604C-bearing KDR promoter exhibited 68% of lower transcription activity than the SNP-604T-bearing promoter. The SNP1192 and SNP1719 could obviously influence the efficiency of VEGF binding to KDR.The KDR polymorphisms may serve as novel genetic markers for the risk of coronary heart disease.",

PCR assay was used to detect the alleles of these microsatellite in 294 patients of cerebral apoplexy, aged 58, and 325 sex, age and geographically-match controls in 7 cities in China. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on the ABI 377 DNA sequencer and analyzed with Genescana and Genotypera software. The frequencies of these markers in these stroke patients and controls were compared by c2 test. Total 294 patients with stroke and 325 age, sex, and geographically matched controls were randomly selected from 973 case-control population. Eight loci including D11S1361, D19S927, D7S483, D14S990, D15S993, D1S2622, D1S2876 and D3S3560 were detected by fluorescence-based genotyping approach.Except for the alleles of D11S1361, the size, frequency, heterozygosity, and polymorphism information in the alleles of the other 7 microsatellite sites were in the range of 0.63 - 0.81 and their distribution varies in different races and populations. between Chinese and Caucasians. There were no differences in the frequencies of main alleles between the case group and control group (all P > or = 0.05).The selected seven markers are highly polymorphic and variable between human populations, and the genomic control data indicate that there is no unequal genetic admixture and stratification in the case-control cohort.",

        "abstract": "The haplotypes in the gene vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) have been found to affect warfarin dose response through effects on the formation of reduced-form vitamin K, a cofactor for gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, which is involved in the coagulation cascade and has a potential impact on atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that VKORC1-dependent effects on the coagulation cascade and atherosclerosis would contribute to susceptibility for vascular diseases.To test the hypothesis, we studied the association of polymorphisms of VKORC1 with stroke (1811 patients), coronary heart disease (740 patients), and aortic dissection (253 patients) compared with matched controls (n=1811, 740, and 416, respectively). Five common noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms of VKORC1 were identified in a natural haplotype block with strong linkage disequilibrium (D'>0.9, r2>0.9), then single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +2255 in the block was selected for the association study. We found that the presence of the C allele of the +2255 locus conferred almost twice the risk of vascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] .58 to 2.41, P<0.001 for stroke; OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.38, P<0.01 for coronary heart disease; and OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.48, P<0.05 for aortic dissection). We also observed that subjects with the CC and CT genotypes had lower levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (a regulator for the bone), probably vascular calcification, and lower levels of protein induced in vitamin K absence or antagonism II (PIVKA-II, a des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) than those with TT genotypes.The haplotype of VKORC1 may serve as a novel genetic marker for the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and aortic dissection.",

METHODS: Totally\t3940 subjects aged over 40 years in March 2000 were selected from Qingdao port of Shandong. Investigation was conducted by questionnaires according to risk factors of cardiovascular disease:\u2460Questionnaire: General status (Age, sex, profession, marriage etc. of subjects), past history of illness (history of coronary artery disease, stroke etc.), personal history (history of smoking, drinking etc.) and family history and so on.\u2461Physical examination: measurement of height, body mass and blood pressure, inspect of heart and lung.\u2462Electrocardiography.\u2463Hematological inspect (analyses of blood lipid, blood fat, plasma tHcy and serum creatinine etc.) Diagnostic criteria of plasma tHcy: Level of tHcy in 75 % percentage of physically examined subjects were taken as the standard in dividing groups, ie. 17 \u03bcmol/L was the dividing point. Those above this dividing point were taken as plasma tHcy. Characteristics in distribution of tHcy and risk factors of traditional cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 3 940 subjects including 2 937 males and 1003 females were included in the investigation; Mean age was (53\u00b19) years. Distribution of plasma tHcy in 3 940 included subjects ranged 2.53-115.77 \u03bcmol/L. \u2460Geometric mean of plasma tHcy: 14.98 \u03bcmol/l in males and 11.33 \u03bcmol/L in females respectively, that in males was higher than that in females (P < 0.001).\u2461Level of total HCA in males of each age group were higher than those in females (P < 0.05); Levels of plasma tHcy in groups with patients aged over 60 years were higher than those aged below than 60 years (P < 0.05).\u2462Multiple Logistic regression analysis: there were positive correlations between level of plasma tHcy and male, age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, creatinine clearance ratio and histories of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. CONCLUSION:\u2460Levels of plasma tHcy in middle and elderly people of Qingdao port are various in different ages and sexes.\u2461The important risk factors of plasma tHcy in population includes male,age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, creatinine clearance ratio and history of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "The 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, an important regulator in the biosynthesis of proinflammatory leukotrienes, has been reported to confer risks for cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The purpose of this study is to assess whether genetic variants in the ALOX5AP encoding the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein will influence the risk for stroke in the Chinese population. A total of 1 773 patients with stroke and 1 713 controls were recruited from seven clinical centers. Polymorphisms of SG13S114T/A and SG13S89G/A in the ALOX5AP were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction and the restriction enzyme analysis. The multi-variate logistic regression model was used to exclude the influence of the conventional vascular risk factors on stroke. The fre-quency of SG13S114A allele in the ALOX5AP was significantly higher in male patients with thrombotic stroke (33.6%) than in controls (29.2%; P=0.014). The SG13S114AA genotype was significantly associated with a 1.62-fold risk for thrombotic stroke in men (95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.35; P=0.012). The SG13S89G/A variant was not associated with stroke or its subtypes. Haplotype analysis showed no significant differences between stroke patients and controls. The present study suggested that a common genetic variant SG13S114T/A in the ALOX5AP gene is associated with an increased risk for atherothrombotic stroke in Chinese males, and racial differences in allele and genotype frequencies may account partially for the different association findings between populations.",

Hypertension is an independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease. However, the prevalence and risk factors of PAD in hypertensive patients have not been studied in China.In order to investigate the prevalence of PAD and its risk factors in China, a cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 4716 patients with hypertension and 833 age-gender matched people without hypertension were recruited; age 40 to 75 years, from seven rural communities. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <or= 0.9 in either leg; hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >or=140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >or=90 mm Hg, or history of antihypertensive drug use.The prevalence of PAD is 8.7% (n = 408) in patients with hypertension (n = 4716), higher than in people without hypertension (5.0%, n = 833, P = .004). Hypertensive patients with PAD were older, (61 +/- 8.6 vs 58 +/- 8.6, P < .01), had more conventional cardiovascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure (170 +/- 22.6 vs 167 +/- 22.7, P < .01), pulse pressure (72 +/- 19.7 vs 68 +/- 18.9, P < .01), blood glucose (5.8 +/- 2.2 vs 5.6 +/- 1.7, P < .05), total cholesterol (5.7 +/- 1.3 vs 5.5 +/- 1.1, P < .05), and serum uric acid (355 +/- 98.0 vs 293 +/- 86.2, P < .05) than the hypertensive patients without PAD. After adjusting for gender, age, and other cardiovascular risk factors by using multiple logistical regression analysis, PAD was still associated with current smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-2.29), history of stroke (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.12-2.00), serum uric acid (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.59), and total cholesterol (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.59).This study reports, for the first time, the prevalence of PAD in Chinese patients with hypertension, which is quite different from that in westerners, and that PAD is independently associated with conventional cardiovascular risk factors.",

The clinical characteristics of patients (such as age, gender, race, obese, hypertension, and diabetes) and environmental risk factors (such as smoking and alcohol use) affect the drug efficacy and safety. Emerging evidence showed that genetic factors may significantly contribute to the individual variability observed in the response to ACS pharmacotherapy. The field of pharmacogenomics aims to discover these genetic determinants to identify individuals who are most likely to respond, experience an ADR, or benefit from an alternative dosing regimen for a given drug, and may eventually provide guidance to the optimized pharmacotherapy for ACS. In this review, we summarized the pharmacogenomic data related to cardiovascular drug efficacy and toxicity, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, fibrinolytics, beta blockers, and neurohormonal inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is clinically characterized by a sustained elevation in mean pulmonary artery pressure leading to significant morbidity and mortality, is caused by intense remodeling of small pulmonary arteries by endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation. Genetic studies in familial PAH (FPAH) have revealed heterozygous germline mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2), a receptor for the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/BMP superfamily. In this study, we conducted mutation screening in the promoter region and the entire coding regions as well as the intron/exon boundaries of the BMPR2 gene in 20 Chinese patients with either idiopathic or FPAH. All novel detected mutations were excluded by their presence in a panel of 200 chromosomes from normal individuals. A novel mutation, G-669A, in the promoter sequence of the BMPR2 gene was identified in one patient with FPAH, and no exonic mutations were detected in the proband. This mutation abolished a potential specificity protein 3 (sp3) transcription factor-binding site, and a dual luciferase assay showed that the promoter carrying the -669A allele had significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared with -669G allele. Of the other 19 patients, three novel heterozygous exonic mutations were identified: a frame shift mutation with deletion of TG at the nucleotide position 608-609 in exon 5 (Leu203fsX15), a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 292 in exon 3 (Glu98X) and a missense single nucleotide substitution in exon 12 (Ser863Asn).",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess whether polymorphisms in the promoter region of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2)gene can confer susceptibility to stroke risk. Methods:Distribution of frequencies of polymorphism -604T/C was determined in a multi-center case-control study,which comprised of 1849 patients with stroke (812 cerebral atherothrombosis,530 lacunar infarction,and 507 intracerebral hemorrhage)and 1798 controls. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the association with stroke risk. The effect of -604T/C on VEGFR-2 promoter activity was determined by luciferase reporter assays. Results:The frequencies of -604CC and TC genotypes were significantly lower in patients with thrombosis (TC 36.7%,CC 8.4%)than in controls (TC 41.8%,CC 10.3%)(P=0.004),and -604C allele was associated with decreased risk for atherothrombotic stroke (OR:0.78;95%CI:0.65-0.95;P=0.025). Moreover,-604C showed a significantly lower luciferase activity by 2.93 folds compared to the wild-type T allele(P<0.001). Conclusions:Polymorphism -604T/C in the promoter of VEGFR-2 gene contributes to a decreased risk for atherothrombotic stroke,probably through a down-regulated angiogenesis effect of VEGF in the progress of atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate whether telomere length shortening in blood leukocytes contributes to the risk of post-stroke prognosis in a large prospective cohort of patients with first onset stroke in Chinese population. Methods Patients with first onset stroke within 21 days of an acute event were recruited from December 2000 to December 2001 from seven clinical centers. Peripheral venous blood sample was collected at recruitment. The present study included 1662 stroke patients(725 cerebral atherothrombosis, 481 lacunar infarction, and 456 intracerebral hemorrhage). Relative telomere length in blood leukocytes was measured by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-based technique. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between telomere length and post-stroke all-cause death or cardio-cerebrovascular death.Results Stroke patients were prospectively followed up for median 4.5 years, and 312 deaths(of which 181 deaths caused by fatal stroke or coronary heart disease) were documented. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, dyslipidemia, fasting glucose, diabetes, family history of stroke, and hypertension, results showed that atherothrombotic stroke patients with shorter telomeres had 69% increased risk(adjusted relative risk[adj.RR]1.69, 95% confidence interval[CI]1.07\uff5e2.67; P=0.02) for post-stroke all-cause death, and 2.57-fold risk for cardio-cerebrovascular death(adj.RR 2.57, 95%CI1.24\uff5e5.31; P=0.01) in comparison of the lowest to highest tertile. In the follow-up patients with lacunar infarction or hemorrhagic stroke, shorter telomere length was not related to the risk of all-cause death(adj. RR 1.14, 95%CI0.59\uff5e2.18, P=0.35; adj.RR 0.92, 95%CI0.57\uff5e1.50, P=0.59, respectively), and cardio-cerebrovascular death(adj.RR 1.95, 95%CI0.76 \uff5e4.97, P=0.24; adj.RR 1.06, 95%CI0.59\uff5e1.89, P=0.56, respectively).Conclusion Shorter telomere length in blood leukocytes may serve as a potential marker for the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular death for patients with first onset cerebral atherothrombotic stroke.",

We hypothesized that putative functional genetic variation in the two genes encoding uPA and uPAR (PLAU and PLAUR respectively) might influence the susceptibility to MI. We genotyped rs4065 [3'-UTR (untranslated region) *141C>T) and rs2227564 (Pro141Leu) in the PLAU gene as well as rs344781 (-516T>C) in the PLAUR gene in 633 MI patients and 1237 gender- and age-matched control subjects. Our results showed that the T allele of rs4065 was significantly associated with an increased risk of MI, with an adjusted OR (odds ratio) of 1.38 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.07-1.78; P=0.012) under the dominant model, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.12-1.75; P=0.003) under the additive model and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.15-5.41; P=0.02) under the recessive model. The findings were then replicated in another independent case-control study including 545 MI patients and 597 control subjects. In conclusion, our results suggest that rs4065 might be a previously unknown genetic risk factor for MI in the Chinese Han population.",

        "abstract": "The role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in hypertension has been clarified, but recent studies show that aging-associated arterial changes and those with hypertension as well as atherosclerosis may have some common pathogenesis. This study aimed to clarify the effects of Ang II on endothelial senescence by establishing a replicative senescence model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. The population-doubling level (PDL) was calculated, PDL5 and PDL25 respectively referred to cells cultured for 2\u202fdays and 30\u202fdays. Compared with Ang II-treated young PDL5 cells, chronic stimulation of Ang II significantly promoted the senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and expression of senescence-related genes p16 and p21, slowed down cell growth rate, and decreased expression of longevity-related genes sirtuin1 as well as telomerase activity in senescent PDL25 cells (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Moreover, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules were up-regulated in Ang II-treated PDL25 cells (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Ang II-induced senescent progression and inflammation were attenuated by angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan. In young PDL5 cells, Ang II promoted the endothelial viability including cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and cell adhesion to monocytes; however, chronic stimulation of Ang II suppressed the cell viability, promoted cell adhesion and apoptosis in senescent PDL25 cells, which could be ameliorated by short-term valsartan, but long-term valsartan had no effects. In addition, Ang II-induced senescent features could be partly recovered if Ang II was stopped at PDL20. These findings suggested that chronic stimulation of Ang II can accelerate the endothelial senescence process which is implicated in aging-related atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "The clinical outcomes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are largely unpredictable. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and its prognostic implications in Chinese patients with HCM.From 1999 to 2011, 654 unrelated HCM patients were consecutively recruited at Fuwai Hospital. Medical history, including electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data, was analyzed.AF was documented in 158 patients (24%). During follow-up of 4.2 \u00b1 2.8 years, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the presence of AF was associated with an increased risk for all-cause death (p = 0.001), cardiovascular death (p < 0.001), severe heart failure (p < 0.001) and ischemic stroke (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified AF as an independent predictor of stroke-related death (HR 6.71, 95% CI 1.23-38.58, p = 0.03), advanced heart failure (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04-3.22, p = 0.04) and ischemic stroke (HR 9.98, 95% CI 4.06-24.53, p < 0.001). Furthermore, enlarged left atrial diameter was positively related to all-cause death (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, p < 0.001), cardiovascular death (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.20, p < 0.001) and development of advanced heart failure (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, p = 0.01).AF predicts poor outcomes for patients with HCM. Left atrial dilation is also related to an adverse prognosis and provides additional prognostic information.",

        "abstract": "The development of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is heterogeneous even in the presence of similar risk factors. Our aim was to determine whether inter-individual differences in leukocyte telomere length contribute to the susceptibility of PAD.A total of 485 patients with PAD (defined by the ankle-brachial index) and 970 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited from seven rural communities in Henan Province in China. The relative leukocyte telomere length was determined by a quantitative PCR-based method. Two common promoter variants of the hTERT gene were genotyped to assess their effects on telomere length and the risk of PAD. In vivo luciferase assay was performed to study the transcriptional activity.After adjustment for vascular risk factors and genetic variants in the hTERT gene, individuals in the lowest and middle tertiles of telomere length had a significantly higher risk of PAD than did those in the highest tertile (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.49 in the middle tertile; 3.15, 95%CI 2.31-4.29 in the lowest tertile). Haplotype analysis using the 2 variants (rs2735940 and rs2853669) showed that subjects with the at-risk C-C haplotype had shorter telomere length than those individuals with the T-T haplotype and consistently had 1.30-fold (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.06-1.58; P=0.005) increased risk for PAD. The C-C haplotype had 43% lowered transcription activity of hTERT promoter (P<0.001).The associations between the functional haplotype of hTERT gene and telomere length and the risk of atherosclerotic PAD suggested that mean leukocyte telomere length may independently serve as a potential predictor of PAD.",

        "abstract": "Although extensive research has characterized intricate genetic programs in heart system, the information generated is highly fragmented. Here we have developed a new database called CardioSignal, which was designed for integration of regulatory information on the transcriptional regulation involved in heart development and cardiac hypertrophy.Data about sequences, positions and functional annotation of transcription binding sites, cis-regulatory modules as well as promoters were collected from scientific literature. Genes involved in both processes were also manually gathered, particularly those preferentially expressed in the heart. Data was stored in MySQL database and Perl was used as the server-side programming language.Currently, CardioSignal contains 677 cardiac genes from twenty species. Among them are 128 cardiac transcription factors. Of the approximately 179 individual promoters from six species, the database also documented 247 experimentally verified binding sites and 64 cis-regulatory modules. CardioSignal may be searched for the promoter of a specific gene by specifying a gene name, Entrez geneID, swissProt accession number and so on. Downstream targets of transcriptional factors and cardiac regulatory modules can also be retrieved through a user-friendly web interface. Also available is experimental supporting evidence. Computational analysis tools were implemented for on-the-fly motif finding and comparative genomic analysis respectively.CardioSignal offers a unique resource as it contains simultaneously the promoter collected while correlating the information of transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory modules from heart system. We are hopeful that its implementation will contribute toward the elucidation of the complex processes in cardiac development and hypertrophy.",

Orthostatic hypertension was defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more and orthostatic hypotension as a drop in blood pressure of 20/10 mmHg or more within three minutes of assumption of upright posture.Female and male patients had similar rates of orthostatic hypertension (16.5% vs 15.3%) and hypotension (22.5% vs 23.8%). No significant differences were detected in the minor allele frequency of ACE2 rs2106809, rs2285666, or ACE I/D in either female or male patients with orthostatic hypertension (15.1%, 22.7%, 19.6%, respectively), hypotension (13.8%, 25%, 16.5%), or normal orthostatic blood pressure response (14.4%, 21.9%, 15.8%) in additive, dominant or recessive models after adjustment for confounders (all P>0.05). The orthostatic changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also comparable among patients carrying different genotypes. Similar results were observed in normotensive subjects.These data provide no support for the involvement of ACE or ACE2 in the genetic predisposition to orthostatic hypotension or hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Previous case-control studies have suggested that the variations of the oxidized-lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1) gene (G501C, 3'-UTR-C188T) are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, other studies have not confirmed this relationship. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between OLR1 variations and CAD.We conducted a meta-analysis. Databases, including PubMed, EMbase, Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database (CBM), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were searched to obtain genetic association studies. Data were extracted by two authors, and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI were calculated.The meta-analysis included 8 studies with 4,963 cases and 14,864 controls for 3'-UTR-C188T and 9 studies with 5,660 cases and 15,405 controls for G501C. The pooled OR for 3'-UTR-188T was 1.29 (95% CI 1.05-1.58, p = 0.02) compared to the C allele in the dominant model, and it was 1.38 (95% CI 1.09-1.74, p = 0.007) in the recessive model. The pooled OR for 501C was 0.79 (95% CI 0.57-1.10, p = 0.16) compared to the G allele in the dominant model, and it was 0.86 (95% CI 0.71-1.04, p = 0.12) in the recessive model. No publication bias was found in the present meta-analysis.The synthesis of available evidence supports that OLR1 3'-UTR-188T increases the susceptibility to CAD. However, G501C is not associated with CAD.",

        "abstract": "Plasma homocysteine concentrations have been associated with the risk of stroke, but its relevance to secondary vascular events and mortality after stroke remains unclear because of inconsistent results from clinical trials. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether plasma homocysteine levels and the MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) variant C677T contributed to the risk of stroke recurrence and all-cause mortality in a large prospective cohort of stroke patients in a Chinese population. A total of 1823 stroke patients (age, 35-74 years) were recruited during 2000-2001 and prospectively followed-up for a median of 4.5 years. During the follow-up, 347 recurrent strokes and 323 deaths from all-causes were documented. After adjustment for age, gender and other cardiovascular risk factors, a high homocysteine concentration was associated with an increased risk of 1.74-fold for stroke recurrence {RR (relative risk), 1.74 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.3-2.3]; P<0.0001} and 1.75-fold for all-cause mortality [RR, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.3-2.4); P<0.0001] when highest and lowest categories were compared. Spline regression analyses revealed a threshold level of homocysteine for stroke recurrence. By dichotomizing homocysteine concentrations, the RRs were 1.31 (95% CI, 1.10-1.61; P=0.016) for stroke recurrence and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.15-1.88; P<0.0001) for all-cause mortality in patients with homocysteine levels > or =16 micromol/l relative to those with levels <16 micromol/l. The association of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations with all-cause mortality was mainly due to an increased risk of cardiovascular deaths. No significant association was found between MTHFR C677T and stroke recurrence or mortality. In conclusion, our findings suggest that elevated homocysteine concentrations can predict the risk of stroke recurrence and mortality in patients with stroke.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide)/NPRA (type A natriuretic peptide receptor) system modulates ventricular remodelling and cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension in Western populations. In the present study, we tested for any association between two SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the ANP gene (one in the promoter and one exonic) with cardiac hypertrophy. We tested the hypothesis in 2118 hypertensive patients, including 945 with LVH [LV (left ventricular) hypertrophy] and 1173 without LVH, as well as 816 healthy control subjects. All subjects were genotyped for the -A2843G and A188G polymorphisms. We found that the GG genotype at position -2843 conferred a 2.2-fold risk for LVH compared with the AA or AG genotypes, including septal wall thickness (11.8+/-1.4 mm for GG compared with 10.9+/-1.4 and 10.7+/-1.3 mm for AA and AG respectively; P<0.01), posterior wall thickness (11.8+/-2.8 mm for GG compared with 10.6+/-1.2 and 10.6+/-1.4 mm for AA and AG respectively; P<0.01), LV mass index (62.7+/-13.6 g/m(2.7) for GG compared with 57.9+/-8.6 and 57.8+/-8.4 g/m(2.7) for AA and AG respectively; P<0.05) and relative wall thickness (50.7+/-10.8% for GG compared with 44.3+/-7.3 and 43.5+/-6.8% for AA and AG respectively; P<0.05). Plasma levels of ANP were significantly lower in the hypertensive patients with LVH carrying the GG genotypes compared with those carrying the AA or AG genotypes (P<0.01). No association of GG genotype with echocardiographic variables and plasma ANP levels was identified in hypertensive patients without LVH and in control subjects (P>0.05). No significant association between the A188G genotype and echocardiographic variables was found in either hypertensive patients or controls (P>0.05). In conclusion, our findings indicate that the -A2843G polymorphism in the ANP gene promoter might be a genetic risk factor for the development of LVH in patients with hypertension.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between telomere length and stroke was inconsistent mostly due to different pathogenesis of subtypes, environment and genetics. We aimed to assess whether leukocyte telomere contributes to stroke in Southern Chinese by investigating a case-control study comprising 543 cases (224 atherothrombotic stroke, 94 hemorrhagic stroke and 225 lacunar infraction) and 616 controls and replicated the investigation in an independent study comprising 773 cases and 875 controls with the same diagnostic criteria. Telomere was inversely correlated with increasing age in controls (correlation coefficient \u03b3\u2009=\u2009-0.28, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and in cases with atherothrombotic stroke (\u03b3\u2009=\u2009-0.17, P\u2009=\u20090.012). Individuals within the lowest tertile of telomere showed a higher risk for atherothrombotic stroke [odds ratio 2.33, 95% confidence (CI) 1.42-3.83; P\u2009=\u20090.003], whereas had a lower presence of lacunar infarction (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.81; P\u2009=\u20090.007). Similar results were obtained in the second replication study. A further meta-analysis showed a 12% increased pooled risk of ischemic stroke (95% CI 1.04-1.18) in relation to shorter telomere, but this association was stronger in the retrospective studies and in Asians when stratified by study design and ethnicity. Our data provided the first evidence that in Southern Chinese stroke population, leukocyte telomere is independently associated with atherothrombotic stroke and lacunar infarction.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess the relationship of the variants in promoter region of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEG-FR -2)gene in susceptibility to the risk of stroke recurrence. Methods:A total of 1849 stroke patients were prospectively followed up from(0.1\uff5e6.0)years for a median of 4.5 years, Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine the association between genotypes and stroke recurrence after adjustment of age,sex,and other cardiovascular risk factors.The correlation of variants with carotid artery intima-media thickness(IMT)was examined in 1123 healthy participants as the control study. Results:There were 355 recurrent stroke patients were documented.The recurrence occurred in 17.1%of carriers with CC and TC genotypes(159/929),andin21.3%of carriers with-604 TT genotype(196/920).The variant-604 C allele was associated with the reduced risk for stroke recurrence(RR 0.71,95%CI 0.58 to 0.89;P=0.002)compared with the TT genotype,and the protective effect was stronger in patients with atherosclerotic stroke.In addition,the presence of-604 C allele was correlated with the lower carotid artery IMT(P<0.001). Conclusion:Promoter variant-604T/C in VEGFR-2 gene contributed to a reduced risk for stroke recurrence,especially for atherosclerotic stroke.This might be through a down-regulated angiogenesis of VEGF signaling in the progress of atherosclerosis.",

The gene shares high similarity to the gene encoding F-actin binding protein nexilin, so named as NELIN. A clone of 2737bp contains open reading frame of 1344bp extending from 412 to 1755. NELIN was expressed primarily in the heart and skeletal muscle among eight tested normal tissues. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that NELIN product was associated with F-actin. Stable transfection of NELIN into HeLa cells increased the cell migration by 2.17-fold and the adhesion by 1.67-fold, respectively, compared to cells with the empty vector (P<0.05).

        "abstract": "Inter-individual differences in biological aging could affect susceptibility to stroke. To date, the relationship between stroke and telomere shortening remain inconclusive; and sparse data are available for haemorrhagic stroke. A Chinese case-control study was conducted, comprising 1756 cases (767 atherothrombosis, 503 lacunar infarction and 486 haemorrhagic strokes) and 1801 controls. Stroke patients were prospectively followed up for a median of 4.5 (range, 0.1-6.0) years. Individuals with shorter telomere length had a higher presence of atherothrombotic stroke {multivariate OR (odds ratio) 1.37 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.06-1.77]; P=0.015} or haemorrhagic stroke [multivariate OR 1.48 (95% CI, 1.08-2.02); P=0.016] in comparison of the lowest to highest tertile of telomere length. Particularly, in subjects with a family history of stroke, there was a significant 2.55-fold increased presence of atherothrombotic stroke (95% CI, 1.87-3.48; Ptrend<0.0001) and a 2.33-fold increased presence of haemorrhagic stroke (95% CI, 1.62-3.36; Ptrend<0.0001). During the follow-up, 338 recurrent strokes and 312 deaths (181 from stroke or coronary heart disease and 131 from other causes) were documented. Associations with stroke recurrence were not observed in the follow-up patients, whereas atherothrombotic stroke cases with shorter telomeres had 69% increased risk of post-stroke death [relative risk, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.07-2.67); P=0.02]. Finally, we compared telomere lengths in 12 paired samples of circulating leucocytes and carotid atherosclerotic plaques from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy; there was a positive correlation between vessel wall tissue and leucocyte telomere length. In conclusion, shorter telomere length may serve as a potential marker for the presence of atherothrombotic and haemorrhagic stroke and for the risk of post-stroke death.",

        "title": "Apolipoprotein E genotype, cardiovascular biomarkers and risk of stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 015 stroke cases and pooled analysis of primary biomarker data from up to 60 883 individuals",
        "abstract": "Background: At the APOE gene, encoding apolipoprotein E, genotypes of the \u03b52/\u03b53/ \u03b54 alleles associated with higher LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are also associated with higher coronary risk. However, the association of APOE genotype with other cardiovascular biomarkers and risk of ischaemic stroke is less clear. We evaluated the association of APOE genotype with risk of ischaemic stroke and assessed whether the observed effect was consistent with the effects of APOE genotype on LDL-C or other lipids and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published and unpublished studies reporting on APOE genotype and ischaemic stroke. We pooled 41 studies (with a total of 9027 cases and 61 730 controls) using a Bayesian meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for ischaemic stroke with APOE genotype. To better evaluate potential mechanisms for any observed effect, we also conducted a pooled analysis of primary data using 16 studies (up to 60 883 individuals) of European ancestry. We evaluated the association of APOE genotype with lipids, other circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT). Results: The ORs for association of APOE genotypes with ischaemic stroke were: 1.09 (95% credible intervals (CrI): 0.84-1.43) for \u03b52/\u03b52; 0.85 (95% CrI: 0.78-0.92) for \u03b52/\u03b53; 1.05 (95% CrI: 0.89-1.24) for \u03b52/\u03b54; 1.05 (95% CrI: 0.99-1.12) for \u03b53/\u03b54; and 1.12 (95% CrI: 0.94-1.33) for \u03b54/\u03b54 using the \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype as the reference group. A regression analysis that investigated the effect of LDL-C (using APOE as the instrument) on ischaemic stroke showed a positive doseresponse association with an OR of 1.33 (95% CrI: 1.17, 1.52) per 1 mmol/l increase in LDL-C. In the separate pooled analysis, APOE genotype was linearly and positively associated with levels of LDL-C (P-trend: 2\u00d710-152), apolipoprotein B (P-trend: 8.7\u00d710-o6) and C-IMT (P-trend: 0.001), and negatively and linearly associated with apolipoprotein E (P-trend: 6\u00d710-26) and HDL-C (P-trend: 1.6\u00d710-12). Associations with lipoprotein(a), C-reactive protein and triglycerides were non-linear. Conclusions: In people of European ancestry, APOE genotype showed a positive dose-response association with LDL-C, C-IMT and ischaemic stroke. However, the association of APOE \u03b52/\u03b52 genotype with ischaemic stroke requires further investigation. This cross-domain concordance supports a causal role of LDL-C on ischaemic stroke. \u00a9 The Author 2013. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess the gene polymorphisms and concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the risk for stoke. Method:Total 1 849 patients with stroke (43.9 % cerebral atherothrombosis, 28.7 % lacunar infarction, and 27.4 % intracerebral hemorrhage) and 1 798 controls were recruited from 7 centers. Three polymorphisms of -460T/C, -116G/A, and +405G/C in the VEGF gene were genotyped by PCR-RFLP assays. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to exclude the influence of conventional vascular risk factors on the risk of stroke. VEGF plasma level was measured by ELISA. Result:Plasma VEGF levels were significantly higher in cases than in controls [291\u00b161.9] versus [225 \u00b156.3]ng/L, P<0.01). However, no significant correlation was found between the tested VEGF polymorphisms and VEGF levels (-460T/C: r=-0.119,P=0.37;-116G/A: r=0.173,P=0.19;+405G/C: r=0.144,P=0.27; respectively). All VEGF markers were not associated with stroke after adjustment for established vascular risk factors. Conclusion:These data suggested that elevated levels of plasma VEGF might play a role in the development of stroke, while polymorphisms in the 5'-regulatory region of VEGF gene did not contribute to stroke.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence and clinical significance of orthostatic hypertension (OHT) remain largely undetermined in hypertensive patients. This study investigated the association of OHT and orthostatic hypotension (OH) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and target organ damage (TOD) in hypertensive patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 4,711 hypertensives and 826 normotensives, aged 40-75 years. OHT was defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of > or =20 mm Hg, and OH was defined as either a reduction in SBP of at least 20 mm Hg or a reduction in diastolic BP (DBP) of at least 10 mm Hg during the first 3 min after standing.Hypertension was only independently associated with a risk of OHT. After controlling for age, sex, and other confounders, OH was associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) (odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.89, P < 0.01), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.93, P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.12-2.61, P < 0.01), and stroke (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.19-2.34, P < 0.01), but OHT was only associated with PAD (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.81, P < 0.05) and stroke (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.27-2.26, P < 0.01). The adjusted OR for PAD, predicted by the quintiles of the orthostatic SBP changes, showed a J-shaped relationship in untreated hypertensive patients, as was also the case for LVH in hypertensive women.OH is associated with CV risk; the associations of OHT with TOD and stroke in hypertensive patients still need to be confirmed in prospective studies.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is a polygenic or multifactorial disease, and each single susceptibility gene has modest effects. We hypothesize that combined effects of multiple genes might confer a higher stroke risk than a single susceptibility gene. To test our hypothesis we initially recruited 2000 stroke patients (44.3% thrombosis, 28.3% lacunar infarction and 27.4% intracerebral hemorrhage) and 2000 controls, and examined 6 polymorphisms in 5 candidate genes for stroke. Plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] level was defined as a categorical variable and also included. Interactions between genetic risk factors were detected by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method and further evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analyses. A significant combined effect on stroke due to the C677T polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), the T2354A polymorphism of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (ALOX5AP), and Lp(a) level, was detected using the MDR method. Furthermore, the combination of MTHFR 677TT, ALOX5AP 2354AA and Lp(a) elevation (Lp(a) concentration > or = 30 mg/dL) was found to be strongly associated with thrombotic stroke in males (OR, 10.419; 95%CI, 2.602 to 41.749; P= 0.001) using the multivariate logistic regression model. In conclusion, our results show that a combination of genetic risk factors can confer a higher risk for stroke than a single risk factor, indicating that people with multiple genetic risk factors have a higher risk of stroke and should be targets for prevention of this disease.",

        "abstract": "It has been reported that the variants of the PDE4D (phosphodiesterase 4D) gene are associated with stroke, especially with the combination of cardio-embolic and carotid stroke in the Icelandic population, but it is still very controversial as to whether PDE4D is a susceptible gene for stroke in other populations. In the present study, we tested whether the PDE4D gene variation also confers stroke risk in a Chinese population. Our hypothesis was tested in a case-control study of a Chinese population comprising 639 stroke patients (including 253 with cerebral thrombosis, 171 with lacunar infarction and 215 with intracerebral haemorrhage) and 887 healthy controls. Three SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) (rs966221, rs456009 and rs2910829) in PDE4D were chosen based on the significant association with stroke reported previously in a Western population, and these were genotyped using PCR/RFLP (restriction-fragment-length polymorphism) and confirmed by sequencing. We found that only SNP83 (rs966221) was associated with stroke. Allele C of rs966221 is a risk allele, conferring an increased risk for atherothrombotic strokes [OR (odds ratio), 1.51; 95% CI (confidence interval), 1.09-2.10] independent of conventional risk factors. Haplotype analysis confirmed that haplotype G-C-C was associated with increased risk for atherothrombotic stroke (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.300-2.491). Our findings support that SNP83 of PDE4D is a genetic risk factor for atherothrombotic strokes in a Chinese population.",

Many studies have searched the association between variants of the MCP-1 gene or CCR2 gene and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but the results are inconsistent.We conducted a meta-analysis of 20 publications including 24 studies on 2 genetic variants [A-2518G in the MCP-1 and V64I in the CCR2] published before January 2011, including a total of 9844 patients with CAD and 11,821 controls. Publication bias and heterogeneity among studies were explored.In a combined analysis, the pooled OR for CAD of the -2518G allele was 1.42 (95%CI: 1.06-1.92) compared to wild-type A allele under a recessive model in Caucasian group, but there is an indication of publication bias and heterogeneity among the 9 studies. When the analyses were restricted to 2 large studies (n\u2265500 cases), the pooled OR was 1.08 (95%CI: 0.85-1.37). Our analyses detected a possibility of publication bias with an overestimate of the true association by smaller studies. A meta-analysis of studies on the CCR2 V64I variant showed no significant association with CAD, the pooled OR of 64I was 1.27 (95%CI: 0.81-1.99) in recessive model and 1.06 (95%CI: 0.95-1.19) in dominant model, respectively.The results indicate that MCP-1-2518G allele had probably increased risk of CAD in Caucasian but this is likely to be due to publication bias and insufficient sample size. The CCR2 V64I has not been found any association with CAD.",

        "abstract": "Objective Telomere length is determined by both genetic and environmental factors,with estimated heritability between 35% and 80%.Human telomerase reverse transcriptase(hTERT) is the rate-limiting catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme.The hTERT expression is strictly regulated at the transcription machinery,and thus it may be speculated that sequence changes in the hTERT promoter region interfere with the activation/depression of hTERT gene.To date,there is limited data available concerning the influence of Ets binding site mutation or polymorphism on hTERT expression.Methods Two single nucleotide polymorphisms,rs2735940(-1327T/C) and rs2853669(-190T/C),were genotyped by the PCR-restriction fragmental length polymorphism method.To determine whether different haplotypes of the 2 variants(rs2735940 and rs2853669) affects the transcription activity of hTERT gene,a series of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids carrying rs2735940T-or C-and rs2853669T-or C-sequence were constructed.We further constructed plasmids for expression of pcDNA3.1-Ets2 and pcDNA3.1-c-Myc.Hela cells were co-transfected with these two kinds of plasmids.The hTERT gene promoter activities were assessed by measuring relative luciferase activity.Results The results showed that hTERT promoter haplotype carrying the at-risk rs2853669C allele had significantly lower luciferase activity than did that with the wild-type T-T haplotype,with 31% decrease for the T-C haplotype and 43% decrease for the C-C haplotype(P<0.001),respectively.The transcriptional factors Ets2 and c-Myc had a combined effect by enhancing the promoter activity of hTERT gene(P<0.001).Conclusion Sequence containing the hTERT promoter haplotype C-C(rs2735940 and rs2853669) has a lower transcription activity,via interfering with the binding efficiency with transcription factors Ets2 and c-Myc.",

This investigation sought to evaluate the impact of myocardial bridging on prognosis of patients with HCM.A total of 298 adult patients (73% male, mean age, 53 \u00b1 12 years) with HCM were retrospectively enrolled at Fuwai Hospital from 1999 to 2011. Myocardial bridging was evaluated by coronary angiography. Follow-up data were collected by telephone interviews and mailed questionnaires.Thirty-four (11%, 34/298) patients were determined with myocardial bridging and the middle of left anterior descending artery was the most frequently involved segment (77%, 26/34). Patients with myocardial bridging were younger than those without bridging (48 \u00b1 9 versus 54 \u00b1 12 years, P = 0.001).

        "abstract": "Damage precursors in the 3\u03c9 (351 nm) mirror for a high-power laser system are investigated as well as the relevant damage mechanisms. The precursors are classified into two ensembles according to the different laser resistance and damage features. The former is nano-absorbing precursors, which are sensitive to the standing wave electric field and vulnerable to the laser irradiation. The latter is submicrometer nodular defects, which have higher laser resistance and are sensitive to the adhesion strength between the fluoride coatings and oxide coatings. The damage due to nano-absorbing precursors is efficiently suppressed with the double stack design that screens the electric field in the oxides. Currently, the nodular seed is major originating from the Al2O3/SiO2 stack. Even for the same defect type and mirror, the final damage features are dependent on the local mechanical properties at the irradiation location. The investigations of the damage mechanisms provide a direction to further improve the laser-induced damage threshold of the 3\u03c9 mirror.",

        "abstract": "The laser damage resistance of the coatings for high-power laser systems depends greatly on the surface quality of the substrate. In our work, experimental approaches were employed to understand the interface coupling effect of the substrate surface and coatings on the laser resistance of the coatings. A 1064\u00a0nm anti-reflection (AR) coating was deposited by an e-beam coater onto fused silica with and without micro-scale pits (structural defects). The micro-scale pits were precisely fabricated by femtosecond laser processing to prevent the emergence of subsurface cracks. Different deposition temperatures were characterized in order to verify the intensity of the interface coupling effect of the substrate and coating layers. Our experimental results indicate that impurities that are introduced in the finishing process, shifted to the substrate surface, and aggregated during the heating process, play a much more crucial role than structural defects (length: \u223c7\u2009\u2009\u03bcm; width: \u223c3\u2009\u2009\u03bcm; depth: \u223c0.8\u2009\u2009\u03bcm) in the laser-induced damage process. By effectively reducing the intensity of the interface coupling effect, the e-beam AR coatings, whose laser-induced damage resistance was closed to the bare substrate, was prepared. ",

The LIDT of the active mirror whose substrate is manually scrubbed is lower than that of one whose substrate is ultrasonically cleaned. Analysis shows that the absorbing surface defects on the manually scrubbed Nd:glass surface are responsible for the lower LIDT of the active mirror prepared via manual scrubbing, while the subsurface defects in the ultrasonically cleaned Nd:glass substrate are the main reason for the damage of the active mirror prepared via ultrasonic cleaning. The strong standing-wave electric field near the interface between the coating and the Nd:glass substrate is another factor affecting the damage of the active mirror.",

The highest lactic acid yield from glucose with Zn/Ni/ activated carbon reach up to about 55%.CONCLUSIONZn may inhibit the decomposition of lactic acid mainly, but also restrain the oxidation of Ni when Zn and Ni existed simultaneously. Ni plays a catalytic role and trace amounts of Ni2+ dissolved during the reaction improve the lactic acid yield. Activated carbon increases the contact area of the reactants. In addition, response surface methodology design (RSMD) results indicate that there are positive interactions between each of the added components, which contribute to the significantly improved yield of lactic yield from glucose.",

They are exposed to nanosecond 1064 nm laser incident from the Nd:glass. The laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDTs) of the coated sides are lower than those of the uncoated sides. The LIDT of the active mirror whose substrate is manually scrubbed is lower than that of one whose substrate is ultrasonically cleaned. Analysis shows that the absorbing surface defects on the manually scrubbed Nd:glass surface are responsible for the lower LIDT of the active mirror prepared via manual scrubbing, while the subsurface defects in the ultrasonically cleaned Nd:glass substrate are the main reason for the damage of the active mirror prepared via ultrasonic cleaning. The strong standing-wave electric field near the interface between the coating and the Nd:glass substrate is another factor affecting the damage of the active mirror.",

However, the transmittance in the ultraviolet is limited by the scattering from the etched structures. A graded refractive index model ignoring the scattering in the visible range is applied to extract the etched profile. Then the Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm is used to reconstruct the random antireflective structures with the extracted profile. Bidirectional scattering distribution for the reconstructed structures is simulated with the finite-difference time-domain method, which indicates the importance of transmissive scattering the scattering directivity. The scattering directivity is explained well with an effective grating model. The period of the effective grating can guide the prepared technique in the ultraviolet.",

It was found that samples with hierarchical structures and highly developed micro\u2013mesoporous system could be obtained owing to the pre-induced highly dispersed potassium species by ion exchange, which served as an efficient activation agent, this represents an important improvement as compared with the normally reported KOH activation protocol in terms of lowering the usage of the corrosive KOH, and thus the sustainability of the obtained material. The optimized sample, R-K-700, showed the highest CO 2  and phenol uptake of 13.6\u00a0wt.% and 167.3\u00a0mg/g, respectively, and more importantly, samples with an ordered spherical form and similar adsorption performance to the powdered sample can be easily fabricated, making the current carbons and preparation methodology a great promise for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Coking is one of the main obstacles to the application of Ni-based catalysts for CO 2  (dry) reforming of methane (DRM). In this work, the anti-coking behaviors of a highly stable Ni-CaO-ZrO 2  nanocomposite catalyst were systemically studied by structure characterizations, activity tests and thermodynamic calculations under different temperature. The results revealed that the structures and anti-coking properties of the nanocomposite catalyst primarily depended on reaction temperature. The in-situ XRD, H 2  chemisorption and TEM analysis of the catalysts indicated that only slightly sintering of Ni and ZrO 2  took place at a lower reduction and reaction temperature (750\u00a0\u00b0C). At a higher reduction and reaction temperature (850\u00a0\u00b0C), severe sintering of ZrO 2  and Ni was observed. However, it is interesting to find that the formed large nickel particles were almost covered by ZrO 2  support after the high temperature reduction and only exposed very small nickel size. Coking analysis revealed that although a small Ni size could kinetically inhibit the carbon formation to some extent, a relatively higher amount of coking was formed at 750\u00a0\u00b0C due to the strong thermodynamic tendency for coking. At 850\u00a0\u00b0C, the amount of carbon deposition was much lower than that at 750\u00a0\u00b0C, which was mainly attributed to the unfavorable coking thermodynamics and the small exposed size of Ni. Therefore, high reaction temperature resulted in both the thermodynamic and kinetic coking inhibition behaviors and contributed to the superior anti-coking performance of the nanocomposite catalyst. It is our belief that the results obtained in this work could provide valuable implications for optimizing catalyst structure and reaction condition to achieve coking-free DRM catalysts and processes.",

AlF 3  single-layer coatings were deposited; optical property, surface morphology and roughness, and composition were characterized in different periods. Owing to aging effect, refractive index and extinction coefficient increased; larger and larger roughness caused more and more scattering loss, which was in the same order with absorption at 193.4\u00a0nm and part of optical loss; from composition analysis, proportional substitution of AlF 3  by alumina may account for changes in refractive index as well as absorption.",

        "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effect of reduced-glutathione on preventing erectile dysfunction in diabetic rats. Methods Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were induced for diabetes by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, then randomly divided into DM group and DM+GSH group. The rats in DM+GSH group were treated with GSH at a dosage of 200mg/kg through a intramuscular injection every day. Ten weeks later the erectile function of all these rats were evaluated,and their penises harvested. The GSH, NOS and MDA level in corpus cavernosum were measured;and TUNEL assay was used to analyse the penile cells for apoptosis. Results The diabetic rat model was successfully established. The erectile function was much better in normal control group(group C, 100%)and DM+GSH group(62.5%) than DM group (20%), P<0.05. The glutathione level in DM group was significantly decreased (35.03\u00b112.29)mg/g prot, compared to group C (61.47\u00b18.65)mg/g prot and DM+GSH group (75.83\u00b115.62)mg/g prot, P<0.05. The NOS level was approximately equal in DM+GSH group(133.9\u00b131.9)U/mg prot and group C (142.2\u00b131.2)U/mg prot, both much higher than in DM group (58.4\u00b118.9)U/mg prot, P<0.05. The malondialdehyde content in corpus cavernosum was markedly increased in DM group (3.71\u00b10.62)nmol/mg prot, compared to group C (2.08\u00b10.34)nmol/mg prot and DM+GSH group(2.44\u00b10.28)nmol/mg prot, P<0.05. TUNEL showed significantly differences in apoptosis in these groups, and the apoptosis rate in DM group, DM+GSH group and group C were (22.6\u00b13.6)%, (10.8\u00b11.7)% and (7.2\u00b12.1)%, respectively. Conclusion The reduced-glutathione has the effect of antioxidation on diabetic rats\u2019 penis tissues,which can decrease the apoptosis of corpus cavernosum cells, and may play some role in delaying the onset of diabetic erectile dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effect of inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antisense oligonucleotides (ASODN) on human bladder carcinoma in nude mice mediated by ultrasound microbubble. Methods: Twenty-four mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (each n=6) when transplantation tumor was established, and different materials were injected into the mice through caudal veins: Circled digit oneUM+ASODN group: mixture of microbubble and VEGF ASODN plus ultrasound irradiation of local tumor; Circled digit twoliposome + ASODN group: mixture of liposome and VEGF-ASODN; Circled digit threeUM group: microbubble plus local irradiation with the same condition; and Circled digit fourcontrol group: normal saline. The treatment was performed every 3 d with total 5 times. The volume change of mouse subcutane tumors was observed. The expression of VEGF, CD34 and Ki67 with immunohistochemistry dyeing were evaluated, and the microvessel density (MVD) and cell proliferation index were calculated. TUNEL assay was used to analyze the apoptosis of tumor cells. Results: The growth speed of nude mice tumor in UM+ASODN group was obviously slower than that in control group; the expression of VEGF and the MVD in UM+ASODN group was lower than that in control group (P<.0.05), while compared with control group, the apoptosis of tumor in UM+ASODN group increased (P< 0.01), but the proliferation of tumor in UM+ASODN group de creased (P< 0.05). Conclusion: VEGF antisense oligonucleotides mediated by ultrasound microbubbe can efficiently inhibit the growth of human bladder carcinoma in nude mice.",

Researchers consider Livin may become a new target for tumor therapy; however, the role of it in bladder cancer is still unclear. The purpose of this article is to investigate Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASODN) of Livin on treating bladder cancer cell and underlying mechanisms.Phosphorathioate modifying was used to synthesize antisense oligonucleotides targeting Livin, followed by transfection into human bladder cancer cell 5637. After transfection, Livin mRNA and protein level, cell proliferation and apoptosis changes, caspase3 level and its effect on human bladder cancer transplantable tumor in nude mice were measured.results showed Livin ASODN effectively inhibited Livin expression and tumor cell proliferation, and these effects probably through enhanced caspase3 activity and apoptosis of tumor cells. In nude mice transplantable tumor model, Livin expressions were inhibited meanwhile caspase3 expression was increased. Tumor growth slowed down and apoptosis was enhanced.Our data suggest that Livin plays an important role in inhibiting apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. Livin ASODN may promote cell apoptosis, inhibit bladder cancer growth, and become one of the methods of gene therapy for bladder cancer.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore the feasibility of improving the delivery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to cavernosum tissue for the treating rat diabetes-induced erectile dysfunction by using ultrasonic microbubble destruction. Methods: EPCs were derived from mouse bone marrow in vitro. Fifty-four SD rats were successfully induced into models of diabetes mellitus induced erectile dysfunction (DMED) and were randomly divided into 3 groups, i. e. control group, EPCs group and 1.0 W/cm 2 ultrasound + microbubbles + EPCs (US + MB + EPCs) group. All the rats were sacrificed 7 days after EPCs implantation. The number of penile erections and erection rate were induced by apomorphine (APO), and the vascular density of 3 groups was recorded after HE staining. EPCs expression was detected using immunohistochemistry, and VEGF protein was respectively detected with Western blot. Results: Penile erections, erection rate, vascular density and EPCs expression were the best in US + MB + EPCs group (P < 0.05). And the expression of VEGF protein in US + MB + EPCs group was higher than that in two other groups (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Combination of ultrasound microbubbles and EPCs can enhance the transfection efficiency and targeting of EPCs effectively, therefore improve the erectile function of DMED rats.

Methods Specific phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting livin were synthesized and then transfected into 786-O cells. The expressions of livin mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. Expression and location of livin protein were observed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Apoptosis rate of 786-O cells was investigated by flow cytometer. The activity of Caspase-3 was detected by colorimetric assay. Results After the transfection of ASODN, the expression of livin mRNA was decreased (P<0.01), the fluorescence signal of livin protein observed by CLSM was significantly decreased, the apoptosis rates detected by flow cytometry were significantly increased (P<0.01), and the caspase-3 activity was enhanced (P<0.01). Conclusion Livin ASODN could remarkably down-regulate the expression of livin gene in 786-O cells line and induce tumor cell apoptosis. These events are linked to the activation of caspase-3.",

Methods Pretesting of the integrity of sperm acrosomal integrity and DNA of 20 normal sperm samples were carried out as reference data. In total 60 varicocele patients with kidney yang deficiency collected from the Reproductive Center of our hospital from April 2008 to January 2011 were randomly divided into the treatment group (30 cases, given Shi Zi Er Xian Decoction) and control group (30 cases, given L-carnitine). The semen samples were collected 1 week before surgery and 3 months after surgery. All the treatments lasted for 3 months without stop. Three months later, the patients who did not respond well to the treatment (DFI\u226515 and acrosomal integrity<90%) underwent drug withdrawal for one week. Then, the treatment programs were exchanged, lasting for one course again. Results After one course of treatment, the sperm density, motility, DFI and acrosomal integrity of both groups were all improved. The sperm motility, DFI and acrosomal integrity of the treatment group were better than those of the control group (P<0.05), but the sperm density had no significant difference between them(P>0.05). After the treatment programs were exchanged, better effect was found in the group given the Shi Zi Er Xian Decoction than that in the control group(P<0.05). Conclusion The Shi Zi Er Xian Decoction is able to reduce sperm DFI in patients with kidney yang deficiency and improve acrosomal integrity.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the effects of a -1ipoic acid on the expression of cytoskeleton proteins in the oxidative stress-induced sertoli cells. Methods Primary rat sertoli cells were randomly divided into four groups including control group, LA(200\u03bcmol/L) group, H 2O 2(400 \u03bcmol/L) group and H 2O 2 plus LA pretreatment group. Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The activities of antioxidant enzymes were measured by enzyme activity detection kit. The expressions of vimentin and a-tubulin were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results Compared with those of the control group, cell viability was decreased, intracellular ROS was increased, activities of antioxidant enzymes were decreased and the expressions of vimentin and a-tubulin were downregulated in sertoli cells after the stimulation of H 2O 2(P<0.05). However, by LA pretreatment, cell viability was improved, activities of antioxidant enzymes were enhanced, intracellular ROS level was decreased, and the expressions of vimentin and \u03b1-tubulin were upregulated (P <0.05). Conclusion H 2O 2 might induce the expressions of vimentin and a-tubulin in sertoli cells and its cell survival rate. The protective role of LA might amend this damage by eliminating intracellular ROS, improving the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and upregulating the expressions of vimentin and \u03b1-tubulin.",

Methods Twenty-four SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: BPH group, UM+BPH group and the control group. After injected with albumin ultrasound contrast, the rats in UM+BPH group were treated with ultrasound irradiation by using the UGT 1025 type gene transfection instrument. The change of prostatic blood vessel and cellular membrane were observed under electron microscope. The prostatic index (PI) was calculated and the content of trypan blue per 100 mg prostatic tissue determined by using spectrophotometry. Results The weaker capillary basement membrane, leakage of red blood cells from capillary, epithelium becoming sparse and cavitations in the mitochondrium were observed in UM+BPH group. The PI were higher in BPH group (2.88\u00b10.03) and UM+BPH group (2.88\u00b10.02) than in the control group (1.57\u00b10.04) (P<0.05).

The 2 patients were mis diagnosed before operation. Their tumors consisted of irregular nests of small and round cells, with nuclear hyperchromatism and scant cytoplasm embedded in a plenty of fibrous connective tissues. The edge of the nest was clear, with different sizes and shapes. Immunohistochemically, the 2 patients were positive for CK or EMA, NSE, des and vim of the epithelium, nerve, muscle and interstitial. They died 9 months after operation.The tumor may occur in the abdomen, pelvic cavity and other sites, with different clinical manifestations. Routine examination should be replaced by immunohistochemical test for correct diagnosis of the tumor. Prognosis of most patients is not good.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To systematically review the effectiveness and safety of ureteroscopic lithotripsy combined with ntrap for upper urethral calculi. Methods:All randomized clinical trials and case-controlled studies of ntrap during ureteroscopic lithotripsy(URL)for upper urethral calculi were identified with PubMed,Cochrane Librily,Embase,WangFang and CNKI. Quality assessments of literatures and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Meta analysis was performed with Revman 5.0. Results:Two randomized trails and 2 case-controlled studies involving 682 patients were collected. Meta-analysis demonstrated that:ntrap group demonstrated a significant advantage over control group in terms of calculi clearance rate(OR=4.28,95%CI=2.51 to 7.28,P=0.000). Incidences of calculi migration and auxiliary lithotripsy were significantly lower in ntrap group than in control group(OR=0.09,95%CI= 0.01 to 0.62,P=0.01;OR=0.18,95%CI=0.05 to 0.67,P=0.010). There was no statistical difference in mean operation time between the two groups(WMD=-0.09,95%CI=-10.25 to 10.06,P=0.990). Conclusions:URL combined with ntrap for upper urethral calculi had higher calculi clearance rate,lower incidence of calculi migration and auxiliary lithotripsy than URL without ntrap.",

        "abstract": "Varicocele, a cause of male infertility, occurs in nearly 40% of infertile males. It has been postulated that varicoceles may cause sperm DNA damage. Sperm DNA integrity has been recognized as one of the important determinants of normal fertilization and embryo growth in natural and assisted conception. Eighty-three human studies were identified after an extensive literature search involving the role of varicoceles in sperm DNA damage. Of the 83 studies, 12 were selected that measured similar types of reactive sperm DNA damage. Seven studies determined the damage of sperm DNA in varicocele-associated patients and six studies evaluated the efficacy of varicocelectomy. One study was a duplicate because both outcomes were included. Data were analysed using RevMan software. The overall estimate showed that patients with varicoceles have significantly higher sperm DNA damage than controls, with a mean difference of 9.84% (95% CI 9.19 to 10.49; P<0.00001). A varicocelectomy can improve sperm DNA integrity, with a mean difference of -3.37% (95% CI -4.09 to -2.65; P<0.00001). In conclusion, there is increased sperm DNA damage in patients with varicoceles and varicocelectomy may be a possible treatment; however, more studies with appropriate controls are needed to confirm this finding. A varicocele is an important cause of male infertility and occurs in nearly 40% of infertile males. The recent understanding of the effect of varicoceles in male reproduction has led some researchers to postulate varicoceles as the possible cause of sperm DNA damage.

Methods: Sexual performance of 40 men was evaluated using the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMSFI) and Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT) before circumcision and at 4 months after circumcision. And their spouse's sexual function was also evaluated using Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) at corresponding time. The scores of the BMSFI and the IELT for treated men and the scores of FSFI for their spouse were comparatively analyzed. Results: No significant differences in the mean scores of BMSFI on five sections were found between after circumcision and before circumcision. However, the mean IELT was significantly longer after circumcision compared with that before circumcision. There was no obvious difference in the sexual arousal and orgasm sections after circumcision, significant difference in the scores of lubrication and pain sections of FSFI. Conclusion: Adult circumcision had no effects on male sexual function except increasing the mean IELT. But their spouse might have some negative experiences such as vaginal dryness and pain during sex intercourse after male circumcision. Thereafter, the man with redundant prepuce should have a scientific attitude on adult circumcision treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objective To study the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and TNF- \u03b1 in the rat model for nonbacterial chronic prostatitis and investigate the effects of tripterygium wilfordii polyglycosidium (TWP) on the ICAM-1 and TNF- \u03b1 in the rat model. Methods 30 Aged Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups:the control group(10 rats), the rat model for nonbacterial chronic prostatitis group(10 rats)and the rat model for nonbacterial chronic prostatitis treated with TWP group (10 rats). The expression of ICAM-1 and TNF- \u03b1 in rat prostatic tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry(sp). Results (1) The changes in histopathology and patho- physiology in the animal model were similar to those in clinical nonbacterial chronic prostatitis; (2)The ICAM-1 and TNF- \u03b1 in the rat model for nonbacterial chronic prostatitis group were higher than the control group (P<0.01); (3) Compared with the rat model for nonbacterial chronic prostatitis group, the ICAM-1 and TNF- \u03b1 in the rat model for nonbacte- rial chronic prostatitis treated with TWP group was abated (P<0.01); (4) A significant positive correlation existed between the expression of TNF- \u03b1 and that of ICAM-1 in the nonbacterial chronic prostatitis rats (r=0.83, P<0.01). Conclusion The TNF- \u03b1 and ICAM-1 may play an important role in the development of the nonbacterial chronic prostatitis. TWP may be a new treatment for the nonbacterial chronic prostatitis.",

        "abstract": "Aluminum fluoride (AlF(3)) is a low-refractive-index material widely used in coatings for deep-ultraviolet (DUV) optical systems, especially 193 nm laser systems. Low optical loss and stability are essential for film application. In this study, AlF(3)> thin films were prepared by thermal evaporation with a resistive heating boat. The effects of substrate temperatures and deposition rates on the optical properties in vacuum and in air, composition, and microstructures were discussed respectively. In vacuum the deposition parameters directly influenced the microstructures that determined the refractive index. When the films were exposed to air, aluminum oxide (Al(2)O(3)) formed in the films with water adsorption. Thus the refractive index increased and a nonmonotonic changing trend of the refractive index with substrate temperature was observed. The Al(2)O(3) was also found to be conductive to reducing absorption loss. AlF(3) films prepared at a high substrate temperature and deposition rate could yield stable structures with large optical loss.",

        "abstract": "As important components in deep-ultraviolet (DUV) optics, especially 193 nm lithographic systems, high-reflectivity (HR) mirrors with excellent optical properties and long lifetimes are needed urgently. In this study, we designed and produced three HR coatings for 193 nm on fused quartz substrates: Al 2O3/AlF3 coating, LaF3/AlF 3 coating and a double stack mirror with combined Al 2O3/AlF3 and LaF3/AlF3. The reflectance of the Al2O3/AlF3 coating with 14 layer pairs reached 98.0% at 193 nm. However, the absorption of Al 2O3 prevented the reflectance to increase further. The maximum reflectance of the LaF3/AlF3 coating with 15 layer pairs reached 98.1%, with initial micro-cracks formation. The reflectance decreased as the number of layer pairs increased to 16 because of numerous micro-cracks. The mirror with combined Al2O3/AlF 3 and LaF3/AlF3 coatings which combined their advantages obtained a reflectance of 98.8% at 193 nm after deposition. This value could still reach 98.5% at 4 months after deposition and remain stable thereafter. Therefore, the combined coating of Al2O 3/AlF3 and LaF3/AlF3 is an excellent candidate for practical application. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The results show that the damage threshold of coatings at cryogenic temperature is lower than the one at room temperature. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), optical profiler, step profiler and Atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to obtain the damage morphology, size and depth. Taking alteration of physical parameters, microstructure of coatings and the environmental pollution into consideration, we analyzed the key factor of lowering the coating damage threshold at cryogenic conditions.

The physical thickness and the optical phase change on reflection are considered. As an example, the wavefront aberration of the all-dielectric mirror is presented in ArF excimer lithography system with a typical thickness distribution. In addition, the wavefront errors of the thin film at wavelengths of 193 and 633 nm are compared in the one-piece and two-piece arrangements.

        "abstract": "In contrast to uncoated substrate, a nonlinear relationship of phase shift with the thicknesses of the thin film makes the calculation of wavefront aberration complicated. A program is compiled to calculate the wavefront aberration of multilayer thin film produced by thickness nonuniformity. The physical thickness and the optical phase change on reflection are considered. As an example, the wavefront aberration of the all-dielectric mirror is presented in ArF excimer lithography system with a typical thickness distribution. In addition, the wavefront errors of the thin film at wavelengths of 193 and 633 nm are compared in the one-piece and two-piece arrangements. Results show that the phase shift upon reflection of the thin film produced by thickness nonuniformity is very sensitive to the incident angle, wavelength, and polarization.",

The relationships between optical properties, mechanical properties and laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) at 355nm of AlF3 films were discussed. Both absorption and stress increased with increasing substrate temperatures and deposition rates, which was a disadvantage to laser-induced damage resistance. Meanwhile, interfacial adhesion and hardness increased with substrate temperatures and deposition rates, which was an advantage to enhance the LIDT. The LIDT increased from room temperature to 200\u00b0C duo to increasing interfacial adhesion and hardness, and then decreased to 300\u00b0C duo to increasing absorption and stress. The LIDT decreased with deposition rates due to increasing absorption and stress. \u00a9 2013 SPIE.",

METHODS: A total of 263 patients either with respiratory infection or urinary infection were enrolled into this multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical study, including 131 patients received domestic faropenem tablets as the trial group and 132 patients received cefuroxime axetil tablets as the control group. Every individual in both groups was given 1 tablet tid, orally for 6 to 14 d. RESULTS: The cure and effective rates were 75.2 % (97/129) and 96.9 % (125/129) in trial group, 75.6% (99/131) and 98.5 % (129/131) in control group. The bacterial eradication rates were 97.1 % vs 99.0 % and the adverse events rates were 4.6 % (6/130) vs 4.5 % (6/132) in the trial and control groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Domestic faropenem is as effective and well-tolerated as cefuroxime axetil for the treatment of bacterial infections.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial senescence contributes to atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD), but the mechanisms are yet to be clarified. We identified that microRNA-216a (miR-216a) significantly increased in senescent endothelial cells. The replicative senescence model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was established to explore the role of miR-216a in endothelial ageing and dysfunction. Luciferase assay indicated that Smad3 was a direct target of miR-216a. Stable expression of miR-216a induced a premature senescence-like phenotype in HUVECs with an impairment in proliferation and migration and led to an increased adhesion to monocytes by inhibiting Smad3 expression and thereafter modulating the degradation of NF-\u03baB inhibitor alpha (I\u03baB\u03b1) and activation of adhesion molecules. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-216a in senescent HUVECs rescued Smad3 and I\u03baB\u03b1 expression and inhibited monocytes attachment. Plasma miR-216a was significantly higher in old CAD patients (>50\u00a0years) and associated with increased 31% risk for CAD (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.66; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) compared with the matched healthy controls (>50\u00a0years). Taken together, our data suggested that miR-216a promotes endothelial senescence and inflammation as an endogenous inhibitor of Smad3/I\u03baB\u03b1 pathway, which might serve as a novel target for ageing-related atherosclerotic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Macrophages exhibit heterogeneity and plasticity and imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages plays a critical role in atherosclerosis progression. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in macrophages can be activated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), but the regulation of telomerase activation on macrophages polarization remains unknown. We previously identified microRNA-216a (miR-216a) to promote inflammation through directly targeting the Smad3/NF-\u03baB pathway. The present study aimed to assess whether miR-216a can regulate telomerase activity and promote macrophages polarization during atherosclerosis progression. The results verified that TERT was highly expressed in macrophages of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. miR-216a was found to promote telomerase activation in macrophages by 4.5-fold (P\u202f=\u202f0.002) through the Smad3/NF-\u03baB pathway. miR-216a also induced macrophages senescence characterized by senescence-associated-\u03b2-galactosidase activity and p53 and p16 expression. TERT overexpression promoted the transformation of M2 to M1 while this conversion was suppressed once TERT was inhibited, and the related inflammatory factors and lipid uptake ability of M1 cells were also increased by TERT. In the carotid atherosclerotic plaques from miR-216a-treated apolipoprotein E mice, the numbers of M1 macrophages were increased whereas M2 cells reduced, accompanying with inhibited Smad3 expression and upregulated inflammatory markers and TERT activity. Furthermore, plasma miR-216a level was specifically higher in patients with vulnerable mixed plaques (n\u202f=\u202f181) than those with calcified plaques (n\u202f=\u202f73) and controls (n\u202f=\u202f264). In summary, our findings first revealed a new molecular mechanism of macrophage polarization involving telomerase activation induced by miR-216a through the Smad3/NF-\u03baB signaling, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis progression.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of aTRH in older people and describe the characteristics of older patients with aTRH. Using two-stage random clustering sampling, 3774 patients with hypertension aged \u226560-75\u00a0years were recruited between July 2012 and December 2015. The patients were divided into two groups: aTRH and non-aTRH groups according to their blood pressure (BP) levels, and whether or not they reached goal BP value. A multivariable logistical model was used to evaluate the risk factors of aTRH. The rate of antihypertensive treatment was 75.1%, BP control rate was 40.7%, and the prevalence of aTRH was 5.97% (169) according to the cross-sectional data among all the patients. The prevalence of aTRH patients taking 4 different classes of antihypertensive drugs or more was found to be 3.29% (93) in this study. Compared with non-aTRH patients, those with aTRH had a worse cardiovascular risk profile, including obesity (29.61% vs 20.53%, P =\u00a00.005), hyperlipidemia (54.44% vs 46.66%, P =\u00a00.050), type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM) (34.31% vs 25.64%, P =\u00a00.013), and stroke (26.03% vs 19.26%, P =\u00a00.032). After multivariable adjustment, logistic regression analyses showed that the risk factors of aTRH were male sex (OR 1.638; 95%CI 1.196-2.245, P =\u00a00.002) and 2-DM (OR 1. 371; 95%CI 0.995-1.888, P =\u00a00.049). Regular physical exercise (OR 0.696; 95%CI 0.505-0.960, P =\u00a00.049) was a protective factor of aTRH. The prevalence of aTRH was 5.97% in older people in this cross-sectional study in China.",

Our previous work showed that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression was particularly observed in the macrophage-rich region of atherosclerotic lesions.

In the present study, we aimed to examine the role of miR-216a in the activation of telomerase during macrophages differentiation. Methods and results: To investigate whether TERT is expressed particularly in macrophages of the atherosclerotic lesion, we performed immunofluorescent test on the human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, and the co-localization of TERT with macrophage CD68 immuno-reactivity was verified.

        "abstract": "Background: Among the age-associated functional and structural changes, of particular note is cellular senescence of endothelial cells, which plays a key role in endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. But the molecular basis of which is not fully defined. We have identified that a particular microRNA, miR-216a, was up-regulated in senescent endothelial cells, here, the present study aimed to determine the role of miR-216a in regulating premature senescence and angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. Methods and results: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured and population-doubling levels (PDLs) were calculated during passages. Briefly, PDLs was computed as Log2 (Ch/Cs), where Ch was the number of viable cells at harvest and Cs was the number of cells seeded. PDL8 and PDL44 were respectively identified as young and senescent HUVECs, with increased expression of p53 and p21 and shortened telomere length in PDL44. We found that miR-216a expression is up-regulated by 64% in PDL44...",

Though the physiological process of aging is still not fully understood, several cellular and molecular mechanisms have been identified. Long noncoding RNAs is a class of regulatory ncRNAs with transcript lengths u003e200 nucleotides. Discovery of this vast pool of regulators in mammalian genome supplies a new dimension to study and explore the aging process. In this review, we discuss the contribution of lncRNAs in aging and aging complications, and raise interest of serving lncRNAs as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to prolong health and ameliorate age-associated diseases. We hope understanding the roles of these high specificity and low conservation regulators in generating age-associated phenotypes might benefit human lifespan.",

        "abstract": "To review comprehensively the prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension; and to estimate the burden of hypertension in China, thereby aiding Chinese health policies for better prevention and control of this condition.PubMed, EMbase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Chongqing VIP databases were searched for population-based studies published in English and Chinese that described prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension in China, as well as deaths and disabilities attributed to hypertension. All research papers were published between January 1999 and May 2014. Data from 178 studies involving over 2,901,464 participants covering 30 provinces were pooled. Overall, rates of prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension were 28.9%, 35.3% and 13.4% in China. A statistically significant association was observed between temperature gradient and the prevalence of hypertension. There were 10,667 (95% confidence interval 8063-13,345) disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people. In total, 78.3% of disability-adjusted life years were from years lived with disability and 21.7% from years of life lost due to premature mortality.Although there has been a slight improvement in rates for the treatment and control of hypertension, these rates were still suboptimal, especially for men and people living in rural areas. Low and middle-income provinces had a comparatively huge burden of hypertension, which is a considerable risk factor for reducing life expectancy. Our analysis may be helpful in generating a current overview of hypertension in China.",

With the theoretical analysis, we optimize the cavity's fiber length for getting higher output power within the scheme, i.e., shorter fiber length is preferred for efficiently harvesting the first order random lasing at the open end of the cavity. As the verification of the theory, we experimentally demonstrate a high output power (7 W), highly efficient (70% optical conversion efficiency) RFL working at 1140 nm, using 10 W 1090 nm laser as the pump source and only 1 km standard single-mode fiber as the distributed cavity.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that employs a statistical learning technique to analyze and quantify the effect of various network characteristics relating to the optimal solution of the FCNF problem. In particular, we create a probabilistic classifier based on 18 network related variables to produce a quantitative measure that an arc in the network will have a non-zero flow in an optimal solution. The predictive model achieves 85% cross-validated accuracy.

        "abstract": "Abstract   Transportation infrastructure has been identified by the US Department of Homeland Security as one of sixteen critical infrastructure systems essential to the well-being of modern societies. In this study, we propose a resilience-based framework for mitigating risk to surface road transportation networks. We utilize recent developments in modern network theory to introduce a novel metric based on system reliability and network connectivity to measure resilience-based performance of a road transportation network. The formulation of this resilience-based performance metric (referred in the paper as WIPW), systematically integrates the network topology, redundancy level, traffic patterns, structural reliability of network components (i.e. roads and bridge) and functionality of the network during community\u2019s post-disaster recovery, and permits risk mitigation alternatives for improving transportation network resilience to be compared on a common basis. Using the WIPW as a network performance metric, we propose a project ranking mechanism for identifying and prioritizing transportation network retrofit projects that are critical for effective pre-disaster risk mitigation and resilience planning. We further present a decision methodology to select optimal solutions among possible alternatives of new construction, which offer opportunities to improve the resilience of the network by altering its existing topology. Finally, we conclude with an illustration that uses the WIPW as the performance metric to support risk-based mitigation decisions using a hypothetical bridge network susceptible to seismic hazards.",

A new heuristic procedure for the fixed charge network flow problem is proposed. The new method leverages a probabilistic model to create an informed reformulation and relaxation of the FCNF problem. The technique relies on probability estimates that an edge in a graph should be included in an optimal flow solution. These probability estimates, derived from a statistical learning technique, are used to reformulate the problem as a linear program which can be solved efficiently. This method can be used as an independent heuristic for the fixed charge network flow problem or as a primal heuristic. In rigorous testing, the solution quality of the new technique is evaluated and compared to results obtained from a commercial solver software. Testing demonstrates that the novel prediction-based relaxation outperforms linear programming relaxation in solution quality and that as a primal heuristic the method significantly improves the solutions found for large problem instances within a given time limit.",

The methodology systematically incorporates network topology, redundancy, traffic flow, damage level and available resources into the stochastic processes of network post-hazard recovery strategy optimisation. Two metrics are proposed for measuring rapidity and efficiency of the network recovery: total recovery time (TRT) and the skew of the recovery trajectory (SRT). The TRT is the time required for the network to be restored to its pre-hazard functionality level, while the SRT is a metric defined for the first time in this study to capture the characteristics of the recovery trajectory that relates to the efficiency of those restoration strategies considered.

        "abstract": "Abstract   This study develops a decision model to assist bridge authorities in determining a preferred maintenance prioritization schedule for a degraded bridge network in a community that optimizes the performance of transportation systems within budgetary constraints at a regional scale. The study utilizes network analysis methods, structural reliability principles and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to integrate individual descriptive parameters such as bridge capacity rating, condition rating, traffic demand, and location of the bridge, into global objective functions that define the overall network performance and maintenance cost. The performance of the network is measured in terms of travel time between all possible origin-destination (O-D) pairs. In addition to the global budgetary constraint, the optimization is also conditioned on local constraints imposed on traffic flow by insufficient load carrying capacity of deficient bridges. Uncertainties in traffic demands, vehicle weights and maintenance costs are also considered in the problem formulation. Two project priority indices are introduced \u2013 the static priority index (SPI), defined as a function of the difference in network travel time between block running (with reduced load carrying capacity before repair) and smooth running (design-level load carrying capacity after repair) of a bridge, and the dynamic priority index (DPI) defined as the likelihood of a bridge being selected for repair when the budget is fixed and the uncertainties governing the performance of the transportation network are considered. Finally, this decision model is illustrated with a hypothetical network with 160 bridges.",

Using the three IPW-based decision metrics, a stage-wise decision process is then formulated as a stochastic multi-objective optimization problem, which includes a project ranking mechanism to identify pre-disaster network retrofit projects in Phase I, a prioritization approach for temporary repairs to facilitate immediate post-disaster emergency responses in Phase II, and a methodology for scheduling network-wide repairs during the long-term recovery of the roadway system in Phase III.

In the present study, we isolated starches from the grains of sorghum, tartary buckwheat, common buckwheat, mungbean, and pea and studied their structural and physicochemical properties. These five starches all showed the distinctive \"Maltese cross\" effect (birefringence) but significantly differed in morphology, size, and complexity of granules. Sorghum starch exhibited the lowest amylose content and highest weight-average molar mass. Mungbean contained more short amylopectin [degree of polymerization (DP) 6-12\u202f=\u202f23.4%]. Pea starch exhibited the highest amylose content, highest amylopectin average chain length, and lowest weight-average molar mass. The starches of sorghum, tartary buckwheat, and common buckwheat showed A-type crystallinity, whereas those of mungbean and pea showed C-type crystallinity. Our results provide useful information for the application of coarse grain starches in diverse industries.",

        "abstract": "Proso and foxtail millets are widely cultivated due to their excellent resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and high nutritional value. Starch is the most important component of millet kernels. Starches with different amylose contents have different physicochemical properties. In this study, starches in proso (non-waxy and waxy) and foxtail millets (non-waxy and waxy) were isolated and investigated. All the starch granules had regular polygonal round shapes and exhibited typical \"Maltese crosses\". These four starches all showed bimodal size distribution. The waxy proso and foxtail millets had higher weight-average molar mass and branching degree and lower average chain length of amylopectin. These four starches all presented A-type crystallinity; however, the relative crystallinity of waxy proso and foxtail millets was higher. The two waxy millets had higher onset temperature, peak temperature, conclusion temperature, and gelatinization enthalpy. However, the two non-waxy millets had higher setback viscosity, peak time, and pasting temperature. The significantly different physicochemical properties of waxy and non-waxy millet starches resulted in their different functional properties.",

The IL-LDH-Mb composite was characterized by UV-vis adsorption spectroscopy and the results indicated that Mb retained its native structure in the IL-LDH nanocomposite. The IL-LDH-Mb bionanocomposite was modified on the surface of carbon ionic liquid electrode to get an Mb modified electrode. Electrochemical experiments showed that direct electrochemistry of Mb in the composite was realized with a pair of well-defined redox peaks appeared, which could be attributed to the specific microenvironment provided by layer structured LDH and high ionic conductive IL present for Mb molecule. The modified electrode exhibited good direct electrocatalytic ability to the reduction of trichloroacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide with good stability and reproducibility. Different kinds of real samples were detected by the modified electrode with satisfactory results. So the IL-LDH nanocomposite provided a novel and efficient platform for the immobilization of enzymes, which had potential applications in the fabrication of third-generation biosensors.",

Spectroscopic results indicated that Mb retained its native structures without any conformational changes after mixed with CoMoO4 nanorods and CTS.

        "abstract": "The sizeable direct bandgap, high mobility, and long spin lifetimes at room temperature offer black phosphorus (BP) potential applications in spin-based semiconductor devices. Toward these applications, a critical step is creating a magnetic response in BP, which is arousing much interest. It is reported here that ambient degradation of BP, which is immediate and inevitable and greatly changes the semiconducting properties, creates magnetic moments, and any degree of degradation leads to notable paramagnetism. Its Landau factor g measured is \u22481.995, revealing that the magnetization mainly results from spin rather than orbital moments. Such magnetism most likely results from the unsaturated phosphorus in the vacancies which are stabilized by O adatoms. It can be tuned by changing any one of the ambient factors of ambient temperature, humidity, and light intensity, and can be stabilized by exposing BP in argon. The findings highlight the importance of evaluating the effect of ambient degradation-induced magnetism on BP's spin-based devices. The work seems an essential milestone toward the forthcoming research upsurge on BP's magnetism.",

Despite that the magnetism of single and multi-layer GNRs have been widely investigated before, the situation of bilayer GNRs (BLGNRs) is entirely unknown experimentally. Inspired by the potential applications in spintronics, here we report the synthesis of pristine BLGNRs with the average width of ca. 9\u202fnm by longitudinal unzipping the oxalic acid-intercalated double-walled carbon nanotubes followed by annealing at 900\u202f\u00b0C. The magnetic properties of BLGNRs were investigated. The results reveal that BLGNRs show obvious antiferromagnetic behavior with the Neel temperature of ca. 66 K. It is proposed that (i) the spin-polarized edge states are the dominant magnetic source, and (ii) the antiferromagnetism is mainly caused by the interlayer couplings.",

The saturated magnetization (Ms) of aGONRs-400 is high up to 0.39 emu/g at room temperature, and the RT ferromagnetism (FM) exhibits excellent ambient stability with Ms preserved for over half a year. The preferential distribution of the magnetic phenolic hydroxyl towards the edges, which contributes to the long-range ferromagnetic couplings, was confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement and gradient annealing analysis. The approach of low-temperature annealing is proved to be efficient both to remove the prominent nonmagnetic epoxy groups on the basal plane of GONRs or transform them to magnetic hydroxyl groups, and to preserve the magnetic phenolic hydroxyl at the edges to realize the strong and ambient stable FM.",

The as-prepared 201-MoS-Ni-CNTs composites exhibit remarkably enhanced microwave absorption performance compared to Ni-MoS or Ni-CNTs. The minimum reflection loss (RL) value of 201-MoS-Ni-CNTs/wax composites with filler loading ratio of 30 wt % reached -50.08 dB at the thickness of 2.4 mm. The maximum effective microwave absorption bandwidth (RL< -10 dB) of 6.04 GHz was obtained at the thickness of 2.1 mm. The excellent absorption ability originates from appropriate impedance matching ratio, strong dielectric loss and large surface area, which are attributed to the \"201\" nanostructure. In addition, this method could be extended to other low-dimensional materials, proving to be an efficient and promising strategy for high microwave absorption performance.",

        "abstract": "A composite superhydrophobic coating was tape casted on the surface of aluminum alloy specimens which is composed of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MAH) and polypropylene (PP). The aluminum alloy specimens were pretreated by silane coupling agent KH550 to increase the adherence between aluminum alloy specimens and PP-g-MAH. The pretreatment surfaces were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The adherence and superhydrophobicity of the composite coating were also tested by QFZ-II adhero meter and OCA-20 optical contact angle meter, respectively. Finally, the morphology of the composite coating was also investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that KH550 is mainly responsible for the increase of adherence between aluminum alloy specimens and PP-g-MAH due to the formation of chemical bond Si-O-Al and polysiloxane coating. As for the superhydrophobicity, the PP coating covers the polar group maleic anhydride which restricts the decrease of superhydrophobicity. At the same time, the concentration of PP-g-MAH and PP solution has an important effect on the hierarchical structure and superhydrophobicity of the composite coating. When the concentration is 5 g L\u22121, the coating has a fine structure with an unsatisfying hydrophobicity. When the concentration is more than 17 g L\u22121, the composite coating has a prominent hierarchical structure and its superhydrophobicity keeps at relative stable level. However, when the concentration is more than 50 g L\u22121, the solution has a weak spreadability and the coating can not easily flow flatly. Sometimes the coating will be cracked.",

        "abstract": "Boron carbide powder (B4C) was added into phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin to increase the high temperatural bond strength of PF resin. Using the modified PF resin silicon carbide block could be bonded satisfactorily even treated at 700\u2013800\u00b0C, and its bond strength was higher than 20 MPa. The thermal modification mechanism was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray, and pyrolysis gas chromatography spectrum coupled with a mass spectrum. The results indicate that B4C can increase the heat resistance of PF resin efficiently. B4C can not only seize some active groups of the resin matrix including phenolic hydroxyl and methylol, but also can hold the main components of some volatiles such as CO, H2O, phenol, and its derivations in the resin matrix by chemical reactions. At the same time, the reaction product boron oxide closes and mends the microcracks for its satisfactory wettability and adhesive capacity. In consequence, the efficient components escaping from the resin matrix can be sharply reduced. A relative intact skeleton of the resin is obtained, and its bond strength and thermal stability are remarkably elevated.",

In this study, MRSA isolates obtained from a tertiary caret hospital in China were subjected to  typing, SCC typing, multiple locus sequence typing (MLST), and PCR targeting of the genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). The disk diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates to 10 non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Among the 120 MRSA isolates studied, 18  types and 15 ST types were identified. The  t311 type was the most common (a total of 60 isolates; 50%) among the study strains, and nearly all the t311 strains belonged to ST5, which is the most common ST type that was previously reported from China among the t002 isolates. ST5-II/t311 was the major prevalent clone (55, 45.8%), which was followed by ST5-II/t002 (12, 10.0%) and ST59-IV/t437 (11, 9.2%). PVL-encoding genes were found in 6.7% of the isolates. Although the ST5-II/t311 and ST5-II/t002 clones are different  types, they shared the same resistance profile (clindamycin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin). Most isolates of the ST239-III/t037 clone were resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. By contrast, the MRSA isolates of the ST239-III/t030 clone were more resistant to rifampin, but they were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

In this study, we explored the clinical and microbiological characteristics of PLA in Chinese patients.A 5-year (2010-2014) retrospective review of medical records on all PLA patients who were admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital was performed.Among 217 PLA cases who were confirmed cultural positive, Klebsiella pneumonia (K pneumonia) was the most common pathogen (n\u200a=\u200a165, 76.0%), followed by Escherichia coli (n\u200a=\u200a21, 9.7%). Notably, there is a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients with K pneumoniae-induced PLA (KP-PLA) than that with non-K pneumoniae-induced PLA (non-KP-PLA)(43.0% vs 21.2%, P\u200a=\u200a.005). However, it was less prevalent for concomitant hepatobiliary disease (20.0% vs 34.6%, P\u200a=\u200a.039) and history of intraabdominal trauma or surgery (13.3% vs 38.5%, P\u200a<\u200a.001) in patients with KP-PLA. Although K pneumoniae are sensitive to most common antibiotics (antibiotic resistance rates below 10%), some strains (1.2%) developed resistant to carbapenem. These results confirmed K pneumoniae as the predominant pathogen of PLA in the area in which the study was conducted. More attention should be directed toward monitoring the emergence of carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae.KP-PLA is frequently diagnosed in patients with metabolic diseases accompanied by serious consequences, and it is therefore prudent to see that they receive sensitivity-directed antibiotic therapy.",

Herein, this study aims to develop a simple and effective approach to in situ incorporate 2D graphene oxide (GO) nanopletlets into thermosensitive matrix to acquire hybrid nanogels with good stability and photothermal effect. In order to improve its stability, GO firstly underwent silanization to its surface with double bonds, followed by intercalation with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) in the presence of disulfide-containing crosslinker via an emulsion method. Radical polymerization was then initiated to accelerate direct GO exfoliation in PNIPAM nanogels by forming covalent bonds between them. The well-dispersed GO nanopletlets in the nanogels not only displayed an enhanced photothermal effect, but also improved the encapsulation efficiency of an anticancer drug. The hybrid nanogels accelerate drug release under conditions mimicking the acidic/reducible solid tumor and intracellular microenvironments, most importantly, it can be further enhanced via remote photothermal treatment. The multifunctional nanogels potentiate their synergistic anticancer bioactivity as an ideal nanoplatform for cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The synthesis of graphene oxide (GO)\u2014based nanocomposite materials, as environment-friendly nanostructures suitable for novel applications, has received significant attention in recent years. In this paper, a series of GO have been successfully fabricated utilizing the modified Hummers\u2019 method. GO was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) respectively. The characterization results showed that GO nanosheets have hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups and were well exfoliated. The graphene oxide/polystyrene (PSt) nanocomposite emulsion was synthesized via Pickering emulsion polymerization in the presence of GO nanosheets as a sole emulsifier. TEM, SEM and XRD results all suggested the successful preparation of GO-stabilized PSt colloidal particles. The Pickering emulsion products showed that the average diameter of nanocomposite particles can be well controlled from 240 to 320\u00a0nm by variation of the GO content. The GO layer was wrapped on the surface of PSt microspheres. PSt/GO nanocomposites have higher crystallinity and better thermal stability than pure PSt. Graphene oxide was not only being used as an effective solid stabilizer for Pickering emulsion, but also dispersed homogeneously into the production of polystyrene as highly effective nanofiller.",

        "abstract": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-dependent apoptosis is important in the elimination of damaged or abnormal cells from normal tissues in vivo. Previously, we have shown that TGF-beta inhibits the growth of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE)-1 cells. However, RIE-1 cells are relatively resistant to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis due to a low endogenous Smad3-to-Akt ratio. Overexpression of Smad3 sensitizes RIE-1 cells (RIE-1/Smad3) to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis by altering the Smad3-to-Akt ratio in favor of apoptosis. In this study, we utilized a genomic approach to identify potential downstream target genes that are regulated by TGF-beta/Smad3. Total RNA samples were analyzed using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that TGF-beta regulated 518 probe sets corresponding to its target genes. Interestingly, among the known apoptotic genes included in the microarray analyses, only caspase-3 was induced, which was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, TGF-beta activated caspase-3 through protein cleavage. Upstream of caspase-3, TGF-beta induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and cleavage of caspase-9, which suggests that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediates TGF-beta-induced apoptosis in RIE-1/Smad3 cells.",

        "abstract": "Because laboratory tests are expensive and time-consuming and may not be available to farmers, soil nitrate quick tests are required for optimal nitrogen management strategies in China to increase nitrogen use effciency and to reduce nitrogen losses. A total of 328 soil samples were collected at different soil depths from 225 sites in China, which covered a wide range of climatic and geographic regions, soil types, croplands and soil textures, to evaluate the suitability of a quick reflectometer test method for analysing soil NO-3 -N in a wide range of soil NO-3 concentrations, soil types and cropping systems in China, mainly by comparison of soil NO-3 -N assessed by a quick-test method (a reflectometer) and a standard laboratory method, i.e., high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The reflectometer showed excellent agreement with the laboratory HPLC method with regard to soil nitrate contents for all analysed soil samples. The linear regression had slopes of 1 \u00b1 0.08 and intercepts of \u00b11.38 mg NO-3 -N L-1 among different soil types and croplands. Compared with the 1:1 lines, the regression analysis for each soil type showed statistically significant but small differences in slope; the relative difference between the values measured using the two analytical systems varied from -8% to 6%, and there were no differences in intercept except for paddy soil. The reflectometer showed adequate, statistically significant precision in determining soil nitrate contents, and it could therefore be directly used instead of the laboratory methods for soil NO-3 -N measurement in China.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The genome of spinach single chromosome complement is about 1000 Mbp, which is the model material to study the molecular mechanisms of plant sex differentiation. The cytological study showed that the biggest spinach chromosome (chromosome 1) was taken as spinach sex chromosome. It had three alleles of sex-related X, X m and Y. Many researchers have been trying to clone the sex-determining genes and investigated the molecular mechanism of spinach sex differentiation. However, there are no successful cloned reports about these genes. A new technology combining chromosome microdissection with hybridization-specific amplification (HSA) was adopted. The spinach Y chromosome degenerate oligonucleotide primed-PCR (DOP-PCR) products were hybridized with cDNA of the male spinach flowers in florescence. The female spinach genome was taken as blocker and cDNA library specifically expressed in Y chromosome was constructed. Moreover, expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in cDNA library were cloned, sequenced and bioinformatics was analysed. There were 63 valid EST sequences obtained in this study. The fragment size was between 53 and 486 bp. BLASTn homologous alignment indicated that 12 EST sequences had homologous sequences of nucleic acids, the rest were new sequences. BLASTx homologous alignment indicated that 16 EST sequences had homologous protein-encoding nucleic acid sequence. The spinach Y chromosome-specific EST sequences laid the foundation for cloning the functional genes, specifically expressed in spinach Y chromosome. Meanwhile, the establishment of the technology system in the research provided a reference for rapid cloning of other biological sex chromosome-specific EST sequences.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the accumulation characteristics of tungsten (W) by different indica rice cultivars from the soil and to assess the potential risks to human health via dietary intake of W in rice consumption. A total of 153 rice (ear) samples of 15 cultivars and the corresponding surface soil samples were collected from 7 cities in Fujian Province of southeastern China. The available soil W were extracted using HCO\u00b72HO-(NH)CO\u00b7HO at pH 3.3). Results showed that the total soil W ranged from 2.03\u00a0mg\u00a0kg to 15.34\u00a0mg\u00a0kgand available soil W ranged from 0.03\u00a0mg\u00a0kg to 1.61\u00a0mg\u00a0kg. The W concentration in brown rice varied from 7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg to 283\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg and was significantly correlated with the available soil W. The highest mean TF (transfer factor based on available soil W) was 0.91 for Te-you 627 (hybrid, indica rice), whereas the lowest was 0.08 for Yi-you 673 (hybrid, indica rice). The TF decreased with the increase in available soil W, clay content, and cation exchange capacity. The consumption of the brown rice produced from the investigated areas in some cultivars by the present study may cause risks to human health.",

        "abstract": "Sinter quasi-particles consist of nuclei particles and adhering fines. Therefore, reaction properties of the nuclei ore will ultimately affect the bonding strength of the sintered body. In this study, micro-sintering tests were conducted to explore the melt absorbability of nuclei ore and its effect on the suitable liquid content of the sintered body. The results showed that the melt absorbability is negatively correlated with the lowest assimilation temperature, and the most important mineralogy factor influencing melt absorbability is iron mineral type. The reaction behaviors of melts containing SiO2 or Al2O3 substrates are different, and the reaction process of the melt containing SiO2 is more complicated. In addition, the bonding strength of the sintered body is collectively determined by the liquid phase fluidity of adhering fines and the assimilability of nuclei ore. The high melt absorbability has an adverse effect on bonding strength, and it requires adhering fines to provide more primary melts to meet the requirements for sintered body bonding strength. In the condition with the same liquid content, for nuclei ore with stronger melt absorbability, an appropriate increase in the adhering fines ratio and reduction in segregation basicity are more conducive to improving the bonding strength.",

The softening and melting process of Meishan concentrate, the main mineral in the sintering of Meishan Iron and Steel Company, and four typical imported iron ores were observed through a visual micro-sintering test device. The results show that the Meishan concentrate has a relatively gentle liquid-phase velocity, good liquid-phase temperature control property, and relatively good safety. In addition, with the increase in alkalinity, its melting characteristics become worse. When combined with OA, its melting characteristics became worse, and with OD ore, its melting characteristics had improved in our study.

Then the nonlinear least squares fitting method is used to extract the three characteristic parameters \u03b2, \u03c4 and \u0394e of Davidson-Cole model, and the relationship between the characteristic parameters of the aging model and the aging state of the transformer oil-paper will be established. The results show that the three model parameters extracted from the experimental data are all related to the degree of polymerization of the oil-paper. With the extension of aging time, the value of the shape parameter \u03b2 and the relaxation time parameter \u03c4 will all decrease with the reduction of the degree of polymerization, but the former presents an exponential relationship, the latter is a linear relationship. Besides, the \u0394e will increase with the decrease of the degree of polymerization, and it is not related to the temperature in a certain range.",

Firstly, XY equivalent model without moisture was composed of dry oil impregnated pressboard (OIP) and dry transformer oil, the FDS quantitative calculation formula of the dry XY equivalent model was derived based on characteristics of composite dielectric. Then according to the characteristics of mixture of moisture and OIP, the concept of the parallel factor was used in this paper, and the dielectric constant of OIP with moisture was derived. Furthermore, combined with the formula obtained from the first stage, the formula of the FDS of the XY equivalent model with moisture was derived. To verify the correctness of the above theoretical derivation, the XY equivalent models with different moisture content were prepared in laboratory, and the moisture content and the frequency domain dielectric spectroscopy of the above samples were tested respectively by Karl Fisher titration method and IDAX-300. The results of moisture content test were substituted into the above formula to calculate the FDS of the XY equivalent model. It can be found a good fit when compared with the measured FDS, therefore the correctness of the theoretical derivation was verified.",

The electrochemical characteristics of EDLCs assembled by 1\u2009mol/L P 11 -BF 4 /PC paired with activated carbon electrodes were compared to traditional electrolytes. P 11 -BF 4  has proven to have superior voltage resistance by using cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge testing. Moreover, P 11 -BF 4  exhibits a more brilliant rate performance due to its high conductivity. These results demonstrate that P 11 -BF 4  is an ideal electrolyte to improve the energy density and power density of supercapacitors.",

        "abstract": "The objective scaling ensemble approach is a novel two-phase heuristic for integer linear programming problems shown to be effective on a wide variety of integer linear programming problems. The technique identifies and aggregates multiple partial solutions to modify the problem formulation and significantly reduce the search space. An empirical analysis on publicly available benchmark problems demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by outperforming standard solution strategies implemented in modern optimization software.",

        "title": "Empirical analysis of metaheuristic search techniques for the parameterized dynamic slope scaling procedure",
        "abstract": "The dynamic slope scaling procedure is an approximation method successfully which solves the fixed charge network flow (FCNF) problem by iteratively linearizing the fixed cost. The parameterized dynamic slope scaling procedure adds an additional $psi$ parameter to the procedure which can significantly improve the solution quality. Finding the optimal value of $psi$ for a given problem is non-trivial. This paper employs multiple metaheuristic techniques, including simulated annealing, tabu search, and particle swarm optimization, to guide the search for good parameter values. In rigorous testing, we examine the search results, compare the improvement efficiencies among the techniques, and evaluate the final solution quality of the FCNF problem. The experiments show that the solution improvement is robust with respect to these metaheuristics and the complexity of FCNF problem.",
