The results show that the GGA calculations with the PW91 functional systemically overestimate the adsorption energy by 0.2-0.4 eV than the DFT ones with the hybrid functional, resulting in the failure of GGA with the PW91 functional for predicting the adsorption behavior of molecular oxygen on Au clusters. Our DFT calculations with the hybrid functional give the same adsorption behavior of molecular oxygen on Au cluster anions and cations as the experimental measurements. For the neutral Au clusters, the hybrid DFT predicts that only Au(3) and Au(5) clusters can adsorb one O(2) molecule.",

        "abstract": "Radix Bupleuri (RB) is a commonly used herbal drug in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and it can be baked with vinegar to afford vinegar-baked Radix Bupleuri (VBRB), which is used in TCM for liver diseases treatment. In this study, the chemical compositions and biological effects between raw and two processed RBs by different vinegars were systematically compared.The chemical compositions of raw and two processed RBs were analyzed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis. Two different extraction procedures were used, including direct extraction and liquid-liquid partition. Then HPLC was applied to determine the changes of saikosaponin contents. In addition, their liver protective effects against CCl4 induced liver injury were also investigated, and the biochemical parameters and histopathology were measured after treatment of mice with raw RB and two processed RBs (5g/kg/day) for 14 days.Multivariate analysis showed clear differences between the raw and the two processed RBs, and the vinegar-baking process induced elevated contents of ssb1, ssb2, acetic acid, malic acid, citric acid, 5-HMF, and ligustrazine, as well as the decreased contents of ssa, ssd, sucrose, glycine, succinic acid etc. In addition, both raw and processed RBs showed liver protective effects against CCl4 induced liver injury, and the vinegar-baked RBs showed better effects than that of raw RB.The raw and vinegar-baked RBs differed not only in the chemical compositions but also in the pharmacological effects. And two processed RBs also showed chemical differences, suggesting that the type of vinegar had an important effect on vinegar baking. In order to ensure the therapeutic effect and safety of TCM, the effect of different vinegars on processing of herbal drugs should be further studied.",

In electrides the donated electron behaves like a low-density correlated electron gas, whereby the dimensionality of the electron gas and its electronic and magnetic properties are determined by the topology of the cavities in the host matrix. Unlike traditional electrides, in which alkali cations are encapsulated within an organic cage, inorganic electrides are thermally stable. The current inorganic electrides based on alkali metal loaded zeolites can be designed as useful reduced-dimensionality materials. Inorganic electrides are powerful reducing agents, and they are able to reduce small aromatic molecules to the radical anions within the channels of the zeolite.",

The inhibitory effects of IM on Sup-B15/shVEC and Sup-B15 leukemia cells were measured by CCK-8 test, and the apoptosis of those cells was determined by AnnexinV/7-AAD dyeing using flow cytometry, the percentage of CD34⁺CD38⁻ leukemia cells also by flow cytometry. ALDH1 mRNA levels were detected by real-time RT-PCR, and protein levels of CD144, CD133, Bcr-abl and β-catenin by Western blot.IM treatment presented inhibitory effects on Sup-B15/shVEC and Sup-B15 leukemia cells at multiple concentrations of IM. The IC50 of IM on Sup-B15/shVEC and Sup-B15 leukemia cells were 25.1μmol/L and 18.7μmol/L, respectively (P<0.05). After 48h of 20 μmol/L IM treatment, the percentages of apoptosis cell in Sup-B15/shVEC cells and Sup-B15 cell were (13.52±2.06)% and (3.03±0.72) %, respectively (P<0.05). The percentage of CD34⁺CD38⁻ cells in Sup-B15 cells was significantly higher than in Sup-B15/shVEC cells [(2.39±0.28)% vs (0.96±0.07)%, P<0.05). As compared to Sup-B15 cells, the transcription of ALDH1 in Sup-B15/shVEC was remarkably downregulated, and the CD133 protein level was also downregulated in Sup-B15/shVEC cells. Both cytoplasmic and nucleic β-catenin protein levels (but not for Bcr-abl levels) decreased in Sup-B15/shVEC cells as compare to Sup-B15 cells.Knockdown of CD144 sensitized Sup-B15 Ph+ ALL cells to IM. The possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be via inhibiting β-catenin nucleic translocation and facilitating β-catenin degradation.",

        "abstract": "A tungsten tip and an iron-coated tungsten tip were used to investigate cobalt phthalocyanine molecules absorbed on a Au(111) surface. Similar STM images but different STS curves were obtained above the central part of the molecules. Theoretical analysis points out that the delocalized orbital of ligands hybridized with the Au surface at 0.4 eV below Fermi level can be detected and enhanced with an iron-coated tungsten tip due to the extended spatial distribution of the frontier orbital in the tip. As the spatial distribution of the frontier orbital in the tungsten tip is localized, the hybrid state cannot be detected above the central part of the molecule. These results indicate that the appropriateness of selection and preparation of the STM tip can probe richer chemistry and physics on surfaces. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The quality and grade of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were assessed by their characteristics traditionally. According to traditional experience, the quality of the purple Flos Farfarae is better than that of yellow buds. NMR-based metabolomic approach combined with significant analysis of microarray (SAM) and Spearman rank correlation analysis were used to investigate the different metabolites of the Flos Farfarae with different color feature. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear distinction between the purple and yellow flower buds of Tussilago farfara. The S-plot of orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) and t test revealed that the levels of threonine, proline, phosphatidylcholine, creatinine, 4, 5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, rutin, caffeic acid, kaempferol analogues, and tussilagone were higher in the purple flower buds than that in the yellow buds, in agreement with the results of SAM and Spearman rank correlation analysis. The results confirmed the traditional medication experience that \"purple flower bud is better than the yellow ones\", and provide a scientific basis for assessing the quality of Flos Farfarae by the color features.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the antipyretic effect of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium based on GC-MS metabolomics and explore its mechanism. Methods: Rats were randomly divided into control, model, high-, mid-, low-dose B. scorzonerifolium extract (40, 20, and 10 g/kg), and Aspirin (100 mg/kg) positive control groups. The fever rats induced by yeast were administered twice. The body temperature changes of rats were observed at the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th hours after modeling; Meanwhile, plasma samples were collected at the 10th hour and subjected to GC-MS analysis to find potential biomarkers of fever. Results: Aspirin showed antipyretic effect well. The temperature showed no significant difference compared with the control group 2 h after administration (P > 0.05). Different doses of extract from B. scorzonerifolium showed the antipyretic effect at varying degrees, which presented the obvious dose-dependent antipyretic effect. The high-dose group had a faster onset, and there was a significant difference (P < 0.01) 1 h after the first administration compared with the model group. The mid-dose group achieved the best antipyretic effect 1 h after the second administration, and there was no significant difference compared with the normal group (P > 0.05). Compared with the model group, low-dose group showed no significant differences at each time point. The body temperature showed a large fluctuation, indicating the drugs could interfere with the increase of body temperature but did not reach a significant antipyretic effect. Seventeen potential biomarkers were identified from the loading plot based on the metabolomics and the different doses of B. scorzonerifolium extract could regulate the biomarkers. Conclusion: B. scorzonerifolium has the significant antipyretic effect in a dose-dependent manner and the antipyretic role may be related to the synergism of enzyme inhibition, neurotransmitter, glucose and lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism with the multi-targets.",

In Europe, the plant has been used as herbal remedies for virtually the same applications, but the leaves are preferred over flowers.To systematically evaluate the chemical profiles of Tusssilago farfara leaves and flowers along with the identification of the polar and non-polar metabolites.Metabolic profiling carried out by means of ¹H-NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was applied to crude extracts from flowers and leaves. Metabolites were identified directly from the crude extracts through one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra.A broad range of metabolites were detected without any chromatographic separation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of ¹H-NMR data provided a clear separation between the samples. The corresponding loadings plot indicated that higher levels of phenylpropanoids, amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids, as well as lower levels of sugars, terpenoids and sterols were present in the leaves, as compared with flowers. For the flowers, more phenylpropanoids were present in fully open flowers, while more sugars and fatty acids were present in flower buds.NMR spectra (one- and two-dimensional) are useful for identifying metabolites, especially for the overlapped signals. The NMR-based metabolomics approach has great potential for chemical comparison study of the metabolome of herbal drugs.",

METHODS:The expression of VEGF165b of SMMC-7721 was detective by RT-PCR and Western Blotting after treated with endostar. After transfected with VEGF165b,the expression of HIF-1α and its downstream target genes VEGFA was analyzed by RT-PCR and Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. SMMC-7721 cell was transfected with VEGF165b or empty vector,and then treated with endostar,the cell growth inhibiting rate was detected by methly thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). RESULTS:High dose endostar at 100 and 400 μg/mL up-regulated the expression of VEGF165b,while VEGF165b suppressed the expression of HIF-1α and its downstream target genes VEGFA. After transfection with empty-vector,treatment of SMMC-7721 cell with 500 and 1 000 μg/mL endostar induced the tumour cell growth inhibiting rate at 1.6% and 0.4% individually. After transfection with VEGF165b,treatment of SMMC-7721 cell with 500 and 1 000 μg/mL endostar induced the tumour cell growth inhibiting rate at 8.5% (P=0.000 0) and 20.2%( P=0.000 0) individually. CONCLUSIONS:Endostar can inhibite tumour growth and anti-angiogenisis partly via VEGF165b,and VEGF165b sensitize the tumour cell to endostar. VEGF165b and endostar have synergistic effect on tumor suppression.",

Among them, compound 5a6 (EC₅₀=0.022 ± 0.0091 μM, SI >10,770) was confirmed to be the most potent and selective inhibitor, which proved more potent than DDI and DLV in a cell-based assay against wt HIV-1, and more efficient than NVP in an RT (reverse transcriptase) assay. Besides, it is worth noting that compound 7a1 retained moderate inhibitory activity (EC₅₀=4.8 ± 0.95 μM) against the HIV-1 double RT mutant strain (K103N/Y181C).

The emergence of such a new structural motif turns out to be a result of the subtle balance between Cu-C and Cu-Cu interactions. Based on this picture, a simple theoretical model is proposed, which describes a variety of surface chemistries very well.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxia-induced radioresistance has been well known as the main obstacle in cancer radiotherapy. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) was previously demonstrated to play an important role in hypoxia-induced biological behaviors, such as metastasis and angiogenesis, through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which is an important contributing factor to radioresistance in tumor cells. However, how LOX plays a role in hypoxia-induced radioresistance has yet to be determined. Here, we found that LOX expression was in accordance with HIF-1α expression, and LOX expression at the mRNA and protein level, and enzymatic activity were remarkably upregulated in the hypoxic A549 cells, compared with normoxic A549 cells. Inhibition of LOX resulted in the reduction of the ability to repair double-stranded breaks (DSBs), promotion of apoptosis, relief of G2/M cycle arrest, and eventually reduction of hypoxia-induced radioresistance in the hypoxic A549 cells. This suggests that LOX may play an important role in hypoxia-induced radioresistance. Together, our results might suggest a novel potential therapeutic target in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",

The damaged shoots,the sister shoots (the opposite),the systematic upper shoots (above the damaged shoots) and the systematic lower shoots (under the damaged shoots) were sampled after being injured by the insects,being treated by the MeJA and the terpenes for 4 hours. Results showed that different modes of damage considerably and systematically caused the changes of GABA and 17 free amino acids in P. massioniana seedlings. Contents of GABA increased distinctly in the shoots damaged by the insect,treated with MeJA (10 μmol\\5L-1 ) and terpenes (10μmol\\5L-1 ),and in their sister shoots and the systematic shoots. The total contents of amino acids decreased in the leaves of the shoots chewed by the insect and treated with MeJA (10 μmol·L-1 ),and of the sister shoots and the systematic shoots. The total contents of amino acids decreased in the shoots treated with terpenes (10 μmol·L -1 ) and the systematic lower shoots,however,increased in the sister shoots and the systematic upper shoots. It was concluded that MeJA and terpenes induced the similar defensive systems as the insect did,and could replace the insect to signal and initial the defensive system to defend against the outer attack.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant human endostatin (rh-endostatin), a potential antiangiogenic agent, is used in non-small cell lung carcinoma treatment\n and represses vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) levels in tumor cell. However, precise affection of rh-endostatin\n on the proangiogenic VEGF isoforms (VEGF165) or antiangiogenic VEGF isoforms (VEGF165b) is not clear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that rh-endostatin could alter expression of these isoforms to regulate\n tumor growth. A549 cells were exposed to rh-endostatin, and the expression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b was detected. The role of SP1 as a regulator of isoform expression was investigated. We then examined the anticancer and\n antiangiogenic efficacy of rh-endostatin in combination with exogenous VEGF165b against A549 cells, EA.HY 926 cells and xenograft model of human lung cancer. rh-Endostatin reduced VEGF165 and induced VEGF165b as well as inhibited SP1 in A549 cells. SP1 inhibitor (betulinic acid) also developed those changes. VEGF165b–rh-endostatin combination was highly synergistic and inhibited growth, survival, and migration of A549 cells, VEGF-mediated\n VEGFR2 phosphorylation in EA.HY 926 cells, and tumor growth in xenograft model of human lung cancer. rh-Endostatin downregulates\n proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) isoform and upregulates antiangiogenic VEGFA isoform, possibly\n through inhibition of SP1. Furthermore, VEGF165b sensitizes A549 to rh-endostatin treatment and enhances the anticancer effect of rh-endostatin.",

        "abstract": "The imagery of highly squinted synthetic aperture radar mounted on maneuvering platforms with nonlinear trajectory is a challenging task due to the existence of acceleration and the cross-range-dependent range migration and Doppler parameters. In order to accommodate these issues, a frequency-domain imaging algorithm based on tandem two-step nonlinear chirp scaling (TNCS) with small aperture is proposed. For the cross-range-dependent range cell migration (RCM) caused by the linear range walk correction and acceleration, the first-step NCS is introduced to suppress this dependence and realize the unified RCM correction. Based on the differences between full-aperture and small-aperture data in the cross-range processing, the second-step NCS is introduced in frequency domain to equalize the cross-range-dependent Doppler parameters, for cross-range processing is more sensitive to the cross-range dependence than range processing. Furthermore, a novel geometric correction method based on inverse projection is utilized to eliminate the negative effects caused by the imaging processing. Simulation results and real data processing are presented to validate the proposed approach.",

However, the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs are not always successfully achieved in some animal models, and this deficiency may be caused in part by poor homing of these cells to hematopoietic tissues. In this study, we assessed the immunsuppressive capacity of lentiviral vector transduced MSCs expressing CXCR4 in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched mouse model of bone marrow (BM) transplantation from C57BL/6 donors to BALB/c recipients. The survival, body weight and clinical score of GVHD in transplanted mice were monitored. Liver, intestine and skin from mice in each group were obtained for histological examination. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-17A were also determined using a Cytometric Bead Array. CXCR4 over-expressing MSCs maintained their immunsuppressive capacity and showed enhanced migration capacity in vitro. In the mouse GVHD model, treatment with CXCR4 over-expressing MSCs decreased the mortality rate and attenuated clinical and pathological GVHD scores. Moreover, compared with control groups, the plasma IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in recipients infused with CXCR4 over-expressing MSCs were significantly decreased, while those of IL-4 and IL-10 were increased. In conclusion, our report reveals that CXCR4-transduced MSCs effectively controlled the occurrence of mouse GVHD following allogeneic BM transplantation.",

To check the effects of molecular size, geometrical symmetry and edge functionalization of nanographenes on their optical properties, a series of nanographenes is studied in the framework of density functional theory with the B3LYP functional. Our results indicate that edge functionalization remarkably changes the nonlinear optical properties and increases the anisotropy of nanographenes compared to the effects of the molecular size and system geometric symmetry. Furthermore, the nonlinear optical properties of nanographenes can be tuned by precise edge functionalization, which opens a new avenue for using nanographenes as nonlinear optical materials.",

In this respect, the distance for sunlight and building orientation have become important factors to consider. Presently, regulations for the design of residential housing do not take into account the differences between the city centre and suburb regions, resulting in an urban fabric that is both disintegrated and disordered. In order to maintain the identity of the city space, we take references from European urban developments, borrowing from their experiences and lessons learnt. The paper suggests the possibility of a different design regulation that is specific to the city centre, through restricting building height and plot ratio, increasing building density and relaxing existing regulations on building orientation and the sunlight rule.",

        "abstract": "Beany flavor is a traditional sensory indicator for evaluating the quality of Radix Astragali (RA or \"Huangqi\" in Chinese). A RA root with a strong beany flavor is considered to be good quality in Chinese medicine. However, there is neither a study reporting volatile compounds contributing to RA beany flavor nor the relevance between beany flavor and the quality of RA. In this study, we assessed the quantification of beany flavor substance and main bioactive metabolites. The results showed that hexanal was a major volatile component contributing to the beany flavor in RA. The value of hexanal was significantly related to the origin and growth age of RA, indicating that the component could be used as a volatile indicator for the distinction of RA. Statistical analysis further demonstrated that hexanal, astragaloside IV, and total polysaccharides were primary indicators and total isoflavonoids, astragalosides, calycosin, and formononetin were the secondary indicators for quality control of RA. Correlation analysis showed that the level of hexanal was positively associated with the concentration of astragaloside IV and total polysaccharides. Our study demonstrated that aroma is one of the most important quality attributes of RA and will help to understand the role of aroma in quality assessment of traditional Chinese medicines.",

        "abstract": "A high dose of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is widely used to mobilize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), but G-CSF is relatively inefficient and may cause adverse effects. Recently, adrenaline has been found to play important roles in HSPC mobilization. In this study, we explored whether adrenaline combined with G-CSF could induce HSPC mobilization in a mouse model. Mice were treated with adrenaline and either a high or low dose of G-CSF alone or in combination. Peripheral blood HSPC counts were evaluated by flow cytometry. Levels of bone marrow SDF-1 were measured by ELISA, the transcription of CXCR4 and SDF-1 was measured by real-time RT-PCR, and CXCR4 protein was detected by Western blot. Our results showed that adrenaline alone fails to mobilize HSPCs into the peripheral blood; however, when G-CSF and adrenaline are combined, the WBC counts and percentages of HSPCs are significantly higher compared to those in mice that received G-CSF alone. The combined use of adrenaline and G-CSF not only accelerated HSPC mobilization, but also enabled the efficient mobilization of HSPCs into the peripheral blood at lower doses of G-CSF. Adrenaline/G-CSF treatment also extensively downregulated levels of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in mouse bone marrow. These results demonstrated that adrenaline combined with G-CSF can induce HSPC mobilization by down-regulating the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis, indicating that the use of adrenaline may enable the use of reduced dosages or durations of G-CSF treatment, minimizing G-CSF-associated complications.",

        "abstract": "\nAntithymocyte globulin (ATG) combined with cyclosporine A (CsA) has been widely used as a standard regimen in the treatment of aplastic anemia (AA), especially in severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Abnormally activated T cells might be the immune pathogenesis of AA. T cell immune response cDNA 7 (TIRC7) has been demonstrated its essential role in T cell activation; however, little is known about the role of TIRC7 in AA. In this study, we documented that TIRC7 levels in CsA group were higher than that in ATG + CsA (AC) group only in the follow-up phase (P < 0.05; P < 0.05); nevertheless, TIRC7 levels in SAA group were elevated than non severe aplastic anemia group not only in the treatment phase (P < 0.05; P < 0.05) but also in the follow-up phase (P < 0.05; P < 0.01). The trend of changes of T helper (Th) 1, Th17 and Th22 levels before and after treatment was similar to the changes of TIRC7 levels in either AC group or CsA group. Thus, TIRC7 might be involved in the pathogenesis of AA and AC might down-regulate Th1 cells by modulating the expression of TIRC7 in AA.",

The electronic energetics upon hydrogenation is identified, enabling a greater understanding of interfacial and intra-molecular charge transportation in the field of single-molecule electronics.",

        "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising candidate for cellular therapies. Co-transplantation of MSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) promotes successful engraftment and improves hematopoietic recovery. In this study, the effects of co-transplantation of HSCs and mouse bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs overexpressing CXCR4 (CXCR4-MSC) on CXCR4-MSC homing capacity and the reconstitution potential in lethally irradiated mice were evaluated. Recovery of donor-derived peripheral blood leukocytes and platelets was accelerated when CXCR4-MSCs were co-transplanted with BM cells. The frequency of c-kit(+)Sca(+)Lin(-) HSCs was higher in recipient BM following co-transplantation of CXCR4-MSCs compared with the EGFP-MSC control and the BMT only groups. Surprisingly, the rate of early engraftment of donor-derived BM cells in recipients co-transplanted with CXCR4-MSCs was slightly lower than in the absence of MSCs on day 7. Moreover, co-transplantation of CXCR4-MSCs regulated the balance of T helper cells subsets. Hematopoietic tissue reconstitution was evaluated by histopathological analysis of BM and spleen. Co-transplantation of CXCR4-MSCs was shown to promote the recovery of hematopoietic organs. These findings indicate that co-transplantation of CXCR4-MSCs promotes the early phase of hematopoietic recovery and sustained hematopoiesis.",

        "abstract": "Objective To explore the different expression of NF-kB in both K562 and its multidrug resistant cell line K562/A02 and discuss the mechanism of multidrug resistance(MDR). Methods To detect the growing feature of the cells. Flow cytometry was used to analys the difference between the distribution profile of K562/S and K562/A02 cell. MTT colorimetry was used to determine the cytotoxic effect of adramycin, and expression of mdrl gene was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase poly-merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in K562 and K562/A02 cells. FACS was used to determine the expression and function of glycoprotein (P-gp) on the cell membrane. Western blotting was used to determine the NF-κB p65 protein in nucleus. Results There was a difference between K562 and K562/A02 cells growed in a half- adherent way rather than suspending ones, there were increases in the percentage number of cells at G0/G1, and S phases (P <0.05). This was mirrored by a decreasing number of cells within the G2/M phase (P <0.05). But there was no difference in apoptosis rate(P >0.05). mdrl mRNA was detected in K562/A02 cells, in which the expression P-gp was much higher [(94.17 ±0.89)% -(1.41 ±0.491)%]. NF-κB p65 protein in nucleus was overexpressed in K562/A02 cells. Conclusion The activation of NF-κB signaling pathway may attribute to the formation of MDR in K562/A02 cells.",

        "abstract": "Vinorelbine (VIN) is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid and is one of the most active agents for the treatment of solid tumors. The drug is commonly administered through a peripheral vein. Although VIN is known to cause local venous toxicity, such as drug-induced phlebitis, the mechanism responsible for the toxicity remains unclear. To investigate the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in VIN-induced vascular endothelial injury, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were prepared from umbilical cords recovered with the written informed consent of the parents and treated with VIN for 60 min. Following the washing away of the VIN, the cells were cultured for a further 6 and 12 h, and the changes in TLR4 expression in the HUVECs were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Finally, the effects of VIN on the translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) were determined by immunofluorescence and confocal analysis. The VIN-treated cells were stretched, extended and irregular while the control cells exhibited normal morphology. The TLR4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in the VIN-treated HUVECs than those in the control group (P<0.05). The rate of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation in the VIN-treated HUVECs was significantly higher than that in the vehicle-treated group (P<0.05). These results indicated that TLR4 is involved in the development of VIN-induced vascular endothelial injury by affecting the translocation of NF-κB.",

        "abstract": "It is highly desirable to reach a high carrier mobility in two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals with a modest band gap for electronic applications. In this study, two 2D semiconducting materials, penta-PdX2 (X = P, As), are found to be promising candidates to approach this goal. Both penta-PdP2 and penta-PdAs2 have a band gap of about 0.7–0.8 eV. Their carrier mobility is up to 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes, among the highest in 2D semiconductors. Moreover, the effective mass and band gap can be effectively tuned by applying a biaxial strain. The electron effective mass climbs up firstly and then largely declines under tensile load with a turning point at 5% for penta-PdP2 and 2% for penta-PdAs2. Furthermore, penta-PdX2 monolayers exhibit strong optical absorption in a wide wavelength range. All these outstanding properties render penta-PdX2 promising candidates for ultra-fast electronic and optoelectronic applications.",

In this article, we investigated the role and the mechanisms of miR-15a/16 in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). We found that miR-15a/16 was down-regulated in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of newly diagnosed patients with MM and the downregulation of miR-15a/16 was correlated with International Staging System (ISS) stage. We then demonstrated miR-15a/16 inhibited myeloma cells proliferation, and increased apoptosis rate of U266 cells by suppressing the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. We also found miR-15a/16 could decrease VEGF-A and IL-17 levels in the supernatant of myeloma cells. These results indicate that miR-15a/16 may function as a tumor suppressor in MM through multiple regulatory mechanisms and they may be potential targets for the therapy of MM.",

The acquired Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) K607N somatic mutation was detected in about 6.8% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. However, roles of JAK2 K607N mutation in the leukemogenesis of AML remain unclear. In this study, loss of interaction between K607 and E877 was identified as key reasons for JAK2 K607N mutation constitutive activation. JAK2 K607N and mutations (K607A, K607G and E877A) abolished the K607 and E877 interaction caused JAK2 constitutive activation. While, mutations (K607R, E877D) repairing this interaction reduced K607N mutation's activity. Furthermore, our studies showed that disruption of K607 and E877 interaction abolished JH1/JH2 domains' interactions and led to JAK2 constitutive activation. More importantly, JAK2 K607N and mutations disrupted this interaction enhanced JAK2-STAT5 pathway activation and the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Thus our studies provide clues in understanding the leukemogenesis of JAK2 K607N mutation in AML.",

        "abstract": "Our first principles calculations reveal that an oxidative cut of graphene is realized by forming epoxy and then carbonyl pairs. Direct formation of a carbonyl pair to tear graphene up from an edge position is not favorable in energy. This atomic picture is valuable for developing effective means of graphene manipulation. The proposed epoxy pairs may be related to some long puzzling experimental observations on graphene oxide.",

        "abstract": "To construct mouse CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (Cxcr4) gene overexpressing lentiviral vector and to evaluate its biological effect on mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).Cxcr4 gene was amplified and subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector. Cxcr4 gene and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene expressed bicistronic recombinant lentiviral vector LV-CXCR4-IRES-EGFP and control vector LV-IRES-EGFP were constructed, respectively. Both plasmids were co-transfected into 293FT packaging cell line with packaging plasmid pSPAX2 and enveloping plasmid pMD.2G using Lipofectamine 2000 to produce lentiviral virus, respectively. The recombinant viruses were harvested and the virus titer was determined by limiting dilution. Mouse MSCs were infected with viral supernatant. EGFP expression was visualized using fluorescence microscope and efficiency of infection was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was applied in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to evaluate the suppressive effect of MSCs on mice splenocyte proliferation in vitro. Wound healing ability of MSCs was measured by scratch experiment and migration capacity by a chemotaxis assay using a transwell assay.The Cxcr4 fragment was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and verified by DNA sequencing. The restriction enzyme digestion experiment demonstrated that the recombinant lentiviral vector LV-CXCR4-IRES-EGFP and the control vector LV-IRES-EGFP were successfully constructed. Expression of CXCR4 was detected by fluorescence microscopy, which indicated that the lentiviral particles expressing CXCR4 were packaged. Furthermore, expression of EGFP were detected by fluorescence microscopy in MSCs after infection and the expression of CXCR4 protein on MSCs surface in CXCR4-MSC group was significantly increased comparing to those in the control group(P < 0.05).CXCR4-MSCs group and the control group were (90.3 ± 3.37)% and (1.53 ± 0.34)%, respectively. Meanwhile, overexpression of CXCR4 had no effect on their capacity of immune regulation when co-cultured with splenocyte(P > 0.05). Moreover, overexpression of CXCR4 can not only accelerated the wound healing after scratch, but also enhanced the migration ability of cells in the transwell induced by high concentration of SDF-1 in a dose-dependent manner compared with the EGFP control group.The CXCR4 expressing lentiviral vector LV-CXCR4-IRES-EGFP was successfully constructed. The lentiviral vector can not only efficiently infect mouse MSCs, but also stably express CXCR4 in MSCs. The MSCs modified with CXCR4 have biological characteristic in vitro.Abstract available from the publisher.",

        "abstract": "Pristine SnO2 and Al-doped SnO2 composite nanofibers, with several dopants concentrations, have been fabricated via electrospinning technique and subsequent calcination procedure. The morphology, structure, and composition of the as-prepared nanofibers are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), respectively. XRD analysis indicates Al-SnO2 metastable solid solution is formed at the low concentrations, while the Al 2O3-SnO2 heterojunction structures can be obtained at high concentrations. Comparing with the pristine SnO2 nanofibers, Al-doped SnO2 composite nanofibers show improved hydrogen sensing properties, with the Al-SnO2 metastable solid solution having the best performances, such as higher sensitivity and rapid response (∼3 s) and recovery (less than 2 s). Effects of the changes of SnO 2 crystal, causing by the induction of Al, on the sensing performance have been discussed. We believe this paper can construct a powerful platform to understand and design the practical gas sensor in future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

GVHD model was established with C57BL/6(H-2b) donor mice and BALB/c (H-2d) recipient mice. After irradiation, recipients were injected with donor bone marrow and spleen cells along with CCR7-modified dendritic cells. Mice were randomized into irradiation, transplant control, pXZ9-imDC (empty vector control) and CCR7-imDC groups. Survival, GVHD score, histopathological analysis and plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines were observed.The mean survival in irradiation, transplantation, pXZ9-imDC and CCR7-imDC groups were (8.20±1.48)d, (12.20±2.78)d, (20.70±6.01)d and (27.5±7.55)d respectively. The survival in CCR7- imDC group was significantly improved compared with other groups (P<0.05). GVHD scores in transplantation, pXZ9-imDC and CCR7-imDC groups were (6.90±1.66), (5.60±0.97) and (4.10±1.79) respectively. CCR7-imDC group had significantly lower GVHD score and minor tissue damages shown by histopathological analysis than the other groups. Plasma IFN-γ level increased and reached the peak at +10 day in transplant group, while it gradually decreased in pXZ9-imDC and CCR7-imDC groups, and then reached the nadir at +20 day post-allo-BMT, with the lowest level in CCR7-imDC group (P<0.01). Plasma IL-4 decreased in transplant group, while it gradually increased in pXZ9-imDC and CCR7-imDC groups and reached the highest level at + 10 day in CCR7- imDC group (P<0.01). The 95%-100% of H-2b positive cells in recipient mice on + 30 day post-allo-BMT demonstrated the complete donor- type implantation.Genetically modified immature DC by CCR7 gene could alleviate damages by GVHD and prolong survival of recipient mice after allo-BMT.",

        "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients, but acquired resistance limit the efficiency of this treatment. As a homeostatic cellular recycling mechanism, autophagy has been proposed to participate in the EGFR-TKI resistance. However, the role of autophagy in lung cancer treatment and the underlying mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, we found the sensitivity to erlotinib, a well-used EGFR-TKI, was correlated with basal autophagy level. Erlotinib was able to induce autophagy not only in TKI-sensitive, but also TKI-resistant cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of erlotinib in TKI-resistant cancer cells via modulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced apoptosis. In this process, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) acted as an executioner. Downregulation of CHOP with siRNA blocked the autophagy inhibition and erlotinib co-treatment induced apoptosis and prevented cancer cells from this co-treatment-induced cell death. Our findings suggest that autophagy inhibition overcomes erlotinib resistance through modulation of ER stress mediated apoptosis. ",

The external field reduces the energy gap of BNNT, thus makes the molecular bands closer to the BNNT band edges and enhances the charge transfers between BNNT and molecules. The effects of the electric field direction on the band structure are negligible. The electric field shielding effect of BNNT to the inside organic molecules is discussed. Organic molecule doping strongly modifies the optical property of BNNT, and the absorption edge is redshifted under static transverse electric field.",

Some conclusions can be drawn for Astragali Radix: the major source is the cultivated Astragalus mongolicus. The new major cultivation areas for A. mongolicus and A. membranaceus are Shandong and Gansu province. The semi-wildly planting model in Shanxi province maintains the genuine trait of Astragali Radix, but its yield is limited, and now a combination model has been developed. The major problems for Astragali Radix are the selection of planting sites, the rot root and difficulty in collecting and processing. Several developmental proposals for Astragali Radix were put forward including rational distribution of planting areas, establishment of standard system, development and standardization of producing technologies.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes after shRNA mediated BTLA gene silence. METHODS: Three specific shRNAs and one nonspecific shRNA (scrambled) were ligated to pSilencer3.1-H1-neo plasmid and then subcloned into lentiviral vector pLB. Recombinant viral particles were harvested post-transduction to 293T cells. Mouse lymphocytes were infected with viral supernatant after 24 h incubation and continuously cultured till 4 days. Expression of eGFP was detected by fluorescence microscopy, efficiency of infection and expression of BTLA on lymphocyte cell by FCM. CCK-8 assay was used to detect the proliferation of lymphocytes. RESULTS: Lentiviral expression vectors pLB-shRNA/BTLA were successfully generated. The lentiviral particles were correctly packaged. Expression of BTLA protein in specific shRNA group was significantly decreased comparing to those in control group. O.D. value at A(450) of lymphocytes stimulated by anti-CD3 antibody showed significant difference compared with normal BTLA group (P < 0.05), while there was no difference between ConA stimulated group and control (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Gene-specific shRNA can knockdown the expression of BTLA. The proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated by anti-CD3 antibody after RNAi demonstrates significant enhancement as compared to the unstimulated lymphocytes, while stimulated by ConA showed no difference compared to normal lymphocytes.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of density functional theory, stability and electronic structure of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in surface modified diamond have been studied. Surface decoration is traditionally expected to only have influence on those NV centers close to the surface. However, our calculations indicate that its effect to charged NV centers is nondecaying and long-range, where the formation energy of the charged NV center converges to a value typically different for different types of surface decoration. Such a nondecaying long range effect is due to the electrostatic potential shift induced by the surface dipole layer, and it leads to the preference of NV(-) center for oxygen saturated diamond and NV(0) for hydrogenated one. Our work demonstrates that surface functionalization can be used to modify the relative stabilities of differently charged defects in nonmetallic materials.",

Digital-PCR (dPCR) can be applied to detect the  gene with high sensitivity. In the present study, the results of the Clarity™ dPCR system were compared with those of the RT-qPCR in order to determine whether dPCR can be applied in the clinical setting. A total of 83 patients were included in the present study, and they were divided into two groups according to the results of   during ongoing monitoring. A total of 43 patients with undetectable   where enrolled in group A.  testing was performed using the dPCR system on the same peripheral blood samples of patients from group A, and the association between dPCR results and relapse was analyzed. The RT-qPCR platform and dPCR system were used simultaneously to detect the  gene of another 40 patients who achieved either partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) or further response. Among patients with undetectable  , patients with dPCR-positive disease ( >0.1%) were more likely to undergo molecular relapse (P=0.018). The results of dPCR detection of % were consistent with the RT-qPCR results (R=0.9510) in patients who achieved PCyR or further response. For samples with   <1.0%, the consistency of the dPCR and RT-qPCR results was better than that of   >1.0% (R=0.9488 vs. R=0.9264 for  ). The detection results of the  gene in patients with CML using dPCR matched well with those from the RT-qPCR. To conclude, the results of the dPCR system can be applied as a supplement to the RT-qPCR platform, particularly for those with   <1.0%.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate if recombinant Trichinella spiralis-53 000 protein (rTsP53) could alleviate liver damage caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) via M2 macrophage activation.Sixty male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into LPS group, LPS + phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group and rTsP53 intervention group by random number table, with 20 mice in each group. Intraperitoneal injection of 15 μg/kg LPS was performed for all the mice in the three groups after 8 hours of fasting. The mice in LPS + PBS group were injected with PBS after 1 hour of LPS injection. The mice in the rTsP53 intervention group were injected with rTsP53 (5 mg/kg) after 1 hour of LPS injection. After 48 hours all the mice were sacrificed. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested and flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect markers CCR7 (M1) and CD206 (M2) of macrophages. Hepatic tissue was harvested for pathological study after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and double staining immunofluorescence was used to detect F4/80⁺ HLA-DR⁺ and F4/80⁺ CD163⁺. Peripheral blood serum was harvested to detect the levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT).Compared with LPS and LPS + PBS groups, survival rate of mice of rTsP53 intervention group was significantly elevated (90% vs. 25%, 30%, both P<0.01), and the pathological injury of the liver was significantly ameliorated, and the hepatic structure was better preserved. The transaminase in rTsP53 intervention group was significantly lower than that of LPS and LPS + PBS groups (ALT: 97.7 ± 8.5 U/L vs. 181.7 ± 19.5 U/L, 173.7 ± 17.2 U/L; AST: 142.7 ± 12.1 U/L vs. 235.7 ± 9.9 U/L, 213.7 ± 6.7 U/L, all P<0.05), FITC-CD206⁺ proportion of peritoneal macrophage was significantly higher [(17.75 ± 0.30)% vs. (1.38 ± 0.13)%, (1.36 ± 0.05)%, both P<0.05] while PE-CCR7(+) proportion [(6.89 ± 0.11)% vs. (15.30 ± 0.64)%, (14.96 ± 0.93)%, both P<0.05] was significantly lower. Fluorescence intensity of macrophages with F4/80⁺ CD163⁺ double staining for liver sections was significantly increased (0.36 ± 0.01 vs. 0.29 ± 0.02, 0.31 ± 0.01, both P<0.05), while there was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of macrophages with F4/80⁺ HLA-DR⁺ double staining (0.30 ± 0.01 vs. 0.30 ± 0.02, 0.31 ±0.01, both P>0.05). There was no significant difference of above results between LPS group and LPS + PBS group (all P>0.05).rTsP53 could ameliorate liver damage caused by LPS and improve animal's survival via the activation of M2 macrophage.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Th17 cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral blood of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and to clarify the role of the Th17/Treg cell ratio imbalance in pathogenesis of ITP. Patients were divided into the pre-treatment group (active group) (n = 38) and post-treatment group (remission group) according to the platelet count and curative effect. Post-treatment group was further divided into remission group (n = 24), partial remission group (n = 10), and non-remission group (n = 4). 30 healthy subjects were enrolled in control group. Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of peripheral blood Th17 cells and Treg cells in CD4(+) T cells from ITP patients and controls respectively. The results showed that the percentages of Th17 cells in active group and non-remission group were significantly higher than those in control group (p < 0.05). The percentages of Th17 cells in remission group, partial-remission group were also higher than those in control group, but there were no statistically significant differences between these groups. The percentage of Th17 cells in remission group was lower than that in active group, but there was also no statistically difference between two groups. The percentages of Treg cells in active group, partial-remission group and non-remission group significantly decreased, compared with in control group (p < 0.01). The percentage of Treg cells in remission group was lower than that in control group, but there was no statistically significant difference. The ratio of peripheral blood Th17/Treg cells in active group, partial-remission group and non-remission group was higher, as compared with in control group. The ratio of peripheral blood Th17/Treg cells in remission group was higher than that in control group, but there was no statistically difference between two groups. It is concluded the percentage of Th17 cells and the ratio of Th17/Treg cells are higher in active group. The percentage of Treg cells is low in active group, partial remission and non-remission groups. The imbalance of Th17/Treg ratio may play a critical role in ITP pathogenesis.",

        "title": "Electrospun palladium (IV)-doped copper oxide composite nanofibers for non-enzymatic glucose sensors",
        "abstract": "Pd (IV)-doped CuO oxide composite nanofibers (PCNFs) have been successfully fabricated via electrospinning and then employed to construct an amperometric non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The PCNFs based glucose sensors display distinctly enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose, showing significantly lower overvoltage (0.32 V) and ultrafast (1 s) and ultrasensitive current (1061.4 μA mM −1 cm −2 ) response with a lower detection limit of 1.9 × 10 −8 M (S/N = 3). Additionally, excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability have also been obtained. These results indicate that PCNFs are promising candidates for amperometric non-enzymatic glucose detection. Keywords Electrospinning Copper oxide Doped Non-enzymatic Glucose sensor 1 Introduction The past several decades have witnessed the big progress on fabricating sensitive devices for fast and reliable monitoring glucose and carbohydrates driven by their practical applications in treating and controlling diabetes [1,2] . Among those devices, amperometric glucose biosensors with glucose oxidase (GO x ) [3] and without GOx [4] have been the subject of considerable interest because a low detection limit can be achieved easily. Especially, the enzymeless glucose sensors have gained special focus taking the advantages of good stability, simplicity, reproducibility and so on [5] . Recently, bimetallic materials are of particular interest for non-enzymatic glucose detection owing to the improved electrocatalytic ability of pure metal anodes occurs as a consequence of the introduction of the other elements [6–8] . However, at nano-scale, these metallic nanomaterials based electrodes usually suffer from the stable problems (easy oxidization or poisoning) or high cost, which hinders their practical applications [9,10] . On the other hand, oxides based glucose sensors have been widely investigated for non-enzymatic detecting owing to their good stability [11,12] . Prompted by the high electrocatalytic ability of pure metallic nanomaterials and the good stability of oxides, in this communication, we demonstrate a novel type of ultrasensitive and stable enzymeless glucose sensor based on bimetal oxides of palladium-doped copper oxide composite nanofibers (PCNFs) via electrospinning [13] . Ultrafast response with a lower detection limit at a lower applied potential can be obtained based on our sensor. 2 Experimental d -Glucose, cupric acetate, palladium chloride, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, M w = 70,000–75,000), NaOH and ethylene glycol were purchased from Beijing Chemical Co. (China). Uric acid (UA), l -ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), Triton-X100 and Nafion (Nf) (v/v, 5%) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification. Distilled water was used in all experiments. PCNFs were fabricated through electrospinning and followed by calcination. In a typical procedure [14] , 0.4 g of cupric acetate and 0.02 g palladium chloride were added slowly into 7.6 g of a PVA solution (7.9 wt.%) with 0.01 g of Triton-X100. Then, the solution was kept under vigorous magnetic stirring for 12 h, and a viscous gel was obtained. Finally, the as-prepared gel was loaded into a syringe and connected to a high-voltage power supply for electrospinning. An electric potential of 15 kV was applied between the orifice and the ground at a distance of 20 cm. Then, calcination (500 °C in air for 5 h) was used to treat the as-spun composite fibers to remove the organic constituents of PVA and to convert the precursor into PCNFs. The modified electrode was prepared as follows: glassy carbon (GC) electrodes (3 mm diameter) were carefully polished with a diamond pad/3 μm polishing suspension, rinsed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried under ambient nitrogen gas. The as-prepared nanofibers (1 mg) were dissolved in 200 μL ethylene glycol. After ultrasonication (2 min), uniformly dispersed PCNFs were obtained. After dipping 5 μL PCNFs solution onto the electrode surface, the electrode was dried at 80 °C. Subsequently, 5 μL Nafion (Nf) (v/v, 1%) solution was dropped onto the modified electrode to form a film. The crystal structures of the products were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens D5005, Munich, Germany). Analysis of the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed on an ESCLABMKII using Mg as excitation source. The morphologies of the electrospun nanofibers were viewed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SHIMADZU SSX-550, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy observations (TEM, Model JEM-2000EX, JEOL) were performed with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. All electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China) with a conventional three-electrode system composed of a platinum auxiliary, a saturated calomel electrode reference (SCE), and modified glassy carbon working electrodes. All electrochemical experiments were performed in 0.1 M NaOH solutions (5 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Glucose concentration was controlled by adding desired concentration of glucose into the NaOH solution. 3 Results and discussion SEM has been used to characterize the morphologies of pure CuO nanofibers and PCNFs as shown in Fig. 1 a and b. From the SEM images, it can be seen that the diameters of the as-prepared nanofibers are ranging from 90 to 140 nm. Fig. 1 c and d show the TEM images of the CuO nanofibers and PCNFs, indicating that those fibers have a rough surface and consist of the agglomeration of oxides nanoparticles with average size of about 40 nm. Fig. 1 e shows XRD patterns of the pure CuO nanofibers and PCNFs. The apparent monoclinic structure CuO (JCPDS 5-0661) can be detected in both samples [15] . And there is no indication of the presence of any dopants-related phases for the Pd-doped sample, attributing to the high dispersion or the poor crystallinity of dopants-related nanoparticles. In order to prove the existence of Pd component in the PCNFs, XPS has been used to investigate the bonding characteristics and oxidation states of Pd in the composite nanofibers. As shown in Fig. 1 f, the Pd 3d spectrum shows two peaks centered at 337.4 (Pd 3d 5/2 ) and 342.6 (Pd 3d 3/2 ) eV, respectively, confirming the presence of Pd component and the bonding state of palladium is in the form of Pd 4+ [16] . The electrocatalytic activity of the PCNFs modified electrode towards the oxidation of glucose in an alkaline solution is demonstrated first of all. Fig. 2 a and b displays the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) behaviors of the pure CuO nanofibers modified and PCNFs modified GC electrodes, respectively, in the absence and presence of 0.6 mM glucose in 0.10 M NaOH solution recorded at 50 mV s −1 . Upon addition of 0.6 mM glucose, a single forward oxidative wave, corresponding to the irreversible glucose oxidation is observed for both electrodes. The pure CuO nanofibers based electrode exhibits significant oxidation of glucose starting at ca. +0.15 V (vs. SCE) with a shoulder peak at ca. +0.4 V. It is much lower than that of other pure Cu or CuO based electrodes [12,17,18] . For the PCNFs modified electrode, a further substantial negative shift of the anodic peak potential and dramatic increase of current signal are observed as depicted in Fig. 2 b (dashed curve). The oxidation process starts at only 0.08 V vs. SCE, and the broad oxidative wave centers at as low as +0.32 V. The distinctly improved electrocatalytic activity of the PCNFs modified electrode towards glucose may be explained as follow. Pd sites in the PCNFs, with lower electron occupancy in their 3d orbitals in comparison to the Cu sites, can function as Lewis acid sites for adsorption of polar glucose molecules, which are Lewis bases, via their non-bonded electron pairs. Thus an increased residence time for the reactant species within the electrified interface at the electrode surface will occur, with the result of increased electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose [7,8] . The above CV measurements suggest that the PCNFs modified electrodes might be applied in the detection of glucose. In order to choose the optimal value of the applied potential for glucose detecting, Fig. 2 c shows signal-to-background ratio on the PCNFs modified electrode under different potentials measured in chronoamperometry system in 0.1 M NaOH with successive addition of 0.05 mM glucose. The signal-to-background ratio increases with the potential in range from +0.20 to +0.35 V, and then decays obviously after that potential. For a high sensitivity, a constant potential of +0.35 V is chosen and employed as the optimum potential for the determination of glucose. Fig. 2 d displays a typical amperometric response curve of glucose in 0.1 M NaOH recorded at 50 mV s −1 at the PCNFs modified electrode. A well-defined, stable and fast amperometric response can be observed at 0.35 V. With the successive addition of glucose the biosensor yields a step-like increase amperometric response (the inset of Fig. 2 d). The time required to reach the stable response is less than 1 s. The calibration curve for the glucose sensor is worked out ( Fig. 2 d). The sensor displays a linear range from 0.2 μM to 2.5 mM glucose with a correlation coefficient of 0.99, a sensitivity of 1061.4 μA mM −1 cm −2 , and a detection limit of 1.9 × 10 −8 M (S/N = 3). Moreover, the excellent sensing properties of our glucose sensor are also much more attractive than former reports [17–20] and can be explained as follow. The as-prepared electrospun nanofibers are made up of nanoparticles as demonstrated in Fig. 1 d, which have not only large surface for adsorption of the reactants but also more electron transfer passages, the electrochemical probe can arrive to the surface of the electrode more easily. Moreover, the larger length-to-diameter ratio will promote electron transfer in the oxidation of glucose [21,22] . The reproducibility and stability of the sensor is evaluated by comparing the response currents of six PCNFs modified electrodes prepared under the same conditions. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of response current is 1.9% for 1.0 mM glucose. Thirty successive measurements of 1.0 mM glucose on one PCNFs modified electrode yield an error about 7%. When the sensor is stored in air at 4 °C, it retains 94% of its initial response current after 50 days. It indicates that the sensor based on PCNFs has good reproductivity and stability. To evaluate the selectivity of the proposed biosensor, three possible interfering biomolecules, AA, UA and DA, which normally coexist with glucose in real samples (human blood) are examined. Considering that the concentration of glucose in the human blood is about 30 times of AA, UA or DA, the amperometric response of the PCNFs modified electrode towards the addition of 1 mM glucose, 0.05 mM AA, 0.1 mM UA and 0.1 mM DA is examined in 0.10 M NaOH solution. The current response produced by AA, UA and DA are 3.0, 1.9 and 2.4 μA, only 4.1%, 2.6% and 3.3% compared to that of glucose (72.7 μA), respectively. The other interference test for carbohydrate compounds is also carried out (data not shown), and negligible interference has been caused by these common interfering biomolecules. Electrodes based on metals or alloys towards the oxidation of glucose usually lose their activity due to the poisoning of chloride ions [11] . In order to understand whether chloride ions will poison the PCNFs modified electrode, the CV is measured in the solution with high concentration of chloride ions (i.e., replacing 0.10 M NaOH with 0.30 M KCl + 0.10 M NaOH as the electrolyte). The current response of PCNFs modified electrodes towards glucose oxidation remains unchanged (data not shown), implying that the PCNFs modified electrode is also highly resistant to poisoning by chloride ions and can be used as a glucose sensor even in the presence of high concentration of chloride ions. 4 Conclusion In summary, a novel amperometric non-enzymatic glucose sensor based on Pd (IV)-doped CuO nanofibers (PCNFs) has been successfully fabricated via electrospinning. The PCNFs modified electrodes display distinctly enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose, showing significantly lower overvoltage (0.32 V) and ultrafast (1 s) and sensitive current response with a lower detection limit. It is believed that our method will provide a desirable platform for large-scale design and construct effective biosensors and electrocatalyst.

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the protective effect of Wit3a gene modification on mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells against the injury induced by Ara-C. The gene-modified MSC steadily expressing Wnt3a were established by adenovirus system. The acute direct damage effects of different concentrations of Ara-C on the unmodified MSC and the gene-modified MSC were assessed by using an in vitro culture system, and the corresponding controls were set. The proliferation and apoptosis of MSC exposed to Ara-C were detected by cell count kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry. The expression of BCL-2 protein related with cell apoptosis was assayed by Western blot. The results indicated that as compared with unmodified MSC, Ara-C exhibited a less inhibitory effect on the proliferation of gene-modified MSC. There was obvious difference between unmodified MSC and gene-modified MSC (p < 0.05). The proliferation of gene-modified MSC began to recover at 72 hours after removal of Ara-C. However, unmodified MSC showed sustained suppression of proliferation after withdrawal of Ara-C. In apoptosis, the apoptosis rate of gene-modified MSC induced by Ara-C was significantly lower than those of unmodified MSC (p < 0.05). In addition, the expression levels of BCL-2 protein in gene-modified MSC were up-regulated compared with unmodified MSC (p < 0.05). It is concluded that Wnt3a gene modification can significantly mitigate the damage of mouse bone marrow MSC induced by Ara-C.",

        "abstract": "Although roles of somatic JAK2 mutations in clonally myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are well established, roles of germline JAK2 mutations in the pathogenesis of MPNs remain unclear. Recently, a novel activating, germline JAK2 F556V mutation was identified and involved in the pathogenesis of MPNs, but, its pathogenesis mechanism was still unknown. In this study, homology models of JAK2 demonstrated that F556 located between two threonine residues which interacted with ATP phosphate groups by hydrogen bonds, Thr555 with the γ-phosphate and Thr557 with the β-phosphate in the active site of JAK2's JH2 domain. Moreover, the hydrogen bond between Thr557 and Arg715 played vital roles in sustaining the structural conformation of JH2's active site and JH1-JH2 domains' interactions. When F556 was replaced by other amino acids except Trp, the hydrogen bond, JH2 domain's structural conformation and JH1-JH2 domains' interactions disrupted for changing the helix between β2 and β3 strands which finally caused JAK2 activation. Mechanistic and functional studies showed that JAK2 F556V mutation disrupted JAK2 JH2 domain's activity, caused JAK2-STAT5 pathway activation and promoted the proliferation of BaF3 cells. Thus, our results herein may provide clues to understand the pathogenesis mechanism of JAK2 F556V mutation in the MPNs.",

        "abstract": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains a life-threatening complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib exhibits potent antitumor activity with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, the effects of bortezomib on aGVHD are unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of bortezomib on aGVHD in the C57BL/6 (H-2b+) donor to BALB/c (H-2d+) recipient major histocompatibility complex-mismatched model. Two bortezomib doses (1 mg/kg each) on days 0 and +1 after transplantation, significantly increased survival rate and attenuated clinical signs of aGVHD without altering donor reconstitution. However, GVHD-associated mortality was significantly increased when bortezomib administration was delayed to day +2 posttransplantation. Furthermore, a single dose of bortezomib on day 0 or day +1 after transplantation also decreased the GVHD protective effect. Consistent with the above data, serum cytokine levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α were significantly decreased at day +7 posttransplantation after two doses of bortezomib compared with aGVHD control group. Moreover, two administrations of bortezomib reduced donor T-cell expansion at days +3 and +4 posttransplantation and enhanced donor CD4(+)T-cell differentiation into the T help cell 17 subset at day +7 after transplantation in spleens. These results indicated that the protective effects of bortezomib on aGVHD were dependent on the time and the frequency of bortezomib administration.",

To avoid the complex steps (wet surface activation, pre-treatment) of the electroless plating methods reported before, UV photoreduction is used to fabricate dense Ag nanoparticles on the outer surfaces of PAN nanofibers. These Ag nanoparticles act as seeds in the following metal electroless plating step for the growth of continuous Ag shell. Additionally, our method can be easily applied to synthesize other metallic shell on the outer surfaces of PAN nanofibers with Ag nanoparticles as seeds.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of bortezomib on prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after mouse allogeneic-bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) and its mechanism.C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice were used as donors and BALB/c (H-2d+) mice as recipients. After allo-BMT, the BALB/c mice were divided into 3 groups, ie. group A:BMT control, group B: BMT + early infusion of bortezomib (1 mg kg(-1) d(-1), day 0-3), group C: BMT + late infusion of bortezomib (1 mg kg(-1) d(-1), day 5-7). Clinical manifestations of aGVHD, pathohistological changes, survival rate and levels of recipients H-2(b) cells detected by flow cytometry in the recipient mice were observed. Monodirectional mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) system was established ex vivo and different concentrations of bortezomib (0, 2, 4, 8 nmol/L) were added to the system. The viability of the cells was detected by CCK-8 assay and cells apoptosis by flow cytometry. The concentrations of IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha in the supernatant were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The mice in group A developed typical aGVHD and all died of aGVHD within 3 weeks after transplantation, with a median survival time of (16.1 +/- 2.5) d. The symptoms of aGVHD was milder in group B than in group A, and the median survival time was significantly longer. The 60-day survival rate in group B was 70%, being significantly higher than that in other two groups(P<0.05). The mean value of donor-derived cell (H-2(b) cells) in group B was (98.1 +/- 1.1)% at 60 days. The symptoms of aGVHD was significantly severer in group C than in group A, and the median survival time was shorter. Bortezomib inhibited the cells viability in MLC system in a dose-dependent manner. After treated with 8 nmol/L bortezomib for 24 h, the inhibition ratio of cells viability was (41.4 +/- 6.0)%. The cell apoptosis rate increased gradually with bortezomib treatment for 12 h, 24 h and 36 h. After treated with 8 nmol/L bortezomib for 36 h, the apoptosis rate was (62.8 +/- 7.0)%. After treated for 24 h, the levels of IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the supernatant were decreased.Bortezomib administered immediately after allogeneic BMT can prevent aGVHD, improve the survival rate and have no influence of engraftment in the recipient mice. Delayed administration of bortezomib results in acceleration of aGVHD-induced mortality. Its mechanism maybe inhibition of the lymphocyte viability, increase of the cells apoptosis rate, and inhibition of secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha.",

Ethylene dehydrogenation is found to start from the most stable  π -bonded state instead of the previously proposed di- σ -bonded state. Our vibrational frequencies calculations verify the  π -bonded adsorption at step sites at low coverage and low surface temperature and di- σ -bonded ethylene on C-C dimer (C 2 H 4 -CC) is proposed to be the species contributing to the vibrational peaks experimentally observed at high coverage at 193 K.

Drugs were administered during the four-week period of CUMS, with the healthy group serving as negative controls, and the fluoxetine and venlafaxine groups serving as positive controls. Plasma samples were collected at 28th day, and the plasma metabolic profiling was measured using NMR, followed by multivariate analysis.Exposure to CUMS for four weeks caused depression-like behaviour in rats, as indicated by significant decreases in weight gain, sucrose consumption and locomotor activity. Eleven potential biomarkers, including seven in the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spectra, five in the diffusion-edited spectra, and one in both were identified. It was found that trimethylamine-N-oxide, alanine, β-hydroxybutyrate, valine, leucine/isoleucine, low-density lipoprotein/very low-density lipoprotein and lipids were lower and phosphatidylcholine, high-density lipoprotein, choline and N-acetyl glycoproteins were higher in CUMS-treated rats, as compared with controls. XYS significantly suppressed behavioural changes and attenuated plasma metabolite changes.XYS produced an obvious antidepressant effect, and the metabonomic approach benefits estimation of the pharmacodynamic action of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.",

        "abstract": "The present study was purposed to investigate the relation and difference of expression phase between class II transactivator (CIITA) and HLA-DR antigens after IFN-gamma induction, and the inhibition of CIITA and HLA-DR by STAT1-alpha antisense oligonucleotides (STAT1-alpha AS); and to explore the potential effect and significance of CIITA and STAT1-alpha AS in transplantation immunity. T lymphocytes from peripheral blood of healthy subjects were incubated with IFN-gamma at different doses. RT-PCR was used to detect CIITA mRNA and Western blot was used to analyze HLA-DR antigen. Then the optimum dose of IFN-gamma was chosen for the experiment. CIITA mRNA and HLA-DR antigen were detected at various time points. Different doses of STAT1-alpha AS and sense oligonucleotides (STAT1-alpha S) were added to T lymphocytes followed by IFN-gamma. After incubation with IFN-gamma, the expression of CIITA mRNA and HLA-DR was detected once again. The results showed that CIITA mRNA was detectable at 5 hours after IFN-gamma incubation and reached the peak at 14 hours, then declined, but the CIITA mRNA was still found at 23 hours. HLA-DR antigen was detectable at 28 hours after IFN-gamma incubation and reached a peak at 52 hours, then declined. CIITA mRNA expression was positively correlated to HLA-DR expression, and was earlier than the latter. The expression of CIITA mRNA in the AS groups was significantly lower than that in the control group after 5 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L and 20 micromol/L STAT1-alpha AS treatment (P < 0.01). The expression of CIITA mRNA in the S groups was higher than that in the AS groups (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between the S group and the control group. The expression of HLA-DR antigen was significantly inhibited by STAT1-alpha AS, and the expression level of HLA-DR protein in the AS group was about 64.3% of that in the control group (P < 0.01), while there was no significant difference in HLA-DR expression between the S group and the control group. The changes in HLA-DR expression were similar to those in CIITA expression after STAT1-alpha AS treatment. It is concluded that CIITA expression is positively correlated with HLA-DR expression, and was detectable earlier than that of latter after IFN-gamma incubation. Stat1-alpha antisense oligonucleotides may have a sequence-specific inhibiting effect on the expression of CIITA and HLA-DR antigen after IFN-gamma incubation in vitro culture, and can prevent T lymphocyte activation. CIITA may play an important role in pathogenesis of transplantation immunity.",

        "abstract": "A single water molecule is nothing special. However, macroscopic water displays many anomalous properties at interfaces, such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, hydrogen bonds between water molecules are expected to play a major role in these interesting phenomena. An important question concerns whether water clusters containing few molecules are qualitatively different from a single molecule. Using the water adsorption behavior as an example and by carefully choosing two-dimensional silicene as the substrate material, we demonstrate that water monomers, dimers, and trimers show distinct adsorption properties at the substrate surface. On silicene, the additional water molecules in dimers and trimers induce a transition from physisorption to chemisorption and then to dissociation, arising from the enhancement of charge transfer and proton transfer processes induced by hydrogen bonding. Such a hydrogen bond autocatalytic effect is expected to have broad applications in metal-free catalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction and water dissociation.",

One of our previous studies showed that elevated IL-22 correlated to Th1 and Th22 cells plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of ITP. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of high-dose dexamethasone(HD-DXM) on IL-22 production and on the IL-22-producing T-cell subsets in ITP patients.IL-22 plasma levels and the percentages of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry in 25 ITP patients receiving DXM 40 mg/day for 4 consecutive days.Plasma IL-22 concentrations and the percentages of Th1 and Th22 cells were significantly increased in pretherapy patients relative to controls (P<0.05), but the percentage of Th17 cells was not. HD-DXM administration reduced IL-22 production and corrected the imbalance between Th1 and Th22 subsets. IL-22 levels were positively correlated with Th1 and Th22 cells in ITP patients before and after HD-DXM treatment.These results suggest that HD-DXM may regulate the production of IL-22 in ITP, possibly by correcting Th1 and Th22 polarization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Heterogeneous and supramolecular catalysis are fundamental processes in chemistry. To understand the synergistic role between heterogeneous and supramolecular catalysis, the catalytic mechanism of cucurbituril solid for epoxide alcoholysis was investigated by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results reveal that styrene oxide (StyOx) ethanolysis has an inherent regioselectivity, which results from different groups linked to the epoxy group. The hydronium ion can catalyze the ring-opening of StyOx ethanolysis and lead to the formation of a planar carbenium ion. StyOx can also be hydrolyzed via the homogenous catalysis of acid to produce 1, 2-diol. Cucurbituril solid can catalyze epoxide alcoholysis because of its acidic property. Its unique cavity can lead to a favorable frontside-attack of the alcohol on the carbenium ion. The product from the heterogeneous catalysis of cucurbituril solid is pure  β -alkoxy alcohol. The results are important to understand heterogeneous and supramolecular catalysis and the design of new and effective supramolecular catalysts.",

First, water is activated by the pre-covered oxygen atom and dissociates to OHads group. Then, OHads reacts with COads to form chemisorbed HOCOads. Finally, with the aid of water, HOCOads dissociates to CO2. The whole process can be described as 1/2H2Oads + H2Oads + 1/2Oads + COads → H3Oads + CO2, gas. One CO2 is formed with only 1/2 pre-covered oxygen atom. That is why more CO2 is observed when water is present on oxygen pre-covered Au (111) surface. Activation energy of each elementary step is low\n enough to allow the reaction to proceed at low temperature.",

        "abstract": "To develop new functional materials and nanoscale electronics, researchers would like to accurately describe and precisely control the quantum state of a single molecule on a surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), combined with first-principles simulations, provides a powerful technique for acquiring this level of understanding. Traditionally, metal phthalocyanine (MPc) molecules, composed of a metal atom surrounded by a ligand ring, have been used as dyes and pigments. Recently, MPc molecules have shown great promise as components of light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, photovoltaic cells, and single-molecule devices. In this Account, we describe recent research on the characterization and control of adsorption and electronic states of a single MPc molecule on noble metal surfaces. In general, the electronic and magnetic properties of a MPc molecule largely depend on the type of metal ion within the phthalocyanine ligand and the type of surface on which the molecule is adsorbed. However, with the STM technique, we can use on-site molecular \"surgery\" to manipulate the structure and the properties of the molecule. For example, STM can induce a dehydrogenation reaction of the MPc, which allows us to control the Kondo effect, which describes the spin polarization of the molecule and its interaction with the complex environment. A specially designed STM tip can allow researchers to detect certain molecule-surface hybrid states that are not accessible by other techniques. By matching the local orbital symmetry of the STM tip and the molecule, we can generate the negative differential resistance effect in the formed molecular junction. This orbital symmetry based mechanism is extremely robust and does not critically depend on the geometry of the STM tip. In summary, this simple model system, a MPc molecule absorbed on a noble metal surface, demonstrates the power of STM for quantum characterization and manipulation of single molecules, highlighting the potential of this technique in a variety of applications.",

        "abstract": "Naozhenning granule is a Chinese herbal formula, which is mainly used in the treatment of concussion, cerebral post-traumatic syndrome. Although its effectiveness has been certified in the clinical use, the mechanism of action and bioactive components of Naozhenning remain unknown. In this study, the ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry was applied to identify the absorbed constituents of Naozhenning in the rat serum. A total of 60 compounds, including 30 prototype components and 30 metabolites were identified. Then the absorbed constituents were subjected to the network pharmacology analysis. The compound-target-disease (CTD) and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 40 absorbed constituents, 56 target genes and three key pathways such as RAS, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, TGFβ were probably related with the efficacy of Naozhenning against cerebral trauma and cerebral concussion. The results provided a scientific basis for understanding the bioactive compounds and the pharmacological mechanism of Naozhenning granule.",

Scanning tunneling spectroscopy preformed at 5 K on these two types of nanoparticles exhibits clear Coulomb blockade and Coulomb staircases. Size dependent multipeak spectral features in the differential conductance curve are observed for the crystalline Pd particles but not for the amorphous particles. Theoretical analysis shows that these spectral features are related to the quantized electronic states in the crystalline Pd particle. The suppression of the quantum confinement effect in the amorphous particle arises from the reduction of the degeneracy of the eigenstates and the level broadening due to the reduced lifetime of the electronic states.",

The main source of AR in China is the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, and both cultivated and wild ARs are used clinically. A systematic comparison of cultivated AR (GS-AR) and wild AR (SX-AR) should be performed to ensure the clinical efficacy and safety. In this study, the chemical composition of the two different ARs, which were collected in the Shanxi (wild) and Gansu (cultivated) provinces, were compared by NMR-based metabolic fingerprint coupled with multivariate analysis. The SX-AR- and GS-AR-induced metabolic changes in the endogenous metabolites in mice were also compared. The results showed that SX-AR and GS-AR differed significantly not only in the primary metabolites but also in the secondary metabolites. However, alterations among the endogenous metabolites in the serum, lung, liver, and spleen were relatively small. This study provided a novel and valuable method for the evaluation of the consistency and diversity of herbal drugs, and further studies should be conducted on the difference in polysaccharides as well as the biological effects between the two kinds of AR.",

        "abstract": "A single water molecule has nothing special. However, macroscopic water displays many anomalous properties at the interface, such as a high surface tension, hydrophobicity and hydrophillicity. Although the underlying mechanism is still elusive, hydrogen bond is expected to have played an important role. An interesting question is if the few-water molecule clusters will be qualitatively different from a single molecule. Using adsorption behavior as an example, by carefully choosing two-dimensional silicene as the substrate material, we demonstrate that water monomer, dimer and trimer show contrasting properties. The additional water molecules in dimer and trimer induce a transition from physisorption to chemisorption then to dissociation on silicene. Such a hydrogen bond autocatalytic effect is expected to have a broad application potential in silicene-based water molecule sensor and metal-free catalyst for water dissociation.",

        "abstract": "Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is an important mediator of cytokine receptor signaling and plays a key role in the hematopoietic and immune responses. The acquired JAK2 C618R somatic mutation is detected in a subset of myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) patients and presumed to be a biomarker for MPDs. However, how JAK2 C618R mutation causes MPDs is still unclear. Our results indicate that the amino acid residue E543 in JAK2 C618R is indispensable for its constitutive activation. When the glutamic acid at this position was mutated to alanine (E543A) in the JAK2 C618R, its activity significantly decreased. However when the glutamic acid was mutated to the acidic amino acid, aspartic acid, JAK2 C618R activity changed little. These results suggest that there is an interaction between the amino acid residue R618 and E543, and that this interaction is crucial to sustain the constitutive activation of JAK2 C618R. More importantly, the E543 single mutation had no effects on the function of wild type JAK2 (WT JAK2). This study suggests that the amino acid residue E543 might be a potential target for specific inhibitors to treat MPDs caused by the JAK2 C618R mutation.",

        "abstract": "Graphene has attracted intense research interest due to its exotic properties and potential applications. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu foils has shown great promises for macroscopic growth of high-quality graphene. By delicate design and control of the CVD conditions, here we demonstrate that a nonequilibrium steady state can be achieved in the gas phase along the CVD tube, that is, the active species from methane cracking increase in quantity, which results in a thickness increase continually for graphene grown independently at different positions downstream. In contrast, uniform monolayer graphene is achieved everywhere if Cu foils are distributed simultaneously with equal distance in the tube, which is attributed to the tremendous density shrink of the active species in the gas phase due to the sink effect of the Cu substrates. Our results suggest that the gas-phase reactions and dynamics are critical for the CVD growth of graphene and further demonstrate that the graphene thickness from the CVD growth can be fine-tuned by controlling the gas-phase dynamics. A similar strategy is expected to be feasible to control the growth of other nanostructures from gas phases as well. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pathophysiological mechanism of local microenvironment is complex after central nerve injury; especially, both inflammatory reaction at an acute phase and formation of secondary glial scar have tremendous effects on effective regeneration of axon, regeneration and arrangement of local nerve cells, proliferation and migration of local stem cells; therefore, it becomes a basic reason for blocking nerve repair in an early period. Thus, how to effectively resist inflammatory factors in injured region at an acute phase and how to optimize microenvironment of neural regeneration are the most important strategies for repairing spinal cord injury in recent years. Objective: To design, establish and screen the best expression of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) α to inhibit shRNA adenovirus expression vector by using spinal cord injury models. Design: Duplicative measurement study. Setting: Department of Spine Surgery, the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen. Materials: A total of 40 healthy Wistar rats, either gender, 8-10 weeks old, were selected in this study. Rabbit-anti-rat glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody I was provided by Santa Cruz Company; siRNA eukaryon expression plasmid pGenesil (containing green fluorescent expression system) was provided by Wuhan Jingsai Bioengineering Company. Methods: The experiment was carded out in Immune Opening Laboratory, Basic Medical Faulty, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Medical Laboratory Center, the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen in November 2006. Three pairs of shRNA template which composed of 19 bp reverse repeated motif of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) α target sequence with 9 bp spacer were designed and synthesized, then the recombinant adenovirus expression vectors with green fluorescence protein were constructed in vitro respectively. The acute spinal cord injury models were completed, and the adenovirus recombinants were regionally injected post 12 hours after spinal cord injury; in addition, the inhibitory effect of RNA interference (RNAi) on expression of IL-6R in local region after spinal cord injury were detected by using real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot so as to screen adenovirus expression vector which had the best inhibitory effect on expression of IL-6R. Main Outcome Measures: Inhibitory effect of RNAi on expressions of IL-6R RNA and protein in local region after spinal cord injury. Results: Sequence analysis showed that IL-6R-shRNA recombinant adenovirus expression vector was successfully constructed, and optimal IL-6R-shRNA recombinant adenovirus expression vector was screened by using real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. The IL-6R expressions were 49% and 56% at the levels of mRNA and protein, respectively. Conclusion: the IL-6R - shRNA recombinant adenovirus expression vector is successfully constructed and screened. The gene expression of IL-6R can be highly inhibited after acute spinal cord injury.",

In this work, we demonstrated that the porous silicene can be used as an effective ultimate membrane for helium purification on the basis of first-principles calculations. Prinstine silicene monolayer is impermeable to helium gas with a high penetration energy barrier (1.66 eV). However, porous silicene with either Stone-Wales (SW) or divacancy (555,777 or 585) defect presents a surmountable barrier for helium (0.33 to 0.78 eV) but formidable for Ne, Ar, and other gas molecules. In particular, the porous silicene with divacancy defects shows high selectivity for He/Ne and He/Ar, superior to graphene, polyphenylene, and traditional membranes.",

The results show that the energy barriers can be reduced efficiently by all types of nitrogen doping in both carbon nanotubes and graphene. Graphite-like nitrogen and Stone-Wales defect nitrogen decrease the energy barrier more efficiently than pyridine-like nitrogen, and a dissociation barrier lower than 0.2 eV can be obtained. Higher nitrogen concentration reduces the energy barrier much more efficiently for graphite-like nitrogen. These observations are closely related to partial occupation of π* orbitals and change of work functions. Our results thus provide useful insights into the oxygen reduction reactions.",

        "abstract": "We report a first-principles projector augmented wave (PAW) study on Na 0.5CoO 2. With the sodium ion ordered insulating phase being identified in experiments, pure density functional calculations fail to predict an insulating ground state, which indicates that Na ordering alone cannot produce accompanying Co charge ordering if additional correlation is not properly considered. At this level of theory, the most stable phase presents ferromagnetic ordering within the CoO 2 layer and antiferromagnetic coupling between these layers. When the on-site Coulomb interaction for Co 3d orbitals is included by an additional Hubbard parameter U, a charge ordered insulating ground state can be obtained. The effect of on-site interaction magnitude on electronic structure is studied. At a moderate value of U (4.0 eV, for example), the ground state is antiferromagnetic, with a Co 4+ magnetic moment about 1.0 μ B and-a magnetic energy of 0.12 eV/Co. The rehybridization process is also studied in the DFT+U point of view (where DFT represents density functional theory). © 2005 The American Physical Society.",

The packaged virus was harvested 72 h later. The survival of T cells expressing HSV-sr39tk or HSV-tk was measured by MTT assay after 4 day-culture against a gradient of GCV or ACV concentrations.The three plasmids were effectively cotransfected and a high titre of lentivirus was obtained (2 x 10(6) IU/ml). 39tk(+) T cell survival rates declined promptly when the prodrug GCV/ACV concentrations increased from 0 micromol/L to 10 micromol/L. The T cell survival rates in GCV group declined from (96.04 +/- 3.23)% to (36.76 +/- 4.38)% while in ACV group from (97.31 +/- 4.61)% to (43.75 +/- 8.99)%. However, when GCV/ACV concentrations were more than 10 micromol/L, further decline of 39tk(+) T cell survival rates became unobvious. The growth rate of 39tk(+) T cell exposed to GCV or ACV was obviously lower than that in un-transfected T cells (P < 0.05). Tk(+) T cells were sensitive to GCV (P < 0.05), but not to ACV (P > 0.05). There was a significant difference in killing effects between 39tk(+) T cell + GCV group and tk(+) T cell + GCV group (P < 0.05).The lentiviral vectors containing HSV-sr39tk gene could infect T lymphocytes effectively and stably without affecting the proliferation of the transduced cell. In contrast to HSV-tk gene, T cells infected HSV-sr39tk were more sensitive not only to GCV but also to ACV.",

Furthermore, no study about any biomarker or biomarker panel for aGVHD grading or steroid sensitivity of aGVHD patients simultaneously has been reported.METHODSHere we established an aGVHD mouse model and explored the relation between aGVHD onset and variations of some cytokines. Based on the results and latest progress, we selected 16 cytokines and compared their serum variations in aGVHD patients and non-aGVHD patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using protein microarray, we explored the relation between the cytokine levels and aGVHD-related events (onset, grading, and steroid sensitivity).RESULTSThe increase of chemokine levels in murine aGVHD was very consistent with that of patients. We found obviously higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, Elafin, sST2, TLR4, and TNF-α, and lower levels of TGF-β in both aGVHD mouse models and aGVHD patients. In addition, patients with severe aGVHD showed increased IL-6, TLR4, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), and Elafin and decreased TGF-β. TLR4 and TNFR1 were significantly increased in steroid-refractory aGVHD patients compared with steroid-effective patients (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONA combination of TLR4, TNFR1, TGF-β, and Elafin could be a new 4-biomarker panel to assist aGVHD diagnosis, grading, and evaluation of steroid sensitivity for clinical aGVHD patients.TRIAL REGISTRATIONChiCTR1900022292 \"Clinical Research of Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the Prophylaxis of Graft-Versus-Host Disease After HLA-Haploidentical Stem-Cell Transplantation.\"FUNDINGNational Key Research Program, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chongqing Social Career and People's Livelihood Security Science and Technology Innovation Project, Fundamental and Frontier Research Program of Chongqing, and Foundation of Xinqiao Hospital.",

Here, we report a molecular beam epitaxial growth of single layer blue phosphorus on Au(111) by using black phosphorus as precursor, through the combination of in situ low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculation. The structure of the as-grown single layer blue phosphorus on Au(111) is explained with a (4 × 4) blue phosphorus unit cell coinciding with a (5 × 5) Au(111) unit cell, and this is verified by the theoretical calculations. The electronic bandgap of single layer blue phosphorus on Au(111) is determined to be 1.10 eV by scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurement. The realization of epitaxial growth of large-scale and high quality atomic-layered blue phosphorus can enable the rapid development of novel electronic and optoelect...",

Under the station’s condition,pollution differences between different insulators and different stresses mainly appeared on the insulators’ under-surfaces. During the main pollution period,upper-surface pollution accumulation rate of composite insulators was slightly higher than porcelain insulators’,while the under-surface pollution accumulation rate of composite insulators was 2 times as much as porcelain insulators’,under AC stress. The under-surface pollution ratio between DC stressed and AC stressed composite insulators was more than 5. For porcelain insulators,this ratio was 10. Pollution composition of insulators under DC and AC stress was analyzed. Two kinds of insulator cleaning processes by rain were observed in high and low precipitation. Self cleaning of composite insulators' under-surface was slightly hindered by hydrophobicity. The upper-surface pollution ratio between 3-year exposed and 1-year exposed composite insulators was about 1,while this ratio for under-surface under DC and AC stress were 2.2 and 1.4,respectively.",

Methods From June 2006 to August 2009, 36 cases of metastatic spinal tumors were treated with the percutaneous injection of rAd-p53 combined with radiotherapy (n=18) or radiotherapy alone (n=18), respectively. Thirty-six cases were observed before and after treatment including the change of the tumors, the tumor cell necrosis rate, P53 protein in cancer tissue, and serum anti-p53 adenovirus-specific antibody levels. Results The effect rate of combination therapy group was 66.7%, showing significantly higher than that of radiotherapy group (27.8%, P<0.05). Tumor cell necrosis in combination therapy group was predominant. P53 protein expression was positive and anti-p53 adenovirus-specific antibody level was strong positive in combinant therapy group. Conclusion The rAd-p53 gene therapy can inhibit tumor growth and is an effective treatment for spinal metastases, and combination therapy can make up for lack of a single radiation to improve sensitivity to radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Diarylpyrimidine derivatives (DAPYs) exhibit robust anti-HIV-1 potency, although they have been compromised by E138K variant and severe side-effects and been suffering from poor water solubility. In the present work, hydrophilic morpholine or methylsulfonyl and sulfamide-substituted piperazine/piperidines were introduced into the right wing of DAPYs targeting the solvent-exposed tolerant region I. The anti-HIV-1 activities of 11c (EC50(WT) = 0.0035 μM, EC50(E138K) = 0.0075 μM) were the same as and 2-fold better than that of the lead etravirine against the wild-type and E138K mutant HIV-1, respectively, with a relative low cytotoxicity (CC50 ≥ 173 μM). Further test showed a significant improvement in the water solubility of 11c. Besides, 11c displayed no significant inhibition on main cytochrome P450 enzymes and exhibited no acute/subacute toxicities at doses of 2000 mg·kg–1/50 mg·kg–1 in mice. Taken together, we consider that 11c is a promising lead for further structural optimization.",

The morphology and structure of the as-prepared nanofibers have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose in alkaline medium at nickel oxide modified glassy carbon electrodes has been investigated. The modified electrodes offer excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the glucose oxidation at low positive potential (0.3 V). Glucose has been determined chronoamperometrically at the surface of NiO nanofibers modified electrode in 0.5 mM NaOH. Under the optimized condition, the calibration curve is linear in the concentration range of 2 x 10(-3) mM - 1 mM, and 1 mM - 9.5 mM. The detection limit (signal-to-noise 3) and response time are 3.394 x 10(-6) M and 2 s, respectively. The NiO electrospun nanofibers is easy to prepare and feasible in economy. The modified electrode is steady and can be used repeatedly, so it is reasonable to expect its broad use in non-enzymatic glucose sensor.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, a new immunotherapy for relapsed and refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies, can be accompanied by adverse events including coagulation disorders. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation parameters in 100 patients with R/R hematologic malignancies after receiving CAR-T cell therapy to illuminate the profiles of coagulation disorders, and to facilitate the management of coagulation disorders. A high incidence of coagulation disorders was observed, including elevated D-dimer (50/100, 50%), increased FDP (45/100, 45%), decreased fibrinogen (23/100, 23%), prolonged APTT (17/100, 17%), and prolonged PT (10/100, 10%). Coagulation disorders occurred mainly during day 6 and day 20 after CAR-T cell infusion. The changes of coagulation parameters were associated with high tumor burden in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), more lines of prior therapies, lower baseline platelet count, and especially cytokines released syndrome (CRS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was found in 7 patients with grade ≥3 CRS, and indicated a poor prognosis. Our study suggests that coagulation disorders are manageable in most patients after CAR-T cell therapy. Coexistence of DIC and severe CRS is closely related to non-relapsed deaths during the acute toxicity phase, and effective and timely treatment is the key to reduce non-relapse mortality for patients with DIC and severe CRS.",

        "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation given before an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation severely damage thymic epithelial cells (TECs) resulting in poor posttransplant immune recovery. IL-22 mediates recovery of TECs via a pro-regenerative effect but the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. In this study, we found IL-22 improved thymus recovery after damage from irradiation in association with increased number of TECs. This effect was blocked by ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2-inhibitor. IL-22 increased the number of TECs via a Stat3-dependent signaling in the mTEC1 murine thymic epithelial cell line. This, in turn, upregulated transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl1) resulting in increased number of TECs. Similar effects were seen in irradiated mice given IL-22. Defects in IL-22 resulted in delayed thymus recovery in irradiated mice and had an impact on levels of thymus function related genes such as Foxn1, Aire and Kgf. In mice, posttransplant use of IL-22 improved repair of TECs, increased the numbers of thymus T cells, increased the intra-thymic levels of Aire and increased proportion of natural regulatory T cells resulting in decreased severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Our data highlight the critical role of the IL-22/Stat3/Mcl-1 pathway in regeneration of TECs after damage from irradiation in mice and highlight circumstances where normalizing thymus T-cell function with IL-22 decreases GVHD post allotransplants.",

HOXA9 gene is part of the cluster A on chromosome 7 and encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor which may regulate gene expression, morphogenesis, and differentiation. The objective of this study was to determine the HOXA9 gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this purpose, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure HOXA9 gene expression in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line and bone marrow mononuclear cells from 54 AML patients and 20 healthy individuals. The data show that HOXA9 mRNA expression was negative in 20 healthy individuals but was positive in HEL cells and in 22 out of 54 (40.74%) AML patients. The complete remission rate (45.45%) of the patients who expressed the gene was significantly lower than that (71.86%) in patients who did not express the gene after chemotherapy. Therefore, it was concluded that HOXA9 gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML and played as a worse prognostic factor in AML.",

Due to the uncertainty effects of different chemical separation processes for removing 36S, there is a high degree of uncertainty in 36Cl accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurements if the ratio of 36Cl/Cl is lower than 1014 . A 36Cl AMS higher sensitivity measurement has been set up by using a E-Q3D method at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The performances of E-Q3D method for 36Cl-AMS measurement had been systemically studied. The experimental results show that the E-Q3D method has a higher isobar suppression factor. Taking advantage of direct removing 36S, the sample preparation can be simplified and the uncertainty effects of different chemical separation processes can be reduced in 36Cl AMS measurements.",

Photocatalysts with high adsorption, good photocatalytic ability and highly recoverable performance are highly desirable to effective clean organic contaminates from water. In this study, a highly recoverable TiO 2 /carbon-clay photocatalyst was prepared by immobilizing TiO 2  (commercial P25) on strong adsorbent (clay) via a bio-mimetic coating strategy and followed by a carbonization process. Superior separability of TiO 2 /carbon-clay was achieved by simple gravity sedimentation, in which most of TiO 2 /carbon-clay settled within 5 min and all the particles settled within 2 h. The obtained TiO 2 /carbon-clay composites possessed a maximum adsorption capacity (Q max ) of 95.4 mg/g and showed high photocatalytic activity, which removed 99% dye within 30 min under simulated sunlight irradiation. This TiO 2 /carbon-clay composites also exhibited excellent durability and no apparent reduction of dye removal efficiency was observed after 5 cycles reuse.",

The simulated STM images show submolecular structures and reproduce the main features of the experimental images. The results show that the valence configuration of the metal ion has a strong influence on the STM images. At small tip bias voltage, unlike ScPc, NiPc and CuPc, wherein the central metal ions appear as a hole in the molecular images, the metal ion in other MPcs STM images are the highlighted bumps. Moreover, we have studied the dependentce of the STM images of ScPc and NiPc molecules on the bias voltage, and predicted that the central metal ions in ScPc and NiPc images appear as bumps when the tip bias voltage is larger than - 0.8V and 0.7V, respectively. The simulated STM images are interpreted as that the ScPc, NiPc and CuPc molecules have no significant dz 2 character near the Fermi level, while the TiPc, VPc, CrPc, MnPc, FePc and CoPc systems have.",

        "abstract": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) has become the important complication post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Abnormally activated T cells might play an important role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD. But its exact mechanism remains poorly understood. T cell immune response cDNA 7 (TIRC7) has been identified to be essential in T cell activation; however, the role of TIRC7 in aGVHD remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to measure the expression of TIRC7 and T helper (Th) cells in patients with aGVHD before and after treatment. We showed that TIRC7 levels in aGVHD patients were higher than those of healthy controls and markedly declined after treatment. The levels of IFN-γ (Th1), IL-17 (Th17), and IL-22 (Th22) were in accordance with the grade of aGVHD. In addition, TIRC7 levels were also associated with the severity of aGVHD. In conclusion, TIRC7 might be involved in the pathogenesis of aGVHD and TIRC7 level might be an indicator to evaluate the response of patients with aGVHD to treatment.",

        "abstract": "Certain amount of Cr 2 O 3 has been in situ added to ZnO nanofibers during the electrospinning process and subsequent calcination to form Cr 2 O 3 -sensitized ZnO (C-s-Z) nanofibers. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared nanofibers have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effect of the Cr 2 O 3 component in C-s-Z nanofibers on the gas sensing properties has been evaluated by the responses to ethanol vapor. The results have showed that the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 exhibit the best sensing properties to ethanol vapor. The response to 1 ppm ethanol vapor is as high as 3.6, and the response and recovery time are about 1 and 5 s, respectively. In addition, the as-prepared sensors exhibit excellent selectivity and stability. These results indicate that the C-s-Z electrospun composite nanofibers can be used in fabricating high performance gas sensors. Keywords ZnO Gas detector Cr 2 O 3 -sensitized Electrospinning Nanofibers 1 Introduction Zinc oxide (ZnO), as an interesting chemically and thermally stable n-type semiconductor with large exciton binding energy and large bandgap energy, has been extensively used in the production of photocatalysts [1] , optoelectronic devices [2] , solar cells [3,4] and so on. Recently, many investigations on sensors based on ZnO for the detection of toxic and combustible gases have also been reported [5–7] . Along with the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures have been proposed to be promising candidates for efficient gas sensing [8,9] . In recent years, in order to further improve the sensing properties of ZnO based gas detectors, a series of post-treatment methods for activating ZnO have been developed, including ball-milling [10] , sputtering [11] , deposition [12] , and so on. Noble metal catalysts [6] and some oxides [12,13] are widely used to activate ZnO, and improved gas sensing performances are obtained. However, these post-treatment processes are complicated and suffer from the instability of noble metal modified ZnO based sensors. Electrospinning is a unique technique which offers a relatively facile and versatile method for the large-scale synthesis 1D nanostructures that are exceptionally long in length, uniform in diameter, large in surface area, especially diversified in composition [14] . Our group has successfully fabricated several efficient ethanol detectors based on single electrospun oxides [15,16] . In the present work, promoted by both the distinct properties of 1D nanostructure and the effects of oxide additives on the sensing performance, we develop an in situ process for sensitizing ZnO by adding oxides during electrospinning and subsequent calcination. Thus, a new type of ethanol detectors based on Cr 2 O 3 -sensitized ZnO (C-s-Z) nanofibers is obtained. Although Cr 2 O 3 (p-type) is reported to have poor gas sensing properties [17] , it can enhance the gas sensing performances of ZnO nanofibers obviously. The as-synthesized sensors based on C-s-Z nanofibers exhibit much more excellent ethanol sensing characteristics, including faster response (∼1 s) and recovery (∼5 s) behaviors, lower detection limit (1 ppm) and higher sensitivity. 2 Experimental details 2.1 Preparation and characterization of C-s-Z composite nanofibers Zinc nitrate, chromium nitrate and poly(vinyl pyrroridone) (PVP, Mw = 1,300,000) were supplied by Beijing Chemical Co. (China). Triton X-100 (C 34 H 62 O 11 ) was purchased from Aldrich. Ethanol and dimethylformamide (DMF) were bought from Tianjin Tiantai Chemical Co. (China). All the chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Cr 2 O 3 -sensitized ZnO (C-s-Z) composite nanofibers are fabricated through electrospinning and followed by calcination. In a typical procedure [18] , 0.32 g of zinc nitrate and certain amount of chromium nitrate were added into a mixed solvent of N,N -dimethylformamide/ethanol containing a little Triton X-100 as surfactant in a glove box under vigorous stirring for 6 h. Subsequently, 0.6 g of PVP was added into the above solution under vigorous stirring for 6 h. Then, the mixture was loaded into a glass syringe for electrospinning by applying a high voltage of 12 kV at an electrode distance of 20 cm. The composite nanofibers were collected on an aluminum frame, transferred to a standard microscopic thin mica slide. After that, the organic constituents were selectively removed from these nanofibers by treating them at 600 °C for 5 h, and crystal C-s-Z composite nanofibers were obtained. The crystal structures of the products were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens D5005, Germany, Cu Kα X-radiation at 40 kV and 50 mA). Analysis of the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed on an ESCLABMKII using Mg as excitation source. The morphologies of the electrospun nanofibers were viewed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SHIMADZU SSX-550, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Model JEM-2000EX, JEOL) observations were performed with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. 2.2 Fabrication and measurement of sensors The structure of the gas sensor belongs to indirect heating type. The gas sensor is fabricated as follows: the as-prepared sample was mixed and ground with a suitable amount of distilled water in an agate mortar to form a paste. Then the paste was coated on an alumina tube, on which two platinum wires had been previously installed at each end. After the alumina tube was sintered at 300 °C for 2 h, a small Ni–Cr alloy wire was placed through the tube as a heater, which provided operating temperature. In order to improve their stability and repeatability, the gas sensors were aged at 300 °C for 48 h in air. The sensing properties were tested in a chamber with a volume of 0.001 m 3 . The target gases were injected into the closed chamber by a microinjector. The response of the gas sensors was measured under a steady-state condition. The electrical properties of the sensors were examined by RQ-2 gas-sensitive capacity measurer. The testing principle of the sensor was similar to that of pervious report [19] . In the present paper, the gas response was defined as response = R a / R g , where R g and R a denote the sensors’ resistances in the presence and in the absence of the detected gas. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) shows XRD patterns of the pure ZnO and C-s-Z nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning technique and subsequent calcination. The observed peaks are matching well with JCPDS reported data of ZnO [20] . The sharp peaks of the XRD patterns correspond to ZnO material and are observed to be polycrystalline in nature. No peaks corresponding to Cr 2 O 3 are observed, which may be due to its poor crystallinity and small mass% in the composite nanofibers. In order to prove the existence of Cr 2 O 3 component in the composite nanofibers, further characterization has been done using XPS to investigate the bonding characteristics and oxidation states of Cr in the composite nanofibers. The XPS survey spectrum of the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 is recorded, which is shown in Fig. 1 (b). The Cr 2p spectrum shows two peaks centered at 577.2 and 586.2 eV, respectively, indicating the bonding state of chromium is in the form of Cr 2 O 3 [21,22] . The typical SEM images have been used to characterize the morphologies of pure ZnO nanofibers and C-s-Z nanofibers. Fig. 2 (a) shows the SEM image of the pure ZnO nanofibers, while Fig. 2 (b), (c) and (d) show the morphologies of the C-s-Z nanofibers containing different contents of Cr 2 O 3 . From the SEM images, it can be clearly seen that the diameters of the as-prepared nanofibers for all the samples are ranging from 80 to 130 nm. TEM images of the nanofibers are shown in Fig. 3 , indicating that the fibers have a rough surface, and formed through the agglomeration of ZnO and Cr 2 O 3 nanoparticles. An effect of Cr 2 O 3 component in C-s-Z nanofibers on gas sensing properties has been studied. Fig. 4 depicts the variation of the gas response to 100 ppm ethanol of our nanosensors sensitized by different contents of Cr 2 O 3 at 300 °C, which is the optimum operating temperature for our sensors (as shown in Fig. S2, Supporting Information ). It is observed that the largest gas response is obtained when the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 , while the gas response falls down when the content of Cr 2 O 3 increases. The response of the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 is 24 towards 100 ppm ethanol, which is much better than pure ZnO nanofibers. So it is used in all the following experiments. The sensor based on the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 exhibits not only extremely high response values, but also ultrafast response/recovery characteristics to ethanol, as shown in Fig. 5 . In the measurements, four periods are examined at each fixed concentration. When exposed to 1 ppm ethanol, the response is as high as 3.6. With increasing the concentration of ethanol, the sensitivities greatly increase. The response values are about 5, 13.5, 24, 39 to 10, 50, 100, and 200 ppm ethanol, respectively. These results are even much higher than that of noble metal-functionalized sensors reported previously [6] . Furthermore, it can also be seen that the signal from the sensor becomes stable only within 1 s after it is exposed to ethanol, and returns to the original values within 5 s after the tested vapor is replaced with air. Thus, the response and recovery time are found to be about 1 and 5 s, respectively. We mainly attribute the rapid response and recovery to the 1D nanostructure of our electrospun nanofibers, which can facilitate fast mass transfer of ethanol molecules to and from the interaction region as well as improve the rate for charge carriers to traverse the barriers induced by molecular recognition along the fibers [18,23] . The responses of the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 versus ethanol concentrations at 300 °C are given in Fig. 6 . The response increases remarkably with the increase of ethanol concentration, and when the ethanol concentration is above 15,000 ppm, it reaches saturation. The relationship between the response and ethanol concentration follows the formula R = AP β , where P is the ethanol concentration, A and β are constants for certain materials [24] . As shown in the inset of Fig. 6 , at relatively low ethanol concentration, the response increases nearly linearly with the ethanol concentration in the range 1–300 ppm, and β is found to be 1. For the pure ZnO nanofibers, however, the sensitivities are only 3.5, 6, 9 and 14.4 to 10, 50, 100 and 200 ppm ethanol. Thus the sensing properties are strongly enhanced by adding certain amount of Cr 2 O 3 . Fig. 7 (a) shows the responses of the sensor based on C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 to C 2 H 5 OH (ethanol), NH 3 , CO, NO, NO 2 , CH 4 and H 2 at 300 °C. All kinds of gases are in the same concentration (100 ppm). Those results imply that the sensor is less sensitive to NH 4 , H 2 , CH 4 , and totally insensitive to CO, NO, NO 2 . This trend can be attributed to the effect of operating temperature on the activity of gas molecules [5] . At an operating temperature of 300 °C, ZnO-based sensing materials usually exhibit high response to ethanol but very low response to other gases. The long-time stability of the sensor has also been measured as shown in Fig. 7 (b). It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a nearly constant sensor signal to 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 ppm ethanol during the test, confirming the good stability of the sensor based on C-s-Z electrospun nanofibers. For ZnO-based sensing materials, the change in resistance is primarily caused by the adsorption and desorption of the target gas molecules on the surface of the sensing structure [25] . When exposed to air, the surface of the ZnO nanofibers will adsorb some oxygen molecules. The adsorbed oxygen will capture electrons from the conduction band of the ZnO nanofibers to become oxygen ions. Consequently, depletion layers are formed in the surface area of the ZnO nanofibers with an aligned arrangement, causing the carrier concentration to decrease, and leading to the high resistance of the sensor. When the ZnO nanofibers are exposed to ethanol, the ethanol molecules will react with the adsorbed ions, releasing the trapped electrons back to the conduction band, and then the carrier concentration of ZnO will increase. Accordingly, the resistance of the sensor decreases and the electrical signal can be detected. Comparing with pure ZnO nanofibers, the C-s-Z nanofibers containing 3.0 and 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 exhibit much higher gas response, which may be explained as follows. It is observed from Fig. 8 that the initial resistances of C-s-Z nanofibers based sensors are larger than that of pure ZnO nanofibers based in air ambient, which is due to the intergranular potential barrier. It is believed that some heterogeneous intergrain boundaries of Cr 2 O 3 (p-type)–ZnO (n-type) can be formed in the C-s-Z composite nanofibers. This leads to the formation of barrier height among the grains and hence increases the nanofibers’ resistance in the absence of target gas, which can finally increase the gas response of the as-prepared sensor. Furthermore, Cr 2 O 3 nanoparticles dispersed in the ZnO nanofibers may enhance the absorption of oxygen ions according to the spill-over effect [26,27] , resulting in the high gas response of C-s-Z nanofibers. On the other hand, Cr 2 O 3 is reported to have poor gas sensing properties, so higher content of Cr 2 O 3 would nearly mask the entire base material-ZnO and would resist the gas to reach up to the active sites, then gas response would decrease further [12] . 4 Conclusions In summary, we have developed an in situ process for sensitizing ZnO based gas sensors by Cr 2 O 3 additives during electrospinning process and subsequent calcination. With the contribution of heterogeneous intergrain boundaries of Cr 2 O 3 –ZnO to the sensitivity and spill-over effect, the best ethanol sensing performance, such as higher response, faster response and recovery, lower detection limit, and reproducibility, are obtained for the sensors based on C-s-Z nanofibers containing 4.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3 . This work presents a simple, effective, and low-cost route to synthesize ethanol sensors. The possibility of large-scale synthesis and excellent sensing properties demonstrate that the C-s-Z nanofibers are very ideal candidates for fabricating ethanol sensors, and the in situ sensitization process by electrospinning will be a promising method for preparing chemical sensors with high performance.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to detect the expression of interleukin-22 (IL-22) and relative CD4(+) T cell subsets in untreated adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and to explore their roles in the pathogenesis of ITP. Fourty adult active ITP patients were enrolled in this study and 40 healthy subjects were taken as control. Plasma IL-22 level was quantified by ELISA. The percentages of Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells in peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry. The Pearson correlation test was used to evaluate correlations between IL-22 level and Th1 cells, Th17 cells and Th22 cell percentages. The results showed that the plasma IL-22 levels in untreated ITP patients [(364.12 ± 94.22) pg/ml] were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P < 0.001). The percentages of both Th1 [(18.92 ± 6.03)%] and Th22 [(2.28 ± 0.51)%] cells in ITP patients were elevated as compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). Elevated plasma concentration of IL-22 positively correlated to the percentages of Th1 (r = 0.42, P = 0.022) and Th22 (r = 0.40, P = 0.030) cells in untreated ITP patients. The percentage of Th17 cells was not significantly different between untreated patients and normal controls, and there was no statistical correlation between the IL-22 level and the percentage of Th17 cells in active ITP patients. It is concluded that elevated IL-22 level correlates to Th1 and Th22 cells percentage, which may play a synergistic effect in the immunopathogenesis of ITP, while Thl7 cells may not be associated with the occurrence of active ITP.",

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an extremely malignant plasma cell disease, which is still incurable due to its drug resistance. Lithium chloride (LiCl) functions in many pathological processes, including bipolar disorder, acute brain injuries, and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, but its antagonistic role in MM progression has not been reported thus far. In this study, we found that LiCl inhibited MM cell proliferation and induced MM cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, LiCl overcomes bortezomib (BTZ)-mediated resistance in MM cells and induces apoptosis in BTZ-resistant cells. Our data preliminarily indicate that LiCl induces MM cell apoptosis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overall, our results define LiCl as an inducer of MM cell apoptosis and unveil a crosstalk between BTZ and LiCl in facilitating cell apoptosis.",

While clean Au(111) surface is catalytically inert and can only weakly adsorb NO, an atomic oxygen precovered Au(111) surface is found to be very active to NO. On the clean surface, NO prefers to bond at the onefold on-top surface site with a tilted geometry. On 0.33 ML (monolayer) oxygen precovered surface NO reacts with chemisorbed oxygen to form chemisorbed NO(2) by conquering a small energy barrier about 0.18 eV, and the desorption energy of NO(2) is 0.64 eV. On 1.0 ML oxygen coverage surface, no barrier is found while NO reacts with precovered oxygen. The desorption energy of NO(2) is 0.03 eV. The desorption of NO(2) is the rate determining step on both surfaces and the overall reaction barriers are 0.64 and 0.03 eV, respectively. The activation energies depend on the initial coverage of oxygen, which compare favorably with experiments on Au surface with different oxygen coverages.",

        "abstract": "To preliminarily study the protective effect of chronic schistosoma japonica (SJ) infestation against sepsis in mice and its mechanism.BALB/c male mice were used, and the experiment was divided into three parts. Experiment 1: chronic SJ infestation model was reproduced by SJ cercaria inoculation through abdominal skin for 8 weeks. Twenty mice were randomly grouped into normal group (n=10) and SJ group (n=10). The levels of interleukins (IL-4, IL-10),tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in serum were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect the levels of IL-10 mRNA and TNF-αmRNA in abdominal macrophages. This experiment was meant to evaluate immune state in mice with chronic SJ infestation. Experiment 2: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was intraperitoneally injected to reproduce sepsis model. Thirty mice were randomly grouped into LPS group (n=15) and SJ-LPS group (n=15). The levels of cytokines were determined by ELISA at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours after LPS injection. This experiment was meant to detect the effect of chronic SJ infestation in mice during the septic process. Experiment 3: two types of sepsis model were reproduced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and LPS injection, respectively. The survival rate of mice with chronic SJ infestation in 72 hours in either type of sepsis was evaluated.Experiment 1: compared with normal group [IL-4 (56.32±8.66) ng/L, IL-10 (48.17±7.23) ng/L], chronic SJ infestation showed an increase in serum IL-4 [(151.35±12.24) ng/L] and IL-10 [(133.22±11.09) ng/L, both P<0.05]. Chronic SJ infestation also resulted in an increase in IL-10 mRNA expression (SJ group 4.46±1.82, normal group 1.52±0.60) and inhibited TNF-α mRNA expression (SJ group 1.61±0.93, normal group 2.32±1.03) in abdominal macrophages (both P<0.05), indicating that macrophages could be differentiated into alternative activated macrophages. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the levels of serum IL-4 and IL-10 were increased at 0 hour after LPS injection, and then gradually decreased in SJ-LPS group, but the levels were still higher than those in LPS group at 72 hours [IL-4 (ng/L): 92.2±7.6 vs. 41.5±4.5; IL-10 (ng/L): 92.1±7.8 vs. 35.6±4.0, both P<0.05]; the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ were increased at 24 hours, and then decreased in SJ-LPS group, and the levels were lower than those in LPS group at 72 hours [TNF-α (ng/L): 82.9±5.6 vs. 91.5±5.2; IFN-γ (ng/L): 44.1±4.8 vs. 52.6±4.0, both P<0.05]. Therefore, chronic SJ infestation could improve the survival rate of mice with sepsis induced by CLP or LPS (CLP: 80% vs. 20%, LPS: 70% vs. 30%, both P<0.05).Chronic SJ infestation could elevate anti-inflammatory factors in septic mice, thus ameliorating the survival rate, so it has protective effect on mice with sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Radix Bupleuri is a traditional Chinese medicine harvested from two Bupleurum species (B. chinense and B. scorzonerifolium). It is widely used and is sourced from different regions of China. 1H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis were applied to 67 Radix Bupleuri samples to discriminate the two species, and explore the influences of habitat and culture method on the quality of Radix Bupleuri based on their metabolomics profiles. Metabolites responsible for the differences between the two species were higher levels of arginine, citric acid, sucrose, saikosaponin b1/b2 analogs, volatile oil with an (E)-2-olefin aldehyde fragment, and fatty acids in B. scoreonerifolium, and more saikosaponin a/c/d analogs in B. chinense. The variances of two cultivation areas were observed due to the higher amount of saikosaponins a/c/d in samples from Shaanxi and lipidsin samples from Shanxi. No obvious difference was detected between cultivars and wild type. 1HNMR metabolomics can simultaneously detect saikosaponins and hydrocarbon aldehydes, and also differentiate the two main saikosaponin skeletons, making it a suitable tool for the species discrimination and quality evaluation of Radix Bupleuri.",

Past efforts to increase graphene’s carrier density via chemical doping have shown limited successes, accompanied by substantial reductions in the mobility caused by disordered dopants. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose to grow graphene on Cu(111) via self-assembly of C5NCl5 molecular precursors to achieve high-density (1/6) and highly ordered nitrogen doping. Such a process relies on the elegant concerted roles played by the London dispersion, chemical, and screened Coulomb repulsive forces in enhancing molecular adsorption, facilitating easy dechlorination, and dictating the overall orientation of the C5N radicals, respectively. Further growth from the orientationally correlated graphene islands is accompanied by significantly minimized density of grain boundaries as the grains coalesce to form larger N-doped graphene sheets, which are further sh...",

        "abstract": "To explore the influence of the lentiviral vector mediated mouse genetic engineering regulatory T cells (Treg) infusion on post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in mice.Lentivirus-mediated Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) gene was transduced into BALB/c mice CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells (Treg) to construct engineered Tregs in vitro. An allo-BMT model of BALB/c to C57BL/6 mice was established. After irradiation, the recipients were injected with donor cells plus the genetic engineering Tregs. Survival time, clinical GVHD score, histopathological findings, activation of donor T cells or serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were observed after allo-BMT.The mean survival times for radiation alone group (Gp I), transplantation control group (Gp II), engineering Treg infusion group (Gp III) and empty vector control group (Gp IV) were (8.8 ± 0.6) d, (36.7 ± 2.5) d, (51.6 ± 4.0) d and (34.1 ± 2.3) d, respectively. The survival time was significantly longer in Gp III than in other groups (P < 0.05). Histopathological finding in several target organs (skin, liver and small intestine) confirmed the presence of severe GVHD in Gp II and Gp IV, while no histological signs of GVHD were observed in long survival recipients in Gp III, and clinical GVHD scores in Gp III were significantly lower than that in Gps II and IV. The numbers of donor T cells and the percentage of IFN-producing donor T cells in the spleen of recipients in Gp III were significant lower than those in Gps II and IV at days 3 and 4, and at day 3 after transplantation, respectively (P < 0.05). The serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α were increased at day 21 to 28 after transplantation in all groups. The peak concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α in Gp III were significantly lower than those in Gps II and IV control groups at day 21 (P < 0.05).Co-injection of genetic engineering Treg can efficiently prevent recipients from lethal GVHD after allo-BMT in mice by inhibiting the early activation and expansion of donor T cells and reducing the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines.",

Although activating strategies, such as defects and composition engineering, have led to remarkable activity gains, there remains the requirement for better performance that aims for real device applications. We report here a phosphorus-doping-induced phase transition from cubic to orthorhombic phases in CoSe. It has been found that the achieved orthorhombic CoSe with appropriate phosphorus dopant (8 wt%) needs the lowest overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm in 1 M KOH, with onset potential as small as -31 mV. This catalyst demonstrates negligible activity decay after 20 h of operation. The striking catalysis performance can be attributed to the favorable electronic structure and local coordination environment created by this doping-induced structural phase transition strategy.",

In this study, the WSE of the wild AR from Shanxi province (SX) and the cultivated AR from Gansu Province (GS) were compared. The WSEs of two types of AR were determined according to the appendix of Chinese pharmacopoeia. Then the WSEs were subjected to NMR analysis, and the obtained data were analyzed using HCA, PCA, OPLS-DA, microarray analysis, and Spearman rank analysis. In addition, the Pearson correlation of differential metabolites were also calculated. The results showed that the WSE content of GS-AR (37.80%) was higher than that of SX-AR (32.13%). The main constituent of WSE was sucrose, and other 18 compounds, including amino acids, organic acids, were also detected. Multivariate analysis revealed that SX-AR contained more choline, succinic acid, citric acid, glutamate, taurine and aspartate, while GS samples contained more sucrose, arginine and fumaric acid. In addition, the Pearson correlations between different metabolites of the two types of AR also showed apparent differences. The results suggested that the WSE of two types of AR differs not only in the content, but also in the chemical compositions. Thus, the cultivation way is important to the quality of AR. This study supplied a new method for the comparison of extract of herbal drugs.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To establish the method for quantitative analysis of quercetin and kaempferide in Flos Farfarae, to determine the contents of quercetin and kaempferide in Flos Farfarae from various habitats, to evaluate the effects of habitats, growth way, and processing on the contents of quercetin and kaempferide in Flos Farfarae, and to establish the fingerprint of flavone glycosides in Flos Farfarae, so as to provide the information for quality control of Flos Farfarae. Methods: Quantification of quercetin and kaempferide in Flos Farfarae was performed by HPLC on Diamonsil C18 column (200 mmX4.6 mm, 5 μm) using acetonitrile-H2O (77:23) as mobile phase and detected at 365 nm. And fingerprint analysis of flavone glycosides in Flos Farfarae was performed by HPLC on ODS-BP C18 column (200 mm X 4.6 mm, 5 μm), eluted with acetonitrile-0.1% H3PO4 gradiently, and detected at 365 nm. Results: The contents of quercetin and kaempferide in Flos Farfarae ralated to the habitats and processing obviously, but unrelated to growth way. The similarity of fingerprints of Flos Farfarae from different habitats and batches was higher. Conclusion: The quantification method of quercetin and kaempferide in Flos Farfarae is convenient, accurate, stable, and could be used for quality control of flavone glycosides in Flos Farfarae. The contents of quercetin and kaempferide are obviously different from various Flos Farfarae: The method of the fingerprint analysis is feasible and reproductive, and could be used as the foundation for study on the fingerprints of flavone glycosides in Flos Farfarae.",

        "abstract": "In order to explore the influence of purified donor regulatory T cells (Treg) infused after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) on GVHD and GVL effect in mice, an EL4 leukemia allo-BMT model of BALB/c-->C57BL/6 mice was established. The CD4(+)CD25(+)T cells were purified by positive selection using MACS. The recipients were injected with CD4(+)CD25(+)T cells or CD4(+)CD25(-)T cells within 4 hours respectively along with allo-BMT. Survival time, clinical GVHD score or histopathological features were observed after allo-BMT. The results showed that the mean survival time in leukemia control group was (17.9 +/- 0.7) days and all mice died of leukemia. The mean survival times in transplantation control group and CD4(+)CD25(-)T group were (23.2 +/- 1.6) and (22.3 +/- 1.9) days. Histopathological analysis in several target organs (skin, liver and small intestine) confirmed the presence of severe GVHD. The mean survival time in Treg group was (47.3 +/- 6.5) days. 70% of recipients were alive until day 60 without features of GVHD or tumor progression. Clinical GVHD scores in Treg group significantly decreased as compared to transplantation control group and CD4(+)CD25(-)T group (p < 0.05). It is concluded that allo-BMT combined with injection of donor CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg cells can efficiently prevent recipients from lethal GVHD with preserving GVL effect during allo-BMT.",

However, the detailed relationship between its spectroscopic features and the GO structural configuration remains elusive. Based on first principles (13)C chemical shift calculations using the gauge including projector augmented waves method, we provide a reliable spectrum-structure connection. The (13)C chemical shift in GO is found to be very sensitive to the atomic environment, even for the same type of oxidation groups. Factors determining the chemical shifts of epoxy and hydroxy groups have been discussed. GO structures previously reported in the literature have been checked from the NMR point of view. The energetically favorable hydroxy chain structure is not expected to be widely existed in real GO samples according to our NMR simulations. The epoxy pair species we proposed previously is also supported by chemical shift calculations.",

Most of VOCs in treated plants had higher contents than those in the control after 1 h treatment and remained much high levels at 2 h.

In this paper, we explored its interesting electronic and magnetic properties with first-principle calculations. Our results show that all Mn ions have high spin states, namely, S = 5/2, and the magnetic couplings between NN and NNN are antiferromagnetic, which agree well with the experimental results. Besides, the surprising results of spin exchange interactions between the NN and NNN are excellently explained with extended Hückel tight-binding calculations. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "GTPase RhoA and its downstream Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinases (ROCKs) are frequently overexpressed in human cancers. Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway blocks angiogenesis mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor, which led us to investigate the role of this pathway in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) - a process by which aggressive cancer cells form vessel-like structures that provide adequate blood supply for tumor growth. We showed that the expression of RhoA and its effector kinases ROCK1/2 was much higher in human osteosarcoma (OS) tissues and the human OS cell line U2OS than in nontumorous tissues and cell line hFOB 1.19 using western blot analysis and real-time PCR. Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway by the pharmacological inhibitor fasudil reduced vascular-like channels of U2OS cells in Matrigel. Furthermore, we used rhodamine-phalloidin immunofluorescence, wound healing assay, and transwell migration assay to examine the effect of fasudil on tumor cell plasticity and motility, both of which play key roles in VM formation. Finally, we explored the underlying mechanisms of fasudil-induced VM destruction. In this context, we showed that the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is a novel regulator in VM of U2OS OS cells and suggest that fasudil in conjunction with established treatments may present a novel therapeutic strategy for OS.",

Plasma obtained from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats treated by CUMS was analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Thirty-seven metabolites were identified among the detected compounds. Subsequent data analysis using the t test and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significant metabolic changes in the rats' plasma after CUMS treatment. Clear separation between the model and control group was achieved, and the level of twelve metabolites, including amino acids, sugar, organic acids and fatty acids, were significantly different between plasma samples from the controls and CUMS group. These observations suggested that the depressed state may be associated with perturbation of amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and glycometabolism. The study suggested that the metabolomics approach could be used as a potential powerful tool to investigate the biochemical change in certain physiopathological conditions, such as depression, as an early diagnostic means.",

Methods The HPLC after pre-treatment of acidification was employed to determine the contents of saikosaponin-a and-d( SSa and SSd) in B. chinense DC. samples and samples from different species. Results The contents of SSa,SSd showed an obvious change after B. chinense DC. samples being introduced. The seeds from Longxi in Gansu province and Lingchuan in Shanxi province had excellent qualities,and the environment factors of Lingchuan in Shanxi province and Taigu in Shanxi province had good effect on the accumulation of SSa,SSd of B. chinense DC. The contents of SSa,SSd in samples of different species were remarkably different,the contents of SSa,SSd were higher in B. chinense DC. than that in Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd. Conclusion The genetic factors and the growth environment of herbs have combined effect on the accumulation of SSa,SSd of B. chinense DC. When B. chinense DC are introduced,excellent germplasm resources should be preferred,moreover,the cultivation adaptation should be investigated in order to ensure the quality. In the clinic,different species of Radix Bupleuri should be used carefully to ensure the stability of efficacy.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to propagate and identify the prdm1 gene-knockout mice, so as to lay the foundation for studying Blimp-1 protein. Two kinds of transgenic homozygous mice with B6.prdm1(flox/flox) and B6.Lck-Cre were feed and propagated; after successful propagating, the first passage mice were obtained; after the first passage mice were copulated once again, the genotypes were obtained as follows: B6. prdm1(wild/wild). Lck-Cre, B6. prdm1(wild/wild), B6.prdm1(flox/flox). Lck-Cre, B6.prdm1(flox/wild). Lck-Cre, B6.prdm1(flox/flox), B6. prdm1(flox/wild). The genomic DNA of second passage mice was extracted, the Cre and loxp gene fragments were amplified by PCR, then the size of Cre and loxp genomic DNA were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. The mice with B6.prdm1(flow/flox). Lek-Cre were used as conditionally prdm1-knockout mice, B6.prdm1(flox/wild). Lck-Cre mice, B6.prdm1(flox/flox) and B6 mice were used as controls. The spleen T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes were sorted by using magnetic beads, the blimp-1 target protein was identified by Western blot. The results showed that the two transgenic homozygous mice had the ability to reproduce, and the separation ratio of second passage mice generated from propagation of their offspring cach other meet Mendelian laws, and the prdm1 gene-knockout mice also could successfully obtained. It is concluded that the application of Cre-loxp system may successfully obtain plentiful prdm1 gene-knockout mice.",

Spin polarized defect states are not affected by the particle sizes and surface decorations, while the band gap is sensitive to these effects. Induced by the spherical surface electric dipole layer, surface functionalization has a long-ranged impact on the stability of charged NV centers doped in NDs. NV- center doped in DNs is more favorable for n-type fluorinated diamond, while NV0 is preferred for p-type hydrogenated NDs.

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from gaseous hydrocarbon sources has shown great promises for large-scale graphene growth. However, high growth temperature, typically 1000 °C, is required for such growth. Here we demonstrate a revised CVD route to grow graphene on Cu foils at low temperature, adopting solid and liquid hydrocarbon feedstocks. For solid PMMA and polystyrene precursors, centimeter-scale monolayer graphene films are synthesized at a growth temperature down to 400 °C. When benzene is used as the hydrocarbon source, monolayer graphene flakes with excellent quality are achieved at a growth temperature as low as 300 °C. The successful low-temperature growth can be qualitatively understood from the first principles calculations. Our work might pave a way to an undemanding route for economical and convenient graphene growth.",

With the sodium ion ordered insulating phase being\nidentified in experiments, pure density functional calculations fail to predict\nan insulating ground state, which indicates that Na ordering alone can not\nproduce accompanying Co charge ordering, if additional correlation is not\nproperly considered. At this level of theory, the most stable phase presents\nferromagnetic ordering within the CoO$_2$ layer and antiferromagnetic coupling\nbetween these layers. When the on-site Coulomb interaction for Co 3d orbitals\nis included by an additional Hubbard parameter $U$, charge ordered insulating\nground state can be obtained. The effect of on-site interaction magnitude on\nelectronic structure is studied. At a moderate value of $U$ (4.0 eV for\nexample), the ground state is antiferromagnetic, with a Co$^{4+}$ magnetic\nmoment about 1.0 $\\mu_B$ and a magnetic energy of 0.12 eV/Co. The\nrehybridization process is also studied in the DFT+U point of view.",

        "abstract": "Using the thermal-desorption cold trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (TCT-GC-MS) technique, the composition and relative\n contents of volatile compounds were analyzed in undamaged (control), insect-damaged (ID) and artificially-damaged (AD) leaves\n of Pinus massoniana in field at different times and levels of damage. Results showed that although volatile substances were highly released earlier\n in AD leaves plants, they were significantly less abundant in AD than in ID leaves treatments. Also, the damage level considerably\n influenced the changes of induced volatile products from leaves. Compared with the control, the emission rate of camphene,\n β-pinene, phellandrene, caryophyllene and (E)-farnesene was high after 1 h in 25%–40% ID-affected leaves, whereas that of tricyclene, myrcene, camphene, β-Pinene, phellandrene and caryophyllene reached its maximum after 24 h in 60%–75% ID-affected leaves. In the same manner,\n some volatile compounds in the AD leaves treatment displayed their peaks just after 1 h, but others after 24 h. The AD and\n ID leaves at the damage level of 25%–40% did not exhibit an obvious regularity with time; however, in 60%–75% AD leaves, peaks\n of volatile substances were attained after 1 or 2 h. Our results also showed that the relative content of β-pinene increased and was higher in damaged than control plants. β-pinene plays an important role in inducing the insect resistance of P. massoniana trees.",

        "abstract": "All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is widely used for induction of complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA also regulates protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Therapeutic use of ATRA reportedly interferes with hemostatic function in APL patients, including effects on coagulation or other vascular cells, although effects of ATRA on platelets remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of therapeutic-relevant doses of ATRA on platelet function. Human platelets were preincubated with ATRA (0-20 μM) for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by analysis of aggregation, granule secretion, receptor expression by flow cytometry, platelet spreading, or clot retraction. Additionally, ATRA (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into mice and tail bleeding time and arterial thrombus formation were evaluated. ATRA inhibited platelet aggregation and adenosine triphosphate release induced by collagen (5 μg/mL) or thrombin (0.05 U/mL) in a dose-dependent manner without affecting P-selectin expression or surface levels of glycoprotein (GP) Ibα, GPVI, or αβ. ATRA-treated platelets demonstrated reduced spreading on immobilized fibrinogen or collagen and reduced thrombin-induced clot retraction together with reduced phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2. In addition, ATRA-treated mice displayed significantly impaired hemostasis and arterial thrombus formation in vivo. Further, in platelets stimulated with either collagen-related peptide or thrombin, ATRA selectively inhibited phosphorylation of PKCßI (Ser661) and PKCδ (Thr505), but not PKCα or PKCßII phosphorylation (Thr638/641). In conclusion, ATRA inhibits platelet function and thrombus formation, possibly involving direct or indirect inhibition of PKCßI/δ, indicating that ATRA might be beneficial for the treatment of thrombotic or cardiovascular diseases.",

To understand this interesting experimental observation, a multiscale \"standing-on-the-front\" kinetic Monte Carlo study is performed. An extraordinary robust geometry effect is identified, which solely determines the growth kinetics and makes the details of carbon-metal interaction not relevant at all. Based on such a geometry-determined mechanism, the epitaxial growth behavior of graphene can be easily predicted in many cases. As an example, the orientation-sensitive growth kinetics of graphene on an Ir(111) surface has been studied. Our results demonstrate that the lattice mismatch pattern at the atomic level plays an important role in macroscopic epitaxial growth. © 2013 American Physical Society.",

The mice were divided into 4 groups: (1) normal control, (2) irradiated group, (3) allo-BMT + DMSO group, (4) allo-BMT + halofuginone (HF) group. HF was given intraperitoneally at 5 µg per mouse from -1 d to +10 d after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation(allo-BMT).Mice aGVHD symptoms and survival were observed. Th1/Th17 cells ratio was evaluated by flow cytometry.All the experimental groups (3) and (4) developed aGVHD after transplantation. More severe aGVHD was observed in group (4) than in group (3). HF prevented cutaneous aGVHD in all the mice, but augmented hepatic and small intestine GVHD. The percentage of Th17 cells and the ratio of Th1/Th17 were significantly higher while the percentage of Th1 cells was significantly lower in group (4) at day +6 (P < 0.05).Early blockage of Th17 cell results in increase of Th1 cell percentage, which exacerbates aGVHD.",

Therefore, it is highly desirable to quantitatively evaluate the carrier mobility of electrene. In this study, e-ph interaction in Ca2N monolayer is investigated using a precise Wannier interpolation-based first principles technique. The calculated e-ph coupling matrix elements of Ca2N monolayer are indeed small compared to other 2D materials such as graphene, which leads to an intrinsic mobility of 189 cm2V-1s-1, much higher than those of conventional metals. Other factors affecting mobility are discussed in a comparison with graphene. It is predicted that, based on a momentum mismatch mechanism, mobility of Ca2N monolayer can be increased further to above 3000 cm2V-1s-1 via hole doping. Our results confirm that Ca2N electrene is a promising electronic material.",

The introduction of inorganic sensitizers (noble metals or inorganic semiconductors) within the conducting polymers-based gas sensors has been regarded as the generally effective route for further enhanced sensors. Here we demonstrate a novel route for highly-efficient conducting polymers-based gas sensors by introduction of polymeric sensitizers (polymeric adsorbent) within the conducting polymeric nanostructures to form one-dimensional polymeric adsorbent/conducting polymer core-shell nanocomposites, via electrospinning and solution-phase polymerization. The adsorption effect of the SPEEK toward NH₃ can facilitate the mass diffusion of NH₃ through the PPy layers, resulting in the enhanced sensing signals. On the basis of the SPEEK/PPy nanofibers, the sensors exhibit large gas responses, even when exposed to very low concentration of NH₃ (20 ppb) at room temperature.",

Methods: The animal experiments were carried on 32 pigs which were divided into two groups. All animals were showed the L2～S1 vertebral discs by the laparoscopic approach, while retroperitoneal and peritoneal cavity approach were adopted for two groups respectively. The efficacy, safety and repeatability between two groups were compared. Results: Through abdominal cavity to show L2～5, the discs were difficult to exposed for severe bleeding. However, retroperitoneal approach provided a clear operative field for operating. The exposure of L6/S1 discs was more difficult adoting retroperitoneal approach than that of abdominal cavity approach. Conclusions: It is feasible to replace artificial lumbar disc nucleus under laparoscope, which is repeatable and safely. It is better to reveal the L5/S1 segment through the peritoneal cavity and to reveal the L2～5 segments by retroperitoneal approach.",

        "abstract": "In addition to hemostatic function, platelets play an important role in regulating the inflammatory response. The platelet NLRP3 inflammasome not only promotes IL-1β secretion, but was upregulated during platelet activation and thrombus formation in vitro. However, the role of NLRP3 in platelet function and thrombus formation in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of NLRP3 in platelet integrin αIIbβ3 signaling transduction. Using NLRP3-/- mice, we showed NLRP3-deficient platelets exhibit no significant differences in expression of the platelet-specific adhesive receptors αIIbβ3 integrin, GPIbα or GPVI, however NLRP3-/- platelets transfused into wild-type mice resulted in prolonged tail-bleeding time and delayed arterial thrombus formation, as well as exhibiting impaired spreading on immobilized fibrinogen and defective clot retraction, concomitant with decreased phosphorylation of c-Src, Syk and PLCγ2 in response to thrombin stimulation. Interestingly, addition of exogenous recombinant IL-1β reversed the defect in NLRP3-/- platelet spreading and clot retraction, and restored thrombin-induced phosphorylation of c-Src/Syk/PLCγ2, whereas an anti-IL-1β antibody blocked spreading and clot retraction mediated by wild-type platelets. Using direct NLRP3 inhibitor CY-09, we demonstrated significantly reduced human platelet aggregation in response to threshold concentration of collagen and ADP, as well as impaired clot retraction in CY-09-treated human platelets, supporting a role for NLRP3 in also regulating human platelet αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. This study identifies a novel role for NLRP3 and IL-1β in platelet function, and provides a new potential link between thrombosis and inflammation, suggesting therapeutic targeting NLRP3 or IL-1β might be beneficial for treating inflammation-associated thrombosis.",

        "abstract": "Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is important for host defens, has been implicated in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. As knockout mice lack IL-17 expression in δγT, NKT-like cells, studies investigating the association between TH17 cells and cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in animal models have reported conflicting results. To determine the role of TH17 cells in cutaneous GVHD, we developed an acute GVHD model using C57BL/6(H-2(b)) donors to BABL/c (H-2(d)) recipients. Blood samples and skin were examined for inflammation and infiltrating cells using histology and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) on days 6 and 15 after bone marrow transplantation. We found donor T cells to mediate severe cutaneous inflammation, which was ameliorater by administration of halofuginone (HF) to the recipients. Mechanistically, we demonstrate the severe tissue damage during this disorder to be associated with the production of IL-17 and the expansion of IL-17-producing CD4(+) cells. Specific inhibition of TH17 differentiation and function by HF reduced disease severity. Thus, TH17 cells are sufficient to induce acute cutaneous GVHD.",

        "abstract": "As a nonspecific alkylating antineoplastic agent, busulfan has been widely used in the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated busulfan-induced cell apoptosis. Whether busulfan triggers platelet apoptosis remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the role of busulfan in platelet apoptosis. Isolated human platelets were incubated with busulfan followed by analysis of platelet apoptosis by flow cytometry or western blot, including mitochondrial depolarization, expression of Bcl-2, and Bax and caspase 3 activation. Meanwhile, platelet activation, expression of glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and <alpha>IIb<beta>3 and platelet aggregation in response to collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were measured. Additionally, busulfan was injected into mice with or without administration of caspase inhibitor QVD-Oph to investigate its effect on platelet lifespan. Our results showed that busulfan-treated platelets displayed increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization, decreased expression of Bcl-2, increased expression of Bax and caspase 3 activation in dose-dependent manner, which were inhibited by QVD-Oph. Platelet activation was not observed in busulfan-treated platelets as showed by no increased P-selectin expression and PAC-1 binding. However, busulfan reduced collagen- or ADP-induced platelet aggregation without affecting expression of GPIbα, GPVI, and <alpha>IIb<beta>3. Furthermore, busulfan reduced circulating platelet lifespan which was ameliorated by QVD-Oph in mice. In conclusion, busulfan triggers mitochondrial-dependent platelet apoptosis and reduces platelet lifespan in mice. These data suggest targeting caspase activation might be beneficial in the prophylaxis of platelet apoptosis-associated thrombocytopenia after administration of busulfan. ",

        "abstract": "This study aims to observe the expression and role of NLRP6 in liver injury after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT model was established through infusion of 5 × 10 bone marrow mononuclear cells into whole body irradiated mice. On days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after transplantation, the peripheral blood was collected to detect liver function. The liver of the mice was obtained to assess the pathological changes of liver tissues after allo-HSCT by H&E staining and Mason staining. Meanwhile, expression of NLRP6, phosphorylated p38-MAPK and IκBα, caspase-1 and NLRP3 in liver were detected by Western blot. ELISA was used for detection of the level of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and tumor growth factor (TGF)-β1. Increased expression of NLRP6, phosphorylated Iκbα, phosphorylated p38-MAPK, pro-caspase-1, and p20, in liver tissue with injury and fibrosis in mice after allo-HSCT were observed. Meanwhile, the level of IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6 and TNF-α was also increased. However, NLRP6 mice showed more severe liver damage and liver fibrosis after transplantation together with higher level of phosphorylated Iκbα, phosphorylated p38-MAPK, Pro-caspase-1, p20 expression as well as IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion compared with wide-type. Interestingly, the expression of NLRP3 in the liver of NLRP6 mice was significantly higher than that of wild-type. In conclusion, the expression of NLRP6 in host's liver is associated with liver injury after allo-HSCT. NLRP6 deficiency in host's liver leads to more severe liver damage, indicating a protective role of NLRP6 in host's liver to liver damage after allo-HSCT.",

        "abstract": "A rapid, highly sensitive, and selective method was applied in a non-invasive way to investigate the antidepressant action of Xiaoyaosan (XYS) using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and chemometrics. Many significantly altered metabolites were used to explain the mechanism. Venlafaxine HCl and fluoxetine HCl were used as chemical positive control drugs with a relatively clear mechanism of action to evaluate the efficiency and to predict the mechanism of action of XYS. Urine obtained from rats subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was analyzed by UPLC-MS. Distinct changes in the pattern of metabolites in the rat urine after CUMS production and drug intervention were observed using partial least squares-discriminant analysis. The results of behavioral tests and multivariate analysis showed that CUMS was successfully reproduced, and a moderate-dose XYS produced significant therapeutic effects in the rodent model, equivalent to those of the positive control drugs, venlafaxine HCl and fluoxetine HCl. Metabolites with significant changes induced by CUMS were identified, and 17 biomarker candidates for stress and drug intervention were identified. The therapeutic effect of XYS on depression may involve regulation of the dysfunctions of energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microflora changes. Metabonomic methods are valuable tools for measuring efficacy and mechanisms of action in the study of traditional Chinese medicines.",

        "abstract": "Summary  Capping ligand adsorption and desorption on crystal facets crucially affects the final crystal size and shape. Herein, based on the competitive adsorption of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and its monomeric analog, cyclopentanone (CPK), we precisely modulate the synthesis of two different elemental nanowires; i.e., single-crystalline Te nanowires and multiple-twinned Pd nanowires. We discover that the similarity between the molecular structure of CPK and the repeating unit of PVP makes the competitive adsorption between them accessible, and the different desorption rates of PVP and CPK result in different crystal growth inhibition effects (strong for PVP and weak for CPK). Thus, the competitive adsorption between PVP and CPK leads to the precise modulation of the growth of these nanowires, which can be further illustrated by density functional theory. This work presents new opportunities to modulate the synthesis of nanocrystals by competitive adsorption between polymer ligands and their monomeric analogs.",

Most of these new congeners exhibited moderate to good activities against the wild-type virus, with EC(50) values in the range of 1.40-0.19 μM. Among them, 2-[(4-cyanophenylamino)carbonylmethylthio]-6-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-5-ethylpyrimidin-4(3H)-one 4 b6 is one of the compounds endowed with the highest broad-spectrum HIV-1 inhibitory activity, with EC(50) values of 0.19±0.005 μM against the wild-type virus, 1.05±0.24 μM (twofold resistance) against the E138K strain, and 2.38±0.13 μM (4.5-fold resistance) against the Y181C strain. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition assays against wild-type HIV-1 RT were performed with selected derivatives, confirming that the main target of these compounds is HIV-1 RT and that these new S-DABO analogues act as non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). Structure-activity relationship and molecular modeling analyses of these new congeners are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is an uncommon chronic myeloproliferative disorder with no cure. Patients with ET are at risk of different complications, and currently there are no optimal prognostic standards to predict severe post-diagnosis complications such as thrombosis and hemorrhage. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the full set of clinical data from 150 Chinese patients with ET enrolled from 2013 to 2016. We discovered that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), along with other known clinical parameters such as age, leukocyte count, incidence of thrombotic events is higher in patients with JAK2 V617F mutation. NLR is also higher in patients at high-risk stratification of thrombosis. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.023-1.089) and JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.003, 95% CI 1.837-21.035) were independent factors for thrombotic events, while age (P = 0.005, 95% CI 1.019-1.111) was the only predictive factor for hemorrhagic events at diagnosis. For future thrombotic events, multivariate analysis revealed NLR as the best predictive parameter (P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.173-1.486) when compared with other clinical parameters such as age (P = 0.037, 95% CI 1.004-1.126), thrombosis at diagnosis (P = 0.036, 95% CI 1.077-9.099) and WBC count (P = 0.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.109). Further ROC curve and Kaplan Meier analysis validated NLR as better prognostic marker for future thrombotic events and thrombosis-free survival. In summary, our data suggest that NLR parameter may possess great prognostic significance for future thrombosis in ET patients.",

        "abstract": "Oxides of two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals have been widely studied due to their unique properties. In most 2D oxides, oxygen acts as a functional group, which makes it difficult to control the degree of oxidation. Because borophene is an electron-deficient system, it is expected that oxygen will be intrinsically incorporated into the basal plane of borophene, forming stoichiometric 2D boron oxide (BO) structures. By using first-principles global optimization, we systematically explore structures and properties of 2D BO systems with well-defined degrees of oxidation. Stable B-O-B and OB tetrahedron structure motifs are identified in these structures. Interesting properties, such as strong linear dichroism, Dirac node-line (DNL) semimetallicity, and negative differential resistance, have been predicted for these systems. Our results demonstrate that 2D BO represents a versatile platform for electronic structure engineering via tuning the stoichiometric degree of oxidation, which leads to various technological applications.",

This phenomenon substantially degrades the quality of SAR images since it may generate unwanted ghost targets in the images. In this study, the authors propose a method consisting of three steps to suppress paired echoes in helicopter-borne SAR imagery based on the characteristics of the helicopter vibration. The proposed method can suppress paired echoes with high efficiency and accuracy in the case of vibrations with varying amplitude. Furthermore, this method does not require the presence of isolated or strong points in a range cell. Both simulated and acquired data are processed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A novel one-dimensional (1D) polymeric heterojunction based on weak-acceptor-polyacrylonitrile/donor-polyaniline core-shell nanofibers is designed for photoconductive devices through electrospinning followed by solution polymerization. Such 1D heterojunction can not only provide the large phase-separated nano-interface for effective charges separation between the cores and shells, but also facilitate the mass charge collection and transport along the nanofiber structure, resulting in greatly enhanced optoelectronic performance. The short 0.1 s response time upon irradiation is among the fastest values, as is the short 0.1 s time for return to the non-irradiated state. Extremely high on-off resistivity ratios (exceeding 4 × 10 4) can be obtained under the drive voltage of only 0.01 V, indicating the energy required for electrical input is very small. Higher drive voltages (a modest 10 V) can provide a very high responsivity of 20 A W -1 driven by 365 nm UV irradiation. Moreover, the as-prepared flexible photoconductive device maintains performance even after bending fatigue tests for bending angles as large as 180°. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Its optical properties are studied and compared with bucky ball C60, C70, and a flat nanographene C 78H30 in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional. The static polarizability ��, first-order hyperpolarizability ��, and second-order hyperpolarizability �� are calculated using the finite field approach. The average values of ������ and ���á� for C80H30 are 151.7 ?3 and 54.5 �� 10-35 esu, respectively, much higher than those of C60 and C70. Both ������ and ���á� of planar C78H 30 are higher than those of C80H30, which is consistent with the fact that the energy gap of C78H30 is smaller than that of C80H30. However, the diagonal component of �� along the z axis of C80H30 is 86.2 ?3, much higher than 30.7 ?3 of C 78H30. Furthermore, the values of the hyperpolarizability in the z direction (��xxzz, ��yyzz, and ��zzzz) of C80H30 are almost 1 order of magnitude higher than those of C78H30. The relationship between optical properties and electron delocalization in molecules indicated by aromaticity is also discussed. Our results indicate that C80H 30 can be used as a promising optical material. ? 2014 American Chemical Society.",

Using a multiscale simulation approach, we unambiguously identified a \"Pac-Man\" cutting mechanism, characterized by the metal nanoparticle \"biting off\" edge carbon atoms through a synergetic effect of multiple metal atoms. By comparing the reaction rates at different types of edge sites, we found that etching of an entire edge carbon row could be triggered by a single zigzag-site etching event, which explains the puzzling linear dependence of the overall carbon-atom etching rate on the nanoparticle surface area observed experimentally. With incorporation of the nanoparticle size effect, the mechanisms revealed herein open a new avenue to improve controllability in graphene cutting.",

        "title": "Metabolic fingerprinting of Tussilago farfara L. using 1H-NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis",
        "abstract": "Introduction The flower bud of Tussilago farfara L. is widely used for the treatment of coughs, bronchitis and asthmatic disorders in traditional Chinese medicine. In Europe, the plant has been used as herbal remedies for virtually the same applications, but the leaves are preferred over flowers. Objective To systematically evaluate the chemical profiles of Tusssilago farfara leaves and flowers along with the identification of the polar and non-polar metabolites. Methodology Metabolic profiling carried out by means of 1H-NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was applied to crude extracts from flowers and leaves. Metabolites were identified directly from the crude extracts through one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra. Results A broad range of metabolites were detected without any chromatographic separation. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of 1H-NMR data provided a clear separation between the samples. The corresponding loadings plot indicated that higher levels of phenylpropanoids, amino acids, organic acids and fatty acids, as well as lower levels of sugars, terpenoids and sterols were present in the leaves, as compared with flowers. For the flowers, more phenylpropanoids were present in fully open flowers, while more sugars and fatty acids were present in flower buds. Conclusion NMR spectra (one- and two-dimensional) are useful for identifying metabolites, especially for the overlapped signals. The NMR-based metabolomics approach has great potential for chemical comparison study of the metabolome of herbal drugs. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, characterized by dysregulation of cellular immunity. Th17 and associated IL-17 were involved in the pathogenesis of ITP. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a member of the runt domain-containing family of transcription factors, is required for Th17 differentiation. Whether RUNX1 was involved in the pathogenesis of ITP remains poorly understood. In this study, 30 active ITP patients, 20 ITP in remission and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated to measure mRNA level of RUNX1 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) by quantitative real-time PCR and Th17 cells by flow cytometry. Meanwhile, plasma was extracted for measurement of IL-17 level by ELISA. Our results showed a significantly higher expression of RUNX1, RORγt, Th17 cells and plasma level of IL-17 in active ITP patients than that in healthy controls. No differences of expression of RUNX1, RORγt and Th17 cells were observed between remission patients and controls. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation of RUNX1 with RORγt was found in active ITP patients. In conclusion, RUNX1 was associated with the pathogenesis of ITP possibly through regulation of Th17 cell differentiation and therapeutically targeting it might be a novel approach in ITP treatment.

        "abstract": "Electrides are a class of materials in which anionic electrons are spatially separated from the positively charged crystalline framework. With such a unique structure, electrides show great potential in various applications, such as superconductivity, electronics, and catalysis. A number of organic and inorganic electrides have been successfully synthesized in experiment, and their novel electronic structures are studied both computationally and experimentally. Computational characterization can provide information which is difficult to be obtained from experiment. In electronic structure calculations, charge density, noncovalent interaction (NCI) index, electron localization function (ELF), and electrostatic potential (ESP) can be analyzed to identify anionic electrons in confined space. On the other hand, theoretical studies can also be used to design new electrides, such as in a recent instance of two-dimensional (2D) electride screening. Alternatively, new applications and novel electron systems based on electrides can be explored theoretically. As an example, based on Ca2N electride, an intrinsic 2D electron gas system in free space (2DEG-FS) has been proposed. With the aid of computational characterization and theoretical design, electride study will continue to be an important field in materials science.

The calculated current-voltage curve shows obvious asymmetric feature with the increasing of the molecular length.

The rectifying effect can be further enhanced by introducing an asymmetric coupling.",

        "abstract": "Halofuginone, isolated from Dichroa febreifuga, is a potent inhibitor of skin collagen in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To evaluate the effect of halofuginone on the development of cutaneous GVHD, we developed a murine model based on BALB/c (H-2d) as recipients with transplantation of C57BL/6(H-2b) bone marrow plus splenocytes. Halofuginone or its vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was given introperitoneally at a dose of 5 ug/mouse daily from one day before transplantation until 20 days post-transplantation. Halofuginone-treated recipients showed only very mild appearance of cutaneous GVHD, whereas DMSO-treated recipients rapidly showed manifestation of severe cutaneous GVHD, indicating a protective effect of halofuginone in cutaneous GVHD. After injected with halofuginone, we observed a decrease in the number of CD4(+) interleukin (IL)-17(+) cells and a parallel increase in that of CD4(+) interferon (IFN)-gamma(+) cells in peripheral blood. This shift between CD4(+) IL-17(+) cells and CD4(+) IFN-gamma(+) cells developed through modulation of cytokine profile indicated by a marked increase in the levels of IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6. The level of IL-10 was not changed obviously. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that severe tissue damage was associated with the production of IL-17 and expansion of CD4(+)IL-17(+) cells during this disorder. Specific inhibition of Th17 differentiation by halofuginone reduced disease severity. Our results indicate a significant role of halofuginone in suppressing cutaneous GVHD, apparently through effect on inhibition of Th17 cells differentiation.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of microRNA-155 (miR-155) on liver injury in mice with sepsis.One hundred and twenty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into two groups of equal number according to random number table. Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS,20 mg/kg). The mice were sacrificed at the time-points of 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 hours. Blood and liver tissue were collected, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α ), interleukin (IL-6, IL-10) in serum and liver homogenate and alanine transaminase (ALT) in serum were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The injury of liver tissue was evaluated by histopathology. The expression of miR-155 in liver tissue was assessed by fluorescent quantitation reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The levels of TNF- α , IL-6 and IL-10 in serum and liver homogenate of septic mice increased with passage of time, and then the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 lowered after reaching the peak value, but remained higher than that of control group.TNF-α (ng/L) reached the peak value at 2 hours post-LPS-injection (serum: 1538.46 ± 102.12 vs. 64.52 ± 18.44,liver homogenate: 255.26 ± 41.23 vs. 60.21 + 13.55, both P<0.05). The level of IL-6 (μg/L) reached the peak value at 6 hours post-LPS-injection (serum: 875.33 ± 102.37 vs. 153.72 ± 20.67, liver homogenate: 9.22 + 0.82 vs. 3.35 ±0.36, both P<0.05), and that of IL-10 (ng/L) reached the peak value at 48 hours post-LPS-injection (serum: 520.13 ± 88.52 vs. 23.43 3.01, liver homogenate: 260.12 + 50.38 vs. 16.37 ± 3.71, both P<0.05). There were significant differences in above indexes between septic and control group (all P<0.05). The serum level of ALT (U/L) rose with passage of time, reaching the peak value at 48 hours post-LPS-injection (603.26 + 70.21 vs. 45.84 + 5.64, P<0.05). The values showed significant differences between septic and control group (P<0.05). A large number of leucocytic infiltration was found in liver. Hepatic tissue showed architectural distortion. Hepatocyte vacuolation and nodular necrosis were obvious at 12 hours post-LPS-injection. Relative expression of miR-155 was found to be increased at 2 hours post-LPS-injection, reaching its peak value at 12 hours post-LPS-injection [(72.96 ± 9.34)-fold of control group, P<0.05].The increase in miR-155 expression might play an important role in the mechanism of liver injury during sepsis.",

For smaller clusters with m, n ≤ 4, all possible combinations of m and n are considered, while for larger clusters in the 5 ≤ m, n ≤ 8 range we only consider the possibilities with |m - n| ≤ 1. Hydrogen bond network formation is an important stabilization mechanism in these clusters. At the same time, proton transfer is generally preferred except in the smallest clusters. Nitric acid and ammonia evaporation rates of these clusters are calculated with both collision activation barriers and reaction thermodynamics explicitly considered. However, unlike in the case of cluster growth from sulfuric acid and ammonia, activation barriers do not play an important role here. If m and n are unequal, evaporation of the abundant species is always preferred. For clusters with m = n > 2, ammonia evaporation is faster than nitric acid. Stabilities of all clusters can be quantitatively evaluated by the evaporation rate of the preferred species. Larger clusters are generally more stable. However, exceptions can occur at structure motif transition point. Deviation from the stoichiometry of m = n significantly lowers the cluster stability. For a cluster pair formed by the same number of molecules, the nitric acid abundant one is more stable, which determines the growth pathway of these clusters.",

        "abstract": "Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a famous Chinese prescription, composed of Radix Bupleuri (Bupleurum chinense DC.), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels), Radix Paeoniae Alba (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.), Poria (Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf), Radix Glycyrrhizae (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), Herba Menthae (Mentha haplocalyx Briq.), and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens (Zingiber officinale Rosc.), has been widely used in the clinic for treating mental disorders. Behavior and biochemical analyses indicate XYS has obvious anti-depression activity. However, there is no report on the effects of XYS using a metabolomics approach.Depression is a prevalent complex psychiatric disorder and its pathophysiological mechanism is not yet well understood. This paper was designed to study metabonomic characters of the depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and the therapeutic effects of XYS, classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating the depression.A plasma metabonomics method based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to classify and reveal the differences between the model group and control group. In turns, the concentration of these differences was analyzed with t-test to determine whether XYS was possible to influence the metabolic pattern induced by CUMS.The significant difference in metabolic profiling was observed from model group compared with drug-dose group by using the PCA, indicating the recovery effect of XYS on CUMS rats. Some significantly changed metabolites like glycine, glucose and hexadecanoic acid have been identified. These biochemical changes are related to the disturbance in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and glycometabolism, which are helpful to further understand the CUMS and the therapeutic mechanism of XYS.Metabonomic approach is helpful to further understanding the pathophysiology of depression and assisting in clinical diagnosis of depression and is also a valuable tool for studying the essence of Chinese medicine's syndrome theory and therapeutic effect mechanism of TCM.",

        "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries, with incidence in Chinese populations also increasing. CLL involves an accumulation of abnormal B cells which result in dysregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis rates. The calcyclin-binding protein/Siah-1-interacting protein (CacyBP/SIP) plays a pivotal role in tumorigenicity and cell apoptosis. Here, we investigated the function of CacyBP/SIP in CLL cell proliferation and apoptosis.CacyBP/SIP expression levels were measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 23 Chinese CLL patients and three healthy donors by western blotting. Correlation analysis was performed to assess associations between CacyBP/SIP expression and clinical stage, chromosome abnormalities and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) expression. We silenced CacyBP/SIP expression in MEC-1 cells using a lentivirus system and analyzed cell vitality, cell cycle and tumorigenicity. Apoptosis was also analyzed following the upregulation of CacyBP/SIP expression in MEC-1 cells.Downregulation of CacyBP/SIP expression in CLL patients was negatively correlated with CLL clinical stage, but not with patient sex, age, del(13q14) or del(17q-) presence, or ZAP-70 expression. CacyBP/SIP silencing significantly enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. CacyBP/SIP silencing promoted accumulation of cells in S phase by upregulation of β-catenin, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and downregulation of p21. Moreover, CacyBP/SIP overexpression facilitated CLL apoptosis through the activation of pro-caspase-3.CacyBP/SIP is a useful indicator of CLL disease processes and plays an important role in sustaining the balance of cell proliferation and apoptosis.",

The morphology and chemical structure of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The results showed that large quantities of In2O3 nanofibers with diameters about from 60 to 100 nm were obtained and the surface of them was decorated with Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm in size). The In2O3 nanofibers decorated by Pt nanoparticles exhibited excellent gas sensing properties to H2S, such as high sensitivity, good selectivity and fast response at relatively low temperature.",

Herein, we identified compound 7594-0035, which is a novel inhibitor that specifically targets c-Myc. It was identified from the ChemDiv compound database by molecular docking-based high-throughput virtual screening. Compound 7594-0035 inhibited MM cell proliferation  , induced cell cycle G2 phase arrest, and triggered MM cell death by disturbing the stability of c-Myc protein. Additionally, we also found that compound 7594-0035 overcame bortezomib (BTZ) drug resistance and increased the killing effect on MM cells in combination with BTZ. The severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mouse xenograft model revealed that compound 7594-0035 partially decreased the primary tumor growth of RPMI-8226 cells  The novel small molecular compound 7594-0035 described in this study that targets c-Myc protein is likely to be a promising therapeutic agent for relapsed/refractory MM.",

Because CK2 is involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways, we wondered whether CK2 participated in the regulation of ionizing radiation (IR) induced biological process. In this study, we investigated the effect of IR on the subcellular localization and kinase activity in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Immunofluorescent results showed that CK2 subunits shuttle into the nucleus mostly begining 1 h after IR and lasting more than 6 h. We also conducted  kinase assay and observed an increase of CK2 kinase activity at 6 h after IR. Furthermore, an increase of S phase was observed at 6 h after IR. Colony formation assay results demonstrated that CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 significantly enhanced the effect of irradiation in NSCLC cells. These results indicated that CK2 may be implicated in the regulation of IR induced biological process.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the changes and its clinical significance of the expressions of the mRNA and protein of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) genes in the myocardium of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) areas in patients who died suddenly due to AMI. Methods: Specimens of myocardial tissue at infarct site was obtained during autopsy from 18 patients who died suddenly due to AMI, and they were enlisted as study group, and that of myocardial tissue from 17 normal hearts of patients died rapidly after accidents were as control group. The levels of mRNA expression of HSP70 and HO-1 genes were measured in all the specimens by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using cDNA samples, and the levels and locations of HSP70 and HO-1 protein expressions in myocardial cells of all specimens were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the pathological changes in the myocardial tissue were observed. Results: The expressions of HSP70 mRNA (0.841 ± 0.058), HO-1 mRNA (0.918 ± 0.161) and HSP70 protein (3 556.68 ± 574.19), HO-1 protein (4 336.68 ± 865.30) in the myocardium of the AMI areas in the study group were significantly higher than those in control group (the expressions of HSP70 mRNA, 0.105 ± 0.034, HO-1 mRNA: 0.086 ± 0.053, HSP70 protein: 289.21 ± 68.51, HO-1 protein: 1 556.78 ± 506.26, all P < 0.01), and a weak expression of HSP70 and HO-1 protein was found in the cardiocytes of the AMI area in study group. In the control group, HSP70 protein expression was negative in the cardiocytes, and there was a weak expression of HO-1 protein in the cardiocytes. There was a significant positive correlation between the expressions of mRNA and protein of HSP70 and HO-1 genes at the cardiocytes of patients died suddenly of AMI in study group (r1 = 0.865, r2 = 0.816, both P < 0.01). Conclusion: HSP70 and HO-1 probably were both involved in the pathological and physiological processes of AMI, while HO-1 may express in cardiocytes, but it is more abundant in the cardiocytes in the AMI area.",

The recombinant vector was transfected into PA317 packaging cells by DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation. The G418 resistant clones were selected, then NIH3T3 cells and T cells were infected by the culture supernatant of the retrovirus containing GFP. The results showed that GFP expression in packaging cell line PA317 was detectable under fluorescence microscope, which demonstrated that the GFP retrovirus were able to infect T cells. It is concluded the retrovirus vectors can introduce a foreign gene into T cells efficiently and can be used as important tools to deliver gene into T cells.",

        "abstract": "Histone acetylation is one of the most abundant post-translational modifications in eukaryotic cells; aberrant histone acetylation is related to a range of cancer types because of the dysregulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Inhibition of HDACs leads to suppression of tumor growth in multiple cancers, whereas the inhibitory effects of HDAC inhibitors remain incompletely understood in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung cancers. In this study, the antitumor effects of HDACs inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat) were examined in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines. The results of the present work showed that SAHA markedly inhibited cell viability and proliferation, induced cell apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, and significantly reduced tumor growth in a xenograft model. Further study confirmed that the suppression function of SAHA might be mediated by regulating the ERK-dependent and/or the AKT-dependent pathway; meanwhile, angiogenesis abrogation induced by SAHA exerted effects on tumor regression in vivo. Taken together, our results identify the antitumor effects of HDACs inhibitor SAHA as an alternative therapeutic application for the epigenetic treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to find metabolites responsible for antitussive and expectorant activities of Tussilago farfara L. by metabolomic approach. Different parts (roots, flower buds, and leaves) of the title plant were analyzed systematically. The in vivo study revealed that the leaves and flower buds had strong antitussive and expectorant effects. Then ¹H NMR spectrometry together with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant (PLS-DA) analysis were used to investigate the compounds responsible for the bioactivities. PCA was used to find the differential metabolites, while PLS-DA confirmed a strong correlation between the observed effects and the metabolic profiles of the plant. The result revealed that chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and rutin may be closely related with the antitussive and expectorant activities. The overall results of this study confirm the benefits of using metabolic profiling for screening active principles in medicinal plants.",

        "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease, which is characterized by abnormal of T immunity. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10, a member of proteinase family, has been demonstrated to regulate T cell proliferation and effector function. Considering the closely association of dysregulation of T cell function with ITP, whether ADAM10 involves in the pathogenesis of ITP remains unclear. In this study, 54 active ITP patients, 18 ITP in remission and 24 age and gender matched healthy control were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients and control for isolation of RNA and plasma which were used to measure mRNA level of ADAM10 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) by quantitative real-time PCR and soluble level of FasL and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) in plasma by ELISA. Meanwhile, T cell activation was measured by flow cytometry. Our results showed significantly higher expression of ADAM10 and lower expression of TIMP3 in active ITP patients compared with control, which were all restored into normal level in remission patients. Consistent with the expression profile of ADAM10, increased soluble plasma level of FasL and LAG-3 were observed in active ITP patients and reduced to normal level in patients in remission. Furthermore, increased T cell activation as demonstrated by higher expression of HLA-DR and CD69 were found in active ITP patients. In conclusion, elevated expression of ADAM10 was associated with the pathogenesis and development of ITP and therapeutically targeting it might be a novel approach for the treatment of ITP.",

An electrophilic molecule introduces acceptor states in the wide gap of BNNT close to the valence band edge, which makes the doped system a p-type semiconductor. However, with typical nucleophilic organic molecules encapsulation, only deep occupied molecular states but no shallow donor states are observed. There is a significant electron transfer from a BNNT to an electrophilic molecule, while the charge transfer between a nucleophilic molecule and a BNNT is negligible. When both electrophilic and nucleophilic molecules are encapsulated in the same BNNT, a large charge transfer between the two kinds of molecules occurs. The resulting small energy gap can strongly modify the transport and optical properties of the system.",

A series of conventional PCF (CPCF) and ultrafine PCF (UPCF) were produced under the identical conditions and UPCF was also modified. Compared to the CPCF, experimental results showed that the UPCF had a better adsorption capacity for SO2 due to its higher surface area and microporous volume. After the modification of the UPCF, adsorption capacities of UPCF for SO2 were improved further via increasing the N-containing amount of UPCF and substrate which was followed by few changes in its specific surface area. The optimum concentration of modified reagent is 10%. From the results of the fatigue test, it has been found that both the UPCF and the modified UPCF showed a good durability.",

        "abstract": "By considering a group of atoms as a whole, the superatom state concept has been proposed to understand complex chemical systems. Superatom states distributed in free space are important in determining the interactions between superatoms and also the reactions of a superatom system with other external molecules. Unfortunately, all free-space superatom states reported to date are unoccupied states, which strongly limit their applications. In this study, we predict that both occupied and unoccupied free-space superatom states exist in an encapsulated CaN nanotube. In this composite system, the inner CaN nanotube provides anionic electrons in free space inside the tube, which form occupied s-, p-, and d-like superatom states. The outer carbon nanotube layer provides an effective protection for these free-space superatom states from the ambient environment. Such protected superatom states with flexible occupation statuses are expected to have a great potential in various application fields including catalysis and electronics.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a new kind of spintronics material, bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMS), has been proposed. The spin polarization of BMS can be conveniently controlled by a gate voltage, which makes it very attractive in device engineering. Now, the main challenge is finding more BMS materials. In this article, we propose that hydrogenated wurtzite SiC nanofilm is a two-dimensional BMS material. Its BMS character is very robust under the effect of strain, substrate or even a strong electric field. The proposed two-dimensional BMS material paves the way to use this promising new material in an integrated circuit.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption of oxygen atoms on the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface is investigated by the use of ab initio total energy density functional methods within the generalized gradient approximation. Considering the repulsive interactions between the adsorbed oxygen atoms, a multiple-layer adsorption model (MLAM), in which the adsorbed oxygen atoms take the sites in different adsorption layers, was used. Our calculated results with a p(2 × 2) unit cell show that the surface face-centered cubic (SFCC) sites are the most favorable sites at the oxygen coverage of 0.25 monolayer (ML). However, the system with one oxygen adatom taking the SFCC sites and the other one taking the octahedral sites between second and third Zr layers (Octa(2,3)) is the most stable configuration at the coverage of 0.50 ML. As the oxygen coverage is increased to 1.0 ML, each of the oxygen atoms prefers taking the SFCC and octahedral sites such as Octa(2,3), Octa(4,5) and Octa(6,7) in the alternate layers, respectively. Our calculated results of the work functions with the MLAM successfully explain the interesting and unusual experimental work function changes upon oxygen adsorption. It should be noticed that the MLAM must be taken into account for oxygen adsorption on the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "Flower bud of Tussilago farfara L. is widely used for the treatment of cough, bronchitis and asthmatic disorders in the Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, due to the increasing demands, adulteration with rachis is frequently encountered in the marketplace. No report demonstrated the chemical and pharmacological differences between flower bud and rachis before.The water extracts were orally administrated to mice. Ammonia induced mice coughing model was used to evaluate the antitussive activity. The expectorant activity was evaluated by volume of phenol red in mice's tracheas. Metabolites were identified directly from the crude extracts through 1D- and 2D-NMR spectra. A metabolic profiling carried out by (1)H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was applied to crude extracts from flower bud and rachis.Flower bud significantly lengthened the latent period of cough, decreased cough frequency caused by ammonia and enhanced tracheal phenol red output in expectorant evaluation. Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded good separation between flower bud and rachis, and corresponding loading plot showed that the phenolic compounds, organic acid, sugar, amino acid, terpene and sterol contributed to the discrimination.These findings provide pharmacological and chemical evidence that only flower bud can be used as the antitussive and expectorant herbal drug. The high concentration of chlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, rutin in flower buds may be related with the antitussive and expectorant effects of Flos Farfara. To guarantee the clinical effect, rachis should be picked out before use.",

        "abstract": "Alkali metal atom adsorption energy is an important descriptor for anode material design. In this study, an energy decomposition model is developed to provide valuable insights in understanding how the adsorption behavior can be tuned. As an example, Li adsorption on graphene enhanced by a tensile strain is analyzed based on this model. Such an analysis then motivates us to find a system with similar electronic structure but larger lattice parameter compared to graphene as an anode material. Our first principles calculations indicate that B2S, as an isoelectronic system of graphene, is a good candidate. Its capacity is as high as 1498 mA h g-1 for both Li and Na ion batteries. Li and Na diffusion barriers on B2S are 0.45 and 0.23 eV, respectively. This study opens a new avenue for adsorption behavior guided two-dimensional material design.",

It is concluded that the flashover voltage of parallel insulator is lower than that of single insulator, while the flashover voltage of V type insulator is almost the same as that of single one. And the fluctuation of flashover voltages is related to the variation of electric field caused by different suspension types.",

        "abstract": "Single-atom catalysts exhibit high selectivity in hydrogenation due to their isolated active sites which ensure uniform adsorption configurations of substrate molecules. Compared with the achievement in catalytic selectivity, there is still a long way to go in exploiting the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts. Herein, we developed highly active and selective catalysts in selective hydrogenation by embedding Pt single atoms in the surface of Ni nanocrystals (denoted as Pt1/Ni nanocrystals). During the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene, the TOF numbers based on surface Pt atoms of Pt1/Ni nanocrystals reached ~1800 h-1 under 3 atm of H2 at 40 oC, much higher than that of Pt single atoms supported on active carbon, TiO2, SiO2, and ZSM-5. Mechanistic studies reveal that the remarkable activity of Pt1/Ni nanocrystals derived from sufficient hydrogen supply because of spontaneous dissociation of H2 on both Pt and Ni atoms as well as facile diffusion of H atoms on Pt1/Ni nanocrystals. Moreover, the ensemble composed of the Pt single atom and nearby Ni atoms in Pt1/Ni nanocrystals leads to the adsorption configuration of 3-nitrostyrene favorable for the activation of nitro groups, accounting for the high selectivity for 3-vinylaniline.",

        "abstract": "In a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, the radar platform may move with a curved trajectory due to the existence of vertical velocity and acceleration, which may result in the failure of the conventional imaging methods. In order to deal with this problem, this paper proposes an improved wavenumber-domain imaging algorithm for high-resolution-high-squint SAR with a curved trajectory. It mainly includes three aspects. First, a modified equivalent range model for a curved trajectory is derived. Second, an improved wavenumber domain imaging algorithm based on the proposed range model is analyzed in detail. Finally, the imaging distortion caused by vertical velocity and acceleration is corrected via geometry and inverse projection. Simulated results and Ku-band real SAR data processing are used to validate the proposed model and imaging algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This randomized trial was performed to investigate the efficacy of low-dose rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids for treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Sixty-two patients were randomly separated into the glucocorticoids (control) and the experimental (glucocorticoids + rituximab) groups. Patients in both groups received dexamethasone 40 mg/day on days 1-4, followed by decrements of prednisone 60, 30, 15, 10 mg/day on days 5-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, respectively. Patients in the experimental group also received rituximab 100 mg on days 7, 14, 21, 28. The overall response (OR) was similar in both groups at day 28 (experimental group vs. glucocorticoids group: 80.6 vs. 74.2%, P = .938); however, sustained response (SR) was more pronounced in the experimental group as compared to that in the glucocorticoids group (77.4 vs. 38.7%, P < .001). Both groups showed similar incidence of adverse events (experimental group vs. glucocorticoids group: 9.7 vs. 6.5%, P = .325). As expected, B cell depletion was seen in the experimental group. In addition, both groups experienced a significant up-regulation in Treg cell levels, but the up-regulation in the experimental group was maintained at an even higher level and persisted a longer time than those in the glucocorticoids group. Thus, low-dose rituximab combined with short-term glucocorticoids provides an alternative treatment for ITP prior to splenectomy.",

The structures and the physicochemical properties of m-TiO 2 NFs are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis, and determination point of zero charge, respectively. An investigation of Cu(II) adsorption onto m-TiO 2 NFs has been studied in this research. The pH effect, adsorption kinetics, and adsorption isotherms are examined in batch experiments. Experimental data were analyzed using pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models. It was found that adsorption kinetics were the best fitting by a pseudo-second order kinetic model. The optimum pH for Cu(II) adsorption was found to be 6.0. The equilibrium data were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models, which revealed that the Freundlich isotherm is the best-fit isotherm for the adsorption of Cu(II). Compared to the TiO 2 NFs (regular anatase titanium nanofibers) in the same experimental conditions to elucidate the role of the mesoporous structure of m-TiO 2 NFs, experimental results showed that the m-TiO 2 NFs had a better adsorption capacity for Cu(II) due to its higher surface area. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "Lignin is an important substance in defense attacks of herbirore in plants. After Pinus massioniana trees were damaged by Dendrolimus punctatus Walker, lignin contents, peroxidase activity and its isoenzyme were analyzed respectively at different times. Results indicated that lignin contents compared with the control, increased slightly at 1h from insect-damaged leaves (IDL). Instead of systemic leaves (SL) enhanced after 10 hrs. Lignin contents and peroxidase activities reached their maximum after 24hrs. Furthermore, their differences gradually enhanced with times, which were reflected in expression quantities. F test showed that lignin content corresponded with peroxidase activity and peroxidase isoenzyme changes in damaged P. massoniana needles and displayed difference significantly in 24h P < 0.05).",

        "abstract": "To investigate the osteoblasts effect, complications and influencing factors in the application of small freeze-drying allogeneic bone plots mixed autologous bone fragments in spinal surgery, and to compare with autogenous bone graft.From January 2003 to January 2007, 515 cases of spinal injuries were treated. A total of 324 cases were treated with small freeze-drying allogeneic bone plots mixed with autologous bone grafts (group A), including 211 males and 113 females with an average age of 36 years (18-83 years). There were 182 cases of thoracolumbar vertebra fracture, 68 cases of lumbar spondylolisthesis, 47 cases of lumbar vertebral canal stenosis, 17 cases of cervical disc herniation, 5 cases of cervical spine fracture-dislocation and 5 cases of thoracolumbar vertebra tumor. The weight of bone graft was 10-60 g (mean 30 g). A total of 191 cases were treated with autogenous bone grafting (group B), including 135 males and 56 females with an average age of 32 years (23-78 years). There were 109 cases of thoracolumbar vertebra fracture, 23 cases of lumbar spondylolisthesis, 17 cases of lumbar vertebral canal stenosis, 19 cases of cervical disc herniation, and 23 cases of cervical spine fracture-dislocation. The weight of bone graft was 10-50 g (mean 25 g).In group A, effusion of wound increased in 4 cases and the result of bacterial culture was negative; effusion was absorbed after 2 weeks of local irrigation, drainage and cortin management. In group B, no obvious effusion was observed. The follow-up time was 10-36 months (mean 17.4 months) in group A and 8-36 months (mean 16.8 months) in group B. The bone healing was achieved in 308 cases within 4-10 months (mean 8.1 months) and in 184 cases within 4-10 months (mean 5.8 months), and the bone fusion rates were 95.06% and 96.34% in groups A and B, respectively. There was no significant difference in bone fusion rate between groups (P > 0.05). According to Mankin and Komender evaluation standard, the response rates were 95.06% and 96.34% in groups A and B, respectively, showing no significant difference (P > 0.05).Mix-bone grafting has the same effective to autologous bone grafting in bone fusion rate. It could be used as the supplement of the autologous bone inadequacy.",

The gene was comprised of 639 base pairs in the length, deduced 212 amino acids (aa), contained a SOCS box (aa172-aa208), a SH2 domain (aa80-aa155) and a nuclear localization sequence (aa160-aa174). The primary structure contained two linear B cell epitopes, all of them were on the surface of the protein and far away from the spatial structure.SOCS-1 gene has a polymorphism, its conservative SH2 region and SOCS box are related to its inhibitory effect on the signal transduction pathway. The nucleic localization sequence may affect other nuclear transduction factors. The B cell linear epitopes may be a candidate of immunodiagnosis with promising prospects.",

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have the capacity to differentiate into endothelial cells and play a critical role in vasculogenesis, tissue regeneration and repair. Whether EPCs infusion ameliorates LSECs injury remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EPCs on liver injury in mice after HSCT.Mice received HSCT without or with EPCs infusion (HSCT + EPCs). Untreated mice were used as control. Liver and whole blood were collected post HSCT and used for the analysis of pathology of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes, liver ultrastructure, function, level of IL-6, TNF-α and platelet activation.Severe LSECs injury, hepatocyte damage, abnormal liver function was observed in HSCT group. In addition, increased P-selectin expression and secretion of IL-6, TNF-α was also found. However, all the above changes were alleviated in HSCT + EPCs at all the time points and normalized at the endpoint. Meanwhile, EPCs-induced repair of LSECs and hepatocytes was totally inhibited by the addition of anti-VE-cadherin antibody.EPCs infusion ameliorated the damage to LSECs and hepatocytes as well as reduced secretion of IL-6, TNF-α and inhibited platelet activation after HSCT, leading to improved liver function, suggesting EPCs might be a new therapeutic strategy in the prophylaxis of liver injury after HSCT.",

        "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, characterized by accelerated platelet destruction/clearance or decreased platelet production. ADAM17-mediated platelet receptor GPIbα extracellular domain shedding has been shown to be involved in platelet clearance. Whether GPIbα shedding participates in the pathogenesis of ITP remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the role of GPIbα shedding in the development of ITP via incubating normal platelets with ITP plasma to mimic ITP in vivo environment. Plasma was isolated from ITP patients or healthy control and incubated with platelets in vitro followed by measuring GPIbα expression by flow cytometry and western blot, ADAM17 expression by western blot, ROS generation and platelet activation by flow cytometry. Compared with control plasma, ITP plasma-treated platelet displayed significantly reduced GPIbα surface expression, increased ADAM17 expression and ROS generation. However, metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 blocked the ITP-plasma-induced decrease in GPIbα surface expression, increase in ADAM17 expression and platelet activation. In addition, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase or mitochondria respiration significantly inhibited ROS generation from ITP plasma-treated platelets. Moreover, ROS inhibition or blocking FcγRIIa attenuated the decrease in GPIbα surface expression, platelet activation and ROS generation (for blocking FcγRIIa) in ITP plasma-treated platelets. In conclusion, ITP plasma induces platelet receptor GPIbα extracellular domain shedding, suggesting that it might participate in the pathogenesis of ITP and targeting it might be a novel approach for treating ITP.",

        "abstract": "To observe the effect of Wnt3a-transduced mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on the proliferation of T lymphocytes.MSC were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow and expanded in vitro, then identified by flow cytometry and their differentiation capacity into osteocytes and adipocytes were determined. Recombinant plasmids containing Wnt3a gene, were transfected with lipofectamine into HEK293 cells by the AdEasy system. Viral particles were collected to infect MSC and adenovirus vector expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) was used as control. The expression of GFP in MSC was observed using fluorescence microscopy and the protein levels of Wnt3a and β-catenin were determined by Western blot. Wnt3a-transduced and Ad-GFP transduced MSC were separately cocultured with spleen lymphocytes stimulated by ConA, at the ratio of 1:100, 1:50 or 1:10 respectively. The proliferation rate of T lymphocytes was estimated by Cell Cout Kit-8 (CCK-8) and the level of cytokine by ELISA.FCM analysis showed that the MSC were highly positive for CD90.2, CD44 and negative for CD34, CD45, they could differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes after induction; The titer of recombinant adenoviruses was up to 1 × 10(10) pfu/ml. After infected with the adenoviruses, MSC had the strongest GFP expression at 72 h and the efficiency of infection was 50%-60%. The expressions of Wnt3a and β-catenin protein in the Wnt3a-transduced MSC were significantly increased. MSC could suppress the proliferation of T lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. When MSC cocultured with spleen lymphocytes at 1:10 ratio, T lymphocyte proliferation rate and the level of IFN-γ were (55.41 ± 1.75)% and (326.70 ± 14.41) pg/ml respectively in Ad-GFP transduced MSC group, while in Wnt3a-transduced MSC group, they were (37.27 ± 2.66)% and (218.80 ± 12.93) pg/ml respectively. There was no effect on the production of IL-2.Compared to Ad-GFP transduced MSC, Wnt3a-transduced MSC exhibit a more potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of T lymphocytes.",

The experiments were designed as follows: control group (group A), CsA prophylaxis group (group B), THH prophylaxis group (group C), and combined THH with CsA prophylaxis group (group D). aGVHD was assessed by histologic changes of skin, liver and intestines. Chimerism was detected by H-2b molecular expression on recipient mice bone marrow cells with flow cytometer. Serum concentrations of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 were determined by ELISA.The serum concentrations of IFN-gamma in group B, C, D were significantly lower than that in group A, while those of IL-10 was significantly higher than that in group A (P < 0.05). There was no changes in concentration of IL-4 in all the groups (P > 0.05). The median survival time for group A was nine days, while that of group B, C, D each was more than 30 days being significantly longer than that of group A (P < 0.05). The recipient mice of group A displayed significant clinical symptoms of GVHD, and died within 20 days; whereas those of group B, C, D showed only ruffled fur and uplift posture. Histologic changes of liver and intestines in group B and C displayed a few lymphocytes infiltration while the histologic morphology of skin, liver and intestines in the survived mice of group D was normal. Allogeneic chimerism rates of group B, C, D at day 30 after allo-BMT were (99.18 +/- 0.58)%, (97.68 +/- 0.59)%, and (99.15 +/- 0.11)%, respectively.THH could regulate the production of cytokines and prevent aGVHD. THH and CsA at low dose combination showed synergic effect in preventing aGVHD.",

The widely accepted Lerf model gives most experimental IR characteristics correctly except the strong C=O stretching peak. This is a result of the absence of carbonyl groups in the interior part of GO. Defects or small oxidative debris should thus be introduced into GO models to accommodate more carbonyl groups. Unfortunately, even for those with defects or oxidative debris included, most previous models in the literature still fail to give a correct IR response. Actually, the C=O stretching frequency is found to be very sensitive to local chemical environment. Therefore, to introduce defects or oxidative debris into GO models, certain constrains apply.",

        "abstract": "Epitaxial growth is a promising strategy to produce high-quality graphene samples. At the same time, this method has great flexibility for industrial scale-up. To optimize growth protocols, it is essential to understand the underlying growth mechanisms. This is, however, very challenging, as the growth process is complicated and involves many elementary steps. Experimentally, atomic-scale in situ characterization methods are generally not feasible at the high temperature of graphene growth. Therefore, kinetics is the main experimental information to study growth mechanisms. Theoretically, first-principles calculations routinely provide atomic structures and energetics but have a stringent limit on the accessible spatial and time scales. Such gap between experiment and theory can be bridged by atomistic simulations using first-principles atomic details as input and providing the overall growth kinetics, which can be directly compared with experiment, as output. Typically, system-specific approximations should be applied to make such simulations computationally feasible. By feeding kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations with first-principles parameters, we can directly simulate the graphene growth process and thus understand the growth mechanisms. Our simulations suggest that the carbon dimer is the dominant feeding species in the epitaxial growth of graphene on both Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, which enables us to understand why the reaction is diffusion limited on Cu(111) but attachment limited on Cu(100). When hydrogen is explicitly considered in the simulation, the central role hydrogen plays in graphene growth is revealed, which solves the long-standing puzzle into why H should be fed in the chemical vapor deposition of graphene. The simulation results can be directly compared with the experimental kinetic data, if available. Our kMC simulations reproduce the experimentally observed quintic-like behavior of graphene growth on Ir(111). By checking the simulation results, we find that such nonlinearity is caused by lattice mismatch, and the induced growth front inhomogeneity can be universally used to predict growth behaviors in other heteroepitaxial systems. Notably, although experimental kinetics usually gives useful insight into atomic mechanisms, it can sometimes be misleading. Such pitfalls can be avoided via atomistic simulations, as demonstrated in our study of the graphene etching process. Growth protocols can be designed theoretically with computational kinetic and mechanistic information. By contrasting the different activation energies involved in an atom-exchange-based carbon penetration process for monolayer and bilayer graphene, we propose a three-step strategy to grow high-quality bilayer graphene. Based on first-principles parameters, a kinetic pathway toward the high-density, ordered N doping of epitaxial graphene on Cu(111) using a CNCl precursor is also identified. These studies demonstrate that atomistic simulations can unambiguously produce or reproduce the kinetic information on graphene growth, which is pivotal to understanding the growth mechanism and designing better growth protocols. A similar strategy can be used in growth mechanism studies of other two-dimensional atomic crystals.",

Based on fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green’s function\n method and density functional theory, we study the electron transport properties of the molecular junction with a dipyrimidinyl-diphenyl\n (PMPH) diblock molecule sandwiched between two gold electrodes. Effects of different kinds of molecule-electrode anchoring\n geometry and protonation of the PMPH molecule are studied. Protonation leads to both conductance and rectification enhancements.\n However, the experimentally observed rectifying direction inversion is not found in our calculation. The preferential current\n direction is always from the pyrimidinyl to the phenyl side.

Within the framework of generalized gradient approximation (GGA), [Tc(Bz)]∞ is a ferromagnetic half-metal, and [Nb(Bz)]∞ is a ferromagnetic metal. With the on-site Coulomb interaction for 4d TM atoms being taken into account, [Tc(Bz)] ∞ keeps a robust half-metallic behavior, while [Nb(Bz)] ∞ becomes a spin-selective semiconductor. The stability of the half-metallic [Tc(Bz)]∞ polymer is discussed based on magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Compared with 0.1 meV per metal atom in [Mn(Bz)] ∞, the calculated MAE for [Tc(Bz)]∞ is 2.3 meV per metal atom. Such a significantly larger MAE suggests that Tc(Bz)] ∞ is practically more promising than its first-row TM equivalent. © 2009 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",

Some studies found that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were involved in the pathogenesis of some inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease. But the expressions of SOCS in coronary heart disease have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in the myocardium of patients with sudden cardiac death (SCD).Myocardial autopsy specimens were collected from 24 patients at the Forensic Medicine Department of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China between 2005 and 2006. Of them, 9 patients had autopsy findings consistent with coronary atherosclerosis (non-myocardial infarction) leading to SCD (non-MI group), 7 died of acute myocardial infaction (MI group), and 8 died from traffic accidents and trauma (control group). The expressions of SOCS-1 mRNA and SOCS-3 mRNA in the myocardium of the non-MI, MI and control groups were detected using RT-PCR. The levels of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 proteins were detected using immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 software and the data were analyzed by ANOVA.The expressions of SOCS-1 mRNA and SOCS-3 mRNA in the non-MI and MI groups were significantly higher than those in the control group[(0.788±0.101), (0.741±0.111) vs. (0.436±0.044), (P<0.01); (0.841±0.092), (0.776±0.070) vs. (0.454±0.076), (P<0.01)] respectively. The antibody-positive cells of SOCS-1 protein in the myocardium of the non-MI and MI groups were significantly higher than those in the myocardium of the control group[(320.00±48.48), (347.14±70.88) vs. (42.50±10.35), (P<0.01)] respectively. The antibody-positive cells of SOCS-3 protein in the myocardium of the non-MI and MI groups were significantly higher than those in the myocardium of the control group[(381.11±59.25) vs. (40.00±10.69), (P<0.01)] and[(332.86±111.91) vs. (40.00±10.69), (P=0.001)].The expressions of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in the myocardium of patients with SCD from coronary heart disease are significantly increased and contribute to the pathogenesis of SCD.",

        "abstract": "A nano-gas sensor based on Pd–SnO 2 composite nanofibers is fabricated by electrospinning technique and calcination procedure. The morphology, structure and composition of the as-prepared nanofibers are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The nano-gas sensor shows excellent hydrogen sensing properties such as high sensitivity and extremely fast response–recovery behavior (∼9 s) at a lower operation temperature (280 °C). The detection limit of approximately 4.5 ppm H 2 is demonstrated. The function of adding Pd into the SnO 2 nanofibers and the sensing mechanism have also been discussed in this work. Keywords Pd Tin oxide Nanofibers Hydrogen Sensor 1 Introduction Hydrogen, as a renewable, abundant, efficient energy source, has been extensively investigated in the application of new energy sources [1–3] . However, hydrogen is colorless, explosive, and extremely flammable in the air. Consequently, a variety of robust and safety sensors are being developed for the reliable and continuous monitoring of H 2 , particularly for combustion gas detection and fuel leak detection in spacecraft, autos and aircraft, fire detectors, and industrial process emissions [4–7] . Recently, the synthesis of hydrogen sensors based on wide bandgap semiconductors such as ZnO, SnO 2 , TiO 2 and GaN has gained special focus owing to their sensitivity to surface charge and wide temperature stability [8–12] . Among these materials, SnO 2 is the most popular and commercial one for the development of resistive gas sensors. Till now, various SnO 2 structures such as sintered powders [13] , thin and thick films [14,15] , nanoparticles [16] , nanowires [17] , and nanosheets [18] are fabricated and applied in gas sensors. However, most of those gas sensors suffer from relatively low sensitivity or long response/recovery time [13–18] . Palladium (Pd) is a widely used catalyst for improving the selectivity and sensitivity of SnO 2 sensors to H 2 [19–24] . On the other hand, taking the advantages of large surface-to-volume ratio and unique electric properties based on one-dimensional nanostructures, many efficient gas sensors have been developed based on one-dimensional nanostructures [25–29] . Among the different methods for the fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures, electrospinning has received considerable attention because of its simplicity and versatility [30,31] . Hitherto, several gas sensors have been successfully obtained for the detection of methanol [32] , ethanol [33] , humidity [34] and toluene [35] via electrospinning. But few H 2 sensors based on electrospun nanofibers have been reported previously [36] . In this paper, Pd-doped SnO 2 nanofiber has been fabricated via electrospinning technique and calcination process. The as-prepared nanofibers exhibit high sensitivity and ultra-fast response–recovery property. These results demonstrate a promising approach in development and realization of a low cost and high-performance hydrogen sensor. 2 Experiment details 2.1 Chemicals Ethanol (>95%), N,N-dimethyl formamide (>95%) and SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O were purchased from Tianjin Chemical Co. (China). PdCl 2 was purchased from Beijing Chemical Co. (China). Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 1,300,000) was purchased from Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification. 2.2 Preparation of Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers In a typical procedure, 0.4 g of SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O was dissolved in 4.4 g of DMF and 4.4 g of ethanol under vigorous stirring for 10 min. Subsequently, 0.8 g of PVP and 12 mg of PdCl 2 were added into the above solution under vigorous stirring for 30 min. The mixture was electrospun (voltage: 12 kV; distance between anode and cathode: 20 cm) and followed by sintering at 600 °C for 5 h. The concentration of Pd in the final product was 3 wt%. The pure SnO 2 nanofibers were also obtained with no addition of PdCl 2 by the same procedure. 2.3 Fabrication and measurement of H 2 gas sensor based on our products The as-prepared nanofibers were mixed with deionized water in a weight ratio of 100:25 to form a paste. The paste was coated onto a ceramic tube on which a pair of gold electrodes was previously printed, and then a Ni–Cr heating wire was inserted in the tube to form a side-heated gas sensor. Gas sensing properties were measured using a static test system. Saturated target vapor was injected into a glass test chamber (20 L in volume) by a syringe through a rubber plug. After fully mixed with air (relative humidity was about 25%), the sensor was put into the test chamber. When the response reached a constant value, the sensor was taken out to recover in air. The electrical properties of the sensor were measured by the CGS-1 intelligent test system (Beijing Elite Tech Co. Ltd., China). The sensor response was measured between 200 and 340 °C. The sensor response is defined as the ratio Ra / Rg , where Ra is the resistance in dry air, and Rg is the resistance in test gas. The time taken by the sensor to achieve 90% of the total resistance change was defined as the response time in the case of adsorption or the recovery time in the case of desorption. 2.4 Characterization Nanofibers were characterized by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM, SSX-550, Shimadzu) transmission electron micrographs (TEM, Hitachi S-570), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation). Analysis of the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed on an ESCLAB MKII using Al as the exciting source. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphological and structural characteristics of our products Fig. 1 a and b shows the typical SEM images of pure SnO 2 nanofibers and Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers, respectively, indicating diameters of the as-prepared nanofibers for all the samples are ranging from 80 to 120 nm. Further morphology characterization of our products was examined by TEM and shown in Fig. 1 c and d, which indicated that the fibers have a rough surface due to the loss of PVP from the nanofibers. Those TEM images also show that both of the pure SnO 2 nanofibers and Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers are indeed composed of many interconnected grains of around 30 nm in size. Fig. 2 a shows XRD patterns of the pure SnO 2 nanofibers and Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers. All the strong diffraction peaks of both samples can be perfectly indexed as the tetragonal rutile structure for SnO 2 (JCPDS 41-1445). But there is no indication of the presence of any dopants-related diffraction peaks for the Pd-doped sample, attributing to the high dispersion or the poor crystallinity of dopants-related nanoparticles. To further prove the existence of Pd component in Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers, XPS has been used to investigate the composition and the chemical state of the elements existed in the as-prepared Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers, and the spectra are illustrated in Fig. 2 b. The Pd 3d spectrum exhibited a doublet feature at 342.7 eV (Pd 3d 3/2 ) and 336.8 eV (Pd 3d 5/2 ). These peaks correspond to the Pd 2+ oxidation state [37] and Pd therefore exists as PdO in the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers. All of these results give the insight that the nanofibers are composed of PdO and SnO 2 . 3.2 Sensing properties The optimal operating temperature of the sensors for detecting H 2 is an important issue, and it was obtained by performing the gas sensing experiments at different temperatures. Before exposing to the target gas, each sensor was stabilized for 2 h at the working temperature. Fig. 3 a presents responses to 100 ppm of H 2 for the pure SnO 2 nanofibers and Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers samples. For the pure SnO 2 nanofibers sensor, the response increases with a raise of operating temperature and reaches its maximum (about 4) at 320 °C, then decreases rapidly with increasing temperature. On the contrary, the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers show higher response value (about 8.2) with respect to pure SnO 2 at lower temperature (280 °C). It is known that PdO can be reduced by H 2 and form PdHx at a relatively low temperature [38] . In our case, when hydrogen is passed over the PdO/SnO 2 nanofibers, Pd was formed from PdO via PdHx at low temperature. Then the Pd metal induces the surface and lattice oxygen reductions of Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers at much lower temperatures, in contrast to the pure tin oxide. The concentration dependence of pure SnO 2 nanofibers and Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers was investigated in the range of 20–15,000 ppm H 2 and the plots of the gas response against the gas concentration are shown in Fig. 3 b. As for the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers, the results clearly indicate that even the lowest concentration of H 2 , i.e. 20 ppm, the response is more than 3. The response value increases rapidly with increasing H 2 concentration at first (below 5000 ppm). Above 5000 ppm, the response slowly increases with increasing H 2 concentration. Although the similar trend was also observed for pure SnO 2 nanofibers, the responses were much weaker, which indicate a much lower sensitivity compared with the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers. In addition, a low detection limit of the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers is found to be around 4.5 ppm according to Fig. 3 b, while the detection limit of pure SnO 2 nanofibers is about 25 ppm which is more than 4 times of that of the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers. The detection limit is defined as the concentration at which response is ∼1.1, corresponding to 10% change of resistance. There are several reasons which should be considered to explain the improvement of the nanofibers’ sensing performance upon PdO doping. To describe the sensitization mechanism more clearly, we present a simple model in Fig. 4 . As shown in the schema, the whole process can be divided into three steps. Step 1 is the dissociation of molecular oxygen on the sensor surface ( Fig. 4 a). In this step, the PdO nanoparticles play a role as catalyst for activating the dissociation of molecular oxygen, the atomic products then diffuse to the metal oxide support. This step greatly increases both the quantity of oxygen that can repopulate vacancies on the SnO 2 surface and the rate at which this repopulation occurs, resulting in a greater and faster degree of electron withdrawal from the SnO 2 than for the pure SnO 2 nanofibers (Pd is a far better oxygen dissociation catalyst than SnO 2 ) [39,40] . This step is well-established in the catalysis literature and known as the “spill-over” effect. When hydrogen is introduced, PdO is reduced to metallic palladium, returning electrons to SnO 2 , which is defined as Step 2 ( Fig. 4 b). In Step 3 ( Fig. 4 c), hydrogen molecules adsorbed on palladium simultaneously spill-over the surface of SnO 2 , activating the reaction between hydrogen and the adsorbed oxygen [38] . In this step, the dissociation of H 2 at the Pd surface forms atomic H that leads to additional reaction schemes [41] . Reviewing the basic reaction scheme between adsorbed oxygen species on the SnO 2 surface and molecular H 2 is a single step process presented below (1) H 2 (g) + O ad − (SnO 2 ) → H 2 O(g) + (SnO 2 ) + e − With the dissociation of H 2 at the Pd surface, additional reaction schemes are supplied (2) H 2 (g) → H + H(dissociation) (3) H + SnO 2 → H ad (SnO 2 ) (4) H ad (SnO 2 ) + O ad − (SnO 2 ) → OH ad − (SnO 2 ) (5) OH ad − (SnO 2 ) + H ad (SnO 2 ) → H 2 O(g) + (SnO 2 ) + e − In these reaction paths, H 2 O(g) is liberated as the final reaction product, resulting in accumulation of electrons at the surface which is responsible for the conductance increase, hence the better sensitivity to H 2 of the Pd–SnO 2 nanofiber sensor than pure SnO 2 nanofiber. It is well known that response and recovery characteristics are important for evaluating the performances of hydrogen sensors. To investigate the response–recovery behaviors of the Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers sensor, the sensor was sequentially exposed to 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 ppm H 2 at 280 °C. The sensor exhibits high response and fast response and recovery to H 2 , as shown in Fig. 5 . The response and recovery times are very short and change slightly with changing H 2 concentration. When exposed to H 2 with different concentrations, the response and recovery times are about 9 s. The extremely fast response and recovery behavior can be attributed to the one-dimensional nanostructure of Pd–SnO 2 nanofibers. It can facilitate fast mass transfer of the hydrogen molecules to and from the interaction region as well as improve the rate for change carriers to transverse the barriers along the fibers [34] . 4 Conclusions Pd–SnO 2 composite nanofibers have been fabricated via electrospinning and calcination. The as-prepared samples were evaluated for their gas sensing properties towards H 2 . A maximum response value of 8.2 and extremely fast response–recovery behavior are obtained for 100 ppm H 2 detection at 280 °C, which exhibited better responses and lower operating temperature than that of the pure SnO 2 nanofibers. These results demonstrate a promising approach in development and realization of a low cost and high-performance hydrogen sensor.

        "abstract": "Several large randomized clinical trials show that chemotherapy in combination with interferon-α (IFN-α) seems superior to single-agent chemotherapy, such as dacarbazine (DTIC) in melanoma, but the molecular mechanism of this better efficacy is unclear. IFN-α has antiangiogenic activity and could downregulate expression of regulator of G-protein signalling-5 (RGS5) recognized as a novel pericyte marker and a master gene loss of which results in pericyte maturation, vascular normalization, and consequent marked reductions in tumor hypoxia and vessel leakiness in pancreatic carcinoma. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of this combination therapy on melanoma tumor growth. In B16 tumor-bearing mice, the addition of IFN-α to DTIC treatment significantly reduced tumor volume, compared with control or DTIC alone. Consistently, Digital Radiography data showed less chaotic vessel morphology and a decrease in microvessel density and mean vessel diameter in the combinational treatment. Furthermore, the combination therapy showed a remarkable reduction in tumor hypoxia, downregulated RGS5 expression, and increased mature pericyte coverage. Our data suggest that the combination of IFN-α and DTIC therapy more efficiently inhibits tumor growth by normalizing tumor vasculature. This study shows a previously unrecognized role of IFN-α in melanoma vascular normalization and suggests that pericyte including its novel marker RGS5 is an important target of IFN-α.",

One-dimensional (1D) n-type SnO2-p-type PPy composite nanofibers were prepared by combining the electrospinning and polymerization techniques, and taken as models to explore the synergic effect during the sensing measurement. Outstanding sensing performances, such as large responses and low detection limits (20 ppb for ammonia) were obtained. A plausible mechanism for the synergic effect was established by introducing p-n junction theory to the systems. Moreover, interfacial metal (Ag) nanoparticles were introduced into the n-type SnO 2-p-type PPy nano-hybrids to further supplement and verify our theory. The generality of this mechanism was further verified using TiO 2-PPy and TiO2-Au-PPy nano-hybrids. We believe that our results can construct a powerful platform to better understand the relationship between the microstructures and their gas sensing performances. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

TSG101 is one of the cellular proteins involved in the budding process of HIV-1, and plays an important role in the cellular vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) pathway. Its main function being recognizing ubiquitinated cargo, TSG101 also proved to be essential for the budding process of HIV-1 virions. In this process, TSG101 is recruited from internal site of the infected cell to the budding site to aid in the release of the HIV-1 virus particles. Depletion of TSG101 from virus-producing cells can lead to a budding defect. Therefore, TSG101 is a potentially new attractive target for therapeutic intervention in AIDS. This review describes the structure and function of TSG101 and latest progress in the discovery of TSG101-directed HIV-1 inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Astragali Radix (Huangqi), a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal plant, has been used for centuries as a reinforcing vital energy herb in China. In this study, the antifatigue effect of Astragali Radix was investigated by an (1)H NMR based metabolomic approach coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. The results indicated that oral administration of Astragali Radix at a dose of 3 g kg(-1) body weight could significantly prolong the exhaustive swimming time of rats, and alter the serum and urine metabolome. The rats treated by Astragali Radix extracts showed higher levels of glucose, creatine, glycine, citrate, guanidinoacetate, allantoin, dimethylglycine, dimethylamine (DMA), creatinine, betaine and malate and lower levels of lactate, choline species, O-acetylated glycoproteins (OAG), glycerol, β-OH-butyrate, α-ketoglutarate, trimethylamine (TMA) and hippurate. And these metabolic changes indicated that Astragali Radix facilitated recovery from fatigue by regulating the glycometabolism, lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. Chemical analysis showed that various components were present in the Astragali Radix extracts, and the bioactive compounds responsible for the antifatigue activity should be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "Shuxuening injection (SXNI) is made from the extract of Ginkgo biloba, and used for curing coronary heart disease, stenocardia and cerebral vasospasm. However, the flavonoids and terpene trilactones (TTLs) only account for about 30% of the dry weight of SXNI according to the current quality control standard. Thus, systematic investigation of the chemical composition of SXNI is needed to guarantee the drug safety. In this study, the integral approach of ultra high performance liquid chromatography-Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, combining with the solvent partition, were used for identifying the phytochemical compounds in SXNI. The NMR analysis revealed the possible structure types based on the characteristic chemical shifts, coupling constants, and peak shape, which gave the clues for the further UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis of previously unknown or uncatalogued compounds. The characteristic ions and structural network of flavonoids and TTLs were generated and used in the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS based structure identification. Only 72 compounds could be identified by the direct UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis of SXNI, while this systematic strategy led to the identification of 133 compounds, which included 73 flavonoids, 5 biflavone, 6 proanthocyanidin, 14 TTLs, 6 fatty acids, 5 fatty amides, 12 organic acids, 1 amino acid, 3 excipients, 2 saccharides and 6 other components. In addition, the presence of steroids and triglycerides were also suggested by NMR. The absence of toxic components in SXNI was also confirmed. In addition, the NMR spectrum also revealed some unknown signals, which need to be further identified. This approach was proved to be useful for the rapid and effective identification of various compounds in the TCM preparations.",

        "abstract": "To explore the expression and significance of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).A total of 27 MM patients and 8 health controls were enrolled in this study. The expression of miR-15a/16,miR-34a,miR-194-2-192 cluster and miR-181a/b in bone marrow were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of Th17 related cytokines interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-21, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-27 in peripheral blood plasma. The role of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines was analyzed in the development of MM.The expression of miR-15a/16,miR-34a,miR-194-2-192 cluster in MM patients were significantly lower than those of the health controls, while miR-181a/b were exactly the reverse (P<0.05). The levels of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 were up-regulated in MM patients compared to health controls while IL-22 was down-regulated (P<0.05). There was no significant difference of IL-23 between the two groups. The levels of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines had associated with ISS but not with some clinical parameters (such as gender, age, disease classification). Higher expression of IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, IL-27, miR-181a/b and lower expression of miR-15a/16,miR-34a,miR-194 and IL-22 were observed in the end stage than the early stage of MM patients (P<0.05). There was a significant correlation between miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines.Up-regulated IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 may potentially down-regulate the expression of several miRNAs in MM patients. Establishment of the relationship may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of MM and for clinical diagnosis of the disease.",

Here, we investigated anti-tumor effect of alantolactone, an allergenic sesquiterpene lactone, on human multiple myeloma (MM) and showed alantolactone inhibited growth of MM cells, both in the presence or absence of bone marrow (BM)-derived stromal cells (HS-5), and subsequent G1 phase arrest, and apoptosis as demonstrated by increased Annexin-V/7-AAD binding, caspase-3 or caspase-9 activation and down-modulation of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. In addition, alantolactone reduced the secretion of MM survival and growth-related cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor, from MM cells or HS-5 cells, and inhibited cytokine-induced osteoclastogenesis. Notably, alantolactone also inhibited cell proliferation in bortezomib-resistant MM cells. Taken together, alantolactone exerted anti-tumor effect on MM by suppressing cell proliferation, triggering apoptosis, partly damaging the BM microenvironment and overcoming proteasome inhibitor resistance, suggesting alantolactone may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of human MM.",

The modifications are realized by saturating the dangling edge bonds by different terminal groups, such as H, NH2, NO2, and CH3. Such modification has a significant impact on the ZGNR electronic structure. Half-metallicity is observed when ZGNR is terminated by NO2 groups at one edge and by CH3 groups on the other side. Free energy analysis suggests that edge-modification is a practical way in experiment to realize half-metallicity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the differential expression of total EGF, pro-angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis isoforms of VEGF in human carcinoma of bladder cell T24 when treated with 5-azacytidine or betulinic acid respectively. METHODS The mRNA expression of total VEGF, pro-angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis isoforms was detected by RT-PCR after treatment with 5-azacytidine or betulinic acid. RESULTS After treatment with 5-azacytidine, there was an increase in the expression of total VEGF and pro-angiogenesis isoforms of VEGF, while the expression of anti-angiogenesis isoforms was decreased. When treated with betulinic acid, the expression of total VEGF and pro-angiogenesis isoforms was decreased, while the expression of anti-angiogenesis isoforms was increased. Moreover, the mRNA expression of VEGF_(165)b decreased when T24 cells were transfected with pVEGF_(165)b. CONCLUSION A differential expression of total VEGF, pro-angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis isoforms of VEGF was observed in human bladder cancer cell when it was subjected to some specific treatments. When the expression of total VEGF wass up-regulated, the expression of pro-angiogenesis isoforms was increased and that of anti-angiogenesis isoforms was decreased. However, when the expression of total VEGF was down-regulated, the expression of pro-angiogenesis isoforms wass decreased while that of anti-angiogenesis isoforms was increased. Furthermore, VEGF_(165) b had an antagonistic effect on the expression of VEGF_(165).",

Metabolites were identified by NIST data base search and comparison with the authentic standards. The data were introduced into SIMCA-P 11.0 software package for multivariate analysis after pretreatment.Fifty-four metabolites were identified, including 35 polar metabolites and 19 nonpolar compounds. The score plot for PCA showed clear separation of the different development stages of flower buds of T. farfara, showing a trend of gradual change. Samples of October, November, December were in close proximity on the plot, indicating that the metabolome of these three periods was similar, samples from September (early development) and March (after flowering) were far away, showing big chemical differences. Content comparison results of some representative metabolites reveals that, the content of proline, lysine and linoleic acid increased gradually to the highest in the medium term, but sharply decreased to the lowest after flowering; the content of malic acid and citric acid were the lowest in the medium term; sucrose content decreased gradually, and then reached the lowest level after blooming.It is obvious that metabolites of the early development and flowering stage were quite different with those of the traditional harvest time, suggesting that they can not be used as traditional medicine. This study will provide a research basis for harvest time determination and bioactive compounds of T. farfara.",

There are two conserved amino acid residues D14 and R138 in dimeric AK which form inter-subunit hydrogen bond.

Mutations (R138G, R138A and D14G) abolished D14 and R138 interaction disrupted the structure or conformation of S. japonicus AK. These R138G, R138A and D14G mutations changed their native assembles of dimeric AK and caused them in a partially unfolded state. The partially unfolded state of these mutant AKs made them prone to aggregate under environmental stress. The D14E/R138K and R138K mutant AKs showed similar characteristics to those of WT AK for forming the interaction which could replacement roles of D14 and R138 interaction. These results suggested that D14 and R138 interaction is involved in AK's activity, substrate synergism and structural stability.",

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin protein. Despite significant advances in the treatment of MM, challenges such as resistance to therapy remain. Currently, inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is emerging as a potential method for treating cancers. Numerous HDAC inhibitors are being studied for use in monotherapy or in conjunction with other agents for MM. In this study, we investigated the anti-myeloma effect of Nexturastat A (NexA), a novel selective HDAC6 inhibitor. We found that NexA impaired MM cells viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NexA also provoked a cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in MM cells. Furthermore, NexA promoted apoptosis of MM cells via transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter, which may through its ability to upregulate the H3Ac and H4Ac levels. Additionally, NexA could overcome bortezomib (BTZ) resistance in MM cells and NexA in combination with BTZ had stronger efficacy. We also confirmed that NexA inhibited tumor growth in murine xenograft models of MM. These interesting findings provided the rationale for the future advancement of this novel HDAC6 inhibitor as a potential therapeutic anti-myeloma agent.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to construct the targeting AATF shRNA eukaryotic expression vector and establish the stably transfected U937 cell lines. The sequence of AATF mRNA was obtained from GenBank. After excluding homology, three plasmid expression vectors coding shRNA targeting 228 ∼ 249, 303 ∼ 324 and 443 ∼ 464 of AATF gene sequence were synthesized. Two terminals of shRNA carried BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. The selected nucleotides were cloned into the plasmid pSilencer 3.1-H1 neo respectively, and the resultant recombinant plasmids were named as pSA-1, pSA-2, pSA-3. The sequences of the recombinant plasmids were identified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into the cell line U937 by electroporation with Neon(TM) Transfection System. The transfected cells were persistently screened under G418 (500 mg/L), and isolated with a limited dilution for 8 weeks. The inhibition of AATF mRNA and protein expression was respectively detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that RNAi eukaryotic expression vectors targeting AATF had correct reading frame and nucleotide sequence. Real-time PCR revealed that AATF shRNA effectively silenced mRNA expression of AATF. Western blot analysis found that AATF shRNA obviously suppressed protein expression of AATF (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the shRNA eukaryotic expression vector has been successfully constructed which can inhibit the expression of AATF, and the establishment of stably transfected U937 cell lines provide a original route for exploring the mechanism of AATF in human Leukemia further.",

An\nO(N) ground state calculation is carried out to get the density matrix (DM).\nThrough a projection of the DM onto atomic orbitals and a subsequent O(N)\northogonalization, we obtain initial orthogonal localized orbitals. These\norbitals can be maximally localized in linear scaling by simple Jacobi sweeps.\nOur O(N) method is validated by applying it to water molecule and wurtzite ZnO.\nThe linear scaling behavior of the new method is demonstrated by computing the\nMLWFs of boron nitride nanotubes.",

The effect and precise molecular mechanism of fasudil on the biology behavior of lung cancer cell A549 remains unclear. The cytotoxic effect of fasudil on A549 cell was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Wound-healing assay was used to evaluate the effect of fasudil on migration activity of A549 cells. The invasion activity of A549 cells was detected by transwell chamber assay. The expression of MMPs was measured by gelatin zymography. RT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate the molecular change of A549 cells after treated with fasudil. Fasudil-inhibited proliferation of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, decreased the migration and invasion activity. After treated with fasudil, the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly inhibited compared with the control group. Furthermore, the expression of RhoA and VEGF of A549 cell treated with fasudil was significantly down-regulated. Our findings indicate that fasudil might have a therapeutic potential for lung cancer though inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, MMPs activity and down-regulating the expression of RhoA and VEGF.",

        "abstract": "For the ultrahigh-resolution airborne stepped-frequency synthetic aperture radar, very large synthetic bandwidth and very long integration time may lead to a 2-D space-variant (SV) motion error when the aircraft flies off the ideally straight trajectory due to the atmospheric turbulence. This new type of error complicates the motion estimation and motion compensation (MOCO). For the motion estimation, we present a jointly 2-D SV motion error estimation method to simultaneously consider the range-variant motion error and the azimuth-variant motion error. For the MOCO, we propose a 2-D SV-MOCO method. The method is implemented through three processing steps: 1) two-step MOCO for the space-invariant motion error and the range-variant phase error; 2) range block-based chirp-z transform (CZT) for the range-variant envelope error; and 3) range block division for the range-dependent azimuth-variant phase error based on the azimuth subaperture method. Finally, processing of simulated data and real data validates the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "The difficulty in synthesizing boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) in a conventional horizontal tube furnace by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) may be ascribed to the failure to identify suitable catalysts and nucleation particles. This report demonstrates that magnesium diboride (MgB2) can effectively catalyze the growth of BNNTs in such a tube furnace from various boron sources, including boron oxide (B2O3), boric acid (H3BO3), and a mixture of boron (B) and calcium oxide (CaO). This catalyst is more efficient than the possible magnesium oxide (MgO) or magnesium nitride (Mg3N2) catalysts. MgB2 efficiently catalyzes the formation of BNNTs by maintaining a liquid state and showing a dissolving capacity for B2O3 at the growth temperature, thus satisfying the criteria for the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanisms of one-dimensional nanomaterials. First-principles simulations demonstrate that B2O3 can be dissolved into the MgB2 nanoparticle. We believe that the strong catalytic behavior of MgB2 can be attributed to its robust nucleation for BNNTs and dissolubility for B2O3.",

        "abstract": "Graphene oxide (GO) is an important intermediate to prepare graphene and it\nis also a versatile material with various applications. However, despite its\nimportance, the detailed structure of GO is still unclear. For example,\nprevious theoretical studies based on energetics have suggested that hydroxyl\nchain is an important structural motif of GO, which, however, is found to be\ncontrary to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment. In this study, we\ncheck both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects missed previously. First\nprinciples thermodynamics gives a free energy based stability ordering similar\nto that based on energetics, and hydroxyl chain is thus thermodynamically still\nfavorable. At the same time, by checking the calculated vibrational\nfrequencies, we note that hydroxyl chain structure is also inconsistent with\ninfrared experiment. Therefore, kinetics during GO synthesis is expected to\nmake an important role in GO structure. Transition state calculations predict\nlarge energy barriers between local minima, which suggests that experimentally\nobtained GO has a kinetically constrained structure.",

Wolf), Radix Paeoniae Alba (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.), Radix Glycyrrhizae (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), Radix Bupleuri (Bupleurum chinense DC.), Radix Angelicae Sinensis (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.), Herba Menthae (Mentha haplocalyx Briq.), and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens (Zingiber officinale Rosc.), has been widely used in the clinic for treating mental disorders. Behavior and biochemical analyses indicate xiaoyaosan has obvious anti-depression activity. However, there is no report on the effects of xiaoyaosan using a metabolomics approach.A urinary metabolomics method was applied to evaluate the efficacy of xiaoyaosan on rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress.Rats were divided into 6 groups and drugs were administered during the 21-day model building period. Urine was measured using GC-MS, processed with XCMS and Microsoft Excel and analyzed by SIMCA-P and SPASS software. Variable importance in projection statistics and loading plot were used to find biomarker ions.Clear separation between model and each drug group was achieved. High dose group of xiaoyaosan was much closer to control group than middle dose group and amitriptyline group. The time-dependent recovery tendency in high dose group was obtained.In term of anti-depression effect, high dose xiaoyaosan was the most effective and amitriptyline equaled middle dose xiaoyaosan as shown by metabolomics strategy and behavior tests. Some common and characteristic metabolites on the anti-depression of xiaoyaosan and amitriptyline were obtained. The work showed metabolomics is a valuable tool in studying the efficacy and potential biomarkers of therapeutic effect of complex prescriptions.",

Venationary feature correlation with old families and taxonomic discussion show that, among them, one specimen can be assigned to a new family-Sunopteridae fam. nov., which includes a new genus and species and can be referred to Order Protorthoptera Handlirsch, 1906 in taxonomic position, thus be-longing to a new member of the Tongchuan Entomoassemblage of Shaanxi Entomofauna (belonging to Shaanxi Biota). The discovery of the new family and its new genus and species has certain reference values as follows: (1) The discovery of the new family and its new genus and species fills firstly the vacancy in the protorthopterous field of China; (2) In the meantime, it fills also the gaps of the valuable Middle Triassic protorthopterous fossil specimens between Late Carboniferous and Late Triassic Epochs in the world; (3) Judging from venationary features and taxonomic position, especially in the course of the formation of the merged vein of M and Cu, it formed a new unique and particular style of merged vein M+Cu. It not only is unique and simple, but also can be distinguished from the above mentioned 10 old families, thus providing important taxonomic evidence.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effect of the lentiviral vector mediated CXCR4 overexpressed mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).Lentiviral vector containing CXCR4 was constructed. CXCR4 overexpressed MSC by lentiviral vector mediated were assessed. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched mouse model of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from C57BL/6 donors to BALB/c recipients was constructed. Mice were divided into five groups: total body irradiation (TBI) group, mice received irradiation only; BMT group, mice were transplanted with bone marrow (BM) after TBI; GVHD group, mice were transplanted with BM and splencytes after TBI; CXCR4-MSC group, mice were transplanted with CXCR4-MSC, BM and splencytes after TBI; EGFP-MSC group, mice were transplanted with EGFP-MSC, BM and splencytes after TBI. The survival, body weight and clinical score of GVHD in transplanted mice were monitored. Liver, intestine and skin from mice in each group were obtained for histological examination. Plasma concentrations of inflammation factors such as interleukin (IL)-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α were also determined using a cytometric bead array cytokine kit.All mice in TBI group died within 14 days, while all of BMT group survived. The mean survival times for GVHD, EGFP-MSC and CXCR4-MSC groups were (17.0 ± 2.3) d, (21.7 ± 4.8) d and (30.1 ± 9.1) d, respectively. Treatment with CXCR4 over-expressing MSCs could decrease the mortality rate. All mice in each group developed clinical signs such as hunched posture, dull fur, diarrhea and weight loss. Meanwhile, histopathological findings in target organs were confirmed the presence of GVHD. While, clinical GVHD scores and histopathological scores in CXCR4-MSC group were significantly lower than that of GVHD group. Moreover, compared with control groups, the plasma IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α level in recipients infused with CXCR4-MSC were significantly decreased (P<0.05).The results revealed that CXCR4- transduced MSCs could effectively control the occurrence of mouse GVHD following allogeneic BM transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the clinical significance of plasma cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in patients with chronic cor pulmonale. Methods The levels of plasma COX-2 in 65 patients with chronic cor pulmonale and 30 normal control subjects were measured by ELISA. Results The levels of plasma COX-2 in patients during acute phase (45.23±4.16) IU/L and recovery phase (21.40±5.19) IU/L were significantly higher than the normal subjects (7.13 ± 3.26) (P<0.01). During acute phase, the degree of cardiac failure is correlated with a high level of plasma COX-2. The level of COX-2 in patients with grade Ⅳ, Ⅲ and Ⅱ cardiac failure was (62.98 ± 8.15),(39.0±6.73), and (12.84 ± 5.2) IU/L, respectively. The value is significantly different from the normal control subjects (P<0.01). Furthermore, the levels of plasma COX-2 in the patients during acute phase showed a significant negative correlation with PaO2(5.08±2.65) kPa( r=-0.65,P<0.01) and pH (7.29±0.31) (r=-0.61,P<0.01). The levels of plasma COX-2, however, was positively correlated with PaCO2 (7.92±2.69) kPa (r=0.71,P<0.01). Conclusion COX-2 may play an important role in the inflammatory process in patients with chronic cor pulmonale. Monitoring the levels of plasma COX-2 may be useful in the disease management.",

The polypurine tract (PPT) element, ubiquinone promoter (PUB) and GFP were ligated to plasmid pLO134 using subcloning technology to construct plasmid pTK153. Human kidney 293T cells were co-transfected with the three-plasmid system containing packaging plasmid DeltaNRF, plasmid pTK153 and envelope plasmid VSV-G by using calcium phosphate DNA precipation and the expression of GFP was observed under fluorescence microscope after 12 hours. The viral particles were collected after transfection 72 hours, were frozen at -80 degrees C and were used to infect mouse T lymphocytes at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 3. The expression of GFP in mouse T lymphocytes was observed by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The results showed that the transfection efficacy was 63.04 +/- 7.24% in 293T cells analysed by FACS and the viral titer was (3.09 +/- 0.61) x 10(6) U/ml. The expression of GFP was also evident in mouse T lymphocytes and the transduction efficacy was (37.98 +/- 6.26)%.

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165)-mediated autocrine stimulation of tumor cells enhances the progression to a malignant phenotype. VEGF165b competes with VEGF165 and binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), resulting in inhibition of downstream signal transduction pathways. This study was designed to investigate the role of VEGF165b in the migration and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The full-length of VEGF165b was constructed and cloned into an expression plasmid (pVEGF165b), and then transfected into A549 cells. Dimethylthiazolyl- 1 -2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect the effect of VEGF165b on proliferation of transfected cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to examine the effect of VEGF165b on the expression of VEGF165 in transfected cells. Wound-healing assays were used to investigate the effect of VEGF165b on migration of transfected cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) activity assay and in vitro invasion assay were used to determine the role of VEGF165b in invasion of transfected cells. There was no significant change in proliferation of A549 cells after transfection of pVEGF165b, but the expression of VEGF165, migration and invasion in A549 cells were inhibited. Furthermore, exogenous VEGF165b inhibited the activity of MMP9 in the supernatant of A549 cells and the subsequent invasion capacity of those cells. We therefore conclude that exogenous VEGF165b can inhibit the expression of VEGF165, as well as the migration and invasion of A549 cells, but has no effect on the proliferation of A549 cells. © 2011 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract": "Black phosphorus has attracted significant attention as a new emerging 2D material in recent years. Due to its novel and unique properties, new 2D phosphorus nanostructures have also been predicted by theoretical calculations. However, experimental realization of new phosphorus structures has been rarely reported and remains one major challenge. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate phosphorus growth behaviors on different substrates to unravel the growth mechanism and provides useful guidelines for the selection of suitable substrates to synthesis the desired structure. This study reports a molecular-beam-epitaxial growth of phosphorus on Cu(110) by using bulk black phosphorous crystals as precursor, through the combination of in situ low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Atomically resolved STM image and the corresponding DFT simulations reveal the formation of phosphorus monomers and dimmers locating in the valley of the Cu(110) surface. XPS and Bader charge analysis confirm a significant electron transfer from the Cu(110) substrate to P atoms on top.",

This simple strategy could be expected to extend for the fabrication of similar metal-oxide loaded nanofibers using different precursors. The morphological and structural characteristics of the resultant product were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). To demonstrate the usage of such Pd 0-loaded SnO2 nanomaterial, a chemical gas sensor has been fabricated and investigated for H2 detection. The sensing performances versus Pd0-loaded levels have been investigated in detail. An ultralow limit of detection (20 ppb), high response, fast response and recovery, and selectivity have been obtained on the basis of the sensors operating at room temperature. The combination of SnO2 crystal structure and catalytic activity of Pd0-loaded gives a very attractive sensing behavior for applications as real-time monitoring gas sensors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Statins have been confirmed with protective effect to microvessels in diabetic retinopathy, implicated as reducing vascular permeability, maintaining endothelial junction integrity and improving blood perfusion, which are surrogate markers of vascular 'normalization', but no data are currently available on efficacy of statins on tumor endothelial functions. Since statins have been shown to exhibit a biphasic dose-related response on biological behaviour of microvessels, we sought to determine whether statins with bipolar concentrations can ameliorate vessel dysfunction and then increase efficiency of chemotherapeutics in Lewis lung carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma models. Our in vitro study showed that simvastatin reduces hypoxia-induced endothelium leakage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a concentration-dependent manner. In tumor-bearing mice, low-dose simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) induced upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) skewed vessels to a pericyte-coated and stable pattern, while high-dose simvastatin (10 mg/kg) remarkably deceased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, attenuating VEGF-drived tumor vessel hyperpermeability. These changes ultimately improved intratumoral perfusion and decreased tumor hypoxia. Administration of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide to the simvastatin-treated mice resulted in slower tumor growth. Collectively, simvastatin may promote tumor vessel normalization and show clinical benefit when used in combination with chemotherapeutics.",

However, all those 1D semiconducting nanostructures are sensitive to both volatile organic compounds (VOFs) and relative humidity (RH), causing the instability of those devices operated in air (except in biological/chemical sensors). Herein, we demonstrated an effective route to not only stabilize 1D semiconducting nanostructures in air but also maintain their electrical properties by constructing 1D isomeric semiconducting nanorods on 1D semiconducting nanostructures to form 1D isomeric and hierarchical semiconducting nanostructures. 1D isomeric and hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures (IHTNs) were chosen as a model, both excellent air stability and good electrical properties can be achieved. With such IHTNs as building blocks, a stable field-effect transistor has been realized. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

        "abstract": "The most popular way to produce graphene nowadays is chemical vapor deposition, where, surprisingly, H2 gas is routinely supplied even though it is a byproduct itself. In this study, by identifying dominant growing pathways via multiscale simulations, we unambiguously reveal the central role hydrogen played in graphene growth. Hydrogen can saturate the edges of a growing graphene island to some extent, depending on the H2 pressure. Although graphene etching by hydrogen has been observed in experiment, hydrogen saturation actually stabilizes graphene edges by reducing the detachment rates of carbon-containing species. Such a new picture well explains some puzzling experimental observations and is also instrumental in growth protocol optimization for two-dimensional atomic crystal van der Waals epitaxy.",

Methods:89 cases of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis and normal people were measured of disc height ratio by radiographs,facet joint orientation and transverse articular dimensions by spiral computed tomography scans. All data were statistically treated and analyzed. Results:Angle of facet joint of L3/4,L4/5,and L5/S1 segments in LDS group was (56.37±11.90)°,(61.30±13.41)°and (43.89±11.38)° respectively,transverse dimension of facet joint (14.69±3.34)mm,(19.07±4.95)mm and(9.84±3.02)mm,and disc height ratio 0.29±0.07,0.24±0.06 and 0.25±0.06 respectively. The significantly sagittal orientation of facet joint,decreasing in disc height ratio and increasing in transverse dimension were found in LDS group comparing with control group. All segments were discovered degeneration in LDS group. Conclusions:(1)The more increase of transverse dimension of the facet joint,the more tend of sagital orientation of the facet joint; (2) The lumbar facet joint closely touches with the lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis; (3) Clinic images absent right description for the lumbar facet joint disease,which should be studied in further.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption of oxygen atoms on the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface is investigated by the use of ab initio total energy density functional methods within the generalized gradient approximation. Considering the repulsive interactions between the adsorbed oxygen atoms, a multiple-layer adsorption model (MLAM), in which the adsorbed oxygen atoms take the sites in different adsorption layers, was used. Our calculated results with a p (2 × 2) unit cell show that the surface face-centered cubic (SFCC) sites are the most favorable sites at the oxygen coverage of 0.25 monolayer (ML). However, the system with one oxygen adatom taking the SFCC sites and the other one taking the octahedral sites between second and third Zr layers (Octa(2,3)) is the most stable configuration at the coverage of 0.50 ML. As the oxygen coverage is increased to 1.0 ML, each of the oxygen atoms prefers taking the SFCC and octahedral sites such as Octa(2,3), Octa(4,5) and Octa(6,7) in the alternate layers, respectively. Our calculated results of the work functions with the MLAM successfully explain the interesting and unusual experimental work function changes upon oxygen adsorption. It should be noticed that the MLAM must be taken into account for oxygen adsorption on the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface. Keywords Density functional calculations Adsorption Surface relaxation and reconstruction Zirconium 1 Introduction The understanding of the chemisorption of oxygen on metal surfaces is of considerable fundamental interest and important in a number of technological processes such as oxidation, corrosion and heterogeneous catalysis [1] . It is generally believed that the adsorbed oxygen atoms get electrons from metals and become negative ions when they adsorbed on metal surfaces [2–6] . The interactions between the adsorbed oxygen atoms may be attractive such as on Al(1 1 1) surface [2] , or repulsive such as on transition metal Ru(0 0 0 1) [3] , Rh(1 1 1) [4] , Pd(1 1 1) [5] , Ag(1 1 1) [6] surfaces. A representative chemisorption system is oxygen on Zr(0 0 0 1) surface, which was broadly studied [7–14] . At low temperature, tensor low-energy electron diffraction (TLEED) suggested that an half of oxygen atoms occupy the octahedral sites between the first and the second metal layer and another half take the sites between the second and third layer, when the coverages of oxygen are 0.5 and 1.0 ML [7,8] . The work function decreased about 0.25 eV at the beginning of the oxygen adsorption on the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface, then increased when the O 2 dose was increased and a subsequent plateau was reached when the O 2 dose is high enough. However, when the adsorbed sample was annealed at the temperature about 560 K, the work function decreased by a further 0.3 eV, and a sharp p (2 × 2) LEED pattern was formed [12] . The changes of work function and LEED pattern caused by anneal are still not well understood. Previous first-principles calculations with the local density approximation (LDA) suggested that the most energetic favorable sites for oxygen adsorption on Zr(0 0 0 1) surface are the octahedral sites between the second and the third layer of Zr(0 0 0 1) surface, when the coverage of oxygen is more than 0.5 ML [13,14] . However, the surface face-centered cubic (SFCC) sites are the most favorable sites when the calculations were done with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [14] . Besides the discrepancies of the prediction for the most energetic favorable sites for oxygen adsorption, the experimental results of changes in the work functions could not be successfully explained by the theoretical calculations. In all the previous calculations, initial geometries were restricted with a layer by layer model. In our recent study on the adsorption of oxygen on Ti(0 0 0 1) surface, considering the repulsive interactions between the adsorbed oxygen atoms, we have proposed a multiple-layer adsorption model (MLAM) [15] . In this model, oxygen atoms can distribute in different layers, so they can take sites with less repulsive interactions. The experimental results such as changes in the work functions, LEED patterns, and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were successfully explained with the MLAM [15] . What is the real structure of the oxygen adsorbed on Zr(0 0 0 1) surface? Why are there changes in the work functions and LEED patterns? In this paper, we address these questions by first-principles calculations. We find that the most stable configuration is a multiple-layer adsorption. The changes in work function and LEED pattern can be successfully explained by the penetration of oxygen atoms from the surface face-centered cubic (SFCC) sites to the octahedral sites in the alternate subsurface layers, when the sample was annealed. 2 Computational details and models Using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [16–18] , we performed the density functional theory (DFT) [19,20] calculations within the GGA of the PW91 form [21] for electron exchange and correlation. Here, we employed projector augmented wave (PAW) method [22] , as implemented by Kresse and Joubert [23] . We tested k -point sampling and kinetic energy cutoff convergence for all supercells. As a result of the convergence tests, we use a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV for all calculations. In our calculation, the error of the average binding energy per oxygen atom is less than 0.01 eV. For bulk Zr, a 15 × 15 × 15 Monkhorst–Pack k -point mesh [24] for the primitive cell is used. The calculated lattice constant is a = 3.235 Å and c = 5.153 Å, which agrees very well with experimental result ( a = 3.23 Å and c = 5.15 Å) [25] and previous DFT–GGA result [26] . All the metal surfaces were modeled by a slab of nine metal layers, separated by a vacuum region equivalent to seven bulk metal layers. Oxygen is placed on one side of the slab where the induced dipole moment is taken into account by applying a dipole correction [27,28] . Most calculations for the surfaces were done in p (2 × 2) surface unit cells with 9 × 9 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k -points [24] in the Brillouin zone. Only in the case for the lower coverage of oxygen Θ = 0.25 ML with the MLAM, a larger p (4 × 2) cell with 5 × 9 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k -points was used. In our calculations, the bottom three zirconium layers were fixed at their bulk truncated structure, the other atoms were relaxed until the forces on each of them were less than 0.01 eV/Å. The various oxygen adsorption sites considered in our calculations are shown Fig. 1 . We will use the symbol Octa( i , j ) to denote oxygen atoms at the octahedral sites between the i th and the j th metal layer. Basing on the calculated results in the reference 14 and our calculations, the energies of the systems when oxygen atoms take the tetrahedral sites are relative much higher than those when adatoms take octahedral sites, so we mainly discuss the systems with oxygen atoms taking octahedral sites. There are four metal atoms in each layer in the p (2 × 2) unit cell. Here, we define the coverage Θ of oxygen as the ratio of the number of adsorbed oxygen atoms to the number of Zr atoms in the first top layer. So there are four oxygen adatoms in the p (2 × 2) unit cell, when Θ = 1.0 ML. The stability of various O/Zr(0 0 0 1) systems is analyzed by the calculations of the average binding energy. The average binding energy per oxygen atom is defined as E b = 1 N O atom [ E O / Zr ( 0 0 0 1 ) slab - ( E Zr ( 0 0 0 1 ) slab + N O atom E O atom ) ] , where N O atom is the number of oxygen atoms in the unit cell, E O / Zr ( 0 0 0 1 ) slab , E Zr ( 0 0 0 1 ) slab and E O atom represent the total energies per unit cell of the oxygen adsorbed Zr slab, the clean Zr slab, and a free oxygen atom, respectively. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 The relative stability of oxygen adsorption sites In order to compare with the previous DFT results [13,14] we have calculated the adsorption of oxygen on Zr(0 0 0 1) surface with the single-layer adsorption model (SLAM), in which the oxygen adatoms are restricted in the same adsorption layer. Only a part of the calculated binding energies for the systems with relative lower energies are plotted in Fig. 2 . In the SLAM, the most stable sites for oxygen atoms are the SFCC sites. This result is in agreement with the GGA-based result of Jomard et al. [14] . The binding energies for oxygen atoms to occupy the tetrahedral sites are much higher than those for oxygen atoms to occupy the octahedral sites. For example, the binding energies for oxygen atoms to occupy the tetrahedral site between second and third layer is −7.71 eV, but it is −8.9 eV for oxygen to take Octa(2,3) site, when the oxygen coverage is 0.25 ML. This result is also in agreement with the DFT result of Jomard et al. [14] . An important point should be noticed. The average binding energy per oxygen atom is increased when the coverage of oxygen is increased. This reflects the repulsive interactions between adsorbates with the decrease of O–O distance. Such a behavior has been also found when oxygen adsorbed on transition metals such as Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag [29] . To discuss the possibility of bulk dissolved oxygen, we also calculate the binding energy of one oxygen atom in an octahedral interstitial site in a large (4 × 4 × 2) Zr bulk unit cell with 64 metal atoms, where all the atomic positions are allowed to relax. The calculated binding energy of bulk dissolved oxygen is −8.77 eV. It can be clearly seen that the bulk dissolved oxygen is more favorable than the surface adsorption when Θ ⩾ 1.00 ML. From the calculated results with the SLAM, it was found that there are repulsive interactions between two adsorbed oxygen atoms when they take the sites with shorter distances, and the bulk dissolved oxygen is more favorable than the surface adsorption when Θ ⩾ 1.00 ML. This make us to use the MLAM to study the structure of oxygen adsorbed Zr(0 0 0 1) surface. In the MLAM, the oxygen adatoms can be distributed into different layers and take the sites with distance as long as possible. Several possible adsorption structures with the MLAM are studied. In each structure, O atoms can occupy several types of sites. For example, SFCC + Octa(1,2) means O atoms can occupy SFCC and Octa(1,2) sites. For each structure, the most stable configuration is found. The average binding energies for them are listed in Table 1 . In order to see clearly, some typical results are plotted in Fig. 3 . Several points should be noted. First, at the lower coverage of oxygen, the SFCC sites are the most stable position for oxygen atoms to take, however, they are not the most stable sites for oxygen atoms to occupy, when the coverage Θ ⩾ 0.50 ML. So the oxygen atoms will penetrate into the subsurface when the oxygen coverage is equal to or higher than 0.50 ML and the temperature is high enough. Second, it is impossible for oxygen atoms to take the combination sites of the SHCP with octahedral sites, because the energies of the systems with oxygen atoms taking combination sites of the SHCP with octahedral sites are higher than those of the systems with oxygen atoms taking combination sites of the SFCC with octahedral sites. For example, the binding energies are −8.84 eV and −9.02 eV for the systems with SHCP + Octa(2,3) and SFCC + Octa(2,3), respectively. Third, it is impossible for oxygen atoms to take the sites in the adjacent layers such as the combination of SFCC + Octa(1,2) and Octa(1,2) + Octa(2,3). This result does not support the TLEED analysis results [7–9] . From many possible surface structure models, Wang et al. used the TLEED method [30,31] to optimize the reliability factor R P and concluded that an half of the oxygen atoms occupy the octahedral sites between the first and second metal layers, i.e., Octa(1,2), another half take those between the second and third metal layers, i.e., Octa(2,3), when the oxygen coverage is 0.5 [7] , and 1.0 ML [8] an half take the SFCC sites and another half take the tetrahedral sites between the first and second metal layers when the coverage is 2.0 ML [9] . Unfortunately, Wang et al. only considered the sites in adjacent layers such as SFCC + Octa(1,2), Octa(1,2) + Octa(2,3), etc., when they designed the initial possible structures. It can be clearly seen from our calculated results that the most stable system with the same coverage of oxygen is that with oxygen atoms taking the combination sites such as SFCC, Octa(2,3), Octa(2,3) and Octa(4,5), etc. in alternate layers, when the coverage of oxygen is higher than or equal to 0.5 ML. It is expected that the optimized reliability factor R P should be smaller for the structures with each of the adsorbed oxygen atoms taking the SFCC, Octa(2,3) and Octa(4,5) etc. sites. In these cases, only one oxygen atom in each adsorption layer within the p (2 × 2) unit cell. It just correspond to the coverage of 0.25 ML for each adsorption layer, though the total oxygen coverage is 0.5 ML or 1.0 ML, etc. Our definition of oxygen coverage is the ratio of the total number of adsorbed oxygen atoms to the number of Zr atoms in the first top layer. As a result, the oxygen adsorbed Zr(0 0 0 1) surface with Θ ⩾ 0.5 ML should change into p (2 × 2) structure, when it is heated in proper temperature. This is in good agreement with experimental results [7–11] . From our calculated results of the binding energies of oxygen with the MLAM, oxygen atoms show a tendency to incorporate into the zirconium bulk, as the increase of the oxygen coverage. However, the energies of the systems with oxygen atoms taking the SFCC and the octahedral sites within the surface region are still lower than that of the oxygen dissolved bulk. Therefore, in practice, there should be an activation barrier between interlayer ordering within the whole surface region and bulk randomization. 3.2 Interlayer spacings relaxation For each system studied above, we compute the variations of the interlayer distances with respect to the bulk Zr value. There are corrugations of the Zr layers when the octahedral sites are partially occupied. So, the interlayer spacing d ij is calculated using the average values for the z -coordinate of the Zr planes. As did in references 13 and 14, we define a ratio of the change of interlayer spacings Δ ij as follows: Δ ij = ( d ij - d 0 ) / d 0 , where d ij is the distance between the i th and j th Zr planes and d 0 the interlayer distance in bulk Zr. Some typical results are listed in Table 2 . From Table 2 , it can be found that most of the changes occur in the top three layers. Compared to the bulk value, the interlayer spacing between the first and second top layers of the clean surface is contracted, and that between the second and third top layers is expanded, which is consistent with previous theoretical results [13,26] . For the oxygen covered surface, our calculated results with the SLAM show that Δ 12 increases from −6.1% to 4.7% as the coverage of the oxygen is increased from 0.0 to 1.0 ML. The reason may be that the electrons are transferred from zirconium atoms to the oxygen atoms and the electron density between zirconium atoms in the first and second top layer is decreased, and the metallic bonds between the first and second top layer zirconium atoms are thus weakened. In the case of Θ = 1.0 ML, our calculated results with the MLAM show that the interlayer spacings between the layers which sandwich the oxygen layer are expanded, and the Zr atoms near the oxygen atoms are pushed away, as a result, Δ 34 and Δ 56 are decreased. Comparing the calculated results with the MLAM to those with the SLAM, the changes of the relaxations induced by oxygen atoms with the MLAM are much smaller than those with the SLAM. For example, in the case of Θ = 1.0 ML, compared to the clean surface, the maximum of the changes of Δ ij with the MLAM is 3.2% (the change of Δ 45 from −0.2% to 3.0%), while it is 10.8% (the change of Δ 12 from −6.1% to 4.7%) with the SLAM. This may be one of the origin that the combination sites such as SFCC + Octa(2,3) + ⋯⋯ are more favorable than the sites only in the same layer such as SFCC or Octa(2,3), etc. 3.3 Changes in work functions In order to explain experimental results of changes in work functions, we have calculated the work functions for the clean and the oxygen adsorbed Zr(0 0 0 1) surfaces with both SLAM and MLAM. Our calculated work function for the clean surface is 4.24 eV, which agree well with experimental value 4.33 eV [32] , and 4.05 eV [33] , and previous DFT result 4.26 eV [13] . In comparison to the clean Zr(0 0 0 1) surface, the changes in work functions Δ ϕ for the different adsorbed systems are shown in Fig. 4 for the range of oxygen coverage 0 ⩽ Θ ⩽ 1 ML with both SLAM and MLAM. At low temperature (82 K), the work function decreased about 0.25 eV at the beginning of the oxygen adsorption on the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface, then increased when the O 2 dose was increased and a subsequent plateau was reached when the O 2 dose is high enough [12] . It is clearly seen that the changes in the work functions of the most stable systems with the SLAM is in excellent agreement with the low temperature experimental results, where oxygen atoms only occupy the SFCC sites. When the adsorbed sample was annealed at the temperature about 560 K, the work function decreased by a further 0.3 eV, and a sharp p(2 × 2) LEED pattern was formed [12] . Similar results were obtained when the Zr(0 0 0 1) surface was oxidized at room temperature and annealed at temperature of 473 K [11] . Now, using MLAM, we can explain these experimental puzzle. When the oxygen adsorbed sample was annealed at higher temperature, the adatoms on the surface would overcome the barrier and penetrate into the subsurface. Of course, they would occupy the most stable sites. From Fig. 4 , it can be found that the work functions of the most stable systems are almost constant when the oxygen coverage is more than 0.25 ML. Compared to those SLAM systems, the work functions decreased a lot. It should be noted that all the structures of the most stable systems are p (2 × 2), because there is only one oxygen atom in each of adsorbed layers. Another point should be stressed. It is general believed that the work functions increase (decrease) when the negatively charged adatom such as oxygen adsorb above (below) the surface [34] . Intuitively, we expect that the charge is transferred from the metal atoms to the more electronegative oxygen atoms. When the oxygen coverage is higher than 0.50 ML, the general expression is correct. However, the work function of the system with 0.25 ML of oxygen taking the SFCC sites decreases in comparison to the clean surface. The similar behavior has also been found in the O/Ti(0 0 0 1) [15] , and O/Al(1 1 1) [2] systems. As pointed by Leung et al, the work function changes are not only decided by the quantity and the sign of the charge transferred, but also by the details of the charge redistribution [35] . It can not be decided only from the relative changes of the work functions that the oxygen atoms reside on surface or in subsurface. 4 Conclusion In summary, considering the repulsive interactions between the adsorbed oxygen atoms on Zr(0 0 0 1) surface, we need use the MLAM, in which the oxygen adatoms can be distributed into different layers and take the sites with distance as long as possible. The first-principle calculations with this model show that the SFCC sites are the most favorable sites at the coverage of 0.25 ML; however, the system with one oxygen adatom taking the SFCC sites and each of the others taking the octahedral sites in alternate subsurface layers is the most stable configuration when the coverage of oxygen is equal to or higher than 0.5 ML. The experimental results of work function changes after anneal are successfully elucidated with MLAM. We anticipate that the MLAM may also be generally valid for other gas atom adsorption on some other metal surfaces, and it should be considered in future theoretical modeling.

        "abstract": "Constitutive NF-κB activation is required for survival of activated B cell-like subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). However, current NF-κB targeting strategies lack cancer cell specificity. Here, we identified a novel inhibitor, piperlongumine, features direct binding to NF-κB p65 subunit and suppression of p65 nuclear import. This was accompanied by NF-κB reporter activity suppression and NF-κB target gene downregulation. Moreover, mutation of Cys(38) to Ser in p65 abolished this effect of piperlongumine on inhibition of p65 nuclear import. Furthermore, we show that piperlongumine selectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of ABC-DLBCL cells. Most notably, it has been reported that piperlongumine did not affect normal cells even at high doses and was nontoxic to animals. Hence, our current study provides new insight into piperlongumine's mechanism of action and novel approach to ABC-DLBCL target therapy.",

Our results indicate the superconducting transition in gallium-doped germanium can be explained within a standard phonon mediated mechanism. The contribution of acoustic modes to the coupling constant Λ almost entirely comes from Ga related modes, and ∼25% to Λ. The calculated coupling constant is 0.35 and the corresponding transition temperature is 0.44K for the gallium-doped germanium with 6.25% gallium content using Coulomb pseudopotential μ* = 0.1, in agreement well with the experimental data. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.",

We find that the energy gap of graphene is tunable from 0 to 0.55 eV and sensitive to the stacking order and interlayer distances of the G/BN bilayer. By electronic structure analysis and tight-binding simulations, we conclude that the charge redistribution within graphene and charge transfer between graphene and BN layers determine the energy gap of graphene, through modification of the on-site energy difference of carbon p orbitals at two sublattices. On the basis of the revealed mechanism, we also predict how to engineer the band gap of graphene. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is now considered as a compound and dysregulated immune response. Both Th1 and Th17 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute GVHD. Disbalance of Th1 and Th17 may also play a critical role in mediating acute GVHD. In this study, we investigated the Th1/Th17 imbalance in peripheral blood through out the pathological process of acute GVHD, using a GVHD model of C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) donor to BALB/c (H-2(d)) recipient. We also analyzed the correlation between Th1/Th17 ratio and severity of acute GVHD, and explored the potential function of Th1/Th17 imbalance in acute GVHD. Recipients received 5×10(6) spleen cells (SP) underwent more severe acute GVHD, compared with the ones received 5×10(5) SP. Severe GVHD bearing recipients had much higher proportion of Th1 cells but lower proportion of Th17 cells, compared with mild GVHD bearing ones. The Th1/Th17 ratios in both groups underwent relative changes according to the changing proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells and showed positive correlation with clinical scores of acute GVHD. We describe the changing proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells in acute GVHD, and we find that Th1/Th17 ratio is an accurate indicator for predicting the severity of acute GVHD.",

        "abstract": "An atomic-scale understanding of gas adsorption mechanisms on metal-porphyrins or metal-phthalocyanines is essential for their practical application in biological processes, gas sensing and catalysis. Intensive research efforts have been devoted to the study of coordinative bonding with relatively active small molecules, such as CO, NO, NH3, O2 and H2. However, the binding of single nitrogen atoms has never been addressed, which is both of fundamental interest and indeed essential for revealing the elementary chemical binding mechanism in nitrogen reduction processes. Here, we present a simple model system to investigate, at the single-molecule level, the binding of activated nitrogen species on the single Mn atom contained within the manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) molecule supported on an inert graphite surface. Through the combination of in situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the active site and the binding configuration between the activated nitrogen species (neutral nitrogen atom) and the Mn center of MnPc is investigated at the atomic scale.",

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were co-transfected by the three-plasmid system of lentiviral vector including the packaging plasmid NRF, the vector plasmid and the envelope plasmid VSV-G by calcium phosphate DNA precipitation, the mouse T lymphocytes stimulated by concanavalin A were infected by the virus supernatant and diversity concentration prodrug GCV/ACV was co-incubated with TK+ T cells or sr39TK+T cells, the killing effects was estimated by Cell Count kit-8(CCK-8).Results:The titres of lentiviral vector were above 106IU/ml after packaging. The efficiency of different internal promoters to drive the expression of the target gene was CMV>PUB>PGK. The determination of IC50 showed that the sensitivity of sr39TK+T cells to GCV and ACV were higher than TK+T cells about 2.5 and 17.4 times respectively. The survival rates of sr39TK+T cells declined significantly when the concentrations of ACV/GCV were between 1～10μmol/L, The T cell survival rates in ACV group declined from (98.4±2.7)% to (49.9±5.9)% and GCV group from (97.9%±2.7)% to (33.7±5.3)%,P<0.05. When the concentrations of ACV/GCV were increased, further decline of T cell survival rates became unobvious. TK+T cells were sensitive to GCV, the survival rate of T cells declined from (97.9±2.7)% to (38.4±5.5)%,(P<0.05) but they were not sensitive to ACV, the survival rate of T cells declined from (98.4±2.7)% to (73.8±7.4)%, (P>0.05).Conclusions:The genetic engineering T cells containing HSV-TK/HSV-sr39TK genes were generated. Different internal promoters had different effects on transfection efficiency and driving the expression of HSV-TK/HSV-sr39TK genes in T cells. HSV-sr39TK+T cells were more sensitive to GCV and ACV than TK+T cells.",

In this study, metabolite profiling and gene expression analysis of liver tissues were performed by nuclear magnetic resonance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to understand the responses of acute liver injury system in rats to CCl4. Acute liver injury was successfully induced by CCl4 as revealed by histopathological results and significant increase in alanine aminotransferase and serum aspartate aminotransferase. We found that CCl4 caused a significant increase in lactate, succinate, citrate, dimethylgycine, choline and taurine. CCl4 also caused a decrease in some of the amino acids such as leucine/isoleucine, glutamine/glutathione and betaine. Gene function analysis revealed that 10 relevant enzyme genes exhibited changes in expressions in the acute liver injury model. In conclusion, the metabolic pathways, including tricarboxylic acid cycle, antioxidant defense systems, fatty acid β-oxidation, glycolysis and choline and mevalonate metabolisms were impaired in CCl4-treated rat livers. These findings provided an overview of the biochemical consequences of CCl4 exposure and comprehensive insights into the metabolic aspects of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. These findings may also provide reference of the mechanisms of acute liver injury that could be used to study the changes in functional genes and metabolites.",

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. MicroRNA (miR)-21 was detected at a high level in MM and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of MM. However, Sprouty2 (spry2), a downstream target of miR-21, has low expression, and its mechanism in MM is unknown. We investigated whether spry2 could exert an antimyeloma effect and further studied the potential pathogenesis and progression of MM. To address the functional consequences of spry2, we assessed the expression levels of spry2 in several myeloma cell lines and detected low expression levels in MM cells. Overexpression of spry2 suppressed growth and colony formation ability and decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Spry2 also decreased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and partially enhanced the sensitivity of MM cells to an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 and 2. Additionally, spry2 inhibited the tumorigenesis and angiogenesis of MM cells in vivo. In summary, we report for the first time that spry2 can inhibit MM cell growth and survival with a concomitant reduction in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), became the major pest of Brassica vegetable production in Guangdong, a province in southeastern China, in the late 1980s and has continued to challenge growers, particularly during the spring and autumn. Control has relied on insecticides and, as has happened in other parts of the world, resistance to these has evolved and subsequent field control failures have occurred. We review and summarize the history of diamondback moth management in Guangdong. We show that the geographic distribution of the pest in China is well described by a simple climate niche model. Our model predicts the seasonal phenology and some of the variation in abundance among years in Guangdong. Discrepancies may reflect migration and insecticide use at a landscape level. The scale of the pest problem experienced varies with management practices. Local production breaks, and strict post harvest hygiene are associated with lower pest pressure on large-scale production units. As more and more insecticides become ineffective the need to implement an insecticide resistance management strategy, as well as basic integrated pest management practices, will become more pressing. The potential use and development of a better forecasting system for diamondback moth that will assist these developments is outlined.",

        "abstract": "To explore the functions of TH17 cell in cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).A model of acute GVHD (aGVHD) was established with a major histocompatibility complex class I/II-disparate allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Bone marrow monocytes and splenic T cells from donor C57/BL6 were enriched. The recipient BABL mice were irradiated ((60)Co source) with 7.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) and injected with 5 × 10(6) marrow monocytes and 5 × 10(5) T cells. The experimental mice were divided into 3 groups: lethal total body irradiation (TBI); allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and recipients of halofuginone (HF). The symptoms of aGVHD were observed daily and detailed histopathologic analyses of recipient skin were performed at Day 6 post-transplantation. And Tri-color flow cytometry (FCM) was performed at Day 6 post-transplantation to measure the levels of interleukin (IL)-17, interferon (IFN)-γ and TH1/TH17.Clinical GVHD symptoms were observed in recipient mice. The administration of HF to lethally irradiated recipients led to very modest GVHD-induced cutaneous changes manifested predominantly by fur loss. However, the experimental animals receiving only allogeneic BMT showed significant fur loss and pathologic skin conditions. Consistent with the clinical evaluations, the histopathologic results demonstrated significantly increased pathologic cutaneous lesions in recipients undergoing only BMT. The median ratios of TH1/TH17 cells were 17.57 and 5.31 in the HF and BMT groups respectively. The difference had statistical significance (P < 0.05). The serum levels of IL-17 were(1.47 ± 0.18) and (2.81 ± 0.19) pg/ml in the TBI and BMT groups respectively (P < 0.05). But IL-17 could not be detected in the HF group. The serum levels of IFN-γ were (3.86 ± 0.32), (42.97 ± 0.42) and (9.89 ± 0.51) pg/ml in the TBI, BMT and HF groups respectively. The inter-group differences had statistical significance (P < 0.05).An absence of TH17 cell may alleviate the cutaneous GVHD but exacerbate the systemic GVHD.",

Nearly all of the tested compounds inhibited HIV-1 strain IIIB replication in the lower micromolar concentration range (EC50: 0.046-5.46 μM). Notably, the most promising compound 8k exhibited extremely potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 replication with an EC50 value of 0.046 μM, CC50 of 99.9 μM and the viral selectivity index amounted to 2149. These values were much better than those of NVP (EC50 = 0.09 μM) and DDC (EC50 = 1.04 μM). Compound 8k also exhibited moderate inhibition of enzymatic activity with an IC50 value of 4.06 μM, which was of the same order of magnitude as that of NVP (2.74 μM). Docking calculations were also performed to investigate the binding mode of compound 8k into the non-nucleoside binding site of HIV-1 RT and to rationalize some SARs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the radioprotective effects of bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1 in a murine model of pulmonary damage. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in a rat model after 20 Gy radiation of the right thorax. And histological evaluation and protein expressions of irradiated tissue were analyzed to confirm the potential anti-fibrosis effect of JQ1 and its underlying mechanisms. Moreover, colony formation assays were used to explore the effects of JQ1 on esophageal cancer Eca109 and breast cancer MCF7. JQ1 attenuated radiologic and histologic presentations of radiation-induced fibrosis, inflammatory reaction and pulmonary structural changes and the increase of Hounsfield units (HU) density and hydroxyproline content after radiation. Additionally, JQ1 suppressed BRD4, c-MYC, Collagen I, TGF-β, p-NF-κB p65, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 expressions after irradiation, repressed proliferation and transdifferentiation of lung fibroblasts, and impaired clonogenic survival of thoracic cancer cells. Collectively, our study demonstrated for the first time that BET Bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 protected normal lung tissue after radiation, and exerted a radiosensitizing effect in thoracic cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "A large number of studies have suggested that cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) also plays an important role in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the mechanism of CTLA-4 in regulating acute GVHD is still unknown. In the present study, we indicated that compared to healthy controls, CTLA-4 plasma and relative mRNA levels in patients with acute GVHD were decreased and then markedly elevated post 28 days' treatment. CTLA-4 levels in patients with I - II grade acute GVHD were higher than those with III - IV grade acute GVHD either before or after treatment. Upregulation of CTLA-4 significantly increased the luciferase activity and phosphorylation degree of STAT3. Meanwhile, T cell activation was remarkably inhibited and the levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22 were declined. Thus CTLA-4 might be involved in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD and it might down-regulate T helper 1 cells by increasing STAT3 expression in acute GVHD.",

Recent experimental success in the fabrication of single layer blue phosphorus provides a model system to probe the oxidation mechanism of 2D phosphorene down to single layer thicknesses. Here, we report an atomic-scale investigation of the interaction between molecular oxygen and blue phosphorus. The atomic structure of blue phosphorus and the local binding sites of oxygen have been precisely identified using qPlus-based noncontact atomic force microscopy. A combination of low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal a thermally reversible oxidation process of blue phosphorus in a pure oxygen atmosphere. Our study clearly demonstrates the essential role of oxygen in the initial oxidation process, and sheds further light on the fundamental pathways of the degradation mechanism.",

NH3, NO and NO2 molecules chemically adsorb on silicene via strong chemical bonds. With distinct charge transfer from silicene to molecules, silicene and chemisorbed molecules form charge-transfer complexes. The adsorption energy and charge transfer in NO2-adsorbed silicene are larger than those of NH3- and NO-adsorbed silicones. Depending on the adsorbate types and concentrations, the silicene-based charge-transfer complexes exhibit versatile electronic properties with tunable band gap opening at the Dirac point of silicene. The calculated charge carrier concentrations of NO2-chemisorbed silicene are 3 orders of magnitude larger than intrinsic charge carrier concentration of graphene at room temperature. The results present a great potential of silicene for application as a highly sensitive molecule sensor.",

Different adsorption behaviors are predicted for these two surfaces. On the (0001)-Zn surface, O atoms adsorb on hollow sites at the initial stage. Then Zn atoms come in, and the stable structure becomes bulk-like for some specific clusters. On the (0001̄)-O surface, Zn cluster adsorption leads to stable cage structures formed by pulling substrate O out. In clusters with both Zn and O, O atoms avoid directly bonding with the surface, and no energetically favorable bulk-like structure is found. On the basis of the prediction of these surface adsorption behaviors, experimentally observed growth rate and surface roughness differences on these two polar surfaces can be understood. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.",

Among them, the most potent HIV-1 inhibitors were compounds 6c1,6c6, and 6b1 (EC(50)=0.24 ± 0.05, 0.38 ± 0.13, 0.39 ± 0.05 μM, respectively), which possess improved or similar HIV-1 inhibitory activity compared with nevirapine (NVP) (EC(50)=0.21 μM) and delavirdine (DLV) (EC(50)=0.32 μM). None of these compounds were active against HIV-2 replication. Furthermore, enzyme inhibitory assays were performed with selected derivatives against HIV-1 wtRT, confirming that the main target of these compounds is the HIV-1 RT and these new S-DABOs are acting as NNRTIs. The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these new congeners is discussed briefly and rationalized by docking studies.",

Such conclusion can be drawn that the needle volatiles contain most terpenes,the relative content of (4)10-thujene,limonene,β-phellandrene,caryophyllene and p-mentha-1,4(8)-diene peaked at 48 hrs after spraying,and the relative content of β-pinene was always higher than that of the control except at 72 hrs after spraying,and that the amount of ingested food,excreted faeces,the changes of digestibility ratio,transforming ratio,utilization ratio varied among different concentrations,and all of the indices declined with the increase of methyl jasmonate concentration. The mortality showed a contrary trend. The results of this experiment show that exogenous methyl jasmonate can induce insect resistance of plants.",

        "abstract": "Motion errors are inevitably introduced when data is acquired and considerably degrade the image quality in terms of geometric resolution, radiometric accuracy and image contrast, especially in high-resolution spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this study, the authors present a novel two-dimensional (2D) autofocus algorithm directly inserted into polar format algorithm, which compensates the envelop error and the phase error sequentially. A coarse error correction is first performed by global positioning system or inertial navigation system in the range-compressed domain, then a new envelop compensation strategy, stage-by-stage approach, is designed, obtaining promising results for removing range cell migration after 2D interpolation. Additionally, a weighed contrast enhancement autofocus algorithm based on spatially variant model is developed to compensate for the residual phase error, which remarkably improves the estimation accuracy. The presented algorithm is very robust to deal with substantial errors over a variety of scenes even in conditions of homogenous areas with no prominent point scatterers and enables the utilisation of fast Fourier transform. The experimental results obtained by the proposed algorithm confirm that the analysis extends well to realistic situations.",

        "abstract": "This study was purposed to explore the cellular source of IL-22 in graft versus host disease (GVHD) mouse following allo-genetic bone marrow transplantation. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were used as recipients and donors, respectively. GVHD model was established by irradiated BABL/c mice inoculated with mixed suspension of C57BL/6 bone marrow cells and splenic lymphocytes. The mice were divided into normal group (normal), total body irradiated group (TBI), bone marrow cell-transplanted group (BMT), and the combination of bone marrow cell and splenic lymphocytes-induced GVHD group (BS). The level of IL-22 in plasma was detected by ELISA. The cellular source of IL-22 and IL-22(+) subsets were detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that compared with normal mice, the level of IL-22 in plasma from BS mice was the highest (P < 0.01). All the lymphocytes of spleen, lymph nodes and peripheral blood from BS mice could produce IL-22, in which the percentage of IL-22(+)CD4(+) T cell was higher than that of IL-22(+)CD8(+) T cells. Not only Th22 cells but also Th1 and Th17 cells were the cellular source of IL-22 in GVHD mice. It is concluded that the high level of IL-22 has been found in mice with GVHD, which mainly originates from IFN-γ(-)IL-17(-)IL-22(+) Th22 cells.",

Addition of trifluoroacetic acid into the mobile phase resulted in fingerprint chromatograms with stable baselines. There were thirty-two characteristic peaks in the standard fingerprint of B. chinense DC. Different recognition pattern methods, including similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to analyze the 36 samples based on the contents of chemical constituents. Consistent results from SA, HCA and PCA analysis illustrated the rationalisation for why B. smithii Wolff. was not quoted in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and classified samples were in agreement with their species. PLS-DA loading plots showed the chemical markers which had the most influences on the separation among different species. However, SA, HCA and PCA could not differentiate between wild and cultivated B. chinense DC. as well as between samples from different provinces. HPLC fingerprint in combination with chemometric techniques provided a very flexible and reliable method for homogeneity evaluation and quality assessment of traditional Chinese medicine.",

The acquired JAK2 R683G(S) somatic mutations are detected in 15% of patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and are presumed to be a biomarker for B-ALL. However, how JAK2 R683G(S) mutations lead to B-ALL is still unclear. Our results indicated that the E627 and R683 interaction played a vital role in JAK2 autoinhibition. Mutations (R683S, R683G and E627A) disrupting this interaction led to JAK2 constitutive activation, while mutations (R683K, E627D) restoring this interaction decreased its activity. Furthermore, spectroscopy experiments implied that disruption of the E627 and R683 interaction abolished JH1/JH2 domain interactions and forced the JH1 domain into the open, active conformation. Mutations abolishing this interaction promoted the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. The results herein may provide clues to understanding the mechanism of JAK2 R683G(S) mutation-associated B-ALL.",

        "abstract": "Highly efficient solar energy utilization is very desirable in photocatalytic water splitting. However, until now, the infrared part of the solar spectrum, which constitutes almost half of the solar energy, has not been used, resulting in significant loss in the efficiency of solar energy utilization. Here, we propose a new mechanism for water splitting in which near-infrared light can be used to produce hydrogen. This ability is a result of the unique electronic structure of the photocatalyst, in which the valence band and conduction band are distributed on two opposite surfaces with a large electrostatic potential difference produced by the intrinsic dipole of the photocatalyst. This surface potential difference, acting as an auxiliary booster for photoexcited electrons, can effectively reduce the photocatalyst's band gap required for water splitting in the infrared region. Our electronic structure and optical property calculations on a surface-functionalized hexagonal boron-nitride bilayer confirm the existence of such photocatalysts and verify the reaction mechanism.",

Here, we propose a new concept of bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMS) in which completely spin-polarized currents with reversible spin polarization can be created and controlled simply by applying a gate voltage. This is a result of the unique electronic structure of BMS, where the valence and conduction bands possess opposite spin polarization when approaching the Fermi level. BMS is thus expected to have potential for various applications.

        "title": "High expression of CPNE3 predicts adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.",
        "abstract": "CPNE3, a member of a Ca(2+) -dependent phospholipid-binding protein family, was identified as a ligand of ERBB2 and has a more general role in carcinogenesis. Here, we identified the prognostic significance of CPNE3 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients based on two datasets. In the first microarray datasets (n=272), high CPNE3 expression (CPNE3(high) ) was associated with adverse overall survival (OS, P < 0.001) and event-free survival (EFS, P < 0.001) comparing to low CPNE3 expression (CPNE3(low) ). In the second independent group of AML patients (TCGA dataset, n=179), CPNE3(high) was also associated with adverse OS and EFS (OS, P = 0.01; EFS, P = 0.036). Notably, among CPNE3(high) patients, those received allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) had longer OS and EFS than those with chemotherapy alone (allogeneic HCT,n=40 vs. chemotherapy,n=46), but treatment modules play insignificant role in the survival of CPNE3(low) patients (allogeneic HCT,n=32 vs. chemotherapy,n=54). These results indicated that CPNE3(high) is an independent, adverse prognostic factor in AML and could guide treatment decisions towards allogeneic HCT. To understand its inherent mechanisms, we investigated genome-wide gene/microRNAs expression signatures and cell signalling pathways associated with CPNE3 expression. In conclusion, CPNE3(high) is an adverse prognostic biomarker for AML. Its effect may be attributed to the distinctive genome-wide gene/microRNA expression and related cell signaling pathways.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the biologic role of the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil in the vasculogenic mimicry (VM) of B16 mouse melanoma cells. It was previously reported that RhoA plays a critical role in angiogenesis by coordinating endothelial cell cytoskeleton remodeling and promoting endothelial cell motility. Although RhoA has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis, little has been described regarding its control of these tumor cell-lined channels. In this study, we established an in vitro model of VM using 3-dimensional cell culturing of mouse B16 melanoma cells and studied VM in vivo by transplanting B16 cells into C57/BL mice. Next, we explored the effect of RhoA and Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) on VM formation using the Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil. We provide direct evidence that fasudil leads to reduced vascular-like channels in Matrigel. Additional experiments suggested that fasudil prevents both initial cellular architecture changes and cell migration in vitro. Finally, we provide in-depth evidence for the underlying mechanisms of fasudil-induced VM destruction using the Rho-GTPase agonist lysophosphatidic acid. In vivo studies revealed that fasudil reduced B16 melanoma cell xenograft tumor growth without causing significant toxicity in mice. Fasudil-treated tumors also displayed fewer VM channels. These results suggest that fasudil may be an emerging therapeutic option for targeting cancer VM. Mol Cancer Ther; 14(7); 1582-90. ©2015 AACR.",

Amino acid residues in the guanidine specificity (GS) region play important roles in the guanidine-recognition.

In this study, a series of G66 mutations were constructed to investigate its roles in AK's structural stability and activity. Our studies revealed that mutations in this conserved site could cause pronounced loss of activity, conformational changes and structural stability. Spectroscopic experiments indicate that G66 mutations influences AK transition from the molten globule intermediate to the native state in folding process. These results provided herein may suggest that amino acid residue G66 may play a relatively important role in AK's activity and structural stability.",

        "abstract": "The abnormal activation of the downstream signaling pathways of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that are independent of EGFR, contribute to the acquisition of EGFR‑tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The serine/threonine protein kinase casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylates and modulates several members of the EGFR downstream signaling pathways. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of the addition of quinalizarin (a specific CK2 inhibitor) to icotinib (an EGFR‑TKI) on the proliferation and apoptosis of four NSCLC cell lines and its underlying mechanisms. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines HCC827, A549, H1650 and H1975 were employed to represent the EGFR‑TKI‑sensitive EGFR (EGFR‑sensitive) mutation, wild‑type EGFR and the EGFR‑TKI‑resistant EGFR (EGFR‑resistant) mutations. The cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using the Annexin V‑enhanced green fluorescent protein Apoptosis Detection kit. The level of proteins in the EGFR downstream pathway was observed using a western blot assay. The results showed that the cells with the EGFR‑sensitive mutation (HCC827, EGFR E716‑A750del) were more sensitive to icotinib compared with those possessing the EGFR wild‑type (A549) and the EGFR‑resistant mutations (H1650, EGFR E716‑A750del and PTEN lost; H1975, EGFR L858R+T790M). Quinalizarin inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in the cells with the EGFR wild‑type and resistant mutations, and the addition of quinalizarin to icotinib partially restored their sensitivity to icotinib. Quinalizarin and/or icotinib increased the apoptotic rates in the EGFR‑TKI resistant cells, and the combination of these reduced the level of protein downstream of EGFR, including phosphorylated (p‑AKT) and p‑(ERK). In conclusion, quinalizarin may partially sensitize cells to icotinib by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis mediated by AKT and ERK in EGFR‑TKI resistant NSCLC cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown promising results for relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The immune response induced by murine single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of the CAR may limit CAR-T cell persistence and thus increases the risk of leukemia relapse. In this study, we developed a novel humanized scFv from the murine FMC63 antibody. A total of 18 R/R ALL patients with or without prior murine CD19 CAR-T therapy were treated with humanized CD19-targeted CAR-T cells (hCART19s). After lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, the patients received a single dose (1 × 10 /kg) of autologous hCART19s infusion. Among the 14 patients without previous CAR-T therapy, 13 (92.9%) achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) on day 30, whereas 1 of the 3 patients who failed a second murine CAR-T infusion achieved CR after hCART19s infusion. At day 180, the overall and leukemia-free survival rates were 65.8% and 71.4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 22.6%, and the non-relapse mortality rate was 7.1%. During treatment, 13 patients developed grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 4 patients developed grade 3-5 CRS, and 1 patient experienced reversible neurotoxicity. These results indicated that hCART19s could induce remission in patients with R/R B-ALL, especially in patients who received a reinfusion of murine CAR-T. This article is protected by copyright.

In\ncontrast with conventional wisdom, we find that, under typical experimental\nconditions, atomic carbon is thermodynamically unstable on Cu surface. The\nactive species for graphene growth should thus be CHx species instead of carbon\natoms.

Due to its important physiological functions, the acquired CK somatic mutations are closely correlated to diseases. In this study, the E79G point mutation was identified in two acute myocardial infarction patients with muscle CK activity deficiency. The crystal structure of CK indicates that the E79 and K138 interaction plays key roles in sustaining the recognition between N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Mutations of these residues caused pronounced loss of activity, conformational changes and distinct substrate synergism alteration. Moreover, spectroscopic spectra experiments suggested that mutations disrupting this hydrogen bond impaired the secondary and tertiary structure of CK. Meanwhile, protein folding experiments implied that mutations lead them to the partially unfolded state which made them easier to be inactivated and unfolded under environmental stresses. Furthermore, this partially unfolded state upon environmental stresses might gradually decrease the CK level in the patients. Thus, these results might provide clues in the mechanism of CK deficiency diseases.",

Using first-principles approaches, here we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties along two inequivalent zigzag M and X edges of MX$_{2}$ (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se). Along the M edges, we reveal a previously unrecognized but energetically strongly preferred (2x1) reconstruction pattern, which is universally operative for all the MX$_{2}$, characterized by a self-passivation mechanism through place exchanges of the outmost X and M edge atoms. In contrast, the X edges undergo a more moderate (2x1) or (3x1) reconstruction for MoX$_{2}$ or WX$_{2}$, respectively.

        "abstract": "In order to construct a lentiviral vector carrying human VE-cadherin gene, and to express VE-cadherin in Sup-B15 cells, the VE-cadherin gene was amplified by RT-PCR from the human placenta, and then cloned into pCR-Blunt vector. The VE-cadherin DNA fragment was subcloned into pLB vector to generate a lentiviral vector pLB-VEC. Recombinant lentivirus was generated by co-transfection of three-plasmids into 293FT packing cells using lipofectamine 2000. The Sup-B15 cells were transfected by the lentivirus. The post-transfected Sup-B15 cells were observed by microscopy and flow cytometry. Western blot was used to determine the expression of VE-cadherin. The results showed that the VE-cadherin DNA fragment was amplified from human placenta and was cloned into pCR-Blunt vector, the recombinant lentiviral vector pLB-VEC was successfully constructed. High titer lentivirus was prepared by 3-plasmid packing system, and transfected into Sup-B15 cells in vitro effectively. The obviously morphological changes occurred in transfected cells, the expression of VE-cadherin protein could be detected in Sup-B15 cells via flow cytometry and Western blot. It is concluded that the lentiviral vector pLB-VEC carrying human VE-cadherin gene is successfully constructed; VE-cadherin gene is expressed in Sup-B15 cells via lentiviral vector transfection, which provides an optional tool for further study on the mechanism of VE-cadherin controlling leukemia development.",

Herein, we investigated the protective effects of the stromal cell-mediated VE-cadherin-β-catenin signal on Ph+ leukemia cells during imatinib treatment. We found stromal cells could desensitize imatinib and up-regulate VE-cadherin expression on Ph+ leukemia cells (K562 and SUP-B15 cells), which further stabilized and activated β-catenin. Knockdown of VE-cadherin with shRNA diminished the β-catenin protein and partly resensitized Ph+ leukemia cells to imatinib despite the presence of stromal cells, suggesting VE-cadherin is a potential target in the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.",

RA roots with strong sweetness are considered to be of good quality. However, neither a thorough analysis of the component(s) contributing to RA sweetness, nor a scientific investigation of the reliability of this indicator has been conducted to date. In this study, seven kinds of sweetness components were identified in RA and a quality evaluation method based on these components was established and used to characterize the quality of 48 RA samples. The sweetness evaluation method of RA was first built based on the sweetness components, and a comprehensive evaluation index commonly used in quality control of RA was also derived, which was based on the contents of four indicators (astragaloside IV, calycosin glucoside, polysaccharides and extracts). After evaluating the correlation of these indexes the results showed that the level of sweetness exhibited a strong positive correlation with the proposed comprehensive index. Our results indicate that sweetness is one of the most important quality attributes of RA and thus provide a scientific basis for the utility of the sweetness indicator in quality assessment of this Chinese herb.",

In this study, the chemical composition of the two different ARs, which were collected in the Shanxi (wild) and Gansu (cultivated) provinces, were compared by NMR-based metabolic fingerprint coupled with multivariate analysis. The SX-AR- and GS-AR-induced metabolic changes in the endogenous metabolites in mice were also compared.

GO is a critical intermediate for massive production of graphene, and it is also an important material with various application potentials. With many different oxidation species randomly distributed on the basal plane, GO has a complicated nonstoichiometric atomic structure that is still not well understood in spite of intensive studies involving many experimental techniques. Controversies often exist in experimental data interpretation. We report here a first principles study on binding energy of carbon 1s orbital in GO. The calculated results can be well used to interpret experimental x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data and provide a unified spectral assignment. Based on the first principles understanding of XPS, a GO structure model containing new oxidation species epoxy pair and epoxy-hydroxy pair is proposed. Our results demonstrate that first principles computational spectroscopy provides a powerful means to investigate GO structure.",

        "abstract": "Downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling-1 (SOCS1) is one of the vital reasons for JAK1-STAT3 pathway activation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). CUE domain-containing 2 (CUEDC2) was a novel interacting partner of SOCS1 and a positive correlation between the expression of CUEDC2 and SOCS1 was confirmed in primary AML cells and AML cell lines without SOCS1 promoter methylation. We aimed to explore roles of CUEDC2 in regulating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SOCS1 in the leukaemogenesis of AML.According to in vitro experiments, CUEDC2 overexpression increased the level of SOCS1 protein, suppressed JAK1-STAT3 pathway activation. The suppression of this pathway inhibited AML cells' proliferation by causing G1 arrest and enhanced AML cells' sensitivity to cytarabine and idarubicin. Similarity, downregulation of CUEDC2 produced opposite results. Knockout or low expression of CUEDC2 in mouse or AML patients displayed lower overall survival and event-free survival rates, compared with these mouse and AML patients had high-CUEDC2 expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that CUEDC2 overexpression attenuated SOCS1 ubiquitination, facilitated its stabilisation by enhancing SOCS1, Elongin C and Cullin-2 (CUL2) interactions, thus inhibited JAK1-STAT3 pathway and leukaemogenesis of AML. Therefore, our novel findings indicated that CUEDC2 interacted with SOCS1 to suppress SOCS1's ubiquitin-mediated degradation, JAK1-STAT3 pathway activation and leukaemogenesis of AML.",

Among the wide energy gap of the zeolite, near the conduction bands, there are two interstitial electride bands mainly contributed by 6s electrons of Cs atoms, which have a delocalized real space distribution along the channels. For all different doping rates studied, we find that a finite density of states appears at the Fermi level, which predicts a metallic behavior of this material. Detailed electronic structure reveals all the essential properties of the electride model. The shift of Fermi level and the delocalization of the highest occupied bands cause this material to be a powerful reducing agent.",

        "abstract": "Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are very potent and most promising anti-AIDS drugs that specifically inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). However, to a great extent, the efficacy of NNRTI drugs is impaired by rapid emergence of drug-resistance mutations. Fortunately, detailed analysis of a wide range of crystal structures of HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes together with data on drug resistance mutations has identified factors important for design of inhibitors and resilience to mutations, such as, exhibiting conformational flexibility and positional adaptability of NNRTIs, forming extensive main chain hydrogen bonding, targeting highly conserved residues in HIV-1 RT and possessing unconventional mechanisms for NNRTI-mediated inhibition of RT. Besides, the plasticity of NNRTIs binding pocket (NNIBP) also provides a broad space for the discovery of new generations of NNRTIs. For instance, the composite binding pocket, integrated all available crystal structure information about the NNRTI binding site of HIV RT, was demonstrated to be an effective tool to better understand the flexible nature of the binding pocket and to identify specific inhibitors. The RT/solvent interface proved to be an attractive site for incorporating a moiety to improve water solubility and pharmacokinetics or introducing a second pharmacophore to construct multifunctional ligand. Totally, the characterization of NNRTIs and NNIBP may help in the design of more effective drugs that are potent toward wild type and drug-resistant strains of RT. In this paper we attempt to translate the general knowledge gained from a large number of related literature into a set of medicinal chemistry strategies to improve the drug resistance profile of NNRTIs.",

        "abstract": "This study was aimed to investigate the effect of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway on the biologic behavior of mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mBM-MSC) by constructing a RNAi lentiviral vector specific to β-catenin. Three pairs of shRNA coding sequences directed against different sites of β-catenin mRNA were designed and were linked into lentiviral vector plasmid PLB for constructing the PLB-β-catenin/shRNA1, PLB-β-catenin/shRNA2 and PLB-β-catenin/ shRNA3. Those plasmids and lentiviral packaging plasmids were co-transfected into the packaging cells 293FT, then the virus particles were collected and the viral titer was assayed after concentration, and these viral particles were infected to MSC. The flow cytometry was used to sort GFP (+) cells, Western blot and RT-PCR were used to verify the inhibitory effect of those cells on expression of β-catenin gene in cells, CCK-8 method was used to detect the cell proliferation level, Annexin-V/7-AAD was used to determine the cell apoptosis after interference, the cell scratch and transwell tests were used to detect the migration capability of MSC. The results showed that the efficient inhibition of β-catenin mRNA and protein expression, and the suppression of MSC proliferation were observed in group of PLB-β-catenin/shRNA2 (interference group), while there was no significant changes of MSC proliferation between negative group (PLB group) and the normal group (control group). The flow cytometric detection indicated that after induced by serum starvation for 72 h, the apoptosis of MSC increased in interference group, but there was no difference between PLB and control groups (P > 0.05). The cell scratch and transwell tests demonstrated that the migration capability of MSC in interference group decreased significantly, while the migration capability of MSC in control group was not changed obviously. It is concluded that the constructed specific RNAi lentivirus can effectively inhibit the expression of β-catenin gene, decrease expression level of β-catenin mRNA and protein. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in biological behavior of BM-MSC.",

        "abstract": "The recently identified potent greenhouse gas, trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride (SF 5 CF 3 ), is studied using the hybrid density-functional method. Geometry optimization and frequency analysis show that the energy favorable torsional angle is zero. At room temperature, the CF 3 group of the molecule is predicted to rotate freely along the F–S–C axis. An energy gap of 8.87 eV near the Fermi level indicates the absence of excited states within a few eV above the ground state. The vertical and adiabatic ion potentials and electronic affinities are obtained. Large values of the ion potentials suggest that the ionization of SF 5 CF 3 is not favorable in energy. The experimental Fourier transform infrared spectrum of SF 5 CF 3 in the 600–3800 cm −1 region is well reproduced by our calculations.",

Most of the tested compounds exhibited moderate activities against wild-type HIV-1. Among them, compound 6k showed significant activity against wild-type HIV-1 with an EC(50) value of 1.7μM, along with moderate activity against wild-type reverse transcriptase (RT). The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) and docking calculations of this new series of compounds were also investigated, which may help designing more potent molecules.",

In contrast, the levels of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 were up-regulated in MM patients compared to healthy controls while IL-22 was down-regulated (P<0.05). The expression patterns of them were differentially present in various groups according to the International Staging System (ISS) criteria. Up-regulated IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 may potentially down-regulate the expression of several miRNAs in MM patients.

        "abstract": "This letter proposes a new motion compensation approach for high-squint and high-resolution airborne spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) integrated with polar format algorithm (PFA). The motion error is coarsely compensated by means of measuring systems. In PFA, the expressions of the line-of-sight polar interpolation are first explicitly revealed, and the nonsystematic range cell migration (NsRCM) induced by residual motion error is also corrected, which paves the way for autofocus application. After the NsRCM correction, the enhanced total least square estimator-based phase adjustment by contrast enhancement (PACE) algorithm is considered to account for the residual phase errors extended to the range-dependent case. The processing results of airborne SAR real data are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Supramolecular catalysis has become a hot topic in chemistry. To understand the origin of supramolecular catalysis, the catalytic mechanism of a synthetic cavitand receptor with an inwardly directed carboxylic acid for ring-opening cyclization of epoxy alcohols was investigated by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results reveal that the epoxy alcohol can be ring-opened via backside attack of the hydroxyl group to the epoxy group and cyclized in 5-exo and 6-endo modes. The carboxylic acid can catalyze the ring-opening cyclization of the epoxy alcohol through organocatalysis, since the carboxyl group can easily provide a proton to protonate the epoxy group. The synthetic cavitand receptor with an inwardly directed carboxylic acid can further catalyze the ring-opening cyclization of an epoxy alcohol through organocatalysis and supramolecular catalysis as a result of the hydrogen-bonding and C–H···π interactions formed between the receptor and substrate. Furthermore, the special st...",

        "abstract": "Clean hydrogen production is highly desirable for future energy needs, making the understanding of molecular-level phenomena underlying photocatalytic hydrogen production both fundamentally and practically important. Water splitting on pure TiO2 is inefficient, however, adding sacrificial methanol could significantly enhance the photocatalyzed H2 production. Therefore, understanding the photochemistry of methanol on TiO 2 at the molecular level could provide important insights to its photocatalytic activity. Here, we report the first clear evidence of photocatalyzed splitting of methanol on TiO2 derived from time-dependent two-photon photoemission (TD-2PPE) results in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). STM tip induced molecular manipulation before and after UV light irradiation clearly reveals photocatalytic bond cleavage, which occurs only at Ti4+ surface sites. TD-2PPE reveals that the kinetics of methanol photodissociation is clearly not of single exponential, an important characteristic of this intrinsically heterogeneous photoreaction. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of piperlongumine on MM cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Piperlongumine inhibited the proliferation of MM cells by inducing cell apoptosis and blocking osteoclastogenesis. Notably, piperlongumine also reduced bortezomib resistance in MM cells. In a disseminated MM mouse model, piperlongumine prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice without causing any obvious toxicity. Mechanistically, piperlongumine inhibited the STAT3 signal pathway in MM cells by binding directly to the STAT3 Cys712 residue. These findings suggest that the clinical use of piperlongumine to overcome bortezomib resistance in MM should be evaluated.",

The morphologies and structures of the as-prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The gas sensing properties of the sensor based on the as-prepared α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers were investigated in detail. The experimental results exhibited that our product held rapid response-recovery and high sensitivity characteristics to ethanol vapor. The response and recovery time of the sensor to C 2 H 5 OH vapor (from 100 to 5000 ppm) are about 3 and 5 s, respectively. Keywords A. Nanostructure A. Oxides A. Semiconductors B. Sol–gel chemistry",

Here, we report a simple method for the growth of quasi-free-standing single layer blue phosphorus on tellurium functionalized Au(111) by using black phosphorus as the precursor. In situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) measurements were used to monitor the growth of the single-layer blue phosphorus, which forms triangular structures arranged hexagonally on the tellurium layer. As revealed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, LT-STM measurements, and density functional theory calculation, the blue phosphorus layer weakly interacts with the underlying tellurium layer.",

        "abstract": "Due to Earth’s rotation and an elliptical satellite orbit, large Doppler centroids along satellite orbit inevitably occur in geosynchronous Earth orbit synthetic aperture radar (GEOSAR). Nonzero Doppler centroid causes a large range migration, which complicates the data acquisition and design of imaging algorithms. Thus, beam steering is used to decrease the centroid. At the same time, the ground observation of interest is prerequisite for applications. Thus, a unique two-dimensional (2-D) beam-steering method to simultaneously consider the reduction of Doppler centroid and ground observation for the GEOSAR is studied. The minimum-Doppler plane is proposed to minimize the centroid and to guarantee the beams that illuminate the area of interest. Subsequently, to achieve required ground coverage, beam directions determined by the minimum-Doppler plane are slightly adjusted. The method has been validated through the simulation of two types of orbits.",

        "abstract": "Chemical vapour deposition on a Cu substrate is becoming a very important approach to obtain high quality graphene samples. Previous studies of graphene growth on Cu mainly focus on surface processes. However, recent experiments suggest that gas-phase dynamics also plays an important role in graphene growth. In this article, gas-phase processes are systematically studied using computational fluid dynamics. Our simulations clearly show that graphene growth is limited by mass transport under ambient pressures while it is limited by surface reactions under low pressures. The carbon deposition rate at different positions in the tube furnace and the concentration of different gas phase species are calculated. Our results confirm that the previously realized graphene thickness control by changing the position of the Cu foil is a result of gas-phase methane decomposition reactions. ",

        "abstract": "Many patients suffer from chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) following surgery, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present work, using the skin/muscle incision retraction (SMIR) model, the role of spinal TLR4/TNF-α pathway in the induction of CPSP was evaluated.Mechanical allodynia induced by SMIR was established in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The von Frey test was performed to evaluate the role of TLR4/TNF-α pathway on the mechanical allodynia. Western-blot and immunohistochemistry methods were adopted to understand the molecular mechanisms.SMIR surgery decreased the ipsilateral 50 % paw withdrawal threshold, lasting for at least 20 days. Western-blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that SMIR surgery significantly upregulated the expression of TLR4 (p < 0.01) in glial cells on the ipsilateral side of spinal cord and increased TLR4 occurred on day 5 and was maintained to the end of the experiment (day 20). Similarly, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was significantly increased on days 5, 10, and 20 on the ipsilateral side of spinal dorsal horn following SMIR surgery. Intraperitoneal injection of an inhibitor of TNF-α synthesis thalidomide at 50 or 100 mg/kg dose (but not 10 mg/kg dose) significantly ameliorated the reduced paw withdrawal threshold induced by SMIR surgery. Importantly, intrathecal delivery of a specific TLR4 antagonist (LPS-RS) at dose of 25 μg significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and prevented the upregulation of TNF-α induced by SMIR surgery.These findings suggest that the upregulation of TNF-α via TLR4 contributes to the development of CPSP in spinal dorsal horn.",

        "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disorder characterized by immune-mediated platelet destruction, leading to lower platelet count. Thalidomide is considered as a novel immunomodulatory drug for treating several autoimmune diseases. Whether thalidomide can ameliorate ITP remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of thalidomide on ITP mouse model. ITP mouse model was established through intraperitoneal injection of rat anti-mouse integrin GPIIb/CD41 immunoglobulin. Thalidomide (10, 20 or 50 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally injected into mice followed by antibody injection. Then, peripheral blood and plasma was isolated for analysis of platelet count and the level of IFN-γ and IL-17 in plasma. Meanwhile, spleen was extracted to measure the expression of CD68, a macrophage marker. In addition, macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was cultured and treated with thalidomide followed by analysis of cell viability, apoptosis as well as cell cycle. Thalidomide prevented antiplatelet antibody-mediated platelet destruction in ITP mouse model. Compared with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline), thalidomide significantly inhibited the secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17 in ITP mouse and reduced the expression of CD68 in spleen. After thalidomide treatment, the cell viability of RAW264.7 cell was significantly reduced and the cell number in S phase was also significantly decreased. In addition, the expression of cyclin E2 was significantly reduced. In conclusion, thalidomide prevents antiplatelet antibody-mediated platelet destruction in ITP mouse possibly through reducing the number of macrophages, suggesting that it might be a novel approach for treating ITP.",

Each of the wasps tested was infected with Group Kue and Pip Wolbachia, the double infection rate was 100%. After reared on the eggs of Corcyra cephalonica Stainton under different temperature for many generations, T.chilonis was found infected with the same Wolbachia strains and 100% infection rate. This suggested that Wolbachia vertically transmitted stably in T.chilonis and is not affected by temperature directly. In this study, T.chilonis were sexual or arrhenotoky and Wolbachia didn’t induce parthenogenesis in the wasps. This is the first report about the distribution and genetic stability of Wolbachia in T.chilonis in China.",

METHODS: Two positive drugs were employed to intervene the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced rat depression model. The behavioral changes of rats were observed; meanwhile, urine samples were collected and subjected to GC-MS analysis to find potential biomarkers of depression. RESULTS: The behavioral data of the drug treatment groups were significantly different (P < 0.05) with the model group, showing obvious antidepressant effect. Metabolomic analysis showed that venlafaxine group located closer to the healthy controls, showing better antidepressant efficacy than fluoxetine. Fifteen potential biomarkers were identified from the loading plot between control and model group, and more perturbed metabolites were reversed by venlafaxine. CONCLUSION: Both drugs have significant antidepressant efficacy, and venlafaxine shows better effect. Metabolomic approach was applied in this study to analyze the regulation of biomarkers and compare the mechanisms of the two drugs. These results provide new methods for the evaluation of drug efficacy.",

Recently, germline JAK2 mutations are also associated with triple-negative MPNs. A novel germline mutation JAK2 V625F is reported to be involved in a subset of MPNs patients. However, the pathogenesis of this mutation caused MPN is still unclear. In this study, the homology models of JAK2 V625F showed that the newly formed interaction between F625 and Y613 disrupted the JAK2 JH1-JH2 domain interactions was responsible for its activation, when F625 and Y613 interaction was disrupted, its activity significantly decreased. While, when this interaction was repaired whether by forming hydrogen bond or salt bond, it would cause JAK2 activation. Biochemical studies also demonstrated that JAK2 V625F mutation led to JAK2-STAT5 pathway activation and promoted the proliferation of BaF3 cells. Thus, our results herein provide clues to understand the mechanism JAK2 V625F mutation caused MPNs and give information for the development of JAK2 mutation specific inhibitors.",

The understanding of this clinical condition is hampered by the lack of suitable animal models. Here, we present a murine (BALB/c-based) model of HVOD induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The chimerism rate of bone marrow was measured on days 5 and 10, while the chimerism rate of peripheral blood was measured on day 15 after allo-HSCT. Percentages of peripheral reticulocytes and serum levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase (as liver function tests) were measured on days 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30. Livers were obtained on days 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30, and fixed in formaldehyde or glutaric dialdehyde. Liver slices were processed using the hematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome, or immunohistochemistry staining, and examined by light or transmission electron microscopy. Sinusoidal damages were the earliest pathological changes occurring in the allo-HSCT-induced HVOD, followed by coagulative necrosis of liver cells. The liver cell necrosis was later attenuated and sinusoidal endothelial cell morphology improved. However, on day 30, the edema and necrosis of liver cells became aggravated again. Furthermore, sinusoidal lining cell regeneration and partly attenuated liver cell necrosis were followed by the moderate to severe central vein fibrosis. In conclusion, we have successfully established a murine model of HSCT-HVOD. This model develops moderate to severe HVOD which cannot heal without intervention.",

        "abstract": "Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides represent an emerging class of layered materials exhibiting various intriguing properties, and integration of such materials for potential device applications will necessarily invoke further reduction of their dimensionality. Using first-principles approaches, here we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties along the two different edges of zigzag MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) nanoribbons. Along the M edges, we reveal a previously unrecognized but energetically strongly preferred (2 × 1) reconstruction pattern, which is universally operative for all the four systems (and possibly more), characterized by an elegant self-passivation mechanism through place exchanges of the outmost X and M edge atoms. In contrast, the X edges undergo a much milder (2 × 1) or (3 × 1) reconstruction for MoX2 or WX2, respectively. These contrasting structural preferences of the edges can be exploited for controlled fabrication of properly tailored transition m...",

To obtain LCc-ECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with conditioned cell culture media from human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. The effect of fasudil on the viability of LCc-ECs was assessed using the MTT assay, in vitro invasive ability was evaluated using the transwell chamber assay and cytoskeletal changes were detected using fluorescein-labelled phalloidin immunocytochemistry. RhoA mRNA and p-MLC protein expression were measured using RT-PCR and western blotting. Fasudil significantly and dose-dependently inhibited LCc-EC proliferation and in vitro invasive ability. Fasudil also led to stress fibre breakage and fracture in LCc-ECs, indicating that fasudil impacts polymerisation of the cytoskeletal actin filament network. Expression of RhoA mRNA and protein expression of the ROCK substrate p-MLC were reduced by fasudil, suggesting that fasudil can inhibit RhoA/ROCK signalling and attenuate angiogenesis in LCc-ECs. This study indicates that fasudil is an anti-angiogenic agent with potential application for the treatment of cancer, especially lung adenocarcinoma.",

Three myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, U266 and H929) were used. Forty-five patients with multiple myeloma were enrolled in the study. The expression of B7-H3 was detected by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. The relationship between B7-H3 and clinical prognostic factor was analyzed. The results showed that (1)In myeloma cell lines, high expression of B7-H3 was seen in RPMI8226 (92.30 ± 1.1)% and U266 (79.03 ± 1.2)% but not in H929 cell line (4.26 ± 0.2)%. (2) Exogenous IL-6 had no effect on upregulation of B7-H3 in myeloma cell lines. (3) In multiple myeloma patients, the proportions of B7-H3 positive cells in newly diagnosed, remission and relapsed patients were (48.58 ± 33.593)%, (22.16 ± 18.853)%, and (57.65 ± 28.296)%, respectively. The difference between the newly diagnosed and remission patients, and remission and relapsed patients was significant (P = 0.023, P = 0.004). (4)High B7-H3 expression was correlated with high numbers of bone destruction and high levels of serum calcium (P = 0.027, P = 0.046, respectively). It is concluded that the relation of B7-H3 molecule expression with prognosis of multiple myeloma may be negative, but with degree of bone destruction is positive, thus the high expression of B7-H3 may correlated with disease progression and bone destruction of patients with multiple myeloma.",

The trend for small Au clusters to form planar structures is weaker when some Au atoms are substituted by Cu atoms. A significant odd-even oscillation of the electron affinity of the cationic clusters with the number of their Au or Cu atoms is observed. CO prefers binding to Cu, which can be understood by the frontier molecular orbital theory. Its binding energy on AunCum + generally decreases with the increase of the Cu content in the cluster, which is highly related to the electron transfer between CO and the cluster. Our calculation suggests that reactive collision between CO and Au 3Cu+ may lead to the dissociation of the cluster with an Au atom loss. © the Owner Societies.",

The effective nearest-neighbor interaction between nitrogen dopants is found to be highly repulsive because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between nitrogen atoms. This interaction prevents the full nitrogen-carbon phase separation in nitrogen-doped graphene. Interestingly, there are two relatively stable nitrogen-nitrogen pair configurations, whose stability can be attributed to the anisotropy in the charge redistribution induced by nitrogen doping. We reveal two stable, ordered, semiconducting N-doped graphene structures, C 3N and C 12N, through the cluster-expansion technique and particle-swarm optimization method. In particular, we show that C 12N has a direct band gap of 0.98 eV. The heterojunctions between C 12N and graphene nanoribbons might be a promising basis for organic solar cells.",

Methods: From August 1997 to December 2006, 44 cases had been performed lumbar operation (28 males and 16 females, aged from 27 to 78, averagely 51.6 years). All patients were be selected according to an unified standard, and examined lumbar anterior and lateral position X-ray film, lumbar dynamics position X-Ray film and MRI. 9 cases were inspected in discography. The operation style included semi or total laminectomy, single or multiply segments fenestration, denaturalization or protrudent nucleus pulposus tissues excision, varied internal fixation and intervertebral or intertransverse bone grafting fusion. All patients worn outer fixation brace 3 months after operation and followed up at regular intervals. Results: The diagnosis standard of the degenerative lumbar instability should be defined as follows: excessive flexion displacement >8% or excessive extension displacement >9% in L4/5; excessive flexion displacement >6% or excessive extension displacement >9% in L5/S1; the endplate angle exceed in 10°or 4 mm vertebral body displacement in anteroposterior position in X-Ray film. All patients were followed up from 6 to 52 months with the average of 20.4 months. The total amendatory ratio was 66% according to the JOA grade. Conclusions: 1.The surgery operation should be considered only to those patients who posses typical clinical symptoms, images varying and conservative treatment in vain; 2. Validation depression, appropriate fixation and proper handle intervertebral disc are important methods; 3. The discography and flexibility fixation are worth further study in degenerative lumbar instability.",

        "abstract": "We review advances in understanding the production, eco-physiological roles, and related regulatory mechanism of green leaf volatiles (GLVs). GLVs are six-carbon aldehydes, alcohols and esters derived from the hydroperoxide lyase branch of the octadecanoic acid pathway in plants. Besides leaves, other tissues such as root, stem, fruit, and seed are also reported to be capable of producing the GLVs regulated at the levels of transcription and post-transcription in plants. GLVs composition and amounts are influenced by the developmental stage and growth environment such as seasonal change in a given plant. In addition, the formation of GLVs can be induced by biotic stress such as insect attack, inoculation of pathogenic bacteria and inhabitation of beneficial fungi, as well as abiotic ones such as nitrogen deficiency. Although GLVs are primarily recognized as important contributors to unique flavors, they also play important roles in direct and indirect defense responses. They not only inhibit the reproduction of bacteria, fungi and insects, but also induce the synthesis of various defensive compounds. They can also prime different signal induction pathways. The potential roles that GLVs played in the quality formation of Chinese herbs, especially genuine ones, are discussed based on their wide distribution and multi-layered defensive roles in plants. It is necessary and urgent to carry out related research on GLVs in Chinese herbs for their sustainable and green development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Immune thrombocytopenia is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, characterized by accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Bcl-xL and Bax play an opposite role in the regulation of apoptotic process with Bcl-xL for cell survival and Bax for cell apoptosis. Given the critical roles in the regulation of platelet apoptosis, whether Bcl-xL or Bax was involved in the pathogenesis of ITP remains unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression profile of Bcl-xL and Bax in platelets treated with ITP plasma. Normal washed platelets were treated with plasma from 20 active ITP patients or 10 age and gender-matched control to mimic the ITP in vivo environment. Mitochondrial depolarization, platelet apoptosis and activation were measured by flow cytometry. Expression of Bcl-xL, Bax and caspase-3 were also measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Our results demonstrated increased mitochondrial depolarization, platelet apoptosis and activation in platelets after treated with ITP plasma in comparison to control. In addition, decreased expression of Bcl-xL, increased expression of Bax and activity of caspase-3 were also observed. Furthermore, a negative correlation of Bcl-xL with Bax was found in platelets treated with ITP plasma. In conclusion, imbalanced expression of Bcl-xL and Bax might be associated with platelet apoptosis in ITP and therapeutically targeting them might be a novel approach in the treatment of ITP.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of endostar on the expression of VEGF165b, and determine the effect of VEGF165b for he sensitivity of tumor cell to endostar. METHODS: The expression of VEGF165b of SMMC-7721 was detective by RT-PCR and Western Blotting after treated with endostar. After transfected with VEGF165b, the expression of HIF-1α and its downstream target genes VEGFA was analyzed by RT-PCR and Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. SMMC-7721 cell was transfected with VEGF165b or empty vector, and then treated with endostar, the cell growth inhibiting rate was detected by methly thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). RESULTS: High dose endostar at 100 and 400 μg/mL up-regulated the expression of VEGF165b, while VEGF165b suppressed the expression of HIF-1α and its downstream target genes VEGFA. After transfection with empty-vector, treatment of SMMC-7721 cell with 500 and 1 000 μg/mL endostar induced the tumour cell growth inhibiting rate at 1.6% and 0.4% individually. After transfection with VEGF165b, treatment of SMMC-7721 cell with 500 and 1 000 μg/mL endostar induced the tumour cell growth inhibiting rate at 8.5% (P=0.000 0) and 20.2%( P=0.000 0) individually. CONCLUSIONS: Endostar can inhibite tumour growth and anti-angiogenisis partly via VEGF165b, and VEGF165b sensitize the tumour cell to endostar. VEGF165b and endostar have synergistic effect on tumor suppression.",

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF(165))-mediated autocrine stimulation of tumor cells enhances the progression to a malignant phenotype. VEGF(165)b competes with VEGF(165) and binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), resulting in inhibition of downstream signal transduction pathways. This study was designed to investigate the role of VEGF(165)b in the migration and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. The full-length of VEGF(165)b was constructed and cloned into an expression plasmid (pVEGF(165)b), and then transfected into A549 cells. Dimethylthiazolyl- 1 -2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect the effect of VEGF(165)b on proliferation of transfected cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to examine the effect of VEGF(165)b on the expression of VEGF(165) in transfected cells. Wound-healing assays were used to investigate the effect of VEGF(165)b on migration of transfected cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) activity assay and in vitro invasion assay were used to determine the role of VEGF(165)b in invasion of transfected cells. There was no significant change in proliferation of A549 cells after transfection of pVEGF(165)b, but the expression of VEGF(165), migration and invasion in A549 cells were inhibited. Furthermore, exogenous VEGF(165)b inhibited the activity of MMP9 in the supernatant of A549 cells and the subsequent invasion capacity of those cells. We therefore conclude that exogenous VEGF(165)b can inhibit the expression of VEGF(165), as well as the migration and invasion of A549 cells, but has no effect on the proliferation of A549 cells.",

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an extremely serious plasma cell malignancy. Despite recent introduction of chemotherapies such as bortezomib and lenalidomide, it remains an incurable disease due to high rate of relapse and development of drug resistance. Epigenetic regulation is closely related with MM progression; nevertheless, the epigenetic modification mechanism of myeloma cell apoptosis has remained unclear. As a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, Scriptaid's possible roles in MM progression have not been explored. Herein, we found that Scriptaid decreased several human MM cell viabilities in a dose-dependent manner. Scriptaid was also able to dose-dependently induce MM cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase significantly. Moreover, HDAC inhibitor Scriptaid facilitates p21 transcriptional activities by mediating the H3Ac gene-activated modification, eventually leading to multiple myeloma cell apoptosis. Overall, our results defined Scriptaid as an inducer of MM cell death and presented opportunity for Scriptaid-mediated therapeutics to cure refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma.",

In this study, we investigated the\n RASSF2A expression and its methylation status in a cohort of 45 hepatitis B virus-associated HCC tissues and their adjacent\n non-carcinoma tissues by using RT-PCR and MS-PCR. Promoter methylation of RASSF2A was found in 31 (68.9%) out of 45 HCC tissues\n and 12 (40%) out of 30 adjacent normal tissues, respectively (P<0.05). The methylation status of PASSF2A was closely associated with the loss of RASSF2A expression and elevated serum α-fetoprotein\n level, but not significantly with clinical stage, hepatic fibrosis and K-ras mutation. It was concluded that aberrant methylation\n of the RASSF2A gene with the subsequent loss of RASSF2A expression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC.\n ",

Co-injection of engineered Tregs with donor bone marrow cells and splenocytes prevented recipients from lethal GVHD. Furthermore, we showed that graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect against EL4/DsRed leukemic cells was maximally preserved while GVHD was minimized during exposure to engineered Tregs in a mouse leukemia model.

        "abstract": "Creatine kinase (CK) is a key enzyme for cellular energy metabolism, catalyzing the reversible phosphoryl transfer from phosphocreatine to ADP in vertebrates. CK contains a pair of highly conserved amino acids (H66 and D326) which might play an important role in sustaining the compact structure of CK by linking its N- and C- terminal domains; however the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, spectroscopic, structural modeling and protein folding experiments suggested that D326A, H66P and H66P/D326A mutations led to disruption of the hydrogen bond between those two amino acid residues and form the partially unfolded state which made it easier to be inactivated and unfolded under environmental stresses, and more prone to form insoluble aggregates. The formation of insoluble aggregates would decrease levels of active CKs which may provide clues in CK deficiency disease. Moreover, these results indicated that the degree of synergism had closely relationship to the conformational changes of CK. Thus, our results provided clues for understanding the mechanism of amino acid residues outside the active site in regulating substrate synergism.",

        "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can modulate gene expression through different mechanisms, but the fundamental molecular mechanism between lncRNAs and MET protein in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was poorly understood. The expression of lncRNA TUG1 and MET in DLBCL tissues and cell lines was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were determined by cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometer. The animal xenograft model was established by the injection of DLBCL cells carrying si-TUG1. The expression of TUG1 and MET was upregulated in DLBCL tissues and cells. We demonstrated that MET was altered in the TUG1 knockdown DLBCL cells, and confirmed the interaction between TUG1 and MET by RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, knockdown of TUG1 reduced MET protein level by promoting ubiquitination, and suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that TUG1 exerted its oncogenic function in DLBCL by inhibiting the ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of MET. Knockdown of TUG1 through MET downregulation suppressed DLBCL cell proliferation and tumor growth.",

Geometric and electronic structures of the quasi-1D chains of intercalated alkali metal atoms at experimental loading (4 metal atoms per 32 Si) are studied. Clear differences between different kinds of alkali metal are found, with a general trend of decreased ionization and less metallic character for the lighter alkali metals. Within the zeolite channels, it is possible to form insulated and metallic alkali metal chains by doping Na or Rb. Agreeing with experiments, only Rb here is found to be a good candidate to generate inorganic electride. We also predict that a large quantity of Na can be doped into the zeolite channel, while no more than 4 Rb per 16 Si can be doped.",

C57Bl6, and BALB/c mice received total body irradiation followed by infusion of C57Bl6-derived bone marrow (BM) cells, with or without concomitant infusion of C57Bl6-derived EPCs. The time course of hematopoietic and immune reconstitution and the severity of the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were monitored. Further, to confirm that EPCs promote endothelial cell recovery, HSCT mice were treated with anti-VE-cadherin antibody targeting the endothelium. The EPCs-treated mice exhibited accelerated recovery of BM vasculature, cellularity, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell recovery, improved counts of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood, and facilitated spleen structure reconstruction. EPCs infusion also ameliorated the GVHD in the C57Bl6 → BALB/c allo-HSCT model. Systemic administration of anti-VE-cadherin antibody significantly delayed hematological and immune reconstitution in the EPCs-infused mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that infusion of EPCs augments the hematopoietic and immune reconstitution, and alleviates the GVHD. These findings further highlight the relationship between the microvascular recovery, hematopoietic and immune reconstitution, and the GVHD.",

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were co-transfected using liposome by lentiviral packing system, which included the packaging plasmid Delta NRF, the transfer plasmid and the envelope plasmid VSVG. The efficiency of gene transduction and the expressions of Foxp3, CD25, GITR, CTLA-4 of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, which were isolated by magnetic beads from the spleen, and then co-cultured with 293T cells, were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The proliferative and suppressive capacities of transduced T cells were estimated by Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8) and the cytokine production was performed by ELISA.The lentiviral transfer plasmid pXZ208-Foxp3-IRES-GFP was successfully constructed, the virus titers were above 10(6) IU/ml in the supernatant. pXZ208-IRES-GFP was used as control group. After cocultured, the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells expressed significantly higher Foxp3, CD25, GITR and CTLA-4 in experimental group than in control group. Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 epsilon and APCs, the proliferative capacity of Foxp3-transduced T cells and the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-gamma were significantly lower than those in control group (P < 0.01); Foxp3-transduced T cells also significantly inhibited the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells.The genetic engineering Treg mediated by SIN lentiviral vectors are successfully constructed and their phenotype and function are similar to natural CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg.",

        "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, which is characterized by dysregulation of T cell-mediated autoimmunity. NLRP3, a largest and mostly well-studied inflammasome, has been shown to be important in the regulation of adaptive immune response, especially in T cell response. Given the closely association of imbalance of T cell response with ITP, whether NLRP3 is involved in the pathogenesis of ITP remains poorly understood. In this study, 69 active ITP patients, 21 ITP in remission and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from ITP and control for isolation of RNA and plasma, which were used to measure mRNA level of NLRP3 and adaptor protein ASC by quantitative real-time PCR and IL-18 plasma level by ELISA. Meanwhile, protein was also extracted from PBMCs for Western blot analysis of NLRP3 expression. Our results showed a significantly higher expression of NLRP3, ASC and plasma IL-18 level in patients with active ITP when compared to control. The expression of NLRP3, ASC and plasma IL-18 level was significantly lower in patients in remission than that in active ITP, and no difference was observed when compared to control. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation of NLRP3 with ASC was observed in patients with active ITP. In conclusion, increased expression of NLRP3 was associated with the pathogenesis of ITP and therapeutically targeting it might be a new strategy in the treatment of ITP.",

        "abstract": "To explore gene expression of NANOG in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines and the effects of NANOG gene down-regulation on apoptosis of leukemia cells.Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the expression level of NANOG gene and protein in MOLT-4, CCRF-HSB2 and Jurkat cells. To test the efficiency of RNA interference, MOLT-4 cells were firstly infected by lentiviral vectors, which were successfully constructed with NANOG specific shRNA. NANOG expression levels were subsequently re-evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blot. The percentages of early apoptotic cells (Annexin V⁺/7-AAD⁻) and late apoptotic cells (Annexin V⁺/7-AAD⁺) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis-related genes was also detected.Both NANOG gene and protein expression was positive in MOLT-4 and CCRF-HSB2 cells. The lentiviral vectors pLB-shNANOG-1, pLB-shNANOG-2, and pLB-sh control were successfully constructed, as evidenced by the viral titers (1.83-3.12)× 10⁸ IU/ml. The experimental data on infection of MOLT-4 cells with such lentiviral vectors revealed that both shRNA interfering sequences (shNANOG-1 and shNANOG-2) could stably down-regulate NANOG gene and protein expressions. The percentages of early apoptotic cells in groups of shNANOG-1[(8.06 ± 1.61)%]and shNANOG-2[(5.67 ± 1.59)%]were significantly increased as compared to that of MOLT-4 group[(1.13 ± 0.40)%]or sh-control [(1.15±0.49)%](P<0.05). However, no statistical difference among them was observed for late apoptotic cells (P>0.05). The gene expression of TP53, PMAIP1, and CASP9 of either shNANOG-1 or shNANOG-2 group was augmented as compared to that of MOLT-4 group or sh-control (P<0.05). Reversely, a significant down-regulation of Bcl-2 gene expression was observed (P<0.05).NANOG can be expressed in various human T-ALL cell lines. Down-regulation of NANOG can trigger leukemia cellular apoptosis through mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway.",

        "abstract": "To compare the differences between Hengshanhuangqi (HH) and Chuanhuangqi (CH) at molecular level, 1H NMR based plant metabolomics approach was used to reveal the chemical difference between HH and CH. Then, the contents of astragaloside IV and calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, the marker compounds specified in China Pharmacopoeia, were determined. In addition, the ITS2 fragments of HH and CH were sequenced. Twenty-three metabolites were identified in the 1H NMR spectrum, and the principal component analysis showed CH and HH could be separated clearly. HH contained more aspartic acid, GABA, citric acid, astragaloside IV and calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside, while CH contained more threonine, alanine, acetic acid, choline, arginine, fructose and sucrose. And the astragaloside IV is almost undetectable in CH. In addition, the ITS2 fragment sequences of HH and CH were different at eight bases. Thus, the HH and CH showed significant differences chemically and genetically.",

        "abstract": "The development of new HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) offers the possibility of generating novel chemical entities of increased potency. Previous investigations in our laboratory resulted in the discovery of several novel series of arylazolylthioacetanilides as potent NNRTIs. In this study, based on the structure-based bioisosterism strategy, novel 1,2,4-triazin-6-yl thioacetamide derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-HIV activity in MT-4 cells. Among them, the most promising compound was 8b15 with double-digit nanomolar activity against wild-type HIV-1 (EC(50)=0.018±0.007 μM) and moderate activity against the double mutant strain RES056 (EC(50)=3.3±0.1 μM), which indicated that 1,2,4-triazin-6-yl thioacetamide can be used as a novel scaffold to develop a new class of potent NNRTIs active against both wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. In addition, preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) and molecular modeling results are also briefly discussed, which provide some useful information for the further design of novel NNRTIs.",

        "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not well prevented now. We have observed that interleukin-22 (IL-22) produced by Th22, Th1, and Th17 cells participated in GVHD development in our previous study. However, the role of IL-22 in GVHD is still ambiguous. The aim of this study was to illuminate the pathological or protective function and the potential mechanism of IL-22 in the GVHD process. In the present study, we found that compared with mice cotransferred with bone marrow and spleen cells (BS mice) without IL-22 administration, more serious tissue damage and higher GVHD clinical score were observed in BS+IL-22 mice. IL-22 administration was a benefit to early recovery of thymus after irradiation-induced injury. Administration of IL-22 could promote Th1 and Tc1 cell expansion in mesenteric lymph nodes but reduce CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cell number. Levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) were upregulated, while the level of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 was downregulated in recipients with IL-22 injection. In conclusion, IL-22, which exacerbates both local immune responses and systemic inflammation of recipients, plays a pathogenic role in the GVHD process. The potential mechanism of IL-22 in GVHD may attribute to increased alloreactive effector Th1 and Tc1 cells and decreased inhibitory Treg cell.",

Lentivirus‑mediated expression of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) converted immature DCs (imDCs) from BABL/c mice into engineered DCs in vitro. An EL4 leukemia allo‑BMT model of BABL/c to C57BL/6 mice was established. Engineered DCs with donor bone marrow cells and splenocytes were subsequently transplanted into myeloablatively irradiated recipients. The average survival duration in the sTNFR1‑ and pXZ9‑imDC groups was significantly prolonged compared with that of the allo‑BMT group (P&amp;lt;0.05). Mild histological changes in GVHD or leukemia were observed in the recipients in the sTNFR1‑imDC group and clinical GVHD scores in this group were significantly decreased compared with those of the transplantation and pXZ9‑imDC groups. Serum interferon‑γ levels were decreased in the pXZ9‑imDC and sTNFR1‑imDC groups compared with those in the allo‑BMT group (P&amp;lt;0.05), with the reduction being more significant in the sTNFR1‑imDC group (P&amp;lt;0.05). Serum interleukin‑4 expression levels were decreased in the allo‑BMT group, but gradually increased in the pXZ9‑imDC and sTNFR1‑imDC groups (P&amp;lt;0.05). Co‑injection of donor genetically‑engineered imDCs was able to efficiently protect recipient mice from lethal GVHD while preserving GVL effects during allo‑BMT.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To elucidate the protective roles and the underlying mechanism of Tripterygium hypoglaucum Hutch (THH) in mice graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Methods: BALB/c (H-2kd) mice were firstly treated with total body irradiation and infused with a mixture of bone marrow and spleen cells from C57BL/6. Then the severity of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chimeras of donor cells, inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10) of plasma, and regulatory T cells were evaluated to elucidate the different drug combinations and concentrations of cyclosporin A (CsA) and THH in preventing aGVHD. Results: The control group treated with phosphate buffer solution displayed more obvious ruffled hair, hunched posture, diarrhea, reduced weight and more lymphocytes infiltration into the spleen and intestine than these treated with CsA, THH or low-dosed CsA combined with THH, especially those treated with low-dosed CsA combined with THH. No significant differences were observed in the chimeras of donor cells and survival rate among the CsA, THH, or CsA combined with THH-treated groups. Further studies implied that THH might reduce the aGVHD by increasing IL-10, decreasing IL-4, activating Treg cell, and maintaining a relatively high Foxp3 mRNA level. Conclusion: THH decreased the occurrence of mouse aGVHD and prolonged the survival time by increasing the levels of CD+4/CD+25 T cells, regulating the cytokine secretion and promoting the expression of Foxp3. © W.

The indirect energy gap of planar polysilane turns to be direct upon\nfluorine decoration, and the gap width is mainly determined by fluorine\ncoverage regardless of its distribution on the surface. However, electronic\nstructure of fluorine doped graphane is very sensitive to the doping\nconfiguration, due to the competition between antibonding states and\nnearly-free-electron (NFE) states. With specific fluorine distribution pattern,\nzero-dimensional and one-dimensional NFE states can be obtained. We have also\nstudied the chemical modification with -OH or -NH$_2$ group.

        "abstract": "Cardamonin, a natural chalcone compound, has been reported to exert anticancer effects in several cancers. However, the specific pharmacological actions of cardamonin on human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the potential mechanisms still remain obscure. Here, we investigated the antineoplastic role of cardamonin in NSCLC both in vitro and in vivo. The proliferation of five NSCLC cell lines was inhibited in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner with cardamonin treatment. In A549 and H460 cells, cardamonin induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3, upregulating Bax, and downregulating Bcl-2. In addition, cardamonin arrested cells in the G2/M phase and inhibited the expression levels of cyclin D1/CDK4. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were suppressed by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition with cardamonin treatment. Further study showed that cardamonin reduced the phosphorylation levels of the downstream effectors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), including protein kinase-B (Akt/PKB) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Moreover, in the H460 xenograft model, cardamonin significantly retarded tumor growth. Also, in tumor tissues, we found that cardamonin treatment decreased the expression rates of Ki-67, p-Akt, and p-mTOR. These data suggest that cardamonin suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and inhibited metastasis partly by restraining the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and it might be an effective therapeutic compound for NSCLC in the future.",

Objective: To investigate the differentiation from BMSCs into neuron-like cells induced by fetal spinal cord tissue. Design: Observational study. Setting: Department of Spine Surgery, Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen. Materials: SD rats (16 pregnant days old and 2 months old) were provided by Animal Center, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Single antibody of NSE, multi-antibody of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and single antibody of neurofilament (NF200) were provided by Wuhan Boster Company. Methods: The experiment was carried out in Immune Opening Laboratory and Central Laboratory, Basic Medical Department, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in September 2006. Bones of lower extremities of rats were collected to centrifuge BMSCs. Fetal spinal cord tissue homogenate was extracted from 16 pregnant days old rats to make inducing solution and induce differentiation of BMSCs. Otherwise, embryo muscle tissue was used to make muscle tissue homogenate as the same way so as to regard as the controls. Main Outcome Measures: BMSCs underwent morphological observation after induction; in addition, anti-NSE, NF200 and anti-GFAP were used to label neurons and astrocytes, respectively. Ten non-overlapping sights were randomly selected from positive reactive-induced cells after immunohistochemical staining under optic microscope to calculate ratio of positive cells of NSE and NF200 counting for total numbers of cells. Results: 1 Morphological changes of BMSCs after induction: During early induction, optic microscope indicated that soma of partial cells rebounded; whose apophysis was long and thin; apophysis of differentiated cells grew gradually and intercrossed each other. It was similar to nerve cells and some branches were similar to dendrite branches. However, morphological changes of cells in the control group were not obvious. 2 Expression of relevant antigens differentiated from BMSCs into neuron-like cells at one week after induction: Most cells in spinal cord homogenate group expressed as positive NSE and NF200; a few of cells expressed as GFAP. While, positive staining of nerve cell antibody was not observed in the control group; meanwhile, positive reaction of nerve cell antigen was not observed in the control group, too. Immunohistochemistry examination demonstrated that positive rates of NSE and NF200 expressions were (68±1.7)% and (76.2±2.9)%, respectively. Conclusion: Fetal spinal cord tissue homogenate can induce differentiation from BMSCs into neuron-like cells.",

        "abstract": "Cu substrates are highly preferred for the potential mass production of high-quality graphene, yet many of the important aspects of the atomistic growth mechanisms involved remain to be explored. Using multiscale modeling, we identify C-C dimers as the dominant feeding species in the epitaxial growth of graphene on both Cu(111) and Cu(100) substrates. By contrasting the different activation energies involved in C-C dimer diffusion on terraces and its attachment at graphene island edges, we further reveal why graphene growth is diffusion limited on Cu(111), but attachment limited on Cu(100). We also find even higher potential energy barriers against dimer diffusion along the island edges; consequently, a dendritic-to-compact transition is predicted to take place during graphene enlargement on either substrate, but at different growth temperatures. These findings serve as new insights for better control of epitaxial graphene growth. ",

        "abstract": "The efficiency of the intravascular delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) homing to bone marrow has been largely limited. This study aimed to evaluate the homing efficacy in irradiated mice of MSCs that have been engineered to overexpress the murine Cxcr4 gene. Mouse MSCs were infected by a lentivirus vector carrying Cxcr4. MSC migration was detected by an in vitro transwell migration assay. EGFP-positive MSCs were systemically injected into BALB/c mice and detected in bone marrow samples by flow cytometry. The concentration of mouse stromal-derived factor 1 was detected by ELISA. The plasma concentration of the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, MCP-1, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-12p70, were determined by cytometric bead array. MSCs that overexpressed Cxcr4 displayed enhanced migration toward a stromal-derived factor 1 gradient. The transplantation of Cxcr4-overexpressing MSCs into irradiated mice leads to increased homing to the bone marrow. Moreover, the frequency of the EGFP-positive cells in a bone marrow infusion 24 h after total body irradiation was 2.2-fold more than at 4 h after irradiation. The concentration of both plasma and bone marrow stromal-derived factor 1 increased after irradiation, and this was positively correlated with the number of Cxcr4-overexpressing MSCs homing to the bone marrow. Moreover, compared with the control groups, the plasma levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and MCP-1 and IL-12p70 in recipients infused with Cxcr4-overexpressing MSCs was significantly decreased. The level of IL-10 was increased, which correlated with changes in the Th1 and Th2 subset balance. MSCs that overexpressed Cxcr4 and were injected into irradiated mice had an enhanced homing capacity which was related to the bone marrow level of stromal-derived factor 1.",

Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to characterize nanowire morphology and structure. Ethanol sensing performance analyzed in the range of temperatures and concentrations showed that Co-doped In(2)O(3) nanowires exhibited significantly enhanced sensitivity and rate of performance with the response and recovery times of 2s and 3s, respectively. Combined with excellent selectivity and linearity, these properties make the fabricated nanowires a good candidate for practical ethanol sensing. Further performance improvements are possible with utilization of nanofiber continuity intrinsic of the used top-down nanowire nanomanufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "The established chemical synthetic strategy toward graphene nanoribbons has greatly prompted and justified the research of theoretical designs of novel materials based on graphene. In this paper, we report the novel half-metallicity in C and BN hybrid zigzag nanoribbons even though stand-alone C or BN nanoribbon possesses a finite band gap. By performing first-principles electronic-structure calculations, we find this unexpected half-metallicity in the hybrid nanostructures stems from a competition between the charge and spin polarizations, as well as from the pi orbital hybridization between C and BN. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the hybrid nanoribbons are stable. Our results point out a possibility of making spintronic devices solely based on nanoribbons and a new way of fabricating metal-free half metals.",

        "abstract": "To establish strategies for preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD) and reducing treatment associated morbidity while preserving graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect in nonmyeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), with or without donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after BMT.3 x 10(7) bone marrow cells mixed with 1 x 10(7) spleen cells from the same BALB/c mouse were transplanted into the nonablative irradiated inbred 615 mouse which received a single subcutaneous injection of 1 x 10(6) L615 leukemia cells three days before. The experiments were designed as follows (ten mice in each group): myeloablative BMT control group (group A), nonmyeloablative conditioning without BMT group (group B), nonmyeloablative BMT group (group C), and nonmyeloablative BMT + DLI group (group D). GVL effects were assessed by survival time, white blood cell count and L615 cells in peripheral blood and histologic changes. GVHD was assessed by signs of weight loss, ruffled fur, diarrhea and histologic changes of skin, liver and small intestines. Chimerism was detected by cytogenetic analysis and PCR technique.The survival time of group A, B, C and D was (20.3 +/- 13.4), (15.9 +/- 1.1), (21.6 +/- 1.7) and (37.8 +/- 2.0) days, respectively, being no significant difference between group A and group C (P > 0.05). The survival time of group C was longer than that of group B (P < 0.01). And among group B, C and D, group D had the longest survival time (P < 0.01). GVHD signs and histologic changes were observed in 60% of control group mice at + 14 day, but none of group C and group D. 40% of mice in group A died of treatment associated morbidity within two weeks, but none in group C and group D. Allogeneic chimerism was kept in group A, but excluded gradually in group C.GVL effect seems preserved in nonmyeloablative BMT mice, but weaker than that in myeloablative BMT mice. GVL effect seems to be enhanced by DLI after nonmyeloablative BMT. GVHD and transplantation associated morbidity seems to be reduced in nonmyeloablative BMT.",

In this study, a urinary metabonomics method based on the NMR spectrometry was used to study the metabolic perturbation in CUMS-induced rat depression model. With pattern recognition analysis, a clear separation of CUMS rats and healthy controls was achieved, and nine endogenous metabolites contributing to the separation were identified. CUMS-treated rats were characterized by the increase of glycine, pyruvate, glutamine, and asparagines, as well as the decrease of 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, citrate, succinate, and acetate. The urinary biochemical changes related to the metabolic disturbance in CUMS induced depression, and the possible correlations with live qi stagnation in traditional Chinese medicine are discussed. The work shows that CUMS is a reliable model for studying depression, and the noninvasive urinary metabolomic method is a valuable tool to investigate the biochemical pertubations in depression as an early diagnostic means.",

        "abstract": "Three japonica photo-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile(PTGMS) lines G317S,G321S and G326S were marked with upmost pulvinus interval(UPI),i.e.,the length from the pulvinus of the 2nd leaf from the top to that of flag leaf,to record young panicle differentiation stages and a daily mean temperature of 20℃ was used as the low temperature to treat them in climatic chamber so that the effects of low temperature at different panicle differentiation stages were studied on fertility alteration of japonica PTGMS lines.The results showed that the pollen sterility of all three PTGMS lines was markedly decreased after the low temperature treatment(20℃ for three days) and their averaged bagged seed-setting percentage was as high as 66.41%,indicating a distinct fertility alteration under the low temperature stress.The fertility sensitive stage of the lines was found to be the developmental period with-4~4 cm of UPI.When the UPI was <-4 cm or >4 cm,the pollen sterility of the lines remained as high as over 99.95% without a significant decrease,indicating that the low temperature treatment at these developmental stages had no effect on fertility alteration.When the UPI was-4~-2 cm and 2~4 cm,the pollen sterility of spikelets at different panicle positions(the upper,middle or lower part of a panicle) did not vary much.However,when the UPI was-2~2 cm,the pollen sterility of spikelets at different panicle positions was greatly different with an order of the lower>the middle>the upper.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to detect the nerve growth factor (NGF) level in serum and NGF low affinity acceptor CD271 expression on bone marrow leukemic cells in acute B lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) patients and to analyze their clinical significance. The NGF level in serum and CD271 expression on leukemic cells in bone marrow were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry in B-ALL patients respectively. The results indicated that compared with control group, the NGF level in serum of patient group significantly increased (t = 4.191, p < 0.05), but CD271 expression on leukemic cells in bone marrow decreased significantly (t = 4.898, p < 0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate of 25 B-ALL patients was 64% (16/25) after one course of CVAD chemotherapy. There were statistically significant differences of NGF level and CD271 expression in non-remission (NR) group and control group (t = 3.976, p < 0.05 vs t = 5.052, p < 0.05), but there were no statistically difference of NGF level and CD271 expression in CR group (t = 1.102, p > 0.05 vs t = 1.150, p > 0.05) as compared with control group. The CD271 expression before and after chemotherapy between CR and NR groups showed statistically significant differences (t = 3.889, p < 0.05; t = 3.751, p < 0.05 and t = 4.678, p < 0.05 respectively), but NGF level before and after chemotherapy showed no statistical difference between these 2 groups (t = 0.476, p > 0.05). 50% (8/16) patients relapsed during following up, and of their NGF level [(168.00 ± 61.66) pg/ml] and CD271 expression [(52.29 ± 13.00)%] showed the significantly differences, compared with those in control group (t = 5.284, p < 0.05 vs. t = 6.073, p < 0.05), but the NGF level [(81.13 ± 25.32) pg/ml] and CD271 expression [(78.45 ± 7.12)%] of other 8 patients showed no statistical difference as compared with control group (t = 1.228, p > 0.05 vs t = 1.144, p > 0.05). Compared with low NGF level and CD271 low expression groups, the survival time of B-ALL patients with high NGF level and CD271 expression was not changed significantly (p = 0.750 vs p = 0.170). It is concluded that the increased NGF level in serum and decreased CD271 expression on bone marrow leukemic cells in B-ALL patients are related with leukemia development and may be the useful indexes to evaluate curative effect and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "The treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) with bortezomib (BTZ) is promising; however, the emergence of resistance is challenging in the clinical treatment. Thus, a novel targeted treatment or exploring the mechanism underlying BTZ resistance is an urgent requisite. The current data showed that high expression of USP7 in myeloma was a predictor of short overall survival and poor outcome. USP7 knockout significantly suppressed the colony formation, inhibited the proliferation of BTZ-resistant MM cells even in the presence of growth factors, and overcame BTZ resistance. The knockout markedly inhibited the tumor growth and prolonged the survival of mice bearing BTZ-resistant MM cells. Mechanistically, USP7 knockout remarkably increased the sensitivity to BTZ by stabilizing ΙκΒα and blocking the NF-κB pathway. Not surprisingly, when IκBα was knocked down by siRNA transfection, the MM cells restored the BTZ resistance. Importantly, usage of USP7 inhibitors also suppressed the activation of NF-κB and combination with BTZ triggered the synergistic antitumor activity in BTZ-resistant MM cells. Taken together, this study provides the rationale for clinical protocols evaluating USP7 inhibition, alone and in combination with BTZ, to overcome BTZ resistance and improve the patient outcome in MM.",

        "abstract": "To observe the efficacy of high-dose dexamethasone in combination with low-dose rituximab as a second-line treatment for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).65 patients with ITP, previously by conventional dose of glucocorticoids, received high-dose dexamethasone in combination with low-dose rituximab (dexamethasone 40 mg/d for 4 days, rituximab 100 mg, d 7, 14, 21, 28 intravenous infusion). Treatment response, regulatory T cells (Treg), cytokines levels and treatment-related adverse effects were observed.Total response rate 1 month after treatment was achieved in 81.5% (53/65) of patients, and complete response at 3,6 and 12 months was 72.3% (47/65), 66.2%(43/65), 63.1%(41/65). The higher efficiency and complete response rate was achieved in preexisting glucocorticoid-dependent patients. For patients with complete response, Treg cells continued to show a high level state [(3.01 ± 0.95)% vs (1.69 ± 0.35)%, P=0.032], cytokines of BAFF [(648.03 ± 79.63) ng/L vs (972.35 ± 93.64) ng/L, P=0.001], IL-2 [(2.84 ± 0.32) ng/L vs (4.18 ± 0.46) ng/L, P=0.012], sCD40L[(4.55 ± 0.66) ng/L vs (7.73 ± 1.04) ng/L, P=0.006] significantly lower than that before treatment. The level of IL-10 was increased, but without significance compared with that before treatment (P=0.136). All patients completed the protocol with no serious adverse reactions.The data show high-dose dexamethasone in combination with low-dose rituximab still has a satisfactory outcomes for patients previously with conventional dose of glucocorticoid.",

In this paper, the surface pollution deposit law of DC insulator shed, the influence of rainfall on pollution deposit (equivalent salt deposit density, ESDD) and non-soluble deposit density (NSDD), unevenness of pollution between top and bottom surface, dust to salt ratio of insulator surface, the orthogonal ratio of ESDD to NSDD and so on are analyzed. Research results show that not all rainfall achieves obvious purging efficiency on pollution deposited on insulator surface; both the amount of precipitation and rainfall intensity are important factors influencing purging effect; the maximum pollution degree of polymeric insulator occurs before rainy season in the summer, but not before spring rain. It is recommended that these features of pollution deposit should be adequately considered in the DC outdoor insulation design.",

        "abstract": "Interaction between graphene and semiconducting diamond substrate has been examined with large-scale density functional theory calculations. Clean and hydrogenated diamond (100) and (111) surfaces have been studied. It turns out that weak van der Waals interactions dominate for graphene on all these surfaces. High carrier mobility of graphene is almost not affected, except for a negligible energy gap opening at the Dirac point. No charge transfer between graphene and diamond (100) surfaces is detected, while different charge-transfer complexes are formed between graphene and diamond (111) surfaces, inducing either p-type or n-type doping on graphene. Therefore, diamond can be used as an excellent substrate of graphene, which almost keeps its electronic structures at the same time providing the flexibility of charge doping.",
