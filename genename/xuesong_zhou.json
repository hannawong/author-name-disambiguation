Xanthan gum, sodium alginate and gellan gum all could increase the moisture content which reached the maximum value when the dosage of sodium alginate was 0.15%. Adding 0.10% sodium alginate could lower the water activity significantly. The texture test showed that adding 0.10% xanthan gum or 0.05% sodium alginate could delay the aging of cake. The microbiological examination showed that sodium alginate could decrease the water activity of the cake, and restrain the growth of mildew.

Results of this research show that the reactive power absorbed by wind farm restricts the injecting ability of active power; higher voltage reference and amplification factor of SVC contribute to increase active power output of wind farm, and then the instability due to voltage oscillation can be avoided; there is a certain complementarity between voltage reference and amplification factor, and their combined action contribute to delay Hopf bifurcation and improve voltage stability of wind power system.",

The results indicated that two phosphate cross-linking hydroxypropylated waxy corn starches with low cross linking degree were unsuitable to HRFJ because of their inferior heat-resisting quality. Another two phosphate cross-linking hydroxypropylated waxy corn starches and two adipic acid cross-linking acetic acid esterified waxy corn starches could improve the heat- resisting and the water retention of HRFJ, endowing the products with good texture and taste. Among these modified starch, phosphate cross-linking hydroxypropylated waxy corn starch CR3010 with high cross linking degree showed good thermostability and acid-resistant properties.

The FT-IR spectra showed that phosphorus-containing groups were introduced into the polyol chain. The data of the viscosity and the hydroxyl number suggested that the bio-polyol phosphonate would be a good polyol component in the preparation of polyurethane foam. The limiting oxygen index of polyurethane foam containing bio-polyol phosphonate varied in the range of 24-28, while that of polyurethane foam without bio-polyol phosphonate was 23, demonstrating that the introduction of the phosphorus-containing group into the polymer helped to improve the flame retardancy. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Effects of solution concentration, molecular weight of lignin, and addition of polymer on the morphology and diameter of nanofibers were systematically investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The morphology of nanofibers changed with the changing of solution concentration and polymer molecular weight. Fibrous structure could be stabilized when the solution concentrations of high molecular weight (LH), medium molecular weight (LM) and low molecular weight (LL) were higher than 30 wt.%, 35 wt.% and 40 wt.%, respectively. Fiber diameter increased with the increase of solution concentration and lignin molecular weight. The addition of polymer, e. g. cellulose acetate (CA), resulted in the reduction of beads.",

The modified PBO fibers were characterized through scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and BET. The influence of treating time and treating temperature of the surface treatments with chemical reagents on the morphology of PBO Fibers was studied. The results showed that the optimal effect of etching could be obtained by using 1.0% etching solution S for three minutes, the smooth skins of the PBO fibers were peeled off and exfoliated along the core. The surface morphology of the fibers changed greatly after swelling with the swelling agent K solution and beating. The surface of PBO fibers became rough and with microfibril structure. Meanwhile, the specific surface area of PBO fibers increased greatly, from the original 0.73 m2/g increased to 10.88 m2/g. It demonstrated that the increase of the roughness and the interfacial areas between fibers would enhance the strength of interlacement.",

On the basis of this treatment,quadratic polynomial is considered as approximate analytical expression of saddle node bifurcation boundaries in wind power system parameter space. At last,by simulation of an example, the high precision and effectiveness of the method to approach true border is tested and verified. With the help of this method, problem of bifurcation parameter space dimension constraints can be easily solved by multi-parameter bifurcation studies of wind power system. A mathematical description of the bifurcation boundary is more conducive to determine the conditions under which saddle node bifurcation of wind power system occurs at deeper level.

Bifurcation theory includes both static and dynamic bifurcation. Static bifurcation study is the primary task of bifurcation theory. The bifurcation study can analyze the impact of dynamic control performance on voltage stability especially for flexible AC system(FACTS) such as static synchronous compensator(STATCOM) and static var compensator (SVC). The reactive power compensation effect of STATCOM is better than SVC. In this paper, a kind of toolbox of MATLAB, PSAT, is used for the comparative static bifurcation analysis for power system with and without STATCOM, and the bifurcation value on the point is studied. The studied results show that STATCOM can add load limit and delay static bifurcation to improve voltage stability. © 2011 IEEE.",

The results from FTIR and TGA indicated that the network indeed existed in the SIPN hydrogels. The data from experiments, those related to the swelling behavior of the hydrogels at different temperatures in particular, demonstrated the thermal sensitivity of these hydrogels. The impact of crosslinker content on the hydrogel properties was discussed as well. The swelling ratio of hydrogels decreased with increasing the content of MBAAm. Besides, the loading and releasing behavior of the hydrogels were examined using dimethyl methylene blue as a model drug. These novel hydrogels combining the advantages of natural polymer with thermal responsive behavior are of great potential to be applied to drug delivery and control release systems.",

        "abstract": "The condition of thermal power plant of some SINOPEC is simply introduced first, after choosing its receiving operation, enterprise internal power's dynamic frequency characteristic mechanism has been analyzed under external fault condition, and then arriving at a conclusion that the dynamic frequency characteristic has something to do with active power shortage and frequency adjustment effect modulus of load. At last, having selected the reasonable failure mode and mathematical models in software PSASP7.0 to simulate this dynamic frequency characteristics curve of the system, we can verify the validity of the conclusion. The above is good for revealing the weak link of the plant in future and laying the foundation for finding the way to improve the reliability of the system. At the same time, it also has some reference value for other enterprise grid.",

The influences of the LM content on the hydrogel properties were investigated in terms of their lower critical solution temperature (LCST), interior morphology, temperature response kinetic, swelling and deswelling kinetics. The swelling ratio of the hydrogels at different temperature showed that these new smart hydrogels were responsive to the changes of external temperature. The DSC data demonstrated that the LCST of the hydrogels reduced with the increased content of LM in the hydrogels. The SEM images showed that increasing LM content resulted in the reduced pore size of the hydrogel. The swelling and deswelling behavior stated that the hydrogel with less LM content exhibited better temperature sensitivity.",

In order to reduce the net stability impact of the grid. The wind farm power controller based on superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is presented. Based on SMES’s four-quadrant power operation capability and millisecond response speed, fluctuations in the active and reactive power of a wind farm are compensated, so that grid power reaches constant. At last, the validity and feasibility of power controlling instrument is validated by simulation with matlab / simulink.",

        "abstract": "The influences of ultrasonic pretreatment on the morphology and liquefaction behavior of bagasse were studied. SEM images showed that the fiber surface of bagasse became less compact and the cell wall was broken severely after sonication. The FT-IR spectra of bagasse, however, showed that no significant change of chemical structure occurred after sonication. These increase the accessibility of the bagasse liber, accelerate the liquefaction, decrease the coupling of the free radicals derived from the liquefaction intermediates, which are in favor of liquefaction. The impacts of the sonication time, the frequency and the power of ultrasound on the morphology and liquefaction behavior of bagasse were investigated. The result showed that suitable frequency for the treatment is 28 kHz. Both prolonging the time of sonication and increasing the power of ultrasound reduce the residue rate of the liquefaction. The liquefaction process is also accelerated after sonication. The relative molecular weight distribution of the liquefaction product, however, has little change after the ultrasonic pretreatment, indicating that the liquefaction mechanism is not changed by sonication.",

The solar array should be integrated with a dc-dc converter and a control algorithm to perform a search to track the maximum power continuously. We adopt perturbation and observation method to implement Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for solar cells. Owing to the existence of converters, photovoltaic system is a hybrid system contains continuous dynamic and discrete dynamic. Traditionally, the power electronic converter is difficult to model. This paper illustrates the modeling method of hybrid system, especially finite automata model. Based on Finite State Machine (FSM), the hybrid modeling of boost converter is presented. Finally, provides a simulation environment for such combination between continuous time system and finite automata, which employs the simulink and stateflow from Matlab.",

The lignin-based macromer was synthesized by substituting the hydroxyl groups in acetic acid lignin with acryloyl chloride. This macromer then reacted with N-isopropylacrylamide to form hydrogels via photocrosslinking. The hydrogels were investigated in terms of their swelling behavior, thermal behavior, and interior morphology. The results clearly showed that these newly synthesized hydrogels were sensitive to the changes of temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves demonstrated that the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogels was reduced with an increase in the weight ratio of macromer/N-isopropylacrylamide. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) showed that all hydrogels had porous network structures and that the pore sizes were dependent on the weight ratio of macromer/N-isopropylacrylamide. The deswelling data indicated that the hydrogels with less macromer content were more sensitive to the changes of temperature. Copyright © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",

The quadratic polynomial is taken as the approximate nonlinear analytical expression of saddle node bifurcation boundaries in the parameter space of wind power system. Simulative results of an example show the precision and effectiveness of the proposed method in approaching the true border.",

The results showed that the vinyl-siloxane and acrylate monomers were well copolymerized in the preparation of the emulsion and the particles exhibited an obvious core-shell structure. Furthermore, the initial thermal decomposition temperature of the copolymers increasesd significantly with the increase of the the vinyl-siloxane monomer dosage, and the thermal stability of the copolymers were improved obviously.

SEM, XPS and droplet profile method were then respectively used to determine the surface morphology, the composition and the contact angle of PBO fibers before and after the treatment. Moreover, the interfacial shearing strengths between PBO fiber and epoxy resin before and after the treatment were finally measured by the single-fiber pull-out test. It is found that the surface hydrophilicity of PBO fiber and the interfacial shearing strength between PBO fiber and epoxy resin are greatly improved after the modification, and that, in the conditions of 2% (mass fraction) of coupling agent, 2 min of treatment period, 30 W of power and 50 Pa of pressure, the contact angle between the fiber and water reduces from original more than 90° to 54.5°, and the corresponding interfacial shearing strength rises to 10.44MPa, increasing by 78%. Furthermore, both the interfacial shearing strength and the water hydrophilicity of PBO fiber are kept from becoming vestigial after the modification as time progresses.",

Thereby, the carrier phase-shifted modulation technology was used in the cascaded multilvevel inverter. A 5 MVA uncoupled transformer 11-level cascaded DVR was researched for the 6 kV power system. The double loop control strategy was designed which employed a slow outer voltage loop and a fast inner current loop. Voltage sag was simulated at a random time when multi-level DVR was under the control of any control strategy. Results show that the DVR based on voltage shifted pulse width modulation technology can greatly increase the inverter switching frequency and decrease the harmonic distortion and variation rate of voltage, and the system damping ratio and stability and error can be regulated by adjusting relevant parameters. The application of this technology can greatly enhance the performance indicators of DVR and has a high practical value.",

An improved 'abc-dq' transaction detection algorithm which can detect the system voltage amplitude and phase accurately and rapidly is used in the system, and the minimal voltage compensation strategy is adopted to compensate voltage drop. The simulation results by the Matlab/Simulink software show that, the 11-level cascaded H-bridge transformer-less DVR based on voltage shifted pulse width modulation technology can greatly increase the inverter switching frequency, and decrease the harmonic distortion and voltage rate of change, thereby it fully meets the high quality requirements of voltage. The application of this technology can greatly enhance the performance indicators of DVR and has a high practical value.",

Several indexes that characterize the impacts of wind power injection to voltage stability and losses of the power system are proposed for the first time (active power loss per unit ηP , reactive power loss per unit ηQ , and voltage offset per units ΔV P ). Research result shows that reactive power compensation can delay or suppress the occurrence of saddle-node bifurcation, but it can not completely make up for negative roles of continually increasing of wind power injection; through quantitative analysis of roles reactive power compensation to reducing of losses and improving of voltage stability, the effectiveness of the proposed indexes were proved.

First of all, the eigen-polynomial of Jacobian matrix of the system can be decomposed into product of two parts under the condition for existing of Hopf bifurcation. And then, the coefficients of the eigen-polynomial can be decided though the semi-analytical method by using the relations of the coefficients and the elements of Jacobian matrix, and deducing the conditions which should be decided by the coefficients at Hopf bifurcation point. The nonlinear equation set is constructed through the above condition and the one that Hopf bifurcation point must be the balance point of the system. The nonlinear equation set is constructed through the above condition and the one that Hopf bifurcation point must be the balance point of the system. And last, the nonlinear equation set is solved by using Newton2Raphson iterative method. The proposed method can determine both Hopf bifurcation point and the pure imaginary eigenvalue pair of the Jacobin matrix of the system at the same time, thus avoiding the shortcoming for repeatedly solving the eigenvalue problems for every change of the chosen parameters as in some other existing methods. The proposed method is feasible and effective which is illustrated in General Electric Power Systems. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",

From the results, it was suggested that the mechanical properties of the papers could be improved more effectively by reinforced with the core-shell latex than with the random structural latex synthesized by the traditional emulsion polymerization. Furthermore, the core-shell emulsions endowed the papers with a good water/oil resistance. The distribution of the emulsion resin in the paper was observed by the method of SEM.",

        "abstract": "Partial shading (PS) is an unavoidable condition which significantly reduces the efficiency and stability of a photovoltaic (PV) system. With PS, the system usually exhibits multiple-peak output power characteristics, but single-peak is also possible under special PS conditions. In fact it is shown that the partial shading condition (PSC) is the necessary but not sufficient condition for multiple-peak. Based on circuit analysis, this paper shows that the number of peak points can be determined by short-circuit currents and maximum-power point currents of all the arrays in series. Then the principle is established based on which the number of the peak points is to be determined. Furthermore, based on the dynamic characteristic of solar array, this paper establishes the rule for determination of the relative position of the global maximum power point (GMPP). In order to track the GMPP within an appropriate period, a reliable technique and the corresponding computer algorithm are developed for GMPP tracking (GMPPT) control. It exploits a definable nonlinear relation has been found between variable environmental parameters and the output current of solar arrays at every maximum power point, obtained based on the dynamic performance corresponding to PSC. Finally, the proposed method is validated with MATLAB ® /Simulink ® simulations and actual experiments. It is shown that the GMPPT of a PV generation system is indeed realized efficiently in a realistic environment with partial shading conditions.",

Blends of poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) and lignin were prepared from these lignin fractions. The influences of lignin on the processabilities of the blends, as well as on their mechanical performances and thermal properties, were investigated. The lignin fraction with low molecular weight accelerates the plasticization of blend. It can be dispersed in a rather uniformly form in PVC matrix than any other fractions. The blend prepared from low-molecular-weight lignin fraction exhibits higher mechanical performances than those of blends prepared from any other fractions. The initial decomposition temperature of blends shows a slight decrease, while the incorporation of high-molecular-weight lignin fraction improves the maximum decomposition temperature of blend. The heterogeneity of soda lignin results in the deteriorated mechanical performances of the blend prepared from un-fractionated lignin. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

Results showed that the beating of plant fibres had remarkable influence on porosity, interfacial adhesion and filler retention. The plant fibres with low beating degree had no impact on the porosity of materials, but could significantly improve the interfacial adhesion and filler retention as compared with the sample without beating, which resulted in higher friction coefficient and lower abrasion. However, in the case of high beating degree, low porosity would lead to poorer heat diffusion from the work area, which gave rise to low friction coefficient and higher abrasion of the material.",

The effects of AAL/polyacrylate ratio,concentration and operational conditions(voltage,feed rate,and spinneret-collector distance) ,on the structure and diameter of electrospun nanobers,were systematically investigated in this work. The results show that with the increase of AAL/polyacrylate ratio,spindles are formed and broken fibers appear. In addition,the concentration has a clear influences on both fiber diameter and structure. With the increase of concentration,the fiber becomes smooth from bead structure,the average diameter increases gradually. Voltage has a little effect on the diameter,with increase of voltage,bead structure disappearing;fiber diameter increased with increase of feed rate;with the increase of spinneret-collector distance,the fiber diameter decreases but bead structure appears.",

Finally the soluble polyimide(PI) with benzoxazole branched chain was synthesized by twostep method. The PI’s structure, thermal characteristics and solubility in various solvent were analyzed respectively by FT-IR, DSC, TGA and other testing methods. The experiment results showed that the polyamide acid could more fully translate into imide after heat treatment at 300 ℃ for 1 h. The PI’s thermal stability was improved when the benzoxazole with branched chain was introduced, its glass transition temperature(Tg) was about 300 ℃, and initial thermal decomposition temperature was 552.5 ℃. The PI which had better processing performance could still keep better solvent resistance for common solvent because the PI’s solubility was better in strong polar solvent, but PI can’t dissolve in common polar solvent.",

For this reason, the voltage stability of micro-grid with CSAWT will be seriously affected by the wind speed. In view of this phenomenon, the influence on operating condition and impedance characteristic for voltage stability was researched theoretically based on power-voltage characteristics. The STATCOM/SMES control structure was proposed based on active power, reactive power decoupling control strategy, as well as EXPMA was taken as the active power control signal. The structure can smooth wind generator power output effectively and improve voltage stability of system. The simulation analysis shows the validity of the proposed control structure and strategy.",

With the help of ideas and methods calculating the two-dimensional parameter bifurcation boundary in conventional electric power system, the node voltage two-dimensional saddle-node bifurcation boundary of wind power system was calculated by using wind farm active power injection (Pinject), SVC parameters Bmax and Kr as bifurcation control parameters. And on the basis of this in-depth analysis, the laws that the parameters affecting the wind power system voltage stability were obtained. It is as follows: The wind farm terminal voltage stability (that is, compensation point) is improved by the effect of both SVC parameters (such as Bmax or Kr) and wind power injection; It is equally effective in the expansion of saddle-node bifurcation boundary by increasing SVC parameters Bmax and Kr, but the role of Bmax is more significant. © 2010 Chin.

        "abstract": "Lignin with low molecular weight (LA), fractionated from soda lignin by methanol extraction, was grafted with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and used for interfacial modification for poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC)/wood flour composites. By sequential extraction with chloroform and aqueous NaOH solution, the grafting product was separated into three fractions by the different solubility of various components in these solvents. The data of lignin contents in the three fractions indicate that more than 80% of the lignin participated in the copolymerization. As indicated by the contact angle, data the hydrophilic wood surface was transformed into a hydrophobic one by the grafting product treatment. The grafting product exhibited a positive influence on improving the mechanical performances of PVC/wood flour composites. In comparison with untreated ones, the tensile and impact strengths of composites containing 30 phr of wood flour treated with 2 wt% grafting product (MMA/LA = 1:1) were increased by 18.7% and 25.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the optimum ratio of MMA/LA was 2:1, for which the increments in tensile and impact strengths were 20.9% and 35.3%, respectively. A significant increase in storage modulus (E) was observed upon the incorporation of treated wood flour. SEM (scanning electron microscope) images showed that the dispersion of treated wood flour in the polymer matrix was improved. It can be inferred that the polymer-wood interfacial bonding was strengthened. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",

The only way to solve them is to find some new fashion energy to fulfill the consumption. So the only thing which can take the place of fossil fuel is renewable energy. There are three kinds of renewable energy which are hot in researching: wind power, photovoltaic power, and tidal power. But all of them are intermittent energy, if we settle the voltage, the power outputs would be hard to forecast and control. This caused a lot of problem for example: the quality of the power and harmonic problems.

Among problems related with the power quality, the most urgent is the voltage dip; with the application of power electronics devices, the power system is polluted by harmonics. SMES (Superconducting Magnet Energy Storage) system can not only compensate the voltage dip, but also provide a load-fluctuation compensation and active power filter. In the paper the main structure of SMES system is introduced; the necessity to use SMES are demonstrated by analyzing the problem of power quality. The analysis shows that SMES system is effective in improving the power quality. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

The topology of DVR main circuit basically adopts two-level or three-level structure and makes use of series injecting transformer as injection mode, which has some problems and shortfalls in practical use. The cascade multilevel transformer-less topological DVR can solve these problems effectively. The improved detecting algorithm based on 'abc-dq' transaction is precise and fast. According to the different sensitivities of different loads to the phase angle jump of voltage sag, different compensating voltage waveforms and different control strategies are applied. The energy steady control strategy integrates the advantages of other control strategies and avoids the demerits, optimizes the energy exchange process between DVR and the power system, reduces the equipment's capacity required by DVR, and increases the effective compensating time. Meanwhile, the danger to security from the over-voltage at DC side caused by the absorbed energy of DVR during the rising of system voltage can be avoided so as to improve the economy and reliability.",

This kind of method takes the elements of the filter frequency characteristics and the system power factor into consideration. The simulation results proves that the filter parameters which chosen by this method can meet the various requirements of the system . The desired effect of filtering is achieved. For the different power factor loads, this filter have the ability to get an ideal filtering effect and to improve the system's power factor.",

Through analyzing the energy spectrogram in the signal high-frequency band of distortion excitation current and short circuit current are determined.

        "abstract": "From the engineering cybernetics perspective, determining the output voltage of a solar cell corresponding to the maximum power point (MPP) under variable temperature and irradiation conditions is essential for tracking the maximum power point. However, conventional methods could not effectively achieve this goal, and approaches for utilizing this information do not exist, including the output voltage and duty cycle at MPP, in the control process. This paper describes a novel method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control in parameter optimization corresponding to variable environmental conditions. The results show a definable nonlinear relation between variable environmental parameters and the output voltage of a solar cell at MPP both theoretically and experimentally. Additionally, this research gives the mathematical expression for it. Then, MPPT control rules are created based on the findings from a nonlinear relation that can respond at high speeds to variations in irradiation and the temperature of a solar cell. In view of this relationship, we found that the output voltage at MPP is robust to irradiance in a certain range, and this directs the choices of irradiance in experiments. Therefore, MATLAB®/Simulink® numerical simulations are presented to illustrate that this control algorithm can implement the MPP of a PV generation system efficiently even in the low solar irradiation condition.",

Therefore, due to the wind power system is a typical large-scale complex non-linear system, so that chaotic phenomena will also occur under certain conditions and chaos will influence the stable operation of the wind power system, so the chaotic research are particularly important along with the fast development of grid-connected wind power technology [3-6]. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

        "abstract": "This paper constructs a new four-dimensional autonomous hyperchaotic system with complex dynamic behaviors, and its boundary is estimated based on the proposed method and the optimization idea. Inspired by the “parallel universe theory,” a trigonometric function is used to do coordinate transformation of the original new system to generate any number of attractors. Simulation results show that there are infinite equilibriums in the transformed system. Compared with the original new system, the transformed system is more sensitive to the initial values. Based on the estimated boundary of the original system, the boundary of transformed system could be obtained. To verify the existence of chaos of the transformed system, the topology horseshoe of the system is investigated. The positive topological entropy of the transformed system verifies the existence of hyperchaos. Furthermore, selecting proper parameter values, the transformed system shows a multi-scroll attractor. Applying multi-variable trigonometric transformation can also induce any number of attractors and multi-scroll phenomenon in multi-dimension, which is an interesting phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Lignin with low molecular weight (LA), fractionated from soda lignin by methanol extraction, was grafted with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and used for interfacial modification for poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC)/wood flour composites. By sequential extraction with chloroform and aqueous NaOH solution, the grafting product was separated into three fractions by the different solubility of various components in these solvents. The data of lignin contents in three fractions indicate that more than 80% of the lignin participated in the copolymerization. The hydrophilic wood surface was transformed into a hydrophobic one by the grafting product treatment. The grafting product exhibited a positive influence on improving the mechanical performances of PVC/wood composites. In comparison with untreated ones, the tensile and impact strengths of composites containing 30 phr of wood flour treated with 2wt% grafting product (MMA/LA =2:1) were increased by 20.9% and 35.3%, respectively. A significant increase in storage modulus (E′) was observed upon the incorporation of treated wood flour. SEM images showed that the dispersion of treated wood flour in the polymer matrix was improved. It can be inferred that the polymer-wood interfacial bonding was strengthened.",

The stability of SHAPF with first-order LADRC is analyzed by Lyapunov stability analysis and analysis result shows that the control system is asymptotically stable and is stable in engineering practice. Applying the proposed first-order LADRC to current tracking link of SHAPF in a certain 10kV transmission line to perform the simulation, simulation results show that the LADRC can cope with the contradiction between overshooting and rapidity effectively, and the performance of the LADRC is better than that of traditional PI controller, thus the effectiveness of linear auto disturbance rejection control strategy is verified.",

In view of difficulty in random signal selection and realization of random frequency pulse width modulation (RFPWM) being used to DSTATCOM, This article put forward a kind of new RFPWM based on Chebychev chaotic sequence. At the same time, extended states observer (ESO) in LADRC can provide the estimate of the real action of the system internal (including the unmeasured and coupled state) and external unknown disturbances, and thus it realized d, q axis current decoupling of linear active disturbance rejection control.

The simulation results showed that the new system not only decreased harmonic amplitude but professed better rapidity and robustness. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.",
