At MCC we have built a prototype object-oriented database system, called ORION. It adds persistence and sharability to objects created and manipulated in applications implemented in an object-oriented programming environment. One of the important requirements of these applications is schema evolution, that is, the ability to dynamically make a wide variety of changes to the database schema. In this paper, following a brief review of the object-oriented data model that we support in ORION, we establish a framework for supporting schema evolution, define the semantics of schema evolution, and discuss its implementation.",

        "abstract": "There are two major issues to address to achieve integration of an object-oriented programming system with a database system. One is the language issue: an object-oriented programming language must be augmented with semantic data modeling concepts to provide a robust set of data modeling concepts to allow modeling of entities for important real-world applications. Another is the computational-model issue: application programmers should be able to access and manipulate objects as though the objects are in an infinite virtual memory; in other words, they should not have to be aware of the existence of a database system in their computations with the data structures the programming language allows. This paper discusses these issues and presents the solutions which we have incorporated into the ORION object-oriented database system at MCC.",

        "abstract": "In object-oriented systems, an object may recursively reference any number of other objects. The references, however, do not capture any special relationships between objects. An important semantic relationship which may be superimposed on a reference is the IS-PART-OF relationship between a pair of objects. A set of objects related by the IS-PART-OF relationship is collectively called a composite object.An earlier paper [KIM87b] presented a model of composite objects which has been implemented in the ORION object-oriented database system at MCC. Although the composite-object feature has been found quite useful, the model suffers from a number of serious shortcomings, primarily because it overloads a number of orthogonal semantics on the references. In this paper, first we present a more general model of composite objects which does not suffer from these shortcomings. Further, [KIM87b] made an important contribution by exploring the use of composite objects as a unit for versions, physical clustering, and concurrency control. The extended model of composite objects necessitates non-trivial changes to the results of [KIM87b]. This paper describes the new results on the use of composite objects as a unit of not only versions, physical clustering and concurrency control, but also authorization.",

ORION supports a concurrency control mechanism based on extensions to the current theory of locking, and a transaction recovery mechanism based on conventional logging.",

The ORION data model consolidates and modifies a number of major concepts found in many object-oriented systems, such as objects, classes, class lattice, methods, and inheritance. These concepts are reviewed and three major enhancements to the conventional object-oriented data model, namely, schema evolution, composite objects, and versions, are elaborated upon. Schema evolution is the ability to dynamically make changes to the class definitions and the structure of the class lattice. Composite objects are recursive collections of exclusive components that are treated as units of storage, retrieval, and integrity enforcement. Versions are variations of the same object that are related by the history of their derivation. These enhancements are strongly motivated by the data management requirements of the ORION applications from the domains of artificial intelligence, computer-aided design and manufacturing, and office information systems with multimedia documents.",

Further, it can be used as a unit of storage and retrieval to enhance the performance of a database system.This paper provides a formal definition of the semantics of composite objects within an object-oriented data model, and describes their use as units of integrity control, storage and retrieval, and concurrency control in a prototype object-oriented database system we have implemented.",

The ORION query model is based on the ORION object-oriented data model. Further, we have adopted the response time as the primary objective function for query optimization. The query-processing strategies we have developed reflect our solutions to these requirements. In particular, our strategies are based on a dataflow execution model which represents a plan for executing a query concurrently at multiple sites. One important observation we bring out in our description of the ORION query-processing strategies is that most of the important techniques developed for optimizing and processing a relational query apply directly to an object-oriented query, despite the differences in the underlying data models.",

However, these models are not adequate for next-generation database systems that support richer data models that include object-oriented concepts and semantic data modeling concepts. Rabitti, Woelk, and Kim [14] presented a preliminary model of authorization for use as the basis of an authorization mechanism in such database systems. In this paper we present a fuller model of authorization that fills a few major gaps that the conventional models of authorization cannot fill for next-generation database systems. We also further formalize the notion of implicit authorization and refine the application of the notion of implicit authorization to object-oriented and semantic modeling concepts. We also describe a user interface for using the model of authorization and consider key issues in implementing the authorization model.",

One major architectural innovation in ORION-2 is the coexistence of a shared databese and a number of private databases. The shared database is accessible to all authorized users of the system, while each private database is accessible to only the user who owns it. A distributed database system with a shared database and private databases for individual users is a natural architecture for data-intensive application environments on a network of workstations, notably computer-aided design and engineering systems. This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of such a system and explores the impact of such an architecture on the semantics and implementation of some of the key functions of a database system, notably queries, database schema, and versions. Although the issues are discussed in the context of an object-oriented data model, the results (at least significant portions thereof) are applicable to database systems supporting other data models.",

It shows the capabilities of an object-based data model and indicates extensions which are needed to meet the data modelling aspects of these requirements. A logical implementation of the operations on the model is described. The model generalizes the notions of instantiation and generalization in the standard object-oriented paradigm, and augments it with the notions of aggregation and relationships which are specialized for a multimedia application environment. Objects may exist in aggregation hierarchies which provide the capability to integrate diverse types of multimedia information such as text, sound, bit-mapped images, and complex graphics drawings. Objects may also be linked through other user-defined relationships to capture such application functions as voice annotation and referencing of one document by another. Using this model, the semantics of aggregation and relationships in a multimedia application environment can be understood and efficiently supported by a database system.",

The object subsystem provides high-level data management functions, including query optimization, schema management, long data management (including text search) and support for versionable objects, composite objects, and multimedia objects. The transaction management subsystem coordinates concurrent object accesses and provides recovery capabilities. The storage subsystem manages persistent storage of objects and controls the flow of objects between the secondary storage device and main memory buffers. In ORION-1, all subsystems reside in one computer. The ORION-1SX architecture is significantly different from ORION-1 in the management of shared data structures and distribution of these subsystems and their components.",

        "abstract": "Background : Vascular and inflammatory processes have been reported to be factors in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) plays essential roles in regulating vascular growth, development, maturation, permeability, and inflammation. Objective : The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)-Ang1, which is a soluble, stable, potent Ang1 variant, on peripheral nerves in db/db diabetic mice. Methods : The db/db diabetic mice were randomized into 2 groups based on their weight and glucose level and treated with recombinant adenovirus (Ade), expressing either COMP-Ang1 or the \u03b2-galactosidase gene (LacZ) (control), for 8 weeks. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a polyclonal antibody of antiprotein gene product and a secondary antibody. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was quantified as nerve fiber abundance per unit length of epidermis (IENF/mm). In addition, the total capillary length (TCL) per unit length of epidermis was summed (mm/mm 2 ). All slides were coded and the capillary length and the number of nerve fibers were calculated by a blinded observer. Results : Ten diabetic db/db mice (mean [SD] weight, 38.7 [1.95] g) were randomized to receive Ade-COMP-Ang1 or Ade-LacZ. IENFD was significantly greater in the Ade-COMP-Ang1 group compared with the Ade-LacZ group (mean [SD] 8.95 [3.30] vs 3.57 [0.73]/mm; P < 0.05). TCL was also significantly greater in the Ade-COMP-Ang1 group (2.79 [0.99] vs 2.04 [0.58] mm/mm 2 ; P < 0.05). Compared with baseline, fasting blood glucose concentration after 8 weeks of treatment decreased significantly more in the Ade-COMP-Ang1 group than in the Ade-LacZ group (489 [45] to 361 [81] vs 495 [48] to 521 [70] mg/dL; P < 0.05). Conclusions : These results suggest that Ade-COMP-Ang1 might have had proliferative effects on peripheral nerve and cutaneous capillaries in this small animal study. Further investigation of the metabolic effect, target site, and related mediator of COMP-Ang1 is needed.",

        "abstract": "Background. Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-g may help to regulate inflammation by modulating the production of inflammatory medi- ators and adhesion molecules. The purpose of this study was to determine the protective effects of rosiglitazone on renal injury in a sepsis model and to explore the mechanism. Methods. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse sepsis, we examined the effect of rosiglitazone on LPS- induced overproduction of inflammatory mediators, on the expression of adhesion molecules in renal tubular epithelial cells and on renal function. The mechanism of the protective effect was investigated in vitro using human renal tubular epithelial cells. Results. Rosiglitazone significantly decreased serum tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)- 1b levels during sepsis. The levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were significantly lower in mice pre-treated with rosiglitazone than that in LPS-treated mice. Rosiglitazone reduced the expression of inter- cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in tubular epi- thelial cells and interstitium of LPS-treated mice. Pre-treatment with rosiglitazone reduced the infiltra- tion of macrophages/monocytes in renal tissue. In cul- tured tubular epithelial cells, rosiglitazone significantly decreased the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 induced by TNF-a or IL-1b, inhibited the degradation of inhibitor kBa (IkBa) and blocked the activation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kB. Conclusions. These results indicate that pre-treatment with rosiglitazone attenuated the production of TNF-a and IL-1b and reduced adhesion molecule expression in renal tubular epithelial cells of LPS-treated mice. Rosiglitazone has an anti-inflammatory effect in renal tubular epithelial cells through the inhibition of NF-kB activation.",

Fractalkine is a unique chemokine that functions as a chemoattractant and an adhesion molecule on endothelial cells activated by proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated the effects of genistein (5-25 muM) on fractalkine expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and on its receptor, CX3CR1, in THP-1 cells in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha. TNF-alpha significantly induced fractalkine expression in endothelial cells. Genistein decreased TNF-alpha-induced fractalkine expression through suppression of Akt and p38 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activities. Genistein also strongly suppressed TNF-alpha-induced expression of CX3CR1 in monocytes. Genistein suppressed TNF-alpha-stimulated adhesion of monocytes to HUVECs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that genistein suppressed the in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced arterial endothelial fractalkine expression in the heart, kidney, and small intestine.

DNA synthetic activity was measured using [(3)H]-thymidine autoradiogram in the kidney sections. Cyclin, CDK, and CKI proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. CDK activities were determined by phosphorylation amount using specific substrate. The protein levels of cyclins (D1, D3, E, A) and activities of CDK4 and CDK2 were increased concomitant with the induction of DNA synthetic activity in outer medullae, but not in glomeruli, in adult kidneys during DNA synthetic period after ischemic injury. The p27(KIP1) protein, but not the p21(CIP1) protein, increased equally in total kidney, glomeruli, and outer medullae after ischemic injury. These results indicate that renal tubules have an active cyclin/CDK system, while glomeruli, do not have a cyclin/CDK system during active regeneration of kidneys after ischemic injury.",

        "abstract": "Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide in human pheochromocytoma. To evaluate whether AM could be an angiogenic factor, we examined its effect on kinases and angiogenic processes. AM induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) by using distinct signaling pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). AM also phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor inhibited AM-induced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. Pretreatment with high concentrations of AM22-52, a putative AM receptor antagonist, partially suppressed AM-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and focal adhesion kinase. AM and vascular endothelial growth factor produced increases in DNA synthesis and migration in HUVECs. AM induced tube formation in HUVECs, and its effect was inhibited by pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor or ERK1/2 inhibitor. AM induced sprouting in porcine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and promoted neovessel formation in a mouse Matrigel plug assay. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and ERK1/2 inhibited AM-induced endothelial sprouting in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. AM exerts angiogenic activity through activation of Akt, MAPK, and focal adhesion kinase in endothelial cells.",

Here we measured mast cell function in unilateral ureteral obstruction, a well-characterized model of renal fibrosis, using Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice genetically deficient in mast cells, wild-type mice, and deficient mice reconstituted by adoptive transfer with mast cells from the wild-type animals. Mast cell-deficient mice had higher levels of renal tubular damage, more stromal fibrosis, higher numbers of infiltrating ERHR3-positive macrophages and CD3-positive T cells, and higher tissue levels of profibrotic transforming growth factor-beta1 than wild-type mice or mice reconstituted by adoptive transfer of mast cells 3 weeks after ureteral obstruction. Similarly, while wild-type and adoptively transferred mice had increased alpha-smooth muscle actin and decreased E-cadherin expression, which are indicators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the obstructed kidneys of the mast cell-deficient mice had significant attenuation of those indicators. Thus, our study suggests that mast cells protect the kidney against fibrosis by modulation of inflammatory cell infiltration and by transforming growth factor-beta1-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions.",

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC) is a cysteine prodrug, and increases cellular glutathione (GSH). OTC is converted to cysteine by the intracellular enzyme, oxoprolinase. To date, the protective role of OTC on cisplatin-induced renal injury has not been investigated. The purpose of the present study was to examine the protective effect of OTC on cisplatin-induced renal injury and to examine the mechanism of its protection.Mice were treated with cisplatin with or without administration of OTC. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were determined in the kidney using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, immunostaining or western blot analysis. Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity, infiltration of F4/80-positive cells and apoptosis were also investigated in addition to renal function and histology using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunostaining, western blot analysis, uridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labelling or periodic acid-Schiff staining. The effect of OTC on superoxide dismutase activity and GSH level in cisplatin-treated normal adult human kidney (HK-2) cells were measured using assay kits.The administration of OTC resulted in a significant reduction of cisplatin-induced ROS production, the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB translocation into nucleus, expression of ICAM-1, caspase 3 activity, expression of MCP-1 and the infiltration of macrophages into renal tissue. OTC markedly ameliorated renal damage induced by cisplatin through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect.These results suggest that OTC can be a potential therapeutic agent in cisplatin-induced renal injury through decreasing the ROS levels and activation of NF-kappaB.",

        "abstract": "Fractalkine is a unique chemokine that functions as a chemoattractant as well as an adhesion molecule on endothelial cells activated by proinflammatory cytokines. Alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a naturally occurring dithiol compound, is an essential cofactor for mitochondrial bioenergetic enzymes. LA improves glycemic control, reduces diabetic polyneuropathies, and mitigates toxicity associated with heavy metal poisoning. The effects of LA on processes associated with sepsis, however, are unknown. We evaluated the antiinflammatory effect of LA on fractalkine expression in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia model. Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) significantly induced fractalkine mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells. LA strongly suppressed TNF-- or IL-1-induced fractalkine expression in endothelial cells by suppressing the activities of nuclear factor-B and specificity protein-1. LA also decreased TNF-- or IL-1-stimulated monocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. As shown by immunohistochemistry, fractalkine protein expression was markedly increased by treatment with lipopolysaccharide in arterial endothelial cells, endocardium, and endothelium of intestinal villi. LA suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced fractalkine protein expression and infiltration of endothelin 1-positive cells into the heart and intestine in vivo. LA protected against lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial dysfunction and improved survival in lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia. These results suggest that LA could be an effective agent to reduce fractalkine-mediated inflammatory processes in endotoxemia. (Circ Res. 2005;97:880-890.)",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of haemodialysis (HD) on the plasma concentration of DNP, and to investigate the relationship between the 2-D echocardiographic parameters and the changes in the plasma DNP levels during HD.Forty-five haemodialysis patients and 22 healthy individuals underwent a measurement of plasma DNP-like immunoreactivity, serum creatinine, haematocrit, blood pressure and bodyweight before and after each HD session. Echocardiography was performed before and after HD. The peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E), peak late diastolic transmitral flow velocity (A), and E/A ratio were measured by using a pulsed Doppler echocardiogram.The plasma DNP-like immunoreactivity of those in the pre-HD state was significantly higher (235.6 +/- 45.8 pg/mL) than those of the healthy subjects (105.3 +/- 31.1 pg/mL). In addition, the plasma DNP-like immunoreactivity was significantly decreased after HD (204.4 +/- 55.4 pg/mL). The left atrial diameter, left ventricular diameter at end diastole and end systol, E velocity, A velocity, E/A ratio and inferior vena cava diameter were significantly decreased after HD. There were significant correlations between the changes of plasma DNP-like immunoreactivity and the changes in the bodyweight and inferior vena cava diameter, respectively.These results suggest that the plasma DNP-like immunoreactivity might be involved in the regulation of the blood volume in patients undergoing HD.",

        "abstract": "Inflammatory processes have been recently seen as underlying the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) plays essential roles in regulating vascular growth, development, maturation, permeability and inflammation. We have developed a soluble, stable and potent Ang1 variant, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)-Ang1.In this study, db/db mice were treated with recombinant adenovirus expressing either COMP-Ang1 or LacZ. Histology, inflammatory, metabolic, and fibrotic parameters and signalling pathway were evaluated.COMP-Ang1 reduced albuminuria and decreased mesangial expansion, thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and podocyte foot process broadening and effacement. COMP-Ang1 suppressed both renal expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and monocyte/macrophage infiltration in diabetic db/db mice. COMP-Ang1 also reduced renal tissue levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, as well as Smad 2/3 expression, but increased Smad 7 expression. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) grown in high glucose concentrations of glucose, recombinant COMP-Ang1 protein decreased nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) expression. COMP-Ang1-mediated inhibition of increased NF-kappaB-DNA binding in nuclear extracts from HUVECs grown in high glucose was significantly blocked by soluble Tie2 receptor-Fc. In addition, COMP-Ang1 significantly decreased fasting blood glucose level, epididymal fat weight to body weight ratio, and epididymal adipocyte size in diabetic db/db mice. After intraperitoneal glucose challenge, COMP-Ang1 significantly lowered plasma glucose levels. However, there was no difference in serum insulin levels.We conclude that COMP-Ang1 delayed the fibrotic changes in the kidney of diabetic db/db mice through its anti-inflammatory or metabolic effects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Acute interstitial nephritis is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The granulomatous inflammation is rarely but often manifests as a form of a granulomatous interstitial nephritis (GIN) in the kidney. Acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis is mainly associated with drugs, infection and autoimmune diseases. Case presentation A 44-year-old-male visited our out-patient department with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and general weakness that had developed over the previous 2 weeks. He had history of medication, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On admission to the general ward, his serum creatinine level was markedly elevated. GIN was confirmed by renal biopsy and 30 mg of corticosteroid per day was immediately initiated. Subsequently, his serum creatinine level and uremic symptoms dramatically decreased. Conclusion Acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis is a rare but important disease on AKI. As long as we can carefully exclude infectious diseases as the cause of granulomatous lesion, acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis can be treated with steroid regardless of the etiologies. Since there is no proven treatment for the GIN yet, we can carefully suggest that moderate to high dosage corticosteroid can be helpful for prognosis in case of acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis of patients with AKI.",

        "abstract": "Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is characterized by sustained inflammation and excessive extracellular matrix\u00a0(ECM) accumulation, leading to chronic kidney disease. Valproic acid (VPA) has anticancer activity through regulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis via inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and is considered a class I HDAC inhibitor. In this study, the effect of VPA on unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)\u2011induced renal fibrosis by modulation of renal inflammation and ECM gene transcription was investigated. VPA treatment increased histone\u00a0H3 acetylation in both sham\u2011 and UUO\u2011operated kidneys and decreased the UUO\u2011induced increase in tubular injury and ECM deposition in mice. VPA also decreased myofibroblast activation and proliferation in UUO kidneys and NRK\u201149F cells. Finally, it was demonstrated that the anti\u2011fibrotic effect of VPA was associated with regulation of ECM protein promoter enrichment at an acetylated histone\u00a0H3 site. In conclusion, the findings indicate that VPA may have a beneficial effect on UUO\u2011induced renal fibrosis via regulation of myofibroblast activation, proliferation, and ECM protein production by chromatin remodeling and ECM protein promoter transcription.",

        "abstract": "Mannitol therapy is widely used for reducing brain edema, and ischemic brain swelling. However, mannitol at clinical concentrations induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. Because apoptosis may be a pathogenic mechanism in vascular injury, antiapoptotic agents may have a protective role in mannitol-induced apoptosis. In this study, we examined whether adrenomedullin (AM) prevents mannitol-induced apoptosis and also evaluated the associated signaling pathway of AM in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. AM prevented mannitol-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with wortmannin blocked the AM-induced antiapoptotic effect. AM stimulated Akt at Ser473, and wortmannin inhibited the AM-induced Akt phosphorylation. These findings indicate that phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway transmits the survival signal from AM. The potency of antiapoptotic effect of AM is stronger than that of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 in mannitol-induced apoptosis. AM can have a protective role not only in umbilical vein, but also in pulmonary, coronary, and aortic endothelial cells. These findings indicate that AM has a potent protective role in mannitol-induced apoptosis, through phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway. Therefore, pretreatment with AM might help to maintain normal endothelial integrity during systemic mannitol therapy.",

        "abstract": "Peritubular capillary injury induces chronic hypoxia in the renal tubulointerstitium, and renal peritubular capillary dysfunction is an early event that contributes to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a potent immunosuppressant and improves survival of renal allografts. However, the limitation of CsA use is chronic nephrotoxicity. A soluble, stable and potent angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) variant, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)-Ang1 has been developed. We investigated whether COMP-Ang1 ameliorates CsA-induced renal injury.CsA-treated mice were injected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either COMP-Ang1 or LacZ. Histology, inflammatory, haemodynamic and fibrotic parameters, and signalling pathway were evaluated.Histologic examination showed that COMP-Ang1 significantly decreased CsA-induced tubular damage and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. CsA-induced increases in macrophage infiltration and expression of MCP-1 and ICAM-1 after CsA treatment were significantly reduced by COMP-Ang1. Treatment with COMP-Ang1 also decreased the CsA-induced increases in TGF-beta1 and Smad 2/3 levels while increasing Smad 7 levels. Laser-Doppler sonographic findings and endothelial factor VIII staining revealed that COMP-Ang1 preserved the integrity of peritubular vasculature and intrarenal haemodynamics from the CsA-induced renal injury. COMP-Ang1 inhibited tubular cell apoptosis while increasing tubular cell proliferation in CsA-induced renal injury.These results indicate that COMP-Ang1 exhibited a protective effect on damaged peritubular capillaries, haemodynamic alteration and inflammation in CsA-induced renal injury. Thus, COMP-Ang1 may be useful as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent for specific protection against endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.",

Recent studies have shown that the preproghrelin Leu72Met polymorphism is associated with serum creatinine (Scr) concentration in type 2 diabetes; 72Met carriers exhibited lower Scr levels as compared with the 72Met non-carriers. We hypothesized that the preproghrelin Leu72Met polymorphism is associated with a lower rate of developing renal dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy.The preproghrelin Leu72Met polymorphism was investigated using PCR techniques in 138 patients with diabetic nephropathy divided into two groups, one with normal renal function and the other with renal dysfunction.Determination of the frequency of the preproghrelin Leu72Met polymorphism was the main outcome measure.The frequency of the Leu72Met polymorphism in diabetic nephropathy was significantly lower in patients with renal dysfunction (15.9%, P < 0.01) than in patients with normal renal function (42.0%) or in the diabetes control group (40.6%). The Leu72Met polymorphism was also associated with serum total cholesterol levels in diabetic nephropathy patients with renal dysfunction; the 72Met carriers had lower total cholesterol levels than the 72Met non-carriers (P < 0.05).These data suggest that 72Met carrier status may be used as a marker predicting a lower chance of developing renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy.",

        "abstract": "Whole blood viscosity (WBV) plays a role in hemorheology and is determined by many factors such as red blood cell factors, plasma protein and blood volume. As WBV changes during hemodialysis, mortality may be due to changes in WBV in patients on hemodialysis. However, there are few prospective data on the relationship between changes in WBV and overall mortality in dialysis patients. We tried to investigate the correlations between values of WBV at variable shear rates before and after hemodialysis and overall or atherosclerosis-related mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease.Forty-three patients receiving hemodialysis were enrolled in this study. In this 5.8-year prospective observational study, analyses of the effects of WBV at shear rates of 300 s-1 (systolic WBV; SBV), 5 s-1 (diastolic WBV5; DBV5), and 1 s-1 (diastolic WBV1; DBV1) during dialysis on all-cause and atherosclerotic mortality was performed.Among a total of 43 patients, 27 (62.7%) died over the course of the study. Thirteen deaths were caused by atherosclerotic events. A high degree of change in WBV at shear rates of 300 s-1 and 5 s-1 during hemodialysis (\u0394SBV, \u0394DBV5) was positively correlated with overall mortality (HR\u200a=\u200a4.688, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.269-17.319, p\u200a=\u200a0.020; HR\u200a=\u200a3.941, 95% CI, 1.057-14.701, p\u200a=\u200a0.041, respectively). A high degree of change in diastolic blood pressure (\u0394DBP) during hemodialysis was also positively correlated with overall mortality (HR\u200a=\u200a3.035, 95% CI, 1.039-8.867, p\u200a=\u200a0.042). However, comparative analysis between WBV at shear rates of 300 s-1, 5 s-1, and 1 s-1 and overall mortality did not reveal any significant relationships. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the all-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients from a high degree of change of WBV at shear rates of 300 s-1, compared to those from the moderate or low degree of changes of WBV at shear rates of 300 s-1 (p\u200a=\u200a0.020, log-rank test). Survival rate in high \u0394DBP was lower than that of moderate or low \u0394DBP group in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p\u200a=\u200a0.004, log-rank test).Our data showed that a high degree of change in WBV at variable shear rates during hemodialysis might impact overall survival in patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, large-scale studies to evaluate the relationship of WBV with overall mortality and atherosclerotic mortality will be needed.",

        "abstract": "Vitisin A, a resveratrol tetramer isolated from Vitis vinifera roots, exhibits antioxidative, anticancer, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. It also inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production. Here, we examined the mechanism by which vitisin A inhibits NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Vitisin A dose dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. In contrast, the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not altered by vitisin A. To investigate the signaling pathway for NO inhibition by vitisin A, we examined nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, an inflammation-induced signal pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. Vitisin A inhibited LPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 phosphorylation and suppressed LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. This suggests that vitisin A decreased NO production via downregulation of ERK1/2 and p38 and the NF-kappaB signal pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.",

        "abstract": "In the initial phase of inflammation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can act as a proinflammatory cytokine by inducing adhesion molecules that bind leukocytes to endothelial cells. Adrenomedullin (AM) is known to act as either a proinflammatory or an anti-inflammatory agent. In this study, we examined the effects of AM on adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte adhesiveness in VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells.When stimulated with VEGF, the mRNAs of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin were dose-dependently upregulated. AM inhibited the VEGF-induced protein and mRNA expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor and a dominant-negative form of Akt significantly inhibited the suppressive effect of AM on VEGF-induced adhesion molecule expression. Thus, AM inhibits VEGF-stimulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression through a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway. AM reduced VEGF-induced endothelial adhesiveness for leukocytes.These results suggest that AM might have an anti-inflammatory role in controlling VEGF-induced adhesion molecule gene expression and adhesiveness toward leukocytes in endothelial cells.",

Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), such as rosiglitazone, have been recently demonstrated to regulate inflammation by modulating the production of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effects of rosiglitazone on cisplatin nephrotoxicity and to explore the mechanism of its renoprotection.Mice were treated with cisplatin with or without pre-treatment with rosiglitazone. Renal functions, histological findings, aquaporin 2 (AQP2) and adhesion molecule expression, macrophage infiltration and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were investigated. The effect of rosiglitazone on nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity and on viability was examined using cultured human kidney (HK-2) cells.Rosiglitazone significantly decreased both the damage to renal function and histological pathology after cisplatin injection. Pre-treatment with rosiglitazone reduced the systemic levels of TNF-alpha and down-regulated adhesion molecule expression in addition to the infiltration of inflammatory cells after cisplatin administration. Rosiglitazone restored the decreased AQP2 expression after cisplatin treatment. Pre-treatment with rosiglitazone blocked the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in cultured HK-2 cells. Rosiglitazone had a protective effect via a PPARgamma-dependent pathway in cisplatin-treated HK-2 cells.These results showed that pre-treatment with rosiglitazone attenuates cisplatin-induced renal damage through the suppression of TNF-alpha overproduction and NF-kappaB activation.",

        "abstract": "This study was undertaken to compare renal damage, as determined by serum creatinine and degree of apoptosis, caused by iodinated contrast or gadolinium in an acute renal failure (ARF) rat model. Rats were divided into three groups; controls (n=3), a CT contrast medium group (n=9), and an MR contrast medium group (n=9). The CT and MR groups were further subdivided into three groups, namely, low, standard, and high dose subgroups. Renal function was evaluated by determining serum creatinine levels; before ARF, and 48 hr after ARF and contrast administration. Apoptosis was assayed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). No significant creatinine level differences were observed between the CT and MR groups (p=0.116). Degrees of apoptosis in the renal cortex and medulla were more severe in the CT contrast medium group than in the control or MR contrast medium group (p<0.05). The study shows that CT contrast medium did not aggravate renal function more so than MR contrast medium in this ARF rat model. However, apoptosis examination in the renal cortex and medulla indicated that CT contrast medium induced more severe apoptosis than MR contrast medium (p<0.05). We conclude that CT contrast medium can be used for renal imaging studies when subjects are well hydrated and preventive medication is administered.",

We found that genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with broad specificities, and which also has estrogen-like activity, had protective effects on cisplatin-induced renal injury in mice. Genistein significantly decreased reactive oxygen species production, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 proteins, as well as the translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-B into the nucleus and the infiltration of macrophages, all of which were increased in the kidney by cisplatin treatment. Genistein also decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis by regulating p53 induction in kidney. Genistein significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production in cisplatin-treated normal human kidney HK-2 cells. These studies show that genistein or similar compounds might be useful in prevention of cisplatin-induced renal injury.",

        "abstract": "Cisplatin\u2011based chemotherapy is commonly used in the treatment of solid tumors; however, this agent is limited by its adverse effects on normal tissues, including the kidneys, ears and peripheral nerves. Mechanisms of cisplatin nephrotoxicity are proposed to involve oxidative stress, inflammation, cellular apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Sirtuin\u00a03 (Sirt3) is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+\u2011dependent enzymes with homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene silent information regulator 2. Sirt3 is located in mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and function; however, the role of Sirt3 in cisplatin nephrotoxicity remains unclear. In the present study, whether Sirt3 has anti\u2011inflammatory and anti\u2011apoptotic effects on cisplatin\u2011induced nephrotoxicity was investigated in mice. Sirt3 knockout mice (Sirt3(\u2011/\u2011)) and corresponding wild type mice were employed in the present study. Cisplatin nephrotoxicity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (20\u00a0mg/kg). After 3\u00a0days following cisplatin treatment, blood and kidney tissues were harvested. Renal function and histology were evaluated. Tubular apoptosis, cell adhesion molecule expression, and inflammatory cells were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Following the induction of cisplatin nephrotoxicity, renal function was significantly aggravated in Sirt3 knockout (KO) mice. Tubular injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly increased in Sirt3KO mice compared with wild type mice. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\u2011mediated dUTP nick\u2011end label\u2011positive tubular cells and renal monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20111 expression levels were increased in Sirt3KO mice compared with in wild type mice. In summary, the absence of Sirt3 aggravated in renal injury by increasing renal inflammation and tubular apoptosis. The results of the present study suggested that Sirt3 may have an important role in cisplatin\u2011induced nephrotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, infectious diseases and allergies. Vascular alterations are an important pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis. Experimental data suggest that paricalcitol, a vitamin D2 analogue, exerts beneficial effects on renal inflammation and fibrosis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of paricalcitol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced myocardial inflammation and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We used primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells for in vitro experiments, in which stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 was used to induce endothelial cell inflammation. For in vivo experiments, myocardial inflammation was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg LPS into C57BL6 mice pre-treated with or without 0.2 \u00b5g/kg paricalcitol. Treatment with paricalcitol suppressed the TNF-\u03b1-induced increase in the protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fractalkine in endothelial cells. Treatment with paricalcitol also decreased the TNF-\u03b1-induced nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB binding activity. In a mouse model of LPS-induced myocardial inflammation, pre-treatment with paricalcitol prevented the LPS-induced increase in the expression of myocardial ICAM-1, phosphorylated p65 and myocardial TNF-\u03b1. Pre-treatment with paricalcitol also alleviated endotoxemia-induced microvascular leakage in the myocardium. The findings of our study suggest that paricalcitol exerts a protective effect against LPS-induced myocardial inflammation by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules and TNF-\u03b1, and by improving myocardial permeability.",

        "abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays a major role in and is essential for regulation, patterning, and proliferation during renal development. Smoothened (Smo) plays a pivot role in transducing the Shh-glioma-associated oncogene Kruppel family member. However, the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying the role of sustained Smo activation in postnatal kidney development is still not clearly understood. Using a conditional knockin mouse model that expresses a constitutively activated form of Smo (SmoM2) upon Homeobox-B7-mediated recombination (Hoxb7-Cre), the effects of Shh signaling were determined in postnatal kidney development. SmoM2;Hoxb7-Cre mutant mice showed growth retardation with a reduction of body weight. Constitutive activation of Smo in the renal collecting ducts caused renal hypoplasia, hydronephrosis, and hydroureter. The parenchymal area and glomerular numbers were reduced, but the glomerular density was increased in SmoM2;Hoxb7-Cre mutant mice. The expression of Patched 1, the receptor of Shh and a downstream target gene of the Shh signaling pathway, was highly restricted and it was upregulated in the inner medullary collecting ducts of the kidney. The proliferative cells in the mesenchyme and collecting ducts were decreased in SmoM2;Hoxb7-Cre mutant mice. This study showed for the first time that sustained Smo inhibits postnatal kidney development by suppressing the proliferation of the mesenchyme and medullary collecting ducts in mice.",

        "abstract": "Because of increases in the elderly population and diabetic patients, the proportion of elderly among dialysis patients has rapidly increased during the last decades. The mortality and morbidity of these elderly dialysis patients are obviously much higher than those of young patients, but large analytic studies about elderly dialysis patients' characteristics have rarely been published. The registry committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology has collected data about dialysis therapy in Korea through an Internet online registry program and analyzed the characteristics. A survey on elderly dialysis patients showed that more than 50% of elderly (65 years and older) patients had diabetic nephropathy as the cause of end-stage renal disease,\u00a0and approximately 21% of elderly dialysis patients had hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The proportion of elderly hemodialysis (HD) patients with native vessel arteriovenous fistula as vascular access for HD was lower than that of young (under 65 years) HD patients (69% vs. 80%). Although the vascular access was poor and small surface area dialyzers were used for the elderly HD patients, the dialysis adequacy data of elderly patients were better than those of young patients. The laboratory data of elderly dialysis patients were not very different from those of young patients, but poor nutrition factors were observed in the elderly dialysis patients. Although small surface area dialyzers were used for elderly HD patients, the urea reduction ratio and Kt/V were higher in elderly HD patients than in young patients.",

        "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a widely used cancer treatment, but it causes side effects even when localized radiotherapy is used. Extensive apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells of the lamina propria is the primary lesion initiating intestinal radiation damage after abdominal radiation therapy. Many in vitro studies suggest that angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) has potential therapeutic applications in enhancing endothelial cell survival. For in vivo use, we developed a soluble, stable, and potent Ang1 variant, COMP-Ang1. COMP-Ang1 is more potent than native Ang1 in phosphorylating the Tie2 receptor in lung endothelial cells in vivo. Interestingly, COMP-Ang1 administered i.v. was mainly localized to microvascular endothelial cells of the intestinal villi and lung but not to microvascular endothelial cells of the liver. In irradiated mice, i.v. COMP-Ang1 protected against radiation-induced apoptosis in microcapillary endothelial cells of the intestinal villi and prolonged survival. Thus, COMP-Ang1 could be used as a therapeutic protein for specific protection against endothelial cell injury.",

However, production of Ang1 is hindered by aggregation and insolubility resulting from disulfide-linked higher-order structures.

This variant is more potent than native Ang1 in phosphorylating the tyrosine kinase with Ig and epidermal growth factor homology domain 2 (Tie2) receptor and Akt in primary cultured endothelial cells, enhancing angiogenesis in vitro and increasing adult angiogenesis in vivo.

        "abstract": "Objectives  The primary aim of this non-inferiority study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of generic escitalopram (Lexacure) versus branded escitalopram (Lexapro) for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).    Methods  The present study included 158 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive a flexible dose of generic escitalopram ( n \u00a0=\u00a078) or branded escitalopram ( n \u00a0=\u00a080) over a 6-week single-blind treatment period. The clinical benefits in the two groups were evaluated using the Montgomery\u2013Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale (CGI-S), and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) at baseline, week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 6. The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was also assessed to determine safety at each follow-up visit.    Results  At week 6, 28 patients (57.1%) in the generic escitalopram group and 35 patients (67.3%) in the branded escitalopram group had responded to treatment ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.126), and the remission rates (MADRS score: \u2264\u00a010) were 42.9% ( n \u00a0=\u00a021) in generic escitalopram group and 53.8% ( n \u00a0=\u00a028) in the branded escitalopram group ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.135). The most frequently reported AEs were nausea (17.9%) in the generic escitalopram group and nausea (20.0%) in the branded escitalopram group.    Conclusions  The present non-inferiority study demonstrated that generic escitalopram is a safe and effective initial treatment for patients with MDD and may also be considered as an additional therapeutic option for this population.",

They were conveniently assigned to either \"forest\" group participating in the forest therapy program or control group doing self-monitoring of BP. Measurements of salivary cortisol level and QoL were done at initial visits and at 8-week final visits.Both groups did not differ significantly in baseline clinical characteristics. The BP change at week 4 and week 8 did not differ between the two groups. Salivary cortisol level reduction was significantly larger and QoL measures improved significantly more in the forest group at week 8 compared with the control group.The forest therapy program did not induce prolonged systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction. However, considering the significant decrease in cortisol level and improvement in QoL measures, this may be a useful model of community hypertension management program.",

We developed and tested the effect of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based psychotherapy applied in a forest environment on major depressive disorder.We performed 4 sessions during 4 weeks (3 hours/session) in patients with major depressive disorder during pharmacotherapy. For the forest group, sessions were performed in the forest; for the hospital group, sessions were performed in the hospital. The control group was treated with the usual outpatient management.A total of 63 patients completed the study: 23 in the forest group, 19 in the hospital group, and 21 in the control group. Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HRSD) scores of the forest group were significantly decreased after 4 sessions compared with controls. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales (MADRS) scores of the forest group were significantly decreased compared with both the hospital group and the controls. The remission rate (7 and below in HRSD) of the forest group was 61% (14/23), significantly higher than both the hospital group (21%, 4/19) and the controls (5%, 1/21). In heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, some measurements representing HRV and parasympathetic nerve tone were increased in the forest group after 4 sessions. The salivary cortisol levels of the forest group were significantly decreased.CBT-based psychotherapy applied in the forest environment was helpful in the achievement of depression remission, and its effect was superior to that of psychotherapy performed in the hospital and the usual outpatient management. A good environment such as a forest helps improve the effect of psychotherapeutic intervention because it includes various natural instruments and facilitators in the treatment of depression.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the left and right temporoparietal cortex compared with sham stimulation in schizophrenic patients with treatment-refractory auditory hallucinations (AH). Thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia with treatment-refractory AH were allocated randomly to one of three groups: daily left, right, and sham rTMS groups. rTMS was applied to the TP3 or 4 regions with the aid of the electroencephalography 10-20 international system at 1 Hz for 20 min per day for 10 treatment days. Symptoms were evaluated using the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS), the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression--Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impression--Improvement (CGI-I) scale. For the time effect (within-subject comparison), there were significant changes in the frequency of AHs, positive symptoms of PANSS, and CGI-I. A between-group comparison revealed significant differences in the positive symptoms of PANSS, and CGI-I scores. Post hoc analysis revealed that both the right- and left-side rTMS treatment groups exhibited better CGI-I scores compared to the sham-stimulated group. This study suggests that 10 days of low-frequency rTMS applied daily for 20 min to either temporoparietal cortex significantly reduces the symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who are having refractory AH, but the left sided rTMS is not superior to right or sham rTMS.",

        "abstract": "Few studies for the long-term effects of antidepressants on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been conducted. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of mirtazapine during the 24-week continuation treatment in patients with PTSD. Out of 15 patients who participated in the previous 8-week short-term study, 12 patients completed 24-week continuation treatment with mirtazapine. The effectiveness was evaluated at week 12 and week 24 using Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Short PTSD Rating Interview (SPRINT), Interviewer-Administered Structured Interview for PTSD (SIP) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The tolerability of continuation treatment was also reported. The scores on the IES-R, SPRINT, SIP and MADRS were significantly reduced over time from baseline to week 24, the end-point (F=36.1, d.f.=4, P<0.001; F=106.3, d.f.=4, P<0.001; F=121.1, d.f.=4, P<0.001; F=198.9, d.f.=4, P<0.001). On post-hoc analysis, the scores of all four measures were significantly reduced at the end point since week 8. However, after Bonferroni's correction, that was statistically significant in SPRINT only. The number of patients whose scores were reduced over 50% in all four scales had a tendency of incremental increase from three at week 8 to eight at the end point (P=0.063). No serious drug-related side-effects occurred. These results suggest that the mirtazapine may be effective in the continuation treatment of PTSD as well as short-term treatment. Further and better-designed studies are necessary.",

This report investigated the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the SPRINT (K-SPRINT).Eighty-seven PTSD patients, 47 other psychiatric patients, and 63 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. All subjects completed a psychometric assessment package that included the K-SPRINT and the Korean versions of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).The K-SPRINT showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.82). K-SPRINT showed moderatecorrelations with CAPS (r = 0.71). An exploratory factor analysis produced one K-SPRINT factor. The optimal diagnostic efficiency (91.9%) of the K-SPRINT was found at a total score of 15, at which point the sensitivity and specificity were 90.8% and 92.7%, respectively.The present findings demonstrate that the K-SPRINT had good psychometric properties and can be used as a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of PTSD.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal changes in romantic love over a period of 6 months and their correlated neurophysiological changes.Five heterosexual couples (n=10, mean age 21.1+/-1.97) who started dating not less than 100 days previously were recruited to measure their blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while showing them pictures of their loved ones and their previously identified, opposite-sex friends. Subsequently, the subjects were scanned under the same experimental conditions to assess possible changes in their brain activities after 180 days.WE FOUND THAT THEIR PASSIONATE LOVE SCORE (PLS) VALUES (M: 118.6+/-9.1, F: 120.2+/-7.0) were significantly reduced after 6 months (M: 110.8+/-4.0, F: 106.2+/-3.0). Furthermore, significantly increased activations were found in the cingulate gyri, inferior frontal gyri, supramarginal gyri, etc., after 6 months, whereas the head and tail of the right caudate nucleus were deactivated, which is indicative of the inhibition of expression and sensory neglect.These findings suggest that dynamic neural processes in the cortical-subcortical regions are involved in temporal changes in romantic love.",

        "abstract": "For diagnosis and management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the easily administered assessment tool is essential. Structured Interview for PTSD (SIP) is a validated, 17-item, simple measurement being used widely. We aimed to develop the Korean version of SIP (K-SIP) and investigated its psychometric properties. Ninety-three subjects with PTSD, 73 subjects with mood disorder or anxiety disorder as a psychiatric control group, and 88 subjects as a healthy control group were enrolled in this study. All subjects completed psychometric assessments that included the K-SIP, the Korean versions of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and other assessment tools. The K-SIP presented good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.92) and test-retest reliability (r=0.87). K-SIP showed strong correlations with CAPS (r=0.72). Among three groups including PTSD patients, psychiatric controls, and normal controls, there were significant differences in the K-SIP total score. The potential cut-off total score of K-SIP was 20 with highest diagnostic efficiency (91.9%). At this point, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% and 88.4%, respectively. Our result showed that K-SIP had good reliability and validity. We expect that K-SIP will be used as a simple but structured instrument for assessment of PTSD.",

        "abstract": "Depressive disorders influence socioeconomic burden at both the individual and organizational levels. This study estimates the lost productive time (LPT) and its resulting cost among workers with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with a comparison group. It also estimates the change in productivity after 8 weeks of outpatient psychiatric treatment with antidepressants.Working patients diagnosed with MDD without other major physical or mental disorders were recruited (n = 102), along with age- and sex-matched healthy controls from the Seoul Metropolitan area (n = 91). The World Health Organization's Health and Work Performance Questionnaire and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were utilized to measure productivity and severity of depression, respectively, at baseline and at 8 weeks of treatment.The LPT from absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced performance while present at work) was significantly higher among the MDD group. Workers with MDD averaged costs due to LPT at 33.4% of their average annual salary, whereas the comparison group averaged costs of 2.5% of annual salary. After 8 weeks of treatment, absenteeism and clinical symptoms of depression were significantly reduced and associated with significant improvement in self-rated job performance (31.8%) or cost savings of $7508 per employee per year.We confirmed that significant productivity loss arises from MDD and that this loss can be reduced with psychiatric intervention after a time period as short as 8 weeks. Mental health professionals should work with employers to devise a cost-effective system to provide workers with accessible quality care.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of the alcohol hangover on cytokine production in healthy subjects. The hangover state was defined as 13 h after drinking 1.5 g/kg of alcohol (blood alcohol level=0). A venous blood sample was taken from 20 healthy adult men before consumption of alcohol and during the hangover state. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated and stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the production of the following cytokines: interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We found that the concentrations of IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-gamma were significantly increased during the hangover state compared with the concentrations in normal conditions. These results support the suggestion that the dysregulated cytokine pathway (IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-gamma) is associated with the symptoms of hangovers.",

This multicenter study included 93 patients with PTSD, 73 nonpsychotic psychiatric patients, and 88 healthy controls drawn from 18 hospitals across the country. The subjects were assessed using IES-R-K, Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Beck Depression Inventory, and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; state anxiety subscale [STAI-S], trait anxiety subscale [STAI-T]) scales.In the reliability test, Cronbach alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability were .93 and 0.91, respectively, indicating that the IES-R-K has good internal consistency. One-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences in IES-R-K scores among the patients with PTSD, nonpsychotic psychiatric patients, and healthy controls (F = 139.1, P < .001). Duncan post hoc test showed the significant differences among the 3 groups. To assess the validity of the IES-R-K, correlation coefficient between the IES-R-K and CAPS, STAI-S, and STAI-T was calculated. We found that there was a relatively high degree of correlation between the IES-R-K and CAPS (r = 0.92, P < .001). However, there was a relatively less degree of correlation between STAI-S and STAI-T and IES-R-K (r = 0.30, P < .001). Taken these together, IES-R-K showed good discriminant validity.The IES-R-K showed good reliability and validity for the assessment of PTSD symptom severity. The IES-R-K is a useful instrument for assessing PTSD symptoms in Korea.",

The purposes of this study were to develop a Korean version of the DTS (DTS-K) while maintaining its basic structure and to evaluate its reliability and validity for the Korean population. Participants of this study included 93 patients with PTSD (PTSD group), 73 patients with nonpsychotic mood or other anxiety disorders (psychiatric control group), and 88 healthy controls (normal control group). Subjects completed psychometric assessments, including the DTS-K and the Korean version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. The DTS-K showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .97) and test-retest reliability (r = .93). The DTS-K showed a significantly positive correlation with Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (r = .94). The highest diagnostic efficiency of DTS-K was at a total score of 47, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.84, respectively. Our findings suggest that the DTS-K is composed of good psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable tool for assessing the frequency and severity of PTSD symptoms regardless of ethnicity.",

The actions of ghrelin and leptin appear to be mediated by the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related protein (AGRP) system. Recent studies have suggested that leptin and NPY play significant roles in the pathophysiology of alcoholism. The aim of this study was to determine whether ghrelin is associated with the state and duration of abstinence in individuals with alcohol dependence.Fasting plasma ghrelin levels were compared between 47 individuals with chronic alcoholism during a period of abstinence and 50 control subjects.Fasting plasma ghrelin levels were higher in alcohol abstainers than those in controls. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between ghrelin levels and the duration of abstinence. In addition, daily alcohol intake prior to abstinence was inversely related to ghrelin levels.These findings suggest that ghrelin plays a role in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence, particularly during the abstinence period, in individuals with chronic alcoholism.",

Ten subjects with no psychiatric illness were included as a control group. We conducted functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while a film alternatively played erotic and non-erotic contents for 14 minutes and 9 seconds.The control group showed activation in the occipitotemporal area, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. For subjects treated with SSRIs, the intensity of activity in these regions was much lower compared to the control group. Intensity of activation in the group treated with mirtazapine was less than the control group but grea-ter than those treated with SSRIs. Using subtraction analysis, the SSRI group showed significantly lower activation than the mirtazapine group in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the caudate nucleus.Our study suggests that the different rates of sexual side effects between the patients in the SSRI-treated group and the mirtazapine-treated group may be due to different effects on brain activation.",

The GSTM1 null genotype was significantly more frequent in the schizophrenia patients than in the controls (P=0.014, odds ratio=1.93, 95% confidence interval=1.115-3.351). On the other hand, the GSTM1 genotype variants were not associated with tardive dyskinesia or total abnormal involuntary movement scale scores.

All the subjects completed the assessment measures including Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Revised Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-R), Clinical Global Impression Scale--Severity of Illness (CGI-S), Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Responder analyses were conducted based on changes in CGI-I scores after 10 weeks of treatment. We found no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies in TPH A218C and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms between the panic patients and the control group. Subgroup analyses in terms of comorbidities, response, and other primary clinical variables, indicated no differences in these polymorphisms. Our findings suggest that the TPH A218C polymorphism and 5-HTTLPR play no significant roles in the pathogenesis and clinical symptomatologies, at least in a Korean population.",

Forty-one subjects were recruited. For our crossover design, subjects were divided into two groups based on similar demographic characteristics. Group A remained in the urban environment and was asked to perform regular breathing for 2 h. Blood samples were collected and the serum levels of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were examined. Subjects were moved to a small town in a rural area for an equal amount of time to exclude carryover effects, and then remained for another 2 h in a forest environment. The second set of blood samples was collected to assess the effect of exposure to the forest environment. Using the same method, Group B was first exposed to the forest environment, followed by exposure to the urban environment. Blood samples collected after the subjects were exposed to the forest environment showed significantly lower levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 compared to those in samples collected after urban environment exposure (10.76 vs. 9.21, t = 4.559, p < 0.001, and 0.97 vs. 0.87, t = 4.130, p < 0.001). The GPx concentration increased significantly after exposure to the forest environment (LnGPx = 5.09 vs. LnGPx = 5.21, t = -2.039, p < 0.05).",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of a two-day forest therapy program on individuals with chronic widespread pain. Sixty one employees of a public organization providing building and facilities management services within the Seoul Metropolitan area participated in the study. Participants were assigned to an experimental group (n = 33) who participated in a forest therapy program or a control group (n = 28) on a non-random basis. Pre- and post-measures of heart rate variability (HRV), Natural Killer cell (NK cell) activity, self-reported pain using the visual analog scale (VAS), depression level using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and health-related quality of life measures using the EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) were collected in both groups. The results showed that participants in the forest therapy group, as compared to the control group, showed physiological improvement as indicated by a significant increase in some measures of HRV and an increase in immune competence as indicated by NK cell activity. Participants in the forest therapy group also reported significant decreases in pain and depression, and a significant improvement in health-related quality of life. These results support the hypothesis that forest therapy is an effective intervention to relieve pain and associated psychological and physiological symptoms in individuals with chronic widespread pain.",

However, if one has a reasonably large collection of similar objects and the prior human judgments of a number of judges regarding the condition of each object in the collection, then it is possible to make predictions of future human judgments for the whole collection that are superior to the simple maximal likelihood estimate for each object in isolation. This is possible because the multiple judgments over the collection allow an analysis to determine the relative value of a judge as compared with the other judges in the group and this value can be used to augment or diminish a particular judge's influence in predicting future judgments. Here we study and compare five different methods for making such improved predictions and show that each is superior to simple maximal likelihood estimates.",

The research presented here addresses these issues by exploring methods for retriev- ing MEDLINE\u00ae citations that answer real bi- ologists' information needs and by addressing the initial tasks required to annotate MED- LINE citations having genomic content with terms from the Gene Ontology (GO). We ap- proached the retrieval task using two methods: aggressive, knowledge-intensive query expan- sion and text neighboring. Our approaches to the triage subtask for annotation consisted of traditional machine learning (ML) methods as well as a novel ML algorithm for thematic analysis. Finally, we used a statistical, n-gram heuristic to decide which of the GO hierar- chies should be used to annotate a given MEDLINE citation.",

        "abstract": "A significant fraction of queries in PubMed\u2122 are multiterm queries without parsing instructions. Generally, search engines interpret such queries as collections of terms, and handle them as a Boolean conjunction of these terms. However, analysis of queries in PubMed\u2122 indicates that many such queries are meaningful phrases, rather than simple collections of terms. In this study, we examine whether or not it makes a difference, in terms of retrieval quality, if such queries are interpreted as a phrase or as a conjunction of query terms. And, if it does, what is the optimal way of searching with such queries. To address the question, we developed an automated retrieval evaluation method, based on machine learning techniques, that enables us to evaluate and compare various retrieval outcomes. We show that the class of records that contain all the search terms, but not the phrase, qualitatively differs from the class of records containing the phrase. We also show that the difference is systematic, depending on the proximity of query terms to each other within the record. Based on these results, one can establish the best retrieval order for the records. Our findings are consistent with studies in proximity searching. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of biomedical literature presents challenges for automatic text processing, and one of the challenges is abbreviation identification. The presence of unrecognized abbreviations in text hinders indexing algorithms and adversely affects information retrieval and extraction. Automatic abbreviation definition identification can help resolve these issues. However, abbreviations and their definitions identified by an automatic process are of uncertain validity. Due to the size of databases such as MEDLINE only a small fraction of abbreviation-definition pairs can be examined manually. An automatic way to estimate the accuracy of abbreviation-definition pairs extracted from text is needed. In this paper we propose an abbreviation definition identification algorithm that employs a variety of strategies to identify the most probable abbreviation definition. In addition our algorithm produces an accuracy estimate, pseudo-precision, for each strategy without using a human-judged gold standard. The pseudo-precisions determine the order in which the algorithm applies the strategies in seeking to identify the definition of an abbreviation.On the Medstract corpus our algorithm produced 97% precision and 85% recall which is higher than previously reported results. We also annotated 1250 randomly selected MEDLINE records as a gold standard. On this set we achieved 96.5% precision and 83.2% recall. This compares favourably with the well known Schwartz and Hearst algorithm.We developed an algorithm for abbreviation identification that uses a variety of strategies to identify the most probable definition for an abbreviation and also produces an estimated accuracy of the result. This process is purely automatic.",

        "abstract": "Log analysis shows that PubMed users frequently use author names in queries for retrieving scientific literature. However, author name ambiguity may lead to irrelevant retrieval results. To improve the PubMed user experience with author name queries, we designed an author name disambiguation system consisting of similarity estimation and agglomerative clustering. A machine-learning method was employed to score the features for disambiguating a pair of papers with ambiguous names. These features enable the computation of pairwise similarity scores to estimate the probability of a pair of papers belonging to the same author, which drives an agglomerative clustering algorithm regulated by 2 factors: name compatibility and probability level. With transitivity violation correction, high precision author clustering is achieved by focusing on minimizing false-positive pairing. Disambiguation performance is evaluated with manual verification of random samples of pairs from clustering results. When compared with a state-of-the-art system, our evaluation shows that among all the pairs the lumping error rate drops from 10.1% to 2.2% for our system, while the splitting error rises from 1.8% to 7.7%. This results in an overall error rate of 9.9%, compared with 11.9% for the state-of-the-art method. Other evaluations based on gold standard data also show the increase in accuracy of our clustering. We attribute the performance improvement to the machine-learning method driven by a large-scale training set and the clustering algorithm regulated by a name compatibility scheme preferring precision. With integration of the author name disambiguation system into the PubMed search engine, the overall click-through-rate of PubMed users on author name query results improved from 34.9% to 36.9%.",

The authors study two relevance ranking strategies: term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting and sentence-level co-occurrence, and examine their ability to rank retrieved MEDLINE documents given user queries. Furthermore, the authors use the reverse chronological order-PubMed's default display option-as a baseline for comparison. Retrieval effectiveness is assessed using both mean average precision and mean rank precision. Experimental results show that retrievals based on the two strategies had improved performance over the baseline performance, and that TF-IDF weighting is more effective in retrieving relevant documents based on the comparison between the two strategies.",

We run Boolean searches based on a collection of 64 topics and about 160,000 MEDLINE(\u00ae) citations used in the 2006 and 2007 TREC Genomics Tracks. For each topic, we first automatically construct a query by selecting keywords from the question. Next, each query is expanded by ATM, which assigns different search tags to terms in the query. Three search tags: [MeSH Terms], [Text Words], and [All Fields] are chosen to be studied after expansion because they all make use of the MeSH field of indexed MEDLINE citations. Furthermore, we characterize the two different mechanisms by which the MeSH field is used. Retrieval results using MeSH after expansion are compared to those solely based on the words in MEDLINE title and abstracts. The aggregate retrieval performance is assessed using both F-measure and mean rank precision. Experimental results suggest that query expansion using MeSH in PubMed can generally improve retrieval performance, but the improvement may not affect end PubMed users in realistic situations.",

        "abstract": "Abbreviations and acronyms are widely used in the biomedical literature and many of them represent important biomedical concepts. Because many abbreviations are ambiguous (e.g., CAT denotes both chloramphenicol acetyl transferase and computed axial tomography, depending on the context), recognizing the full form associated with each abbreviation is in most cases equivalent to identifying the meaning of the abbreviation. This, in turn, allows us to perform more accurate natural language processing, information extraction, and retrieval. In this study, we have developed supervised approaches to identifying the full forms of ambiguous abbreviations within the context they appear. We first automatically assigned multiple possible full forms for each abbreviation; we then treated the in-context full-form prediction for each specific abbreviation occurrence as a case of word-sense disambiguation. We generated automatically a dictionary of all possible full forms for each abbreviation. We applied supervised machine-learning algorithms for disambiguation. Because some of the links between abbreviations and their corresponding full forms are explicitly given in the text and can be recovered automatically, we can use these explicit links to automatically provide training data for disambiguating the abbreviations that are not linked to a full form within a text. We evaluated our methods on over 150 thousand abstracts and obtain for coverage and precision results of 82&percnt; and 92&percnt;, respectively, when performed as tenfold cross-validation, and 79&percnt; and 80&percnt;, respectively, when evaluated against an external set of abstracts in which the abbreviations are not defined.",

        "abstract": "For the purposes of classification it is common to represent a document as a bag of words. Such a representation consists of the individual terms making up the document together with the number of times each term appears in the document. All classification methods make use of the terms. It is common to also make use of the local term frequencies at the price of some added complication in the model. Examples are the na\u00efve Bayes multinomial model (MM), the Dirichlet compound multinomial model (DCM) and the exponential-family approximation of the DCM (EDCM), as well as support vector machines (SVM). Although it is usually claimed that incorporating local word frequency in a document improves text classification performance, we here test whether such claims are true or not. In this paper we show experimentally that simplified forms of the MM, EDCM, and SVM models which ignore the frequency of each word in a document perform about at the same level as MM, DCM, EDCM and SVM models which incorporate local term frequency. We also present a new form of the na\u00efve Bayes multivariate Bernoulli model (MBM) which is able to make use of local term frequency and show again that it offers no significant advantage over the plain MBM. We conclude that word burstiness is so strong that additional occurrences of a word essentially add no useful information to a classifier.",

In this article, we introduce a machine learning framework for prioritizing CTD-relevant articles based on our prior system for the protein-protein interaction article classification task in BioCreative III. To address new challenges in the CTD task, we explore a new entity identification method for genes, chemicals and diseases. In addition, latent topics are analyzed and used as a feature type to overcome the small size of the training set. Applied to the BioCreative 2012 Triage dataset, our method achieved 0.8030 mean average precision (MAP) in the official runs, resulting in the top MAP system among participants. Integrated with PubTator, a Web interface for annotating biomedical literature, the proposed system also received a positive review from the CTD curation team.",

        "abstract": "Clustering methods can be useful for automatically grouping documents into meaningful clusters, improving human comprehension of a document collection. Although there are clustering algorithms that can achieve the goal for relatively large document collections, they do not always work well for small and homogenous datasets.In this article, we present Retro-a novel clustering algorithm that extracts meaningful clusters along with concise and descriptive titles from small and homogenous document collections. Unlike common clustering approaches, our algorithm predicts cluster titles before clustering. It relies on the hypergeometric distribution model to discover key phrases, and generates candidate clusters by assigning documents to these phrases. Further, the statistical significance of candidate clusters is tested using supervised learning methods, and a multiple testing correction technique is used to control the overall quality of clustering.We test our system on five disease datasets from OMIM(\u00ae) and evaluate the results based on MeSH(\u00ae) term assignments. We further compare our method with several baseline and state-of-the-art methods, including K-means, expectation maximization, latent Dirichlet allocation-based clustering, Lingo, OPTIMSRC and adapted GK-means. The experimental results on the 20-Newsgroup and ODP-239 collections demonstrate that our method is successful at extracting significant clusters and is superior to existing methods in terms of quality of clusters. Finally, we apply our system to a collection of 6248 topical sets from the HomoloGene(\u00ae) database, a resource in PubMed(\u00ae). Empirical evaluation confirms the method is useful for small homogenous datasets in producing meaningful clusters with descriptive titles.A web-based demonstration of the algorithm applied to a collection of sets from the HomoloGene database is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Wilbur/IRET/CLUSTERING_HOMOLOGENE/index.html.lana.yeganova@nih.govSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "PubMed\u00ae is a search engine providing access to a collection of over 27 million biomedical bibliographic records as of 2017. PubMed processes millions of queries a day, and understanding these queries is one of the main building blocks for successful information retrieval. In this work, we present Field Sensor, a domain-specific tool for understanding the composition and predicting the user intent of PubMed queries. Given a query, the Field Sensor infers a field for each token or sequence of tokens in a query in multi-step process that includes syntactic chunking, rule-based tagging and probabilistic field prediction. In this work, the fields of interest are those associated with (meta-)data elements of each PubMed record such as article title, abstract, author name(s), journal title, volume, issue, page and date. We evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm on a human-annotated corpus of 10\u00a0000 PubMed queries, as well as a new machine-annotated set of 103\u00a0000 PubMed queries. The Field Sensor achieves an accuracy of 93 and 91% on the two corresponding corpora and finds that nearly half of all searches are navigational (e.g. author searches, article title searches etc.) and half are informational (e.g. topical searches). The Field Sensor has been integrated into PubMed since June 2017 to detect informational queries for which results sorted by relevance can be suggested as an alternative to those sorted by the default date sort. In addition, the composition of PubMed queries as computed by the Field Sensor proves to be essential for understanding how users query PubMed.",

Humanly understandable well-formed phrases represent a crucial interface between humans and the web, and the ability to index and search with such phrases is beneficial for human-web interactions. In this paper we consider the problem of identifying humanly understandable, well formed, and high quality biomedical phrases in MEDLINE documents. The main approaches used previously for detecting such phrases are syntactic, statistical, and a hybrid approach combining these two. In this paper we propose a supervised learning approach for identifying high quality phrases. First we obtain a set of known well-formed useful phrases from an existing source and label these phrases as positive. We then extract from MEDLINE a large set of multiword strings that do not contain stop words or punctuation. We believe this unlabeled set contains many well-formed phrases. Our goal is to identify these additional high quality phrases. We examine various feature combinations and several machine learning strategies designed to solve this problem. A proper choice of machine learning methods and features identifies in the large collection strings that are likely to be high quality phrases. We evaluate our approach by making human judgments on multiword strings extracted from MEDLINE using our methods. We find that over 85% of such extracted phrase candidates are humanly judged to be of high quality.",

However, state-of-the-art name identification methods are not yet sufficient for use in a fully automated system. In this regard, a relaxed task, gene/protein sentence identification, may serve more effectively for manually searching and browsing biomedical literature. In this paper, we set up a new task, gene/protein sentence classification and propose an ensemble approach for addressing this problem. Well-known named entity tools use similar gold-standard sets for training and testing, which results in relatively poor performance for unknown sets. We here explore how to combine diverse high-precision gene identifiers for more robust performance.

Its success results from a more efficient use of information in weak hypotheses during updating. Instead of simple binary voting a weak hypothesis is allowed to vote for or against a classification with a variable strength or confidence. The Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm is a method for converting a score into a probability. We show how PAV may be applied to a weak hypothesis to yield a new weak hypothesis which is in a sense an ideal confidence rated prediction and that this leads to an optimal updating for AdaBoost. The result is a new algorithm which we term PAV-AdaBoost. We give several examples illustrating problems for which this new algorithm provides advantages in performance.",

        "abstract": "There are several humanly defined ontologies relevant to Medline. However, Medline is a fast growing collection of biomedical documents which creates difficulties in updating and expanding these humanly defined ontologies. Automatically identifying meaningful categories of entities in a large text corpus is useful for information extraction, construction of machine learning features, and development of semantic representations. In this paper we describe and compare two methods for automatically learning meaningful biomedical categories in Medline. The first approach is a simple statistical method that uses part-of-speech and frequency information to extract a list of frequent nouns from Medline. The second method implements an alignment-based technique to learn frequent generic patterns that indicate a hyponymy/hypernymy relationship between a pair of noun phrases. We then apply these patterns to Medline to collect frequent hypernyms as potential biomedical categories.We study and compare these two alternative sets of terms to identify semantic categories in Medline. We find that both approaches produce reasonable terms as potential categories. We also find that there is a significant agreement between the two sets of terms. The overlap between the two methods improves our confidence regarding categories predicted by these independent methods.This study is an initial attempt to extract categories that are discussed in Medline. Rather than imposing external ontologies on Medline, our methods allow categories to emerge from the text.",

With the rapid growth of biomedical literature-about two articles are added every minute on average-finding and retrieving the most relevant papers for a given query is increasingly challenging. We present Best Match, a new relevance search algorithm for PubMed that leverages the intelligence of our users and cutting-edge machine-learning technology as an alternative to the traditional date sort order. The Best Match algorithm is trained with past user searches with dozens of relevance-ranking signals (factors), the most important being the past usage of an article, publication date, relevance score, and type of article. This new algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art retrieval performance in benchmarking experiments as well as an improved user experience in real-world testing (over 20% increase in user click-through rate). Since its deployment in June 2017, we have observed a significant increase (60%) in PubMed searches with relevance sort order: it now assists millions of PubMed searches each week. In this work, we hope to increase the awareness and transparency of this new relevance sort option for PubMed users, enabling them to retrieve information more effectively.",

The purpose of a word salad is to fool the search engines into assigning high ranks to the document. In this paper, we discuss an algorithm that filters (detects) paragraph-inserted word salads.

It consists of two major components. One is to enhance software (computer science) education in universities, and another is to make coding education mandatory in elementary and middle schools.   The Korean Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) launched National Programs of Excellence in Software to innovate and expand software education in universities. The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the MSIT, has required all middle schools and elementary schools to include mandatory coding courses, starting in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and started training teachers.   In this article, we will discuss the background of the MSIT software initiative, and software education innovation by the Gachon University National Program of Excellence in Software.

The top 20 Google search results on online business models are articles that explain online business models. However, each of them deals with just one or two elements of business strategies. The list of business models is also a mixture of business strategies. This paper aims to provide practical guide that puts these business models into proper perspective.Design/methodology/approachA business model includes all key elements of the business, marketing and operational strategies. There are many such elements. The author has reviewed the popular use of the term online business models and found that just five of the key elements can put almost all of them into proper perspective.FindingsFive elements of the business and marketing strategies constitute a practical guide for understanding, discussing and even designing the first working draft of a business plan.Practical implicationsThe practical guide will serve as a robust vehicle for understanding, discussing and even designing the first working draft of a business plan. The current haphazard use of the term online business models does not shed light on online business models.Originality/valueThe author has examined 20 top Google search results for \u201conline business models\u201d and \u201cbusiness models\u201d.

        "abstract": "Alcoholic liver diseases often evolve to acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which increases the risk of (multi-)organ failure and death. We investigated the development and characteristics of alcohol-related ACLF and evaluated prognostic scores for prediction of mortality in Asian patients with active alcoholism.A total of 205 patients who were hospitalized with severe alcoholic liver disease were included in this retrospective cohort study, after excluding those with serious cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, or co-existing viral hepatitis. The Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) Consortium Organ Failure score was used in the diagnosis and grading of ACLF, and the CLIF Consortium ACLF score (CLIF-C ACLFs) was used to predict mortality.Patients with ACLF had higher Maddrey discriminant function, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), and MELD-sodium scores than those without ACLF. Infections were more frequently documented in patients with ACLF (33.3% vs 53.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.004). Predictive factors for ACLF development were systemic inflammatory response syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 2.239; P\u2009u003c\u20090.001), serum sodium level (OR, 0.939; P\u2009=\u20090.029), and neutrophil count (OR, 1.000; P\u2009=\u20090.021). For prediction of mortality at predefined time points (28-day and 90-day) in patients with ACLF, areas under the receiver-operating characteristic were significantly greater for the CLIF-C ACLFs than for Child-Pugh, MELD, and MELD-sodium scores.Infection and systemic inflammatory response syndrome play an important role in the development of alcohol-related ACLF in Asian patients with active alcoholism. The CLIF-C ACLFs may be more useful for predicting mortality in ACLF cases than liver-specific scoring systems.",

        "abstract": "Koreans are generally considered a Northeast Asian group, thought to be related to Altaic-language-speaking populations. However, recent findings have indicated that the peopling of Korea might have been more complex, involving dual origins from both southern and northern parts of East Asia. To understand the male lineage history of Korea, more data from informative genetic markers from Korea and its surrounding regions are necessary. In this study, 25 Y-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphism markers and 17 Y-chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci were genotyped in 1,108 males from several populations in East Asia.In general, we found East Asian populations to be characterized by male haplogroup homogeneity, showing major Y-chromosomal expansions of haplogroup O-M175 lineages. Interestingly, a high frequency (31.4%) of haplogroup O2b-SRY465 (and its sublineage) is characteristic of male Koreans, whereas the haplogroup distribution elsewhere in East Asian populations is patchy. The ages of the haplogroup O2b-SRY465 lineages (~9,900 years) and the pattern of variation within the lineages suggested an ancient origin in a nearby part of northeastern Asia, followed by an expansion in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula. In addition, the coalescence time (~4,400 years) for the age of haplogroup O2b1-47z, and its Y-STR diversity, suggest that this lineage probably originated in Korea. Further studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to cover the vast East Asian region and using genomewide genotyping should provide further insights.These findings are consistent with linguistic, archaeological and historical evidence, which suggest that the direct ancestors of Koreans were proto-Koreans who inhabited the northeastern region of China and the Korean Peninsula during the Neolithic (8,000-1,000 BC) and Bronze (1,500-400 BC) Ages.",

        "abstract": "We extensively reviewed the macrozoobenthos around Dokdo, Korea, by analyzing metadata collected over the past 50years. The Dokdo macrozoobenthos was represented by 578 species belonging to 243 families from 12 phyla, where four major phyla (or classes) collectively accounted for 86% to total. Mollusks, arthropods, and cnidarians were semi-equally occurred in intertidal and subtidal areas, while polychetes dominated the subtidal zone. The northern most region of Dokdo had the greatest biodiversity (173 species). The taxonomic distinctness analysis (delta+) indicated a close association between species by region, although the number of species varied greatly. About half of the species did not occur cross the locations (n=20), indicating strong habitat preferences of Dokdo macrofaunal assemblages. Overall, the diversity of Dokdo was greater than that of Ulleung Island (east coast), but comparable to that of the well-developed tidal flats in the western Korean waters, highlighting its status as a biodiversity hotspot.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation has important biological roles, such as gene expression regulation, as well as practical applications in forensics, such as in body fluid identification and age estimation. DNA methylation often occurs in the CpG site, and methylation within the CpG islands affects various cellular functions and is related to tissue-specific identification. Several programs have been developed to identify CpG islands; however, the size, location, and number of predicted CpG islands are not identical due to different search algorithms. In addition, they only provide structural information for predicted CpG islands without experimental information, such as primer design. We developed an analysis pipeline package, CpGPNP, to integrate CpG island prediction and primer design. CpGPNP predicts CpG islands more accurately and sensitively than other programs, and designs primers easily based on the predicted CpG island locations. The primer design function included standard, bisulfite, and methylation-specific PCR to identify the methylation of particular CpG sites. In this study, we performed CpG island prediction on all chromosomes and compared CpG island search performance of CpGPNP with other CpG island prediction programs. In addition, we compared the position of primers designed for a specific region within the predicted CpG island using other bisulfite PCR primer programs. The primers designed by CpGPNP were used to experimentally verify the amplification of the target region of markers for body fluid identification and age estimation. CpGPNP is freely available at http://forensicdna.kr/cpgpnp/.",

Therefore, a well-organized and curated database is essential to meet this need.

However, BOLD does not contain all of the barcode information available in other databases such as GenBank and the Korea Barcode Of Life database (KBOL).

Eupatilin (5,7-dihydroxy-3,4,6-trimethoxyflavone) is a pharmacologically active ingredient found in Artemisia asiatica and exhibits cytoprotective effects against experimentally induced gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and hepatic damage. This\n study was undertaken to examine if eupatilin modulates bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis.\n \n \n \n Methods\u00a0\u00a0Huh-BAT cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line stably transfected with a bile acid transporter, were used in this\n study. Apoptosis was quantified using 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining, and its signaling cascades were\n explored by immunoblot analysis. Kinase signaling was evaluated by immunoblotting and by using selective inhibitors. Eupatilin's\n in vivo effect on bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was explored in bile duct-ligated rats.\n \n \n \n Results\u00a0\u00a0Eupatilin significantly reduced bile acid-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis by attenuating bile acid-induced caspase 8 cleavage.\n Eupatilin diminished the bile acid-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, including p38 mitogen-activated\n protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In particular, the eupatilin-mediated inhibition of bile acid-induced c-Jun N-terminal\n kinase activation was found to be responsible for attenuating caspase 8 cleavage. Moreover, eupatilin diminished hepatocyte\n apoptosis in bile duct-ligated rats.\n \n \n \n Conclusions\u00a0\u00a0Eupatilin attenuates bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis by suppressing bile acid-induced kinase activation. Therefore,\n eupatilin might be therapeutically efficacious in a variety of human liver diseases associated with cholestasis.",

        "abstract": "To optimize management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a simple screening tool is necessary. In this study, we aimed to devise a simple index of NAFLD.A cross-sectional study with 10,724 health check-up subjects (5362 cases with NAFLD versus age- and sex-matched controls) was conducted. Study subjects were randomly assigned to a derivation cohort or a validation cohort.Multivariate analysis indicated that high serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ratio, high body mass index (BMI), and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors of NAFLD (all P<0.001). Using these variables, a formula was derived by a logistic regression model: hepatic steatosis index (HSI)= 8 x(ALT/AST ratio)+BMI (+2, if female; +2, if diabetes mellitus). HSI had an area under receiver-operating curve of 0.812 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.824). At values of <30.0 or >36.0, HSI ruled out NAFLD with a sensitivity of 93.1%, or detected NAFLD with a specificity of 92.4%, respectively. Of 2692 subjects with HSI <30.0 or >36.0 in the derivation cohort, 2305 (85.6%) were correctly classified. HSI was validated in the subsequent validation cohort.HSI is a simple, efficient screening tool for NAFLD that may be utilized for selecting individuals for liver ultrasonography and for determining the need for lifestyle modifications.",

        "abstract": "DNA barcoding provides a rapid, accurate, and standardized method for species-level identification using short DNA sequences. Such a standardized identification method is useful for mapping all the species on Earth, particularly when DNA sequencing technology is cheaply available. There are many nations in Asia with many biodiversity resources that need to be mapped and registered in databases.We have built a general DNA barcode data processing system, BioBarcode, with open source software - which is a general purpose database and server. It uses mySQL RDBMS 5.0, BLAST2, and Apache httpd server. An exemplary database of BioBarcode has around 11,300 specimen entries (including GenBank data) and registers the biological species to map their genetic relationships. The BioBarcode database contains a chromatogram viewer which improves the performance in DNA sequence analyses.Asia has a very high degree of biodiversity and the BioBarcode database server system aims to provide an efficient bioinformatics protocol that can be freely used by Asian researchers and research organizations interested in DNA barcoding. The BioBarcode promotes the rapid acquisition of biological species DNA sequence data that meet global standards by providing specialized services, and provides useful tools that will make barcoding cheaper and faster in the biodiversity community such as standardization, depository, management, and analysis of DNA barcode data. The system can be downloaded upon request, and an exemplary server has been constructed with which to build an Asian biodiversity system http://www.asianbarcode.org.",

However, to reduce the long-term drawbacks of ivHBIG, we evaluated the efficacy of sequential entecavir (ETV) monotherapy.Twenty-nine candidates with HBV-related liver disease were prospectively enrolled. The patients were selected if the patient was suitable for one of the following inclusion criteria: (1) NA-na\u00efve patients except for ETV, and (2) negative HB e antigen (HBeAg) and undetectable HBV DNA at the time of LT. Post-LT HBV prophylaxis consisted of 1-year combination therapy with ETV (0.5 mg daily) plus ivHBIG per 5 weeks, followed by ETV monotherapy. The primary endpoint was the 2-year recurrence rate of HB. The median follow-up period was 31 months.At the time of transplantation, HBeAg was positive in 21% and HBV DNA was detectable in 52% of the study participants. No HBV recurrence was reported during the first year. During the second year, HBV recurrence was noted in one who suffered from HCC recurrence without viral mutation. Recurrence free survival rates were 96.6 and 96.4% at 1- and 2-year post-transplant by intention-to-treat analysis. One patient died of fungal infection.Sequential ETV monotherapy after 1-year combination therapy might be safe in NA-na\u00efve replicators as well as non-replicators.",

        "abstract": "The pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causative agent of pine wilt disease, which has caused heavy economic losses to the South Korean forest industry.\n In this study, we investigated the genetic variation among South Korean pinewood nematodes using newly developed microsatellite\n loci. In order to ensure sufficient templates for the amplification of multiple loci required for individual identification,\n we employed an amplifying step of restricted fragments during the microsatellite development procedure. We found atypical\n genetic patterns in this non-native pest species: high allelic diversity and population structure. The large number of alleles\n may be the result of continuous and/or large-scaled introduction, which apparently went unnoticed before the first official\n report of pine wilt disease in Korea in 1998, or may come from gene pools of closely related species through genetic introgression\n after hybridization. Ecological properties of this species, such as a vector-mediated life cycle, may have contributed to\n its population structure, which may be enhanced by governmental efforts to prevent dispersal of this disease. As a geographic\n population structure was not observed, geographic patterns of genetic variation appear to be more affected by anthropogenic\n mediation than by natural dispersion through vector insects. And genotypes of Korean populations were compared to genotypes\n found in neighboring countries such as China and Japan.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in molecular techniques has generated a wealth of information for phylogenetic analysis. Among metazoans all but a single phylum have been incorporated into some sort of molecular analysis. However, the minute and rare species of the phylum Loricifera have remained elusive to molecular systematists. Here we report the first molecular sequence data (nearly complete 18S rRNA) for a member of the phylum Loricifera, Pliciloricus sp. from Korea. The new sequence data were analyzed together with 52 other ecdysozoan sequences, with all other phyla represented by three or more sequences. The data set was analyzed using parsimony as an optimality criterion under direct optimization as well as using a Bayesian approach. The parsimony analysis was also accompanied by a sensitivity analysis. The results of both analyses are largely congruent, finding monophyly of each ecdysozoan phylum, except for Priapulida, in which the coelomate Meiopriapulus is separate from a clade of pseudocoelomate priapulids. The data also suggest a relationship of the pseudocoelomate priapulids to kinorhynchs, and a relationship of nematodes to tardigrades. The Bayesian analysis placed the arthropods as the sister group to a clade that includes tardigrades and nematodes. However, these results were shown to be parameter dependent in the sensitivity analysis. The position of Loricifera was extremely unstable to parameter variation, and support for a relationship of loriciferans to any particular ecdysozoan phylum was not found in the data.",

        "abstract": "The parasitic Platyhelminthes (Neodermata) contains three parasitic groups of flatworms, each having a unique morphology, and life style: Monogenea (primarily ectoparasitic), Trematoda (endoparasitic flukes), and Cestoda (endoparasitic tapeworms). The evolutionary origin of complex life cyles (multiple obligate hosts, as found in Trematoda and Cestoda) and of endo-/ecto-parasitism in these groups is still under debate and these questions can be resolved, only if the phylogenetic position of the Monogenea within the Neodermata clade is correctly estimated.To test the interrelationships of the major parasitic flatworm groups, we estimated the phylogeny of the Neodermata using complete available mitochondrial genome sequences and a newly characterized sequence of a polyopisthocotylean monogenean Microcotyle sebastis. Comparisons of inferred amino acid sequences and gene arrangement patterns with other published flatworm mtDNAs indicate Monogenea are sister group to a clade of Trematoda+Cestoda.Results confirm that vertebrates were the first host for stem group neodermatans and that the addition of a second, invertebrate, host was a single event occurring in the Trematoda+Cestoda lineage. In other words, the move from direct life cycles with one host to complex life cycles with multiple hosts was a single evolutionary event. In association with the evolution of life cycle patterns, our result supports the hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor of the Neodermata giving rise to the Monogenea adopted vertebrate ectoparasitism as its initial life cycle pattern and that the intermediate hosts of the Trematoda (molluscs) and Cestoda (crustaceans) were subsequently added into the endoparasitic life cycles of the Trematoda+Cestoda clade after the common ancestor of these branched off from the monogenean lineage. Complex life cycles, involving one or more intermediate hosts, arose through the addition of intermediate hosts and not the addition of a vertebrate definitive host. Additional evidence is required from monopisthocotylean monogeneans in order to confirm the monophyly of the group.",

        "abstract": "In cholestatic liver diseases, bile acids induce hepatocyte apoptosis and thus cause liver injury, but hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) survive in the presence of bile acids. We attempted to analyze anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in HSCs against bile acid-induced apoptosis. In immortalized human HSCs and primarily cultured rat HSCs, bile acid treatment increased the expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Mcl-1. COX-2 induction was found to be due to transcriptional enhancement dependent on p42/44, p38 MAPK, and JNK activation, whereas Mcl-1 induction resulted from bile acid-mediated protein stabilization in a Raf-1-dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibitions of either COX-2 activity by celecoxib or Mcl-1 induction by siRNA transfection rendered HSCs susceptible to bile acid-induced apoptosis. These results imply that the bile acid-mediated inductions of COX-2 and Mcl-1 may lead to HSC survival in cholestatic liver diseases.",

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new diagnostic kit, which quantitatively measures serum HBsAg level using an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)-based method. Measurements were compared with those obtained using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)-based method.The blood samples of 96 patients with chronic hepatitis B were used in this study. Copy numbers of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were determined in 23 of these samples. The correlation between and the concordance of IRMA and CMIA results were determined using Pearson's correlation coefficients. P values of 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant throughout.Laboratory diagnoses based on IRMA were wholly in agreement with those based on CMIA. Furthermore, serum HBsAg levels by IRMA were found to be highly correlated with those determined by CMIA (correlation coefficient R (2) = 0.838, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Serum HBsAg level and serum HBV DNA copies were found to be linearly related by both methods (R (2) = 0.067, p\u2009=\u20090.316 by IRMA, and R (2) = 0.101, p\u2009=\u20090.215 by CMIA).The diagnostic performance of the investigated IRMA method of determining HBsAg levels was found to be comparable with that of a CMIA-based method in chronic hepatitis B patients.",

For molecular identification, there are several approaches available\n based on varying properties such as sequence similarity, length of PCR products, and hybridization. We previously developed\n web-based Molecular Identification System for Fish (MISF), including 53 Korean freshwater fish species, based on a profile\n hidden Markov model and sequence similarity. In this study, we developed a DNA chip arrayed with 16 oligonucleotide probes\n to identify 11 selected species of Korean freshwater fish. The COI gene was quite suitable for designing species-specific oligonucleotide probes and a DNA chip arrayed with these probes showed\n high resolution for species identification. Therefore, the DNA chip using the COI gene can be further developed for different purposes by optimal species selection in biodiversity studies and environmental\n monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant cancers closely associated with chronic infection by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) throughout the world. Differential expression of the proteome in HBV- and HCV-associated HCC was investigated to identify any useful biomarkers indicating virus-specific hepatocarcinogenesis.Twenty-one pairs of specimens (tumorous and surrounding nontumorous liver tissues) were obtained from 21 HCC patients. They were divided into three HCC types by viral markers: 7 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (B-type HCC), 7 anti-HCV-positive (C-type HCC), and 7 hepatitis B surface antigen-negative and anti-HCV-negative. Total proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and alterations in the proteome were examined.Sixty proteins were identified that show significant changes in the expression level between nontumorous and tumorous tissues. Among these, 14 proteins were commonly changed in all three of the HCC types, but 46 proteins showed a tendency of viral marker specificity.The identified proteins were classified according to the viral factor as being involved in B-type and C-type HCC. These results suggest strongly that the expression pattern of proteome in HCC tissues is closely associated with etiologic factors. The different protein profiles between B-type and C-type HCC indicate that the pathogenetic mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis may be different according to the viral factor, HBV and HCV.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by hypervascularity and chemoresistance. Protein kinase C (PKC) participates in cancer progression by enhancing anti-apoptotic signals, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. Statins have a selective anti-cancer effect due to over-expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) in cancer cells, but statins may also activate PKC. Thus, we hypothesized that simultaneous treatment with statin and PKC inhibitor might synergistically enhance their anti-tumor efficacies against HCCs.Hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth was assessed using MTS assays, apoptotic cell death by DAPI staining, and apoptotic signaling cascades were explored by immunoblotting. An in vivo model of HCC was established in C3H mice intradermally implanted with MH134 cells. Lovastatin and/or a PKC inhibitor (enzastaurin) was subsequently administered. Anti-tumor efficacies were evaluated by measuring tumor volumes and quantifying apoptotic cells and microvessel densities (MVD).Co-treatment with lovastatin and enzastaurin was found to synergistically suppress HCC cell growth in vitro. Lovastatin induced HCC cellular apoptosis by activating mitochondrial apoptotic signals, and although enzastaurin alone did not induce apoptosis, its addition significantly enhanced lovastatin-induced apoptosis. This enhanced apoptosis was attributed to increased caspase-9 activation in these cells. Moreover, tumor growth was significantly suppressed in mice co-treated with lovastatin and enzastaurin, and percentages of TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased and MVDs were significantly decreased in those mice.Combinatorial treatment with statin and PKC inhibitor was found to enhance anti-tumor efficacy in vivo and in vitro. Further studies are warranted to prove anti-tumor efficacy of this potential therapy in human HCCs.",

        "abstract": "Seasonal changes in community structure and reproductive status of phytal harpacticoid copepods in the shallow sublittoral bottom at two sites (Masan-ri and Guryongpo) in Pohang (Korea) are described monthly over a period of 1 year (October 1996 to September 1997). A total of 36 harpacticoid species was identified and the numerically dominant copepods were made up of the families Porcellidiidae and Tisbidae. Although the number of species did not show a seasonal trend, total harpacticoid density revealed a favorable distribution for the warmer season (spring and summer) at both sites. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that univariate indices such as density, evenness and diversity are closely associated with certain environmental parameters. For example, the dominant species fluctuated seasonally in abundance and their maximum densities were found to be temperature- (+ with Porcellidium ofunatense ) and nutrient-dependent (+ with Scutellidium longicauda acheloides , + with Zaus unisetosus , and \u2212 with P. wandoensis ). In addition, the dominant species appeared to breed year round and their reproductive indices are significantly correlated with some environmental parameters such as temperature (\u2212), pH (+), and phosphate (+). Three species ( S. l. acheloides , P. wandoensis , and P. ofunatense ) showed maximum density two or three months after their reproductive activity reached a maximum. Overall, the seasonal changes in a phytal harpacticoid community could be explained by combinations of environmental parameters supporting the complexity and biodiversity for this specific group of species in coastal ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of cell surface receptors and play a central role in cellular signaling pathways. The importance of GPCRs has led to their becoming the targets of more than 50% of prescription drugs. However, drug compounds that do not differentiate between receptor subtypes can have considerable side effects and efficacy problems. An accurate classification of GPCRs can solve the side effect problems and raise the efficacy of drugs. Here, we introduce an approach that combines a fingerprint method, statistical profiles and physicochemical properties of transmembrane (TM) domains for a highly accurate classification of the receptors. The approach allows both the recognition and classification for GPCRs at the subfamily and subtype level, and allows the identification of splice variants. We found that the approach demonstrates an overall accuracy of 97.88% for subfamily classification, and 94.57% for subtype classification.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the origin of Koreans, we examined the 12-locus Y-chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) variation in a sample\n of 310 unrelated males from three localities (Gochang, Andong and Geoje) in Korea and statistically analyzed the previously\n published four Y-STR databases (n = 1655) of Korean population. The median joining network of 9-locus Y-STR haplotypes inferred as haplogroup O2b-SRY+465 showed a \u201cstar cluster\u201d indicative of a population expansion from a centrally positioned haplotype. The central haplotype\n in the \u201cstar cluster\u201d was the most frequently occurring Y-STR haplotype among the Korean male gene pool (6%, 127 of 1965,\n 10,14,12,13,14,16,13,13,23, for loci DYS391, DYS389I, DYS439, DYS438, DYS437, DYS19, DYS392, DYS393, and DYS390), which was\n shared among all seven datasets. Based on the \u201cstar cluster\u201d pattern from both our data (41%, 128 of 310) and those previously\n published (34%, 563 of 1655), we suggest that the most frequent Y-STR haplotype among the Korean male gene pool seems to be\n the Korean modal (ancestral) haplotype. Further study with additional Y-STR and Y-SNP data of the east Asian populations as\n well as Korean population are needed to providing a genetic clue for the \u201cstar cluster\u201d (O2b-SRY+465) associated with the ethnohistoric events of the Koreans.",

This new species is distinguishable from P. cultrifera and other similar species such as P. floridana ( Ehlers, 1868 ) (type locality: USA), P. anderssoni Kinberg, 1866 (type locality: Brazil), and P. helleri ( Grube, 1878 ) (type locality: Philippines) by the character combination of the absence of lateral group of paragnaths in area III on the proboscis, the presence of small notopodial prechaetal lobe in anterior parapodia, and the greatly expanded dorsal ligule in posterior parapodia. All previous records of \"P. cultrifera\" from eastern Asia (Taiwan, China, Japan, and Korea) are judged to belong to P. euiini sp. nov., leading to the conclusion that P. cultrifera is not a cosmopolitan species. Specimens previously identified as P. cultrifera var. floridana (or P. cultrifera floridana) in eastern Asia are also judged to belong to P. euiini sp. nov., although they have different paragnath number in area V (one instead of three). Their aberrant paragnath number was regarded as an intraspecific variation of P. euiini sp. nov. The comparison of DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) between P. euiini sp. nov. and \"P. cultrifera\" from China and Portugal also supports the erection of the new species.",

        "abstract": "Impaired nutrient sensing and dysregulated glucose homeostasis are common in diabetes. However, how nutrient-sensitive signaling components control glucose homeostasis and \u03b2 cell survival under diabetic stress is not well understood. Here, we show that mice lacking the core nutrient-sensitive signaling component mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in \u03b2 cells exhibit reduced \u03b2 cell mass and smaller islets. mTOR deficiency leads to a severe reduction in \u03b2 cell survival and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in chemical-induced diabetes. Mechanistically, we find that mTOR associates with the carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP)-Max-like protein complex and inhibits its transcriptional activity, leading to decreased expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a potent inducer of \u03b2 cell death and oxidative stress. Consistent with this, the levels of TXNIP and ChREBP were highly elevated in human diabetic islets and -deficient mouse islets. Thus, our results suggest that a nutrient-sensitive mTOR-regulated transcriptional network could be a novel target to improve \u03b2 cell survival and glucose homeostasis in diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The native ranges and invasion histories of many marine species remain elusive due to a dynamic dispersal process via marine vessels. Molecular markers can aid in identification of native ranges and elucidation of the introduction and establishment process. The supralittoral isopod  has a wide tropical and subtropical distribution, frequently found in harbors and ports around the globe. This isopod is hypothesized to have an Old World origin, from where it was unintentionally introduced to other regions via wooden ships and solid ballast. Its native range, however, remains uncertain. Recent molecular studies uncovered the presence of two highly divergent lineages of  in East Asia, and suggest this region is a source of nonindigenous populations. In this study, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian) of a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal (r)DNA gene using a dataset of this isopod that greatly expanded previous representation from Asia and putative nonindigenous populations around the world. For a subset of samples, sequences of 12S rDNA and NaK were also obtained and analyzed together with 16S rDNA. Our results show that  is comprised of several highly divergent genetic lineages, which probably represent different species. Most of the 16S rDNA genetic diversity (48 haplotypes) was detected in East and Southeast Asia. Only seven haplotypes were observed outside this region (in the Americas, Hawai'i, Africa and India), which were identical or closely related to haplotypes found in East and Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic patterns indicate the  clade originated and diversified in East and Southeast Asia, and only members of one of the divergent lineages have spread out of this region, recently, suggesting the potential to become invasive is phylogenetically constrained.",

Although biallelic patterns due to duplication events have been detected at some loci, Y-STRs generally appear as a single peak except for DYS385 because the Y chromosome is haploid. STR loci in regions of segmental duplication by homologous recombination on the Y chromosome exhibit double allelic peaks, rather than single peaks. In this study, we report a bi- and triallelic pattern observed simultaneously in DYS390, DYS518, and DYS643. A bi- and triallelic pattern has not previously been observed simultaneously for these three loci. We also identified the copy number variation in the region including these loci by the microarray-based analysis. Given the peak balance pattern, the copy number variation, and the close position of these three loci on the Y chromosome, we consider that this phenomenon is caused by a segmental duplication in the euchromatin region. By ruling out mixed samples, a common interpretation of multiple peaks, these results have practical implications for the interpretation of Y-STR results in forensics analyses.",

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) often accompanies alcoholic hepatitis (AH). The study aimed to investigate clinical characteristics of GIB in AH patients and to identify risk factors for mortality in AH patients with GIB.Data from 329 patients hospitalized with AH in a single center during 1999-2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with AH were dichotomized into GIB and non-GIB groups. The GIB group was further divided into portal hypertensive bleeding (PHB) and non-PHB groups. Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between the groups. Risk factors for mortality were analyzed using Cox regression.Among the 329 AH patients, 132 experienced GIB at admission or during hospitalization. The most common cause of GIB was an esophageal varix. The GIB group had worse survival outcomes than the non-GIB group (log-rank test, P\u2009=\u20090.034). The PHB group had worse survival outcomes than the non-PHB group (log-rank test, P\u2009=\u20090.001). On multivariate analysis, alcohol consumption, ascites, encephalopathy, infection, Maddreyu0027s discriminant function, and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score independently predicted mortality in the entire AH cohort. The MELD score (hazard ratio, 1.085; 95% confidence interval, 1.052-1.120; P\u2009u003c\u20090.001) and PHB (hazard ratio, 2.162; 95% confidence interval, 1.021-4.577; P\u2009=\u20090.044) were significant prognosticators for patients with AH and GIB.The presence of PHB and a higher MELD score adversely affected survival in AH patients with GIB. Accordingly, prompt endoscopic examination for exploring the etiologies of GIB may alert physicians to predict the risk of death in AH patients with GIB.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether individuals with NAFLD have an elevated risk of CHD, as estimated using the Framingham risk score (FRS).A total of 21,130 individuals who underwent a voluntary general health examination were recruited. NAFLD was diagnosed among these individuals on the basis of typical sonographic findings and a level of alcohol consumption of <20 g/day. Of the 21,130 individuals, 3,780 were excluded because they had known causes of liver disease (1,690 were alcoholics, 975 had hepatitis B virus, 242 had hepatitis C virus, 91 had other hepatitis history, and 593 were taking medication known to produce fatty liver) or a history of heart disease (189).NAFLD was diagnosed in 5,769 of the 17,350 individuals (33.3%). The 11,581 normal individuals constituted the control group. The 5,769 individuals with NAFLD were split into two groups on the basis of ultrasonographic findings, that is, into a mild NAFLD group (n=3,278) and a moderate-severe NAFLD group (n=2,491). Individuals with NAFLD had an elevated risk of CHD, as estimated using FRS. Multivariable regression analysis, adjusted for confounding factors, showed a strong association between a higher FRS and NAFLD.Individuals with ultrasonographically detected NAFLD have an elevated 10-year risk of developing CHD as estimated using FRS. Furthermore, NAFLD was found to be independently related to the risk of developing CHD, regardless of classical risk factors and other components of MS.",

PTKs represent a diverse family of proteins including both receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Due to the diversity and important cellular roles of PTKs, accurate classification methods are required to better understand and differentiate different PTKs. In addition, PTKs have become important targets for drugs, providing a further need to develop novel methods to accurately classify this set of important biological molecules. Here, we introduce a novel statistical model for the classification of PTKs that is based on their structural features. The approach allows for both the recognition of PTKs and the classification of RTKs into their subfamilies. This novel approach had an overall accuracy of 98.5% for the identification of PTKs, and 99.3% for the classification of RTKs.",

From this species, we isolated 9 polymorphic microsatellites, which are independent of each other and represent allele frequencies under the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, except for 1 locus. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 7 to 20. The expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.77 to 0.96 and from 0.63 to 0.95, respectively. We also examined cross-species amplification of the 9 developed microsatellite loci in 2 other crabs designated as endangered species in Korea and 6 sesarmid crabs, which live in habitats similar to that of S. intermedius. These markers have the potential to contribute to establishing conservation plans for this endangered crab species.",

The mitogenome of P. uschakovi is 15,540\u2009bp in length. It has 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a non-coding region. Mitogenome analysis of P. uschakovi showed inversion in the positions of three tRNAs compared to the mitogenome sequences of Perinereis aibuhitensis, P. nuntia and Platynereis dumerilii. The phylogenetic position of P. uschakovi compared to 15 selected polychaetes was investigated. P. uschakovi was grouped into the family of Nereididae. It is closely related to the clade containing Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus and Namalycastis abiuma.",

We evaluated if adrenomedullin signaling is active in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially under hypoxic conditions, and to analyze its prognostic implication in HCC patients. HCC cells expressed adrenomedullin and its receptor, and hypoxia induced adrenomedullin expression. Adrenomedullin stimulated HCC cell growth via Akt activation, which was prevented by adrenomedullin peptide inhibitor. Clinico-pathological analysis revealed adrenomedullin extent was related to vascular invasion and N-cadherin intensity, which were reported to indicate a poor prognosis. In conclusion, adrenomedullin signaling is hypoxia-inducible and functionally active in HCCs, and its expression may be a prognostic factor.",

Thus, we determined if Wnt signaling modulates hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and survival. Wnt3A treatment significantly activated human HSCs, while this was inhibited in secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) overexpressing cells. Wnt3A treatment significantly suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis in control HSCs versus sFRP1 over-expressing cells. Particularly, caspase 3 was more activated in sFRP1 over-expressing cells following TRAIL and Wnt3A treatment. These observations imply that Wnt signaling promotes hepatic fibrosis by enhancing HSC activation and survival.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate histomorphological and immunophenotypic features in pill-induced esophagitis. We comparatively evaluated the histomorphological, immunophenotypic features of pill-induced esophagitis vs. reflux esophagitis, as well as clinical information and endoscopic findings. Fifty-two tissue pieces from 22 cases of pill-induced esophagitis, 46 pieces from 20 reflux esophagitis, and 16 pieces from 14 control samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry for inflammatory infiltrates (CD3 for T lymphocyte, CD20 for B lymphocyte, CD56 for NK cell, CD68 for macrophage, CD117 for mast cell) and eosinophil chemotaxis-associated proteins (Erk, leptin, leptin receptor, pSTAT3, phospho-mTOR). As a result, Histomorphology showed that a diffuse pattern of dilated intercellular spaces was more frequently observed in pill-induced esophagitis, while reactive atypia and subepithelial papillary elongation were more often found in reflux esophagitis (P < 0.05, respectively). Interestingly, intraepithelial eosinophilic microabscess, intraepithelial pustule and diffuse pattern of dilated intercellular spaces were observed in 14% (3 cases), 9% (2 cases) and 32% (7 cases) of pill-induced esophagitis, respectively, but in no cases of reflux esophagitis. Regarding intraepithelial inflammatory infiltrates in pill-induced esophagitis, T lymphocytes were the most common cells, followed by eosinophil; 11 and 7 in one x400 power field, respectively. Intraepithelial pSTAT3-positive pattern was more frequently observed in pill-induced esophagitis than in reflux esophagitis, at 45% (10 cases) versus 10% (2 cases), respectively (P < 0.05). Considering the distal esophageal lesion only, intraepithelial pustule, diffuse dilated intercellular spaces and stromal macrophages were more frequently found in distal pill-induced esophagitis, whereas reactive atypia and intraepithelial mast cells in reflux esophagitis (P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, diffuse dilated intercellular spaces, intraepithelial eosinophil microabscess, pustule, T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and pSTAT3 positivity can be added to histopathological features of pill-induced esophagitis, other than non-specific ulcer. Besides, distal pill-induced esophagitis may be histopathologically differentiated from reflux esophagitis. ",

        "abstract": "The positive role of radiotherapy for patients with lymph node (LN) metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma has recently been reported. The outcome and prognostic factors for these patients were analyzed.Between May 2004 and October 2007, 38 patients with LN metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma underwent radiotherapy. The median age was 59 years (range, 42-81). The radiation dose was 35-56 Gy with a fraction size of 1.8-3 Gy, for a biologically effective dose of 43.75-67.2 Gy(10) (median, 59.0). The median follow-up period was 8 months.The median survival time was 10 months. On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class B (p = .0006), distant metastasis (p = .0095), symptoms related to metastatic LNs (p <.0001), and a biologically effective dose <60 Gy(10) (p = .0042) were significant prognostic factors predicting for poor overall survival. On multivariate analysis after adjustment using the Benjamini and Hochberg (false discovery rate) method, Child-Pugh class B (p = .04095) and the presence of symptoms (p = .04095) were associated with inferior overall survival. When patients were divided into three groups according to these two risk factors, the median survival for patients with no, either, or both risk factors was 20, 7, and 4 months, respectively (p <.0001).Patients with intact liver function and without related symptoms had the best prognosis when undergoing radiotherapy for LN metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Although adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (ALDLT) has shown comparable outcomes to deceased donor liver transplantation, the outcome of patients with a high MELD score (>25) and a small-for-size graft (SFSG<0.8% of graft-to-recipient weight ratio) is not known. For 7 years, 167 consecutive hepatitis B virus-infected recipients underwent ALDLT at our institution. Based on their MELD score without additional score for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the recipients were divided into Group L (low MELD score, n = 105) or Group H (high MELD score, n = 62). To analyze the risk of the graft size, the patients were further stratified as follows: Group Hs (high MELD score and SFSG, n = 11), Hn (high MELD score and normal size graft, n = 51), Ls (low MELD score and SFSG, n = 18), and Ln (low MELD score and normal size graft, n = 87). The primary endpoint was one-year patient survival rate (1-YSR). The mean follow-up period was 32.6 months. The mean MELD scores were 17.1 in Group L and 32.6 in Group H. Group H had more patients with the complications of cirrhosis but less patients with HCC than Group L (p < 0.05). However, major morbidity rates and 1-YSR were similar in comparisons between Group L (46.7% and 86.7%) and H (59.7% and 83.8%) (p > 0.05). 1-YSR was similar among Group Hs (72.7%), Hn (86.3%), Ls (83.3%), and Ln (88.5%) groups (p = 0.278). The multivariate analysis revealed accompanying HCC and the year of transplant were risk factors for poor 1-YSR. However, 1-YSR without HCC patients was also similar in comparisons between group L (90.2%) and H (91.7%) (p = 0.847), and among Group Hs (80.0%), Hn (94.7%), Ls (72.7%), and Ln (96.7%) (p = 0.072). In conclusion, high MELD score (>25) didn't predict 1-YSR in ALDLT. Improvement of the 1-YSR might be affected by center's experience as well as the selection of patients with low risk of recurrence of HCC.",

        "abstract": "Development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex process involving multiple changes in gene expression and usually occurs in the presence of liver cirrhosis. In this research, we observed proteome alterations of three tissue types isolated from livers of HCC patients: normal, cirrhotic, and tumorous tissue. Proteome alterations were observed using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Comparing the tissue types with each other, a significant change in expression level was found in 21 proteins. Of these proteins, sarcosine dehydrogenase, liver carboxylesterase, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase A, and lamin B1 are considered novel HCC marker candidates. In particular, lamin B1 may be considered as a marker for cirrhosis, because its expression level changes considerably in cirrhotic tissue compared with normal tissue. The proteins revealed in this experiment can be used in the future for studies pertaining to hepatocarcinogenesis, or as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for HCC.",

        "abstract": "TGR5 is a novel G protein-coupled cell-surface bile acid receptor. In cholestasis, bile acids induce hepatocyte apoptosis by primarily activating death receptor-mediated signaling. We examined if bile acid-induced TGR5 activation is participating in bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. TGR5 expression and its responsiveness to bile acid were confirmed in human hepatocytes. TGR5 inhibition attenuated bile acid-induced caspase 8 activation, which resulted from reduced bile acid-induced caspase 8 recruited to a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Bile acid-induced c-Jun-N terminal kinase (JNK) activation was dependent on bile acid activation of TGR5. JNK formed complexes with caspase 8, which were reduced following bile acid treatment, but this reduction was prevented when TGR5 or JNK was inhibited. In conclusion, bile acids activate TGR5, which leads to JNK activation and reduced complex formation of JNK with caspase 8, thus facilitating caspase 8 recruitment to DISC. These observations suggest therapeutic applications for TGR5 signaling blockage in cholestasis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The biogeography of freshwater biota in the Korean Peninsula has been affected by recent geological processes and anthropogenic activity. The freshwater prawn,  Palaemon paucidens , can serve as a non-fish model organism suitable for assessing these factors, as it is found in all river systems in the Korean Peninsula and may have been introduced by humans in some regions. In this study, we investigated the geographical distribution of genetic variation and the genetic structure of  P .  paucidens  populations using mitochondrial DNA sequences and genotypes identified from four microsatellite loci. Our results showed that populations from westward-flowing river systems that drain into the Yellow Sea have more genetic diversity than those from southward-flowing river systems, and that the highest genetic variance revealed by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) using both genetic markers was observed in river systems grouped as HAN\u00a0+\u00a0GEUM, NAKDONG\u00a0+\u00a0JEJU, YOUNGSAN, and SEOMJIN. These results suggest that HAN and GEUM, in which freshwater prawn populations have higher levels of genetic diversity, were the most recently isolated river systems from Asian continental systems. Therefore, populations from HAN and GEUM experienced less severe bottlenecks than those from YOUNGSAN and SEOMJIN.",

        "abstract": "In cholestasis, bile acids induce hepatocyte apoptosis, while activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) results in fibrosis. Since transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a critical mediator in this process, we hypothesized that bile acids may participate in TGF-beta-mediated HSC activation in cholestasis. Bile acid treatment increased TGF-beta transcription in hepatocytes, while the total TGF-beta concentration in culture media rapidly decreased following bile acid treatment. Bile acid treatment promptly induced thrombospondin-1 expression in hepatocytes, which is a potent activator of latent TGF-beta, whereas this induction was not observed in bile acid-treated HSCs. HSCs co-cultured with hepatocytes showed a significantly higher level of Smad2 phosphorylation and collagen alpha1 synthesis following bile acid treatment than cells cultured without hepatocytes. Moreover, this enhanced collagen synthesis was significantly inhibited in the presence of TGF-beta receptor inhibitor. These observations imply that bile acids induce thrombospondin-1 expression in hepatocytes, which activates latent TGF-beta leading to HSC activation.",

The PCR amplifications for Y-STR multiplex were performed in reaction volumes of 10 \u03bcl containing 1 \u00d7 GeneAmp PCR Gold \u00ae buffer (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 200 \u03bcM dNTPs (Promega), 0.16 mg/ml BSA (Sigma), 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold \u00ae DNA polymerase, the Y-STR primer mix, and 1 ng DNA template. The Y-STR primer mix contained 1 \u03bcM primer set of DYS522 (fluorescent dye labeled with JOE), 1 \u03bcM DYS533 (Fluorescein), 0.75 \u03bcM DYS549 (Tamra), 0.3 \u03bcM DYS570 (JOE), 1 \u03bcM DYS576 (Fluorescein), and 0.2 \u03bcM DYS643 (Fluorescein). The cycle conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 28 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. Genotyping and sequencing: The PCR products were run on the ABI3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Automatic size calling was performed with GeneMapper \u00ae ID v3.1 and ILS600 (Promega) as the internal size standard. Two samples were directly sequenced using the BigDye \u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) to verify the allele sequence. The Y-STR allele nomenclatures were designated by the number of repeats, according to the DNA commission of the International Society of Forensic Genetics (ISFG) [2] . Quality control: Proficiency testing of Collaborative Testing Service (CTS) was exercised. The same standard DNA 007 was included as internal control for each batch of genotyping. Access to the data: Complete data can be obtained from supplementary data in electronic version of the journal. Analysis of data: Allele frequencies were calculated from the observed haplotypes. The diversity of Y-STR haplotypes was calculated according to Nei [3] . Mutation rate was calculated by the number of mutation per locus per meiosis. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA), R ST values and the corresponding P values were estimated using the Arlequin v3.0 software [4] . Results: Allele frequency and haplotypes are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. Other remarks: Y-STR profiles for standard DNA 007 resulted in 11\u201313\u201313\u201317\u201319\u201311 (DYS522\u2013DYS533\u2013DYS549\u2013DYS570\u2013DYS576\u2013DYS643). Of the 539 Korean male individuals, a total of 375 haplotypes for the 6 Y-STRs were detected. Of these, 293 haplotypes were found in single individuals. The most frequent haplotype was found in 19 individuals. The haplotype diversity for the 6 Y-STRs was 0.9967 and a discrimination capacity was 0.6957. Three novel microvariant alleles at DYS570 were observed in 10 individuals. Microvariant alleles 18.3, 19.3 and 20.3 at DYS570 were not found in other studies including this locus [1,5\u20137] , whereas alleles 13.2, 14.2, 17.2 and 22.2 in DYS570 had been described in a population from Germany, The Netherlands and Turkey [5] . The variant alleles observed at DYS570 have been confirmed by sequencing. A 18.3 allele revealed the irregular repeat unit [TTTC] 13 ttc[TTTC] 5 . Seven 19.3 allele gave the same sequence [TTTC] 14 ttc[TTTC] 5 . And two 20.3 allele showed the same sequence [TTTC] 15 ttc[TTTC] 5 . First deletion process of a T (\u0394 T ), and then divergence through the gain or loss of a repeat unit [TTTC] may give rise to [TTTC] n ttc[TTTC] 5 allele series over the time scale of Korean evolution. The individual with duplicated allele (11\u201312) in DYS643 also have duplicated allele (22\u201323) at DYS390 using popular Y-filer\u2122 kit (Applied Biosystems). According to BLAT ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat ), DYS390 is located within a 15.784 Mb region at Y q 11.221 and DYS643 located within a 15.935 Mb at Y q 11.221 on Y chromosome. The occurrence of the duplicated DYS643 and DYS390 alleles can be explained by simultaneous duplication, because duplicated loci are close to one another (<1 Mb). Duplicated alleles at two Y-STRs (DYS389I\u2013DYS389II or DYS389II\u2013DYS439) within the same individuals occur 7 times among 174 duplication cases in the YHRD database ( http://www.yhrd.org release of November 2007). One haplotype from the YHRD database showed duplications at three Y-STRs (DYS389I\u2013DYS389II\u2013DYS439). Butler et al. observed duplication in up to four Y-STRs (DYS389I\u2013DYS389II\u2013DYS437\u2013DYS439) from a single individual [8] . So far, those duplicated Y-STRs reported are located within the azoospermia factor a ( AZFa ) region at Y q 11.21, therefore, it was suggested that the AZFa region that includes these Y-STRs might have been duplicated together. The present case is in agree with the current criteria of the forensic interpretation of male\u2013male mixtures, because the question of whether locus duplication or two male mixtures can be determined by the context of Y-STRs location along the Y-chromosome. We performed the direct analysis of confirmed 140 father/son pairs with 292 samples (probability > 99.99%) at 6 Y-STRs and one case of mutation occurred at DYS576 with allele 19 mutating to 20. In our study, the locus-specific mutation rate estimates varied between 0 and 6.58 \u00d7 10 \u22123 /locus/generation based on 152 meiosis events per locus. The overall mutation rate in our sample (1.10 \u00d7 10 \u22123 /locus/generation; 95% confidence interval 0.31\u20131.89 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) was not significantly different from that previously reported: 1.57 \u00d7 10 \u22123 /locus/generation [9] , and 2.80 \u00d7 10 \u22123 /locus/generation [10] . The present haplotype data were compared with those available for the same set of 6 Y-STRs from Germany, The Netherlands and Turkish population [5] . Population pairwise comparison showed that the Korean population has significant differences from Berlin ( R ST = 0.00286, P = 0.00901), Dresden ( R ST = 0.00348, P = 0.00000), Hamberg ( R ST = 0.00745, P = 0.00000), Munich ( R ST = 0.00574, P = 0.00000), Rostock ( R ST = 0.00471, P = 0.00000), Sorbs ( R ST = 0.01340, P = 0.00000) in Germany, Dutch population from Leiden ( R ST = 0.00295, P = 0.00000), and Turkish population living in Berlin ( R ST = 0.00341, P = 0.00901). This paper follows the guidelines for publication of population data requested by the journal [2,11] .

        "abstract": "Corals and their associated fauna are extremely diverse in tropical waters and form major reefs. In the high-latitude temperate zone, corals living near their distribution limit are considered marginal communities because they are particularly extremely sensitive to environmental and climatic changes. In this study, we examined the diversity and host usage of coral-associated barnacles on Jeju Island, Korea, the northern coral distribution limit in the East China Sea. In this study, only three coral-associated barnacles-from two genera in two subfamilies-were collected. The Pyrgomatinid barnacles Cantellius arcuatus and Cantellius cf. euspinulosum were found only on the corals Montipora millepora and Alveopora japonica, respectively. The Megatrematinid barnacle Pyrgomina oulastreae, relatively a generalist, was found on Psammocora spp. (both profundacella and albopicta) and Oulastrea crispata corals. The host usage of these three barnacles does not overlap. DNA barcode sequences of the C. arcuatus specimens collected in the present study matched those collected in Kochi in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, suggesting that this species has a wide geographical distribution. C. arcuatus covers a wider host range in Taiwan waters, inhabiting Montipora spp. and Porites spp., which suggests that the host specificity of coral-associated barnacles varies with host availability. C. cf. euspinulosum probably has a very narrow distribution and host usage. The sequences of C. cf. euspinulosum on Jeju Island do not match those of any known sequences of Cantellius barnacles in the Indo-Pacific region. P. oulastreae probably prefers cold water because it has been reported in temperate regions. Coral-associated barnacles in marginal communities have considerably lower diversity than their subtropical and tropical counterparts. When host availability is limited, marginal coral-associated barnacles exhibit higher host specificity than those in subtropical and tropical reef systems.",

        "abstract": "A new species of protosquillid mantis shrimp is described from the coastal waters of Korea and Japan. Chorisquilla orientalis n. sp. is distinguished from congeners by the combination of deep grooves and pits on the dorsal surface of abdominal somite 5, 8-14 spines on lateral margin of the telson, numerous minute dorsal spines on the telson and abdominal somite 6, and large, pyriform submedian bosses on the telson preceded by a small rounded boss. Chorisquilla orientalis is morphologically closest to C. mehtae Erdmann Manning, 1998, from Indonesia, but differs chiefly in the dorsal ornamentation of abdominal somite 6 and the telson and reaches a considerably larger size. Chorisquilla orientalis n. sp. shows developmental changes from juvenile to adult in the shape of the ocular scales and anterior margin of lateral plates of carapace, and in the number of lateral spines on telson. Also, C. mehtae Erdmann Manning, 1998, which, to date has not been adequately illustrated, is redescribed and figured. A key to the Korean gonodactyloids is presented.",

Samples collected from coastal areas of Korea were filtered through a 63 \u00b5m mesh, then their 18S rDNA V4 regions were amplified. High-throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons using Illumina MiSeq and BLAST against the SILVA database showed that a total of 319 eukaryotic Operational Taxonomic Units were identified at the species level. Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Nematoda, and Platyhelminthes and for 92.23% of the total 103 metazoan species belonging to 101 genera, 75 families, and 10 phyla. Of these, several taxa previously unreported to exist in Korea were detected at the family level compared with the integrated database from three main Korean biodiversity DBs (MABIK, KOMBIS, and MRBR). Analysis of beta diversity of the community structure of invertebrates indicated that the composition of marine invertebrates is likely to be affected by habitat type rather than geographical distance. The present study showed that metagenomic high-throughput technology can be used to unravel species diversity and for various studies regarding marine invertebrate community structure.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that mainly bind to the seed sequences located within the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of target genes. They perform an important biological function as regulators of gene expression. Different genes can be regulated by the same miRNA, whilst different miRNAs can be regulated by the same genes. Here, the evolutionary conservation and expression pattern of miR-10a-3p in olive flounder and rock bream was examined. Binding sites (AAAUUC) to seed region of the 3' UTR of target genes were highly conserved in various species. The expression pattern of miR-10a-3p was ubiquitous in the examined tissues, whilst its expression level was decreased in gill tissues infected by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) compared to the normal control. In the case of rock bream, the spleen, kidney, and liver tissues showed dominant expression levels of miR-10a-3p. Only the liver tissues in the rock bream samples infected by the iridovirus indicated a dominant miR-10a-3p expression. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of predicted target genes for miR-10a-3p revealed that multiple genes are related to binding activity, catalytic activity, cell components as well as cellular and metabolic process. Overall the results imply that the miR-10a-3p could be used as a biomarker to detect VHSV infection in olive flounder and iridovirus infection in rock bream. In addition, the data provides fundamental information for further study of the complex interaction between miR-10a-3p and gene expression.",

        "abstract": "Various therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported. However, the rapid clearance of these cells in vivo, difficulties in identifying their therapeutic mechanism of action, and insufficient production levels remain to be resolved. We investigated whether a pioglitazone pre-treatment of MSCs (Pio-MSCs) would stimulate the proliferation of co-cultured tenocytes. Pioglitazone increased the proliferation of MSCs and enhanced the secretion of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and collagen in these cells. We then examined the effects of Pio-MSCs on tenocytes using an indirect transwell culture system. A significant increase in tenocyte proliferation and cell cycle progression was observed in these co-cultures. Significant increases were observed in wound scratch closure by tenocytes from a Pio-MSC co-culture. Pio-MSCs also enhanced the secretion of collagen from tenocytes. A higher mRNA level of collagen type 1 (Col 1) and type 3 (Col 3), scleraxis (Scx), and tenascin C (TnC) was found in the tenocytes in Pio-MSC co-cultures compared with monocultured cells or tenocytes cultured with non-treated MSCs. Our results indicate that pioglitazone enhances the therapeutic effects of MSCs on tendon repair.",

In this study, we identified an Olive flounder ERV (OF-ERV5) using RepeatMasker program, and examined expression pattern of pol gene of OF-ERV5, which indicated the high expression in two kidney samples (head kidney and body kidney). In addition, the 5\u2032LTR sequences of OF-ERV5 are cloned into pGL4.11 vectors to confirm promoter activity. Luciferase assay indicated that the OF-ERV5_LTR showed promoter activity in both HepG2 and HINAE cell lines.

        "abstract": "The venerid clam (Mactra veneriformis Reeve 1854) is one of the main cultured bivalve species in intertidal and shallow subtidal ecosystems along the west coast of Korea. To understand the effects of ocean acidification on the early life stages of Korean clams, we investigated shell growth and abnormality rates and types in the D-shaped, umbonate veliger, and pediveliger stages of the venerid clam M. veneriformis during exposure to elevated seawater pCO2. In particular, we examined abnormal types of larval shell morphology categorized as shell deformations, shell distortions, and shell fissures. Specimens were incubated in seawater equilibrated with bubbled CO2-enriched air at (400\u00b125)\u00d710-6 (ambient control), (800\u00b125)\u00d710-6 (high pCO2), or (1 200\u00b128)\u00d710-6 (extremely high pCO2), the atmospheric CO2 concentrations predicted for the years 2014, 2084, and 2154 (70-year intervals; two human generations), respectively, in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The mean shell lengths of larvae were significantly decreased in the high and extremely high pCO2 groups compared with the ambient control groups. Furthermore, under high and extremely high pCO2 conditions, the cultures exhibited significantly increased abundances of abnormal larvae and increased severity of abnormalities compared with the ambient control. In the umbonate veliger stage of the experimental larvae, the most common abnormalities were shell deformations, distortions, and fissures; on the other hand, convex hinges and mantle protuberances were absent. These results suggest that elevated CO2 exerts an additional burden on the health of M. veneriformis larvae by impairing early development.",

        "abstract": "Branchyuran crabs are the most diverse groups of crustaceans. They are found in most marine habitats such as coral reef, sandy beach, rocky beach, mangroves and seagrass meadows. In this study, we investigated the species composition of branchyuran crabs from ten sampling locations belonging to three habitats (mangrove forest, artificial dykes, sandy beaches) at Duyen Hai town on August (rainy season) and December (dry season) of 2017. Our result supported that, there were 22 species belonging to 10 genera of 6 families presented in the research area. The Ocypodidae family is the most abandon with 45.5% species, following are Grapsidae (22.7%), Sesarmidae (13.6%), Portunidae (9.1%), Matutidae (4.5%) and Xanthidae (4.5%) respectively. Densities of branchyura crabs ranged from 2.0\u00b11.1\u00a0(inds/m2) to\u00a017.2\u00b14.3\u00a0(inds/m2), the Mangrove forest habitat more diversity in species than Sandy beach and Artificial dykes habitat. In analysis following season, the rainy support for more diversity than dry season.\u00a0\u00a0DOI:\u00a0https://doi.org/10.31276/VJSTE.60(4).39-44",

        "abstract": "Esophageal varix and its hemorrhage are serious complications of liver cirrhosis. Recent studies have focused on noninvasive prediction of esophageal varices. We attempted to evaluate the association of liver and spleen stiffness (LS and SS) as measured by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, with the presence and severity of esophageal varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients.We measured LS and SS, along with endoscopic examination of esophageal varices for a total of 125 cirrhotic patients at a single referral hospital in this prospective observational study. The diagnostic utility of noninvasive methods for identifying varices and their bleeding risk was compared, including LS, SS, spleen length, Child-Pugh score, and various serum fibrosis indices.Esophageal varices were present in 77 patients (61.6%). SS was significantly higher in patients with varices than in those without varices (3.58\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.47 vs 3.02\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.49; P\u200au003c\u200a0.001). A tendency toward increasing SS levels was observed with increasing severity of varices (no varix, 3.02\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.49; F1, 3.39\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.51; F2, 3.60\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.42; F3, 3.85\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.37; P\u200au003c\u200a0.001). SS was significantly higher in patients who experienced variceal hemorrhage than in those who did not (3.80\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.36 vs 3.20\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.51; P\u200a=\u200a0.002). An optimal cut-off value of SS for high-risk varices (\u2265F2) or variceal hemorrhage was 3.40\u200am/s.SS was significantly correlated with the presence, severity, and bleeding risk of esophageal varices. Prompt endoscopic evaluation of variceal status and prophylactic measures based on the SS may be warranted for cirrhotic patients.",

        "abstract": "Type I interferons (IFNs) play an important role in antiviral immunity as well as immunopathogenesis of diverse chronic viral infections. However, the precise mechanisms regulating the multifaceted effects of type I IFNs on the immune system and pathological inflammation still remain unclear. In order to assess the immunological dynamics associated with rapid viral clearance in chronic hepatitis C patients during the acute phase of type I IFN therapy, we analyzed multiple parameters of virological and immunological responses in a cohort of 59 Korean hepatitis C patients who received pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin (IFN/RBV). Most of the Korean patients had favorable alleles in the IFN-\u03bb loci for responsiveness to IFN/RBV (i.e., C/C in rs12979860, T/T in rs8099917, and TT/TT in rs368234815). Rapid virological response (RVR) was determined mainly by the hepatitis C virus genotype. Among the cytokines analyzed, higher plasma levels of IL-17A and FGF were observed in non-RVR patients infected with viral genotype 1 and IP-10 was consistently elevated in RVR group infected with genotype 2 during the early phase of antiviral therapy. In addition, these three cytokines were correlated each other, suggesting a functional linkage of the cytokines in antiviral responses during IFN/RBV therapy. A low baseline frequencies of regulatory T cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, but high level of group 2 innate lymphoid cells, in peripheral bloods were also significantly associated with the RVR group, implicating a potential role of the cellular immunity during the early phase of IFN/RBV therapy. Therefore, the immunological programs established by chronic hepatitis C and rapid disruption of the delicate balance by exogenous type I IFN might be associated with the subsequent virological outcomes in chronic hepatitis C patients.",

Species belonging to Discorsopagurus are easily distinguished from other hermit crabs of the family Paguridae by their telsons that lack indentations and other characteristics such as straight abdomens, fused third and fourth abdominal tergites, and symmetrical uropods. Discorsopagurus maclaughlinae and D. tubicola were found to live in a tube made by a polychaete tubeworm. The two species differ in the shape of the posterior margin of the telson, the length of the pereopod, and the presence of setae on the antennal flagellum. Discorsopagurus tubicola is reported for the second time in the world. In this paper, there will be provided plates and descriptions of the two species.",

        "abstract": "The Asian-American population is characterized by remarkable diversity. Studying Asians as an aggregate group may obscure clinically-meaningful heterogeneity. We performed a population-based study using data from the United States (US) National Vital Statistics System. We determined the trends in age-standardized mortality rates for chronic liver disease stratified by etiology among the most populous US-based Asian subgroups (Asian Indians, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and compared it to non-Hispanic whites. Annual percentage change was calculated to determine temporal mortality patterns using joinpoint analysis.Hepatitis C virus-related mortality rates were higher in non-Hispanic whites compared to individual Asian subgroups, but a sharp decline in mortality rates was noted in 2014 among non-Hispanic whites and all Asian subgroups. Age-standardized hepatitis B virus-related mortality rates were higher in all Asian subgroups as compared to non-Hispanic whites in 2016, with the highest mortality among Vietnamese followed by Chinese. Mortality rates for alcoholic liver disease have been steadily trending upwards in all Asian subgroups, with the highest mortality in Japanese. Overall, age-standardized cirrhosis-related mortality rates were highest in non-Hispanic whites, followed by Japanese, and more distantly by Vietnamese and other subgroups. However, hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality rates were higher in most Asian subgroups led by Vietnamese, Japanese and Koreans compared to non-Hispanic whites. In this population-based study utilizing a nationally representative database, we demonstrated a marked heterogeneity in the mortality rates of etiology-specific chronic liver disease among Asian subgroups in the US.

        "abstract": "Prophylactic antiviral therapy is recommended for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients with malignancies who are undergoing systemic chemotherapy. In the present study, we aimed to develop a risk scoring system to guide the selection of prophylactic antiviral agents. In this retrospective analysis, we included consecutive chronic hepatitis B patients who received antiviral prophylaxis for chemotherapy of solid or hematologic malignancies at 3 large-volume hospitals in Korea. The primary endpoint was HBV reactivation. The inverse probability treatment weighting method was used to minimize selection bias in terms of antiviral assignments. A total of 419 patients were enrolled: 129 patients received lamivudine (LAM), 216 received telbivudine (LdT), and 74 received entecavir (ETV), respectively. Of these, 36 patients developed on-treatment HBV reactivation (LAM, 17; LdT, 18; ETV, 1). Multivariate analysis identified 3 independent predictors for reactivation: hepatitis B e antigen-positivity, HBV DNA level, and type of malignancy. Accordingly, a risk scoring system was developed wherein 1 point was assigned for each of the risk factors. HBV reactivation occurred more frequently in the high-risk group (score \u22652) than in the low-risk group (hazards ratio [HR], 14.17; P < 0.001). ETV exhibited superior prophylactic efficacy over LdT or LAM in the high-risk group, whereas no significant difference was noted in the low-risk group. The prognostic scoring system was useful for risk stratification of chemotherapy-related HBV reactivation. High genetic barrier agents appear to be vital for high-risk patients, whereas cost-effectiveness may be more relevant for low-risk patients. This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "Acute hepatitis A (AHA) involves severe CD8 T\u00a0cell-mediated liver injury. Here we showed during AHA, CD8 T\u00a0cells specific to unrelated viruses became activated. Hepatitis A virus (HAV)-infected cells produced IL-15 that induced T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)-independent activation of memory CD8 T\u00a0cells. TCR-independent activation of non-HAV-specific CD8 T\u00a0cells were detected in patients, as indicated by NKG2D upregulation, a marker of TCR-independent T\u00a0cell activation by IL-15. CD8 T\u00a0cells derived from AHA patients exerted innate-like cytotoxicity triggered by activating receptors NKG2D and NKp30 without TCR engagement. We demonstrated that the severity of liver injury in AHA patients correlated with the activation of HAV-unrelated virus-specific CD8 T\u00a0cells and the innate-like cytolytic activity of CD8 T\u00a0cells, but not the activation of HAV-specific T\u00a0cells. Thus, host injury in AHA is associated with innate-like cytotoxicity of bystander-activated CD8 T\u00a0cells, a result with implications for acute viral diseases.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol increases the risk of both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal neoplasia. In this hospital-based case-control and retrospective cohort study, we sought to determine whether development of colorectal neoplasia increases the risk of HCC in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In the phase I case-control analysis, the association between history of colorectal cancer (CRC) and HCC development was assessed in patients with ALD by logistic regression modeling (n\u2009=\u20091,659). In the phase II retrospective cohort analysis, the relative risk of HCC development was compared in ALD patients with respect to the history of CRC by a Cox model (n\u2009=\u20091,184). The history of CRC was significantly associated with HCC in the case-control analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.06-3.15; P\u2009<\u20090.05). ALD patients with CRC had higher risk of developing HCC compared to those without CRC (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 5.48; 95% CI, 1.63-18.36; P\u2009=\u20090.006) in the cohort analysis. Presence of CRC, liver cirrhosis, elevated baseline alpha-fetoprotein level, and low platelet counts were independent predictors of HCC development in ALD patients. Patients with history of CRC had an increased risk of HCC in both cirrhotic (HR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.05-13.34, P\u2009=\u20090.041) and non-cirrhotic (HR, 23.46; 95% CI, 2.81-195.83, P\u2009=\u20090.004) ALD patients. In conclusion, ALD patients with CRC are at increased risk of developing HCC.",

        "abstract": "Thyroid dysfunction (TD) is more likely to occur in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and is particularly associated with interferon (IFN) treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence, outcomes, and risk factors for TD during pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combined therapy in patients with CHC.A total of 242 euthyroid patients with CHC treated with PEG-IFN/RBV were included. Thyroid function and autoantibodies were measured at baseline, and virologic response and thyroid function were assessed every 3 months during therapy.TD developed in 67 patients (27.7%) during the PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. The types of TD were subclinical hypothyroidism (50.7%), hypothyroidism (14.9%), thyroiditis (11.9%), subclinical hyperthyroidism (10.4%), and hyperthyroidism (10.4%). Most of the patients with TD recovered spontaneously; however, seven patients (10.4%) needed thyroid treatment. The sustained virological response rate was higher in patients with TD than those without (65.7% vs. 49.1%, p = 0.02). Baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.96 to 8.77; p < 0.001), presence of the thyroid peroxidase antibody (OR, 8.81; 95% CI, 1.74 to 44.6; p = 0.009), and PEG-IFN\u03b1-2b (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.43 to 6.39; p = 0.004) were independent risk factors for the development of TD.TD developed in 27.7% of patients with CHC during PEG-IFN/RBV treatment, and 10.4% of these patients needed thyroid treatment. TD is associated with a favorable virologic response to PEG-IFN/RBV. Assessment of TSH and thyroid autoantibodies at baseline and close monitoring of thyroid function during PEG-IFN/RBV therapy are necessary for early detection and management of IFN-induced TD.",

Therefore, ATF3 may be a useful biomarker for predicting the progression of NAFLD and the development of T2D.

        "abstract": "Background u0026 Aims  Besifovir dipivoxil maleate (BSV) has activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). We performed a phase 3 study to compare the antiviral efficacy and safety of BSV vs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in patients with chronic HBV infection in Korea.  Methods  We conducted a double-blind, non-inferiority trial of 197 patients with chronic HBV infection at 22 sites in South Korea, from November 2013 through February 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given BSV (150 mg, n\u00a0= 99) or TDF (300 mg, n\u00a0= 98) for 48 weeks. We evaluated virologic responses to therapy (HBV DNA   Results  After 48 weeks of treatment, 80.9% of patients given BSV and 84.9% of patients given TDF met the efficacy endpoint, indicating the non-inferiority of BSV to TDF. At week 96, 87.2% of patients in the BSV\u2013BSV and 85.7% of patients in the TDF\u2013BSV had a virologic response. At week 48, changes in hip and spine BMD differed significantly between the BSV and TDF groups, whereas the estimated glomerular filtration rate in the TDF group was significantly lower than that in the BSV group. However, at 96 weeks, there were no significant differences in BMD and estimated glomerular filtration rate between the BSV-BSV and TDF-BSV groups.  Conclusions  BSV has antiviral efficacy comparable to that of TDF after 48 weeks of treatment, with durable effects for 96 weeks. BSV has a better safety profile than TDF, in terms of bone and renal outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01937806.",

        "abstract": "Abiraterone acetate (AA), a highly potent CYP17A1 inhibitor, has demonstrated marked clinical benefit in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Phase I trials of AA without prednisone showed significant elevation of serum mineralocorticoid concentrations. The aim of this study was to elucidate the biological significance of elevated mineralocorticoid levels on androgen receptor (AR) activity in prostate cancer (PC) cells.Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was used to assess the effect of mineralocorticoids on androgen-induced conformational change of the AR. LAPC4, LNCaP and LN-AR cells that were cultured and treated with androgens were exposed to mineralocorticoids at varying concentrations, including levels measured in the serum of AA-treated patients in a phase I trial. AR-dependent transcriptional activity and cell growth were measured in these cell lines to determine the biological impact of mineralocorticoids on PC cells.Corticosterone (CS) and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) inhibited androgen-induced conformational change of the AR in the FRET assay. CS inhibited AR-dependent transcriptional activity and cell growth at concentrations comparable to those measured in the serum of AA-treated patients. DOC inhibited AR transcriptional activity and cell growth at 10-fold greater concentrations than measured in the serum of AA-treated patients.Mineralocorticoids directly inhibit androgen-induced conformational change of the AR. CS inhibits AR transcriptional activity and PC cell growth at concentrations found in the serum of patients treated with AA. Further investigation of the potential therapeutic implications of mineralocorticoids in AA-treated CRPC patients is warranted.",

This study investigated the clinical benefit of maximization of androgen suppression by increasing the abiraterone acetate dose at the time of initial resistance to standard-dose therapy. Methods: Eligible patients had progressive metastatic CRPC per consensus criteria. No prior abiraterone, enzalutamide, or chemotherapy was allowed. All patients started therapy with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5mg BID. Patients achieving any PSA decline after 3 cycles continued abiraterone until PSA or radiographic progression. At progression the abiraterone acetate dose was increased to 1,000 mg BID, prednisone was maintained at 5mg BID, and patients were monitored for response for a minimum of 12 weeks or until a second PSA or radiogra...",

Mitoxantrone has antitumor activity in mCRPC and nonoverlapping mechanism of action and toxicity profile.    Objective  To establish the maximally tolerated dose of the combination of cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone, and prednisone.    Methods and materials  Patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter phase 1 trial. Cabazitaxel 20 and 25\u00a0mg/m 2  were each evaluated in combination with escalating doses of mitoxantrone (starting dose 4\u00a0mg/m 2 ), given with prednisone 5\u00a0mg twice daily.    Results  A total of 25 patients were enrolled, with median age of 67 (range: 51\u201378) and prostate-specific antigen of 66.8\u00a0ng/ml (range: 3\u2013791.2). There were 4 dose-limiting toxicities (febrile neutropenia,  n  = 3; sepsis,  n  = 1). The maximally tolerated dose was cabazitaxel 20\u00a0mg/m 2  plus mitoxantrone 12\u00a0mg/m 2 . The most common treatment-related grade\u22653 related adverse events included neutropenia ( n  = 8; 32%), febrile neutropenia ( n  = 5; 20%), and thrombocytopenia ( n  = 4; 16%). The median number of treatment cycles was 8 (range: 2 to 19+). Decline in prostate-specific antigen to\u226550% from baseline was observed in 15 patients (60%). Objective responses were observed in 10/14 (71%) evaluable patients. The median radiographic progression-free survival was 14.5 months (95% CI: 8.0-not reached (NR)), and median overall survival was 23.3 months (95% CI: 14.3-NR).    Conclusions  The approved single-agent doses of mitoxantrone and cabazitaxel were safely combined. The combination led to durable tumor responses in most patients. Further study of the combination is warranted.",

Localized disease can be managed through active surveillance or curative, locally directed therapies, but 30% of men treated with surgery or radiation will need additional (often systemic) treatment for relapsed disease. While spectacular advances in medical treatment of advanced prostate cancer have improved the quality and duration of patients' lives, metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable, lethal disease that requires additional therapies and better treatment strategies. The advent of ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology provides an opportunity to comprehensively assess the constellation of genetic and molecular events underlying each patient's tumor, and promises to enhance our ability to deliver specifically tailored personalized treatment to men with prostate cancer. The known biological and clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer presents both opportunities and challenges to the application and utilization of sequence-based analysis to guide prostate cancer treatment.",

We found that 4EBP1, the central inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, was a critical regulator of both prostate cancer initiation and maintenance downstream of mTOR signaling in a genetic mouse model. 4EBP1 abundance was distinctly different between the epithelial cell types of the normal prostate. Of tumor-prone prostate epithelial cell types, luminal epithelial cells exhibited the highest transcript and protein abundance of 4EBP1 and the lowest protein synthesis rates, which mediated resistance to both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Decreasing total 4EBP1 abundance reversed resistance in drug-insensitive cells. Increased 4EBP1 abundance was a common feature in prostate cancer patients who had been treated with the PI3K pathway inhibitor BKM120; thus, 4EBP1 may be associated with drug resistance in human tumors. Our findings reveal a molecular program controlling cell type-specific 4EBP1 abundance coupled to the regulation of global protein synthesis rates that renders each epithelial cell type of the prostate uniquely sensitive or resistant to inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.",

These were demonstrated by assessing the exposure of 117 workers involved in wafer fabrication (fab) and chip packaging wearing personal dosimeters for a full shift. A portable device was used to monitor ELF-MF in high temporal resolution. All measurements were categorized by operation, job and working activity during working time. ELF-MF exposure of workers were classified based on the quartiles of ELF-MF distribution. The average levels of ELF-MF exposure were 0.56 \u00b5T for fab workers, 0.59 \u00b5T for chip packaging workers and 0.89 \u00b5T for electrical engineers, respectively. Exposure to ELF-MF differed among types of factory, operation, job and activity. Workers engaged in the diffusion and chip testing activities showed the highest ELF-MF exposure. The ELF-MF exposures of process operators were found to be higher than those of maintenance engineers, although peak exposure and/or patterns varied. The groups with the highest quartile ELF-MF exposure level are operators in diffusion, ion implantation, module and testing operations, and maintenance engineers in diffusion, module and testing operations. In conclusion, ELF-MF exposure among workers can be substantially affected by the type of operation and job, and the activity or location.",

We reviewed compliance-based chemical exposure data compiled between 2012 and 2014 by the study company. The chemical management system, characteristics of chemical use and hazardous gas monitoring system were also investigated. We evaluated the airborne isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and acetone generally used as cleaning solvents, volatile organic compounds and metals levels using internationally recommended sampling and analytical methods. Based on the results of past working environment measurement data and of our investigation, the overall current exposure to chemicals by semiconductor workers during routine production work appears to be controlled below occupational exposure limits. About 40% of chemical products used were found to contain at least one unidentifiable trade-secret substance. There are several situations and maintenance tasks that need special attention to reduce exposure to carcinogens as much as possible. In addition, a job-exposure matrix as a tool of surveillance system that can examine the exposure and health status of semiconductor workers according to type of operation and type of job or task is recommended.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated peak exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF) during the semiconductor manufacturing process based on an analysis of the time exposure patterns of semiconductor workers. This evaluation was manifested by measuring the personal exposure of 117 workers involved in wafer fabrication and chip packaging operations in the semiconductor industry. A portable EMDEX and work diary were used to monitor ELF with high temporal resolution. All ELF measurements (n = 942,885) were recorded every four seconds and categorised by operation and job during work periods exceeding six hours. We defined peak exposure levels as those higher than the arithmetic mean (AM), time-weighted average. The number of peaks per hour, the peak level above the AM and the contribution of peak exposure to the AM were compared by operation and job. ELF exposure ranged from 0.25 uT for chip test operators to 1.76 uT for diffusion maintenance engineers. The average number of peak exposures per hour at semiconductor operations ranged from 302 (die attachment engineers) to 764 (module engineers). The contribution of peak exposure to AM exposure during individual tasks for most workers in fab and chip packaging operations was substantial for higher than 60% of AM, but limited for other jobs, such as wafer test operators (29%) and office workers (50%). The ratio of peak values to average AM ranged from 1.5 (test operators) to 4 (electrical engineers). In conclusion, the level of ELF between peaks was found to be significant in most semiconductor operations, even though they are negligible for jobs with low AM and SD, such as office workers, chemical mechanical plating engineers and die attachment engineers.",

We collected a total of eleven models of HHF and monitored the ELF-MF as a function of fan speed and distance from the fan. EMDEX II was used to monitor the ELF-MF. An SMP2 EMF-meter equipped with a P400 field probe was used to determine the levels of ELF-MF and the frequency spectrum. Ten of the fans, excluding only one bladeless-fan model, emitted a high level of ELF-MF near the source of the HHF direct-current motor. The maximum measured level of ELF-MF ranged from 14.07 to 218.7\u2009\u00b5T. All measurements of the ELF-MF taken within 10\u2009cm from the HHFs showed values higher than 1.0\u2009\u00b5T. ELF-MF levels were found to decrease markedly with distance, regardless of the HHF product. The level of ELF-MF rose noticeably with increased fan speed. The speed of and distance from the HHF significantly influenced the level of ELF-MF. All principal frequencies ranged from 1 to 300\u2009Hz, which falls in the typical range of ELF.\u00a0\u00a9 2019 Bioelectromagnetics Society.",

        "abstract": "[Purpose] Gait-training robots have been developed for stroke patients with gait disturbance. It is important to survey the views of physiatrists and physical therapists on the characteristics of these devices during their development. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 100 physiatrists and 100 physical therapists from 38 hospitals participated in our questionnaire survey. [Results] The most common answers about the merits of gait-training robots concern improving the treatment effects (28.5%), followed by standardizing treatment (19%), motivating patients about treatment (17%), and improving patients' self-esteem (14%). The subacute period (1-3 months post-stroke onset) was most often chosen as the ideal period (47.3%) for the use of these devices, and a functional ambulation classification of 0-2 was the most selected response for the optimal patient status (27%). The preferred model was the treadmill type (47.5%) over the overground walking type (40%). The most favored commercial price was $50,000-$100,000 (38.3%). The most selected optimal duration for robot-assisted gait therapy was 30-45\u2005min (47%), followed by 15-30\u2005min (29%), 45-60\u2005min (18%), \u2265 60\u2005min (5%), and < 15\u2005min (1%). [Conclusion] Our study findings could guide the future designs of more effective gait-training robots for stroke patients. ",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to identify the risk factors related to development of hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias in patients with mechanical ventilation.Holter recording and echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours of ventilator initiation in patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) owing to respiratory failure (RF) from various reasons.From 68 patients, hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias were detected in 18 patients (26.5%). Initial mean arterial pressure, maximal heart rate, and initial pH were identified as risk factors for hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, the patients with pressure-controlled ventilation as an initial ventilatory mode developed hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias less frequently than the patients with other modes (15.8% vs. 40%, P = .03). In multivariate analysis, initial mean arterial pressure (< 70 mm Hg, odds ratio [OR]: 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 24.2, P = .026), maximal heart rate (> 120/min, OR: 19.7; 95% CI: 2.0 to 190.9, P = .01), and pressure-controlled ventilation (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.55, P = .006) were associated with the development of hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias.These findings suggest that during the early stages of mechanical ventilation with acute respiratory failure, hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmias are directly associated with tachycardia (> or = 120/min), initial MAP (<70 mm Hg), and, inversely, the initial use of pressure-controlled ventilation.",

        "abstract": "Essential tremor and Parkinson's disease-associated tremor are extremely prevalent within the field of movement disorders. The ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus has been commonly used as both a neuromodulatory and neuroablative target for the treatment of these forms of tremor. With both deep brain stimulation and Gamma Knife radiosurgery, there is an abundance of literature regarding the surgical planning, targeting, and outcomes of these methodologies. To date, there have been no reports of frameless, linear accelerator (LINAC)-based thalomotomies for tremor. The authors report the case of a patient with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease, with poor tremor improvement with medication, who was offered LINAC-based thalamotomy. High-resolution 0.9-mm isotropic MR images were obtained, and simulation was performed via CT with 1.5-mm contiguous slices. The VIM thalamic nucleus was determined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based segmentation on FSL using probabilistic tractography. The supplemental motor and premotor areas were the cortical target masks. The authors centered their isocenter within the region of the DTI-determined target and treated the patient with 140 Gy in a single fraction. The DTI-determined target had coordinates of 14.2 mm lateral and 8.36 mm anterior to the posterior commissure (PC), and 3 mm superior to the anterior commissure (AC)-PC line, which differed by 3.30 mm from the original target determined by anatomical considerations (15.5 mm lateral and 7 mm anterior to the PC, and 0 mm superior to the AC-PC line). There was faint radiographic evidence of lesioning at the 3-month follow-up within the target zone, which continued to consolidate on subsequent scans. The patient experienced continued right upper-extremity resting tremor improvement starting at 10 months until it was completely resolved at 22 months of follow-up. Frameless LINAC-based thalamotomy guided by DTI-based thalamic segmentation is a feasible method for achieving radiosurgical lesions of the VIM thalamus to treat tremor.",

A total of 15 patients with similar MRIs and no history of pituitary or sinonasal disease were selected as controls. \u2003Dimensions assessed were intercarotid distance; carotid canal width; piriform aperture width; distance from the piriform aperture to the anterior face of the sphenoid; sphenoid sinus height, width, and length; angle from anterior nasal spine to anteroinferior face of sphenoid sinus; choanal height; and nasal cavity height at the level of the vertical segment of the middle turbinate. Sphenoid sinus pneumatization patterns were recorded. \u2003There were 30 acromegalics and 31 Cushing disease patients.

Acromegalics had a significantly less acute angle (19\u2009\u00b1\u20093 degrees) from the anterior nasal spine to the sphenoid (\u2009<\u20090.05). Cushing disease patients had significantly lower sphenoid sinus length and shorter nasal cavity height (\u2009<\u20090.05). There were no differences in intercarotid distance or carotid canal width. \u2003As acromegalics and Cushing disease patients have known anatomic variations, the skull base surgeon should be aware of these differences and adapt their techniques and approaches as needed.",

The anti-osteoporotic effect of 1 was investigated in both in vitro cell cultures and in vivo using an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model. Compound 1 induced bone formation by stimulating osteoblast proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment with 1 increased the mRNA and protein expression of bone formation biomarkers through regulation of the BMP2 and Wnt signaling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells. Compound 1 also suppressed the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis of cultured mouse bone marrow cells. Oral administration of 1 restored the OVX-induced destruction of trabecular bone. The bone mineral density of the femur was also increased significantly by 1. The elevated serum levels of osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in the OVX mice were decreased by treatment with 1. These...",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in a variety of pathophysiological processes, including inflammation. Therefore, the suppression of NO production is a promising target in the design of anti-inflammatory agents. In the present study, a series of phthalimide analogs was synthesized, and their anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NO production in cultured murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. A structure-activity relationship study showed that the free hydroxyl group at C-4 and C-6 and the bulkiness of the  N -substituted alkyl chain are associated with biological activity. Among the series of phthalimide derivatives, compound  IIh  exhibited potent inhibitory activity, with an IC 50  value of 8.7\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Further study revealed that the inhibitory activity of compound  IIh  was correlated with the down-regulation of the mRNA and protein expression of LPS-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Compound  IIh  also suppressed the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-inflammatory activity of compound  IIh  was also found to be associated with the suppression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 signaling pathway by down-regulating the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and interferon-\u03b2 and signal transducer expression. These findings demonstrate that novel phthalimides might be potential candidates for the development of anti-inflammatory agents.",

The TCS was designed to minimize thermally induced spatial distortions in the interferometer optical modes and to provide some correction for static curvature errors in the core optics of aLIGO. The TCS is comprised of ring heater actuators, spatially tunable CO<sub>2</sub> laser projectors, and Hartmann wavefront sensors. The system meets the requirements of correcting for nominal distortion in aLIGO to a maximum residual error of 5.4 nm rms, weighted across the laser beam, for up to 125 W of laser input power into the interferometer.",

Instead of extracting propiverine from plasma using organic solvents, which should be separated from the aqueous phase and evaporated before injecting the sample into the chromatograph, plasma sample containing propiverine and N-oxide was directly injected after precipitating proteins with acetonitrile. Numerous compounds in the plasma did not interfere with the highly specific multiple reaction monitoring in tandem mass spectrometric detection following C(8) reversed-phase chromatographic separation under conditions that eluted propiverine, N-oxide and oxybutynin within 2min (0.1% formic acid in water/acetonitrile, 25:75, v/v). The LC-MS/MS method and an alternative LC-MS method, using methyl-t-butyl ether extraction and selected ion monitoring, were validated over 1-250ngml(-1) of propiverine and 2 to 500ngml(-1) of N-oxide, and successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study. The lower limit of quantitation was 1ngml(-1) for propiverine and 2ngml(-1) for N-oxide in both methods.",

        "abstract": "A simple, fast and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometric (MS) method has been developed for simultaneous determination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in human plasma using terbutaline as internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a C(8) reversed-phase column with formic acid-water-acetonirile (2:1000:100) and detected using electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry in negative selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The method was validated and successfully applied to analysis of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in clinical studies. The limit of quantitation, 0.12 microg/ml for amoxicillin and 0.062 microg/ml for clavulanic acid, was five times lower than that of the published HPLC-UV method.",
