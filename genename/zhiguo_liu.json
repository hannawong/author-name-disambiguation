Fatigue crack initiation life takes up most of the whole fatigue life of aluminum structure during service, making it key to evaluate effect of corrosion damage on crack initiation.

Compositions of these complexes are revealed to be Eu2(1-x)Y2x(TPA)(TTA)4- (TPPO)4 or Eu1-xYx(TPA)(TTA)(TPPO)2. Their IR spectra, fluorescent spectra and the thermal and optical stability were studied. The fluorescent excitation spectra of these complexes show more broad excitation bands than those of Eu2(TPA)3(TPPO)4 and Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 corresponding to their formations. In addition, both the binuclear complex EuY(TPA)(TTA)4(TPPO)4 and the chain complex Eu0.4Y0.6(TPA)(TTA)(TPPO)2 present higher thermal stability and better optical stability than the mononuclear complex Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2 does. And their thermal and optical stabilities are preferably interpreted from the binuclear structure together with the chain polynuclear structure of the complexes. The fluorescence enhancement of cofluorescence Y3+ ions to the Eu(\u2162) complexes is clear. The optimum content of Y3+ is 0.6 (molar fraction) for the chain complexes Eu1-xYx(TPA)(TTA)- (TPPO)2 and 0.5 for the binuclear complexes Eu2(1-x)Y2x(TPA)(TTA)4(TPPO)4. The formation of polynuclear structure of the complex Eu1-xYx(TPA)(TTA)(TPPO)2 appears to be responsible for the good cofluorescence effect of Y3+ ions.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of stability of Co-doped spinel \u03bb-MnO_2 that is referred to as spinel Li_xMn_2O_4 (x=0) was studied by using the first-principle calculation method. The total energy and formation enthalpy can be decreased remarkably due to the Co substation, resulting in a more stable structure of \u03bb-Mn_xCr_(2-x)O_4. The bond order and DOS analysis were given in detail to explain the nature of stability improvement. The calculated results show that as the content of Co dopant increases, the bond order of Mn\u2014O becomes larger and the peak of density of states around Fermi level shifts toward lower energy. The charge density distribution illustrates that the Mn\u2014O bonding is ionic and partially covalent, and the covalent Mn-O bonding becomes stronger with the increase of Co dopant content. The results confirm that the Codoping will enhance the stability of \u03bb-MnO_2 and hence improve the electrochemistry performance of Li_xMn_2O_4.",

        "abstract": "Mn 4+ -rich perovskite manganites (nominal composition: Pr 0.1 Ca 0.9 MnO 3 ) were synthesized by using a citric acid method and sintered at different temperatures (800, 900, 1000, and 1300 \u00b0C) to adjust the concentration of charge carrier. All the samples are found to be in the cluster glass state at low temperature, as indicated by dc and ac magnetization. With the increase of sintering temperature, the ferromagnetic component in samples increases at first, and attains a maximum at 1000 \u00b0C, then decreases again at 1300 \u00b0C, which could be well interpreted by the change of charge carrier concentration induced by nonstoichiometry, consistent with the trend on the phase diagram. However, nonstoichiometry breaks long-range Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn interaction, resulting in the variance from the phase diagram. PACS 75.47.Lx 75.50 73.22.\u2212f Keywords Manganite Ferromagnetism Cluster glass 1 Introduction Hole-doped manganites with a perovskite structure have attracted much attention in recent years. On the contrary, a little work has been devoted to electron-doped manganites, which also exhibit rich physical phenomena. Among the interesting phenomena, colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect is of great importance because of its potential applications in the electronic industry. Different from the hole-doped side, CMR is observed only in a narrow range of compositions for electron-doped manganites [1\u20133] , as indicated by the phase diagram of Pr 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3 [4] . It is noteworthy that the physical properties of the Pr 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3 system are sensitive to the concentration of charge carrier near x= 0.9, where a transition from antiferromagnetic insulating state, concomitant with charge ordering to cluster glass, occurs, and the CMR effect is observed as well. The properties of manganites are significantly influenced by three factors, which are namely concentration of charge carrier, average A-site cationic radius \u3008 r A \u3009 and A-site cationic size mismatch [5\u20138] . Alkaline earth element doping is usually used to adjust the ratio of Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ ; however, the variations of \u3008 r A \u3009 and A-site cationic size mismatch are introduced at the same time. Fortunately, oxygen nonstoichiometry can be used to adjust the concentration of charge carrier without changing \u3008 r A \u3009 and A-site cationic size mismatch. Oxygen nonstoichiometry was found in the Pr 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3 system synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction technique [9,10] . As for LaMnO 3+ \u03b4 prepared by the sol\u2013gel method, the content of oxygen was adjusted by sintering the precursor powder at different temperatures [11] . In order to trace the effect of the concentration of charge carrier on electron-doped manganites, Pr 0.1 Ca 0.9 MnO 3 was synthesized by a citric acid method. Different sintering temperatures were adopted to regulate the oxygen content of single-component Pr 0.1 Ca 0.9 MnO 3 , with the same \u3008 r A \u3009 and A-site cationic size mismatch, so that the properties of materials can be controlled separately by the concentration of charge carrier. 2 Experimental Stoichiometric amounts of Pr 6 O 11 were dissolved in citric acid, then mixed with required amounts of Ca(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b74H 2 O and Mn(NO) 3 in distilled water to form a solution with a concentration of 0.05 mol/L. After that, citric acid was added to the solution in the molar ratio of 1:1 to the cations. The solution was then stirred and heated at 70 \u00b0C until a gel was formed. The resulted gel was evaporated in an oven at 120 \u00b0C for 6 h to yield a dry powder. Finally, it was pelletized and sintered at 800, 900, 1000 and 1300 \u00b0C for 12 h. For simplicity, the above samples are denoted as PCM800, PCM900, PCM1000 and PCM1300, respectively. The ratio between Pr(Ca) and Mn in the materials was determined using a JOEL JXA 8800 L electron microprobe microanalyzer. Oxygen contents of all samples were determined by iodometric titration. The results are shown in Table 1 . It is evident that element manganese and oxygen nonstoichiometry occurs during the preparation. Oxygen loss increases with sintering temperature, while manganese loss is almost constant. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bede D 1 X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K \u03b1 radiation. The magnetic properties were measured using the quantum design physical properties measurement system (PPMS). The samples were first cooled to 10 K under zero-field (zero-field cooling (ZFC)) and an applied field (field cooling (FC)), then the data were collected during the warming process. Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured at 10 K. Under the ZFC process, ac susceptibility measurement for the samples was performed. 3 Results and discussion All the samples are found to be in the single orthorhombic phase with a perovskite structure, as confirmed by XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 , with the peaks indexed. The grain sizes ( D ) derived from Scherrer's Equation are shown in Table 1 . Obviously, the grain size increases with increasing sintering temperature. Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of dc magnetization for all the samples under the ZFC and FC conditions. For samples sintered at relatively lower temperatures (PCM800, PCM900, PCM1000), FC curves exhibit a \u201cBrillouin-like\u201d temperature dependence of the magnetization, indicating a ferromagnetic state induced below T C (around 100 K). The magnetization at 10 K ( M 10 K ) increases with the increase of the sintering temperature, so does T C . As for PCM1300, the shape of the FC curve is slightly altered with a peak superimposed on the ferromagnetic-like curve. M 10 K of this sample is lower than that of the other three samples. T C is also lower than that of PCM900 and PCM1000. Compared with FC magnetization, ZFC ones are rather low and a peak appears at some temperature ( T p ) a little below T C , where FC and ZFC curves show bifurcation. As temperature is decreased further, large difference occurs between FC and ZFC curves. The features indicate the absence of long-range order and the presence of cluster glass state for all the samples below T C [12] . Shown in Fig. 3 are the magnetic hysteresis loops measured at 10 K. All the curves show a well-defined magnetic hysteresis loop, which suggests the existence of a ferromagnetic component. No saturation is found under a magnetic field up to 5 T, consistent with the cluster glass behavior. All the phenomena can be well interpreted by a model that ferromagnetic clusters embed in antiferromagnetic matrix [13] . The coercivity ( H c ) decreases with the increase of sintering temperature, coinciding with the fact of increasing D ( Table 1 ). The T C , T p , and M 10 K , together with H c at 10 K of all the samples, are listed in Table 1 . When doping Pr for Ca in CaMnO 3 , Mn 3+ ions are created due to charge balance. Double exchange interaction is therefore introduced between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ , resulting in ferromagnetic coupling. In contrast, Mn 4+ , the majority in the materials, forms an antiferromagnetic matrix dominated by the Mn 4+ \u2013Mn 4+ superexchange interaction, in which ferromagnetic clusters distributed randomly. This can be verified by the asymmetry of the M \u2013 H behavior of all the samples ( Fig. 3 ), which is caused by the exchange bias effect, and is usually found in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic mixed systems. The competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic component contributes to the cluster glass state at low temperature. Field cooling aligns the clusters, which leads to the onset of a relatively large ferromagnetic-type magnetization, while ZFC freezes the clusters in random orientations, resulting in the large difference between FC and ZFC curves. The nonstoichiometry of oxygen and manganese occurs during the sintering process in air. As is known, nonstoichiometry usually creates vacancies in perovskites, which changes the ratio of Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ . The sintering temperature increasing from 800 to 1000 \u00b0C leads to larger nonstoichiometry and more e g electrons (Mn 3+ ) in the samples, as shown in Table 1 . e g electrons favors the ferromagnetic state, so that M 10 K and T C increase. As sintering temperature rises further to 1300 \u00b0C, the concentration of e g electron becomes so high that localization of electrons or local charge ordering appears [9,10] ; hence ferromagnetism is suppressed, and M 10 K and T C decrease simultaneously. The increasing antiferromagnetic component contributes to its FC curve, which exhibits both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features. In order to further determine the cluster glass state at low temperature, the ac magnetic susceptibility of PCM900 and PCM1300 is measured. PCM900 is a representative of 800\u20131000 \u00b0C sintered samples for the similarity of their FC\u2013ZFC curves. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the ZFC ac susceptibility for PCM900 ( Fig. 4 (a)) and PCM1300 ( Fig. 4 (b)) measured at 51, 1001, 5002, and 9997 Hz, where \u03c7 \u2032( T ) and \u03c7 \u2033( T ) are the in-phase and out-of-phase components, respectively. For PCM900, a sharp peak appears at around 100 K, and another round peak appears at about 67 K on the \u03c7 \u2032( T ) and \u03c7 \u2033( T ) curves. As frequency increases, the peaks on \u03c7 \u2032( T ) shift to high temperature, and the intensity decreases. For PCM1300, the two peaks feature remains on the \u03c7 \u2032( T ) and \u03c7 \u2033( T ) curves. Compared with PCM900, the high-temperature peak is frequency independent and shows higher intensity, while the low-temperature peak is less frequency dependent and exhibits lower intensity, which is not enough to give the position, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4 (b). This feature indicates cluster glass state for both samples. The peaks around 100 K correspond to paramagnetic\u2013ferromagnetic and paramagnetic\u2013antiferromagnetic transition, for T C = T N in Pr 0.1 Ca 0.9 MnO 3 [4] . The peaks around 67 K signal the freezing of ferromagnetic clusters [4] . The frequency dependence of the peaks on \u03c7 \u2032( T ) can be fitted by the well-known expression: (1) \u03c4 = \u03c4 0 ( T f - T g T g ) - z \u03c5 where \u03c4 \u221d(1/2 \u03c0f ) ( f is the measuring frequency), \u03c4 0 is the characteristic time scale for the spin dynamics, T f the freezing temperature of glass and T g the critical temperature for glass ordering (this is equivalent to the f \u21920 value of T f ). For PCM900, the amplified drawing and the fitting of the peak around 67 K is shown in Fig. 5 , with z\u03bd =4.754, \u03c4 0 =1.2\u00d710 \u221212 s and T g =66.78 K. The z\u03bd and \u03c4 0 values are not in the range of spin-glass systems (5< z\u03bd <11, \u03c4 0 \u223c10 \u221213 s) [14,15] , consistent with the cluster glass nature mentioned above. It is noteworthy that the peak around 100 K is also frequency dependent. At the crossover between spin glass and cluster glass, a similar phenomenon is observed [13,16] . Therefore, it could be ascribed to the size of clusters. As shown in Table 1 , when the sintering temperature increases to 1000 \u00b0C, the concentration of Mn 3+ ions increases, hence more ferromagnetic clusters are created. As the sintering temperature increases to 1300 \u00b0C, higher Mn 3+ concentration converts some ferromagnetic clusters to antiferromagnetic ones. Consequently, the peak around 100 K on the \u03c7 \u2033( T ) curve for PCM1300 exhibits frequency independence. Less amount of ferromagnetic clusters gives higher intensity of the peak around 100 K and a lower intensity for the one at about 67 K. As indicated from the phase diagram of Pr 1\u2212 x Ca x MnO 3 [4] , around x =0.9, the decrease of x increases the amount of antiferromagnetic component and converts the system to the antiferromagnetic state eventually. As for the present system, the variation of sintering temperature from 800 to 1300 \u00b0C decreases Mn 4+ concentration from 0.87 to 0.81. The ferromagnetic component increases first and decreases later. This fits the trend from the phase diagram; however, the crossover (near x =0.81, PCM1300) is different. It can be interpreted by the effect of defects. Nonstoichiometry of oxygen and manganese breaks the long-range Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn interaction, which hinders the formation of the long-range antiferromagnetic state and keeps the system in cluster glass state when x is as low as 0.81. 4 Conclusion The charge carrier concentration in electron-doped manganites (nominal composition: Pr 0.1 Ca 0.9 MnO 3 ) has been adjusted successfully by changing the sintering temperature. All the samples exhibit cluster glass behavior at low temperature. When the sintering temperature increases, the ferromagnetic component increases first, then decreases at 1300 \u00b0C, fitting the trend on the phase diagram. The departure from the phase diagram could be explained by the fact that nonstoichiometry breaks long-range Mn\u2013O\u2013Mn interaction.

        "abstract": "Polycrystalline Sr 2 Fe 1\u2212 x Zn x MoO 6 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.2) compounds with ordered double perovskite structure were fabricated and their magnetic, and magnetoresistance properties were systematically investigated. The X-ray powder diffraction refinements show that the degree of cationic order decreases gradually with increasing Zn content. A great enhancement of low field magnetoresistance and saturated magnetoresistance curves near 1 T are achieved in Zn doped samples. Analysis of the magnetization curves indicates that the doped Zn 2+ ions may easily occupy the abnormal Fe sites and destroy the antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe anti-site defects, and so the magnetoresistance under high field was strongly suppressed. PACS 73.43.Qt 75.30.-m 75.30.Kz Keywords Magnetoresistance Magnetic order 1 Introduction The double perovskite Sr 2 FeMoO 6 (SFMO) are being intensively investigated nowadays due to the finding of large magnetoresistance (MR) at room-temperature [1] . The ferromagnetic order of localized Fe 3+ ions can be achieved through the mediation of itinerant conduction electrons of Mo 5+ ions [2] . Its high Curie temperature above 400 K and half-metallic nature make SFMO become an ideal candidate to be used in magnetoelectronics [1,3] . The low field MR (LFMR) is commonly considered to arise from the spin-dependent scattering at grain boundary [4] . Meanwhile, Garia-Hernandezs et al. pointed out that the anti-site defects in SFMO have great influence on the MR [5] . The anti-site defects, which are the partial Fe(Mo) ions misplaced at Mo(Fe) sites, also commonly cause the reduction of the saturated magnetic moment pre formula unit of bulk SFMO [5\u20138] . The small value of MR only at high field in single crystalline SFMO may originate from the anti-site defects [9] , because the antiferromagnetically coupled Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs at anti-site defects will be progressively aligned with increasing magnetic field. A lot of investigations on cationic doping at both Sr and Mo sites have been done in order to explore the influence of doping on MR in SFMO [10\u201312] . But the substitution of the Fe site has not been so extensively studied. It is well known that the magnetic structure, especially the anti-site defects, can be changed notably by doping at Fe site, thus the work about substitution of Fe ion should be more helpful for understanding the correlation between magnetic structure and magnet-transport in SFMO. Some works, such as doping Cr, V, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu and Al ions at Fe site in SFMO [13\u201321] , have been reported. Furthermore, both intragrain MR and intergrain MR at low temperature were observed in the Ba 2 Fe 1\u2212 x M x MoO 6 (M = Mn, Zn) compacts by Sriti et al. [22] . Therefore, further research about doping at Fe site in SFMO is still necessary to understand the correlation between magnetic structure and MR in this compound. In this paper, the structure, magnetic and magnetoresistance properties of SFMO with Zn doping were detail investigated with a special emphasis and cautions on the role of antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs. The doped Zn 2+ ions might easily occupy the abnormal Fe sites and destroy the antiferrimagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs. Therefore, the MR under high field is suppressed by the disappearance of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs. 2 Experimental details A series of Sr 2 Fe 1\u2212 x Zn x MoO 6 ( x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2) polycrystalline samples were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. The mixture of high purity SrCO 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , ZnO and MoO 3 was pressed into pellets and calcined in air at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h. The pellets were then reground, pressed and reheated with sintering at 1200 \u00b0C for 5 h in a stream of 1.8% H 2 /N 2 . X-ray diffraction powder patterns were collected using a Bede D 1 XRD spectrometer with Ni-filtered Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The room-temperature XRD patterns were refined by the Rietveld method using the program FULLPROF [23,24] . Resistivity was measured using a DC four-probe method and magnetization measurement was carried out using the physical properties measurement system (PPMS) of quantum design. 3 Results and discussion Room-temperature XRD patterns reveal that a single double perovskite phase is obtained. Detailed Rietveld analysis of the XRD patterns has also been done using FULLPROF program. The experimental and calculated XRD patterns as well as their difference for x = 0.1 are shown in Fig. 1 . Refinements using the tetragonal I 4/ mmm space groups lead to the smallest quality-of-fit parameters ( R Bragg = 3.5), as found for SFMO [12] . Other XRD patterns were also well refined using the same space group. The degree of cationic disorder p , which is defined as the fraction of Fe(Mo) ions misplaced at Mo(Fe) sites, can be calculated from the refinement of XRD patterns [9] . The value of p increases from 5 to 10% with x increasing from 0 to 15%, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 , suggesting that the number of anti-site defects increases with increasing Zn content. It is well known that t he order of B \u2032/ B \u2033sublattice will increase with increasing the charge difference between B \u2032 and B \u2033 sites in A 2 B \u2032 B \u2033O 6 [12,18] . However, several reports have a little difference with this viewpoint. For example, in the Sr 2 Fe 1\u2212 x Cu x MoO 6 samples, the cationic order decreases firstly with Cu 2+ content increasing from 0 to 15% and then increases with further increase of Cu 2+ content [18] ; and large cationic disorder on the B \u2032/ B \u2033 sites induced by Zn substitutions for Fe was also observed in Ba 2 FeMoO 6 by Sriti et al. [22] . Therefore, it is not occasional that the degree of cationic order decreases from 95 to 90% with Zn increasing from 0 to 15%, and then increases with increasing Zn content. The value of saturated magnetic moment per formula unit ( M S ) of bulk SFMO is sensitive to the number of anti-site defects. The dependence of M S of pure SFMO on p is well described as M S = (4 \u2212 8 p ) \u03bc B , which agrees with the experimental data [6] and the Monte Carlo computation [7] based on the assumption of the antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe and no magnetic coupling in Mo\u2013O\u2013Mo. According to the equation of Fe 3+ + Mo 5+ \u2192 M 2+ + Mo 6+ , the doped Zn 2+ ions can induce the formation of Mo 6+ . So the nonmagnetic Zn 2+ \u2013O\u2013Mo 6+ pairs may exist in SFZMO. There are only two possible states for doped Zn ions at Fe site. In one case, all Zn ions located at the normal Fe site, and thus the value of M S of SFZMO can be given as M S = [(4 \u2212 8 p ) \u2212 4 x ] \u03bc B , where the second term corresponds to the reduction of magnetization due to the formation of nonmagnetic Zn 2+ \u2013O\u2013Mo 6+ pairs. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 2 (open circle) that the calculated value is smaller than the experimental data in this case. In the other case, parts of the doped Zn occupied the abnormal Fe site, such as in the Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe anti-site regions, thereby forming the Fe\u2013O\u2013Zn. The value of M S in SFZMO will be changed to M S =[(4 \u2212 8 p ) \u2212 x (4 \u2212 9 p )] \u03bc B , where the second term accounts for the lowering of magnetic moment due to the doped Zn 2+ ions. The calculated values of M S are also shown in Fig. 2 (open square). The agreement between the experimental and the estimated data is remarkably good. It is worth indicating that the doped Zn 2+ ions might easily occupy the abnormal Fe sites and destroy the antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs. Fig. 3 shows the normalized magnetization curve of the sample of x = 0.15 at 5 K and up to 5 T. The normalized magnetization curves of SFZMO can be fitted by using the following expression [25] : M ( H )/ M S = (1 \u2212 \u03b1 )[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 H / H S )] + \u03b1 tanh( BH / T ) where the first term stands for the contribution of ferromagnetic-coupled and the second mainly arises from the Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe antiferromagnetic pairs. Thus the prefactor \u03b1 mainly refers to the fraction of antiferromagnetic interaction and H S is the saturated magnetic field. The experimental data is fitted excellently by this equation, as shown in Fig. 3 . Other samples have similar features, and the variations of \u03b1 and H S with x are shown in the inset of Fig. 3 . When all of the doped Zn ions located at the normal Fe site, much more Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs will be created with decreasing degree of cationic order, thus the value of \u03b1 should increase with increasing Zn content. The reduction of \u03b1 from 16% at x = 0 to 11% at x = 0.2 indicates that the contributions of antiferromagnetic to total magnetic moment decreases monotonously with increasing Zn content, which suggests that the number of antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs is reduced by Zn doping. This result is well consistent with the earlier analysis that the antiferrimagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs are destroyed by the doped Zn 2+ ions. The value of H S decreases gradually from 670 Oe at x = 0 to 530 Oe at x = 0.2, which means that the magnetic field for aligning the ferromagnetic domains was reduced progressively with Zn doping. The forming of Mo\u2013O\u2013Zn\u2013O\u2013Mo chains with no magnetic interaction can divide the ferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Mo domains into some smaller ferromagnetic ones, thus the saturated magnetic field H S of SFZMO was reduced. Fig. 4 shows the field dependence of MR for SFZMO at 5 K, where the MR was defined as: MR(%) = 100% \u00d7 [ \u03c1 (0) \u2212 \u03c1 ( H )]/ \u03c1 (0); \u03c1 (0) and \u03c1 ( H ) are the resistivity under zero field and external field H , respectively. The LFMR of SFMO was enhanced remarkably by Zn doping. Based on the analysis of magnetic structure, the relationship between the MR and magnetic field can be generally described as: MR( H )= c [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 H / H S )] 2 + d tanh( BH / T ), where the first term represent the LFMR arising from the spin-dependent scattering that had been demonstrated by Xiao et al. [26] , and the second term describes the MR under high field originating from the antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs. The value of c and d refer to the MR under low and high field, respectively. This equation works very well for representing the experimental data, as shown in Fig. 4 . The variation of H S obtained from the fitting of the MR( H ) curves (not shown in this paper) has similar tendency with that obtained from the fitting of M ( H ) curves (as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 ). This result also means that there are strong correlation between the magnetic structure and magnet-transport in SFZMO compounds. The variations of c and d with x obtained from the best fits are shown in the inset of Fig. 4 . It is found that the value of c increases from 18.6% at x = 0 to 34% at x = 0.15, and then decreases little, while the value of d decreases gradually with increasing Zn content. The above analysis of magnetic structure shows that the doped nonmagnetic Zn ions will lead to the formation of the nonmagnetic and insulated Mo\u2013O\u2013Zn\u2013O\u2013Mo chains, which can divide the large ferromagnetic regions into many smaller ones and acts as barriers for spin-dependent scattering. Therefore, the LFMR will be enhanced remarkably because the smaller magnetic moments become more sensitive to the field [20] . It was worth mentioning that the MR curves of x > 0.1 almost saturate near 1 T, just as the field dependence of magnetization curves at 5 K (as shown in Fig. 3 ). The degree of cationic order of SFMO is as high as 95%, but the MR curve does not turate up to 5 T. This suggests that a little number of antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs may influence dramatically the MR at high field because the Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs will be progressively aligned with increasing magnetic field. Serrate et al. pointed out that the MR value of double perovskite Ba 1.6 Sr 0.4 FeMoO 6 can be saturated only above 40 T [27] . The saturated MR curves of x > 0.1 near 1 T can be explained by the disappearance of antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs after Zn doping. With the doped Zn ions occupy the abnormal Fe sites and destroy the antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs, the magnetic field for aligning the antiferromagnetic pairs will decrease. Thus the MR curves easily saturate at low field, and the MR which origins from the antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe is suppressed by doped Zn ions. Moreover, both intragrain MR and intergrain MR were observed in Ba 2 FeMoO 6 with Zn doping, and the remarkable intergrain MR at low temperature was attributed to the modifications of grain boundary after Zn doping [22] . However, though the effect of grain boundary on the measured resistivity cannot be avoided for polycrystalline sample, the change of grain boundary after Zn doping may be omitted in our samples because all samples were prepared by the same process and there is no other phase detected in our XRD profiles. Therefore, the variation of MR in our samples should originate from the change of magnetic structure of SFMO after replacing partial Fe ions by Zn ions, which is similar to that of doping nonmagnetic Al ion in SFMO [20] . 4 Conclusion In summary, the structure, magnetic and magnetoresistance properties of SFZMO were studied. The structure refinements show that the degree of cationic order decreases firstly with increasing Zn content and then increases with further increasing Zn content. The magnetic measurement and fitting result reveal that the formation of Mo\u2013O\u2013Zn\u2013O\u2013Mo chains can divide the large ferromagnetic region into many smaller ones and weaken the magnetic interaction among them, and that the creation of antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs is suppressed by Zn doping. The smaller magnetic regions with weakened magnetic interaction are more sensitive to the external magnetic field. Therefore, the great enhancement of LFMR and the reduction of MR under high field are achieved by doped Zn ions. Furthermore, the disappearance of antiferromagnetic Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe pairs results in the weak field dependent of MR under high magnetic field.

        "abstract": "PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 was synthesized by using a citric acid method. Compared with the sample prepared by the solid state technique, the sample synthesized by the citric acid method crystallized at a lower temperature. X-ray diffraction data indicated that a pure orthorhombic phase was formed at 1300 \u00b0C. PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 showed a conductivity of 0.076 S/cm at 800 \u00b0C and an activation energy of 32.98 kJ/mol. Its average thermal expansion coefficient from 600 to 1000 \u00b0C was 11.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 , which well matches with the NiO/YSZ anode and doped LaMnO 3 cathode. A power density of 55 mW/cm 2 and a short circuit current density of 200 mA/cm 2 were obtained at 900 \u00b0C in a single fuel cell experiment by using PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 as an electrolyte. This could be attributed to the existence of hole conduction in the sample. Keywords Oxides Chemical synthesis Thermogravimetric analysis Electron microscopy 1 Introduction The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) attracts much attention because of its high efficiency and low pollution. Stablized ZrO 2 is widely used as the electrolyte of SOFCs [1] , however, limited by its oxygen ion conductivity, zirconia-based SOFCs must operate at 1000 \u00b0C, which causes some electrode reactions and other problems. Reduction of the operating temperature can increase the stability, prolong the lifetime and lower the cost of SOFCs. Therefore, searching for new electrolyte materials with high conductivity at lower temperatures is worthwhile. Several years ago, LaGaO 3 -based oxides with high oxygen conductivity were found by Ishihara et al. [2] . These ABO 3 -type perovskites can accommodate large concentrations of anion vacancies and show a superior oxygen ion conductivity [3\u20137] , e.g., La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Ga 0.83 Mg 0.17 O 2.825 has the conductivity of 0.17 S/cm at 800 \u00b0C [3] , which is the highest oxygen ion conductivity of any ceramic apart from the Bi 2 O 3 based materials. In materials prepared by traditional solid state technique, a little glass phase exists in the grain boundary region, which assists in forming denser microstructure, but decreases the oxygen ion conductivity [8] . On the contrary, the citric acid method starts from a mixed solution of different components, so it becomes an attractive route to synthesize materials with high purity, ultrahomogeneity, and a reduced crystallizing temperature. In the family of ABO 3 -type rare gallate perovskites, PrGaO 3 -based oxides have also been suitable as electrolytes of SOFC [9] . In our previous work [10] , we found PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 electrolyte had superior properties. To obtain a sample with better properties, we synthesized PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 perovskite by using a citric acid method. The sample was characterized by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), density and dilatometer. Its electrical properties were also studied. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample synthesis According to the formula PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 , the required amount of Pr 6 O 11 was first dissolved by nitric acid, then mixed with stoichiometric amounts of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and Ga(NO 3 ) 3 in distilled water to form a solution with a concentration of 0.05 mol/l. After that, citric acid was added to the solution in the molar ratio 1:1 to the cations. The solution was then stirred, heated at 60 \u00b0C until a gel was formed. The resulted gel was evaporated in an oven at 150 \u00b0C for 6 h to yield dry powder. Finally, it was pelletized and sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 12 h. 2.2 Thermal analysis Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermal gravity analysis (TGA) data of the resulted gel were obtained from a Perkin-Elmer DTA 1700 and TGA 7 thermal analyzer in air. The data were collected from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C for DTA and 800 \u00b0C for TGA at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. 2.3 X-ray diffraction The structure of the sample was examined by X-ray diffraction using a Rigaku-D-Max rA 12 kW X-ray Diffractometer with Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm). 2.4 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The particle size of the powder calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h, and the morphology of the sample sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 12 h were observed by a Hitachi H8100-IV microscope. 2.5 Density The density of the sample sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 12 h was measured using the Archimedes technique. 2.6 Thermal expansion property A Netzsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer was used to measure the thermal expansion properties of the sample from room temperature to 1000 \u00b0C in air at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min. 2.7 Electrical properties A Solartron SI-1260 Impedance Analyzer was applied to measure the conductivity of the sample, which was painted with silver paste on both sides and baked at 850 \u00b0C for 15 min. A single fuel cell was fabricated by using a sample disc (0.8 mm in thickness and 10 mm in diameter) as the electrolyte and silver as the cathode and anode. The performance of the cell was measured at 900 \u00b0C. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermal analysis Fig. 1 shows the DTA and TGA data of the gel. There exists a strong exothermal peak at 227 \u00b0C in the DTA curve, which suggests the decomposition of the residual organic matter. The exothermal peak at 288 \u00b0C can be attributed to the decomposition of the nitrates. Both have corresponding weight loss reflected in the TGA curve. The weight loss starts from about 100 \u00b0C, at which point the absorbed water evaporates. A wide, weak exothermal peak at about 650 \u00b0C can be attributed to the crystallization and no corresponding weight loss shows in the TGA curve, consistent with the following XRD data. 3.2 XRD patterns The XRD data of the samples sintered at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 . After being sintered at 600 \u00b0C in air for 12 h, the powder remains amorphous. It has crystallized at 700 \u00b0C and some unknown phase, Pr 6 O 11 and a perovskite phase are formed. It indicates that the exothermal peak at 650 \u00b0C in the DTA curve is due to the crystallization of the sample. When the sintering temperature is above 800 \u00b0C, PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 perovskite with orthorhombic structure dominates in the sample. The impurity phase disappears when the sintering temperature is further increased to 1300 \u00b0C. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized by using the citric acid method and the solid state technique. It is clear that the sample using citric acid method crystallized at lower temperature. 3.3 TEM, SEM results and density The TEM micrograph of the powder sintered at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h is shown in Fig. 4 . The average particle size is about 200 nm. Fig. 5 shows the morphology of the disc sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 12 h. It can be seen that the sample disc is dense except for some small pores. The density of disc sintered at 1500 \u00b0C is 6.92 g/cm 3 , which is about 95.7% of the theoretical density (7.23 g/cm 3 ) derived from XRD data. Both results show that the sintering of sample is good. 3.4 Thermal expansion property The thermal expansion property of PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 and YSZ is shown in Fig. 6 . The average thermal expansion coefficient of PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 from 600 to 1000 \u00b0C is 11.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 , which is equal to that of a (\u223c35 vol.% NiO)/YSZ anode. Above 30 vol.% nickel, the conductivity of NiO/YSZ anode is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the anode with nickel below 30 vol.% [1] . The thermal expansion coefficient of the anode also increases with the content of NiO. Compared with YSZ, whose thermal expansion coefficient is about 10.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 , the PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 electrolyte can be better matched with the NiO/YSZ anode at the operating temperature of SOFCs. Furthermore, the PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 electrolyte matches with a doped LaMnO 3 cathode in thermal expansion coefficient as well, e.g., the thermal expansion coefficient of La 0.89 Sr 0.10 MnO 3 is 12.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 [1] . 3.5 Electrical properties Fig. 7 shows the Arrhenius plot of the PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 electrolyte. Its conductivity is 0.076 S/cm at 800 \u00b0C and the activation energy is 32.98 kJ/mol. The I \u2013 V and I \u2013 P curves of a single fuel cell using PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 as the electrolyte are shown in Fig. 8 . A power density of 55 mW/cm 2 and a short circuit current density of 200 mA/cm 2 are obtained at 900 \u00b0C. The low performance is due to the existence of Pr 4+ ions in the sample, which results in hole conduction [9] . When doping the divalent ion Mg 2+ for the trivalent ion Ga 3+ , the tetravalent praseodymium, Pr 4+ , is created besides oxygen vacancies, as stated in our previous work [11] . In the sample with small particle size, because of its high reactive activity, there exists a higher Pr 4+ content, which decreases the open circuit voltage and power density of the cell. 4 Conclusions The PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 electrolyte with orthorhombic structure was synthesized by a citric acid method. The average particle size of the powder sintered at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h is about 200 nm. The pure perovskite phase was formed at 1300 \u00b0C. The sample was dense after being sintered at 1500 \u00b0C for 12h, and also matched with NiO/YSZ anode and doped LaMnO 3 cathode in thermal expansion coefficient well. Nevertheless, the performance of the single fuel cell using PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 as an electrolyte was low because of the hole conduction in the sample. Further work needs to be done to solve the problem.

The present fuel cell shows excellent performance at lowered temperatures. Keywords Solid oxide fuel cells Screen-printing Electrolyte films Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have attracted more and more attention in recent decades because of their high energy conversion efficiency, flexibility of fuels and reduced pollution [1,2] . The traditional Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-supported SOFCs always operates at around 1000 \u00b0C for acceptable performance. However, it is difficult to expect a good long-term stability at such a high temperature because of the sintering of the electrodes, the diffusion of material between the cell components and the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) [3] . From the viewpoint of cost reduction and long-term stability, it is necessary to lower the operating temperature. Anode-supported YSZ thin film SOFCs have been extensively studied and have shown excellent performance at intermediate-temperatures from 600 to 800 \u00b0C [4\u20136] . Substituting doped-cerias for YSZ will further lower the operating temperature because of the higher ionic conductivity of doped-cerias at the lowered temperature [7] . Leng et al. [8] reported that dense Ce 0.8 Gd 0.2 O 1.9 (GDC) electrolyte films could be obtained in situ by a solid-state reaction. A maximum power density of 578 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C was obtained based on a 10-\u03bcm-thick GDC film and a La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 (LSCF)\u2013GDC cathode. Xia and Liu [9] prepared a 20-\u03bcm-thick GDC film by conventional dry-pressing and got a maximum power density of 400 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C by using Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 (SSC)\u2013SDC as the cathode. It is known that the performance of anode-supported film SOFCs is basically limited by cathode polarization resistance [9,10] . So, a new cathode material is desirable to further improve the performance. Recently, Shao and Haile [11] reported that Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) was an excellent cathode material for SOFCs operating at lowered temperatures. Their single fuel cell made of a dry-pressed SDC electrolyte film (20 \u03bcm thick) and a BSCF cathode layer exhibited a very high power density of 1010 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C using moist hydrogen as fuel and airflow as the oxidant. Screen-printing [12,13] is a simple and inexpensive technology for fabrication of dense films onto porous substrates. Peng et al. [14] fabricated a dense Ce 0.8 Y 0.2 O 1.9 (YDC) film (15 \u03bcm thick) onto a porous NiO\u2013YDC anode by screen-printing. Based on this YDC film and Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 cathode, they obtained a maximum power density of 230 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. Xia et al. [15] got a Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 (SDC) electrolyte film with a thickness of 30 \u03bcm using a similar screen-printing technology. Combined with a SSC\u2013SDC cathode, their fuel cell provided maximum power densities of 118 and 397 mW cm \u22122 at 500 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. In this paper, gas-tight Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 films were fabricated on porous NiO\u2013SDC anode substrates by screen-printing. Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 powder was prepared and screen-printed onto the sintered SDC electrolyte films. Using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, a single cell with a 12-\u03bcm-thick SDC film exhibited maximum power densities of 1080 and 1280 mW cm \u22122 at 600 and 650 \u00b0C, respectively. The excellent fuel cell performance shows a significant improvement when the fabrication of the ceria-based electrolyte film for SOFCs uses screen-printing technology. 2 Experimental NiO powder was prepared by a precipitation method. Ammonia (analytical reagent, A.R.) was added to a Ni(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R.) solution drop by drop to obtain nickel hydroxide deposition. Then, the as-prepared deposition was aged at 70 \u00b0C for 40 min. After washing by alcohol and drying at 105 \u00b0C, the resultant deposition was finally fired at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h to get nickel oxide powder. Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 powder was synthesized by a citric-nitrate process. Ba(NO 3 ) 2 (A.R.), Sr(NO 3 ) 2 (A.R.), Co(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R.) and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O (A.R.) were used as the starting materials. Stoichiometric amounts of nitrate were dissolved in deionized water and citric acid (A.R.) was added as a complexant. The molar ratio of the total cation concentration to the citric acid was 1:1.15. The solution was evaporated at 75\u2013100 \u00b0C to form a dry gel, which was finally fired at 1000 \u00b0C for 6 h to get Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 powder. SDC (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 ) powder was also prepared by the citric-nitrate process. Stoichiometric amounts of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R.) and Sm 2 O 3 (A.R.) were dissolved in diluted HNO 3 (A.R.) and citric acid (A.R.) was added as the complexant. The solution was evaporated and dried to form dry gel. The SDC powder was obtained by firing the dry gel at 750 \u00b0C for 2 h. The as-prepared powder of NiO and SDC was mixed in a weight ratio of 65:35 and ball-milled for 10 h using ethanol as media. To form sufficient porosity in the anode, 15 wt.% starch was added as the pore former. The mixed powders were pressed into pellets of 13 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The green pellets were pre-sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h to strengthen their mechanical property. The sintered pellets were used as the support for the fuel cells. The SDC ink for printing was made of SDC powder (55 wt.%) and ethyl cellulose-terpineol vehicle (45 wt.%). The SDC ink was screen-printed onto the pre-sintered NiO\u2013SDC anode substrates through a Terylene screen. The mesh count of the screen is 165 wires cm \u22121 and the wire diameter is 30 \u03bcm. The screen has an opening size of 30 \u03bcm and an open area of 25%. Three printing passes were needed to get an adequate thickness. After drying in air for 10 h, the anode-supported SDC electrolyte films were sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 . The Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode was also screen-printed onto the sintered SDC films and fired at 970 \u00b0C for 3 h. X-ray diffraction (Bede D 1 X-ray diffraction meter) was used to confirm the crystalline structure of the prepared powders. The microstructure and morphology of the screen-printed SDC films were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The cell performances were measured using a SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer in combination with an SI1287 electrochemical interface (Solartron Instruments, Hampshire, UK). A four-probe configuration was adopted in the electrochemical testing. Hydrogen (100 ml min \u22121 ) and dry methane (60 ml min \u22121 ) was used as fuel, respectively, while the ambient air was used as oxidant. 3 Results and discussion As shown in Fig. 1 , the as-prepared powder of NiO shows the expected phase structure without impurity phases. The X-ray pattern for Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 matches well with the diffraction data for a perovskite phase while the pattern for Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 shows the standard cubic fluorite structure. Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional microstructure of a single cell and the surface of a screen-printed SDC film. As can be seen from Fig. 2 a, the SDC film adheres well to both the Ni\u2013SDC anode substrate and the Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode. The SDC film is 12 \u03bcm thick with somewhat closed pinholes in cross-section. From Fig. 2 b, the SDC thin films are composed of grains of irregular shapes without obvious cracks or pinholes. Fig. 3 shows the performance of the single cell with a 12-\u03bcm-thick SDC film from 405 to 650 \u00b0C. When hydrogen (100 ml min \u22121 ) was used as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, the maximum power densities were 1280, 1080, 670, 370, 180 and 73 mW cm \u22122 at 650, 600, 555, 505, 455 and 405 \u00b0C, respectively. It is gratifying that the performance of the present cell at 600 \u00b0C is as high as that obtained with the state-of-the-art anode-supported YSZ film of SOFCs at 750\u2013800 \u00b0C. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the maximum power density between the present cell and prior reports. It can be seen that the present cell can provide the highest power density among the cells listed in Fig. 4 . Since the cells have similar structures, similar ceria-based electrolyte films and comparable film thickness, the distinct difference in power density can be ascribed to the cathode used. The present cell exhibits the highest power density, which implies that Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 possesses a better cathode performance at lower temperature than that for Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 and La 0.8 Sr 0.2 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 [11] . Fig. 5 shows the cell performance from 505 to 650 \u00b0C using dry methane as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The maximum power densities were 876, 568, 346 and 114 mW cm \u22122 at 650, 600, 555 and 505 \u00b0C, respectively. Xia et al. [15] operated a screen-printed SDC film (30 \u03bcm thick) SOFCs using moist methane as fuel and obtained the maximum power density of 304 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C. This value is obviously lower than our result. 4 Conclusion A 12-\u03bcm-thick Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 electrolyte film was successfully fabricated onto an anode substrate by screen-printing technology. Combined with a novel Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 cathode, a single cell of Ni\u2013SDC/SDC (12 \u03bcm)/Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 provided a maximum power density of 1080 mW cm \u22122 at 600 \u00b0C, using hydrogen as fuel and stationary air as oxidant. When dry methane was used as the fuel, the maximum power densities were 876 and 568 mW cm \u22122 at 650 and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. The power densities reported in this paper are obviously higher than prior reports on screen-printed doped-ceria film SOFCs. This initial cell performance indicates that, with an optimized cathode material, it is a realistic goal to fabricate a high performance SDC film SOFC capable of operating at low temperature using a low-cost screen-printing technology. Detailed investigations related to the fuel cell impedance, electrode polarization and long-term stability will be carried out in the near future.

        "abstract": "Composite materials Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF4)\u2013Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 (SDC) (BSCF4\u2013SDC) were prepared and characterized as cathode for intermediate temperature SOFC (IT-SOFC). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), electrical conductivity and electrochemical property measurement were employed to study the materials. The XRD result proved the reaction between BSCF4 and SDC in BSCF4\u2013SDC. The conductivity of BSCF4\u2013SDC was higher than that of BSCF4; in additions the thermal expansion coefficient of the BSCF4\u2013SDC was about 18% lower than BSCF4 from 30 to 800 \u00b0C in air. Polarization curves and impedance spectra measured at intermediate temperatures showed the BSCF4\u2013SDC electrode yielded lower resistance values than that of BSCF4 electrode. And the addition of 30 wt% SDC to BSCF4 had the best electrochemical properties; e.g., polarization resistance of BSCF4\u2013SDC30 was 0.298 \u03a9 cm 2 at 550 \u00b0C, which was nearly 85% lower than that of BSCF electrode. Keywords X-ray diffraction Ionic conduction Electronic transport Thermal analysis 1 Introduction High operating temperature of SOFC result in high cost and materials compatibility challenges, so low down the operating temperature of SOFC is the most important issue to settle for its practical use [1,2] . It has been found that, during intermediate temperature, the performance of cathode tends to limit the cell's performance. Thus, optimization of cathode material and performance is essential [3\u20137] . The Co-based pervoskite oxides are good candidates for IT-SOFC because of their high conductivity and good electrochemistry performance. Particular those substituted with Sr and Fe on A and B site, respectively, designated generically as LSCF, are known to show suitable stability ranges, and to possess good performance in air at intermediate temperatures [8] . To improve the performance of LSCF further, Perry Murray et al. added Ce 0.8 Gd 0.2 O 3 (GDC) to LSCF obtained LSCF-GDC, and succeeded [9] . Then, recently, Shao and Halle [10] presented Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF) as a new cathode material for reduced-temperature SOFC operation, which demonstrated excellent performance in both dual-chamber and single-chamber configurations at temperatures lower than 600 \u00b0C. The high power output of BSCF cathode resulted from the high rate of oxygen diffusion through the material, and this material was first developed as a high-temperature (>800 \u00b0C) oxygen permeation material. Unlike typical cathode, the A-site cations of BSCF perovskite are all alkaline earth species rather than rare earth and an alkaline earth element [11,12] . Although the performance of BSCF is good, there are still some problems in use for IT-SOFC cathode. First, Similar to other Co-based materials, the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of BSCF is extraordinary high, with the value of about 19.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 in air from 50 to 900 \u00b0C [13] . So the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient between the BSCF cathode and Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 (SDC) electrolyte make it hard to attach the cathode to electrolyte. Second, the electrical conductivity of BSCF is lower than the commonly used cathode, which may influence the electrochemical performance. Against this background, composite of BSCF-SDC are studied roundly focusing on the key properties, such as minish the problem of thermal expansion mismatch, improve the adhesion of the electrode to the electrolytes, as well as enhance the electrical conductivity. In this paper, the Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF4) cathode was modified by incorporating an amount of SDC to get a series of composite materials BSCF4\u2013SDC. Then the composite materials were investigated in comparison with pure BSCF4 on electrical conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient, as well as electrochemical properties toward SDC electrolyte. 2 Experimental 2.1 Material preparation Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSCF4) powders were synthesized by sol\u2013gel method. The appropriate metal nitrates were dissolved in water, and a combination of EDTA and citric acid served as complexing agents. Mild heating induced gelation of solution, and the resulting gel was held at 200 \u00b0C for several hours to remove organics. And then the primary powders were calcined at 950 \u00b0C for 5 h [10\u201314] . The composite materials BSCF4\u2013SDC prepared by incorporating SDC into BSCF4, milled with an agate mortar for 1h, were identified by the weight of added SDC (10, 20, 30 and 40 wt%), noted as BSCF4\u2013SDC_ x ( x = 10, 20, 30, 40). X-ray (Bede Scientific, D 1 X-ray diffractometer, UK, Cu K\u03b1 radiation, \u03bb = 0.15418 nm; operated at 40 kV, 45 mA;) diffraction analysis was employed to identify materials\u2019 crystal structure, the 2 \u03b8 \u2013 \u03b8 scans were carried out from 20\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 with a step of 0.02\u00b0 and a scan speed of 1.2\u00b0 min \u22121 . The thermal expansion measurements (pressed bar 6.00 mm in diameter and about 6.70 mm in length, sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 4 h) were conducted with a Netzsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer, using fused silica sample holder, from 30 to 800 \u00b0C (operated in air, heating rate: 5 K min \u22121 , air purge, flow rate: 50 ml min \u22121 ). Uniaxially pressed pellets of SDC (13 mm in diameter; 0.5 mm in thickness) powders was calcined at 1150 \u00b0C for 5 h. To improve the adhesion of interface, the surface of SDC pellet was coarsened by spraying a SDC layer then sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 5 h in air. The powder mixture BSCF4\u2013SDC dispersed in terpineol was spread on the coarsened electrolyte surface, and then sintered at 1050 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. The microstructures of the composite electrodes/electrolyte were studied with SEM (Hitachi, S-570). 2.2 Electrical and electrochemical characterization The conductivity of BSCF4 and BSCF4\u2013SDC sintered at 1100 \u00b0C (relative density about 90%) for 4 h was tested by the four-probe method, which carried out on a Keithley 2400 digital source meter and an AI 708 temperature meter controlled by computer through GPIB and RS-485 interfaces, respectively, from 50 to 850 \u00b0C. The electrochemical performances were investigated with three-electrode method. Prepared cathode on SDC was used as working electrode (WE) and reference electrode (RE), while counter electrode was arranged on the other side of the electrolyte disk using silver paste by pyrolysis. The polarization curves were measured using Electrochemical Interface (SI 1287) with potentiodynamic mode and the IR compensation was carried out with current interrupt method to take out the Ohm polarization. Impedance measurements were performed using an Impedance/Gain-phase Analyzer (SI 1260) with condition of 10 mV AC signal, 0.1 Hz to 910 kHz frequencies. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase construction The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BSCF4 powder calcined at 950 \u00b0C and BSCF4\u2013SDC30 calcined at 1000 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 1 . It is known that the BSCF4 was of single phase with a cubic perovskite structure [14] . However, the BSCF4\u2013SDC30 was not of single phase but a mixture with additional impurity phases. There were new peak appearing in the pattern of BSCF4\u2013SDC30, and the main peaks for BSCF4 in the BSCF4\u2013SDC30 shift obviously to the high angle direction indicating the shrinking of lattice parameter. At the same time, the SDCs peak at 28.36\u00b0 also shift to 28.60\u00b0, which can be seen clearly in the magnified XRD pattern for the Bragg angle range of 27\u00b0 \u2264 2 \u03b8 \u2264 35\u00b0 ( Fig. 1 b). It means that some Sm 3+ ion left ceria lattice since the lattice constant of Sm doped ceria (SDC) is larger than that of undoped ceria [15] . We concluded that BSCF4 reacted with SDC during the sintering process; the conceivable condition maybe: some Sm 3+ ion left SDC, gone to the lattice of BSCF4 forming the layer sequence perovskite [16\u201318] . The exact crystal structure of the production will be studied seriously in the further work. 3.2 Electrical conductivity Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity of sintered BSCF4, SDC and the BSCF4\u2013SDC. As can be seen, at low temperature (\u223c400 \u00b0C), the Arrhenius relationship curves of the entire sample were almost liner, but there were obvious inflections appeared at 400\u2013500 \u00b0C, and then the curves became flat. In addition, the conductivity of BSCF4\u2013SDC was higher than the pure BSCF4 and SDC at all temperatures. As a mix conductor, the total conductivity of BSCF4 involves an electronic and an ionic conductivity term, due to the presence of holes and oxygen vacancies. The ionic conductivity is lower than electronic nearly one magnitude; it is reasonable to assume that the measured values mainly refer to the former one. The conductivity can be believed to occur by the hopping of P-type small polarons, associated with the behaviors of tetravalent state of cobalt and iron cations [14] . Under lower temperature (<400 \u00b0C), the charge transfer is thermally activated, with the temperature dependence given by the equation: (1) \u03c3 = A T exp \u2212 E a k T where E a is activation energy for hopping. The inflection on the Arrhenius plots at 400\u2013500 \u00b0C were attributed to the oxygen loss during the temperature rising up and the thermal reduction of Co 4+ and Fe 4+ [14] . The conductivity of the BSCF4\u2013SDC involves the contribution of BSCF4 and SDC. As an ionic conductor, the conductivity of SDC is lower than the mixed conductor BSCF4 (as shown in Table 1 ); hence BSCF4 plays the main role for the conductivity of BSCF4\u2013SDC. For BSCF4\u2013SDC, part Sm 3+ diffused from SDC into the BSCF4, as proved by XRD result influenced the conductivity. The introduction of Sm 3+ hoisted the average valence of A-site in BSCF4 thus induced the reduction of Co and Fe ions in B-site to maintain the electrical neutrality, and then enhanced the conductivity. To make sure the role of Sm 3+ , Sm 3+ was brought in the A-site of BSCF4 straightly to get (Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 ) 0.8 Sm 0.2 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3\u2212 \u03b4 (BSSCF). As expected, the conductivity of BSSCF is higher than that of BSCF4 ( Fig. 2 ), which confirm the transfer of Sm 3+ , increased the concentration of carrier, and the electrical conductivity was enhanced [15,16] . The specific conductivity values at various temperature points are listed in Table 1 . The maximum conductivity for BSCF4\u2013SDC appeared at about 400 \u00b0C differing from that of BSCF4 at about 600 \u00b0C. Among all the samples, BSCF4\u2013SDC20 showed the highest conductivity. The conductivity of BSCF4\u2013SDC with mixed conductor (BSCF4) and ionic conductor (SDC) is influenced by such factors: the conductivity of each component, the ratio of them and the microstructure. With the increasing of SDC (ionic conductor) ratio, the ionic conductivity of composite material is increasing, while the electronic conductivity arose by BSCF4 is decreasing with the reduction of BSCF4 ratio. The synthetically effect is the BSCF4\u2013SDC20 having the highest conductivity [19\u201321] 3.3 TEC measurements Fig. 3 gives out the thermal expansion results, and Table 2 list the specific TEC values. It can be seen, similar to other Co-based materials, the TECs of BSCF4 were extraordinary high, with the value of about 19.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 K \u22121 in air from 30 to 800 \u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 3 , there were inflections for all these curves. Inflection of BSCF4 was found at about 510 \u00b0C, while the ones of the BSCF4\u2013SDC were at about 300 \u00b0C. The occurrence of inflection points might attribute to the loss of lattice oxygen and the formation of oxygen vacancies corresponding to the phenomenon of electrical conductivity related. For the BSCF4\u2013SDC, as seen in Table 2 , the addition of SDC lowered the TECs; e.g., the BSCF4\u2013SDC40 lowered the thermal expansion coefficient about 18%. Thus the composite material BSCF4\u2013SDC reduced the thermal expansion mismatch problem of BSCF4 as expected. 3.4 Microstructure characterization The microstructures of the composite electrodes on SDC electrolyte were studied by SEM. Fig. 4 a shows SEM micrographs of the fractured surface of composite BSCF4\u2013SDC30 layer sintered at 1050 \u00b0C on a SDC electrolyte. The thickness of the electrode layer is 20\u201325 \u03bcm. According to the SEM micrographs, porous electrodes are apparent, while the SDC electrolyte is dense. It is also obvious that the composite electrode is not a uniform mixture of fine particles where the two oxides are separated completely from each other, but is, more likely, an agglomerate mixture of the two components. As expected the adhesion of the composite to the SDC electrolyte is excellent due to the addition of SDC minish the problem of thermal expansion mismatch. Fig. 4 b shows the microstructure of the BSCF4\u2013SDC30 with mass pore, which ensure the transport of gas [22] . 3.5 Influences of SDC addition on the cathode properties Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of BSCF4 and BSCF4\u2013SDC electrodes on SDC electrolyte, which contains two parts. The left arc (high frequency) is contribution of Ohm polarization, including the effective resistance between reference electrode and working electrode, the DC resistance of leads and electrode, then the right arc (low frequency) is due to electrode polarization resistance, including the charge transfer resistance of electrochemical reaction at electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, and the equivalent resistance for the oxygen adsorption, decomposition and mass transfer. The equivalent circuit is presented in Fig. 6 . The elements of the equivalent circuit correspond to the electrochemical process. R 1 corresponds to the resistance of Ohm polarizaton, R 2 corresponds to the resistance of charge-transfer process through the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface, and W 1 \u2212 R corresponds to the impedance of diffusion, while the CPE 1 \u2212 T corresponds to the capacitance of the whole electrode. The fitting results of impedance spectra for various materials at 550 \u00b0C are shown in Table 3 . R el , the summation of R 2 and W 1 \u2212 R is considered to be the total polarization resistance of electrode. It is obvious the R el of BSCF4\u2013SDC is lower than that of pure BSCF4. The decreasing of resistance is due to the following reasons. First, BSCF4 as one kind of mixed conductor contains ionic conductivity, thus the oxygen reduction occurs on not only the triple phase boundaries (TPBs) but also the surface of electrode. The adsorbed molecular oxygen is reduced to oxygen ions, and finally, diffuse towards the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface and electrolyte bulk. The diffusion is influenced by the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The addition of an ionic conducting phase (SDC) increases the concentration of total oxygen vacancies and the oxygen diffusion is improved, so the resistance is reduced. Second, part Sm 3+ diffuse from SDC into the BSCF4 hoist the average valence of A-site thus induce the reduction of Co and Fe ions in B-site. The change of valence from IV to III weakens the astriction to oxygen ions, so the diffusion of oxygen in BSCF4\u2013SDC becomes more easily. Third, the reduced thermal expansion mismatch problem improved the adhesion between the electrodes and electrolytes, thus optimized the electrochemistry performance of BSCF4\u2013SDC. In this study, the composition of BSCF4\u2013SDC30 gave the best performance; e.g., at 550 \u00b0C, the decrease in R el relative to pure BSCF4 was about seven times for BSCF4\u2013SDC30. The present results had the best R el value of 0.298 \u03a9 cm 2 (550 \u00b0C), obviously better than in Refs. [9,21] where the similar composite cathode LSCF-GDC had the R el value of \u223c0.6 \u03a9 cm 2 at 590 \u00b0C. Fig. 7 shows the current density j versus the overpotential \u03b7 of various electrodes at 550 \u00b0C. As can be seen, the polarization current density under same overpotential varied with SDC ratio markedly, and the current density was enhanced by the addition of SDC, with the SDC ratio of 30 wt% showing the maximum current density, which was agree with the results of impedance spectra. The development of a series of new cathodes by mixing a mixed conducting phase (BSCF4) with an ionic conducting phase (SDC) results in a significant improvement on the electrochemical properties. And the contents of SDC have influence on the results. For example, the resistance of the BSCF4\u2013SDC varied markedly from 550 to 750 \u00b0C, with the SDC ratio of 30 wt% showed the minimum at all temperature. Fig. 8 shows the relation between the electrode resistance and content of SDC. It is apparent that the resistances of BSCF4\u2013SDC were not always reduced with the increasing of SDC, the electrochemical properties of BSCF4\u2013SDC, such as the resistance, were especially sensitive not only to the amount of each phase, but also to the degree which phase were connected to. Similar conclusions have been obtained in SSC\u2013SDC and LSCF\u2013GDC composite system [21,23] . 4 Conclusion Incorporating an amount of Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9 (SDC) to Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3 (BSCF4) to get a series of composite materials BSCF4\u2013SDC. Then the composite materials were investigated in comparison with simple BSCF4 on electrical conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, as well as electrochemical properties. The X-ray result indicated the reaction between BSCF4 and SDC during the sintering process that is the Sm 3+ cations diffused from SDC into BSCF4. The diffusion of Sm 3+ enhanced the conductivity of BSCF4 as expected. And the addition of SDC also lowered the TECs of BSCF4 sharply and reduced the problem of thermal expansion mismatch. The polarization curves and impedance spectra results showed that the composite materials BSCF4\u2013SDC exhibited better electrochemical performance than the pure BSCF4. All things considered, the composite containing 30 wt% SDC (BSCF4\u2013SDC30) with the lowest polarization resistance (1/7 of the pure BSCF4) is a promising material for IT-SOFC based on SDC electrolytes, whose stability and performance on single cell will be investigated in the future.

The open circuit voltage was over 1.1 V, and the output power density was about 33\u201343 mW/cm 2 at 900\u00b0C. Altering the fuel gas between H 2 and city coal gas shows that the output voltage and power are affected by fuel, and the response of fuel cell to the fuel gas is rapid. When pitch exists in the fuel gas, a tar-liked carbon is deposited on the Al 2 O 3 tubes of the cell but not on the anode. It has been proved that the anode with Cu has a self-cleaning function.",

The diverse pressure dependencies of several representative Raman bands are explained using a competitive mechanism involving bond length changes and vibronic coupling. It is therefore concluded that (a) the in-phase C=C stretching mode plays an essential role in the conversion of energy from S1 to S0 states in carotenoids, (b) internal conversion and intramolecular vibrational redistribution can be accelerated by high pressure, and (c) the environmental effect, but not the structural distortion or \u03c0-electron derealization, is responsible for the spectral properties of a given carotenoid species. These findings revealed the potential of high pressure in exploring the nature of the biological functions of carotenoids. \u00a9 2007 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "The structural, magnetic, and magnetoresistance properties of the double-perovskite series Sr2 Fe1-x Alx MoO6 (0\u2264x\u22640.30) were systematically investigated in order to clarify the influence of nonmagnetic Al ions on the magnetoresistance. The structural refinements of these samples show that the degree of cationic order increases gradually from 88.5% for x=0 to 92% for x=0.30 without any change in the crystal structure. The magnetization measurements reveal that the substitution of nonmagnetic Al ion for Fe ion enhances the magnetic moment per Fe ion significantly. In addition, the magnetic-field dependence of magnetization and magnetoresistance of these Sr2 Fe1-x Alx MoO6 samples were all fitted excellently by taking into account the contributions from ferromagnetic-coupled Fe-O-Mo region and nonferromagnetic- coupled regions. The fitting results indicate that the low-field magnetoresistance can be greatly enhanced due to the separation of the cationic-ordered Fe-O-Mo regions by the paramagnetic Mo-O-Al-O-Mo chains introduced through Al doping. Furthermore, doping nonmagnetic Al ions also suppress the formation of antiferromagnetic Fe-O-Fe antiphase boundaries, and then lead to the improvement of cation ordering and the reduction of magnetoresistance under high field. \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics.",

        "title": "Preparation of YSZ film by EPD and its application in SOFCs",
        "abstract": "An electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method was applied for the preparation of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin film on a NiO\u2013YSZ porous anode substrate for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications. Dense YSZ film with uniform thickness can be readily prepared with the EPD method using isopropanol as solvent and iodine as dispersant. As EPD electrode, the NiO\u2013YSZ substrate was covered with a graphite layer to obtain enough electric conductivity. A series of experiments, such as suspension concentration, sintering shrinkage, and so on, were conducted in order to optimize the EPD technique. A planar-type SOFC was fabricated using La 0.4 Sr 0.6 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 (LSCF) as the cathode and YSZ film deposited onto the NiO\u2013YSZ anode substrate as the electrolyte. The fuel cell exhibited an open circuit voltage of about 1.0 V and a maximum power density of 440 mW/cm 2 at 900 \u00b0C. Thus, the EPD method was a suitable technology for the formation of gas-tight YSZ film. Keywords Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) YSZ films SOFC 1 Introduction Recently the research of SOFC operating at intermediate temperature becomes more popular [1\u20135] . Two effective methods can be used to reduce the operating temperature of SOFC from conventional range of 800\u20131000 \u00b0C down to intermediate temperature (500\u2013800 \u00b0C). One is to use alternative electrolyte materials with higher ionic conductivity at lower temperature [6] , and the other is to use the thin film technology of conventional electrolyte\u2014yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The latter is often adopted. There are many techniques applied to produce YSZ films. In these techniques, wet processes are especially attractive because of the low cost and mass productivity [7] . Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a noble wet process. The EPD technique was firstly proposed by Ishihara et al. for fabrication of SOFCs [8] . In EPD process, charged particles dispersed in a stable suspension are driven by a dc electric field to move towards an oppositely charged electrode, upon which they ultimately deposit and build up a closely packed particulate layer [9] . The advantages of EPD for SOFC are listed: (1) EPD makes it possible to fabricate the SOFC cells with any types of shapes; (2) Both dense and porous films can be prepared by regulating deposition rates and subsequent sintering processes; (3) It is easy to stack electrode and electrolyte layers; (4) Co-deposition is possible to prepare composite layers such as Ni-YSZ anodes, etc. In this paper, EPD technique was used to prepare YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) film on porous anode substrate (NiO/YSZ). In this process, isopropanol was used as solvent and iodine as dispersant in YSZ suspension. The zeta potential of YSZ particles was studied by changing the amount of iodine. The effect of the amount of iodine and the concentration of YSZ suspension on the deposition weight was also studied. The prepared YSZ film and the anode substrate were then co-sintered at 1400 \u00b0C. The performance of a single SOFC, for which the YSZ film prepared by EPD process was applied, was tested. The short circuit current density and the maximum power density were 2.08 A/cm 2 and 440 mW/cm 2 at 900 \u00b0C, respectively. 2 Experimental The anode materials (NiO\u2013YSZ) were prepared by mixing YSZ powder (China building material academy, Beijing, China), NiO powder (made by ourselves) and amylums (commercial) by a weight ratio of 5:5:1. The purpose of adding amylums was to form more pores in anode. The mixture was milled in agate mortar for 1 h. Then, the mixed powders were pressed into pellets with a diameter of about 13 mm and a thickness of about 0.6 mm. The pellets were subsequently baked at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h to form the porous NiO\u2013YSZ as substrate. Generally, the EPD substrate should have some electronic conductivity at room temperature. However, the conductivity of NiO\u2013YSZ is too low to be used as electrode of EPD, in this paper, a graphite film was prepared on NiO\u2013YSZ pellets as conductive reagent, and it would be burnt out during the subsequent calcining process. YSZ suspension was obtained by dispersing YSZ powders (TZ-8Y, Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and iodine into isopropanol. In a typical deposition, 0.8 g YSZ and 0.04 g I 2 were added to a 100 ml beaker with 80 ml isopropanol. The mixture was sonicated with a high intensity ultrasonic probe for 10 min to form a stable suspension. The zeta potential of YSZ suspension was measured using a micro-electrophoretic instrument (JS94G + ). The experimental arrangement for EPD is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 . NiO/YSZ substrate with a layer of graphite connected with the negative output of EPD power source was hung in the deposition cell as the cathode, while a graphite disk was placed on the opposite side of the cell acting as the anode. The two electrodes were kept parallel with a distance of 6 mm. With a constant deposition voltage of 10 V, positively charged YSZ particles were electrophoretically deposited onto the cathode and YSZ film was formed in 1 h. The green YSZ film was dried in open air for about 12 h and then co-sintered with the substrate at 1400 \u00b0C for 2 h. The sintering curves of pressed bars with powders of YSZ electrolyte and NiO\u2013YSZ anode were measured utilizing a Netzsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer (Netzsch GmbH, Germany) with air purging (flow rate: 50 ml/min). In this measurement, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 K/min, and from 500 to 900 \u00b0C at 10 K/min, then being held at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h, finally raised the temperature to 1300 \u00b0C at 10 K/min and being held at 1300 \u00b0C for 2 h. The surface and cross-section of the sintered YSZ film was characterized using a SEM (Hitachi S-570 scanning electron microscope). La 0.4 Sr 0.6 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 (LSCF) powder was synthesized by solid-state reaction method. Some adhesives were mixed with the powders to form slurry. The slurry was applied on the exposed surface of the YSZ film and then fired at 300 \u00b0C for 30 min to burn out the adhesives. Finally the sample was sintered at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h to obtain a positive-electrolyte-negative (PEN) component (NiO\u2013YSZ/YSZ/LSCF). To make a single fuel cell, a PEN component was sealed onto one end of ceramic tubes ( Fig. 2 ) as the method mentioned in Ref. [10] . The silver layer on both electrode surfaces made from silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai Research Institute of Synthetic Resin, Shanghai, China) was used as current collectors to collect current on both anode and cathode. Thus, a single fuel cell was prepared and to be tested. In the process of fuel cell testing, the hydrogen was used as fuel and the oxygen in air was used as oxidant. The anode chamber was purged with nitrogen below 500 \u00b0C, and the nitrogen was changed to the fuel gas (H 2 ) at 500 \u00b0C. The performances of the single fuel cell were measured using Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface (Solartron Instruments, Hampshire, England). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Electrophoretic deposition of YSZ The thickness of prepared YSZ film was lie on the deposited weight of YSZ in EPD process. In the initial period of EPD process, the weight ( w ) of charged particles deposited per unit area of electrode substrate is expressed as the following equation [8] , ignoring the charge carried by the free ions: (1) w = 2 3 C \u03b5 0 \u03b5 r \u03b6 \u03b7 \u2212 1 E L \u2212 1 t where C represents the concentration of the suspension, \u025b 0 the permittivity of vacuum, \u025b r the relative permittivity of the solvent, \u03b6 the zeta potential of the particles in suspension, \u03b7 the viscosity of the solvent, E the applied potential, L the distance between electrodes, and t is the deposition period. Eq. (1) suggests that zeta potential of the particles is an important parameter in EPD process. The value of zeta potential is related with the solvent and the concentration of the dispersant [11] . In this study, isopropanol was used as solvent and the iodine was used as dispersant. The zeta potential of YSZ particles in isopropanol was plotted against the amount of dispersant (iodine) in Fig. 3 . Although the zeta potential of YSZ particles is only 2 mV in pure isopropanol, the value of \u03b6 increases as the I 2 concentration increases and a maximum potential of 15 mV is attained at 0.5 g/l. The phenomenon suggests that protons (H + ) are formed by the reaction between I 2 and isopropanol: (2) I 2 + 2(CH 3 ) 2 CHOH \u2192 2(CH 3 ) 2 CHOI + 2H + The protons are absorbed by the YSZ particles, and subsequently, the YSZ particles become positively charged. Corresponding to the change of zeta potential, the amount of YSZ deposited on the substrate changed. The amount of YSZ deposited at 10 V for 1 h versus the concentration of I 2 was shown in Fig. 4 . When the concentration of I 2 was 0.5 g/l, the weight of YSZ deposited on the substrate was the maximum. Therefore, the YSZ suspension with an I 2 concentration of 0.5 g/l was used in this study. From Eq. (1) we can also conclude that the deposition weight of YSZ particles is directly proportional to the concentration of YSZ suspension when the applied potential and the deposition time are constant. Fig. 5 shows the amount of YSZ deposited on the substrate at 10 V for 1 h as a function of the YSZ particle concentration in the suspension with I 2 concentration kept at 0.5 g/l. The weight of deposited YSZ increased linearly with the increase of the YSZ concentration when the YSZ concentration was below 20 g/l, but it reduced at higher YSZ concentration. It was also found that the YSZ concentration higher than 10 g/l resulted in poor quality non-uniform green YSZ films. This was probably due to the agglomeration of YSZ particles at high YSZ concentration and the high deposition rate, leading to poor packing density of the green film. However, if the YSZ concentration in the suspension was smaller than 5 g/l, the deposition rate was very slow. Therefore, the concentration of YSZ particles was kept at 10 g/l in this study to ensure both enough deposition rate and uniform green YSZ films with smooth surfaces. 3.2 Sintering shrinkage characteristic of YSZ electrolyte and NiO\u2013YSZ anode Fig. 6 shows the sintering curves of YSZ electrolyte and NiO\u2013YSZ anode. A typical sintering curve usually includes two segments. One segment is expanding, and the other is shrinking. At lower temperature, the sample expands with temperature increasing and shows positive thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), over a certain temperature, and TEC changes to negative and the shrinkage begin. According to the sintering curves, such parameters, e.g. TEC, starting shrinkage temperature, shrinkage rate and the total shrinkage ratio (sintering step) can be obtained easily. From Fig. 6 , it can be seen that the starting shrinkage temperature was almost the same but the total shrinkage ratio of YSZ electrolyte was larger than that of NiO\u2013YSZ anode. This mismatch would produce stress during co-sintering process and some cracks in electrolyte film might be formed. So the co-sintering process should be controlled carefully. 3.3 Microstructure characterization of the YSZ films Fig. 7 shows the scanning electron micrographs of a tested fuel cell. According to the cross-section micrograph, the anode and cathode are porous and the electrolyte film is relative dense with few close pores. At the same time, the thickness of cathode and electrolyte are 12 \u00b1 1 and 17 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm, respectively. It can be seen that the YSZ film prepared by EPD technique was sintered well, namely, there is few pin-holes in the film region in both the surface and the cross-section micrographs. The grains were sintered together with clear boundaries. The porosity calculated by analyzing the SEM photo is below 1%. 3.4 Properties of fuel cell Fig. 8 shows the performance of the single fuel cell. The maximum open circuit voltage was 0.97 V at 800 \u00b0C. It was less than the theoretical one (about 1.23 V). This difference should be attributed to the open holes existed in the YSZ film. A small amount fuel may leak out through these holes and the potential of cathode may become a mixed potential that is lower than that of a pure air electrode. In addition, the shrinkage of YSZ film and NiO\u2013YSZ anode substrate was different during sintering process, which would produce too large stress between the YSZ film and the anode substrate to form a few cracks which would influence the performances of the cell, not only the open circuit voltage, but also the current density and the power density. The short circuit current density and power density of this fuel cell were 2.08 A/cm 2 and 440 mW/cm 2 at 900 \u00b0C, 1.70 A/cm 2 and 390 mW/cm 2 at 850 \u00b0C, 1.28 A/cm 2 and 282 mW/cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C, respectively. 4 Conclusion Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is an economical colloidal process. Furthermore, a simple apparatus is sufficient to realize EPD method. The present results show a dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thin film can be easily obtained using EPD in an isopropanol and iodine solution, followed by sintering at a temperature of 1400 \u00b0C. In particular, YSZ powder can be deposited on NiO\u2013YSZ substrate with a graphite layer, therefore, the reaction between (La, Sr)MnO 3 cathode and YSZ was avoided at higher temperature in co-sintering process when LaSrMnO 3 was used as the substrate. The thickness of resulting film can be readily controlled by the applied potential and the deposition time. This study revealed that the EPD method is one of the promising methods for the preparation of YSZ electrolyte film for solid oxide fuel cells.

The content of Cu in the NCs can be easily controlled by adjusting the concentration of precursor and synthesis time. Using photocatalytic degradation of monoazo dye Procion Red MX-5B (PR) and phenol as the probe molecules under visible-light illumination, we have investigated the influence of Cu on the photocatalytic activity of Cu 2 O.

        "abstract": "Nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was synthesized by a homogeneous precipitation process using urea as the precipitation agent. The effects of powders calcinations temperature on the phase evolution, crystalline sizes and electrical properties were investigated. Characterizations revealed that crystallization started at about 773 K. Finely dispersed and weakly agglomerated nanocrystalline YSZ with the average crystalline size of 7 nm was obtained. During heating, a better crystallization and enhanced crystallite growth was observed. Sintering curves revealed that a densification process appeared in the temperature range of 773\u20131573 K with a well-defined maximum of shrinkage rate at around 1411 K. Raman scattering results at room temperature suggested that the major phase was cubic, and the minor one was tetragonal. On reducing the calcinations temperature of powders, the sintered ceramic density increased, corresponding to an increase in the pre-exponential factor and the conductivity. Keywords Nanostructured materials Ceramics Chemical synthesis Ionic conduction 1 Introduction Over the past years, nanomaterials have attracted more and more interest because of their extensive applications. Due to the reduction of grain size, the optical, electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties of nanomaterials have been changed drastically, and the sintering behavior of nanomaterials can also be influenced. For example, the sintering temperature of nanomaterials is about 200 K lower than that of microcrystalline materials [1,2] . With lowering the sintering temperature, energy is saved and new opportunities are provided for fabricating advanced devices. Due to the small grain size, nanomaterials offer new fields in application for microtechnology, surface coating for electronic devices and energy storage and conversion such as for the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) [3,4] . Due to its nearly pure oxygen ionic conductivity and excellently mechanical properties, stabilized zirconia has been actively investigated and used in various applications such as oxygen sensors to monitor oxygen content in a gas mixture, oxygen pumps to generate controlled oxygen partial pressures and SOFCs to produce energy [5\u20137] . Many methods have been developed to synthesize nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powders [8\u201311] . Homogeneous precipitation process [12\u201316] has been widely used to produce monodisperse metal oxide particles of various shapes and sizes. If the precipitation agent is added directly by simply pouring one solution into another, then there is little control of the chemistry reaction during precipitation because of the large and inhomogeneous gradients in solution concentration. However, a better control of chemical and morphological characteristics can be achieved if the precipitating ligands are generated simultaneously and uniformly throughout the solution, i.e. a homogeneous precipitation process. In this study, weakly agglomerated nanocrystalline YSZ was synthesized by homogeneous precipitation method. The objective of this work is to investigate the change of crystal structure, phase evolution, grain size and sintering behavior of YSZ nanomaterial induced by the different powders calcinations temperature. Especially, to provide a basis for comparison, the electrical properties of the sintered YSZ samples are assessed as a function of the measuring temperatures and the as-synthesized powders calcinations temperature. 2 Experimental 2.1 Nanocrystalline YSZ preparation Y 2 O 3 (99.9%) was firstly dissolved into a certain amount of nitric acid. ZrOCl 2 \u00b78H 2 O (99.0%) was dissolved into deionized water and mixed with the yttrium nitrate solution. This mixed solution was added to urea (99.0%) solution, and then diluted to the ZrO 2+ concentration of 0.05 mol/l and stirred uniformly. The stoichiometric solutions (molar ratio 4:23 of Y 3+ :Zr 4+ corresponding to 8% mol yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were transferred to a Teflon cup, and then put into a stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 358 K for 1 h to generate hydrogel precipitation. The hydrogel precipitation was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water repeatedly, and then dried overnight in an oven at 358 K in air, finally calcined at different temperatures for 2 h. 2.2 Characterization The crystalline structures were identified at room temperature by powder X-ray diffractometer (Bede Scientific D 1 , operated at 40 kV, 45 mA), employing Cu K\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 1.5418 \u00c5). The average crystalline size was estimated according to the Scherrer equation [17] . Raman spectra were obtained with a HR800 integrated Raman system (Jobin-Yvon) at room temperature whose excitation source was a He-Ne ion laser of 632 nm. The grain size and morphology of the samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM JEOL JEM-1200EX working at 100 kV). Sintering procedure was performed in air at a heating rate of 10 K/min. The calcined powders were die-pressed at 200 MPa uniaxially and then sintered at 1723 K for 4 h. The density was measured according to the Archimedes principle. A Hitachi S-570 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine the surface microstructure of sintered samples without any treatment. Ac impedances were measured between 0.1 Hz and 910 kHz with a frequency response analyzer using a computerized Solartron SI1260 Impedance Analyzer combination with a Solartron SI1287 electrochemical interface (EI). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 X-ray diffraction analysis Fig. 1 shows the phase evolution of the as-synthesized precursor and the powders calcined at different temperatures. The as-synthesized precursor and the powders calcined at 673 K are amorphous. Crystallization starts at about 773 K. During heating, a simultaneous growing and narrowing of the peaks is observed due to better crystallization and enhanced crystalline size. The evolution of the average crystallite sizes ( Fig. 2 ) was investigated during heating treatment. The crystallite sizes were calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the first strong reflection (111) using the Scherrer formula. Results show that the average crystalline size is about 7 nm at 773 K. As the temperature increases, the crystallite size increases very slowly up to 1173 K. The rapid crystalline size growth starts mainly at above 1173 K, and increases to an average crystalline size of 51 nm at 1273 K. Crystalline size growth is the process by which the average crystalline size of the material increases continuously during heat treatment in order to minimize interfacial surface energy. When the heating treatment temperature is above the critical temperature, the crystalline size will increase rapidly. This can be the explanation of the sudden increase in the crystalline size at 1273 K. After the powders are calcined at 1732 K, the crystalline size is larger than 100 nm, which is beyond the scope of Scherrer formula used. Smaller crystallite sizes come from the powders synthesized in the presence of the high precipitation agent concentration. The crystalline sizes of YSZ are affected, in fact, by the nucleation rate, which is in turn proportional to the precipitation agent concentration. Thus, the higher the precipitation agent concentration reaches, the higher the nucleation rate will be, and then the smaller particle sizes result. 3.2 Raman scattering According to the X-ray diffraction ( Fig. 1 ), it is difficult to observe the tetragonal splitting of zirconia at low calcinations temperature (below 1273 K) due to the broad peaks characteristic to nanometer crystallite sizes, and there is still no splitting observed from the reflection peaks at high calcinations temperature (1723 K). Raman scattering [18] , on the other hand, is one of the powerful tools for observing the cubic-tetragonal change induced by oxygen displacements. Compared with the powders calcined at 1723 K, the Raman spectrum (obtained at room temperature) ( Fig. 3 ) of the powders calcined at 773 K shows broadly and poorly developed peaks, and the positions of all the peaks are blue-shift. The broad peaks have been interpreted by the breakdown of the wave vector selection rule by translational disorder through random substitution of doped cations and anion vacancies [19] . Small size and quantum size effects of nanostructure materials can make bands vibrating frequency heighten and energy bands broaden, which can cause blue-shift of Raman peaks. The Raman scattering results suggest that cubic phase is formed as major phase with a broad band near 630 cm \u22121 together with a background profile as reported in the previous works [20,21] . However, the bands of about 260, 330 and 475 cm \u22121 were included in six broad bands predicted by group theory for the typical tetragonal phase [22] , demonstrating that the samples prepared by homogeneous precipitation contain the tetragonal structure as minor phase. The Raman peak area ratio of the peaks at about 475 and 630 cm \u22121 , excluding the background, was used to estimate the relative content of tetragonal to cubic phases. The ratio of S 475 / S 627 (0.17) from the sample calcined at 1723 K is lower than that of S 476 / S 635 (0.23) from the sample calcined at 773 K, indicating that the sample calcined at high temperature composes of higher concentration of cubic phase. Yashima et al. [23] reported that the existence of t\u2033-form tetragonal phase was difficult to distinguish from cubic phase by XRD pattern. Similar phenomena may have occurred in this study. A metastable phase (t\u2033-form), which is a tetragonal phase with an axis ratio of unity, has been believed to exist near the tetragonal-cubic phase boundary. The cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition is not induced by the elongation of c -axis and shrinkage of the a -axis but by the displacement of the oxygen ions along the c -axis from the ideal fluorite site [19,24] . The X-ray diffraction is not sensitive to the structural change induced by the oxygen displacement in zirconia, although the difference between a - and c -axis lengths can be obtained by this technique. 3.3 TEM analysis TEM analysis provides information about the size and shape of primary particles and their state of agglomeration. Particles (calcined at 773 K) obtained by homogeneous precipitation exhibit well-crystallized nanocrystalline of homogeneous and weakly agglomerated assembly with the primary particle size of about 7 nm ( Fig. 4 ). This is in good agreement with the powder X-ray diffraction result. Results also suggest that the crystallites have nearly spherical morphology. Theoretically, the good sinterability will be achieved if the ceramic powders consist of particles with small size and soft agglomerates. Weakly agglomerated powders are needed for both dry processing methods of powders compaction, and the preparation of stable suspensions in liquids for thin or thick film production. The weakly agglomerated nanocrystalline YSZ powders, which are obtained by homogeneous precipitation, can be feasible to fabricate advanced ceramic devices. 3.4 Sintering behavior Dynamic sintering curves of the YSZ sample (using the powders calcined at 773 K) are presented in Fig. 5 . During sintering, the pronounced shrinkage of the green body is observed above 761 K, which is close to the crystallization temperature of 773 K. The shrinkage rate of powder compact increases and exhibits a higher value at 940 K. With the decrease of the crystalline size growth rate (between 973 and 1173 K) ( Fig. 2 ), the corresponding shrinkage rate decreases slightly ( Fig. 5 ). Above 1173 K, the crystalline size increases greatly ( Fig. 2 ), which further prompts the shrinkage of powder compacts. The shrinkage rate exhibits the maximum at around 1411 K. The total shrinkage is about 16.45% after sintered to 1573 K holding for 2 h. The crystallization process is the procedure of nuclei formation to crystalline and particles growth. During sintering, the growth rate of particles increases, which accompanies the agglomeration among particles. This higher physical agglomeration of crystallites originates from higher surface energy of smaller crystallite that causes the shrinkage of the sample. 3.5 SEM analysis The surface microstructures of sintered pellets (1723 K for 4 h) using differently heat-treated powders (773\u20131273 K) are shown in Fig. 6 a\u2013e . Some small pores are observed when the sample sintered at 1723 K for 4 K using the powders calcined at 773 K whose average grain size is about 0.6 \u03bcm ( Fig. 6 a). As the powders calcinations temperature increase, the porosity of the correspondingly sintered samples (1723 K for 4 h) increased. Except from the sintered sample using the powders calcined at 1073 K ( Fig. 6 d) whose grain size is about 0.5 \u03bcm, the average grain sizes of other sintered samples increase with increasing the powders calcinations temperature, and increases to an average grain size of 2.1 \u03bcm using the powder calcined at 1273 K ( Fig. 6 e). The sintered sample using the powders calcined at 773 K represents the highest relative density (96.0%) ( Table 1 ). With increasing the powders calcinations temperature, the relative densities of the sintered samples decrease. The sintered samples using the powders calcined at 1073 and 1173 K achieve maxima of about 90.0%. The decreased relative density is ascribed to the higher porosity of the two samples. 3.6 Electrical property The electrical properties of the sintered YSZ pellets (1723 K), which used the as-synthesized powders calcined at different temperatures (773\u20131273 K), were investigated by impedance spectra at various measuring temperatures. The measuring temperature range of 923\u20131123 K was selected to simulate the operating temperatures of SOFCs used in general. Fig. 7 shows a typical Electrochemical Impedance Spectrum (EIS) response and its corresponding equivalent circuit for the sintered pellet (using the powders calcined at 773 K) measured at 1123 K in air conditions. The EIS responses of other measuring temperatures are similar to that at 850 \u00b0C. The high-frequency (47 kHz) intercept at the real axis gives the total electrolyte resistance, and the difference between the high-frequency and low-frequency intercepts at the real axis represents the silver electrode response. There is no grain boundary resistance arc resolved from the EIS response in the measuring temperature range of 923\u20131123 K in which the grain boundary resistance is negligible to the total electrolyte resistance. The measured conductivity data were analyzed according to the traditional Arrhenius equation [25] : (1) \u03c3 = \u03c3 0 T exp \u2212 E a K T where T is the absolute temperature, K the Boltzmann constant, E a the activation energy for conduction, and the pre-exponential factor \u03c3 0 is a material constant. Fig. 8 shows the Arrhenius plots for all calcined samples. Good linear relationships between ln( \u03c3T ) and 1/ T are observed. From the slope of the straight lines the activation energies can be deduced which represent the energy barrier for ionic movement during diffusion in the electrolyte. As indicated in Table 1 , all samples exhibit activation energies for conduction ( E a ) in the range of 0.95\u20131 eV, which are close to the values usually found for zirconia-based solid electrolytes [26] , indicating that the basic charge transport is identical in the studied samples. The temperature independent constant, \u03c3 0 , which is a function of the charge carrier concentration, shows similar change tendency to activation energy for ionic conductivity, E a . However, there is an obvious increase to the pre-exponential factor with decreasing the powders calcinations temperature ( Table 1 ). When the Y 3+ content retain constant, with increasing the density of sintered pellets using the powders calcined from 1273 to 773 K ( Table 1 ), the charge carrier concentration values increase, corresponding to the increase of \u03c3 0 . In fact, as seen from Eq. (1) , not only is the activation energy used to characterize the temperature-dependence of the measured conductivity for a given sample, the conductivity may also increase with the increase of \u03c3 0 on condition that E a remains constant. Therefore, it seems to be more reasonable to analyze the combined effects on the conductivity by considering the parameters of both the activation energy, E a , and the pre-exponential factor, \u03c3 0 . In the measuring temperature range of 923\u20131123 K, the conductivities of the three sintered samples using the powders calcined at 773, 873 and 973 K are pronounced higher than those of other sintered samples (using the powders calcined at 1073 and 1173 K). This result is due to the fact that the former possesses lower porosity ( Fig. 6 ) and higher relative density ( Table 1 ). The sintered YSZ pellets (1723 K) show increasingly relative densities with decreasing the calcinations temperature of powders used ( Table 1 ). The higher the relative density of YSZ pellet possesses, the higher the value of pre-exponential factor will be, leading to the higher charge carrier concentration, and then the enhanced conductivity results. When measured at 1173 K, the conductivity of the sintered sample using the powders calcined at 773 K is higher than those of the YSZ samples (measured at the same temperature) reported previously [27,28] . As shown in Fig. 7 , the conductivity for the sample of larger activation energy will increase more obviously with increasing the measuring temperatures than those of smaller activation energy. Slight enhancement of the activation energy is observed with decreasing the calcinations temperature of powders ( Table 1 ). The sintered sample using the powders calcined at 773 K shows the largest E a and \u03c3 0 values to other samples. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that, at the measuring temperatures higher than 1173 K, the conductivity of the sample using the powders calcined at 773 K will be even higher than those of other samples measured at the same temperature. 4 Conclusion By homogeneous precipitation method, finely dispersed and weakly agglomerated nanocrystalline YSZ with the average crystalline size of 7 nm was synthesized when the powders were calcined at 773 K. With increasing the calcinations temperature of powders, a better crystallization and enhanced crystalline size was observed, whereas the corresponding conductivities of the samples (sintered at 1723 K) decreased. Compared with other sintered samples (using the powders calcined at 873\u20131273 K), the sintered sample using the powders calcined at 773 \u00b0C represented the highest conductivity. This resulted from its enhanced density leading to the higher pre-exponential factor which was closely related to the charge carrier concentration.

        "abstract": "The effect of Fe doping (0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.10) in Mn site was studied for the colossal magnetoresistance material La5/6Na1/6MnO3. The same size of Fe3+ and Mn3+ causes no structure change in the series, yet conduction and ferromagnetism have been consistently suppressed by Fe doping. Doping with Fe causes no dominant lattice effects. It depopulates the hopping electrons and weakens the double exchange. ZFC and FC magnetization curve at 0.01 T field shows irreversibility. The temperature dependence of resistivity shows that all samples undergo a transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic with the decrease of temperature. However, for y = 0.10 sample, two obvious peaks are observed in the magnetoresistance versus temperature curve at 5 T field. The high-field MR effect may have its origin in a small canting of the manganese moments inside each domain even for H > Hs. The canting angle becomes smaller and therefore electrons transfer more easily between pairs of Mn3+ and Mn4+ions under high field. This will lead to a MR effect. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The microstructure and electrical properties of the samples sintered at different temperatures were studied using SEM and a.c. impedance spectroscopy. The effects of sintered density, grain and grain boundary on the electrical properties of samples were analyzed. The results show that the densification of samples increases gradually with increasing sintering temperatures. The microstructure of samples strongly influences their electrical properties, and with increasing sintered density, the electrical properties of samples are enhanced. The ionic conductivity of grain and grain boundary is improved as the sintering temperatures increase. The grain boundary resistance of samples sintered at 1650\u00b0C is higher than that of samples sintered at 1600\u00b0C. Better sinterability of samples was obtained at a sintering temperature of 1650\u00b0C.",

QSDs of Fe2+ and Fe3+ are attributed to Fe2+ and Fe3+ at the corresponding octahedrally coordinated sites in the crystal structures of the three phosphate minerals. The influence on the distortion of the M2 site by different next-nearest neighbor (NNN) configurations was discussed based on the Jahn\u2013Teller effect in purpurite, and the authors propose two M2 subsites with different distortions in purpurite. Two QSDs of Fe3+ in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of purpurite are tentatively assigned to Fe3+ at the two M2 subsites, and next-nearest neighbor (NNN) effects were used to interpret the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of purpurite.",

When the temperature is increased above 250 K, the resistance drops rapidly because the conduction path starts to switch from the Fe3 O4 film to the inversion layer underneath the Si O2 via thermally assisted tunneling. A greatly magnified low field negative magnetoresistance of Fe3 O4 is observed at 280 K. The effect is similar to a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. The magnetoresistance becomes positive with further increase in the magnetic field due to the Lorentz force and other effects on the carriers in the inversion layer. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

An isostructural phase transition starts at approximately 10 GPa. When pressure is higher than 13.5 GPa, Nd(O0.88F0.12)FeAs completely transforms to a high-pressure phase, which remains the same tetragonal structure with a larger a-axis and smaller c-axis than those of the low-pressure phase. The ambient conditions isothermal bulk moduli B0 are derived as 102(2) and 245(9) GPa for the low-pressure phase and high-pressure phase, respectively.

        "abstract": "Double perovskite Sr_2FeMoO_6 with Al doping at Fe site up to 30% were prepared by traditional solid-state reaction. The degree of the cation ordering of Sr_2FeMoO_6 increases with Al doping obviously as shown by the refinement of room-temperature X-ray diffraction. The saturated magnetic moment per formula unit of these compounds decreases gradually with increasing Al concentration, but the magnetic moment per Fe ion increases markedly, which is consistent with the improvement of cation ordering. Basing on the analysis of magnetic structure with Al doping, doping of Al will lead to the formation of non-magnetic coupled Mo\u2014O\u2014Al\u2014O\u2014Mo chains, which can divide the large Mo\u2014O\u2014Fe ferrimagnetic region into smaller patches and enhance the low field magnetoresistance. The formation of Fe\u2014O\u2014Fe antiphase boundaries are suppressed by the doping Al due to the improvement of the cation ordering, and the high field magnetoresistance that roots in spin-dependent scattering at the antiphase boundaries is reduced. Therefore, the total magnetoresistance reaches a maximum value at x=0.15.",

The diverse pressure dependencies of several representative Raman bands are explained using a competitive mechanism involving bond length changes and vibronic coupling. It is therefore concluded that (a) the in-phase C=C stretching mode plays an essential role in the conversion of energy from S1 to S0 states in carotenoids, (b) internal conversion and intramolecular vibrational redistribution can be accelerated by high pressure, and (c) the environmental effect, but not the structural distortion or pi-electron delocalization, is responsible for the spectral properties of a given carotenoid species.

It demonstrated that rare-earth co-doped Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 material prepared by the sol\u2013gel method could be easy to sinter at lower temperature dense ceramic electrolyte with better electrical property. Keywords SOFC Co-doped Ceria Electrolyte Sinter temperature 1 Introduction Doped ceria oxides have been extensively studied as one of the most promising electrolyte materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (ITSOFCs) [1,2] . These materials demonstrate much higher ionic conductivity at relatively lower temperatures in comparison to that of the traditional electrolyte yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). So far, many studies have been carried out on doped ceria and made much progress [3\u201311] . Some singly doped electrolytes, such as Ce 1\u2212 x Sm x O 2\u2212 y , Ce 1\u2212 x Gd x O 2\u2212 y , Ce 1\u2212 x Y x O 2\u2212 y , etc., show high oxide ion conductivity. Some co-doped ceria-based electrolytes have been investigated, such as (Ce (1\u2212 x \u2212 y ) La x M y )O 2\u2212 \u03b4 (M = Ca, Sr) [12] , (La 0.75 Sr 0.2 Ba 0.05 ) 0.175 Ce 0.825 O 1.891 , Ce 1\u2212 x \u2212 y Sm x Ca y O 2\u2212 z , Ce 1\u2212 x \u2212 y La x Sr y O 2\u2212 z [13] , Ce 1\u2212 a Gd a \u2212 y Sm y O 2\u22120.5 a [14] , Ce 1\u2212 x \u2212 y Gd x Pr y O 2\u2212 z [15] , Ce 0.85 Gd 0.1 Mg 0.05 O 1.9 [16] , Sm x Gd 0.2\u2212 x Ce 0.8 O 1.9 [17] , Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2\u2212 x Y x O 1.9 [18] , Ce 0.9 Ca 0.1\u2212 x Sr x O 1.9 [19] , etc., the results indicated that co-doping method was proved to be effective to improve the electrical property of the ceria-based electrolyte. In our previous work, the properties of the rare-earth co-doped Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 \u2212x Y x O 1.9 ( x = 0.0\u20130.20) electrolytes were studied [18] . The results displayed that the electrolyte, when x = 0.05 or 0.10, appeared higher conductivity and lower activation energy than the singly doped ceria with the same dopant concentration (20% trivalent rare earth) at the temperature range of 550\u2013700 \u00b0C. It suggested that the Ce 0.8 Sm 0.15 Y 0.05 O 1.9 and Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 electrolytes might be the better electrolytes for ITSOFCs. Preparation condition, especially sintering temperature and time, can affect the mechanical and electrical performance of electrolyte markedly. With the purpose to further optimize electrolyte and economize energy sources during the preparation, we studied the influence of the sintering temperature on electrical property of the Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 electrolyte. In this study, nano-scale rare-earth co-doped Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 powders were prepared by the sol\u2013gel method, the pellets were sintered at different temperatures and their electrical conductivity were characterized and compared. 2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation The sample with the general formula of Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 was synthesized by the sol\u2013gel method. Cerium nitrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O), containing CeO 2 (39 wt.%), yttria (99.99 wt.%), and samaria (99.5 wt.%) were used as starting materials. Cerium nitrate was dissolved in deionized water and the desired amounts of yttria and samaria were dissolved in nitrate solution, then they were mixed together with citric acid solution (the mole ratio of cation to citric acid was 1/1.2). The pH value of the mixed solution was adjusted with ammonia solution under continuous stirring at 70 \u00b0C and homogeneous sol was formed. With the evaporation of water, a yellow sponge-like gel was obtained, which was calcined at 800 \u00b0C to get the final composition powder. Then the dried powders were ground in an agate mortar and then pressed under a pressure of about 200 MPa into cylindrical pellets (13 mm in diameter and 0.6 mm in thickness). The pellets sintered at 1300, 1400, 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C in air for 9 h, respectively. 2.2 Properties measurement The crystal structure of the calcined oxide powders and pellets were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Bede D1 X-ray Diffractometer (monochromated Cu K\u03b1 radiation, ( = 0.15418 nm; operated at 40 KV, 45 mA) at room temperature, in the Bragg angle range of 20\u00b0 \u2264 2 \u03b8 \u2264 80\u00b0. The crystallite size, D , of the calcined powders was estimated using the Scherrer formula: D = 0.9 \u03bb /( \u03b2 cos \u03b8 ). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken on the intersection of the specimens using a Hitachi S-570 scanning electron microscope. 2.3 Electrical measurement The electrical conductivity of the materials was measured based on the sintered ceramic pellets. Silver paste (DAD-87 type) was used as electrodes on opposite sides of each pellet. The complex impedance spectra of the pellets were determined in air by ac four-probe measurements using a computerized Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer combination with a Solartron SI1287 electrochemical interface (EI) and the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 910 kHz. The measurements were conducted in the temperature range from 300 to 850 \u00b0C with an interval of 50 \u00b0C. The impedance spectra data were fitted with suitable equivalent circuit of the Z-View 2.0 software to distinguish the bulk resistance and grain-boundary resistance, then the conductivities were calculated. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase structure It is can be known from the former results [18] that the mean grain size of the Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 powder sample is homogeneous and about 20\u201330 nm in diameter seen from the TEM micrographs, and the grains assemble into agglomerates with size of hundreds nanometers, which is consistent with results of the particle size distribution of the Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 powder measured by laser diffraction and scattering method. Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 pellets sintered at 1300, 1400, 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C. It can be seen that all samples were single phase with cubic fluorite structure, there was no other speaks of the other phase. It suggests the fine powders synthesized by the sol\u2013gel method can be successfully sintered into electrolytes with single phase at 1300\u20131400 \u00b0C, whereas ceria-based electrolytes prepared by conventional ceramic techniques require around 1600 \u00b0C for sintering [20,21] . 3.2 Electrical characterization According to the reported before [22,23] and our former results [18] , it is possible to choose well-adapted equivalent electrical circuits to fit the impedance spectra of the electrolyte and obtain the different resistances R and capacitances C . Generally, three part contributions can be distinguished from each other with the aid of the equivalent circuit models fitting. In common ceramic electrolyte samples, these various contributions can be ascribed the various conduction processes occurring in the bulk (a high-frequency semicircle originates in bulk conduction and dielectric processes), grain boundaries (an intermediate-frequency semicircle provides information on the grain-boundary and/or impurity contribution to ionic conduction), and electrode/electrolyte interfaces (a low-frequency semicircle or arc is generally due to ion and electron transfers at the sample surface contacting the electrode) and are based on different resistances R and capacitances C (or constant phase elements, CPEs) in the equivalent parallel RC circuits. Fig. 2 shows that the impedance spectra and equivalent circuit model of Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 electrolyte sintered after 1400 \u00b0C measured at 400 \u00b0C. A small \u201ctail\u201d at high frequency, one semicircle and the onset of a second semicircle are observed. Except the inductance (\u223c10 \u22127 H) \u201ctail\u201d caused by cable, other part contributions can be distinguishes from each other with the aid of the equivalent circuits model. R 0 is bulk resistance ( R b ), R 1 is grain-boundary resistance ( R gb ), R 2 and R 3 are charge transfer resistances on electrode/electrolyte interface ( R ct ). The total resistance of electrolyte: (1) R t = R b + R gb therefore, the resistance data for each sample at different temperatures can be obtained and then converted to a conductivity datum \u03c3 , using the relation: (2) \u03c3 = 1 R L S where L is the sample thickness and S is the electrode area on the sample surface. In this way, the bulk conductivity, \u03c3 b , and the grain-boundary conductivity, \u03c3 gb and the total conductivity, \u03c3 t can be obtained. And the conductivity data were analyzed further using traditional Arrhenius equation: (3) \u03c3 = \u03c3 0 T exp \u2212 E \u03ba T where E is the activation energy of electrical conduction, \u03ba the Boltzman's constant, T the absolute temperature and \u03c3 0 is a pre-exponential factor being a constant in a certain temperature range. Figs. 3\u20135 show the Arrhenius plots of the electrical conductivity for the samples treated after different temperature at the temperature range from 300 to 850 \u00b0C. Tables 1\u20133 give electrical conductivity at different temperatures and activation energy values of certain temperature range. As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the total electrical conductivities of the samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C are almost sameness in whole temperature region; while there are apparent differences in electrical conductivity of the electrolytes sintered at 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C. As shown in Table 1 , the samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C appear higher \u03c3 t than at 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C in whole temperature region. In addition, the samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C give lower activation energies than the others at both temperature regions. It can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5 and Tables 2 and 3 that, to the samples sintered at different temperature, there are more apparent differences in grain-boundary conductivity than that in bulk conductivity. It means that sintering process mainly influenced the grain-boundary resistance. \u03c3 gb and \u03c3 b of the samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C are all higher than at 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C as the law of \u03c3 t , especially \u03c3 gb of the samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C (87 and 106 \u00d7 10 \u22122 S cm \u22121 ) are about five times as that of others measured at 600 \u00b0C. The activity energies of grain-boundary conduction all present higher values (1.00\u20131.19 eV) than those of the bulk (0.80\u20130.87 eV), above results indicated that the Ce 0.8 Sm 0.10 Y 0.10 O 1.9 electrolyte, when sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C, showed the better electrical property. Fig. 6 (a)\u2013(d) shows the micrographs of the broken pellet samples sintered at 1300, 1400, 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C. It can be seen that when sintered after 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C, the pellets were dense with a few small closed pores, the grain size is near 1 \u03bcm. However, when sintered after 1500 \u00b0C, both the number and the size of pores increased with grain size growing over 2 \u03bcm; when sintered after 1600 \u00b0C, the apparent changes were observed to be that the larger hole appeared and the grain size also grew up to about 5 \u03bcm. This phenomenon means that sintering temperature over 1500 \u00b0C was too high to cause over-sinter in such material system. During the over-sintering process, grain size grew rapidly to form coarse and big grains, at the same time, more and larger pores appeared. The density of the pellet was reduced; co-doped specimen may be separate to two phases when sintered over 1500 \u00b0C; and the asymmetry pores in 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C sintered specimens may be result to change the transportation performance. So the electrical property of the sample sintered at 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C was very weak compared with that of the samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C. It looks a lot of difference between 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C sintered specimens in the microstructure (grain size) but there is no difference between those grain-boundary conductivities shown in Fig. 5 , we think that may be the reason that when sintered after 1600 \u00b0C, grain boundary become thicker but total volume of grain boundary decreased, which may lead to increase in grain-boundary conductivity. To prevent over-sintering and obtain better electrical performance, the sintering temperature should be limited under 1400 \u00b0C. 4 Conclusions Nano-scale rare-earth co-doped Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 material was prepared by the sol\u2013gel method. When sintered after 1300, 1400, 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C, the samples all presented well single phase. The SEM results exhibited that when sintered after 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C, the pellets were denser with fewer pores than those sintered after 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C; and the sample was over-sintered after sintered at 1500 \u00b0C. The samples sintered at 1300 and 1400 \u00b0C showed much higher total conductivity and lower activation energy than those sintered at 1500 and 1600 \u00b0C. It demonstrated that rare-earth co-doped Ce 0.8 Sm 0.1 Y 0.1 O 1.9 material prepared by the sol\u2013gel method could be easy to sinter at lower temperature and obtain dense ceramic electrolyte with better electrical property.

A composite anode material, NYCx (60 wt% NiO+40 wt% (CCO)x(YSZ)1-x), for SOFCs (solid oxide fuel cells) was prepared. XRD results suggest that a solid solution reaction occurs between YSZ and CCO after sintering at 1400 \u00b0C for 10 h. From the impedance results, the conclusion can be drawn that the (CCO)0.25(YSZ) 0.75 solid solution is a mixed conductor (ionic and electronic). Its total conductivity is greater than that of YSZ. The NYCx (x>0) anodes exhibited better performance than the commonly used Ni+YSZ anode with regards to overpotential and anode interfacial impedance, with the NYC 0.25 anode exhibiting the best performance \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Research highlights \u25b6 As the emission of most luminescent materials does not have enough intensity, it is still a formidable challenge about how to improve the emission efficiency of these materials. It is known that doping of sensitizer ions or break of the crystal field symmetry can lead to the increase in emission intensity of rare-earth ions.

The emission intensity of Er 3+ is remarkably enhanced by the introduction of Bi 3+ under both two excitations. The emission enhancement under UV excitation originates from the energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ , while under IR excitation it can be attributed to the modification of the local crystal field around the Er 3+ . Keywords Luminescence Optical materials Optical properties Sol\u2013gel process 1 Introduction Over the past several decades, considerable works have been carried out on the rare earth ions doped luminescent materials regarding their applications in illumination, color displays, and biomedical imaging [1\u20133] . Among luminescent rare earth ions, Er 3+ is one of the most popular efficient ions, because its excited states ( 4 I 11/2 ) with long lifetimes can be easily populated by 980 nm irradiation [4,5] . As for the host for luminescent materials, most attention has been paid to oxide ceramics and nanopowders recently [6\u20138] . Y 2 O 3 is a promising oxide host material due to its high melting point, high chemical stability and low phonon energy. Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 has been established as one of the model systems for generating efficient upconversion radiation under 980 nm laser excitation [4,5] . As the emission of most luminescent materials does not have enough intensity, it is still a formidable challenge about how to improve the emission efficiency of these materials. It is known that doping of sensitizer ions or breaking of the crystal field symmetry can lead to the increase in the emission intensity of rare earth ions [9\u201311] . Bi 3+ possesses a broad absorption band centering around 330 nm, and a broad emission band raging from 300 to 700 nm [12\u201314] . The emission band of Bi 3+ overlaps with the 4 I 15/2 \u2192 4 F 7/2 and 4 I 15/2 \u2192 2 H 11/2 transitions of Er 3+ , so Bi 3+ can also be used as a sensitizer of Er 3+ for the radiative energy transfer process. The broad absorb band of Bi 3+ is beneficial to absorb more energy and enhance Er 3+ emission under UV excitation. Moreover, as the radius of Bi 3+ is larger than that of Y 3+ , substitution of Y 3+ with Bi 3+ can modify the symmetry of crystal field in Y 2 O 3 , which is in favor of the enhancement of emission intensity. In this study, Bi 3+ is selected as codopant to enhance the luminescent efficiency of Er 3+ . The emission intensity of Er 3+ is increased under both 330 nm and 980 nm excitations. The relevant mechanisms are discussed in detail. 2 Experimental Y 2 O 3 powders doped with different concentrations of Er 3+ and Bi 3+ were prepared by a sol\u2013gel combustion method. High purity Y 2 O 3 , Er 2 O 3 , Bi 2 O 3 and C 6 H 8 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O were used as starting materials. First, stoichiometric Y 2 O 3 , Er 2 O 3 and Bi 2 O 3 were dissolved in HNO 3 . Then C 6 H 8 O 7 \u00b7H 2 O was added to the mixed solution with the molar ratio of nitrate to citric acid to be 4:1. The resulting solution was heated at 80 \u00b0C in order to obtain a gel. Subsequently, the gel was rapidly heated to 200 \u00b0C and an autocombustion process took place. Finally, the precursor was calcined at 800 \u00b0C in air to obtain Er 3+ and Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 powders. The XRD patterns of the powders were recorded by a Rigaku D/max- \u03b3 B diffractrometer using Cu K \u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.15418 nm). The content of Bi 3+ was determined by EDS measurement, and the results show that the Bi 3+ is nearly in stoichiometric. The Stokes emission measurements were performed on Hitachi F-4500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer at room temperature. The upconversion emission spectra were measured by a power controllable 980 diode laser and detected with a lens-coupled monochromator with an attached photomultiplier. 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns of Y 2 O 3 doped with different concentrations of Er 3+ and Bi 3+ are shown in Fig. 1 . The XRD data confirm that all samples are single phase with cubic structure (JPDS No. 86-1107). The lattice parameters are listed in Table 1 . The results show that Bi 3+ and Er 3+ were successfully doped into Y 2 O 3 host, and with the increase in Bi 3+ content, the lattice parameter increases since the ion radius of Bi 3+ is larger than that of Y 3+ . It can also be found that the FWHM of the peaks in XRD patterns does not vary with the increase in Bi 3+ content, namely, Bi 3+ doping does not influence the crystallinity of Y 2 O 3 which could affect the emission of Er 3+ . Fig. 2 shows the emission spectra of 1.0 mol% Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 (Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 ), 1.0 mol% Bi 3+ :Y 2 O 3 (Bi 3+ :Y 2 O 3 ) and 1.0 mol% Bi 3+ codoped Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 . The strong emission band of Bi 3+ locates at wavelengths from 360 to 630 nm, while the emission peaks of Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 are very weak. However, the 1.0 mol% Bi 3+ activated Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 exhibits sharp peaks due to 2 H 11/2 / 4 S 3/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transitions of Er 3+ ions and its emission intensity is about 42 times larger than that of the sample without Bi 3+ . There are two main mechanisms for energy transfer between sensitizer and activator: (1) radiative transfer through emission of sensitizer and reabsorption by activator; (2) non-radiative transfer associated with resonance between absorber and emitter [13] . As shown in Fig. 3 , the strong excitation band from 300 to 360 nm is attributed to the 1 S 0 \u2192 3 P 1 transition of Bi 3+ while the excitation peaks at wavelength longer than 360 nm are ascribed to the 4 I 15/2 \u2192 4 F 7/2 and 4 I 15/2 \u2192 2 H 11/2 transitions of Er 3+ [15,16] . The emission band of Bi 3+ ranging from 360 to 630 nm significantly overlaps with the excitation spectrum of Er 3+ ranging from 360 to 540 nm. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this system Bi 3+ is a sensitizer for the luminescence of Er 3+ and Bi 3+ can transfer energy to Er 3+ through the radiative transfer process. The luminescent intensity of Er 3+ is remarkably enhanced by the incorporation of Bi 3+ under 330 nm light excitation, which suggested a very efficient energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ . Fig. 4 shows the emission spectra of Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 codoped with different amounts of Bi 3+ (excited at 330 nm). In Fig. 4 , the sharp emission peaks correspond to the 2 H 11/2 / 4 S 3/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 transitions of Er 3+ . The position of emission peaks dose not vary with the Bi 3+ concentration, but the luminescence intensity changes a lot. The inset displays the enhancement magnitude of the emission intensity of Er 3+ , ranging from 515 to 580 nm, as a function of Bi 3+ concentration. As shown in the inset, the intensity of Er 3+ considerably increases first, reaches a maximum at the 2.0 mol% Bi 3+ , and falls thereafter. The decrease in the emission intensity is caused by the concentration quenching of Bi 3+ . The total energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the probability of energy transfer from sensitizer to activator, but also on that between the sensitizers [15,17] . The energy transfer efficiency increases with the decrease of the distance between the sensitizer and activator (or sensitizer). In this study, Bi 3+ is the sensitizer and Er 3+ is the activator. In the case of the Bi 3+ content less than 2 mol%, the distance between Bi 3+ and Er 3+ decreases with Bi 3+ doping, and thus the energy transfer efficiency from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ increases. However, when the concentration of Bi 3+ exceeds 2.0 mol%, the average distance between two Bi 3+ becomes short. This leads to the efficient energy transfer between Bi 3+ , and the non-radiative process increases gradually, which hinders the energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ . In a word, adding an optimal amount of Bi 3+ to Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 can enhance the emission intensity of Er 3+ through energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ , but after exceeding the optimum concentration, the energy transfer between Bi 3+ becomes more efficient which thus results in less energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ . As discussed above, an appropriate amount of Bi 3+ doping can enhance emission intensity of Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 through the radiative transfer process under UV excitation. In addition to UV excitation, the emission intensity of Er 3+ :Y 2 O 3 under IR excitation can also be increased by Bi 3+ doping. Fig. 5 a displays the upconversion luminescence spectra of the Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 under 980 nm excitation. The inset shows the integral intensity of green and red emissions as a function of Bi 3+ content. As shown in the inset, both the green and red emissions increase as the Bi 3+ content is below 1.5 mol%, however, above that concentration the emission intensity becomes weak. In order to clarify the mechanism of the change in green and red emissions depending on Bi 3+ content, we measure the violet and blue emissions of Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 under excitation at 980 nm as well as the power dependence of violet, blue, green and red emissions. It is known that this dependence is expressed as I \u221d nP , where I is the intensity of emission, P is the laser pump power, and n is the number of phonons needed to produce the emission [18] . Fig. 5 b shows the violet and blue spectra of Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 under excitation at 980 nm. We cannot observe the emission band of Bi 3+ in the upconversion spectra ranging from 350 to 480 nm. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6 , the values of slopes for the violet, blue, green and red emissions are 2.98, 2.77, 1.99 and 1.71, respectively. It indicates that both the violet and blue emissions are 3 phonon processes, and both the green and red emissions are 2 phonon processes. Consequently, the upconversion processes of Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 could be described as Fig. 7 . The Er 3+ can be promoted to the 4 I 11/2 state through ground state absorption (GSA) process, and then nonradiative relaxation occurs and populates the 4 I 13/2 state. Subsequently, 4 I 11/2 and 4 I 13/2 state are further excited to the 4 F 7/2 and 4 F 9/2 state respectively via excited state absorption (ESA1 and ESA2) or energy transfer upconversion (ETU) processes. After that nonradiative relaxation processes populate the 2 H 11/2 / 4 S 3/2 and 4 F 9/2 states, so the green and red emissions are observed by the transitions of 2 H 11/2 / 4 S 3/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 and 4 F 9/2 \u2192 4 I 15/2 . The Er 3+ ions in the 4 S 3/2 state are excited to 2 G 7/2 state by absorbing a third phonon (ESA3), and then nonradiatively relax to 4 G 11/2 , 2 H 9/2 states. From these two states violet and blue emissions are emitted. As mentioned above, the doping of Bi 3+ does not change the emission process of Er 3+ , that is to say, there is not energy transfer between Bi 3+ and Er 3+ under 980 nm excitation. Moreover, high crystallinity could lessen nonradiative relaxation probability and then enhance the emission intensity of Er 3+ . Nevertheless, from the XRD patterns we can conclude that Bi 3+ doping does not influence the crystallinity of Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 . Therefore, the enhanced emission of Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 originates from neither the energy transfer nor the crystallinity. It is well known that the intra-4 f electronic transitions of rare earth are parity forbidden according to the quantum mechanical selection rules. However, the forbiddance can be partially broken when the rare earth situates at low symmetry sites [10,19] . The radius of Bi 3+ (1.03 \u00c5) is larger than that of Y 3+ (0.90 \u00c5) [20] , so the substitution of Bi 3+ for Y 3+ can modify the symmetry of the crystal field in the lattice and enhance the radiative transition rate favoring the enhancement of upconversion emission intensity. The sensitization of upconversion emission of Er 3+ on Bi 3+ doping suggests that the Bi 3+ could effectively modify the crystal field around Er 3+ and the modification of crystal field depends strongly on the Bi 3+ doping content. The optimal doping content of Bi 3+ is found to be 1.5 mol%, and the corresponding emission intensity is 1.5 times larger than that without Bi 3+ doping. When the Bi 3+ content exceeds 1.5 mol%, the upconversion emission becomes weak due to the concentration quenching. For higher content of Bi 3+ , B i n 3 + aggregates may be formed [21] , which act as trapping centers and dissipate the absorbed energy nonradiatively instead of transferring it to the Er 3+ activator. 4 Conclusions The enhancement of the emission in Er 3+ /Bi 3+ codoped Y 2 O 3 under 330 nm and 980 nm results from two different mechanisms. The remarkably enhanced luminescent intensity under UV excitation originates from the efficient energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er 3+ , whereas the enhancement in the upconversion emissions under IR excitation is attributed to the modification of the local crystal field around the Er 3+ . The significant enhancement of emission intensity under both UV and IR excitations suggests that Er 3+ /Bi 3+ :Y 2 O 3 could be a promising candidate in the application of optoelectronic devices.

        "abstract": "Perovskite oxides LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 ( x = 0.2, 1/3) were synthesized using high-pressure and high-temperature method. This new synthesis route has some advantages. XRD analysis showed that the x = 0.2 sample belongs to cubic perovskite-type structure and the x = 1/3 sample belongs to orthorhombic perovskite-type structure. EPR measurement indicated that Ti ions were in mixed valence of +3 and +4. IR measurement indicated that the vibration frequency and width of BO 6 octahedron stretching vibration absorption band decreases with the increasing of x . Valence of Ti ions can be altered by high-pressure and high-temperature. Keywords High-pressure and high-temperature synthesis LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 EPR Mixed valence 1 Introduction Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the perovskite-related copper oxide and colossal magnatoresistance (CMR) effect in the perovskite manganites, there has been renewed growing interest in mixed valence perovskite compounds, on which pressure can also play an important role [1\u20133] . Owing to many interesting properties such as rich structural characteristics, transport and magnetic properties [4\u20137] , perovskite oxides of R(III)Ti(III)O 3 (R = rare earth) and R(III) 1\u2212 x M x TiO 3 (R = La, Nd, Gd, Er and Y; M = Ba 2+ , Sr 2+ , Ca 2+ , K + and Na + , while Ti ions were in mixed valence of +3 and +4) have been one of the hot subjects of recent studies. In Refs. [8\u201311] , it has been found that in the Li\u2013Ti\u2013La mixed oxide catalysts LaTi 1\u2212 y Li y O 3 was the major active phase for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), however, single phase was not obtained and the structure and the value of y were not determined. Methane is the major component of natural gas, which is an inexpensive and accessible energy source. The OCM has been recognized as one of the most promising industrial processes for directly converting methane to ethylene and higher hydrocarbons. So it is very useful for basic and applied research to synthesize single phase of perovskite oxides LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 and characterize their structure, chemical compositions, valence state and so on. In previous studies, because Ti 4+ ions are considerably stable at ambient condition, the synthesis of compounds R 1\u2212 x M x TiO 3 (R = La, Nd and Y; M = Ba 2+ , Sr 2+ , Ca 2+ , K + and Na + ) in which Ti ions are in mixed valence of +3 and+4 required a reducing H 2 atmosphere when using TiO 2 as starting materials or an inert Ar atmosphere when using Ti, TiO, Ti 2 O 3 and TiO 2 . However, we know that the valence state of cations can be reduced by high-pressure and high-temperature [12\u201314] . Therefore, in this paper, we use a new synthesis route. By using high-pressure and high-temperature method, perovskite oxides of LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 were synthesized using TiO 2 with Ti 4+ state as starting materials. The structure and mixed valence characteristics of the samples were investigated. 2 Experimental The samples were prepared by mixing TiO 2 (99.9%), La 2 O 3 (99.99%) and LiNO 3 (AR) according to the nominal ratio of LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 . TiO 2 and La 2 O 3 were heated at 900 \u00b0C, respectively, for 5 h before the experiments to remove volatile impurities. The mixtures were homogeneously ground, prepressured into tablets and put into high-pressure chamber [13] . High-pressure and high-temperature synthesis was carried out using a belt-type high-pressure apparatus. The pressure generated inside the cell was calibrated by the electrical resistance change on the basis of phase transformation of Bi, Tl and Ba (2.55, 2.69 and 7.7 GPa). The sample was heated electrically through a graphite heater, and the temperature was measured by inserting a Pt30%Rh\u2013Pt6%Rh thermocouple in the cell. The high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis procedure is to increase the pressure to 3.3 GPa, then increase the temperature to 1030 \u00b0C. After being kept under high-pressure and high-temperature for 30 min, the samples were quenched to room temperature under high-pressure, and finally the pressure was released. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku 12 kW D/max-rA copper rotating anode X-ray diffractometer with nickel filter and graphite monochromator. The XRD data for index and cell-parameter calculations were collected by a scanning mode with a step interval of 0.02\u00b0 and a preset time of 4 s per step with silicon used as an internal standard. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) for the powder samples were measured at room temperature on a BRUKER ER200D EPR spectrometer with 9.77 GHz microwave frequency, 6.5 mW microwave power, 100 kHz modulator frequency, 0.32 mT field modulation intensity, 0.348 T middle range and 0.6 T scan range. During the EPR measurements, their amount (10 \u22123 mol) and measurement conditions except the gains were kept constant for all samples. IR spectra were measured at room temperature on a Nicolet 5DX Model FT spectrometer using the KBr pellet technique. The chemical compositions were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) equipped with a Perkin-Elmer Plasma 40 emission spectrometer. 3 Results and discussion Table 1 lists the preparation conditions for LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 . In the synthesis, the pressure, temperature and time were found to be sensitive to the purity of the products. Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples. The x = 0.2 sample can be indexed in cubic perovskite-type system ( Table 2 ). The cell parameters are a = 0.7867 nm, V = 0.4870 nm 3 ( V 0 = V /8 = 0.06086 nm 3 ). The x = 1/3 sample can be indexed in orthorhombic perovskite-type system ( Table 3 ). The cell parameters are a = 0.5572 nm, b = 0.5566 nm, c = 0.7867 nm, V = 0.2440 nm 3 ( V 0 = V /4 = 0.06100 nm 3 ). Thus, as the value of x increases, there is a structure transition. The increase of V 0 with the increasing of x suggests that the effect of substitution of Ti by Li (0.076 nm) is predominant over that of Ti(III) (0.067 nm) by Ti(IV) (0.0605 nm). The powder X-ray diffraction patterns show that the products are free of impurities. The chemical compositions determined by ICP for LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 are in good agreement with the formulas. In order to investigate the valence of Ti ions, the EPR of samples was detected. The electronic configuration of Ti 4+ and Ti 3+ ions in ground state are 3d 0 and 3d 1 , respectively. At room temperature, there is no EPR signal for Ti 4+ ions, while EPR signal for Ti 3+ ions can be observed. The EPR spectra of the samples detected at room temperature, in the range of 0.048\u20130.648 T, are shown in Fig. 2 . One g = 1.97 signal and a set of hyperfine interaction splitting spectra due to the isotopes 47 Ti ( I = 5/2, natural abundance 7.75%) and 49 Ti ( I = 7/2, natural abundance 5.51%) at room temperature are observed. For x = 0.2 sample, the intensity of hyperfine interaction splitting spectra is much weaker than that of the g = 1.97 signal and does not appear obviously. These signals are related with Ti 3+ ions. The existence of Ti 3+ ions shows that high-pressure and high-temperature can alter the valence of Ti 4+ ions. The relative signal intensity of g = 1.97 for x = 0.2 sample is much stronger than that for x = 1/3 sample, indicating that the percentage of Ti 3+ ions in x = 0.2 sample is much higher than for x = 1/3 sample. According to the formula of LaTi 0.8 Li 0.2 O 3 , the percentage of Ti 3+ ions is 50% at the most, so only a very small percentage of Ti 3+ ions exist in x = 1/3 sample. Fig. 3 shows infrared (IR) spectra of the samples at room temperature. In the range of 400\u20131000 cm \u22121 , the IR spectra have two broad absorption bands. The two absorption bands are located at 400\u2013500 and 500\u2013750 cm \u22121 , which are attributed to BO 6 octahedron bending and stretching vibration, respectively. The vibration frequency and width of BO 6 octahedron stretching vibration absorption band decreases with the increasing of x . The high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis method has some advantages: (1) With the airtight effect, high-pressure and high-temperature can provide a reducing condition which is equivalent to the use of reducing and inert gas. This caused the reduction of Ti 4+ to Ti 3+ ions. (2) High-pressure can make the starting materials dense, increase the cross-section of reaction, accelerate the diffusion between the reaction materials powders, so accelerate the reaction rate and shorten synthesis time. (3) Perovskite oxide of LaTi 0.8 Li 0.2 O 3 can be synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature, however, cannot be synthesized by the solid state reaction method in air at temperature less than 1300 \u00b0C (we did not investigate at higher temperature). 4 Conclusions In summary, mixed valence perovskite oxides LaTi 1\u2212 x Li x O 3 were synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature. The x = 0.2 and x = 1/3 samples can be indexed in pseudo-cubic and orthorhombic system, respectively. As the value of x increases, there is a structure transition. In the synthesis, the pressure, temperature and time were found to be sensitive to the purity of the products. Ti ions are in mixed valence of +3 and +4. High-pressure and high-temperature can alter the valence state of Ti 4+ ions and no reducing agent is needed during the process of synthesis. So high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis method is very effective in synthesizing mixed valence perovskites containing Ti 3+ ions. It is expected that the mixed valence of Ti 3+ and Ti 4+ , the substitution by Li + ions in B-site and the effect of high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis can cause some new interesting properties which are to be studied.

        "abstract": "Screen-printing technology was developed to fabricate gas-tight yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte films on porous NiO\u2013YSZ anode substrates for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Several key process parameters such as the starting YSZ powder, printing ink composition, printing time and sintering temperature were studied and reported in detail. SEM results revealed that the selected process parameters exerted obvious influences on the microstructure of the screen-printed YSZ films. Open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were used to evaluate the usage feasibility of screen-printed YSZ films in SOFCs. Cell performance test results showed that the above-mentioned parameters had crucial effects on the OCVs and power density of the prepared cells. Based on appropriate parameters, an OCV value of 1.081 V and a power density of 0.96 Wcm \u22122 were obtained at 800 \u00b0C using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. Keywords Solid oxide fuel cells Screen-printing Electrolyte films Process parameter Yttria-stabilized zirconia 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are considered a promising energy conversion device because of high efficiency, low pollution and fuel flexibility [1,2] . For the viewpoint of cost reduction and long-term stability, it is necessary to reduce the operating temperature. Operation of SOFCs at intermediate-temperatures (600\u2013800 \u00b0C) has many advantages including lower degradation rate of cell components, wider material choice and cost reduction. Towards this end, reduction of the thickness of electrolyte is desirable. Up to now, significant developments have been made to make thin film electrolytes. There are a number of approaches for thin film fabrication, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [3] , DC magnetron sputtering [4] , tape casting [5] , sol\u2013gel dip-drawing [6] , spray coating [7,8] , plaster casting [9] and so on. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, CVD is an effective way to make a gas-tight and uniform thin electrolyte film below 5 \u03bcm, however, it has some drawbacks of high cost, relatively low deposition rates, and the presence of corrosive gases. Spray coating has high deposition rates, but it is difficult to obtain a thin dense electrolyte film. Very thin dense films can be fabricated by the sol\u2013gel technique, but many coatings are necessary to get a fully dense film, and this is very time consuming. To reduce the cost of fabrication, a screen-printing technique [10] was developed to fabricate gas-tight yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte films for anode-supported SOFCs. In this technique, YSZ powder was firstly mixed with appropriate organic vehicles to make homogeneous and stable printing inks. Then the ink was extruded through a screen onto the anode substrate by a scraping blade. Finally, the anode substrate with printed electrolyte film was dried and co-fired at high temperature to densify the YSZ film. Compared with the film deposition techniques mentioned above, the screen-printing technique is cost-effective and simple. This technique has been extensively adopted to fabricate photoconductor films [11] , BaCeO 3 -based films [12] and ferroelectric films [13] . For fabrication of SOFCs, the technique has been used to make electrolyte films using powders of samaria-doped ceria (SDC) [14] , yttria-doped ceria (YDC) [15] . Recently, Dollen and Barnett [16] prepared anode-supported YSZ film SOFCs by screen-printing technology and got a maximum power density of 1.45 Wcm \u22122 at 800 \u00b0C. In our previous report [17] , the effect of the starting powder on screen-printed YSZ films was investigated. However, to the best of this author's knowledge, there are few publications on a screen-printed dense YSZ electrolyte film for SOFCs. The report related to the influences of the process parameters on microstructure and performance of screen-printed YSZ electrolyte films was also insufficient. In this paper, screen-printing technology was developed to fabricate YSZ electrolyte films onto NiO\u2013YSZ porous anode substrates. Several important process parameters including starting YSZ powder, printing ink composition, number of printing layers and sintering temperature were studied and reported in detail. 2 Experimental 2.1 Starting YSZ powder preparation YSZ powder bought from Tosoh corporation (TZ-8Y, Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to prepare the printing ink. The YSZ powder was divided into two batches: the first batch was the original powder without any treatment and named YSZ-0; the second batch was ball-milled with ethanol media for different time using an agate jar (70 cm 3 ) and zirconia ball (1 cm in diameter). A rotation speed of 200 rpm was used during ball milling. The powder, which was ball-milled for 13 h, is named YSZ-13. Similarly, the same powders which were ball-milled for 24 h and 36 h are called YSZ-24 and YSZ-36, respectively. 2.2 Printing ink preparation The printing ink contains two constituents: YSZ particles and a temporary organic vehicle. The former is the main constituent of the ink and the latter controls the rheological properties of the printing ink. The organic vehicle prepared by ourselves is a terpineol\u2013ethylcellulose mixture which was obtained by dissolving 6 wt.% ethylcellulose (analytical reagent, A.R., Dongfeng Chemical Reagents Plant, Wenzhou, China) into 94 wt.% terpineol (A.R., Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagents Development Centre, Tianjin, China). To investigate the effect of the starting powder on the screen-printed YSZ films, the as-prepared YSZ powder of YSZ-0, YSZ-13, YSZ-24 and YSZ-36 was mixed with the organic vehicle in an agate mortar in a weight ratio of 4:5, respectively, and ground for 2 h to get a homogeneous and stable printing ink. To study the effect of ink composition on the screen-printed YSZ films, the YSZ-13 powder was mixed with the organic vehicle in different weight ratios. The YSZ content in printing ink was varied from 17 to 45 wt.% in this study. The viscosity of as-prepared YSZ ink was tested with a NDJ-99 rotation viscometer (Chengdu instrument plant, Chengdu, China) at room temperature. The shear rate was varied from 1.5 to 60 rpm according to the instrument range and the ink viscosity. 2.3 Preparation of YSZ films and cells NiO\u2013YSZ anode substrates were prepared by a conventional ceramic process. The NiO and YSZ powders were mixed in a weight ratio of 1:1. To form sufficient porosity, 10 wt.% starch was added as a pore former. The mixed powders were pressed into pellets of 13 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The green pellets were pre-sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h to improve the mechanical properties. The sintered pellets were used as the supports of the cells. The mean porosity of the NiO\u2013YSZ anode was about 59% as tested by a standard Archimedes method. The as-prepared YSZ printing ink was screen printed through a terylene screen onto the NiO\u2013YSZ anode substrates by a rubber squeegee. The mesh count of the screen is 165 wires cm \u22121 and the wire diameter is 30 \u03bcm. The screen has an opening size of 30 \u03bcm and an open area of 25%. The angle between the rubber squeegee and the screen was kept at 65\u201385\u00b0and the distance between the screen and the top surface of the anode substrates was 2\u20135 mm. The printing rate was about 5 cm s \u22121 . Different printing times were used to study the effect on the thickness of films and OCVs of the cells. After drying in air, the anode/film bilayers were sintered at 1200, 1250, 1300, 1350 or 1400 \u00b0C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min \u22121 in air to densify the YSZ films. La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSM)\u2013YSZ composite cathode layer was deposited onto the sintered YSZ film also by screen-printing technology. The cathode powder was composed of 60 wt.% LSM and 40 wt.% YSZ. The powder was mixed thoroughly with the ethylcellulose\u2013terpineol vehicle to get cathode printing ink. After screen printing, the cathode was sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for 2 h in air. The cathode effective area was 0.25 cm 2 . 2.4 Films microstructure and cells testing Microstructure of the screen-printed YSZ films was examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-570, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cells were tested from 650 to 850 \u00b0C. Hydrogen was supplied to the anode side and the cathode side was exposed to ambient air. Hydrogen flow rate is 110 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm). Cells performance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were measured using SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer in combination with SI 1287 electrochemical interface (Solartron Instruments, Hampshire, UK). Current\u2013voltage ( I \u2013 V ) curves were tested by linear sweep voltammetry at a scanning rate of 5 mV s \u22121 . The impedance data were collected in the frequency range of 910 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a excitation amplitude of 10 mV under open-circuit conditions. Gas tightness of the YSZ electrolyte films was evaluated by comparing open-circuit voltages (OCVs) of the cells with the OCVs predicted by the Nernst equation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 On the effect of the starting YSZ powder 3.1.1 Morphology of the starting YSZ powder Fig. 1 shows the morphology of the starting YSZ powder. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the original Tosoh YSZ powder without ball-milling consisted of spherical aggregates with a diameter of 20\u201360 \u03bcm. After ball-milling for 13 h, as can be seen from Fig. 1 (b), the YSZ particles exhibited a spheroidal shape with a particle size of 0.2\u20130.6 \u03bcm. It was clear that ball-milling considerably enhanced the uniformity of the YSZ powder by partly breaking the aggregates as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Fig. 1 (c) shows the morphology of the YSZ-36 powder. The powder was composed of spherical granules with an average particle size of 0.2 \u03bcm. After ball milling for about 36 h, the aggregates in the original YSZ powder were thoroughly broken and the powder showed a very good uniformity. 3.1.2 Microstructure of the YSZ films Fig. 2 shows cross-sectional view of cells with screen-printed YSZ films prepared from different YSZ powders. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (a), the YSZ film prepared with the YSZ-0 powder and without ball-milling was very porous in cross-section. These open pores will lower the OCV of the cell because of the gas leakage through the electrolyte films. On the other hand, Fig. 2 (b\u2013d) shows that the compactness of the YSZ film can be significantly improved by using the ball-milled YSZ powder. It is clear that the compactness of screen-printed YSZ films were obviously influenced by the properties of starting YSZ powder. As shown in Fig. 1 , the ball-milling can break the aggregates and enhance the uniformity of the powder. The YSZ powder with a good uniformity helps to obtain a homogeneous printing ink, which helps to enhance the pack density of the screen-printing films [17] . 3.1.3 Open-circuit voltages (OCVs) Fig. 3 shows the effect of ball-milling time on OCVs of the cells with screen-printed YSZ electrolyte films. The OCVs plotted in Fig. 3 were obtained from the cells shown in Fig. 2 . The cell shown in Fig. 2 (a) provides a low OCV of 0.815 V at 800 \u00b0C. This OCV is obviously lower than a calculated Nernst value of 1.10 V. The cells shown in Fig. 2 (b\u2013d) can obtain a OCV of about 1.08 V, which implies gas leakage across YSZ films is insignificant. 3.2 On the effect of the printing ink composition 3.2.1 Viscosity of the ink The effect of YSZ content on the viscosity of the printing ink was tested and the results were plotted in Fig. 4 . All of the viscosity data were collected at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). The terpineol\u2013ethylcellulose organic vehicle has a viscosity of 7.9 Pa s. The viscosity increases with increasing YSZ content as shown in Fig. 4 . 3.2.2 Microstructure of YSZ films The viscosity and rheology of the printing ink are very important for screen-printing technology. The viscosity of ink can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the YSZ powder to the organic vehicle. If the YSZ content in the ink is too low, a porous film is observed because of the volatilization of the organic vehicle during sintering of the film. If the YSZ content is too high, on the other hand, cracks and incomplete ink coverage occur because of the poor rheology of the ink [16,18] . Fig. 5 shows the effect of ink composition on the microstructure of screen-printed YSZ films. The YSZ film shown in Fig. 5 (a) was prepared from the ink with an optimized YSZ content of 40 wt.%. There are no cracks in the surface of the sintered YSZ film. Fig. 5 (b) shows a film prepared from an ink comprising 70 wt.% of YSZ. Many large cracks can be seen in surface of the film. Furthermore, rectangular traces made by screen can be clearly seen, implying that the printing ink has a poor rheology during screen printing. A typical YSZ content in ink for successful printing is 30\u201345 wt.% in this study. 3.3 On effect of the printing times 3.3.1 Microstructure of the YSZ films Fig. 6 shows the microstructure of cells with different layers of screen-printed YSZ films from one to seven layers. It can be seen that the thickness of the YSZ films increases with increasing printing times. The thinnest YSZ film prepared by screen-printing is about 2 \u03bcm in this study as shown in Fig. 6 (a). 3.3.2 Open-circuit voltages (OCVs) The experimental OCVs obtained from the YSZ films with different printing times are plotted in Fig. 7 . The theoretical OCVs derived from the Nernst equation are also plotted for comparison. The single and three-layer printing YSZ films provide OCVs of lower than 1.0 V from 650 to 850 \u00b0C. When the printing times increases to five or above, OCVs of higher than 1.0 V were obtained. Near theoretical OCVs were observed from the 10-layer printing of the YSZ film. The OCVs results of Fig. 7 suggest that, based on our experimental condition, at least five-layers of printing is necessary to get high OCVs for successful operation of SOFCs. 3.4 On the sintering temperature of the YSZ films 3.4.1 Microstructure of the YSZ films Figs. 8 and 9 show the cross-sectional and surface microstructural features of the screen-printed YSZ films sintered at different temperatures. The densification of the screen-printed YSZ films was enhanced by elevation of the sintering temperatures. The YSZ films sintered at 1200 and 1250 \u00b0C show an obviously incomplete sintering as can be seen from Fig. 8 (a and b). The films sintered at 1400 \u00b0C show a complete sintering with limited blind pinholes in cross-section and no cracks in surface. Although the films sintered at 1300 and 1350 \u00b0C show somewhat incomplete sintering, OCVs of higher than 1.0 V can be obtained from these films (see Fig. 10 ). 3.4.2 Open-circuit voltages (OCVs) Fig. 10 shows the effect of the sintering temperature on OCVs of the cells with screen-printed YSZ films. The YSZ films sintered at 1200, 1250, 1300, 1350 and 1400 \u00b0C provide OCVs of 0.6, 0.67, 1.051, 1.081 and 1.083 V, respectively. To obtain OCVs of higher than 1.0 V, the lowest sintering temperature for screen-printed YSZ films were about 1300 \u00b0C from this study. 3.5 Performance of the prepared cells Fig. 11 shows a typical cell performance in our study. The maximum power densities at 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C are 0.22, 0.43, 0.67, 0.96 and 1.36 W cm \u22122 , respectively, using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The cell provides good performance at intermediate temperature. The 15-\u03bcm thick YSZ electrolyte film for the cell was sintered at 1300 \u00b0C for 4 h. A sintering temperature of 1300 \u00b0C is lower than the typical sintering temperature (1400 \u00b0C) for densification of zirconia-based electrolyte films, showing a potential advantage of energy conservation. Fig. 12 shows the electrode polarization resistance and the electrolyte resistance for the cell shown in Fig. 11 . The insert is a typical impedance of the cell tested at 800 \u00b0C. The electrode polarization resistance occupies about 82\u201387% of the total cell resistance from 650 to 850 \u00b0C while this ratio for the YSZ electrolyte film resistance is only about 18\u201313%. This result reveals that, based on the optimized electrode material, electrode microstructure and electrode/electrolyte interface, better performances can be obtained by screen-printing technology. 4 Conclusions Four important process parameters including the starting YSZ powder, printing ink composition, printing times and sintering temperature were investigated in detail and the following conclusions can be drawn: (a) the starting YSZ powder exerts a crucial influence on the microstructure of the screen-printed YSZ electrolyte films. The films prepared from the YSZ powder with high aggregates are very porous while the films made from the YSZ powder having a good uniformity are dense and gas-tight; (b) to obtain crack-free YSZ films, the printing ink composition should be optimized. An ink composed of too high a ratio of YSZ solids results in cracks because of the poor rheology of the ink. A typical YSZ content in ink for successful printing was 30\u201345 wt.%; (c) after a single printing, the thinnest YSZ films of 2-\u03bcm thick can be obtained by screen-printing. At least a five-layer printing is necessary to get OCVs of higher than 1.0 V for successful operation of SOFCs; (d) the densification of the screen-printed YSZ films can be enhanced by elevation of the sintering temperatures. OCVs of 1.051 V at 800 \u00b0C were observed based on screen-printed YSZ films sintered at 1300 \u00b0C for 4 h. A sintering temperature of 1300 \u00b0C is lower than the typical sintering temperature (about 1400 \u00b0C) for densification of zirconia-based electrolyte films. A typical cell based on a 15-\u03bcm thick YSZ film sintered at 1300 \u00b0C provided the maximum power densities of 0.22, 0.43, 0.67, 0.96 and 1.36 W cm \u22122 at 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively, using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The performance of the cell prepared by screen-printing is basically limited by the resistance of the electrode polarization. Improvement of the electrode activity is necessary to further improve the performance of SOFCs fabricated by screen-printing technology.

Our results confirm that the exchange bias should originate from the coupling between the ferromagnetic La2 NiMnO6 and antiferromagnetic antiphase boundaries. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "A thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (8 mol% YSZ) film was successfully fabricated on a NiO-YSZ anode substrate by a screen-printing technique. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) results suggested that the YSZ film thickness was about 31 \u03bcm after sintering at 1400 \u00b0C for 4 h in air. A 60 wt% La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 + 40 wt% YSZ was screen-printed onto the YSZ film surface as cathode. A single cell was tested from 650 to 850 \u00b0C using hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, which showed an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.02 V and a maximum power density of 1.30 W cm \u22122 at 850 \u00b0C. The OCV was higher than 1.0 V, which suggested that the YSZ film was quite dense and that the fuel gas leakage through the YSZ film was negligible. Screen-printing can be a promising method for manufacturing YSZ films for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Keywords Solid oxide fuel cells Screen-printing YSZ films 1 Introduction In recent years, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have attracted more and more attention, due to their advantages of: high energy conversion efficiency, low pollution, fuel flexibility, etc. [1\u20135] . Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been widely used as the electrolyte for SOFCs because of its unique combination of properties such as high chemical and thermal stability, and pure ionic conductivity over a wide range of conditions [8] . Conventional YSZ-supported SOFCs are usually operated at about 1000 \u00b0C. However, such a high operating temperature has led to many problems, such as electrode sintering, interfacial diffusion between electrolyte and electrodes and mechanical stress due to different thermal expansion coefficients [6,7] . If the YSZ thickness can be reduced, the SOFC operating temperature can be lowered and the above problems may be solved. So at present many researchers have focused their study on how to make thin YSZ films. There have been several successful methods reported to fabricate thin YSZ films, including electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD) [9] , chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [10] , sol\u2013gel processing [11] , spray pyrolysis [12] , and so on. Compared with these methods, screen-printing is a cost-effective route, being easy to use and suitable for mass production [8] . Many research groups have prepared their SOFC electrodes by screen-printing [15\u201322] , and this technique has been successfully adopted to fabricate SDC (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 ) and YDC (Ce 0.8 Y 0.2 O 1.9 ) membranes [13,14] . However, to our knowledge, there are few papers which report SOFC performance with a YSZ film fabricated by screen-printing. In this paper, we developed a screen-printing method to fabricate YSZ films on NiO-YSZ substrates and the cell performance has been investigated. 2 Experimental YSZ powder bought from Tosoh Corporation, NiO powder and flour were mixed thoroughly in a weight ratio of 5:5:1. The flour was used as a pore former. The mixed powder was then pressed into pellets (13 mm in diameter, 0.5 mm in thickness) under a pressure of 350 MPa. Then the pellets were sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h. To prepare YSZ films, YSZ powder was ball-milled for 13 h with ethanol added. A mixture of ethyl cellulose and terpineol was used as an organic vehicle. The ball-milled YSZ powder (60 wt%) was mixed with the organic vehicle (40 wt%) in an agate mortar and ground to obtain a homogeneous printing ink. The ink was then screen-printed onto the NiO-YSZ substrate to get a YSZ green film, and then the anode-supported green film was sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 4 h with a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C min \u22121 . La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSM) powder was mixed with YSZ powder in a ratio of 50/50 wt%. The LSM/YSZ powder was mixed with an organic vehicle to form a paste. The paste was screen-printed onto the sintered YSZ film and then sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for 2 h. The single cell was tested from 650 to 850 \u00b0C with hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant, respectively. Solartron SI 1287 and Solartron SI 1260 were employed to measure the cell performance. The microstructure of the post-test cell was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Microstructure of post-test cell Fig. 1 (a) shows the surface of the supported YSZ film and Fig. 1 (b) shows the cross-sectional view of the cell. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the irregular YSZ particles are arranged tightly with an average particle size of about 2.5 \u03bcm. From Fig. 1 (b), it can be seen that the YSZ film was crack-free, continuous and quite dense with a thickness of about 31 \u03bcm. There was no obvious cracking or delamination of the YSZ film. Both the anode and the cathode well adhered to the YSZ film. 3.2 Cell performance Fig. 2 shows the cell performance from 650 to 850 \u00b0C. Hydrogen and ambient air was used as fuel and oxidant, respectively. The open circuit voltages (OCVs) changed in a region of 1.02\u20131.08 V which were all higher than 1.0 V in the testing temperature range. Such high OCV values suggested that the YSZ electrolyte film was quite dense. The maximum power densities were 0.158, 0.318, 0.584, 0.964 and 1.30 W cm \u22122 at 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. In the I \u2013 V curves, some positive curvatures and negative ones were observed which usually corresponded to electrode polarization and concentration polarization, respectively [5] . From 650 to 750 \u00b0C, the cell exhibited obvious electrode polarization, which badly affected the cell performance. The concentration polarization was observed at 850 \u00b0C when the current density was higher than 4 A cm \u22122 . 4 Conclusions Dense YSZ electrolyte films were successfully prepared on porous NiO-YSZ substrates by a screen-printing technique. The crack-free and dense YSZ films adhered to the electrodes well. The anode-supported cell based on a 31-\u03bcm-thick YSZ electrolyte film exhibited maximum power densities of 0.158, 0.318, 0.584, 0.964 and 1.30 W cm \u22122 at 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Our initial results suggested that screen-printing is a promising technique for YSZ electrolyte film fabrication. More detailed investigations on screen-printing will be done in our future studies.

        "abstract": "The particle size distribution and the specific surface area of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powders could be changed by pre-calcining. Accordingly, the performances of Ni\u2013YSZ cermet might be changed too. In this paper, the effects of pre-calcined YSZ powders on Ni\u2013YSZ cermet were investigated. The performances of Ni\u2013YSZ cermet, including the basic physical characterization, sintering shrinkage and electrochemical properties, were studied in connection with the quality of YSZ powders pre-calcined at 900 \u00b0C, 1100 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C, respectively. The results indicated that the crystal structure was not changed, but the porosity of open holes in NiO\u2013YSZ pellets was increased with the pre-calcining temperature increasing. In addition, the total shrinkage of different anode materials was changed by using different YSZ powders, the value of Ni\u2013YSZ cermet doping with YSZ pre-calcined at 900 \u00b0C and 1100 \u00b0C was closer to that of YSZ electrolyte. The cermet with YSZ powders pre-calcined at 900 \u00b0C showed the highest electric conductivity, and its polarization performance was closed to that of cermet with raw YSZ powders. Keywords Solid oxide fuel cell Ni\u2013YSZ cermet Pre-calcine YSZ 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an environmentally friendly energy conversion device that converts the energy of a chemical reaction directly into electrical energy [1] . SOFC has many advantages, such as high energy-conversion efficiency, low emissions of CO 2 , CO, NO X , SO 2 , no dust, no noise disturbance, fuel and site flexibility and modularity [2] . Single fuel cell consists of two porous electrodes (anode and cathode) separated by a dense, pure ion-conducting electrolyte [3] . The Ni-yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) cermet is generally used as the anode in SOFC because of the low cost of Ni and its relatively high electrocatalytic activity of H 2 oxidation and the reform of other fuel gases that contain carbon [4,5] . It is chemically stable in reducing environment of the fuel at high temperatures, and by the addition of YSZ, its thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) is close to that of YSZ-electrolyte, and it has sufficient porosity to allow the transport of the fuel to and the transport of the products of fuel oxidation away from the electrolyte/anode interface where the fuel oxidation reaction takes place, and should be stable at high temperature [6] . In Ni\u2013YSZ cermet, YSZ constitutes a framework for the dispersion of Ni particles and acts as an inhibitor for the sintering and coarsening of Ni powders at high temperature. Additionally, it offers a significant part of ionic contribution to the overall conductivity, thus broadening the triple phase boundary (TPB) where anode, electrolyte and pores for reaction gas meet. Finally, the thermal expansion coefficient of anode can be managed to match with those of other SOFC components as YSZ is mixed with Ni in an arbitrary ratio [3,7] . The performances of anode could be affected greatly by the quality of raw materials of NiO and YSZ. The results of Jiang and Badwal indicated that the Y-TZP (Ni/3 mol%Y 2 O 3 \u2013ZrO 2 ) in the anode cermet played an important role in modifying the electrode microstructure and kinetics of the fuel oxidation reaction [8] . So, the quality of YSZ powders would have great influences on the performance of the Ni\u2013YSZ cermet. The quality of YSZ powders, including the particle size distribution and the specific surface area, could be influenced greatly by pre-calcining it at different temperature. Accordingly, the performances of the Ni\u2013YSZ cermet could be affected by mixing pre-calcining YSZ powders in NiO. In this paper, the effects of the YSZ pre-calcining temperature on Ni\u2013YSZ cermet will be discussed, including the porosity of open holes, sintering shrinkage characteristic, resistivity after reducing in H 2 and polarization, etc. 2 Experimental The pre-calcined YSZ powders were prepared by firing commercial YSZ powders (China Building Material Academy, Beijing, China) at 900 \u00b0C, 1100 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C for 2 h in air, respectively. The particle size distribution was measured with a Mastersizer 2000 laser size analyzer (Malvern Instrument Ltd., UK) combined with a Hydro2000MU accessory. Water was used as a dispersant, the pump speed was 2000 rpm and the ultrasonic set was 20. NiO nano-powders were synthesized by a precipitation method with Ni(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O and ammonia and finally fired at 400 \u00b0C for 1 h, the average grain size of NiO was 8\u201314 nm. Then the raw powders of NiO, YSZ (commercial powders and the pre-calcined powders at different temperatures) and amylum were mixed in agate mortar for 1 h and dried. The contents of the materials prepared are summarized in Table 1 . Then the mixed powders were divided into three parts. One part was pressed into pellets with a diameter of about 13 mm and a thickness of about 0.5 mm. The green tapes were then sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 2 h. These samples were used to measure the porosity of open holes and the resistivity after reducing in hydrogen. The method of measuring the coefficient of water absorption was used to estimate the porosity of open holes of different samples. This method was achieved by measuring the samples weight before and after absorbing water using FA2004 balance (0.1 mg resolution). The resistivity under reducing atmosphere was measured with the dc four-probe technique using a resistance testing system based on Keithley 2400 SourceMeter and an AI 708 digital controller. The reduction gas was hydrogen provided by a GCH 2500 high purity hydrogen generator. Another part of the powders was pressed into a column which diameter and length were all about 6 mm. These samples were used to investigate the shrinkage characteristics utilizing a Netzsch DIL 402C/3/G dilatometer (Netzsch GmbH, Germany) with air purging. In this measurement, the temperature was raised from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 K/min, and from 500 \u00b0C to 900 \u00b0C at 10 K/min, then holding at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h, finally raised the temperature to 1300 \u00b0C at 10 K/min and holding at 1300 \u00b0C for 2 h. Finally, some adhesives were added in the third part to form slurry. The slurry was coated onto the 8YSZ electrolyte green tapes of pellets with a diameter of 13 mm. The samples were baked at 350 \u00b0C to burn out the adhesives and then co-sintered at 1300 \u00b0C for 10 h. In the sintering process, a ceramic tile as small weight was placed on top of the sample to avoid the pellet's distortion [9] . The anodes on YSZ electrolyte were reduced in H 2 at 700 \u00b0C. Then the silver paste (DAD-87) was painted on to the opposite side of the anode (working electrode) to make cathode and reference electrode. The cathode was symmetrical with respect to the anode and the reference electrode was painted beside the cathode. These samples were then sealed to one end of ceramic tubes by applying the technique of reference [10] . Three-electrode method was used to measure the impedance spectroscopy and polarization of anode in reducing atmosphere (H 2 ) employed SI 1260 Impedance/Gain-phase Analyzer and SI 1287 Electrochemical Interface (Solartron Instruments, UK). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Particle size distribution Fig. 1 shows the particle size distribution curves of raw YSZ powders and the pre-calcined ones at different temperatures. The curves of raw powders, 900 \u00b0C and 1100 \u00b0C pre-calcined powders, show three peaks, they are about 0.6 \u03bcm, 3 \u03bcm and 20 \u03bcm, respectively. During the measurement process, the particle ratio with small and middle size is related with the ultrasonic dispersion. The 3 \u03bcm peak should be depressed along with the ultrasonic dispersion time increasing, at the same time, the 0.6 \u03bcm peak rise up. It means that the middle particles are some soft congeries that may be dispersed by ultrasonic. The 0.6 \u03bcm peak becomes lower with the pre-calcining temperature increased and it disappeared for the powders that pre-calcining at 1200 \u00b0C. According to the particle size distribution data, specific surface area values calculated by Malvern's software are listed in Table 2 . It is obvious that the specific surface area decreased with the pre-calcining temperature increasing. It should be attributed to the aggregating and sintering of small particles. 3.2 Physical characterization XRD patterns of different samples were measured with Dl X-ray diffraction system (Bede Scientific Ltd., UK) and shown in Fig. 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 , there are two phases in the samples, one phase is NiO (PDF number: 78-0643) and the other is cubic YSZ (PDF number: 30-1468). It indicated that the process of pre-calcining had little effect on the crystal structure of YSZ powders. Fig. 3 shows the porosity of open holes of different anode samples before reduction. It can be seen that the porosity of open holes was affected greatly by the pre-calcining temperature of YSZ particles. As shown in Fig. 3 , the porosity of open holes increased along with the pre-calcined temperature increasing. This phenomenon was due to the changes of the YSZ particle grain size and its activity after pre-calcining. It was well known that the appropriate porosity of Ni\u2013YSZ cermet for SOFC application is around 40% [11\u201313] . By considering that about 41% of initial volume of NiO is transferred to pores during NiO reduction to Ni metal, we normally made porosity of sintered NiO\u2013YSZ composite as around 10\u201320% [7] . According to the results in Fig. 3 , the anode material that added in YSZ powders pre-calcined at 900 \u00b0C was adequate to obtain an appropriate porosity. 3.3 Sintering shrinkage Fig. 4 shows the sintering curves of YSZ electrolyte and different anode samples. Atypical sintering curve includes two or more segments, one segment is expanding, the other is shrinking. At lower temperature, the sample expands with temperature increasing and shows positive TEC, over a certain temperature, TEC changes to negative and the shrinkage begin. According to the sintering curves, such parameters, e.g. TEC, starting shrinkage temperature, shrinkage rate and the total shrinkage ratio (sintering step), can be obtained easily. Some parameters of different anode materials are listed in Table 3 . It can be seen that the total shrinkage of YSZ is larger than that of the anode materials. For pure YSZ sample, the sintering curve is very simple and can be divided into expansion segment and shrinkage one at temperature of 891 \u00b0C, and the total shrinkage ratio is 14.76%. However, the curves of NiO\u2013YSZ anode materials are relative complex. There are two or three shrinkage steps in these curves. The first small shrinkage step (less than 1.8%) at lower temperature (<500 \u00b0C) should be attributed to the volatilization and burning of amylum. The following shrinkage steps at higher temperature are sintering step. At the holding temperature of 900 \u00b0C, there is a shrinkage, which is related to the pre-calcining condition of YSZ. The shrinkage for the NZM and NZM900 is larger than that of NZM1100 and NZM1200. It means that the sintering at 900 \u00b0C has been restrained by pre-calcining YSZ powders at higher temperature (over 1000 \u00b0C). Although the sintering shrinkage of NZM1100 and NZM1200 at 900 \u00b0C is too small to be distinguished, the last sintering shrinkage of NZM1100 at 1300 \u00b0C is 13.89%, which is even larger than that of NZM and NZM900 (12.80% and 13.25%, respectively), and it is closer to that of YSZ, 14.76%. For the electrolyte film supported by anode substrate, it was well known that if the sintering shrinkage and thermal expansion of anode substrate were mismatched with that of electrolyte, stress would be generated between the anode substrate and electrolyte film during the preparing and working process of SOFC, and the film or substrate might distort or even crack. Accordingly, the performances of SOFC would be affected greatly. From the results of particle size distribution we can find that the activity of YSZ powder decreases along with the pre-calcining temperature increasing, the particle size and its distribution of YSZ powder changes too. These changes could affect the shrinkage of NiO\u2013YSZ material as shown in Fig. 4 . So, the sintering shrinkage of NiO\u2013YSZ can be adjusted by pre-calcining YSZ powders. It is possible to find a suitable pre-calcining temperature of YSZ powder that sintering shrinkage of anode material containing it would match with YSZ. 3.4 Electrical properties The resistivity of different reduced anode samples versus temperature was shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 shows that the resistivity of different reduced samples increased along with the temperature rising as a mental-type conductor. The electrical conductivity of different anode samples after reducing at room temperature, 700 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C was calculated, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . As shown in Fig. 5 , the pre-calcining temperature of YSZ powders had an obvious effect on the resistivity of the anode. The resistivity of NZM900 was the minimum and that of NZM1200 was the maximum at all temperatures. It would be attributed to the more pores in NZM1200, which block the path for electrical conducting. Single fuel cell was prepared for measuring the polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of different anode materials in hydrogen. Fig. 7 shows the anodic overpotential as a function of current density applied at 750 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C, respectively. As expected, the overpotential at 900 \u00b0C is much smaller than that at 750 \u00b0C when the current density is the same, and the overpotential of different anode materials is different. In comparison with NZM, other anode cermet showed higher anodic overpotential both at 750 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C. Since the specific surface area of raw YSZ powder is higher than that of others, NiO might be dispersed with YSZ adequately to form more reaction zone, so the better electrochemical performance can be obtained by NZM. The anodic overpotential of NZM900 was close to that of NZM, for example, the anodic overpotential of NZM900 was about 55 mV and 22 mV at a current density of 15 mA/cm 2 at 750 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C, respectively, under the same condition, NZM gave the overpotentials of 50 mV and 18 mV, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectra tested at 900 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 8 a . The results of impedance spectra are similar to the results of polarization. Fig. 8 b is the equivalent circuit to fit the impedance spectra. R 1 is the contribution of Ohm polarization, i.e. the total dc resistance including the lead, the electrolyte and electrode material. R 2 is the contribution of electrochemical active polarization, i.e. the charge transfer resistance on electrolyte\u2013anode interface. R w is the contribution of concentration polarization related with diffusion process, i.e. Warburg impedance. The results are listed in Table 4 . It is obvious that both R 2 and R w are increased by adding the pre-calcined YSZ powder. They rise up with pre-calcining temperature of YSZ increasing. The increase of R 2 should be attributed to the decreasing of the specific surface area of YSZ as discussed before. Since there are more YSZ particles with larger size in the anode samples using the pre-calcined YSZ powder, the restraining action which prevent the sintering process of Ni particles in these cermet is not as efficiently as in the one using the raw YSZ powder. As mentioned before, although the porosity of open holes is higher in the cermet with pre-calcining YSZ powder, the nickel particles tend to be sintered together to form a relative dense part in anode and the gas diffusion is still affected. As a result, the Warburg impedance rises up with pre-calcining temperature of YSZ powders at 1100 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C. 4 Conclusion Based on the analysis of the effects of pre-calcined YSZ powders at different temperatures on Ni\u2013YSZ cermet, the following results can be drawn: 1. The porosity of open holes of anode cermet can be affected by doping different YSZ powders of pre-calcining at 900 \u00b0C, 1100 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C. The results indicate that the anode material that added by YSZ powders pre-calcined at 900 \u00b0C was adequate to obtain the appropriate porosity. 2. The sintering shrinkage characteristic of anode cermet is affected by the sinterability of the YSZ powder obviously. We can adjust the sinterability by pre-calcining the YSZ powder at a certain temperature. 3. The conductivity is improved by using the pre-calcined YSZ powder at 900 \u00b0C. And the polarization performance is closed to that of NZM.

        "abstract": "A gravity-electrophoretic deposition method (GD-EPD) was developed for depositing yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) films on porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates. GD-EPD was the method that deposited an additional layer of YSZ by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique on the YSZ film prepared by gravity deposition method (GD). The microstructure of the YSZ film, the performance and impedance spectra of fuel cell prepared by GD-EPD were investigated and compared with that of the YSZ film prepared by only GD method. The SEM photos showed that the size and quantity of the pin-holes in YSZ film has been reduced down by the subsequent EPD process after GD. The output properties of the fuel cell with YSZ film deposited by GD-EPD were obviously improved. The most apparent improvement was the fuel cell's power density of GD-EPD sample that increased seven times from 20 to 144 mW cm \u22122 at intermediate-temperature of 700 \u00b0C than that of GD ones. Keywords A. Films D. ZrO 2 E. Fuel cells Gravity-electrophoretic deposition (GD-EPD) 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been regarded as a kind of green energy in the 21st century [1] , because of its higher energy conversion efficiency, environmentally friendly and low pollutions. Conventional SOFCs based on YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) electrolyte are usually operated at 1000 \u00b0C or more in order to obtain higher power densities. However, the high operating temperature makes the requirements on the materials very strict, such as thermal and chemical stability, conductivity, matching of the thermal expansion coefficient between different materials, etc. In addition, high temperature operation over a long period would incur many problems such as limited material selection and fast performance degradation of cell components [2] . These problems had limited the commercial development of SOFCs. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the operation temperature of SOFC down to 600\u2013800 \u00b0C, while the power density of high temperature is still maintained. One of the challenges associated with lowering the operating temperature is the resulting significant increase in the resistivity of the YSZ electrolyte [3] . An effective approach to overcome this problem is to reduce the thickness of the YSZ electrolyte. There are many techniques applied to produce YSZ films, such as electrochemical vapor deposition (EVD) [4] , chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [5] , physical vapor deposition (PVD) [6] , sol\u2013gel [7] , and ceramic processing methods such as slip casting [8] , electrophoretic deposition (EPD) [9] , centrifugal casting [10] , etc. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. YSZ was a typical ceramic material, thus using ceramic powder processing methods to obtain YSZ film had many potential advantages at preparation technique and reducing the cost of production. In this paper, a new ceramic powder processing method named GD-EPD has been described. In this technique, gravity deposition method (GD) was used firstly to obtain YSZ layer on porous NiO-YSZ anode substrate, and then another ceramic powder processing method called electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was used to make additional layer of YSZ on it. In GD, YSZ particles of larger size can be sedimentated to the surface of the substrate under the gravity of itself in YSZ suspension. In EPD, charged YSZ particles of smaller size can be driven by a dc electric field to move towards the substrate (an oppositely charge electrode), on which they ultimately deposit and form a particulate layer. The aim of the present paper is to use the GD-EPD method to prepare denser YSZ film on NiO-YSZ anode substrate for using in SOFC of intermediate-temperature. 2 Experimental The anode materials (NiO-YSZ) were prepared by mixing YSZ powder (China building material academy, Beijing, China), NiO powder (made by ourselves) and amylums (commercial) by a weight ratio of 5:5:1. The purpose of adding amylums was to form more pores in anode. The mixture was milled in agate mortar for 1 h. Then, the mixed powder was pressed into pellets with a diameter of about 13 mm and a thickness of about 0.6 mm. The pellets were subsequently baked at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h to form the porous NiO-YSZ substrates. A metastable YSZ suspension was obtained by dispersing 1 g of YSZ powders (TZ-8Y, Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in 100 ml of isopropanol and sonicated with a high intensity ultrasonic probe for 10 min. Two porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates were placed on a salver and immerged into the YSZ suspension. The substrates with coatings were taken out 2 h later. Then, the coated pellets were dried in air for 12 h and co-sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h. This process was repeated for four times to get a sufficient thickness. After that, one sample was sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 2 h, which was called 1#. The other one was reduced in hydrogen at 900 \u00b0C for 1 h and then deposited another layer of YSZ by EPD technique, then sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 2 h, which was called 2#. The sedimentation curve of YSZ particle in metastable suspension was measured with a FA2004 balance. In this method, a salver immerged into YSZ suspension was hanged under the balance. Then the deposited mass of YSZ particles was measured by the balance and the data were transferred into computer through RS-232-C standard interface. The thickness of the deposited film could be readily controlled via this method. The sintering curves of YSZ electrolyte and NiO-YSZ anode substrate were investigated with a dilatometer (DIL 402C/3/G Netzsch GmbH, Germany) with air purging. In this measurement, the material powders were pressed into a small bar with a diameter of 6 mm and a height of about 8 mm, the bar was heated from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 K/min in order to burn out the amylums pore-maker smoothly and obtain uniform pores in the NiO-YSZ supporter, and from 500 to 900 \u00b0C at 10 K/min, then holding at 900 \u00b0C for 2 h, finally to 1300 \u00b0C at 10 K/min and holding at 1300 \u00b0C for 2 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photos of YSZ membranes were obtained using Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope. La 0.4 Sr 0.6 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3 (LSCF) powders were synthesized by solid-state reaction method [11] . Some adhesives were put in the powders to form slurry. The slurry was applied on the other side of the two samples and then fired at 300 \u00b0C for 30 min to burn out the adhesives. Finally, the two samples were sintered at 900 \u00b0C for 5 h. To assemble a single fuel cell, a NiO-YSZ/YSZ/LSCF pellet was sealed onto one end of ceramic tubes ( Fig. 1 ) as the method mentioned in reference [10] . The silver layers on both electrode surfaces made from silver paste (DAD-87, Shanghai Research Institute of Synthetic Resin, Shanghai, China) were used as current collectors to collect current on both anode and cathode. Thus, a single fuel cell was prepared and to be tested. In the process of fuel cell testing, the hydrogen was used as fuel and the oxygen in air was used as oxidant. The anode chamber was purged with nitrogen below 500 \u00b0C, and the nitrogen was changed to the fuel gas (H 2 ) at 500 \u00b0C. The I \u2013 V curves of single cell were measured with Solartron 1287 (Solartron Instruments, Hampshire, England) Electrochemical Interface at potentiodynamic mode, the potential was scanned from open circuit value to zero with a rate of 10 mV/s, potential and current data were both collected synchronously. The impedance spectra of fuel cells were measured with Solartron 1287 Electrochemical Interface combined with SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer when the cell performances were tested, the frequency range is from 910 kHz to 0.5 Hz. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Sintering shrinkage characteristic of YSZ electrolyte and NiO-YSZ anode Fig. 2 shows the sintering curves of YSZ electrolyte and NiO-YSZ anode. A typical sintering curve usually includes two segments. One segment is expanding, the other is shrinking. At lower temperature, the sample expands with temperature increasing and shows positive thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), over a certain temperature, TEC changes to negative and the shrinkage begin. According to the sintering curves, such parameters, e.g., TEC, starting shrinkage temperature, shrinkage rate and the total shrinkage ratio (sintering step) can be obtained easily. From Fig. 2 , it can be seen that the starting shrinkage temperature was almost the same but the total shrinkage ratio of YSZ electrolyte was larger than that of NiO-YSZ anode. This mismatch would produce stress during co-sintering process and some cracks in electrolyte film might be formed. So the co-sintering process should be controlled carefully. 3.2 Sedimentation curve of YSZ particles Fig. 3 shows the sedimentation curve of YSZ particles in YSZ suspension. The sediment mass increased rapidly in the first 10 min, corresponding to the sedimentation of bigger YSZ particles, then the sedimentation rate became slow, corresponding to the sedimentation of smaller YSZ particles. According to the data of sedimentation curve the mass of deposited YSZ particles could be estimated, then the thickness of the film could be calculated according to Eq. (1) . (1) h = m ( \u03c1 P \u2212 \u03c1 L ) A 1 D In this equation, h is the thickness of the deposited film, m is the deposited mass measured by balance, \u03c1 P is the density of YSZ particles, \u03c1 L is the density of solvent, D is a factor related with the relative density of the film, and A is the area of the substrate. If we presumed the film is dense enough, D equals 1. Then the thickness of YSZ film deposited for 2 h is about 5.5 \u03bcm. So, the thickness of YSZ film should be about 22 \u03bcm by repeating this process for four times. 3.3 Results of SEM Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show the scanning electron micrographs of 1# sample. It can be seen that the surface of YSZ film prepared only by GD technique was sintered well. The particles of submicron were agglomerated to grains with size of several microns and sintered together. In this sample, the grain boundaries were clear enough to be distinguished. However, there still exist some holes, the sizes of which were less than 1 \u03bcm. The shape and size of these holes were not uniform. These holes were probably formed during the sedimentation process and they may affect the electrical conductivity of electrolyte and the open voltage (OCV) of the fuel cell. Fig. 4 (c) and (d) show the scanning electron micrographs of 2# sample. It is obvious that the size and the amount of the holes in 2# sample were less than that of 1# sample. In addition, the grain boundaries of 2# sample were not as clear as that of 1#. It proved that another YSZ layer by EPD technique on the YSZ surface prepared by GD and sintering for longer time can improve the performance of YSZ film. We can expect this membrane provide a better property of conductivity and OCV of fuel cell. 3.4 Properties of fuel cells Fig. 5 (a) shows the performance of the fuel cell made from 1# sample. The maximum open circuit voltage was 0.98 V at 620 \u00b0C. It was less than the theoretical one (about 1.23 V). This difference should be attributed to the open and gas-permeable holes existing in the YSZ electrolyte film. A small amount of fuel gas might leak out through these holes and cause the cathode potential dropping down. In addition, the shrinkage of YSZ film and NiO-YSZ anode substrate was not coincident during co-sintering ( Fig. 2 ), it could produce very large stress between the film and the substrate to form a few micron cracks which would influence the performances of the fuel cell, not only the open circuit voltage, but also the current density and the power density. The current density and power density of this fuel cell were 0.54 A/cm 2 and 105 mW/cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C, 0.27 A/cm 2 and 57 mW/cm 2 at 750 \u00b0C, 0.09 A/cm 2 and 20 mW/cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C, respectively. Fig. 5 (b) shows the performance of the fuel cell made from 2# sample. The current density and power density were 1.33 A/cm 2 and 270 mW/cm 2 at 800 \u00b0C, 1.12 A/cm 2 and 245 mW/cm 2 at 750 \u00b0C, 0.73 A/cm 2 and 144 mW/cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C, respectively. It can be seen that the performances of 2# sample are better than that of 1#. The improvements could be attributed to the additional layer in 2# sample. In GD process, most of the deposited particles were the bigger ones. Although the process was repeated for four times, there were still a few holes and some flaws of micron size in the membrane. In contrast, the EPD process could deposit smaller particles with submicron size onto the substrate, so that the holes might be filled with these small ones. In fact, the smaller particles with positive charge tend to move to the region with higher electrical conductance. Since the electrical conductance in the holes and flaws filled with suspension should be higher than other regions (sintered YSZ membrane), the holes and flaws may be filled firstly. So the film prepared by combination of GD and EPD becomes denser and exhibits better performance. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the impedance spectra of 1# and 2# sample during the cell test. From the figures, we could see obviously that the resistance of the electrolyte decreased in both samples when the operating temperature increased. Correspondingly, the performance of the two samples got better. According to the comparison result of impedances of the two cells at different operating temperature, the improvement of the additional YSZ layer prepared by EPD is evident. The total resistance reduced from about 8 \u03a9 cm 2 of 1# cell down to 0.66 \u03a9 cm 2 of 2# cell and the output power density raised seven times from 20 to 144 mW/cm 2 at 700 \u00b0C. In Fig. 6 , the spectra are not ideal semicircles and show highly depressed and skewed because two primary factors may influence the impedance spectra of fuel cell. Firstly, the reason for highly depressed semicircle is that the interfaces between electrolyte film and electrodes are rough and the impedance spectra show the feature of a parallel circuit of constant phase element (CPE) and resistance. Secondly, the skewed semicircle at high frequency region is the combining contribution of the wire's inductance (about 0.7 \u03bcH) and the YSZ electrolyte's capacitance (about 10 \u22128 F magnitude). In some impedance spectroscopy, the low frequency end is also skew to low impedance direction because of temperature fluctuation. In the impedance spectra, the intercepts at the high frequency end mainly represent the resistance of YSZ electrolyte and a small contact resistance of Ag current collector on electrode. Neglecting the small contact resistance, the area specific resistance (ASR) of YSZ electrolyte film versus the working temperature of the two samples are obtained and shown in Fig. 7 . It can be seen that the area specific resistance of 2# sample at any temperature is less than that of 1#. However, it should be noticed that the value of the area specific resistance of 2# at 750 and 800 \u00b0C were almost the same. This phenomenon should be attributed to the reducing of NiO to Ni and subsequent sintering of anode. In the sintering process, the small Ni particles might gather together to form larger ones and the electrochemical properties of the anode might become worse during the temperature increased from 750 to 800 \u00b0C. This problem might influence the stability of fuel cell during a long operating period. So, more research about the anode should be carried out in order to avoid this problem. 4 Conclusion The present results show the GD-EPD technique can be used to prepare denser YSZ film on porous NiO-YSZ anode substrate. By the GD process repeated four times, a YSZ film of certain thickness can be obtained but there were still some holes or flaws of micron size in it. The subsequent EPD process could repair relative large holes or flaws (micron size). The fuel cell prepared by GD-EPD (GD-EPD cell) shows a better performance than the one prepared by GD (GD cell) especially at lower temperature of 700 \u00b0C, e.g., the power density of the GD-EPD cell was 144 mW/cm 2 and that of the GD cell was only 20 mW/cm 2 . The method combining the GD and EPD is a simpler, easier and lower cost one for preparing the YSZ film.

        "abstract": "Ni\u2013Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 anode-supported YSZ electrolyte films were fabricated and a fuel cell based on this film was tested in this paper. The anode/YSZ film interface was investigated by means of SEM\u2013EDX. The SEM results showed that the YSZ film was almost fully dense and crack-free. The analyses of EDX revealed that Ce and Sm cations preferential migrated from the NiO\u2013SDC anode into the YSZ film for less than 3 \u03bcm while no significant diffusion occurred for Y and Zr. A cell of Ni\u2013SDC/YSZ(14 \u03bcm)/LSM\u2013YSZ was tested from 700 to 850 \u00b0C using humidified hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant. The cell provided maximum power densities of 304, 625, 980 and 1270 mW/cm 2 at 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. Polarization analysis based on the impedance spectra showed that the anode polarization only accounted for 8% of the total electrode polarization while this ratio for cathode was 92%. A negligible anode polarization suggested that the diffusion of Ce and Sm and its negative effect on the performance of the cell were suppressed to an acceptable level in this study. Keywords Ceramics Fuel cells Thin films Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Scanning electron microscopy 1 Introduction Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which can convert chemical energy directly to electrical power with high efficiency and low pollution, attract more and more attentions in recent decades [1\u20134] . To date, YSZ is the most commonly used electrolyte materials in SOFCs because it possesses unique combination of properties such as excellent mechanical strength, high chemical and thermal stability in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres and pure oxygen ionic conductivity over a wide range of conditions. However, oxygen ionic conductivity of YSZ is insufficient for SOFCs which operating at intermediate temperature (600\u2013800 \u00b0C). The conventional SOFCs based on YSZ electrolyte usually operate at high temperature such as 1000 \u00b0C or more to obtain good performance. However, operating SOFCs at such a high temperature may cause a series of problems such as electrode sintering, interfacial diffusion, and thermal mismatch. Therefore, it is difficult to expect a long-term stability. For these reasons, great efforts have been made towards the development of intermediate temperature SOFCs [5,6] . To reduce the operation temperature, the following two approaches can be considered: one way is to replace the traditional YSZ electrolyte with doped-CeO 2 or doped-LaGaO 3 which has higher ionic conductivity than YSZ; the other way is to reduce the thickness of YSZ electrolyte. This paper correlates with the latter case because of the excellent combination properties of YSZ. Ni-YSZ cermet is a conventional anode materials for YSZ electrolyte-based SOFCs. Compared with the Ni-YSZ cermet anode, Ni-doped-CeO 2 anode has its advantages. The doped-CeO 2 is an ion-and-electron mixed conductor in hydrogen which can increase the length of three-phase boundary (TPB) within anode. Doped-CeO 2 -based anode is more suitable for oxidation of hydrocarbon because of its high activity for hydrocarbon oxidation and its high ionic conductivity [7] . Among the doped-CeO 2 materials, Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) has the highest ionic conductivity [8] . NiO\u2013SDC anode was selected in this study for fabrication of anode-supported YSZ film SOFCs. It is reported that doped-CeO 2 reacts with stabilized-ZrO 2 at elevated temperature forming CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 -based solid solutions which have a low electrical conductivity [9] . Shiono et al. [10] introduced a Ce 0.9 Gd 0.1 O 2\u2212 \u03b4 (GDC) interlayer between Scandia-stabilized zirconia (SSZ) electrolyte and La 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3\u2212 \u03b4 (LSC) cathode to avoid the reaction between them. They found that the reaction between SSZ electrolyte and GDC interlayer was not observed at 1320 \u00b0C. Ni-YSZ anodes were usually used to support the YSZ electrolyte thin films. There are few publications on application of Ni\u2013SDC anode-supported YSZ films in SOFCs. Xu et al. [11] fabricated NiO\u2013SDC anode-supported YSZ electrolyte films by spin-coating and co-firing method. The cell based on this film showed a maximum power density of 535 mW/cm 2 at 750 \u00b0C. However, the diffusion at the NiO\u2013SDC anode and YSZ film interface was not investigated in their reports. In this paper, YSZ film was prepared on NiO\u2013SDC green anode substrate by slurry-casting method. The interface between NiO\u2013SDC anode and YSZ electrolyte was examined by SEM\u2013EDX. The performances of the Ni\u2013SDC anode-supported YSZ films SOFCs were tested and discussed. 2 Experimental 2.1 Preparation of starting powders NiO powder was prepared by ammonia precipitation method. Ammonia (analytical reagent, A.R.) was added to Ni(NO 3 ) 2 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R.) solution drop by drop to obtain nickel hydroxide deposition. Then, the as-prepared deposition was aged at 70 \u00b0C for 40 min. After washing by alcohol and drying at 105 \u00b0C, the resultant deposition was finally fired at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h to get nickel oxide powder. SDC (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 ) powder was prepared by a citric-nitrate process. Stoichiometric amounts of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 \u00b76H 2 O (A.R.) and Sm 2 O 3 (A.R.) were dissolved in diluted HNO 3 (A.R.) and citric acid (A.R.) was added as the complexant. The molar ratio of total cation to citric acid was 1/1.15. The solution was evaporated at 75 \u00b0C to form a transparent gel. After drying at 100 \u00b0C for 12 h, the transparent gel changed to a brown dry gel. The dry gel was subsequently fired at 750 \u00b0C for 2 h to get SDC powder. La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSM) was used as the cathode material in this study. The method for preparation of LSM powder was similar to that for SDC powder as described above. The starting materials for LSM powder preparation were all analytical reagent in this study. The LSM powder was obtained by firing the as-prepared dry gel at 1000 \u00b0C for 4 h. X-ray diffraction (Bede D 1 X-ray diffraction meter) was used to confirm the crystalline structure of the prepared powders. All the powders of NiO, SDC and LSM exhibited the expected phase structure without impure phases. 2.2 Preparation of NiO\u2013SDC anode substrates The as-prepared NiO and SDC powders were mixed in a weight ratio of 1:1. In addition, 15 wt.% starch was added as pore former to get sufficient porosity. After mixing and grinding, the anode powder was pressed into pellets of 13 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness under a pressure of 260 MPa. The green pellets were pre-sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 3 h to get the NiO\u2013SDC anode substrates. 2.3 Preparation of YSZ electrolyte film and LSM\u2013YSZ composite cathode YSZ powder with an average particle size of 0.2 \u03bcm bought from Tosoh corporation (TZ-8Y, Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was chosen to make thin electrolyte films in this study. Terpineol-ethylcellulose vehicle was used to prepare YSZ slurry. YSZ powder was mixed with terpineol-ethylcellulose vehicle in an agate mortar and ground for about 2 h to get a homogeneous and stable YSZ paste. The slurry contained 80 wt.% of YSZ and 20 wt.% of terpineol-ethylcellulose vehicle. Fig. 1 showed a schematic diagram of YSZ film fabrication equipment. The equipment was composed of a flat holder and a revolving rod. The flat holder was used to fix and support the anode substrate for slurry-casting. A certain amount of YSZ slurry was dropped on one side of anode and compacted by the revolving rod. The casting force helped to obtain green YSZ films with high density, which led to dense sintered films. After being dried in air, the anode/YSZ bilayer was fired at 1400 \u00b0C for 4 h to increase the density of YSZ film. The LSM\u2013YSZ composition cathode was prepared using screen-printing technique. LSM and YSZ powders were mixed in a weight ratio of 1.5:1, and then the mixed powders were mixed with terpineol-ethylcellulose vehicle and ground for about 1 h to get a stable cathode printing ink. After that, the LSM\u2013YSZ printing ink was printed onto YSZ electrolyte surface by screen-printing technique and then sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for 3 h. The cathode size is 0.5 cm 2 . 2.4 Characteristics of YSZ film and anode/YSZ film interface Morphology and microstructure of the YSZ film were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The density of the film was estimated by the dimensions and the weight of the film. The anode/YSZ film interface was examined by SEM\u2013EDX. The EDX analysis at interface was carried out in a line-scan mode with a probe diameter less than 1 \u03bcm. 2.5 Single cell testing Silver paste was current collectors for both anode and cathode. A four-probe set-up was adopted to eliminate the resistive loss in the silver wires. A reference electrode was attached to electrolyte film in the vicinity of the cathode to separate the cathode polarization from that of anode. Hydrogen saturated with water at room temperature was used as fuel while oxygen in the ambient air was used as oxidant. The single cell was tested in the temperature range of 700\u2013850 \u00b0C. The cell performance and impedance spectroscopy were measured by SI-1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer in combination with SI-1287 electrochemical interface (Solartron Instruments, Hampshire, U.K.). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Microstructures of supported YSZ film and single cell Fig. 2 showed SEM micrographs of supported YSZ film and a single cell with a 14-\u03bcm-thick YSZ film. Fig. 2 (a) was a surface micrograph of YSZ film before sintering, which showed an underdeveloped microstructure with small grains. There were some pinholes in the green YSZ film, which came from the volatilization of terpineol-ethylcellulose vehicle during the film drying process. Fig. 2 (b) showed the YSZ film surface micrograph after sintering at 1400 \u00b0C. All pinholes disappeared and the YSZ thin film was composed of grains of irregular shape. The grain size varied from 1 to 5 \u03bcm without any crack and pinhole. Fig. 2 (c) and (d) presented the cross-sections of anode/YSZ film bilayer before and after sintering at high temperature, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 (c), there was a clear boundary between the anode and supported YSZ film. After sintered at high temperature, as shown in Fig. 2 (d), the boundary disappeared and an interlocking boundary came into being. The green YSZ film was very dense with a relative density of about 45%. After sintering at high temperature, the relative density increased to about 97%. In this study, the stable YSZ slurry, which contained up to 80 wt.% of YSZ particles, was used to prepare YSZ film. This paste led to a green YSZ film with a small amount of organic additive compared with the conventional slurry coating [12] . Furthermore, the casting force also helped to compress the green YSZ film, leading a dense sintered film after sintering. It was believed that the high-quality sintered YSZ film was ascribed to the dense green YSZ film as shown in Fig. 2 (c). Fig. 2 (e) showed a single cell of Ni\u2013SDC/YSZ(14 \u03bcm)/LSM\u2013YSZ. The electrochemical testing in this paper was based on this cell. The YSZ film was fully dense while both the Ni\u2013SDC anode and LSM\u2013YSZ composite cathode were porous. 3.2 SEM\u2013EDX analysis at anode/YSZ film interface Fig. 3 (a) showed the cross-section of the NiO\u2013SDC anode/YSZ film interface after sintering. The YSZ film was homogeneous and almost pinhole-free in the cross-section. The results of EDX analyses for Y, Zr, Sm and Ce at anode/YSZ interface were presented in Fig. 3 (b). It was observed that there was no significant diffusion occurred for Y and Zr. The Ce and Sm cations migrated from NiO\u2013SDC anode into the supported YSZ film for less than 3 \u03bcm. These diffusions of Ce and Sm cations resulted in CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 -based solid solutions in the YSZ film side. Mitsuyasu et al. [13] have investigated the solid state reaction at the interface of Y 2 O 3 -doped-CeO 2 (YDC) and YSZ by XRD. Their XRD results showed that the solid state reaction between YDC and YSZ accompanied a significant shift of the zirconia lines to lower angle while no obvious lines shift observed for ceria. They believed that the reaction between ceria and zirconia proceeded by preferential migration of the ceria component into the zirconia side. Tsoga et al. [9] also found a similar phenomenon between GDC and YSZ interface. Our experiment results suggested the reaction at the interface between the NiO\u2013SDC anode and the YSZ film mainly resulted from the migration of the Ce and Sm cations into the YSZ side. 3.3 Results of electrochemical testing The temperature dependence of cell performance in the temperature range of 700\u2013850 \u00b0C were shown in Fig. 4 . The observed open circuit voltages (OCVs) of higher than 1.0 V implied that the gas leakage across YSZ film was insignificant. The maximum power densities were 304, 625, 980 and 1270 mW/cm 2 at 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. The present fuel cell performance is better than that of previous reported Ni\u2013SDC anode-supported YSZ electrolyte films SOFCs [11] . The impedances of the whole cell and the half cell (cathode side only) tested at 800 \u00b0C were shown in Fig. 5 . For the whole cell impedance, the intercepts on the real axis at high frequency corresponded to the cell ohmic resistance while the arcs at intermediate and low frequency were the whole electrodes polarization resistance including both anode and cathode polarization. For the half cell impedance, the intercepts on the real axis at high frequency also corresponded to the ohmic resistance while the arcs at intermediate and low frequency were only the cathode polarization resistance. The inset in Fig. 5 showed an equivalent circuit which was used to resolve the impedance data. The fitting results were listed in Table 1 . The whole electrode (including both cathode and anode) polarization resistance is 0.288 \u03a9 cm 2 while the polarization resistance for cathode process is 0.267 \u03a9 cm 2 . It could be readily seen that the cathode polarization accounted for up to 92% of the total electrode polarization while the anode polarization was almost negligible. As shown in Fig. 3 , the diffusions of Ce and Sm cations from NiO\u2013SDC anode into YSZ film resulted in a CeO 2 \u2013ZrO 2 -based solid solution on the YSZ side, which had low electrical conductivity. This solid solution restricted the anode reaction and thus resulted in a high anode polarization. From the analyses of impedance, the anode polarization only accounted for about 8% of the total electrode polarization at 800 \u00b0C. This result suggested that the diffusion of Ce and Sm and its effect on performance of the cell were kept at an acceptable level in this study. Tsoga et al. [9] reported that although pure GDC reacted readily with YSZ at elevated temperature, suppression of the reaction between YSZ and GDC could be achieved in the presence of Ni because of the good chemical compatibility of Ni for both YSZ and ceria. They recommended that a ceria\u201340 vol.% Ni cermet should be considered when ceria was to be employed at the YSZ electrolyte and Ni\u2013YSZ anode interface to reduce anode polarization losses. The insignificant reaction between NiO\u2013SDC and YSZ film in this study seemed to agree with this case. 4 Conclusions Ni\u2013SDC anode-supported YSZ films were prepared by slurry casting to study the solid reaction at the interface of the anode and the supported YSZ film and to evaluate the performances of the fuel cells. A compacted YSZ green film with relative density of 45% was obtained after one-time coating. The relative density of the YSZ film increased to 97% after sintered at 1400 \u00b0C for 4 h. The SEM\u2013EDX analyses showed that there was not obvious diffusion occurred for Y and Zr. On the other hand, Ce and Sm cations migrated from NiO\u2013SDC anode into the supported YSZ film for less than 3 \u03bcm. A single cell, Ni\u2013SDC/YSZ/LSM\u2013YSZ, was tested using humidified hydrogen as fuel and ambient air as oxidant from 700 to 850 \u00b0C. The open circuit voltage of above 1.0 V was observed. The cell provided the maximum power densities of 304, 625, 980 and 1270 mW/cm 2 at 700, 750, 800 and 850 \u00b0C, respectively. The cell performance was basically limited by cathode polarization, instead of anode polarization and electrolyte ohmic resistance. The effect of the interfacial reaction between NiO\u2013SDC anode and YSZ film on the performance of the cell was not significant in this study.

With increasing Co content, both the degree of cationic order and the saturation magnetic moment per formula unit of these compounds increase, while their resistivity decreases monotonically and exhibits an enhanced metallic behaviour for x\u22650.15. The low-field magnetoresistance was greatly enhanced at x \u2264 0.15, and the field dependence of magnetoresistance for x\u22650.15 almost saturates above 1.5 T. These results can be well explained by the change of magnetic structure of Sr2FeMoO6 after replacing partial Fe ions by Co ions. The enhanced metallic behaviour and low-field magnetoresistance also suggest a great application potential in spin electronic devices. \u00a9 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The emission enhancement under UV excitation originates from the energy transfer from Bi 3+ to Er3+, while under IR excitation it can be attributed to the modification of the local crystal field around the Er3+. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This new synthesis route has several advantages. XRD analysis shows a cubic cell for the samples. XPS of the surface and EPR measurements indicate that the Ti ions have a mixed valence of 3+ and 4+ and that A-cation vacancies exist in the samples. As x increases, the amount of Ti3+ ions and A-cation vacancies decreases. The valence state of the Ti ions can be altered by changing both pressure and temperature. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Single phase magnetite films were deposited on n -type silicon substrates using laser molecular beam epitaxy. When the temperature is increased beyond 230 K, the resistance drops rapidly because the conduction path starts to switch from the Fe3 O4 film to the inversion layer underneath the native SiO2 via thermally assisted tunneling. A large negative magnetoresistance is observed at about 230 K, and this maximum shifts to higher temperature with increasing film thickness. Hall effect data of the structure show that the carriers are holes above the channel switching temperature. Our results confirm that the large magnetoresistance at \u223c230 K originates from the amplification of the magnetoresistance of the magnetite in the Fe3 O4 - SiO2 -Si structure. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

The results indicate that short-range ferromagnetic clusters coexist with the glassy magnetic state, i.e., a cluster-glass phase between T(f) and T(G) and a spin-glass-like phase below T(f). The clear evidence of memory effects in the dc magnetization is also observed below T(f) and T(G), respectively. These two glassy states with cooperative relaxation processes may derive from the different interaction processes among nanoscale ferromagnetic clusters mediated by the matrix, which is influenced by changing the spin state of Co(3+) ions in spontaneously phase-separated cobaltite.",

XRD and SEM measurements show that the sintering after cold-high-pressure compacting is helpful to align the c-axis of layered grain within the sample along the pressing direction, i.e. the sample is highly textured. The thermoelectric properties of NaCo2O4, measured below room temperature exhibit a metallic behavior in both the resistivity \u03c3 and Seebeck coefficient S. The sign of S is positive, indicating a p-type thermoelectric material. Compared with the samples prepared with other methods, although the thermal conductivity is higher due to the suppression of the phonon scattering by grain boundary or point defect, the above sample exhibits lower \u03c3 and higher S which leads to the improvement of the ZT value that reaches 0.013 at 300K.",

By studying the impedance spectroscopy of the electrolyte material in the working environment of a fuel cell, we found that the conducting types vary with the variation of atmosphere.

        "abstract": "The temperature and field dependences of the specific heat of single-crystal NdMn03 were investigated from 2K to 200K under different fields up to 8 T. Corresponding to the Type-A antiferromagnetic (A-AF) phase transition in the Mn sub-lattice, the specific heat under zero field exhibited a sharp \u03bb-shaped peak at about 85 K, which was depressed and broadened and changed smoothly with the increase of magnetic field. But the entropy change due to the magnetic order is only 26% of the expected value, which might arise from the extension of the magnetic fluctuation in a larger temperature range. The specific heat curves exhibited a shoulder-shaped Schottky-like anomaly below 20K, whose maximum shifts gradually to higher temperatures with the magnetic field. By considering the contributions to the specific heat at low temperatures, the above phenomena can be interpreted in terms of the model of effective molecular field (Hmf) at Nd3+ site that causes the splitting of the ground state doublet (GSD) of Nd3+. The specific heat below 20K under different magnetic fields was successfully fitted, through which the meaningful parameters, including the splitting of the GSD of Nd3+, Debye temperature and the A-AF spin wave stiffness coefficients, as well as their field dependence were obtained. It was found that the ferromagnetic component of the Mn sub-lattice caused by the GdFeO3-type octahedron rotation could be the origin of the Hmf.",

        "title": "Magnetic properties and colossal magnetoresistance of La5/6Na1/6Mn1\u2212yFeyO3 with 0\u2264y\u22640.10",
        "abstract": "The effect of Fe doping (0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.10) in Mn site was studied for the colossal magnetoresistance material La 5/6 Na 1/6 MnO 3 . The same size of Fe 3+ and Mn 3+ causes no structure change in the series, yet conduction and ferromagnetism have been consistently suppressed by Fe doping. Doping with Fe causes no dominant lattice effects. It depopulates the hopping electrons and weakens the double exchange. ZFC and FC magnetization curve at 0.01 T field shows irreversibility. The temperature dependence of resistivity shows that all samples undergo a transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic with the decrease of temperature. However, for y = 0.10 sample, two obvious peaks are observed in the magnetoresistance versus temperature curve at 5 T field. The high-field MR effect may have its origin in a small canting of the manganese moments inside each domain even for H > H s . The canting angle becomes smaller and therefore electrons transfer more easily between pairs of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions under high field. This will lead to a MR effect. Keywords Magnetoresistance Electrical transport Exchange and superexchange 1 Introduction Mixed valence manganese oxides R 1\u2212 x A x MnO 3 (R stands for rare earth metals and A for divalent metals like Ca, Sr, and Ba) with perovskite structure have been extensively studied due to the challenge of the theoretical understanding, as well as the application potential of the so-called colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect [1\u20133] . These perovskite manganites exhibit metal-insulator transition, various magnetic phases, charge ordering, orbital ordering, Jahn-Teller effect and other interesting phenomena. [4\u201310] . The double exchange interaction proposed by Zenner [5] provides a quanlitative explanation. The localized spins of Mn ions interact with each other via the motion of the conduction electrons. The spins of the conduction electrons are coupled to the localized spins and thus form energy levels according to the Hund's rule. Ferromagnetism facilitates the motion of the conduction electrons and lowers the kinetic energy. The electron transport responses to the variation of the magnetic structure induced by an external magnetic field, leading to CMR phenomenon. [8\u201311] . To understand the CMR mechanism, it is very important to perform investigation on the doping of transition elements at Mn site because of the core role of Mn ions in CMR materials. Mn site doping effects with transition elements have been extensively investigated [12,13] . The effects of substitution on the Mn site by other transition element is further known to affect the properties due to the changes produced in the average electron concentration and the shifts in the position of the e g and t g sub-bands. A number of studies [14] have been conducted on the effects of the substitution of Mn by various transition elements. The case of Fe is particularly interesting because of the large extent to which it can substitute for Mn. Ahn [15] et al. show that the observed decrease in T C in consistent with a weakening of the double exchange on the introduction of the Fe. It is apparent, from various studies,that the Fe atom substitutes for Mn at s valence state of +3 and is not involved in double exchange,thereby leading to a lowering of T C . Recent studies [16\u201318] have shown that the onset of the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition is accompanied by a divergence of the correlation length, signaling the growth of the infinite correlation and an inhomogeneous type of ferromagnetic transition. It can be expected that the effect of the Fe doping result in the formation of cluster and the suppression of conductivity. We have conducted a study of the magnetic and transport effect in a series of Fe-doped CMR compounds of La 5/6 Na 1/6 Mn 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3 with y varying as 0 \u2264 y \u2264 0.1. 2 Experiments La 5/6 Na 1/6 Mn 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3 ( y = 0, 0.05, 0.10) bulk samples were synthesized by sol\u2013gel technique. Stoichiometric nitrates dissolved in aqueous solution were used as the starting chemicals. Citric acid was used as the chelating reagent. After adding a suitable amount of citric acid to the solution and stirring, uniform gel was obtained which then evaporated at about 110 \u00b0C to yield a xerogel mixture. The gelatin was subsequently calcined at 400 \u00b0C for 5 h to decompose the organic substance. The resultant powder was then ground, pelletized and sintered at 1000 \u00b0C for 18 h with an intermediate regrinding, then furnace cooled to room temperature. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed with a Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The temperature dependence of magnetization ( M \u2013 T ) under both zero field cooling (ZFC) and 0.01 T field cooling (FC) condition was measured by a quantum design physical properties measurement system (PPMS). The temperature dependence of resistivity ( \u03c1 \u2013 T ) was measured by the standard four-probe method from 10 to 350 K. The magnetoresistance (MR) is defined as MR(%) = [ \u03c1 (0)- \u03c1 ( H )]/ \u03c1H \u00d7 100%, where \u03c1 (0) and \u03c1 ( H ) is the resistivity at zero field and applied magnetic fields, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the La 5/6 Na 1/6 Mn 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3 ( y = 0, 0.05, 0.10) collected at room temperature. All peaks were indexed on the basis of orthorhombic unit cell. The lattice parameters are a = 0.549, b = 0.547 and c = 0.775 nm. We do not observe any appreciable change in the lattice parameters with increasing Fe concentration. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Magnetic properties The temperature dependence of the dc magnetization M ( T ) measured in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes under an applied of 0.01 T is shown in Fig. 2 for all samples. It shows typical ferromagnetic features. The Curie temperature T C (defined as the peak temperature of the d M /d T versus T curve) as well as low-temperature magnetization decreases with increasing Fe doping level. Irreversibility between the ZFC and FC magnetization curves is clearly seen close to the ferromagnetic transition temperature T C . The thermomagnetic irreversibility arises from the magnetic anisotropy due to the difference between FC and ZFC measurements. The response of the spin to the external magnetic field depends on the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the applied magnetic field strength. At low measuring fields, compared to the anisotropy field, all the spins will not be oriented in the direction of the applied magnetic field. The magnitude of M ZFC at low temperature below the T C will depend on the anisotropy. The difference between M FC and M ZFC will be larger for the highly anisotropic compounds. Hence, the irreversibility between M FC and M ZFC are due to their magnetic anisotropy. The magnetization as a function of the applied magnetic field at 10 K is showed in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that for all samples, the magnetizations reach saturation at about 1 T and remain almost constant up to 5 T. It is considered as a result of the rotation of the magnetic domain under the action of the applied magnetic field. The value of the saturated magnetic moment for all samples decreases with the addition of Fe as shown inset of Fig. 3 . 3.2 Electrical properties The temperature dependence of the resistivity for La 5/6 Na 1/6 Mn 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3 ( y = 0, 0.05, 0.10) at H = 0 T, H = 1 T and H = 5 T from 10 to 300 K is shown in Fig. 4 . The measured data shows fairly sharp metal-insulator transition at T IM . The resistivity enhances with the increasing doping content, while decreases with the applied field. The insulator\u2013metal transition temperature ( T IM ) shifts to lower temperature with the increasing of Fe content. In the perovskite oxides [19,20] , the 3d level of the Mn and Fe ions is known to split into t 2g\u2191 , e g\u2191 , t 2g\u2193 , and e g\u2193 . The electronic configurations are t 2 g \u2191 3 e g \u2191 2 for Fe 3+ , t 2 g \u2191 3 e g \u2191 1 for Fe 4+ and Mn 3+ , and t 2 g \u2191 3 e g \u2191 0 for Mn 4+ , respectively. For these ions, the t 2g\u2191 bands are fully occupied.The t 2g\u2193 and e g\u2193 bands are empty. The e g\u2191 bands, which can accommodate a maximum of two electrons per ion, play a crucial role. In a mixed system of Fe and Mn, the widths and energies of their e g\u2191 bands indicate the electron distribution of the Fe and Mn ions. Ahn et al. [21] studied the effect of Fe-doping on transport property of La 1\u2212 x Ca x Mn 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3 ( x = 0.37 and 0.53, y < 0.2), and proposed that the Fermi surface of the system lie at 0.14\u20130.29 eV above the top of the Fe e g\u2191 band. Electron hopping from Mn to Fe is energetically forbidden even at room temperature. Consequently, double exchange is suppressed, resulting in the reduction of ferromagnetism and metallic conduction. Furthermore the T C and saturation magnetization are decreased while the \u03c1 and CMR are increased. In order to discuss further physical mechanism of transport properties, we fit the curve of resistivity versus temperature when T > T IM using Mott's variable range hopping expression In ( \u03c1 ) \u223c ( T 0 / T ) 1/4 , K B T 0 \u2248 18/[ \u03b6 3 N ( E )] [22\u201324] . In this expression \u03be is the localization of length and N ( E ) is the density of states. The y = 0.10 sample is fitted as shown in Fig. 6 .The better accordance with variable range hopping modes indicates the formation of cluster or domain where e g\u2191 electron has to hop between them resulting in a semiconducting behaviors. The fit results can give T 0 that can be used to obtain the confinement length \u03be . With the density of states N ( E ) = 9 \u00d7 10 26 m 3 ev \u22121 (Ref. 25) and T 0 , it is found that the localization length decreases from \u03be \u2248 0.066 nm for y = 0, \u03be \u2248 0.021 nm for y = 0.05 and \u03be \u2248 0.005 nm for y = 0.10, which indicates the increase of the charge-carrier localization intensity. It also indicates that double exchange interaction decreases with the increase of the Fe-doping level, possibly due to the formation of magnetic cluster. In the low-temperature ( T < T IM ) where the transport property shows the metallic state, it seems to be governed by the electron scattering process. \u03c1 ( T ) is well fit by the empirical equation \u03c1 = \u03c1 0 + \u03c3 T n ( n = 2 and 2.5). Here \u03c1 0 associates with the domain boundaries and other temperature-independent scattering mechanism. [26] The result indicates that for the \u03c1 ( T ) with y = 0.05 and 0.10, the equation with n = 2.5 fits the data well, which represents a combination effect of electron\u2013electron, electron\u2013phonon, and electron\u2013magnon scattering. However, for the \u03c1 ( T ) with y = 0, the equation with n = 2 fits the data better, which shows that the resistivity is mainly attributed to the electron\u2013electron scattering. The results indicate that the addition of Fe significantly increases the electron\u2013phonon interaction, which does not favor the moving of the charge carriers. So the resistivity enhances with the increasing Fe-doped level. The temperature dependence of the MR under applied field 5 T is presented in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that the MR of the sample with y = 0.10 is larger than y = 0 and y = 0.05 at the same fields and two pronounced peaks can also be observed. The higher temperature peak just occurs at about T C , indicating that it mainly originates from the intrinsic CMR, according to previous reports. [19,27] The physical origin of the MR effect in the high-temperature region has possibly been explained by the existence of magnetic polarons near the ferromagnetic transition temperature and their effect on the electron transport with and without an external field. Well below T C the manganese ions are ferromagnetical ordered. Inside a single magnetic domain the electron transfer between pairs of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions is easy. But for an unmagnetized specimen there exist many domains that have different magnetization directions. Near the domain-wall boundaries, the pairs of spins of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ may not be parallel. As a result the electron transfer between pairs of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions across the domain wall is difficult and the resistivity is high. In a strong enough field, the magnetic domains tend to align along the field direction. As a result electrons are transferred more easily across the domain-wall boundaries and resistivity decreases. Our samples under 5 T field, the canting angle will become smaller and therefore electrons will transfer more easily between pairs of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions. This will lead to a MR effect ( Fig. 6 ). It can be seen from Fig. 5 , the dependence of temperature becomes larger in high temperature region. The MR of the sample y = 0.1 drops rapidly with increasing temperature. In the high doping sample, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is lower than nondoped sample. So in the high temperature, thermal fluctuations induce to random potential. It is consistent with thermomagnetic curves. 4 Conclusions In summary, the polycrystalline La 5/6 Na 1/6 Mn 1\u2212 y Fe y O 3 ( y = 0, 0.05, 0.10) have been prepared by sol-gel technique. The structure, magnetic and transport properties are investigated. The results indicate that the structure of these compounds is orthorhombic, which proves the substitution with Fe has the advantage that it does not cause lattice distortion. However, the ferromagnetic ordering temperature and the saturation magnetization decrease with the addition of Fe. The thermomagnetic irreversibility arises from the magnetic anisotropy due to the difference in the way that FC and ZFC measurements are performed on polycrystalline samples. While the resistivity and the CMR increase with the increasing Fe content which strengthens the electron\u2013phonon interaction not favoring the move of the charge carriers. The effect of Fe is consistent with the depopulation of hopping electrons and weakening DE interaction, possibly due to the formation of magnetic cluster. In the samples with high doping level, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy is lower than underdoped sample. The high-field MR effect may have its origin in a small canting of the manganese moments inside each domain even for H > H s . References [1] L. Sheng D.Y. Xing D.N. Sheng C.S. Ting Phys. Rev.

In this paper, a glass system based on SiO2-B2O 3-Al2O3-Na2O-PbO2-ZnO was prepared and the contents were optimized to determine the best material named T24. The softening point and viscosity at high temperature calculated based on thermal expansion curve are 840 K and 105 Pa.s (at 1198 K), respectively. The optimum sealing temperature range is between 1138 and 1173 K. The particle size distribution curves of powders ball-milled for different time were measured by laser light scatter method. After sealing, T24 glass sealant adhered with YSZ electrolyte well and there were no perforative pores in the sealant. The open circuit voltage of single cell sealed with this sealant was near theoretical value.",

The results indicate that short-range ferromagnetic clusters coexist with the glassy magnetic state, i.e., a cluster-glass phase between Tf and T G and a spin-glass-like phase below Tf. The clear evidence of memory effects in the dc magnetization is also observed below Tf and TG, respectively.

XRD and SEM measurements show that the sintering after cold-high-pressure compacting is helpful to align the c-axis of layered grain within the sample along the pressing direction, i.e. the sample is highly textured. The thermoelectric properties of NaCo2O4, measured below room temperature exhibit a metallic behavior in both the resistivity p and Seebeck coefficient S. The sign of S is positive, indicating a p-type thermoelectric material.

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope were employed to show that the plate-like grains within the sample are aligned along the pressing direction. The resistivity \u03c1 and thermoelectric power S along the preferred {0 0 1} plane were measured in the whole temperature range from 15 to 973 K in air and the correlation between thermoelectric properties and texture was investigated. It was found that both \u03c1 and S exhibit metallic behavior in the whole temperature range and the above sample exhibits lower \u03c1 and higher S due to high texture and density. The power factor exhibits a steep rise above 400 K and reaches 761 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 at 973 K, suggesting a promising candidate for thermoelectric application at higher temperature. The change of slope in both resistivity and thermoelectric power curves at about 450 K might arise from the spin-state transition of Co ions in the CoO 2 blocks. Keywords Oxides High texture Thermoelectric properties 1 Introduction Thermoelectric materials have recently attracted a renewed interest as a promising energy-conversion material in harmony with our environments. The performance of a thermoelectric material is usually characterized by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S 2 T / \u03c1\u03ba , where S , \u03c1 , \u03ba are the thermoelectric power, resistivity, and thermal conductivity at the temperature T , respectively. Although the materials with the highest thermoelectric performance are intermetallic compounds at present [1\u20133] , their application to power generation systems have been limited because they are easily decomposed or oxidized at high temperature in air. With respect to the high-temperature operation in air, metal oxides have obvious advantages for their excellent thermal and chemical stability. In 1997, Terasaki et al. discovered that NaCo 2 O 4 single crystal, which is characterized by a CoO 2 triangular-lattice layer consisting of edge-shared CoO 6 octahedra, displays high thermoelectric power of 100 \u03bcV K \u22121 and low resistivity of 200 \u03bc\u03a9 cm at 300 K [4] , indicating a potential thermoelectric material. From then on, layered cobalt oxides, such as Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 [5\u20137] or Bi 2 Sr 2 Co 2 O y [8] , have been extensively investigated. However, the high cost and difficulty in mass-producing large single crystals limit their practical utilization in a device. An alternative way is to use polycrystalline materials and improve their thermoelectric performance by optimizing the preparation process. The transport properties of such cobalt oxides are highly anisotropy due to their layered structure [4\u20138] , suggesting that preferentially grain-aligned ceramics would exhibit higher thermoelectric performance than randomly oriented ceramics with the same composition. Recently, the correlation between thermoelectric properties and texture strength was demonstrated within the framework of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 textured ceramics based on an innovative method of X-ray diffraction analysis [9] . With the above guiding principle in mind, many attempts, such as the reactive templated grain growth method [10] , chemical solution process [11] and magnetic alignment technique [7] , have been made to prepare highly textured ceramics. In this paper, we develop a method of fabricating highly grain-aligned dense NaCo 2 O 4 ceramics by compacting the powder under a cold high-pressure before sintering. The compacting under high pressure can decrease the distance among the reagent particles and enhance the reactivity effectively. By considering the layered structure of NaCo 2 O 4 , the grains are expected to align along the pressing direction after compacting under a high pressure followed by solid-state reaction treatment. Meanwhile, the grain size and bulk density of the polycrystalline materials can be improved greatly due to the sufficient contact among the grains treated by cold high-pressure compacting technique. 2 Experimental NaCo 2 O 4 polycrystalline sample was prepared by compacting the powder under a cold high-pressure before sintering. As the raw materials, reagent grade Na 2 CO 3 and Co 2 O 3 powders in the stoichiometric ratio were mixed thoroughly. The mixture was cold pressed into pellets under a moderate pressure of 500 MPa, and then calcined in air at 1133 K for 10 h. The pellets were pulverized manually for 1h, and then the powders were cold pressed into dish-shaped pellets under a high pressure of 2 GPa with a special WC die. Finally, the above pellets were sintered in air at 1173 K for 10 h. Also, we added 20% excess Na 2 CO 3 during each calcination and sintering process since Na tends to evaporate during the heating process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Bede D 1 XRD diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 0.15406 nm) radiation. The microstructure was observed with a HITACHI S-4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The temperature dependences of resistivity and thermoelectric power from 15 to 300 K were measured by using the PPMS (Quantum Design). The resistivity from room temperature to 973 K was measured by means of a standard four-probe method using the 2400 SourceMeter (KEITHLEY). The thermoelectric power from 373 to 973 K was calculated from the thermoelectric voltage collected with 2000 Multimeter (KEITHLEY) and the temperature difference between the two ends of the sample. Due to different measurement conditions the values for low temperature and high temperature regions cannot change smoothly. In order to eliminate this, we keep the values at low temperature unchanged and extrapolate and/or scale a factor for the high temperature values of thermoelectric power and resistivity, respectively. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD pattern for the surface of the pellet processed by the cold high-pressure compacting before sintering, with comparison to (b) the crushed powder of the above specimen as well as (c) the pattern of \u03b3-NaCo 2 O 4 in the JCPDS card (No. 27-0682). Powder XRD pattern (b) confirmed that the sample was crystallized in single-phase and no impurity peaks were observable. Compared with the patterns of the crushed powder and JCPDS card, the XRD profile for the surface of the pellet exhibited strong diffraction peaks from {0 0 l} planes. The (1 0 2) and (1 0 4) diffraction peaks, which are the second strongest in the JCPDS card, were hardly observed for the cold high-pressure processed specimen. It is well known that single crystal NaCo 2 O 4 consists of Na layer and CoO 2 blocks alternatively stacking along the c -axis to form a layered structure [4] , suggesting a highly crystallographic anisotropy. The XRD pattern (a) indicated that the c axis of the grains within the sample was preferred to align along the pressing direction after compacting under 2 GPa and sintering treatment. When the specimen was pulverized, the diffraction peaks from other planes exhibited, but the relative intensity of the peaks for the powder XRD was still different from that of the JCPDS card. It means that the large crystallographic anisotropy of the grains still exists in the sample after pulverizing. Generally, the degree of crystallographic anisotropy of these materials is evaluated in terms of the Lotgering factor [12] , f = ( p \u2212 p 0 ) / ( 1 \u2212 p 0 ) , where p = \u2211 I ( 0 \u2009 0 \u2009 l ) / \u2211 I ( h \u2009 k \u2009 l ) , and p 0 = p for a crystallographic isotropic (randomly oriented) sample. In this study, p 0 was calculated from the peak data of the JCPDS card, No. 27-0682 as in Ref. [11] . When the c -axis directions of grains are completely aligned along the pressing direction, the f value is calculated to be 1. The Lotgering factor f values of the pellet and its powder were calculated to be 0.94 and 0.71, respectively, according to the integrated intensity of the diffraction peaks in their XRD profiles. The value of 0.71 is very close to 0.70 for the sample prepared with traditional solid-state reaction method alone [11] . The f value above 0.9 has been found in the samples prepared by the reactive templated grain growth method [10] and critic acid complex method [11] , respectively. The f value of 0.94 for our sample indicates that a polycrystalline sample with a large crystallographic anisotropy can be fabricated by adopting a cold high-pressure compacting process before sintering. Compared with those above-mentioned methods, this method is simple and can be applied to more systems. Fig. 2 shows the SEM photographs of the oriented NaCo 2 O 4 specimen for (a) perpendicular and (b) parallel section to the pressed plane of the pellet. From these photographs, we can know that (1) the sintered sample was dense which is helpful for reducing the resistivity; (2) most of the grains in Fig. 2 (a) exhibited a large flat area along the pressed plane; (3) most grains exhibited a plate-like shape and were preferentially aligned along the pressing direction as shown from (b), i.e. highly textured polycrystalline sample was fabricated by means of the cold high-pressure compacting technique; (4) the layered structure of the grains can be clearly observed from the inset of Fig. 2 (b). All of these features are consistent with the conclusions reached from the XRD profiles. Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity \u03c1 for the oriented NaCo 2 O 4 specimen. With increasing temperature the \u03c1 values monotonously increase from 2.25 \u03bc\u03a9 m at 15 K to 38.7 \u03bc\u03a9 m at 973 K, indicating a typical metallic behavior. As shown elsewhere, the transport properties of single crystal NaCo 2 O 4 exhibit high anisotropy due to its layered structure [4] ; i.e. the in-plane \u03c1 ab and out-of-plane \u03c1 c at 300 K are 2 and 70 \u03bc\u03a9 m, respectively. The \u03c1 value of 18.82 \u03bc\u03a9 m at 300 K in our sample is about 10 times higher than \u03c1 ab probably due to the charge carrier scattering by the grain boundaries in the polycrystalline sample. However, this value is much smaller than \u03c1 c of the single crystal. Thus, it can be concluded that the electrical conductivity of the highly textured NaCo 2 O 4 specimen arises mainly from the transfer of charge carriers in the CoO 2 blocks. In the whole temperature range, the above oriented specimen exhibits lower \u03c1 values compared with samples prepared with reactive templated grain growth method or solid-state reaction methods [10,13] . Such a reduction in the resistivity should attribute to the high texture and bulk density due to the high-pressure compacting, i.e. the alignment of the c -plane of each grain along the pressed plane as well as the decrease of grain boundaries reduce the charge carrier scattering. It was noticed that the resistivity exhibits a lower rise above 450 K as indicated by an arrow in Fig. 3 . Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power S for the NaCo 2 O 4 specimen. In the whole temperature range, S increases with increasing temperature, showing a metallic behavior as in the case of the resistivity. However, two changes of slope in the temperature dependence of S were observed. The rapid increase of S was first lowered at about 120 K, which was explained by the narrowing of the a 1 T band due to the c -axis thermal expansion [14] . From then on, the S increases almost linearly and reaches 172 \u03bcV K \u22121 at 973 K except a step rise at about 450 K. As mentioned above, the resistivity curve also exhibits a change of inclination at the same temperature. A change from a metallic behavior to an activated behavior in resistivity accompanied by a discontinuous change in the inverse magnetic susceptibility at 420 K has been observed in the misfit-layered Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 with the same CoO 2 blocks as NaCo 2 O 4 , and was attributed to the spin-state transition within the blocks [5] . It has been shown experimentally the spin state and the ratio of Co 3+ and Co 4+ ions in the CoO 2 blocks of NaCo 2 O 4 are the same with that of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 [15,16] . Thus, it is possible that the spin-state transition occurs in NaCo 2 O 4 from the LS Co 3+ ions or Co 4+ ions to IS or HS at about 450 K, while the carrier density or the density of states near E F would be changed simultaneously. If these changes occur, the thermoelectric power and resistivity might exhibit a change at the temperature of spin-state transition due to the strong correlation among them. The slope change in the resistivity and thermoelectric power of NaCo 2 O 4 rather than a significant transition from metal to semiconductor in Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 might arise from the difference between the single disordered Na layer in the former and the rock-salt type Ca 2 CoO 3 layer in the latter. The sign of the thermoelectric power is positive over the entire temperature range, indicating the major conductivity carriers are holes. The value of 172 \u03bcV K \u22121 at 973 K is relatively high comparing with samples prepared with other processes, for example, Tajima et al. have reported a value of about 120 \u03bcV K \u22121 at 973 K for the oriented NaCo 2 O 4 specimen prepared by reactive templated grain growth method [10] . Although the preferentially grain-alignment with the Lotgering factor above 0.9 has been achieved by both the reactive templated grain growth treatment and the cold high-pressure compacting process, the grain size in the latter case can be larger than those of the former due to the large compacting pressure. This might be the cause of the relative high thermoelectric power. Power factor P of the oriented NaCo 2 O 4 specimen was calculated from the thermoelectric power S and resistivity \u03c1 in the equation P = S 2 / \u03c1 . Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of the power factor of the sample. After rapid increase from low temperature, P reaches a temperature-independent value of about 360 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 between 100 and 400 K. From then on, P increases steeply with increasing temperature again and reaches 761 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 at 973 K, which is relatively high due to the high thermoelectric power and low resistivity. Such a temperature dependence of P suggests that the layered cobalt oxides are promising candidate for thermoelectric application at high temperature. Furthermore, we can reach the conclusion that the thermoelectric properties of the layered cobalt oxides can be optimized through improving the texture strength and bulk density by means of the cold high-pressure compacting technique. 4 Conclusion Highly textured NaCo 2 O 4 polycrystalline sample was fabricated using the cold high-pressure compacting technique and its thermoelectric properties were evaluated in the temperature range from 15 to 973 K. The relationship between the grain-alignment and thermoelectric properties was manifested; i.e., the conductivity and thermoelectric power are effectively enhanced due to the high texture and bulk density. The power factor that reaches 761 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 at 973 K exhibits a rapid increase at high temperature, indicating the potential for high-temperature thermoelectric application. Thus, the thermoelectric properties of the layered cobalt oxides can be optimized through improving the texture strength and bulk density by means of the cold high-pressure compacting technique.

Non contact concrete shrinkage measuring apparatus and plate type concrete cracking frame were adopted in this experiment.

Results show that the mechanism of sodium sulfate in pore with different pore sizes on autogenous shrinkage and cracking of fresh concrete are not uniform. Effect of sodium sulfate on shrinkage of concrete at early age correlates with the dosages of sodium sulfate as well as water/blender ratios. In the case of same sodium sulfate dosages, when the water/blender ratio is smaller the value of shrinkage at early age is bigger; while in the case of same water/blender ratio when the dosage of sodium sulfate is larger the shrinkage is smaller. Influence of sodium sulfate on the cracking of concrete correlate with different curing styles. Cracks at the surface of concretes cured in the air environments occurred earlier, wider and more than that cured in a sealed environment. Under this two curing styles the initial depth of crystals of sodium sulfate depends on the different rates of water evaporation, which is the main effect mechanism of sodium sulfate on cracking of concrete.",

        "abstract": "Polycrystalline Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.3) samples were prepared by solid-state reaction method and the thermoelectric properties were studied from 300 up to 1000 K. With the substitution of Ag + for Ca 2+ , the resistivity decreased while thermoelectric power increased simultaneously, and the thermal conductivity was found to decrease monotonically with increasing Ag content. These results indicated that the thermoelectric performance of the Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 system could be optimized remarkably with the substitution of Ag. The power factor would reach 700 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 and the figure of merit ZT could exceed 0.3 at 1000 K for the x = 0.3 sample, suggesting a promising thermoelectric oxide candidate at high temperatures. Keywords Layered cobaltite Substitution Thermoelectric properties 1 Introduction Thermoelectric materials have attracted a renewed interest as a clean energy-conversion system in harmony with our environment. In recent years, the layered cobalt oxides have been investigated extensively since single-crystal NaCo 2 O 4 was found to exhibit a large thermoelectric power ( S ) simultaneously accompanied by low resistivity ( \u03c1 ) and low thermal conductivity ( \u03ba ) [1] . In this family, the misfit-layered Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 , which also shows high thermoelectric performance, has attracted a considerable attention due to its thermal and chemical stabilities at high temperature in air [2\u20138] . Many experimental investigations have been carried out in order to understand and optimize the thermoelectric properties of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 [4,8\u201310] . Theoretical treatment of cobalt oxides indicated that the average valence of cobalt is an important factor determining their thermoelectric properties [9] , so the adjustment of the average valence of cobalt and thus the carrier concentration by doping is a feasible route to optimizing the thermoelectric performance [11\u201313] . For practical thermoelectric materials, a large thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT= S 2 T / \u03c1\u03ba ) is necessary, which requires a large S , a small \u03c1 and \u03ba . These three parameters are all the function of carrier concentration and interrelated to each other. Generally speaking, a decrease in \u03c1 ordinarily results in decreasing S and a decrease in \u03ba usually leads to an increase in \u03c1 . However, it is quite interesting that univalent Na + substitution for Ca 2+ was found to reduce \u03c1 and increase S simultaneously, resulting in the remarkable enhancement of power factor P ( =S 2 / \u03c1 ) [11] . So appropriate doping would improve the thermoelectric performance of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 system and enhance the ZT value [8,12\u201314] . But as a light element, the substitution of Na leaded to the increase in \u03ba , which is unfavorable for the increase of the ZT value. Therefore, doping Ca 2+ with a heavy ion, such as univalent Ag + , may reduce \u03ba but maintain the decrease in \u03c1 and the increase in S , so that the ZT value can be enhanced evidently. In this paper, we synthesized the polycrystalline Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.3) samples and systematically investigated their thermoelectric properties at high temperature up to 1000 K. We found that the thermoelectric performance of the Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 system can be improved remarkably with the substitution of Ag for Ca. 2 Experimental details The Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 polycrystalline samples ( x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.3) were prepared by solid-state reaction method. Reagent grade CaCO 3 , Co 2 O 3 and AgNO 3 powders in the stoichiometric ratio were mixed thoroughly and calcined in air at 1173 K for 12 h. Then the mixture was reground, pressed into disc-shaped pellet under 450 MPa and sintered at 1223 K for 36 h under an O 2 flow with an intermediate grinding. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data at room temperature were collected using a Bede D 1 XRD diffractometer with Ni filtered Cu K\u03b1 ( \u03bb = 0.15406 nm) radiation. The morphology of samples was observed with a HITACHI S-4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The resistivity from room temperature to 1073 K was measured by means of a standard four-probe method using the 2400 SourceMeter (KEITHLEY). TG measurement was carried out by using the SDT-2920 (TA). The thermoelectric power from 373 to 973 K was calculated from the thermoelectric voltage collected with 2000 Multimeter (KEITHLEY) and the temperature difference between the two ends of the sample. The thermal conductivity at 300 K was measured by using the PPMS (Quantum Design). 3 Results and discussion The XRD patterns for the pressed surface of Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 ( x = 0, 0.3) ceramics and the crushed powder of Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 ( x = 0.3) are shown in Fig. 1 , which are identical to the standard JCPDS card (21\u2013139) of Ca 9 Co 12 O 28 , indicating the formation of single-phase compounds at room temperature. The XRD patterns for other compositions (not shown here) are the same as the above specimens, indicating that Ag was doped into the lattice of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 without obvious change in the crystal structure. The lattice parameters were determined by Rietveld refinement method based on the X-ray powder diffraction, using the profile analysis program FULLPROF. It can be found from Table 1 that the lattice parameters a and b 1 decrease simultaneously, but c increases strikingly with increasing doping content, resulting in a quite large crystallographic distortion. The ionic radii of Ag + and Ca 2+ in six-coordination are 1.15 and 1.00 \u00c5, respectively [15] . Because Ag + is larger and heavier than Ca 2+ , both of the unit-cell volume and the values of bulk density of samples increase with the increase of doping level (shown in Table 1 ). It should be noted that the XRD profiles for the pressed surface of all the samples exhibit strong diffraction peaks from (0 0 l ) planes, but other diffraction peaks are quite weak, indicating the formation of textured structure in these polycrystalline samples. The SEM image of the specimen for parallel section to the pressed plane shows that most of the grains exhibit a plate-like shape and are preferentially aligned along the pressing direction, i.e. the high quality polycrystalline samples with a large crystallographic anisotropy were fabricated. When the specimen was pulverized, the diffraction peaks from other planes exhibited, but the relative intensity of the peaks was still weaker than that of the JCPDS card, which suggests that this strong textured structure in the grains was remained partly even after the specimen was pulverized, as shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity ( \u03c1 ) of Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 in the range from 300 to 1073 K. All the samples show similar transport behavior, metallic-like behavior below about 380 K and semiconducting-like behavior above about 380 K. The resistivity decreases significantly with increasing Ag content, and down to 7.5 m\u03a9 cm at 1000 K for the x = 0.3 sample. The carrier of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 is hole [2] , so the decrease of \u03c1 could be attributed to the substitution of univalent Ag + for divalent Ca 2+ , which enhances the hole concentration of the system. The plots of ln( \u03c3T ) versus 1/ T for all the samples lie on straight lines above 600 K, as shown in Fig. 3 , indicating hopping conduction at high temperature [13,16,17] . The activation energy ( E a ) obtained from the slopes of the plots [16] are almost the same for all the samples, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 , which indicates that the Ag + substitution for Ca 2+ does not change both the E a of the hopping process and then the transport mechanism. Actually, in layered Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 oxide, the CoO 2 layer is responsible for the electric conduction [2,6] . Ag was doped in the Ca 2 CoO 3 layer, and the conduction path would not be disturbed, and so the E a will keep constant. It can be found from Fig. 4 that for all the samples, there is an obvious M\u2013I transition around 380 K, where the resistivity decreases dramatically. Ag substitution only reduces the transition temperature ( T M\u2013I ) slightly, but does not change the intensity and shape of the \u03c1 peak. In the CoO 2 sheets of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 , the threefold-degenerate t 2 orbitals will be split into a non-degenerated a 1 T orbital directed along the c axis and doubly degenerated e T orbitals directed toward neighboring cobalt atoms within the CoO 2 plane due to the rhombohedral distortion of the octahedron. The e T orbitals are broadened into a narrow band of itinerant-electron states by Co\u2013Co interactions within the CoO 2 plane [18] . We suggested that the M\u2013I transition here maybe a first order structure transition, caused by a discontinuous increase of the mean equilibrium Co\u2013O bond length. With increasing temperature, the thermal expansion of the Co\u2013Co separation will narrow the e T band to an e T orbital of localized electron state, and result in a M\u2013I transition consequently. With Ag + substitution for Ca 2+ , because of the crystallographic distortion caused by the difference between Ag + and Ca 2+ ionic radii, the e T energy band will be narrowed and the Co\u2013Co interactions will decrease, so the e T band will approach the narrow-band limit for itinerant electron behavior at lower temperature. Therefore, the decrease of T M\u2013I with increasing doping level can be anticipated. It can be found that for the samples of x = 0\u20130.15, the \u03c1 \u2013 T curves are quite flat above 800 K. The volatilization of oxygen from crystal lattice may be responsible for such transition, because TG experiments show the obvious loss of weight of these samples above 800 K ( Fig. 5 ). But for the x = 0.3 sample, the loss of weight is quite slight (less than 0.3% at 1150 K), and the \u03c1 decreases more rapidly at high temperature. So we can see that increasing Ag doping level could restrain volatilization of oxygen, and the retainability of oxygen content would enhance the hopping mobility of carriers through a little change of Co 3+ /Co 4+ ratio [19] , which results in the decrease of \u03c1 continuous with the increase of temperature. The temperature dependence of thermoelectric power ( S ) of Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 is shown in Fig. 6 . The positive S of all the samples indicates hole conduction in this compound, and the value of S increases with increasing temperature over the measured temperature range. It is quite interesting that S increases with increasing Ag content, similar to the results found in the Na substituted Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 system and Ag substituted NaCo 2 O 4 system [11,20] . Such phenomena cannot be explained reasonably by classical theory, and should be caused by strongly correlated properties of electron. However, the carrier mobility \u03bc ( \u025b ) may also play a crucial role in determining S in such layered cobalt oxides. According to Refs. [11,21,22] thermoelectric power can turn out to be expressed by formula: S ( T ) = c e n + \u03c0 2 k B 2 T 3 e \u2202 \u2009 ln \u2009 \u03bc ( \u03b5 ) \u2202 \u03b5 \u03b5 = \u03b5 F where n , \u03bc ( \u025b ), c e , k B , \u03c8 ( \u025b ) are carrier concentration, energy correlated carrier mobility, specific heat, Boltzmann constant and density of state, respectively. The formula consists of two terms and the value of first term c e / n is inverse of carrier concentration, but the increase of S with the increase of carrier concentration for Ag substituted samples suggests that the second term should be dominated in describing the S of these samples. We could presume that \u03bc ( \u025b ) has been actually changed by doping Ag, which is the same as Na substituted Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 system [11] , and just the change of \u03bc ( \u025b ) results in the increase of S. Further studies should be carried out in order to clarify the nature of S in such layered cobalt oxides. The change of \u03c1 and S with doping level indicates that thermoelectric performance of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 system can be improved effectively by Ag substitution. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of P of Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 samples, which were calculated from the measured S and \u03c1 in the equation P = S 2 / \u03c1 . For all samples, the value of P enhanced with increasing temperature and Ag substitution results in the increase of P . Due to the considerable reduction of resistivity and high thermoelectric power, the value of P reaches 700 \u03bcW m \u22121 K \u22122 at 973 K for the x = 0.3 sample, which is nearly three times larger than the undoped sample and quite large for the Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 ceramic. Fig. 8 displays that the value of \u03ba for Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 decreases monotonously with the increase of Ag content, which accords with the conclusion that substitution by heavy element leads to the reduction of \u03ba . In addition, with increasing doping level, the scattering of lattice defect and impurity increase, which shorten the average free path of phonon and result the decrease of the thermal conductivity [23\u201325] . Generally speaking, for most crystal insulator the thermal conductivity will descend at high temperature. Actually, for nearly all the doped Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 ceramic system the \u03ba decreases with increasing temperature from room temperature to high temperature or keep nearly constant [8,11\u201313] . In this case, we could suppose that the \u03ba of Ag-doped Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 ceramic at 1000 K would not be higher than that at 300 K. Thus, we calculated the figure of merit ZT (= S 2 T / \u03c1\u03ba ) of Ca 3\u2212 x Ag x Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 by using \u03ba at 300 K. From Fig. 8 , the ZT for the x = 0.3 sample could exceed 0.3 at 1000 K and is much larger than that of the undoped sample. 4 Conclusion Substituting Ag for Ca in Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 ceramics provides a significant decrease of \u03c1 and increase of S simultaneously due to the enhancement of the carrier concentration and the change of \u03bc ( \u025b ), which result in the increase of power factor P observably. At the same time, the Ag + doping could be advantageous for reducing the \u03ba , so the figure of merit ZT value can be enhanced remarkably. These results suggest that Ag-substituted Ca 3 Co 4 O 9+ \u03b4 may be potential thermoelectric material for application at high temperature.

The degree of the cation ordering of Sr2FeMoO6 increases with Al doping obviously as shown by the refinement of room-temperature X-ray diffraction. The saturated magnetic moment per formula unit of these compounds decreases gradually with increasing Al concentration, but the magnetic moment per Fe ion increases markedly, which is consistent with the improvement of cation ordering. Basing on the analysis of magnetic structure with Al doping, doping of Al will lead to the formation of non-magnetic coupled Mo-O-Al-O-Mo chains, which can divide the large Mo-O-Fe ferrimagnetic region into smaller patches and enhance the low field magnetoresistance. The formation of Fe-O-Fe antiphase boundaries are suppressed by the doping Al due to the improvement of the cation ordering, and the high field magnetoresistance that roots in spin-dependent scattering at the antiphase boundaries is reduced. Therefore, the total magnetoresistance reaches a maximum value at x = 0.15.",

        "abstract": "PrGaO 3 -based perovskite oxides were synthesized using a standard solid state technique. In the formula Pr 1\u2212 x M x Ga 1\u2212 y Mg y O 3 (M=Ca, Sr), the solid solution limit is x =0.1 for Ca/Sr doped at A sites and y =0.2 for Mg doped at B sites. The oxygen ion conductivity increases and the activation energy decreases with increasing dopant concentration at A sites or B sites by single doping. However, the conductivity decreases when both A and B sites are doped, compared with single doping only. Mg-doped samples have superior properties, i.e. PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 has a maximum conductivity of 0.05 S/cm at 800\u00b0C, while PrGa 0.8 Mg 0.2 O 3 has a minimum activation energy of 24.19 kJ/mol in all the samples. With increasing temperature, the oxygen ion transport number of the samples increases. The conductivity of these samples is mainly ionic although hole conduction was observed. A power density of 0.131 W/cm 2 and a short circuit current density of 0.45 A/cm 2 were obtained at 940\u00b0C in the fuel cell experiment by using PrGa 0.9 Mg 0.1 O 3 as an electrolyte.",

The crystal structure of Sr2 FeMoO6 does not change by adding glass, and the glass is most likely located at the grain boundaries. The low field magnetoresistance up to 1 T of Sr2 FeMoO6 -glass composites at 10 K all shows obvious butterfly-shaped field dependence other than the pure Sr2 FeMoO6 bulk sample. The magnetoresistance of Sr2 FeMoO6 -glass composites at 10 K is enhanced gradually with increasing the glass concentration and reaches 39% with a wt % of 50%. The enhancement of low field magnetoresistance in Sr2 FeMoO6 -glass composites can be well explained by the spin-dependent tunneling at the glass boundaries, and it also allowed us to conclude that the spin polarization of Sr2 FeMoO6 is at least 80% at low temperature. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics.",

A window of milling time, a mechanical collision-induced intermediate phase of \u03b1-quartz and its condition of easily crystallizing into coesite under the condition of 3.0 GPa, 923 K, < 1.0 min have been discovered. The new method needs much shorter synthesizing time and lower synthesizing critical pressure than those used before. The Raman spectra for the coesite synthesized by the present method have covered all the information of those natural and synthesized coesites reported before. It is demonstrated that this method has a great potential in geo-science research and implied the other possible mechanism of coesite formation in the Earth's crust.",

XRD patterns and SEM images show that the structure and the grain size of these compounds were not changed and no impurity was observed by doping with Al in Sr2 FeMoO6. In the cationic ordered segregation, a large ferrimagnetic patch can be separated into some smaller ones by the Al doping. So the chain of the ferrimagnetic exchange path will be shortened and the strength of exchange will be weakened. Therefore, their moments become more sensitive to external field. Furthermore, when the Al ion replaces the Fe ion in the disordered segregation, the antiferromagnetic coupling becomes weaker. As a result, the low-field magnetoresistance is enhanced. But the smaller ferrimagnetic segregates become more sensitive to thermal agitation at high temperatures. The weakness of the Al-doped SFMO lies in its stronger temperature dependence of the saturated moments and the low-field magnetoresistance.",

X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope were employed to show that the plate-like grains within the sample are aligned along the pressing direction. The resistivity \u03c1 and thermoelectric power S along the preferred {0 0 1} plane were measured in the whole temperature range from 15 to 973 K in air and the correlation between thermoelectric properties and texture was investigated. It was found that both \u03c1 and S exhibit metallic behavior in the whole temperature range and the above sample exhibits lower \u03c1 and higher S due to high texture and density. The power factor exhibits a steep rise above 400 K and reaches 761 \u03bcW m-1 K-2 at 973 K, suggesting a promising candidate for thermoelectric application at higher temperature. The change of slope in both resistivity and thermoelectric power curves at about 450 K might arise from the spin-state transition of Co ions in the CoO2 blocks. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Recently, a fabricated two-dimensional (2D) Bi2Te3 single quintuple layer (BiTe-1QL) has demonstrated great potential in the application of electronics. However, detailed research of the deformation effect on this material is still lacking. In this paper, the deformation effects on the crystal lattice and electronic band structure of BiTe-1QL were studied by first-principle methods. It was found that tensile and compressive deformations in the x- or y-direction on BiTe-1QL caused both the movements of Bi and Te1 atomic layers along the x-direction, which can be explained by minimizing the deformation-introduced symmetry breaking. The position of the valence-band maximum of BiTe-1QL experienced a shift among critical points near the band edge with the applied strain. Moreover, \u22128% deformation in the x-direction causes the BiTe-1QL be a direct-bandgap semiconductor. The theoretical investigations clarify the structural and electronic properties of quasi-2D BiTe-1QL, and pave the way for its potential application in electronics.",

The magnetism in two-dimensional TMDCs broadens their applications in spintronic and multi-functional devices. Herein, by combining macro/micro-magnetic experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that among five possible edge-terminated WSe nanosheets only two types have a magnetic ground state, corresponding to the 100% Se edge terminated and 50% Se edge terminated nanosheets, respectively. The calculation results on WSe clusters and WSe zig-zag nanoribbons with different terminations and Se coverage rate confirmed that the unpaired electrons of the edge atoms play a crucial role in the appearance of ferromagnetism in WSe nanosheets. Furthermore, due to the possible quantum confinement effect and surface effect, there exist thickness-dependent magnetic properties, and the magnitude of magnetism at the edge increases as the number of layers decreases.",

In this paper, we report CP in (Al\u2009+\u2009Nb) co-doped rutile SnO2 ceramics with a low dielectric loss at room temperature. Al0.02Nb0.05Sn0.93O2 and Al0.03Nb0.05Sn0.92O2 ceramics exhibit high relative dielectric permittivities (above 103) and low dielectric losses (0.015\u2009u003c\u2009tan \u03b4\u2009u003c\u20090.1) in a wide range of frequencies and at temperatures from 140 to 400\u2009K. Al doping can effectively modulate the dielectric behavior by increasing the grain and grain boundary resistances. The large differences in the resistance and conductive activation energy of the grains and grain boundaries suggest that the CP in co-doped SnO2 ceramics can be attributed to the internal barrier layer capacitor effect.",

The temperature dependence of resistance and non-linear I\u2013V curve at room temperature suggest that the measured resistance is strongly influenced by the applied voltage and/or the current. The MR was observed to be dependent upon both the applied voltage and the angle between the magnetic field and the current. A greatly magnified low field negative MR\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22124% was achieved at 300\u00a0K and 500\u00a0Oe up to 3.0\u00a0V in the Fe 3 O 4 /Si structure, which originated from the release of charge accumulation at the Fe 3 O 4 /Si interface under the applied magnetic field due to the negative MR of Fe 3 O 4 .",

        "abstract": "Defects play a significant role in optical properties of semiconducting two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In ultra-thin MoSe2, a remarkable feature at ~250 cm-1 in Raman spectra is ascribed to be a defect-related mode. Recent attempts failed to explain the origin of this peak, leaving it being a mystery. Here in this work, we demonstrate that this peak is a Se vacancy induced defect mode. Heat effect and hydrogen etching are two main factors to introduce Se vacancies in CVD process of growing MoSe2. A phonon confinement model can well explain the behaviors of intrinsic Raman modes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that single Se vacancy (VSe) is responsible for the appearance of Raman peak at ~250 cm-1 and this mode is an A1g-like localized mode which is also confirmed by polarized Raman scattering experiment. The relative strength of this mode can be a characterization of the quality of 2D MoSe2. This work may offer a simple method to tailor chalcogenide vacancies in 2D TMDCs and provide a way to study their vibrational properties.",

        "abstract": "Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), as direct bandgap semiconductors, show promise for applications in ultra-thin flexible optoelectronic devices. However, the optical properties and device performance are greatly affected by defects, such as vacancies, present in these materials. Vacancies exist unavoidably in mechanically exfoliated or grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) monolayer TMDCs; therefore, their influence on the electric and optical properties of host materials has been widely studied. Here, we report a new defect state located at 1.54 eV, which is 70 meV lower than the neutral exciton energy in as-prepared MoS2 monolayers grown by CVD. This defect state is clearly observed in photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectra at ambient conditions. PL mapping, Raman mapping, and atomic force microscopy analysis indicate a solid-vapor reaction growth mechanism of the defect state formation. During a certain growth stage, nuclei with the composition of WOxSey do not fully react with the Se vapor, leading to the defect formation. This type of defects permits radiative recombination of bound neutral excitons, which can make the PL intensity as strong as the intrinsic excitation. Our findings reveal a new way to tailor the optical properties of two-dimensional TMDCs without any additional processes performed after growth.",

        "abstract": "The search for colossal permittivity (CP) materials continues to attract considerable interest motivated by not only academic research but also potential applications. Very recently, CP with low dielectric loss was reported in In + Nb co-doped rutile TiO2 polycrystalline ceramics. However, the mechanism of CP in this material system and the effect of doping ions are still unclear. Here, we investigated the dielectric properties of AlxNb0.03Ti0.97\u2212xO2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) ceramics. CP with low dielectric loss was found in AlxNb0.03Ti0.97\u2212xO2 samples (x \u2264 0.03). Once the amount of Al-doping exceeds Nb, the CP disappears. The change in dielectric response with varying Al-doping concentration and Ti3+ concentration together with the conductive activation energy in AlxNb0.03Ti0.97\u2212xO2 ceramics clearly suggest that the CP mechanism in co-doped TiO2 ceramics could be attributed to the internal barrier layer capacitor effect. We believe that our research provides comprehensive guidance for the development of CP materials.",

The cylindrical configuration is applied to better illustrate the effects of the static magnetic field, considering the azimuthal motion of the dusts. The nonlinear evolution of the dust void and the rotation of the dust particles are then investigated numerically. The results show that, similar to the unmagnetized one-dimensional model, the radial ion drag plays a crucial role in the evolution of the void. Moreover, the dust rotation is driven by the azimuthal ion drag force exerting on the dust. As the azimuthal component of ion velocity increases linearly with the strength of the magnetic field, the azimuthal component of dust velocity increases synchronously. Moreover, the angular velocity gradients of the dust rotation show a sheared dust flow around the void.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper, we combine first principles calculations and experiments to investigate the influence of Ga-doping and oxygen vacancies on the magnetic properties of rutile TiO 2  films. Ga-doped TiO 2  with few oxygen vacancies exhibits ferromagnetism at room temperature with a  T  C  near 350\u00a0K, which can be explained using a modified magnetic polaron model. The number of Ti 3+  ions increases with increasing the oxygen vacancies concentration, which results in a larger magnetic moment along with a higher  T  C  in TiO 2\u2212\u03b4  film with the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling. The saturation magnetic moment is enhanced in Ga-doped TiO 2\u2212\u03b4  due to the absence of antiferromagnetic coupling after Ga-doping. More electrons occupy nearby Ti sites giving rise to the Ti 3+  moments. Our theoretical calculations suggest that the modified magnetic polaron model works well for the ferromagnetism of doped and undoped-TiO 2\u2212\u03b4 . Experimental results clearly show that the  T  C  is related to the oxygen vacancies concentration, which is a verification of the polaron percolation theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to present the authors' analysis of the water resource evolutional trend and study of the mechanism of the water resource system in hoping to be able to predict the future scenario by grey system theory.The results of our analysis show that,for the time being,the surface precipitation has been decreased under the global climate change.Currently,water resource system in Hebei has been disturbed by the over activity of human beings.Statistically speaking,annual exploitation quantity of the groundwater,in Hebei province only,has increased from 128.08 billion m3 in 1991 to 176.12 billion m3 in 2000,thus making the water resource development and utilization situation ever more serious.In addition,the quality of groundwater and surface water has been deteriorated since 1980,with the degree of mineralization and hardness of groundwater remarkably rising,which has brought about the phenomenon of dycarbonate-type and sulfate-type groundwater.Shallow beneath-surface water has become ever-going deepened from 1986 to 2000.The prediction of gray system shows that,the precipitation of the ground level of Hebei would have decreased in the near future to some extent.In spite of this,the exploitation quantity of groundwater would be increasing continuously,adding great pressure to the current fragile groundwater supplying system.On the other hand,water supply for agricultural irrigation would have to cut down due to the great pressure of human consumption just for living-making.Facing such a severe challenge,it would be inevitable for groundwater to increase its mineralization and hardness with the coming-up of bicarbonate-type and sulfate-type groundwater.It is no doubt that the buried depth of superficial water would get ever more deepened with time going on,which will have reached 19.92 meters by 2010 with the current annual average exploitation quantity increasing to 187.78 m3 in 2010.",

The spatial heterogeneity of groundwater level caused by its authigenic factors was big and, as an anisotropic result of groundwater level, it was found that there was a significant level difference in the period 1986-1990. The spatial distribution mapping of groundwater level by Kriging interpolation with the data of groundwater level in 1986-1990 and 1996-2000 showed that the trend of spatial distribution as a whole is that the groundwater level becomes high gradually from east to west and from the littoral plain to the piedmont plain, and the groundwater in the west middle plain is deeper than in the littoral plain. In conclusion, on the whole, there was a drawdown in the period from 1986 to 2000 because of such influencing factors as population, irrigation area, rainfall and run-off, which affects seriously the sustainable economic development of Hebei Province.",

But the continual reduction of groundwater has great impact on the regional sustainable utilization of water resources and the development of agriculture. This paper studied the spatial structure and variation characteristics of 5 factors of groundwater, such as chloride ion (CI), groundwater level (GL), nitrate nitrogen (NN), sulfate (S) and total hardness (TH), by the geostatistics method on the platform of GIS. The results showed that, (1) the spatial heterogeneity of nitrate nitrogen (NN) is mainly in small scale and of groundwater level (GL) are mainly in large scale. The spatial heterogeneity of other three factors is both reflected in small and large scale, (2) From the point of spatial distribution of groundwater level, the groundwater level is deepened from east to west, from the coastal plain to the piedmont plain and three great funnels of groundwater level were formed around the Shijiazhuang city, Xingtai city and Hand an city, (3) From the point of spatial distribution of groundwater quality, the high-value areas of chloride ion, sulfate and total hardness is distributed in the eastern and central, low-value distributed in the west. But the distribution of nitrate nitrogen is opposite, (4) in total, the distribution characteristics of the five groundwater indices were greatly impacted by the human activities. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

The land use information was acquired by interpreting the TM image data of 1993, 2000 and 2008, and 6 landscape indices (the proportion of all patches (PP), average patch area (APA), average patch perimeter (APP), average perimeter-area ration (APAR), fractal dimension (FD) and aggregation index (AI)) were adopted to characterize the spatial pattern of landscape during these three periods. The transition matrix was used to analyze the varying characteristics of all landscape types. The result showed that, natural and semi-natural landscape types, such as forest, grass and water body, decreased, so did agriculture land, however, the dry-land increased because of the decreasing irrigated land. The increased land for construction because of the human's activities, such as construction of cities and roads, is shown to be the main driving force for the changing landscape pattern.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing measurement with field spectrometer was carried to acquire the reflectance hyper-spectral data of the case II waters in the Yangtze River estuary. At the meantime, the surface water samples at depth of 0.5 m were bottled for suspended sediment concentration measurement and analyzed in laboratory. The current velocity was also measured synchronically with the spectral measurement. It was found that the reflectance amplitudes vary with the suspended sediment concentration. Two peaks exist in yellow-green (560-720 nm) band and near-infrared band (810 nm) respectively. At wave length above 650 nm a strong correlation exists between spectral reflectance and suspended sediment concentration. In the interval of wave length from 690 nm to 900 nm the reflectance is sensitive to variation of sediment concentration with correlation coefficient higher than 0.75. Based on the least-square method, the exponential relationship between spectral reflectance and sediment concentration as well as the power function relationship between spectral reflectance ratio and sediment are established. It is found that the exponential relationship for wave length at 670 nm and 715 nm has higher correlation coefficient. But the quadratic polynomial relationship for spectral reflectance ratio at wave length at 810 nm and 690 nm has better accuracy for estimation of sediment concentration.",

They are reflectance inversion methods based on ground spectral measurement against SSC,methods based on atmospheric corrections,and atmospheric propagation model based SSC modeling methods,respectively.(2) The ground reflectance inversion methods for SSC are of a combination of theory and experience,which are employed intensively.The empirical mathematic expressions between reflectance and SSC are in one of the forms of linear,logarithmic,negative exponential,Gordon relation or combinations of previous forms.(3)Available SSC models so far are not satisfied due to their incomparable accuracy to the SSC measured from in situ bottled samples.The authors believe that hydrological spectra study should be strengthened in order to establish a SSC model relating to multiple spectra.The trend for SSC inversion with remote sensed data is the application of fused images with both high spatial and spectral resolution.",

        "abstract": "Whole-colon water exchange (WWE) reduces insertion pain, increases cecal intubation success and adenoma detection rate, but requires longer insertion time, compared to air insufflation (AI) colonoscopy. We hypothesized that water exchange limited to the left colon (LWE) can speed up insertion with equivalent results.This prospective, randomized controlled study (NCT01735266) allocated patients (18-80 years) to WWE, LWE or AI group (1:1:1). The primary outcome was cecal intubation time.Three hundred subjects were randomized to the WWE (n = 100), LWE (n = 100) or AI group (n = 100). Ninety-four to ninety-five per cent of patients underwent diagnostic colonoscopy. Baseline characteristics were balanced. The median insertion time was shorter in LWE group (4.8 min (95%CI: 3.2-6.2)) than those in WWE (7.5 min (95%CI: 6.0-10.3)) and AI (6.4 min (95%CI: 4.2-9.8)) (both p < 0.001) groups. The cecal intubation rates in unsedated patients of the two water exchange methods (WWE 99%, LWE 99%) were significantly higher than that (89.8%) in AI group (p = 0.01). The final success rates were comparable among the three groups after sedation was given. Maximum pain scores and number of patients needing abdominal compression between WWE and LWE groups were comparable, both lower than those in AI group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed regarding PDR, although the PDR in right colon tended to be higher in WWE group.By preserving the benefits of WWE and reducing insertion time, LWE is appropriate for diagnostic colonoscopy, especially in settings with tight scheduling of patients. The higher PDR in the right colon in WWE group deserves to be further investigated.",

Herein we demonstrate that genistein will inhibit human CRC cell invasion and migration, that it does so at non-cytotoxic concentrations and we demonstrate this in multiple human CRC cell lines. After orthotopic implantation of human CRC tumors into mice, oral genistein did not inhibit tumor growth, but did inhibit distant metastasis formation, and was non-toxic to mice. Using a qPCR array, we screened for genistein-induced changes in gene expression, followed by Western blot confirmation, demonstrating that genistein downregulated matrix metalloproteinase 2 and Fms-Related Tyrosine Kinase 4 (FLT4; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3). After demonstrating that genistein suppressed neo-angiogenesis in mouse tumors, we examined FLT4 expression in primary CRC and adjacent normal colonic tissue from 60 human subjects, demonstrating that increased FLT4 significantly correlates with increased stage and decreased survival. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that genistein inhibits human CRC metastasis at dietary, non-toxic, doses. FLT4 is identified as a marker of metastatic disease, and as a response marker for small molecule therapeutics that inhibit CRC metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Colonoscopy is widely used for management of colorectal diseases. A history of abdominal or pelvic surgery is a well-recognized factor associated with difficult colonoscopy. Although water exchange colonoscopy (WEC) was effective in small groups of male U.S. veterans with such a history, its application in other cultural settings is uncertain.To investigate the application of WEC in such patients.Prospective, randomized, controlled, patient-blinded study.Tertiary-care referral center in China.Outpatients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery undergoing unsedated diagnostic, screening, or surveillance colonoscopy.Patients were randomized to examination by either WEC or conventional air colonoscopy (AC).Cecal intubation rate.A total of 110 patients were randomized to the WEC (n = 55) or AC (n = 55) group. WEC significantly increased the cecal intubation rate (92.7% vs 76.4%; P = .033). The maximum pain scores (\u00b1 standard deviation) were 2.1 \u00b1 1.8 (WEC) and 4.6 \u00b1 1.7 (AC), respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that the colonoscopy method was the only independent predictor of failed colonoscopy (odds ratio 11.44, 95% confidence interval, 1.35-97.09). A higher proportion of patients examined by WEC would be willing to have a repeat unsedated colonoscopy (90.9% vs 72.7%, P = .013).Single center; unblinded but experienced endoscopists.This randomized, controlled trial confirms that the water exchange method significantly enhanced cecal intubation in potentially difficult colonoscopy in unsedated patients with prior abdominal or pelvic surgery. The lower pain scores and higher proportion accepting repeat of the unsedated option suggest that WEC is promising. It may enhances compliance with colonoscopy in specific populations.

        "abstract": "Background and study aim: The allocation of sufficient time for trainees to attempt cannulation is necessary for learning and to ensure success with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) training. However, it is important to balance the benefit to trainee practice against the potential risks to patients. The appropriate time for attempted cannulation by trainees remains unclear. Patients and methods: Three different time limits (5, 10, 15 minutes) were set for cannulation attempts made by four trainees in patients with native papilla undergoing ERCP. Patients were randomly assigned to the 5-, 10-, or 15-minute groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Rectal indomethacin was used in high-risk patients. The primary outcome was successful cannulation within the allocated time. Secondary outcomes included performance scores, overall success rate, and post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). Results: A total of 256 patients were randomly assigned to the 5-minute (n\u200a=\u200a84), 10-minute (n\u200a=\u200a86), or 15-minute (n\u200a=\u200a86) groups. Patients' baseline characteristics were comparable. Success rates for selective bile duct cannulation by trainees were 43.8\u200a%, 75.0\u200a%, and 71.8\u200a% in the 5-, 10-, and 15-minute groups, respectively (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Trainees' self-reported performance scores and video assessment by an independent reviewer were comparable between the 10- and 15-minute groups, which were higher than the 5-minute group (both P \u200a<\u200a0.001). Trainers took over the cannulation procedure when trainees did not succeed within the allocated time. There was no significant difference in the overall success rates in cannulation between the three groups. No differences were noted in the use of rectal indomethacin and overall complication rates. Four patients in each group developed PEP (P\u200a=\u200a0.996). Conclusion: A time of 10 minutes was considered to be appropriate for trainees to attempt cannulation, with acceptable cannulation success rates and complications.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number (NCT01851226).",

Here, 38 genes differentially expressed genes between gastric cancer and normal gastric mucosa by in silico approaches. A potassium channel protein KCNE2, identified as a down-regulated gene in gastric cancer, was chosen for further study. We investigated the expression of KCNE2 in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines and examined the effect of KCNE2 on proliferation of gastric cancer. The expression of KCNE2 was markedly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Forced overexpression of KCNE2 suppressed the growth of SGC7901 cells and cell cycle progression significantly, which might be related to the down-regulation of Cyclin D1. KCNE2 also inhibited SGC7901 cell growth in soft agar and its tumorigenicity in nude mice. Taken together, our work showed that in silico analysis approaches could be used to identify cancer-related genes effectively. KCNE2, as a novel down-regulated gene in gastric cancer, suppressed cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of stomach.",

        "abstract": "The discovery that siRNA can direct gene-specific silencing in both model organisms and mammalian cells through RNA interference has provided a valuable platform for dissecting the function of independent genes. Recently the generation of large-scale RNAi library has provided a unique opportunity to perform high-throughput genetics in these complex cell systems. It also allows for the identification of known and novel genes involved in complex cellular phenotypes and biological processes. It is expected that siRNA library will be a useful tool in cancer research to discover and analyze genes that regulate various biological pathways of cancer. In this review, we summarized the reported techniques for constructing siRNA library, and further elucidated some key points such as resources, expression pattern and introduction into mammalian cells during the construction of siRNA library.",

        "abstract": "Infection with human papillomaviruses is strongly associated with the development of multiple cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The HPV E6 gene is essential for the oncogenic potential of HPV. The regulation of apoptosis by oncogene has been related to carcinogenesis closely; therefore, the modulation of E6 on cellular apoptosis has become a hot research topic recently. Inactivation of the pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor p53 by E6 is an important mechanism by which E6 promotes cell growth; it is expected that inactivation of p53 by E6 should lead to a reduction in cellular apoptosis, numerous studies showed that E6 could in fact sensitize cells to apoptosis. The molecular basis for apoptosis modulation by E6 is poorly understood. In this article, we will present an overview of observations and current understanding of molecular basis for E6-induced apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "The role of telomere in drug resistance has not been clearly understood. Recent studies have been focused on telomerase activity and telomere length, but the findings are still controversial. It's been found that DNA double-strand breaks induced by anticancer drugs or irradiation increase TRF2 expression as an early response to DNA damage, which inhibits activation of ATM-dependent DNA damage response network, indicating TRF2 might probably be a general DNA-repair factor rather than merely a telomere-binding factor. In this study, the possible involvement of telomerase, telomere and TRF2 in DNA damage response and drug resistance was investigated. Telomere length was found elongated in multidrug-resistant variants of gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 treated with adriamycin or etoposide, however, drug-treatment per se had no effect on telomere length. Telomerase activity and TRF2 expression were upregulated after treatment, but not TRF1. TRF2 upregulation was more dramatic in drug-resistant cells and occurred before the expression of ATM, gammaH2AX and p53. Moreover, TRF2 inhibited the expression of ATM-dependent DSB responsive genes. Inhibition of TRF2 expression by RNA interference in drug-resistant cells partially reversed its resistance phenotype and overexpression of TRF2 in SGC7901 promoted its resistance phenotype. Taken together, current results indicate that TRF2 plays an important role in DNA damage response, and is involved in drug resistance of gastric cancer. Further study of the biological functions of TRF2 might be helpful to dissect the molecular mechanism of multiple drug-resistance and generate novel target to overcome it.",

Comparative studies and clinical significance of CFV and PTA were analyzed by SPSS and SDAS softwares.1. The levels of CFV and PTA were 15.3%+/-9.7% and 23.5%+/-10.0%, respectively, at the onset of severe hepatitis. 2. The mortality of severe hepatitis gradually increased with the gradual decrease of CFV or PTA during the most severe stage of the illness (P=0.000). 3. The levels of CFV and PTA decreased continually and rapidly in patients who died but gradually increased in survivors. The decrease or increase of PTA preceded that of CFV on the exacerbation or convalescent stage. 4. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 14 cases (24.14%). In 10 cases, it occurred in the terminal stage of the illness, far later than the time of the decrease of CFV. 5. The level of CFV was closely related to PTA (the correlation coefficient was 0.812), the level of CFV was almost consistent with that of PTA.1. The level of CFV is an important prognostic indicator in severe hepatitis and is more specific than PTA. 2. Simultaneous determination of CFV and PTA may be helpful in earlier and more accurate diagnosis of severe hepatitis. 3. Possible use of CFV as one of the criteria for liver transplantation in patients with severe hepatitis should be studied.",

The results show that upper trough and shear line and thermal depression are main synoptic systems introducing summer sand-dust storm. The value of air pressure, wind speed and relative humidity increased, and the value of air temperature descended when the summer sand-dust storm occured, but the changing extents were less than that of meteorological elements in spring sand-dust storm. The summer sand-dust storm is as characteristics of middle-small scale cloud cluster on cloud image, the cloud cluster of TBB\u2264-35\u2103 can show the change of sandstorm in summer. The diagnostic analysis shows that there is convergence in low level and divergence in upper level, sandstorm happened after the appearance of max vertical velocity, and at the same time, the helicity in eve of sand-dust storm eruption has good indication in the forecasting of sand-dust storm. When the helicity is large, the sand-dust storm is severe.",

It was found that BNFR participated in the curing of epoxy compounds and the hardeners and thus present as a part of the network. The 5 % and 10 % degradation temperatures of the system were increased about 15\u2103 by the inclusion of BNFR. When the loading of BNFR was 6 % (m-phenyl diamine as hardener) or 11% (phthalic anhydride or JA-1 modified amine as hardener), a grade of UL 94V-0 and a limit oxygen index of 26 were obtained. The fire retardancy and thermal stability of the epoxy resin system may be further enhanced with increasing cross-linking density. The optimum ratio of bromine to antimony was found to be 3:1.",

Methods We detected the distribution of the two isoforms of VLDLR in different fetal tissues and amplified the whole cDNA of VLDLR \u2161 from fetal human brain by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The products were linked with pcDNA3. 0 vector to construct pcDNA-VLDLR \u2161 recombinant. Expression plasmid containing VLDLR \u2161 were introduced into ldl-A7 cells, and stable transformants were obtained by placing the cells in selective medium which contained G418. Finally, the ligand-binding affinity of ldl-A7 cells stably expressing VLDLR was determined with DiI-labeled VLDL. Results It was found that there was an significant difference in ligand-binding affinity between VLDLR \u2161 and VLDLR \u2160 . The ligand-binding affinity of VLDLR \u2161 was approximately half that of VLDLR \u2160 . Conclusion Biologically, the functional difference of the two forms of VLDLR may play a unique role in the developing cerebrum.",

Results In cells incubated with free cholesterol and oxidative cholesterol, XBP-1 and ACAT-2 mRNA levels in HepG2 cell and Caco2 cell were up-regulated, and were dependent on the concentration increase. Conclusions Both of cholesterol and oxidative cholesterol can induce UPR, and ACAT-2 mRNA level can be up-regulated, the results imply the possibility that ACAT-2 may be regulated by UPR; in view of ACAT-2 playing an important role in the cholesterol esterification and absorption, UPR may have important significance in cholesterol absorption.",

        "abstract": "The research aims to explore the molecular characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ethambutol resistance in Wuhan,to establish a rapid test method about the EMB resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to understand the transmission of Beijing genotype. PCR amplification was performed on the 85 isolates to characterize the embB gene. At the same time,the identification of Beijing genotype in the 85 clinical isolates was performed using RD105 deletion-targeted multiplex PCR. The results show that 15( 68. 2%) of the 22 ethambutol resistant isolates were found to have a mutation in the embB gene and among the 15 isolates,fourteen had a mutation at codon 306,the mutation types were M306V ATG\u2192GTG and M306I ATG\u2192ATA,the other one was at codon 319,Y319C TAT\u2192TGT; Meanwhile,five of the 43 EMB susceptible isolates had also found a mutation in embB gene,four was at codon 306 and one was at codon 319. Of the 85 clinical isolates,78( 91. 8%) were Beijing genotypes and 7( 8. 2%) were non-Beijing genotypes. According to the research,mutations in embB are not only found in ethambutol resistant isolates,but also in ethambutol susceptible isolates. Because the ethambutol resistant isolates are also resistant to other drugs at the same time,we can't exclude the relationship between other drugs and mutations in embB at codon 306. Therefore,the role of embB306 mutations remains unclear. In addition,\"Beijing genotype\"strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were typically prevalent in Wuhan,which should arouse our more attention.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)-related death has increased globally recently. To obtain information of the species and characterization of pathogens involved in NTM pulmonary infection in Southern-central China, we identified 160 non-tuberculous infection cases from 3995 acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive tuberculous suspects. We then randomly selected 101 non-tuberculous patients, isolated bacteria from their sputa and genotyped the pathogens using the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequences. M. intracellulare (32.67%, 33/101), M. abscessus (32.67%, 33/101) and M. fortuitum (7.92%, 8/101) are identified in these isolates. Surprisingly, non-mycobacteria including Gordonia (8.91%, 9/101), Nocardia (5.94%, 6/101) and Tsukamurella (0.99%, 1/101) are also discovered, and the case of Tsukamurella pulmonis infection is first discovered in Southern-central China. Moreover, species of M. mucogenicum group, M. chubuense, M. kansasii, M. gastri, M. avium, M. porcinum and M. smegmatis are identified. In addition, nine immune compromised cases (8.91%, 9/101), including type two diabetes mellitus and HIV/AIDS are found to be infected with non-tuberculous bacteria. This study revealed the distribution and characteristics of non-tuberculous AFB pathogen infection occurred in Southern-central China, and suggested that physicians should be alert of the emerging of NTM and non-mycobacteria infection in AFB positive cases and take caution when choosing chemotherapy for tuberculosis-like pulmonary infections. Generally, this study may help with the development of new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infection.",

It was found that \u03b2-VLDL induced an increase in ERK1/2\n activity in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. By using different protein kinases inhibotors\n or activators, it was observed that the effect of \u03b2-VLDL induced VLDL receptor transcription, which was monitored by RT-PCR\n analysis of VLDL receptor mRNA, was not affected by the inhibitor of p38 kinase and cAMP analog, but extremely abolished by\n pretreating cells with PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK and GF 109203 X, an inhibitor of PKC. These results demonstrated that\n the PKC-ERK1/2 cascade is the essential signaling pathway by which \u03b2-VLDL activated VLDL-R mRNA expression. Inhibition of\n the ERK1/2 signaling cascade resulted in suppression of the cellular lipid accumulation induced by \u03b2-VLDL in macrophages.\n ",

Chlortetracycline immuno-antigen (CTC-BSA) was prepared by conjugating chlortetracycline to bovine serum albumin via glutaraldehyde, and injected into rabbits to prepare anti-CTC polyclonal antibody. The resulted anti- CTC antibody was purified, and its titer and specificity was determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Subsequently, colloidal gold particles 15 nm in size were prepared by the method of trisodium citrate reduction. The purified anti-CTC antibody was finally conjugated to colloidal gold particles served as a detection reagent to pack the immunochromatographic (IC) strip. A positive reaction gave a visual color to assess the residue level of CTC. Results suggested that the limit of quantification of CTC was 0.7 \u03bcg/mL. Cross-reactivity could not be observed till the concentration of tetracycline was higher than 1 \u03bcg/mL. Chlortetracycline content obtained with the IC strips provided a positive correlation with that obtained by HPLC method. Using this method, the analysis of CTC in food could be completed within less than 5 min.",

The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effects of VLDL and beta-VLDL on VLDLR expression and its signaling pathway. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with VLDL and beta-VLDL. The expression of VLDLR mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The transcriptional activity of VLDLR gene was detected in recombinant plasmid pGL4.2VR-luciferase transfected RAW264.7. Western blot assay was used to detect the changes of phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein. Inhibitors or activators were used to observe the signal pathway involving VLDLR expression regulation. The results showed that VLDL and beta-VLDL stimulated ERK1/2 activity in a PKC-dependent manner. VLDL or beta-VLDL-induced VLDLR expression on macrophages was extremely abolished by inhibitors ERK1/2 or PKC. Our findings revealed that VLDL or beta-VLDL-induced VLDLR expression via PKC/ERK cascades and the effect was linked to the transcriptional activation of VLDLR gene promoter.",

By using different protein kinases inhibitors or activators, it was observed that the effect of beta-VLDL induced VLDL receptor transcription, which was monitored by RT-PCR analysis of VLDL receptor mRNA, was not affected by the inhibitor of p38 kinase and cAMP analog, but extremely abolished by pretreating cells with PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK and GF 109203X, an inhibitor of PKC. These results demonstrated that the PKC-ERK1/2 cascade is the essential signaling pathway by which beta-VLDL activated VLDL-R mRNA expression.

        "abstract": "Reported data indicate that cholesterol loading in the liver can cause hepatic injury. To explore the possible mechanisms of cell damage resulting from cholesterol overloading in hepatocytes, cell apoptosis, the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the correlation between them were assessed in the cholesterol-overloaded normal human hepatic cell line L02. L02 cells were incubated with 200 microg/ ml of low density lipoprotein (LDL) for 24 h with or without 20 microg/ml 58035, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). In the LDL+58035 group, the intracellular cholesterol level was dramatically increased, which was measured by an enzymatic combined high performance liquid chromatography assay. Expression of immunoglobulin-binding protein, X-box binding protein 1, activating transcription factor 6, activating transcription factor 4, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein-10, markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)/ UPR, were up-regulated as determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or Western blot analysis. The rate of cell apoptic death increased 21.3+/-2.4%. Meanwhile, the active caspase-3 protein expression was increased 8.4-fold compared to the active caspase-3 protein expression in the controls. Furthermore, 4-phenylbutyric acid, an inhibitor of UPR, partly reduced cell apoptosis and activation of caspase-3. This study suggests that cholesterol overloading in hepatic L02 cells induces ERS and activates the UPR which, in part, leads to the apoptotic damage of cells.",

But there are only several kinds of commercial antibodies and the price is on the high side. Objective: To get the monoclonal antibody against the c-terminal of very low density lipoprotein receptor for the future study. Methods: In order to obtain the very low density lipoprotein receptor, hybridoma IgG 6A6 cells related with very low density lipoprotein receptor intracellular domain was injected into peritoneal of Balb/c mice. After 2 weeks, ascites was collected, and the target protein was preliminary purified by salting-out method (n-octanoic acid-saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation method) and further purified by affinity chromatography, and the monoclonal antibody related with very low density lipoprotein receptor intracellular domain was obtained. The relative molecular mass and purity were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the activity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results and Conclusion: Western Blotting results showed that the antibody from the ascites directly can bind the very low density lipoprotein receptor protein, but the background was not clear. The purified antibody from the ascites through salting-out method (n-octanoic acid-saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation method) and then by protein A affinity chromatography can bind specifically with the very low density lipoprotein receptor. The pure and activity monoclonal antibodies can be obtained through purification by the salting-out method and Protein A Agarose.",

A total of 32 neonatal male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: negative control group, positive control group, low(370 mg/(kg \u00b7 d)) and high dose DHA group(740 mg/(kg \u00b7 d)). After 8 weeks of feeding, the enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase(AChE) and nitric oxide synthase(NOS) in brain tissue of rats were analyzed. The mRNA expressions of N-methylD-aspartate receptor subunit(NR1), cAMP responsive element binding protein( CERB), immediate early gene( c-fos) in the hippocampus of rats were determined by RT-PCR. Results showed that compared to the negative control group, DHA at both doses was able to significantly increase AChE and NOS activities in brain tissue as well as the mRNA expression levels of NR1, CREB and c-fos while the low dose presented higher effect. In summary, DHA could remarkably improve learning and memory abilities in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism might be involved with the upregulation of NR1, CREB and c-fos mRNA expression by DHA in the hippocampus of rats.",

Methods: Totally 64 rats were randomly divided into eight groups: normal feed group, defatted soybean meal(2.5 g/(kg \u00b7 d)) group, walnut oil(2.5 mL/(kg \u00b7 d)) group, walnut(3.0 g/(kg \u00b7 d))) group and defatted walnut meal groups at doses of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 g/(kg \u00b7 d) and 4.0 g/(kg \u00b7 d). Following continuous feeding for 60 days, Step-down and Morris water maze tests were used to evaluate the learning and memory ability of rats. The contents of superoxide dismutase(SOD), malondialdehyde(MDA), acetylcholinesterase(AChE) and nitric oxide synthase(NOS) in brain tissues of rats were determined. Results: Moderate consumption of defatted walnut meal could greatly improve the performance of Step-down and Morris water maze tests, increase the activities of SOD and AChE in brain tissues of rats and reduce MDA level. Conclusion: Defatted walnut meal can obviously improve the learning and memory abilities and antioxidant capacity of rats.",

The negative trickle-down effect is caused by the ratchet effect on consumption,deformity development of housing market,less Public Sector Goods and Services.

Unfortunately it is influenced by many factors, among which the effect of soil sample preparation is discussed. Test researches show that soil sampling mass and test results is of little influence by three funnel bores (4.5, 5, 5.5 mm) and three drop heights (5, 10, 15 mm) while they are much influenced by degree of grinding of soil. The specified standard that soil particle size is less than 0.5 mm is not perfect and the results of free swelling ratio for three soil particle sizes (0.25-0.5, 0.1-0.25, <0.1 mm) is widely variable, it is discovered that the finest soil (<0.1 mm) is reduced by 30%-45% and isn't consistent with other indexes for expansive soil classification. The contrast is studied and mass difference of particle up to 2 g measured by a cup of 10 ml is found; the conclusion that the results is influenced by particle mass is established and the changing of structure is a possible reason. At last the particle size between 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm is suggested.",

Based on the geological conditions discovered during the middle pilot heading excavation, some revisions were made with respect to the karst hazard zoning in order to guide the advance forecasting in the main tunnel. Meanwhile, the high-density electrical method was combined with the geological radar method, improving the accuracy of forecasting in major karst hazards. The excavation results show that the outcomes of advance geological forecasting are highly consistent with the actual ones.",

Therefore, a diagnosis method of residual chi-square test assisted by restricted adaptive filter was proposed to solve the problem. A restricted adaptive filtering algorithm was derived based on Bayesian theory to estimate the observation noise matrix automatically and on-line. In doing so, the proposed algorithm could prevent the filtering prediction from tracking soft faults and then assist the residual chi-square test during fault detection. To overcome the problems of filtering precision decline and the increase of the error detection rate caused by immediately isolating fault method, a fault disposal and reconstruction method was developed based on one-step predicting information, which is generated by forecasting the current navigation information using the resolved results in the frontal time. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively diagnose suddenly changing faults and soft faults online, and ensure system precision during the failure phase. Moreover, the system can be recovered timely from the fault state when the fault signals disappear, and thus the system reliability can be improved.",

First, the existence of the over exposure stars was confirmed with real star images. Then, by analyzing the grey distribution of over exposed stars, the over-exposure scale of every row/column was detected according to the corresponding grey value and the square weighted mass centroiding was applied to calculation of primary local results. Finally, an over-exposure scale related to scaling scheme was used again to decide corresponding weights of local results and the final result was obtained after a last integration. The simulation results prove that in an all-random experiment mode the final centroiding accuracy has be better than 0.05 pixel even the random noise is 30 pixel. The proposed algorithm is validated to be competent and could satisfy the demand of the centroiding algorithm for the high-accuracy and good adaptability in real applications.",

In this method, which the uncertain noise effect is controlled by adjusting the filter gain in real-time so that the fault tolerant performance is improved. The design of hidden units and width of kernel function is important for the RBF neural network, so the number of hidden units and the width of kernel function are optimized by using the adaptive genetic algorithm. The centers of hidden units are calculated by using the K-mean clustering algorithm and the weights of output layer are calculated by using the least square algorithm. At last, the network structure is optimized, and the algorithm has high accuracy too. In order to test the effect of this method, the simulation based on the SINS/GPS integration navigation system is demonstrated, and it indicates this proposed method has stronger fault tolerant ability than the standard kalman filter under the condition of satisfying the navigation accuracy and adding less calculation. This also proves the availability of the proposed method.",

Firstly, the features of gray and texture are fused to enhance the target information. Then coefficients based on the gray and texture histograms of the background pixels around the target are computed and incorporated into the computation of gray and texture histograms. After the accurate localization of the infrared target obtained, an objective function based on the similarity of background and target is proposed. Finally, the adaptive bandwidth is obtained through making the objective function minimum. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effectiv and robust and can be adapted to the target change in scale.",

So there will be some restriction when this algorithm is used for GPS signal acquisition. Based on this point, the traditional coherent average algorithm was improved at first. Directly by compensating the frequency of the intermediate frequency signal, the period of the signal was changed to satisfy the requirement without confirming the period, and the SNR was raised. Then common FFT algorithm and Averaging Correlation algorithm were respectively used to determine the Doppler shift and the initial phase of PN. Sampled data from GPS Receiver and simulated high dynamic GPS signals were used for simulation experiments. Simulation results indicate that the computational cost is decreased a lot, compared with that of the traditional algorithm's, and this algorithm will work in order under low SNR conditions.",

Aiming at this problem, an initial alignment method for MIMU/GPS integrated navigation system is put forward. This method realizes the initial alignment by finding the relationship between the carrier and navigation coordinate systems from the different expressions of the same displacement vector in different coordinate systems. Firstly, a short displacement is positioned by GPS. Secondly, the initial alignment angles are inversely calculated by the position result in strapdown resolving in order to get the accurate solution, and the genetic algorithm is introduced to solve the nonlinear equations. Lastly, the method is certified by six sets of misalignment data. The results indicate that the method is effective with its high alignment accuracy and fast alignment process. In addition, this method is independent of outer information, so the alignment cost is saved.",

The acquired data were fused to compute the position and velocity of carrier. In order to evaluate the combination the effect of system, the difference GPS with high precision were imported as a standard source to compare with the combination results. The experiment results show that the combination system can accomplish the navigational task satisfactorily.",

So, the transform matrix with both quaternion form and Euler form used to transform attitude angular error into the mathematic platform angular error is deduced in this paper.

Firstly, the adaptive filter model based on FIS is built, which adjusts really the measure noise so as to estimate the system status accurately and come to the goal of adaptive fault tolerant. Secondly, the adaptive genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of membership function so as to improve the output precision of FIS and overcome the problem of output precision depending on the expert knowledge maturity. Finally, the simulation based on SINS/GPS integration navigation system is demonstrated, which introduces the measure noise fault in the middle work time.

All medication was administered three times daily for 5 days. The fever disappearance time, the fever disappearance rate, efficacy of TCM syndrome, the disappearance rate of main symptoms and physical signs of flu, the negative rate of virus nucleic acid in the pharyngeal secretion, and safety indicators were assessed.The median fever disappearance time was 32.8 h (95% CI: 22.5-41.0 h) in the high dose JHG group, 26.0 h (95% CI: 14.5-36.5 h) in the low dose JHG group, 39.5 h (95% CI: 29.0-46.0 h) in the placebo control group. There was statistical difference in the median fever disappearance time between the low dose JHG group and the placebo control group (P = 0.011). Three days after treatment, the markedly effective rate of TCM symptoms in the low dose JHG group was 66.7%, higher than that of the placebo control group (38.3%), and its effective rate was superior to that of the high dose JHG group (P = 0.043). Five days after treatment, the recovery rate of the low dose JHG group (42.2%) was higher than that of the high dose JHG group (25.0%, P = 0.026) and that of the placebo control group (14.9%, P = 0.002). The markedly effective rate of the low dose JHG group (86.7%) was higher than that of the placebo control group (55.3%, P = 0.001). Similar effects were obtained in the low dose JHG group and the high dose JHG group, but slightly poor in partial indicators of the high dose JHG group. There was no statistical difference in adverse reaction among these three groups (P > 0.05).JHG was effective and safe in treating influenza patients of WHAFS. Routinely low dose was the optimal dosage of JHG.",

Methods Totally 142 COPD patients in stable stage were randomized into treatment group and control group with 71 in each. They were treated with the application of Xiaochuan Plaster and placebo plaster respectively, 3 times one year, 2 years in succession. The changes in St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) score, BODE index. The annual average times of common cold and asthma acute aggravation, times of emergency consultation and hospitalization, pulmonary function, and adverse reaction of skin were observed. Results Of the treatment group, the comparison of one-year treatment and two-year treatment with before treatment showed a decrease in the total score of SGRQ and scores of symptoms, activities, and influences (P<0.05), except that there was no statistical difference in symptoms, there was statistical difference in the decrease of scores of activities and influences and total score of two-year treatment in comparing with one-year treatment and the control group in the corresponding period (P<0.05). The treatment group was better than the control group. Comparing with before treatment and one-year treatment, the decreased value of BODE index in two-year treatment of the treatment group was more than that of the control group in the corresponding period (P<0.01). Of the control group, the ratio of the forced expiratory volume at the 1st second (FEV1) and forced volume capacity (FVC) was improved in two-year treatment as compared with before treatment and one-year treatment (P<0.05), however, there was no statistical difference compared with the treatment group in the corresponding period (P>0.05). The FEV1/FVC was decreased in one-year treatment of the treatment group in comparing with before treatment (P<0.05). The FEV1% in two-year treatment of the treatment group was increased, but there was no statistical difference in the comparison with before treatment and the control group in the corresponding period (P>0.05). In the two-year treatment of the treatment group, the annual average times of common cold and asthma acute aggravation were significantly less than those of the control group in the corresponding period, and less than before treatment and one-year treatment of its own (P<0.05), and the times of emergency consultation and hospitalization were less than before treatment and those of the control group in the corresponding period (P<0.05). In the duration of two-year treatment, there was no strong adverse reaction of skin in the treated areas in both groups. The comparison of the two groups showed no statistical difference between them (P>0.05). Conclusion Application of Xiaochuan Acupoint Adhesive Plaster is effective in improving the life quality of COPD patients in stable stage, reducing the acute aggravation of asthma.

        "abstract": "In the present study, the antibacterial activity of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L. Labiatae) essential oil against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) was observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) value of rosemary essential oil against P.acnes was 0.56 mg/mL. Significant changes in morphology and size of P. acnes were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in response to essential oil treatment. The essential oil first attached to the surface of P. acnes at low concentration, the width and height of the bacterial body became larger, whereas the length did not change considerably. With increasing concentration of the essential oil, the bacterial bodies were severely damaged. The length, width and height were all reduced, when the concentration was increased up to 64xMIC, the length, width and height were reduced by 42.56%, 92.00% and 41.58%, respectively. Furthermore, treated bacteria lost their native shape, the cell wall desquamated, and the cytoplasm leaked out of the bacterial body, finally leading to bacterial death. With the increasing time at MIC, the bacteria length was reduced at 8 h, the width and height gradually became smaller, the shape of the cell became distorted, and finally led to cell wall damage and bacterial death at 8 h. In conclusion, the AFM investigation of morphology and size of P. ACNES treated with rosemary essential oil represents a powerful technique, which can generally be applied to reveal the biological changing mechanisms of bacteria induced by antibacterial agents at the nanometer level.",

To evaluate the applicability of this novel MAT method, the conversion yields of FAMEs and compositions were compared with those from the standard method of transesterification (AOAC Method 996.06). The results showed that MAT had obvious advantages to standard techniques in terms of short duration, high efficiency and stable composition. The parameters influencing the MAT procedure including microwave irradiation power, temperature, reaction time, molar ratio of methanol to oil and catalyst concentration were optimized. The maximum yield of FAMEs reached 96% under optimal MAT conditions of transesterification irradiation power 500 W, temperature 60 \u00b0C, 6 min, 1% wt catalyst and a molar ratio of methanol/oil 6:1 (v/v). Validation of the MAT method was performed in terms of repeatability and reproducibility; relative standard deviations for conversion yields were lower than 4.37 and 6.83%, respectively. These results revealed that the MAT method developed in the present investigation is suitable for the sample preparation of FAMEs from plant oils. \u00a9 2009 Springer-Verlag.",

        "abstract": "The hard sporoderm of Ganoderma lucidum spores prevents the release of bioactive components such as polysaccharides which have significant anti-tumour activity. In the present study, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC\u2013CO 2 ) was used for the sporoderm breaking of G. lucidum spores, and polysaccharides were subsequently extracted and determined for evaluating the performances of SC\u2013CO 2 . The operating parameters were optimized by orthogonal array design (OAD), and the morphological status of sporoderm was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The optimum operating conditions for SC\u2013CO 2 breaking of sporoderm were as follows: pressure 35 MPa, temperature 25 \u00b0C, time 4 h, and CO 2 flow rate 10 kg/h. After SC\u2013CO 2 processing, the extraction yield of polysaccharides reached 2.98%, which was 3-fold to that of the intact ones (0.94%). This method is fast, efficient and advanced enough to break the hard sporoderm of G. lucidum , which may provide a scientific reference for the large-scale processing of spores in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Keywords Ganoderma lucidum Polysaccharides SC\u2013CO 2 SEM Sporoderm breaking 1 Introduction Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) Karst. is a species of basidiomycetes which belongs to Ganodermataceae of Aphyllophorales ( Yang, Ke, & Kuo, 2000 ). Its fruiting body is called \u201cLingzhi\u201d in China and \u201cReishi\u201d in Japan. For thousands of years, this fungus has been regarded as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or a folk medicine for its medicinal properties. G. lucidum has been used for promotion of vitality and longevity ( Lu et al., 2004 ) and prevention and treatment of various human diseases in China and other Asian countries. It is used for the treatment of asthma, diabetes, altitude sickness, cardiovascular disease, AIDS and cancer ( Lin, 2001; Shiao, 2003; Wasser & Weis, 1999 ). G. lucidum appears to be very safe since oral administration of the extracts does not display any toxicity ( Eo, Kim, Lee, & Han, 1999a, 1999b ), and its merits have been investigated as a potential prophylactic agent for human health ( Kim & Kim, 1999 ). Though the fruiting body of G. lucidum has been utilised as medicine for several thousand years in China, its spores were recognized and utilised only in the 20th century. G. lucidum spores are tiny and mistlike particles of about 6.5\u20138.0 \u00d7 9.6\u201312.6 \u03bcm enwrapped with outer bilayers of sporoderm. The extremely hard and resilient sporoderm is a barrier for the release of components inside the spores. Previous studies suggest the spores contain a variety of bioactive components, including polysaccharides, triterpenoids, sterols, proteins, nucleosides, fatty acids and cerebrosides, as in the fruiting body ( Yeung, Lu, Zhang, & Go, 2004 ). However, the bioactivity of the spores may be much higher than that of the fruiting body ( Min, Nakamura, Miyashiro, Bae, & Hattori, 1998 ). Recent studies on Ganodermataceae fungi have demonstrated that the spores show significant anti-tumour ( Zhu, Yang, Wang, Zhao, & Chen, 2000 ), anti-aging ( Gan, Fann, Hsu, Kuo, & Lin, 1998 ), free radical-scavenging and anti-hepatotoxic ( Lin, Lin, Chen, Ujiie, & Takada, 1995; Yen & Wu, 1999 ), as well as anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease activities ( Min et al., 1998 ). However, the activities of spores are closely related to the status of sporoderm. When the sporoderm is not broken, there are fewer pharmacological effects observed and, on the contrary, the breaking of the sporoderm can improve the release of active components and exertion of their effects ( Min et al., 1998 ). Although the sporoderm-broken spores are more effective than the intact spores, it is difficult to break the sporoderm because of the limitation of general breaking technology. In previous studies, soaking, physical smashing, ultrasonic, high pressure and enzyme hydrolysis methods have been used to break the sporoderm ( Li, Li, Zhang, Xing, & Kang, 2004; Ni, Song, Li, & Xie, 2002; Wu, Zhang, & Zhu, 2004; Xie et al., 2006 ). The physical smashing method was performed by grinding the spores with an ultra smashing machine, the heat released during the process led to high temperature, which induced the decomposition of bioactive components. The soaking, ultrasonic and high pressure technology had disadvantages, such as low breaking yield, time-consumption and higher cost for special machines. The enzyme hydrolysis method was conducted by digesting the sporoderm with different types of enzymes released from mycelia, the process was slow and excessive digestion would decompose the bioactive components ( Xie et al., 2006 ). In addition, it was reported that sporoderm-broken spores, generated by different breaking methods, exhibited different inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth ( Xie et al., 2006 ), which indicated that the breaking method played an important role in the bioactivities of spores. Therefore, there is a need to develop an advanced and efficient method for sporoderm breaking of G. lucidum , which will provide high quality spore products. SC\u2013CO 2 breaking of G. lucidum spores could be an alternative method because of the unique advantages of SC\u2013CO 2 . SC\u2013CO 2 , an environment-friendly solvent, has a relatively high liquid-like density, low viscosity and high diffusivity ( Lang & Wai, 2001 ). These properties provide a very special solvent that is effective both at dissolving materials and penetrating solid matrices ( Taylor, 1996 ). In the process of SC\u2013CO 2 treatment, the temperature is relatively low and the organic solvent is excluded, so decomposition of active components is avoided. Moreover, during the dynamic process, fresh SC\u2013CO 2 flows through materials continuously; the mass transfer is intensive, which may result in a satisfactory performance. In view of these unique characteristics, SC\u2013CO 2 processing of spores is proposed as a potential breaking method for the sporoderm of G. lucidum . In the present study, sporoderm breaking of G. lucidum with SC\u2013CO 2 is presented for the first time. The polysaccharides were extracted and determined to evaluate the performances of SC\u2013CO 2 processing under different operating conditions. The effects of various process parameters, including operating pressure, operating temperature, time and CO 2 flow rate, were investigated for the optimization of the SC\u2013CO 2 breaking conditions. The morphological changes between the intact and processed spores were observed by SEM. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant material and reagents G. lucidum spores were collected from the forestry centre of Northeast Forestry University and authenticated by Prof. Shao-Quan Nie from the Key Laboratory of Forest Plant Ecology, Ministry of Education, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, PR China. Voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of this Key Laboratory. The spores were dried at 50 \u00b0C for 24 h. Phenol (analytical reagent) and sulphuric acid (chemical reagent) were bought from Tianjin Kermel chemical reagents development centre (China). Carbon dioxide (purity 99.99%) was purchased from Liming gas corp. (China). Glucose was purchased from the Institute of Medicine and Bio-product of China. Stock solution of glucose was made by dissolving 1 mg standard in 10 ml of distilled water. Respective solutions for the calibration curve were prepared by serial dilutions of the stock solution with distilled water. 2.2 SC\u2013CO 2 breaking of spores A HA121-50-01 SFE device (Hua\u2019an Supercritical Fluid Extraction corp., Nantong, China) was used to break G. lucidum spores. The operating methodology was as follows: liquid CO 2 was cooled by ethanol to \u22125 \u00b0C before being pressurized and passed into the device, the entire device was also pre-pressurized. Approximately 200 g of spores were loaded into a steel cylinder equipped with mesh filters (6.5 \u03bcm) on both ends, the filled cylinder was then introduced into the extraction vessel, and CO 2 was let in. During the breaking process, the operating pressure and CO 2 flow rate were controlled by adjusting the valves according to the pressure metre and flow metre; the temperature was set by the temperature controller. When the scheduled time was achieved, the extraction vessel was depressurized and the spores were taken out and collected. 2.3 Extraction of polysaccharides The intact and processed G. lucidum spores (2 g) were respectively extracted with 100 ml of distilled water at 75 \u00b0C for 6 h under stirring. The extracts were finally concentrated under vacuum with a rotary evaporator device. The polysaccharides-enriched fractions were precipitated by adding ethanol, filtering, and solid polysaccharides were obtained on the filter paper. Distilled water was added to the solid polysaccharides to get a sample solution for determination. 2.4 Quantification of polysaccharides The total polysaccharides concentration was determined by a modification of the phenol\u2013sulphuric acid method ( Taylor, 1995 ). A calibration curve was constructed, based on six different concentrations of glucose over the range 1.25\u201312.5 \u03bcg/ml. The curve was obtained by plotting the glucose absorbance at 488 nm versus glucose concentration in \u03bcg/ml, and a good linearity was found. The regression equation was Y = 0.0519 X \u2212 0.0003 ( r = 0.9954, n = 6), where X represents glucose concentration (\u03bcg/ml) and Y represents the glucose absorbance. One millilitre of the polysaccharides sample solution obtained above was prepared in triplicate; 5% phenol\u2013sulphuric reagent (1 ml) and concentrated H 2 SO 4 (5 ml) were subsequently added, and the mixture cooled to room temperature. The absorbance at 488 nm for each polysaccharides sample was determined with a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu corp., Japan). 2.5 SEM observation The intact and processed spores were examined by SEM to observe any morphological change that occurred in the sporoderm during the SC\u2013CO 2 treatments. The spores were mounted on aluminium stubs, coated with gold-palladium in a sputter coater and viewed at 15 kV accelerating voltage in a Hitachi S-520 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Inst., Inc., San Jose, CA). 2.6 Experimental design Orthogonal array design (OAD) was used to arrange the experiments and optimize the breaking parameters for G. lucidum spores. The effects of operating pressure, temperature and time on the breaking performance were investigated. A L 16 (4 5 ) orthogonal matrix with three factors (two unarranged columns were used for error variance estimation); each factor, containing four levels, was selected to arrange the experiments. Pressures ( P ) were 27, 30, 33, 35 MPa, temperatures, ( T ) were 25, 30, 35, 40 \u00b0C, and time ( t ) were 1, 2, 3, 4 h. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of CO 2 flow rate The effect of CO 2 flow rate on the breaking performance was investigated under the following conditions: 200 g G. lucidum spores were processed for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, with the CO 2 flow rate being 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 kg/h, respectively. The processed spores were extracted and the extraction yields of polysaccharide were determined, the results are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen from Fig. 1 , for all four different times, that the effects of CO 2 flow rate on polysaccharide extraction yields were similar i.e., in the range 4\u201310 kg/h, the yields obviously increased with the CO 2 flow rate. When CO 2 flow rate exceeded 10 kg/h, the yields did not increase much further. It was known that, when the flow rate was higher, more SC\u2013CO 2 passed through the spores at any time; thereby the effect on penetrating the sporoderm was stronger, resulting in a subsequent higher extraction yield. Similar results for supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of jojoba seed oil and sunflower seed oil have been reported; the mass transfer parameter increased with the supercritical fluid flow rate, normally, until it reached an asymptotic value ( Cocero & Garc\u00eda, 2001; Salg\u0131n, 2007 ). In this study, treatment at the CO 2 flow rate of 10 kg/h gave close to the highest extraction yield of polysaccharides. 3.2 Effects of operating pressure, temperature and time The effects of three factors, including operating pressure, temperature and time, on the breaking performance were investigated using a L 16 (4 5 ) orthogonal matrix with the CO 2 flow rate at 10 kg/h. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) are shown in Table 2 . The degree of significance of each factor is represented in Table 2 by its p -value; when a factor has a p -value smaller than 0.05, it influences the process in a significant way for a confidence level of 0.95. Table 2 indicates that operating pressure has the most significant influence on the extraction yield of polysaccharides ( p = 0.000001); time has significant influence ( p = 0.0004), while the operating temperature has less influence ( p = 0.284). Hence, it can be concluded that operating pressure and time are the main variables that influence the breaking performance. The extraction yields of polysaccharides increased when the operating pressure was increased from 27 to 35 MPa. Higher pressure increased the density of the SC\u2013CO 2 and the penetrating power, which enhanced the breaking process. In previous investigations on SFE of olive husk oil ( Esqu\u00edvel, Bernardo-Gil, & King, 1999 ), celery seed oil ( Papamichail, Louli, & Magoulas, 2000 ), coriander seed oil ( Ill\u00e9s, Daood, Perneczki, Szokonya, & Then, 2000 ) and sunflower oil ( Salg\u0131n, D\u00f6ker, & \u00c7al\u0131ml\u0131, 2006 ), the effect of pressure has been reported. Our results are consistent with these data. Other studies have shown that temperature has a significant effect on the extraction yields of some compounds ( Mac\u00edas-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007; V\u00e1gi et al., 2007 ). The yields at different temperatures depended on a complex balance between the varying of the SC\u2013CO 2 density and the solubility of compounds in it. In our study, the operating temperature did not show significant effects on the yield of polysaccharides. The possible reason was that CO 2 served to penetrate the hard sporoderm rather than dissolving the polysaccharides in the SC\u2013CO 2 fluids. From Table 1 , it can be observed that the highest extraction yield (2.98%) was obtained at the operating pressure of 35 MPa, operating temperature 25 \u00b0C, and time 4 h. 3.3 Empirical correlation Empirical correlation was presented using the experimental data and Statistica 6.0 program. The correlation related the extraction yield of polysaccharides to the main variables-operating pressure and time. Eq. (1) is expressed as follows: (1) Y = \u2013 11.3092 + 0.7271 P + 0.3188 t - 0.0096 P 2 - 0.0031 Pt - 0.02 t 2 , where Y is the extraction yield of polysaccharides (% dry weight of spores), P is the operating pressure (MPa), and t is time (h). The correlation coefficient is 0.9686, and the observed value versus predicted value of this model is shown in Fig. 2 . Eq. (1) is represented graphically in Fig. 3 for the different operating conditions. Eq. (1) predicts that the highest extraction yield is obtained at the operating pressure of 37.2 MPa and the breaking time of 4.1 h, which are quite close to the experimental data, the operating pressure of 35 MPa and treatment time of 4 h, respectively. Therefore, Eq. (1) is appropriate for revealing the relationship between the extraction yield of polysaccharides and the operating pressure and processing time. From the above results, the appropriate operating conditions to obtain a better breaking performance are, pressure 35 MPa, temperature 25 \u00b0C, time 4 h, and CO 2 flow rate 10 kg/h. Under the optimum conditions, the extraction yield of polysaccharides is 2.98%, which is significantly higher than the 0.94% for the intact ones. 3.4 SEM images The intact and processed G. lucidum spores were examined by SEM to investigate the morphological changes in the surface of sporoderm during the breaking process. SEM images of untreated and treated spores are presented in Fig. 4 . Under SEM, the intact spores were ovate-oblong or ovoid with truncated apex or blunt taper. There were some sinuous depressions or mini holes on the surface of the spores. The processed spores showed morphological changes. Some spores had crevices on the sporoderm, some had a gap and some were totally broken. A comparison of the SEM images of intact spores and processed spores under 35 MPa for 2, 3, and 4 h (see Fig. 4 a\u2013c and f) showed that the mini holes on the processed spores were larger than those in the intact ones. The holes on the sporoderm of the processed spores were obviously larger, with longer breaking time. Fig. 4 a, d, e and f show the SEM images of the intact spores and spores processed for 4 h under different pressures. It can be observed that processed spores had crevices and hollows and the effect was obvious on the high pressure processed ones. From Fig. 4 , we conclude that high pressure and long breaking time are helpful for changing the shape of the spores and the status of the sporoderm. Although the total number of spores broken by SC\u2013CO 2 was not high (approximately 10% at a high pressure of 35 MPa), the polysaccharides extraction yield of processed spores was much higher than that of the intact ones. The reason is that the SC\u2013CO 2 treatment improved the permeability of the spores and enlarged the mini holes on the sporoderm. This facilitates the extraction of polysaccharides from the spores. Our results also show that the morphological changes on the sporoderm can improve the release of bioactive components from broken spores. SC\u2013CO 2 is helpful in sporoderm breaking of G. lucidum spores. With this processing, the highly active components in spores are freely available in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) decoctions, extracts from TCM obtained by boiling it in water. CO 2 is safer than organic solvents, and much less decomposition of active components occurs under the low temperature breaking process. 4 Conclusions In the present study, SC\u2013CO 2 breaking of G. lucidum spores was investigated. Better breaking performance was obtained with the operating pressure 35 MPa, temperature 25 \u00b0C, time 4 h, and CO 2 flow rate 10 kg/h. Under these optimum breaking conditions, the extraction yield of polysaccharides in treated spores reached 2.98%, which was three times greater than that in the intact ones (0.94%). Obvious morphological changes on the sporoderm of processed spores were observed compared to the intact spores. According to the above results, it can be concluded that SC\u2013CO 2 is a fast and efficient method for breaking the sporoderm and improving the release of polysaccharides from G. lucidum spores. It also provides a new technique for the production of sporoderm-broken spores of G. lucidum for the market.

In this study, proanthocyanidins-functionalized gold nanoparticles were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The obtained gold nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. UV-Vis and FTIR results indicated that the obtained products were mainly spherical in shape, and that the phenolic hydroxyl of proanthocyanidins had strong interactions with the gold surface. TEM and XRD determination revealed that the synthesized gold nanoparticles had a highly crystalline structure and good monodispersity. The application of proanthocyanidins-functionalized gold nanoparticles for the removal of dyes and heavy metal ions Ni, Cu, Cd and Pb in an aqueous solution was investigated. The primary results indicate that proanthocyanidins-functionalized gold nanoparticles had high removal rates for the heavy metal ions and dye, which implies that they have potential applications as a new kind of adsorbent for the removal of contaminants in aqueous solution.",

        "abstract": "The adsorption of chitosan onto highly ordered pyrolytic graphite(HOPG) surfaces and its applications have been studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that chitosan topography formed on the HOPG surface significantly depends on the pH conditions and its concentration for the incubation. Under strongly acidic conditions (pH < 3.5) and at a concentration of 1 mg ml\u207b\u00b9, chitosan formed into uniform network structures composed of fine chains. When the solution pH was changed from 3.5 to 6.5, chitosan tends to form a thicker film. Under neutral and basic conditions, chitosan changed into spherical nanoparticles, and their sizes were increased with increasing pH. Dendritic structures have been observed when the chitosan concentration was increased up to 5 mg ml\u207b\u00b9. In addition, the chitosan topography can also be influenced by ionic strength and the addition of different metal ions. When 0.1 M metal ions Na+, Mg\u00b2+, Ca\u00b2+ and Cu\u00b2+ were added into the chitosan solution at pH 3.0 for the incubation, network structures, branched chains, block structures and dense networks attached with many small particles were observed, respectively. The potential applications of these chitosan structures on HOPG have been explored. Preliminary results characterized by AFM and XPS indicated that the chitosan network formed on the HOPG surface can be used for AFM lithography, selective adsorption of gold nanoparticles and DNA molecules.",

        "abstract": "China has a large area of inland saline-alkali land, equivalent to 40% of the total cultivated land in the country. The principal\n features of these lands are high salt content, high pH, and poor soil structure with low water infiltration and poor drainage.\n These conditions effectively prevent the exploitation of such land for agriculture. In this study, we have compared 17 soil\n conditioning agents for their abilities to promote seed germination and growth under both laboratory and field conditions.\n One of these, Hydrolyzed Polymaleic Anhydride (HPMA), was identified as a highly effective agent for soil improvement. Laboratory\n germination experiments and laboratory and field cultivation of a variety of plants both showed that addition of HPMA could\n significantly increase the germination percentage and plant growth rate. Distinct from other Ca-carrier agents such as gypsum,\n HPMA increases the dissolution of CaCO3, which is abundant in the calcareous saline-alkali soils. This allows Ca2+ in soil solution to displace the over-abundant Na+ in the soil colloids. This process greatly improves soil properties such as the bulk density, which decreased, and the capillary\n soil rise height of water and soil water infiltration rate, which increased. Direct SEM and AFM imagery showed flocculent\n soil precipitation (soil aggregates) after HPMA addition, and a looser structure of those aggregates. The addition of HPMA\n also reduced the soil pH and EC. These changes in soil chemical and physical properties are a likely explanation for the soil\n improvement effected by HPMA. The high content of insoluble CaCO3 in saline-alkali land such as that in northeastern China (up to 13%) favors the further exploration of HPMA as an ameliorative\n agent.",

Pinostrobin can inhibit HSV-1 replication with 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 22.71 \u00b1 1.72 \u03bcg/ml. MTT assay showed HSV-1 was significantly inhibited when pretreated with pinostrobin, with the inhibition of 85.69 \u00b1 2.59%. Significant changes in morphology and size of HSV-1 were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in response to pinostrobin treatment. AFM topography and phase images showed that with increasing time, the envelope was shedded and damaged, finally leading to virus inactivation. With increasing concentration, pinostrobin caused a gradual leakage, also contributing to breakage of the envelope and virus inactivation. Treatment effect of oral pinostrobin in vivo showed that pinostrobin (50mg/kg/dose) possesses definite therapeutical effect in the development of lesion score. In general, the results showed that AFM represents a powerful technique for the investigation of morphology and size of HSV-1 treated by antiviral agents. AFM is applicable to study chemically induced morphological changes at the nanometer level.",

The nanoparticles have been characterized and studied by TEM, AFM, XPS, and UV spectroscopy. The synthesized nanoparticles are prone to connect with each other and form large nanoclusters. The diameters of the nanoparticles are 46 \u00b1 26 nm. It is believed that a porous network structure exists inside the nanoparticles. The UV absorption spectra of the nanoparticles are sensed with pH and can be reversibly changed according to the pH level. This phenomenon of the nanoparticles has some potential applications.

The synthesized gold colloidal solution was very stable and can be stored at room temperature for more than 6 months. The color of the colloidal solution can change from wine red to mauve, purple and blue during the acidifying process. This color changing phenomenon is attributed to the aggregation of gold nanoparticles resulted from hydrogen bond formation between the histidines adsorbed on the gold nanoparticles surfaces.

When equal volume of 2mM cisplatin and 5ng/microl 1134bp DNA fragment were incubated for 30min, 1h, 2h and 3h, the observed DNA were gradually changed from the extended chains to the bending structures, the worm-like structures and flat particles. The formation of these structures can be attributed to the coordination and electrostatic interactions by binding of cisplatin on DNA. When longer DNA fragments such as pBR322/pstI DNA (4361bp) and lambda DNA (48502bp) were used for interacting with cisplatin in the same condition, the observed DNA molecules tended to form many loop structures. The differences of the interactions between long and short DNA can be ascribed to the strong intramolecular interactions within the long DNA fragment. When the relative low concentration of cisplatin (100micromol/l) was used in the experiments, the observed DNA tended to bend along its chains. Furthermore, the measured contour length and the calculated persistent length of cisplatin-DNA were gradually decreased with the incubated time. All of these AFM results revealed that the cisplatin-DNA interactions in vitro can be influenced by the concentration and the initial state of cisplatin, the length of DNA fragment and the reaction time.",

When HA concentration was increased from 10 to 1,000 mg/L, HA can sequentially form spherical particles, layered structures, and connected blocks on HOPG surfaces. The findings of the layer structures and small amount of fine chains have been verified and discussed. When HA was acidified by addition of acetic acid, it changed into small rigid particles. These results indicated that HA can be considered as supramolecular associations of self-assembling heterogeneous and relatively small molecules, and a small amount of polymers. The present results are important for understanding HA molecular structures and their adsorption characteristic on carbonaceous surfaces.",

However, high resolution structures formed by oxaliplatin and different linear DNA remain unclear. This study characterized, the key structures of different linear DNA in the platination process by UV absorption spectra and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Bathochromic shift and hyperchromicity in UV spectra after addition of oxaliplatin revealed that it can disrupt base stacking of DNA in the platination process. AFM results of different linear DNA indicated that, the platination process can induce DNA change from an extended conformation to the network structure with many kinks and finally to the compact particles, or toroids with increasing the incubation time. All AFM results confirmed that, platination of different linear DNA by oxaliplatin is a time depended process. The present AFM results provide, structural evidence about the interactions between oxaliplatin and different linear DNA containing multiple targets.

The formation of chitosan-functionalized Ag nanoparticles was verified by UV-Vis, FTIR, TEM, AFM and XRD measurements. FTIR results revealed that the primary amine groups and amide groups of chitosan have specific interactions with the surface of Ag nanoparticles. The average diameter of the Ag nanoparticles is 10.0\u00b15.4nm as determined by TEM. Ag nanoparticles are highly crystalline as revealed by HR-TEM and XRD measurements. The size and shape of Ag nanoparticles are also found to depend on the pH condition in the synthesis. Ag nanoparticles were the main products at pH5.0 whereas large Ag nanotriangle and truncated triangular nanoplate were dominant at pH4.0 in the synthesis. Due to its monodispersity and good stability, the chitosan-functionalized Ag colloid synthesized at pH5.0 was further tested for its antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungus. The results of zone of inhibition, inhibition ratio and SEM characterization revealed that chitosan-functionalized Ag nanoparticles have great bactericidal efficiency against both bacteria and fungus.",

In this study, we explored the covalent linking of docetaxel and albumin via one organic linker. 6-Maleimidocaproic acid was applied to link the C2' hydroxyl group of docetaxel with the cysteine-34 of albumin to obtain 1:1 docetaxel-albumin conjugate. The synthesized conjugate can control the release of docetaxel in the bovine serum. Furthermore, in vitro cell cytotoxicity experiments indicated that the docetaxel-albumin conjugate have high activities for human prostate cancer cell line PC3 and human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.

The obtained Ag nanoparticles-nanocellulose nanocomposites were characterized by UV\u2013Vis, FTIR, TEM, AFM and XRD measurements. The TEM and AFM observation results indicated that the synthesized silver nanoparticles are spherical and randomly distributed on the nanocellulose fibrils. The FTIR results confirmed that the nanocellulose is associated with the Ag nanoparticles. XRD measurements revealed that the Ag nanoparticles are highly crystalline. The antibacterial activity of the Ag nanoparticles-nanocellulose nanocomposites against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungus was evaluated. The results indicated that the silver nanoparticles-nanocellulose have high bactericidal efficiency against both bacteria and fungus.",

The X-ray energy spectra as a fingerprint of the plastic evidence is proposed to identify non-destructively the plastic evidence. The parallel capillary X-ray lens (PCXRL) is designed, and the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer based on the PCXRL and the laboratory X-ray source is developed to obtain the X-ray energy spectra as the fingerprint of the plastic evidence. The minimum detection limit of this X-ray fluorescence spectrometer is in the range of 1-35 ng/cm2. The diameter and the gain of full beam focused by the PCXRL are 3066 \u03bcm and 12.7 at 17.4 keV, respectively. There is a plateau where the distribution of the X-rays is uniform in the center of the focused beam. The diameter and the gain of this plateau is 570 \u03bcm and 47.5 at 17.4 keV, respectively. These are helpful to identify efficiently the plastic evidence with various sizes. The PCXRL has potential application in the identification technology for plastic evidence.",

This was helpful in measuring the XRF spectrum of a single aerosol particle in which the element distributions are not uniform. The minimum detection limit (MDL) of this Micro-XRF spectrometer was 15 ppm for the Fe-K\u03b1.

        "abstract": "The performances of capillary X-ray optics (CXRO) for confocal three-dimensional micro-X-ray fluorescence (3D Micro-XRF) technology are presented. In particular, the energy dependence of the collecting angle and input focal spot size of the polycapillary parallel X-ray lens (PPXRL), and the energy dependence of spatial resolution of the confocal 3D Micro-XRF spectrometer based on the CXRO are reported. In order to obtain the input focal spot size of the PPXRL, the source scan method was used. The size of the input focal spot of the PPXRL was 25.5 \u03bcm at 13 keV, and it was close to that of the output focal spot of a polycapillary focusing X-ray lens (PFXRL) at the same energy. The collecting angle of the PPXRL was 110 mrad at 10 keV, and it decreased with the increasing energies. The depth spatial resolution of the confocal 3D Micro-XRF spectrometer based on the CXRO was 29.3 \u03bcm at 17 keV, and it decreased with the increasing energies. The minimal detection limit of this confocal 3D Micro-XRF spectrometer was 101 ppm for the Ti-K\u03b1, when the operating voltage and current of the Mo X-ray tube were 36.0 kV and 800.0 \u03bcA, respectively. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that the properties of conical mono-capillary transmitting synchrotron radiation X-rays are different with ones transmitting divergence X-rays.",

        "abstract": "An energy dispersive micro X-ray diffractometer based on a combined system of two polycapillary X-ray lenses is designed. The polycapillary X-ray lens in the excitation channel is either a polycapillary parallel X-ray lens (PPXRL) or a slightly focusing polycapillary X-ray lens (SFPXRL). The polycapillary X-ray lens in the detection channel is a PPXRL.

The magnitude of the input focal spot size of a polycapillary X-ray lens is 10 \u03bcm and therefore, it is widely used in micro X-ray analysis [6\u201314] . The intense continuous spectrum and the parallel incident X-ray beam are necessary for energy dispersive X-ray diffraction. Bjeoumikhov et al. used a polycapillary focusing X-ray lens (PFXRL) in the excitation channel to carry out energy dispersive micro X-ray analysis [15] . There the intense beam and the small output focal spot size of the PFXRL is most efficiently utilized, but the larger convergence (about 160 mrad) of the X-ray beam focused by the PFXRL is not helpful in improving the total resolution of the diffractometer based on the PFXRL. In this paper, either a PPXRL or a SFPXRL is used in the excitation channel in order to improve the total resolution of the diffractometer, and a PPXRL is used in the detection channel to ensure that the diffractometer can carry out micro X-ray analysis. The performances of the diffractometer based on a PPXRL (or a SFPXRL) in the excitation channel and a PPXRL in the detection channel are studied. 2 Experiments and results 2.1 Performances of polycapillary optics for energy dispersive micro X-ray diffraction Fig. 1 schematically shows the realization of an energy dispersive micro X-ray diffractometer based on two PPXRLs. The divergence, i.e. primary beam divergence \u0394 \u03b8 p , of the 01-7-08 PPXRL is shown in Fig. 2 , which is measured using knife-edge scan method [16] . The decrease of the divergence of the PPXRL with higher energies results from the decrease of the critical angle with increasing energies. As shown in Fig. 3 , the transmission efficiency of the 01-7-08 PPXRL decreases at lower energies below about 7.0 keV. This can be explained by the increase of the absorption of the capillary channel wall and the glass inclusions that block the channels with the decrease of the energies. The transmission efficiency degradation with the increase of the energies above about 7.0 keV, is mainly caused by the decrease of the critical angle of total reflection at higher energies. The gain in power density of the 01-7-08 PPXRL is shown in Fig. 4 , which is measured using a pinhole with a diameter of 500.0 \u03bcm at the sample position with and without PPXRL. The gain in power density of the 02-7-10 PPXRL at 8.5 and 16.5 keV is 4.7 and 2.2 respectively. The secondary beam divergence \u0394 \u03b8 s is depended on the 02-7-10 PPXRL. The \u0394 \u03b8 s at 6.4 and 16.5 keV is 0.12 and 0.09 rad, respectively. The channels on the outside of the PPXRL have larger bending than those at the central part, and therefore, they have lower or zero transmission when the critical angle of total reflection is smaller at higher energies. This causes the decrease of \u0394 \u03b8 s with increasing energies. The input focal spot size of the 02-7-10 PPXRL at 8.5 and 16.5 keV is 33.1 and 24.8 \u03bcm respectively, which was measured using a source scan (an Oxford Ultra-Bright micro-focus W source, whose spot size was 15.0 \u03bcm). The decrease of the input focal spot size with the increasing energies is explained by the well-known 1/E energy dependence of the critical angle of total reflection of X-ray. Other parameters of the 01-7-08 and 02-7-10 PPXRL are shown in Table 1 . 2.2 Resolution of the energy dispersive micro X-ray diffractometer The X-ray source used in this experiment was a Mo rotating anode X-ray generator (RIGAKU RU-200, 60 kV\u2013200 mA). The detector system was an XFlash \u00ae Detector 2001 R\u00d6NTEC and R\u00d6NTEC MAX Spectrometer. The relative energy resolution of the detector system at E = 6.4 keV is \u0394 E / E = 0.14/6.4 = 0.022. The resolution of lattice spacing \u0394 d / d can be written as: (1) \u0394 d d = ( \u0394 \u03b8 ctg \u03b8 ) 2 + \u0394 E E 2 , where d = hc /2 E sin \u03b8 and \u0394 \u03b8 can be calculated by: (2) \u0394 \u03b8 = ( \u0394 \u03b8 p ) 2 + ( \u0394 \u03b8 s ) 2 . At 6.4 keV and 2 \u03b8 = 141.5\u00b0, the total resolution of the diffractometer based on a PPXRL in the excitation channel and a PPXRL in the detection channel in \u0394 d / d is 4.7%. Fig. 5 shows the diffraction spectrum of a 59.8 \u03bcm thick Mo sample measured using the diffractometer based on two PPXRLs. Measurement time was 120 s when the operating voltage and current of the X-ray tube was 35.0 kV and 90.0 mA, respectively. 2.3 Application of a SFPXRL in the energy dispersive micro X-ray diffractometer A SFPXRL, which is usually used in X-ray diffraction analysis [5,17,18] , can be used instead of the 01-7-08 PPXRL. The sample was placed in the output focal spot of the SFPXRL. The parameters of the 03-6-11 SFPXRL are shown in Table 2 . As shown in Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 4 , although the beam divergence after the output focal spot of SFPXRL, equaling the primary beam convergence \u0394 \u03b8 p , is larger than the primary beam divergence when the PPXRL is used, the gain in power density of the SFPXRL increases more highly. The total resolution of the diffractometer based on a SFPXRL in the excitation channel and a PPXRL in the detection channel in \u0394 d / d is 4.8%. This will reduce the measure time without large decreasing the total resolution of the diffractometer. Fig. 6 shows the diffraction spectrum of the Mo sample measured using the diffractometer based on a PPXRL and a SFPXRL. The X-ray source used here was a metal-ceramic X-ray tube (MCBM 50-0.6B) and a Mo anode with an about 50.0 \u03bcm spot. Measurement time was 180 s when the operating voltage and current of the X-ray tube was 35.0 kV and 800.0 \u03bcA. 3 Discussions The total resolution of the diffractometer based on a PFXRL in the excitation channel [15] and a combined system of two polycapillary X-ray lenses is about 6.1% and 4.7%, respectively. The reason for this difference between the total resolutions is that the total resolution of a diffractometer is improved with the decrease of the divergence of the incident beam as shown in Eqs. (1) and (2) . The gain in power density of a PPXRL is relatively low and therefore the X-ray source used in the diffractometer based on two PPXRLs is relatively power in order to obtain the spectra in little time. 4 Conclusions The smaller divergence of the incident beam collimated by either a PPXRL or a SFPXRL in the excitation channel is helpful in improving the total resolution of the diffractometer based on a combined system of two polycapillary X-ray lenses and moreover, a SFPXRL has a relatively large gain in power density. The energy dispersive micro X-ray diffractometer based on a SFPXRL in the excitation channel and a PPXRL in the detection channel has a potential application in X-ray analysis.

        "abstract": "A laboratory micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometer based on polycapillary X-ray optics (PXRO) was used to carry out the quantitative X-ray fluorescence analysis of single aerosol particles with smaller size than that of focal spot of PXRO. The minimum detection limits measured with the thin-film reference standards were in the range from 13.3 to 0.7 ng cm \u2212 2 when the operating current and voltage were 70 mA and 35 kV, respectively. In order to reduce the effects of the inhomogeneous distributions of the X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO on the analysis results, the sensitivities were corrected by using a Gaussian function for the quantitative analysis of single aerosol particles.

Keywords Micro X-ray fluorescence Capillary X-ray optics Single aerosol particle analysis 1 Introduction Quantitative X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of individual aerosol particles is a useful method for the studies on performances of aerosol particles [1,2] . There are many instruments which may be used to carry out the quantitative XRF analysis of individual aerosol particles, such as electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPXMA), laser mass microanalysis (LAMMA), synchrotron micro X-ray fluorescence (SMXRF), micro proton-induced X-ray emission (Micro-PIXE) and laboratory micro X-ray fluorescence (MXRF) spectrometer [1\u20138] . The existing laboratory MXRF spectrometer is often based on polycapillary X-ray optics (PXRO) [6\u20138] , and moreover, this optics is often used in the SMXRF facilities [2,9] . When the size of particle is larger than that of the focal spot of PXRO, the method of quantitative analysis of single aerosol particles using PXRO is mature [2,6] . However, when the size of particle is smaller than that of the focal spot of the PXRO, there are some difficulties in quantitatively analyzing such single aerosol particles using the PXRO with standard sample. The reasons of this are as follows. When the MXRF facilities based on the PXRO are calibrated with standard sample, the size of the focal spot of the PXRO is smaller than that of the standard sample. When concentrations of elements in a single aerosol particle with smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO were obtained using the sensitivities determined from standard sample, the sensitivities must be corrected according to the size and the shape of a single aerosol particle. And furthermore, it is well known that the distribution of the X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO is a Gaussian distribution. This is not helpful in accurately measuring the elemental XRF spectrum of a single aerosol particle with a smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO. The element distributions even in such a small single particle are not uniform. Experimental results indicate that the elemental XRF spectrum of such a small single aerosol particle will vary when the aerosol particle is placed at different positions in the focal spot of the PXRO, and this variation of the elemental XRF spectrum increases with the increasing size of aerosol particles [10] . And therefore, in order to obtain the average concentration of elements in a single particle, the Gaussian distribution in the focal spot of the PXRO must be taken into account when the sensitivities are corrected with the size and the shape of a single aerosol particle. In the present paper, the performances of the PXRO for carrying out the quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles with smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO are studied. We used a Gaussian function to correct the sensitivities obtained from standard sample with larger size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO according to the shapes and sizes of individual aerosol particles under consideration. As an example of the application of the PXRO in quantitative analysis of single aerosol particles, the single particles of soil dust and dust from construction field in the micron size range are analyzed. 2 Experimental setup Fig.\u00a01 schematically shows the realization of the MXRF spectrometer based on the PXRO. The X-ray source is a Mo rotating anode X-ray generator (RIGAKU RU-200, 60 kV\u2013200 mA) whose spot size is 300 \u00d7 300 \u03bcm 2 . In order to obtain a monochromatic excitation, a Nb filter with a thickness of 77.4 \u03bcm was added between the PXRO and the sample. The detector system is an XFlash \u00ae Detector 2001 R\u00d6NTEC and R\u00d6NTEC MAX Spectrometer. The energy resolution of this detector system at 5.9 keV is 140 eV. The working distance of the electronic video microscope is 95 mm. The maximum total magnification of this microscope is 486. This microscope provides the function of size measurement based on the method of staff gauge. The size of the particle is measured with this microscope. The focal spot size of the PXRO decreases with the increasing energies, and the energy dependence of the focal spot size for the PXRO can be measured by using the backscatter method [11] . In this experiment the monochromatic excitation of Mo\u2013K\u03b1 was used, and the focal spot size of the PXRO for Mo\u2013K\u03b1 is 30.5 \u03bcm. The gain of the power flux density in the focal spot of the PXRO can be calculated by the following: (1) g a i n = \u03b7 ( E ) \u22c5 ( L f in ) 2 \u22c5 ( D in D spot ) 2 where \u03b7 ( E ) is the measured transmission efficiency of the PXRO at energy E , which can be measured by using a pinhole [11] , L is the distance from the X-ray source to the focal spot of the PXRO, f in is the input focal distance of the PXRO, D in and D spot are the diameter of the entrance and the focal spot of the PXRO, respectively. The gain of the PXRO for Mo\u2013K\u03b1 is 2970. Other parameters of the PXRO are reported in Table\u00a01 . 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Minimum detection limits of MXRF spectrometer based on PXRO The minimum detection limits (MDLs) can be calculated by the following formula\u00a0 [12] : (2) M D L = 3 \u22c5 C i \u22c5 I i , B I i , N \u22c5 t where C i is the concentration of element i in the standard sample, I i ,B and I i ,N are the measured background and characteristic X-ray intensity of element i in counts per second, respectively, t is the acquisition time in live seconds. The MDLs of the MXRF spectrometer based on the PXRO are reported in Table\u00a02 , which were measured using a series of thin-film reference standards (Micromatter, Seattle, WA, USA). These thin-film reference standards are prepared by vacuum deposition resulting in a highly uniform deposit. They are deposited on the Mylar film with a thickness of 6 \u03bcm. In order to reduce the effects of the possible inhomogeneous element distributions of this thin-film reference standards on the analysis results, we repeated the measurements of the standard reference samples with the focal spot of the PXRO locating at 15 different positions on the thin-film reference standards, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated ( Table\u00a02 ). According to the RSD in Table\u00a02 , the thin-film reference standards may be used for the reference standard for the MXRF analysis. The possible method of lowering the MDLs of the MXRF spectrometer based on a PXRO is to place a specially designed polycapillary X-ray collimator (PXRC) in the detection channel [9] . This will improve the signal-to-noise ratio because of the restriction of the detector field of view by the PXRC, and accordingly lower the MDLs of the laboratory spectrometer based on a PXRO. 3.2 Calibration for MXRF spectrometer based on PXRO For the quantification, we used backscatter fundamental parameter method of QXAS package [13] . In order to establish the calibration constants for scattered radiation, a series of metal foils is used, such as Al, V, Fe, Ni, Cu, Y, Sn and Ta. In order to calculate the calibration constant for fluorescence radiation, the thin-film reference standards mentioned above were used. The measurements were performed in air. Fig.\u00a02 shows an example of the XRF spectrum of reference standard of Fe. The resulting sensitivity coefficients as a function of element are shown in Fig.\u00a03 . The calibration procedure was evaluated by analyzing the standard samples prepared by pipetting standard solutions on the Mylar film with a thickness of 6 \u03bcm with ordinary pipette equipment. The standard solutions are a series of commercial single element reference standards. The accuracy of our measurement is on average 16% depending on the element and concentration. The precision of our analysis is better than 1.5% for most of the elements, with exception of Si, for which it is about 3.7%. 3.3 Application of the PXRO in quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles The integral sensitivity coefficient (ISC) is defined here as the sensitivity coefficient obtained by using the full excitation X-rays in the focal spot of the PXRO. The differential sensitivity coefficient (DSC) is defined here as the sensitivity coefficient corresponding to the fractional part of the excitation X-rays in the focal spot of the PXRO. The DSC will be modulated by the distribution of the excitation X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO. When the laboratory MXRF spectrometer based on the PXRO is used to carry out the quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles with smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO, the DSC should be used. However, there were difficulties in obtaining the DSC through direct measurement. The ISC may be used here instead of DSC to carry out the quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles with smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO, but it must be corrected by the distribution of the excitation X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO, the position of particle under consideration in the focal spot of the PXRO, and the shape and size of the analyzed particle. Considering that the distribution of the excitation X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO is a Gaussian distribution, the ISC was corrected via the two-dimensional Gaussian function according to shapes and sizes of individual particle whose center is placed at the center of focal spot of the PXRO: (3) D S C = I S C \u22c5 \u222c D 1 2 \u03c0 \u22c5 \u03c3 \u22c5 e \u2212 x 2 + z 2 2 \u03c3 2 d x d z where \u03c3 could be obtained by using a wire scan or the derivation of a knife edge scan, and D is dependent on the shape and the size of the individual particle under consideration. In our study, the shape of the analyzed particle was assumed to be spherical or ellipsoidal, and the corresponding equations of D are the following Eqs.\u00a0 (4) and (5) , respectively: (4) x 2 + z 2 = ( D 2 ) 2 (5) x 2 A 2 + z 2 B 2 = 1. The diameter D of the particle-sphere, the large half-axis A and small half-axis B of the particle-ellipsoid were estimated using the electronic video microscope. In order to evaluate the accuracy and the precision of our method, a series of standard solution drops with a smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO was analyzed, respectively. Such small standard solution drops were collected on the Mylar film with a thickness of 6 \u03bcm daubed with the mixture of pure petroleum jelly (manufactured in USA) and C 6 H 5 CH 3 with special pipette equipment made in our laboratory with taper glass monocapillary whose output diameter is 2 \u03bcm, which is different from pipette equipment used in Section\u00a03.2 . The accuracy of the analysis of these single standard solution drops was on average 25% depending on the element and concentration. The precision of the analysis was better than 5%. For example, when a standard solution drop with a diameter 3.8 \u03bcm is analyzed, the accuracies of the analysis of Cr and Ni were 13.7% and 11.3%, respectively. Their precisions were 2.5% and 1.9%, respectively. For sampling, a Battelle-type cascade impactor which has eight size-fractionated stages with the size range of < 0.25, 0.25\u20130.5, 0.5\u20131, 1\u20132, 2\u20134, 4\u20138, 8\u201316 and > 16 \u03bcm, respectively was used. In every range, the aerosol particles are collected on the Mylar film with a thickness of 6 \u03bcm daubed with the mixture of pure petroleum jelly (manufactured in USA) and C 6 H 5 CH 3 . Because this sample will be analyzed in a single particle respectively, the sample time must be controlled so that the aerosol particles were well separated with minimum separation distance greater than the excitation source beam diameter. As an example of the application of the MXRF spectrometer based on PXRO in the quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles, the particles of soil dust and dust from construction field with the size range of 0.5\u20131 \u03bcm and 2\u20134 \u03bcm respectively are analyzed. The soil dust samples were collected from the open lands from where windblown soil dust could be transported. The dusts in the construction field were mainly from the cement. They were collected from the construction field. All samples of soil dust and dust from construction field were air dried and ground and then placed respectively in a sealed container with an exit and an inlet. When the wind is insufflated into the container through its inlet by a blower, the single particles can be collected on the Mylar film with a thickness of 6 \u03bcm by the Battelle-type cascade impactor placed at the exit the container. Figs.\u00a04 and 5 show the XRF spectra of a single aerosol particle of soil dust and dust from construction field, respectively. In the case of soil dust and dust from construction field, a density of 1.5 g/cm 3 and 1.7 g/cm 3 was assumed, respectively. As shown in Table\u00a03 , the concentrations of particles from various sources are different. These elemental compositions may be considered as the chemical fingerprint of the single aerosol particles for air pollution sources, and the size-resolved fingerprint database for the air pollution sources may be accordingly established based on the quantitative XRF results for single aerosol particles. The origin of single aerosol particles can be identified by the comparison between the elemental compositions of unknown single aerosol particles and those of single aerosol particles from air pollution sources. And therefore, the size-resolved aerosol apportionment may be carried out based on the quantitative XRF results for single aerosol particles. In our work, there are some factors that will affect the accuracy of our method of quantitative XRF analysis of single aerosol particles. In order to obtain a monochromatic excitation, the metal filter is used. The monochromaticity of the monochromatic excitation obtained with this filter method is lower than that of the monochromatic excitation obtained with the secondary target and crystal, respectively. And therefore, for higher accuracy, the method of obtaining the monochromatic excitation with secondary target or crystal may be used. In our study, the shape of the analyzed particle was assumed to be spherical or ellipsoidal. In fact, there are few aerosol particles with a right spherical or ellipsoidal shape. In addition, the accuracy of our method of quantitative XRF analysis also relies on the method of estimating the diameter of the aerosol particle with the electronic video microscope. 4 Conclusions The order of magnitude of the gain in power density of the PXRO with a relative small focal spot was 10 3 . This is helpful for the analysis of small sample. But the Gaussian distribution of X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO is not helpful for the quantitative analysis of a single particle with a smaller size than that of the focal spot of the PXRO. When the MXRF spectrometer based on the PXRO is used to quantitatively analyze such single particles, in order to reduce the effects of the inhomogeneous distributions of the X-ray intensity in the focal spot of the PXRO on the analysis results, the sensitivities may be corrected by using a Gaussian function according to the shape and size of a single particle under consideration.

        "abstract": "The divergence of the beam focused by polycapillary X-ray optics (PXRO) varied at different distances from the exit of the PXRO. This distance dependence of the divergence of the PXRO was defined as the fine structures of the divergence of the PXRO. The fine structures of the divergence of the PXRO were presented in order to use them fully. There were main three types of the PXRO, such as polycapillary parallel X-ray lens (PPXRL), polycapillary focusing X-ray lens (PFXRL) and polycapillary slightly focusing X-ray lens (PSFXRL). For the PPXRL, the divergence decreased near its exit. The reason for this might be that the divergence near the exit of the PPXRL depended mainly on the X-rays traversing directly through the monocapillaries in the center of the PPXRL without total reflection. For the PFXRL and PSFXRL, they both had respectively a focal depth over which the beam sizes at different output distances remained acceptably small. For the 8 keV X-rays, the focal depth and divergence over the focal depth of the PFXRL were about 300 \u03bcm and 25.0 mrad, respectively. At the same energy of 8 keV, the focal depth and divergence over the focal depth of the PSFXRL were about 500 \u03bcm and 12.5 mrad, respectively. The divergence of the PFXRL and the PSFXRL depended mainly on the angles between axes of monocapillaries that composed them. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The confocal x-ray scattering method based on x-ray capillary optics was proposed to nondestructively measure the inner and outer diameters of the monocapillary. The positions of the boundaries of monocapillary x-ray optics were determined by a knife-edge scanning method, and the x-ray optics were profiled in two planes or in three-dimensional space accordingly. This confocal method could conveniently give the inner surface topography of the monocapillary optics, which can be used to show the difference between the actual inner surface and the theoretical one, and has potential applications in nondestructive measurements of stratified substances, or the profile morphology of a specific interface.",

The MGPXRC is composed of 105 capillaries with an inner diameter of several microns. The divergent X-ray beam emitted from X-ray source became a quasi-parallel beam after collimated by MGPXRC. The quasi-parallel beam size is related to the focal spot size of X-ray source. Therefore, the focal spot size of X-ray source can be obtained by using the linear fit based on the quasi-parallel beam size at various distance from the output of the MGPXRC. The focal spot size of a micro X-ray source was measured by using the MGPXRC method and conventional pinhole imaging method, and the measured results are 60.8 and 59.4 \u03bcm, respectively. The MGPXRC can be used to measure the focal spot size of X-ray source with a larger emitting angle than the critical angle of the total reflection of X-rays. And the MGPXRC method has a potential application in the measurement of X-ray source with a spot size of a submicron or even smaller.",

A micro-XRF spectrometer based on a monolithic capillary X-ray lens (MCXRL) and laboratory X-ray source is designed in order to carry out the XRF analysis of single aerosol particles. The order of magnitude of the gain of power density of the MCXRL is 103 at the focal spot, and the focal spot size of the MCXRL is about 30\u03bcm. The minimum detection limit (MDL) of this spectrometer is 0.7 pg for the Fe-K\u03b1. The XRF spectrum of a single aerosol particle with a diameter of 9\u03bcm is obtained within 180 s when the working voltage and current of a Mo rotating anode X-ray generator are 30 kV and 50 mA, respectively.

        "title": "Characterization of a polycapillary focusing X-ray lens for application in spatially resolved EXAFS experiments",
        "abstract": "A dispersive extended-X-ray-absorption-fine-structure (EXAFS) spectrometer based on a polycapillary focusing X-ray lens (PFXRL), a position-sensitive proportional counter and a rotating anode X-ray source is designed. When the working voltage and current of a Mo rotating anode X-ray generator are 25 kV and 100 mA, respectively, it takes 6 h to obtain the EXAFS spectrum of the Cu film. The experiments show that a dispersive EXAFS spectrometer based on a PFXRL can be applied in spatially resolved EXAFS analysis. A PFXRL can efficiently collect a relatively large solid angle of X-ray beams from a X-ray source and focus them to form a micro spot for X-ray analysis. The magnitudes of the output focal spot size and the gain of the PFXRL are 10 \u03bcm and 10 3 , respectively, and therefore, it is widely used in micro X-ray analysis [1\u20136] . In order to study the application of a PFXRL in time resolved EXAFS experiments [7] , we previously used a PFXRL to focus the X-rays generated by femtosecond laser driven plasma, and studied the time-smearing and other properties of the X-ray pulses focused by the PFXRL [8] . In this Letter, we first obtained the EXAFS spectrum by using a dispersive EXAFS spectrometer based on a PFXRL. In this Letter, we present the properties of the dispersive micro-EXAFS spectrometer based on a PFXRL. The energy dependence of focal spot size for the PFXRL used in our experiment is shown in Fig. 1 . The decrease of the focal spot size of the PFXRL with the increasing energies mainly results from the decrease of the critical angle of total reflection with higher energies. Fig. 2 shows the measured transmission efficiency as a function of X-ray energy for the PFXRL. As shown in Fig. 2 , the transmission efficiency decreases at lower energies below about 6.2 keV. This can be explained by the increase of the absorption of the capillary channel wall and the glass inclusions that block the channels with the decrease of the energies. The transmission efficiency degradation with the increasing energies above about 6.2 keV, is mainly caused by the decrease of the critical angle of total reflection at higher energies. The divergence \u0394 \u03b8 (as shown in Fig. 3 ) of the beam after focal spot of the PFXRL is 5.5\u00b0 and 3.8\u00b0 at 8.0 and 16.0 keV, respectively, which is measured by using a backscatter method [9] . Other parameters of the PFXRL are shown in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 , the output focal distance of the PFXRL increases slightly with increasing energy, which is measured by using an axial scanning method [10] . At higher energies, the increase of output focal distance and the decrease of the divergence of the beam after focal spot are all explained by the well-known 1/ E energy dependence of the critical angle of total reflection. The PSPC made in Germany consists of a platinum wire with a 20 \u03bcm diameter and two insulated half-cathodes with a 50 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 0.4 mm Beryllium window. The PSPC is operated at an anode voltage of 3.6 kV. P-10 gas (90% argon + 10% methane) at a working pressure of 7.5 bar was used in the flow mode. The spatial resolution of the PSPC was measured as 72 \u03bcm by using a pair of narrow slits. The energy resolution \u0394 E of the spectrometer is expressed as (1) \u0394 E ( FWHM ) = d E d X \u00b7 \u0394 X ( FWHM ) , where \u0394 X is the half-width of an X-ray peak observed in the position spectrum of the PSPC. The extent of an X-ray line in the position spectrum is induced by three factors: the position resolution W of the PSPC, size \u0394 S of the X-ray beam spot on the sample and imperfections of the crystal. As shown in Fig. 3 , the \u0394 X can be written as (2) \u0394 X = W 2 + ( \u0394 S ) 2 + ( \u0394 \u03b8 \u00d7 BC ) 2 where only the intrinsic angular width \u0394 \u03b8 of the crystal is taken into account. (3) \u0394 \u03b8 = 2 e 2 mc 2 \u03bb 2 \u03c0 V F hkl sin ( 2 \u03b8 c ) sin ( \u03b8 c + \u03b5 ) sin ( \u03b8 c - \u03b5 ) where F hkl is the real part of the structure factor for the hkl reflection, V is the volume of the unit cell, e 2 / mc 2 is the classical electron radius and \u03b5 is the angle of inclination of the diffracting lattice plane to the surface of the crystal. According to the Bragg law and detection geometry shown in Fig. 3 , there is the following: (4) sin \u03b8 = 12 400 2 d \u00d7 E (5) X = ( AB + BC ) \u00d7 tan ( \u03b8 c - \u03b8 ) The d E /d X can be obtained from Eqs. (4) and (5) as follows: (6) d E d X = E 2 E crystal \u00d7 cos 2 \u03b8 c AB + BC 1 - E crystal E 2 3 2 - 2 E sin \u03b8 c \u00d7 cos \u03b8 c ( AB + BC ) \u00d7 1 + E crystal E 2 + E crystal \u00d7 sin 2 \u03b8 c AB + BC 1 - E crystal E 2 1 2 where \u03b8 is the Bragg angle, E is the X-ray energy in eV, d is the lattice constant of the crystal in \u00c5, AB and BC is the optical path in mm, and E crystal = 12 400/2 d in eV is the lowest energy which can be dispersed by a given crystal. As can be seen from Eq. (6) that the energy resolution of the spectrometer becomes worse as the detected E increase and one could improve it for higher energy X-rays by choosing a crystal with smaller lattice constant. The energy resolution becomes better with the increase of AB and/or BC , as seen from Eq. (6) . The energy resolution of the spectrometer based on the PFXRL is 10.4 eV for the WL a1 line when the LiF(2 2 0) is used. The energy resolution of the micro-EXAFS spectrometer based on the PFXRL can be further improved by using a high index diffraction planes with smaller crystal plane spacing and a charge coupled devices (CCD) with high spatial resolution. The transmission efficiency of the PFXRL decreases from about 11.3% to about 0.53% in the energy range of 7\u201320 keV. This indicates that the PFXRL can be used as a filter for high energies, which is helpful in avoiding higher harmonics (such as from LiF(4 4 0) in this experiment). Consequently, intense X-rays are available over a wide energy range by applying high accelerating voltage to the X-ray tube. A schematic experimental set-up for measuring EXAFS spectra using a PFXRL, a PSPC and a rotating anode X-ray source is shown in Fig. 3 . The sample is placed in the focal spot of the PFXRL. When the working voltage and current of a Mo rotating anode X-ray generator (RIGAKU RU-200, 60 kV to 200 mA) are 25 kV and 100 mA, respectively, it takes 6 h to obtain the EXAFS spectrum of the Cu film with a 12-\u03bcm thickness at room temperature by using LiF(2 2 0), which is shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 5 shows the Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of the Cu film. In this experiment, the signal-noise ratio of the detector system is about 122. A dispersive EXAFS spectrometer based on a PFXRL and various X-ray sources can be applied in the area of EXAFS including absorption studies of small sample, spatially resolved EXAFS and time resolved EXAFS.

        "abstract": "The confocal micro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) based on polycapillary X-ray lens and conventional X-ray source was used to carry out the scanning analysis of the distribution of the elements in a single hair. The elemental distribution in the single hair was obtained. In the confocal micro XRF technology, the output focal spot of the polycapillary focusing X-ray lens and the input focal spot of the polycapillary parallel X-ray lens were adjusted confocally. The detector could only detect the X-rays from the overlapping foci. This confocal structure decreased the effects of the background on the X-ray spectra, and was accordingly helpful for improving the accuracy of this XRF technology. A polycapillary focusing X-ray lens with a high gain in power density was used to decrease the requirement of power of the X-ray source used in this confocal technology, and made it possible to perform such confocal micro XRF analysis by using the conventional X-ray source with low cost. Experimental results indicated that the confocal micro X-ray fluorescence based on polycapillary X-ray lens had potential applications in analyzing the elemental distribution of individual hairs.",

When the pheromone accumulated to the backtracking point on the tour, pheromone will be backtracked in the improved algorithm. The improved algorithm not only solves the ACO algorithm in excessive accumulation of pheromone problems, but also has better global search ability and convergence speed, which increase the quality of the solution space by using the information of the previous iterations' ants. Finally, the improved algorithm is applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP), and the simulation results show that it is much better than basic ACO algorithm in many aspects, such as the optimal iterations, the average and the optimal solution etc.",

One of the disadvantages of our polycapillary optics is that it has low transmission efficiency to the high energy X-ray. However, it is beneficial to measure the chemical compositions of rich Pb sample. In this paper, we reported the performances of a tabletop setup of micro-X-ray fluorescence system base on slightly focusing polycapillary and its applications for analysis of rich Pb sample. A piece of Chinese ancient over-glaze porcelain was analyzed by micro-X-ray fluorescence. The experimental results showed that the Cu, Fe and Mn are the major color elements.

Using this new cone collimation system, scattering angle 2\u03b8 has a theoretical minimum angle related to the mean half-opening angle of the hollow cone beam of 1.42 mrad, and with the usable X-ray energy ranging from 4 to 30 keV, the resulting observable scattering vector q is down to a minimum value of about 0.003 \u00c5 (or a Bragg spacing of about 2100 \u00c5). However, the absorption of lower energies by X-ray capillary optics, sample transmission, and detector response function limits the application range to lower energy. Cone collimation ED-SAXS experiments carried out on pure water, Lupolen, and in situ temperature-dependent measurement of diacetylenic acid/melamine micelle solid were presented at three different scattering angles 2\u03b8 of 0.18\u00b0, 0.70\u00b0 and 1.18\u00b0 to illustrate the new opportunities offered by this technique as well as its limitations. Also, a comparison has been made by replacing the PPXRL with a pinhole, and the result shows that cone collimation ED-SAXS based on ESBC with PPXRL was helpful in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., reducing the parasitic background scattering) than ESBC with a pinhole. The cone collimation instrument based on X-ray capillary optics could be considered as a promising tool to perform SAXS experiments, especially cone collimation ED-SAXS has potential application for the in situ temperature-dependent studying on the kinetics of phase transitions.",

A calibration curve for the Rayleigh to Compton scattering intensity ratio and effective atomic number was constructed on the basis of a reliable physical model for X-ray scattering. The content of light elements, which are \"invisible\" using X-ray fluorescence, can be calculated \"by difference\" from the calibration curve. In this work, we demonstrated the use of this proposed approach to identify complex organic matrices in different vegetable oils with high precision and accuracy. ",

The ESBC was employed to focus the X-rays from a conventional laboratory source into a small focal spot and to produce an annular X-ray beam in the far-field. Additionally, diffracted polychromatic X-rays were confocally collected by the PPXRL attached to a stationary energy-resolved detector. Our FCG method based on ESBC and PPXRL had achieved relatively high intensity diffraction peaks and effectively narrowed the diffraction peak width which was helpful in improving the potential d-spacing resolution for material phase analysis.",

A calibration curve of the relationship between  I Co  / I Ra   and  Z eff   was established by using a set of 8 SiC calibration samples. The sensitivity of this approach is so high that it can be easily distinguished samples of  Z eff   differing from each other by only 0.01. The linear relationship between the variation of  Z eff   and the variations of contents of C, Si and O of SiC ceramics were found, and the corresponding calculation model of the relationship between the \u0394Z and the \u0394C C , \u0394C Si , and \u0394C O  were established. The variation of contents of components of the tested SiC ceramics after oxidation at high temperature was quantitatively calculated based on the model. It was shown that the results of contents of carbon, silicon and oxygen obtained by this method were in good agreement with the results obtained by XPS, giving values of relative deviation less than 1%. It was concluded that the practicality of this proposed method for monitoring of the oxidation situation of SiC ceramics at high temperatures was acceptable.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Confocal three-dimensional micro X-ray fluorescence (3D MXRF) is an excellent surface analysis technology. For a confocal structure, only the X-rays from the confocal volume can be detected. Confocal 3D MXRF has been widely used for analysing elements, the distribution of elements and 3D image of some special samples. However, it has rarely been applied to analysing surface topography by surface scanning. In this paper, a confocal 3D MXRF technology based on polycapillary X-ray optics was proposed for determining surface topography. A corresponding surface adaptive algorithm based on a progressive approximation method was designed to obtain surface topography. The surface topography of the letter \u201cR\u201d on a coin of the Peopleu0027s Republic of China and a small pit on painted pottery were obtained. The surface topography of the \u201cR\u201d and the pit are clearly shown in the two figures. Compared with the method in our previous study, it exhibits a higher scanning efficiency. This approach could be used for two-dimensional (2D) elemental mapping or 3D elemental voxel mapping measurements as an auxiliary method. It also could be used for analysing elemental mapping while obtaining the surface topography of a sample in 2D elemental mapping measurement.",

TBMXO is consists of two parts: an ellipsoidal part and a tapered part. Before experimental testing, the TBMXO was simulated by the ray tracing method in MATLAB. The simulated results predicted that the proposed TBMXO would produce a smaller focal spot with higher power-density gain than the ellipsoidal monocapillary X-ray optic (EMXO). In the experiment, the TBMXO performance was tested by both an optical device and a Cu target X-ray tube with focal spot of 100    \u03bc   m. The results indicated that the TBMXO had a slope error of 57.6    \u03bc   rad and a 13.1    \u03bc   m focal spot and a 1360 gain in power density were obtained.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Conventional polycapillary X-ray lenses are fabricated using an arrangement of hollow cylindrical tubes (i.e., capillaries) in a hexagonal structure, which necessarily includes triangular-shaped non-functional spaces between the capillaries. These non-functional spaces reduce the transmission efficiency of the lens, and can also affect the utilization of the pixels of charge-coupled devices in imaging applications. These disadvantages can be overcome by adopting a polycapillary X-ray lens structure with a square cross-section fabricated from a square matrix array of capillaries, each with equivalent square cross-sections. We develop a mathematical model of a square poly-capillary X-ray lens, and also present a simulation-driven numerical method for calculating the X-ray transmission efficiency, intensity distribution of the exit plane and the focal spot based on a ray-tracing technique.",

The ESBC optic effectively focused a large focal spot X-ray source into a smaller focal spot and produced a narrowed X-ray ring in the far-field pattern when combined with a beam stop. A CCD imaging detector was linearly translated along the principal axis of the ESBC-FCG and obtained the corresponding sequential images of diffraction concentric circular caustics and convergence points, which were formed by the constructive interference of a continuous set of Debye cones arising from the annular interrogation volume. Pixels from the central region of an approximately 0.6\u2005mm2 area were interrogated on each sequential image; as a result, a one-dimensional diffractogram of an aluminium oxide sample was revealed. The presented ESBC-FCG ADXRD technique shows potential for increasing the diffracted intensity and streamlining the operation of crystallographic analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Lithological recognition is of great significance in oil drilling fields. To investigate the relationship between rock properties and the vibro-acoustic signal characteristics generated by drilling, a rock drilling vibration measurement system has been developed, and a relative drilling test is conducted indoors. This paper illustrates the application of a vibration sensor and a special wideband acoustic sensor method to distinguish the specific time\u2013frequency characteristics generated by drilling in different types of rock. Furthermore, an intuitive comparison of these two approaches is performed. In particular, an acoustic focusing device was designed to assist the wideband acoustic condenser microphone in detecting specific signals during the drilling process. In addition, time-domain and time\u2013frequency analyses were proposed to reveal the differences in signal characteristics generated by different kinds of rock. The results indicate that both the vibration spectral characteristics and the acoustic spectral characteristics from 4 types of rock show significant differences, which may be promising for lithological recognition using the feature model. However, the acoustic sensor approach, benefiting from the specially designed acoustic focusing device, presents a better signal-to-noise ratio than the vibration sensor approach.",

This paper explores a quantitative analysis method that can be applied to solid samples. Fluorescence spectra of liquid samples are obtained on a 3D confocal x-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Curves are plotted showing the relationships between the fluorescence count intensity and the mass percentage of metal ions, and the respective fitting-curve equations are determined according to the curve morphology. Fluorescence intensity as a function of the mass percentage and depth position is derived from the samples for a particular acquisition time. These data play a potential role in the subsequent quantitative analysis of unknown mass percentages of solid samples.",

Painted pottery from this period is famous for its exquisite workmanship and meticulous painting. Studying the layer structure and element distribution of the paint on the pottery is conducive to investigating its workmanship, which is important for archaeological research. However, the most common analysis methods are destructive. To investigate the layers of paint on the pottery nondestructively, a confocal three-dimensional micro-X-ray fluorescence set-up combined with two individual polycapillary lenses has been used to analyse two painted pottery fragments. Nondestructive elemental depth analyses and surface topographic analysis were performed. The elemental depth profiles of Mn, Fe and Ca obtained from these measurements were consistent with those obtained using an optical microscope. The depth profiles show that there are layer structures in two samples. The images show that the distribution of Ca is approximately homogeneous in both painted and unpainted regions. In contrast, Mn appeared only in the painted regions. Meanwhile, the distributions of Fe in the painted and unpainted regions were not the same. The surface topographic shows that the pigment of dark-brown region was coated above the brown region. These conclusions allowed the painting process to be inferred.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Conventional polycapillary X-ray lenses, which are important components of widely used X-ray optics, are very suitable for focusing or parallelling the X-rays. However, for the hexagonal arrangement of the capillary, there are some shortcomings when it is used for X-ray imaging. Although, these shortcomings can be overcome by adopting a polycapillary X-ray lens structure with a square cross-section fabricated from a square matrix array of capillaries, it is challenging to manufacture it. In this paper, we present a new type of X-ray optics: a square polycapillary slice, which is 3\u00a0mm thick. It is like a sheet and consists of    1080  \u00d7  1080    square arrayed square micro-channels. Each external wall of a square micro-channel can be approximately expressed as a paraboloid. To study its optical properties, we conducted both simulation and experimental measurements. The simulated results showed that the focal distances of the cases in which the square polycapillary slice had no fluctuations and had fluctuations were 36.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 and 36.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0mm, respectively. The measured focal distance was 36.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0mm. The full widths of the simulated focal spot of the cases in which the square polycapillary slice had no fluctuations and had fluctuations were 621 and    657    \u03bc  m   , respectively. The full width of the measured focal spot was    600    \u03bc  m   . The centre area of the focal spot was star-like. Its optical properties were similar to those of the polycapillary X-ray lens. Because the micro-channels are squared arrayed, it is more suitable for X-ray imaging than conventional polycapillary X-ray lens.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The online measurement of the solid phase in sand\u2013water two-phase flows is significant in industrial production processes, especially for oil production in old oilfields. To improve the existing limitations in the detection of dilute solid particles in solid\u2013liquid conveying systems, an acoustic sensor approach for sand detection in sand\u2013water flows is developed and evaluated. This paper reports the application of a special acoustic sensor device to quantitatively survey sand\u2013water flows in a pipeline. In this work, an acoustic focusing component is designed to assist a condenser microphone in detecting the sand signals. A time\u2013frequency analysis method and characteristic sand frequency multiband digital filter method are presented to enhance the sand detection in water flows with strong background noise. Additionally, the real-time sand mass flow rate is calculated to check the quantitative analysis results for the monitored sand information. Furthermore, the calibrated reference sand signals are used to reduce the uncertainty in each measurement. An experimental investigation considers sand\u2013water flows with sand contents ranging from 0.0292\u20130.204\u00a0wt% and sand sizes of 180\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm. To verify the reliability and accuracy of our acoustic sand detection method, two regions with different test conditions are examined. The results show that there is a good correlation (less than \u00b1\u00a015% uncertainty in bends and less than \u00b1\u00a010% uncertainty in impact regions) between the acoustic power spectrum and sand mass flow rate. Accordingly, the acoustic sensor approach can help to enhance the detection of the dilute solid phase in solid\u2013fluid conveying systems, laying the foundation for quantitative particle detection in more complex multiphase flows.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show that as the reaction proceeds, ZnAl2O4 changes from the initial (111)-oriented single crystal to poly-crystal, and then to inadequate (111) orientation. Corresponding scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicate that the surface morphology of ZnAl2O4 transforms from uniform islands to stick structures, and then to bulgy-line structures. In addition, XRD spectra present that ZnAl2O4 prepared at low temperature is unstable at the environment of higher temperature. On the as-obtained ZnAl2O 4/\u03b1-Al2O3 substrates, GaN films were grown without any nitride buffer using light-radiation heating low-pressure MOCVD (LRH-LP-MOCVD). XRD spectra indicate that GaN film on this kind of complex substrate changes from c-axis single crystal to poly-crystal as ZnAl 2O4 layer is thickened. For the single crystal GaN, its full width at half maximum (FWHM) of X-ray rocking curve is 0.4\u00b0. Results indicate that islands on thin ZnAl2O4 layer can promote nucleation at initial stage of GaN growth, which leads to the (0001)-oriented GaN film.",

It is found that the hydrogen storage capacity can be as large as 18.6, 10.5, 9.9 and 9.5 wt% with average adsorption energy of about -0.27, -0.36, -0.76 and -0.70 eV/H 2 for Li, Ca, Sc, Ti decorated graphyne, respectively. The results suggest potential candidates for hydrogen storage at ambient condition. The adsorption mechanism for H2 on metal coated graphyne was mainly attributed to the polarization induced by electrostatic field of metal atoms on graphyne and the hybridization between the metal atoms and hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, the formation of super-molecules of hydrogen can enhance the adsorption energy. \u00a9 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "(ZrO2) x (SiO2)1-x (Zr-Si-O) films with different compositions were deposited on p-Si(100) substrates by using pulsed laser deposition technique. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) showed that these films remained amorphous after annealing at 800\u00b0C with RTA process in N2 for 60 s. The XPS spectra indicated that Zr-Si-O films with x=0.5 suffered no obvious phase separation after annealing at 800\u00b0C, and no interface layer was formed between Zr-Si-O film and Si substrate. While Zr-Si-O films with x >0.5 suffered phase separation to precipitate ZrO 2 after annealing under the same condition, and SiO2 was formed at the interface. To get a good interface between Zr-Si-O films and Si substrate, Zr-Si-O films with bi-layer structure (ZrO2) 0.7(SiO2)0.3/(ZrO2) 0.5(SiO2)0.5/Si was deposited. The electrical properties showed that the bi-layer Zr-Si-O film is of the lowest equivalent oxide thickness and good interface with Si substrate. \u00a9 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",

GaN films were then directly grown on this new kind of substrate using light-radiation heating low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (LRH-LP-MOCVD) without any nitride buffer layer. The structure and surface morphology of the ZnAl2O4/\u03b1 - Al2O3 substrates and GaN epilayers have been characterized by employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The result show that as the thickness of ZnAl2O4 layer is increased, the film changes from a (111)-oriented single crystal to a poly-crystal, together with the surface morphology transforms from uniform islands to the bulgy-line structure, leading to GaN films grown on ZnAl2O4/\u03b1 - Al2O3 substrates varying from c-axis oriented single-crystal to poly-crystal.",

Except the excellent dielectric properties, including a significant increase in dielectric constant as high as 27.2, a negative flatband voltage of -0.46 V, and a very small loop hysteresis, the YSH film has also shown an obvious response to magnetic field. The saturation magnetization of about 1.3 A m2 kg-1 and 5.8 A m2 kg-1 is presented from the YSH films at 300 K with parallel and perpendicular magnetic field, respectively, which is 20% and 9% larger than that of pure HfO2 film at corresponding magnetic field. It is an indicative approach to control the dielectric properties of hafnium-based oxide films with electric and/or magnetic operation. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics.",

The GaN and PZT films in the MFS structures have been characterized by various methods such as photoluminescence (PL), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The Electric properties of GaN MFS structure with different oxide thickness have been characterized by high-frequency C-V measurement. When the PZT films are as thick as 1 \u03bcm, the GaN active layers can approach inversion under the bias of 15V, which can not be observed in the traditional GaN MOS structures. When the PZT films are about 100 nm, the MFS structures can approach inversion just under 5V. All the marked improvements of C-V behaviors in GaN MFS structures are mainly attributed to the high dielectric constant and large polarization of the ferroelectric gate oxide.",

Quantitative calculation shows that the phase transition temperature, polarization, dielectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric properties are highly sensitive to external mechanical loads. External compressive stress increases the phase transition temperature and the out-of-plane polarization and decreases the out-of-plane dielectric constant below T c, pyroelectric coefficient, and piezoelectric coefficient (absolute value) and vice versa. Compared with pervoskite-type ferroelectrics, the calculated results are opposite due to the different intrinsic parameters between pervoskite and polymer ferroelectrics, especially, electrostrictive constants. The ability to tailor the properties in ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) thin films with the mechanical load can offer a tremendously promising future for applications in multifunctional devices, such as agile mechanical sensors and transducers. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

The activation energy against transformation is determined to be 2.7 eV according to Kissinger's formula. A good resistance ratio between the amorphous and the crystalline GeTe4 films is also demonstrated. These results reveal that GeTe4 can be a competitive candidate for phase change memory applications. In addition, the phase change in GeTe4 is accompanied by a transition in electric conduction behaviors, which is also discussed in the light of the Anderson transition. \u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics.",

The absorption of the 248 nm radiation by the GaN at the interface results in rapid thermal decomposition of interfacial layer, yielding metallic Ga and N2 gas.

X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence of GaN before and after lift-off process have been performed, which demonstrated that the separation and transfer process do not alter the structural quality of the GaN films.

The results showed that the effects of external stress on the value of polarization strain sensitivity and magnetoelectric (ME) polarization coefficient for PbTiO3 and P(VDF-TrFE) are opposite, in which the electrostrictive constants play a significant role. However, the external stress has similar influence on the value of ME voltage coefficient in the two heterostructures. The compressive stress increases their ME voltage coefficient, and a peak appears near the stress of 200MPa, in qualitative agreement with the experiment result. It is proposed that external stress might provide a new way to enhance or adjust magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic heterostructures. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Physics.",

The GaN and PZT films in the MFS structures have been characterized by various methods such as photoluminescence (PL), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The Electric properties of GaN MFS structure with different oxide thickness have been characterized by high-frequency C-V measurement. When the PZT films are as thick as 1 \u03bcm, the GaN active layers can approach inversion under the bias of 15V, which can not be observed in the traditional GaN MOS structures. When the PZT films are about 100 nm, the MFS structures can approach inversion just under 5V. All the marked improvements of C-V behaviors in GaN MFS structures are mainly attributed to the high dielectric constant and large polarization of the ferroelectric gate oxide.",

The effects of LN-doping on the structural and electrical properties of the BNST\u2013xLN system were systematically investigated. The results of Raman spectroscopy revealed that the substitution of LN softens the phonon vibrations in the BNST\u2013xLN system, in accordance with the remarkable reduction in the phase transition temperature (TF\u2212R), remnant polarization (Pr), negative strain (Sneg) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33). However, the degradation of the long-range ferroelectric orders was accompanied by a significant increase in the electric field\u2013induced strain response. At x\u2009=\u20090.04, a maximum unipolar strain of ~\u20090.36% with a corresponding normalized strain (Smax/Emax) of ~\u2009600\u00a0pm/V was obtained at room temperature, which should be mainly ascribed to the reversibly electric field-induced phase transition between the ergodic relaxor and ferroelectric phases due to their comparable free energies in the two-phase coexistence region. Moreover, it was also found that the BNST\u2013xLN system processes predominant electrostrictive behaviors with relatively high electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) and excellent temperature stability when the field-induced phase transition cannot be trigged by the applied electric field, as evidenced by a fact that the Q33 value of BNST\u20130.08LN ceramic keeps almost constant as high as ~\u20090.028\u00a0m4/C2 in the temperature range from room temperature to 120\u00a0\u00b0C.",

The absorption of the 248 nm radiation by the GaN at the interface results in rapid thermal decomposition of the interfacial layer, yielding metallic Ga and N2 gas. The substrate can be easily removed by heating above the Ga melting point of 29\u00b0C. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements of GaN before and after lift-off process have been performed, which demonstrated that the separation and transfer process do not alter the structural quality of the GaN films.

It is revealed that the melting and crystallization temperatures for both nanowires and nanotubes decrease as the diameter of the nanostructures is reduced. There exists a critical diameter for both nanowires and nanotubes, below which the crystallization could not take place. It determines the ultimate scaling limit of nanowires or nanostructures phase-change memory. The critical diameter for nanowires depends on the difference between the surface energy of solid and liquid phases, the bulk melting and crystallization temperatures, as well as the melting and crystallization entropy. The critical diameter of the nanotubes is larger than that of the nanowires. And it is also dependent on the ratio of outer diameter over inner diameter of the tubes. The lower ratio of outer diameter over inner diameter gives rise to the larger critical diameter of the nanotubes. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

It was characterized by x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The luminescence band centers around 285 nm and shows a large Stokes shift compared with the excitation spectrum, indicating a strong electron-phonon interaction in the photocatalyst BaZn1/3/Nb2/3O3. The electronic structure of BaZn1/3N-b2/3 O3 was calculated by using the pseudopotential method of the density function theory. It shows that the conduction band should be mainly composed of the Nb 4d states, and the valence band should be mainly composed of the O 2p state, The densities of the O 2p states and the Zn 4s states at the bottom of the conduction band are very low. The Zn 4s states show an expanded structure, which was proposed to be helpful for the migration of the photoexcited carriers, thus favoring the photocatalytic activity of BaZn1/3Nb2/3 O3. \u00a9 2007 Materials Research Society.",

In addition to the transmittance of above 86% for visible light, high resistance ratio, good data retention and initial forming-free resistance switching behaviour were obtained in the transparent memory. The results of high-resolution spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses combining with the temperature dependence of resistance suggest that metallic Eu filaments are formed in the low-resistance state. Mechanism analysis indicates that the coexistence of oxygen vacancies and metallic Eu in the Eu2O3 films plays an important role in the forming-free resistive switching performance. The switching mechanism was attributed to formation/oxidation of filamentary and oxygen ion migration. ? 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Theoretical results show the existence of an optimum waveguide design, which is insensitive to inhomogeneities in the waveguide thickness due to 'non-critical' phase-matching in some waveguide geometry. Using a coupled-mode theory, the overlap integral in second-harmonic generation in the film waveguide has been analysed. Some proposals are offered for increasing the overlap integral of the fundamental wave and the harmonic wave. Application of such a waveguide design can significantly ease the fabrication tolerance, leading to second-harmonic generation devices with long interaction lengths and practical conversion efficiencies.",

ZnO films were directly deposited on \u03b1-Al2O3 by pulsed laser deposition, and ZnAl2O4 layers were synthesized by annealing ZnO/\u03b1-Al2O3 wafers at 1100\u00b0C. GaN films were then grown on these combined substrates by light-radiation heating low-pressure MOCVD. X-ray diffraction pattern of ZnAl2O4/\u03b1-Al2O3 shows the peaks of ZnAl2O4 (111). When the annealing time during ZnAl2O4 formation increases from less than 30 min to 20 h, the morphology of ZnAl2O4 surface changes from uniform islands to bulgy-line structures, while the structure of corresponding GaN films deposited on these substrates changes from c-axis single crystal to polycrystalline. The results indicate that islands on thin ZnAl2O4 layer can promote nucleation at the initial stage of GaN growth, so as to increase the quality of GaN film.",

It is revealed that there is a critical thickness below which the crystallization cannot occur. The critical thickness is determined by the energy difference \u0394\u03b3 between the crystalline GST/substrate interface energy and the amorphous GST/substrate interface energy, the melting enthalpy, and the mole volume. The calculated result is in good agreement with the experiments. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature is also affected by interface energy difference \u0394\u03b3. Larger \u0394\u03b3 gives rise to a higher crystallization temperature, and vice versa. This impact becomes stronger as the film thickness is decreased. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

Satisfactory electrolytic resistive switching phenomena were observed in the memory cells composed of amorphous or crystalline AGT films sandwiched between Ag and Pt electrodes. The measured high and low resistance values of amorphous/crystalline cells are distinguishable and in different order of magnitudes. The electrically driven amorphous/crystalline phase change was also demonstrated in the cells sandwiched between two Pt electrodes. It is proposed that by controlling and using the electrolytic resistive switching in amorphous/crystalline cells and the electrically driven amorphous/crystalline phase change of these cells, a new type of four-state memory might be created. \u00a9 2010 The Electrochemical Society.",

        "abstract": "A metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor (MFS) structure has been developed by depositing SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) films directly on n-type (100) Si by pulsed laser deposition. In the MFS structure, evidence for ferroelectric border traps in the SBT film has been obtained by high-frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement. When the ramp rate of voltage is higher than 200 mV/s, typical ferroelectric C-V hysteresis loops with the counterclockwise direction are obtained in C-V plots. When the ramp rate is lower than 80 mV/s, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops are replaced by the trap-induced ones with the clockwise direction. This pronounced change results from the fact that more and more border traps in SBT can communicate with the underlying Si. The border-trap density at the ramp rate of 10 mV/s is as high as 1.8\u00d71012 cm-2. Moreover, the width of the hysteresis loops changes linearly with the logarithmic decrease in ramp rate, which is consistent with the ferroelectric border traps communicating with Si by tunneling or a thermally activated process. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

The GaN and PZT films in the MFS structures have been characterized by various methods such as photoluminescence (PL), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The Electric properties of GaN MFS structure with different oxide thickness have been characterized by high-frequency C-V measurement. When the PZT films are as thick as 1 \u03bcm, the GaN active layers can approach inversion under the bias of 15V, which can not be observed in the traditional GaN MOS structures. When the PZT films are about 100 nm, the MFS structures can approach inversion just under 5V. All the marked improvements of C-V behaviors in GaN MFS structures are mainly attributed to the high dielectric constant and large polarization of the ferroelectric gate oxide. \u00a9 2000 Materials Research Society.",

After annealing at high temperature, Zr 0.8Si0.2O2 films suffer a phase separation to precipitate tetragonal ZrO2 nanocrystals in ZrSiO4 amorphous matrix. Their crystal structure, microstructure, optical absorbance and photoluminescence have been systematically investigated. Tetragonal ZrO 2 nanocrystals show intense UV emission around 392 nm under photonic excitation with a wavelength of 250 nm.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show that as the reaction proceeds, ZnAl2O4 changes from the initial (111)-oriented single crystal to poly-crystal, and then to inadequate (111) orientation. Corresponding\n scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicate that the surface morphology of ZnAl2O4 transforms from uniform islands to stick structures, and then to bulgy-line structures. In addition, XRD spectra present\n that ZnAl2O4 prepared at low temperature is unstable at the environment of higher temperature. On the as-obtained ZnAl2O4/\u03b1-Al2O3 substrates, GaN films were grown without any nitride buffer using light-radiation heating low-pressure MOCVD (LRH-LP-MOCVD).\n XRD spectra indicate that GaN film on this kind of complex substrate changes fromc-axis single crystal to poly-crystal as ZnAl2O4 layer is thickened. For the single crystal GaN, its full width at half maximum (FWHM) of X-ray rocking curve is 0.4\u00b0. Results\n indicate that islands on thin ZnAl2O4 layer can promote nucleation at initial stage of GaN growth, which leads to the (0001)-oriented GaN film.",

They were characterized by x-ray diffraction and UV-visible reflectance spectroscopy. Both of the photocatalysts absorb UV and visible light photons obviously, which can be attributed to their special crystal and electronic structures. The valence band of Ba3 Ni Nb2 O9 was determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements of Ba3 Ni Nb2 O9 film as deposited by using a pulsed laser deposition technique suggested that the lower conduction band should be composed of the Ni eg states. The band structures were proposed through the theoretical calculation of the electronic structures by using density functional theory with the local spin-density approximation. The hybridized O 2p and Ni t2g states in the photocatalysts Ba3 Ni Nb2 O9 and Ba3 Ni Ta2 O94 act as the new valence band instead of the O 2p orbital, and the Ni eg states act as the lower conduction band in Ba3 Ni Nb2 O9 and Ba3 Ni Ta2 O9. \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society.",

The specific heat of the wurtzite GaN is calculated from the Raman-scattering data. The contributions of the acoustic modes and optical modes to the primary pyroelectric coefficient of GaN are calculated from 0 to 600 K. An explicit expression of the primary pyroelectric coefficient as a function of temperature is derived. It is found that the primary pyroelectric coefficient of GaN can be expressed as the sum of the Debye function and Einstein function. It is substantially different from that of conventional ferroelectrics-based pyroelectric devices which can be described only by the Einstein function. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.",

The microstructural, electrical and low-field magnetotransport properties of these films are evaluated as functions of the deposition temperature. The film crystallinity depends substantially on the deposition temperature. Significantly enhanced low-field magnetoresistance for the samples deposited from 570 \u00b0C to 600 \u00b0C, in which amorphous phase and polycrystalline phase coexist, is observed. The electrical and low-field magnetotransport properties of the thin films are explained by the two-channel model where insulating channels of variable-range-hopping conduction and metallic ones coexist.",

Screw <011] superdislocations turned to dissociate on {100} planes to form Kear-Wilsdorf locks. Faulted dipoles were found in specimens deformed below 6001 \ufffd\ufffdC, whereas no faulted dipole was found at 850\ufffd\ufffdC . In-situ heating observations on the faulted dipoles formed during deformation at room temperature indicated that the faulted dipole disappeared at about 600\ufffd\ufffdC. Based on these experimental results, the mechanism of brittle-to-ductile of TiAl alloy has been discussed.",

Film surface and structural properties were measured by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction. The optical properties, such as the wavelength dependence of the transmittance and the refractive index, were determined. A band gap of Eg=3.55eV was obtained experimentally. Optical properties were characterized by using a prism-coupling technique. We observed sharp and distinguishable transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) multimodes and measured the refractive indices of BTN thin films at 632.8nm. The ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices were calculated to be no=2.3528 and ne=2.3942. This means a birefringence of \u0394n=ne-no=0.0414 for BTN films.

        "abstract": "High quality BaTiO 3 optical-waveguide thin films on MgO(1 0 0) substrate were fabricated successfully by using pulsed laser deposition technique. The properties of the samples were characterized by using Rutherford backscattering (RBS), X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and prism coupling method. The RBS shows no obvious evidence for interdiffusion between the film and the substrate. The thickness of the film and the Ba/Ti ratio were calculated based on RBS to be 881 nm and 1.004, respectively. X-ray diffraction results show that the as-deposited BaTiO 3 film is basically oriented polycrystalline, and strong ( l 0 0) peaks were revealed. The root mean square (rms) roughness of the film was evaluated to be 0.796 nm, this is only 0.1% of the film thickness. The bright TE ( m =0,1,2,3) and TM ( m =0,1,2,3) modes in the BaTiO 3 film optical waveguide were observed. 1 Introduction Barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ) as one of the most important ferroelectric materials has been studied intensively. It possess a variety of useful properties that have potential to be exploited in thin film devices, such as non-volatile memory devices, electro-optic devices, thin-film capacitors, and pyroelectric detectors [1\u20133] . Therefore, a great deal of effort has been made to investigate the preparation and characterization of BaTiO 3 thin films in recent years. A variety of methods, such as sputtering [4,5] , metalorganic chemical vapor deposition [6,7] and pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) [8\u201310] , have been applied to prepare such films, and many high quality BaTiO 3 films have been deposited successfully by using these methods. But most of the works are concerned with the stoichiometry, crystalline and dielectrical properties of the films. Few studies have been reported on the optical-waveguide properties of BaTiO 3 films. To our knowledge, there are no reports on photographs of the excited optical-waveguide multimode for BaTiO 3 thin films. An optical-waveguide film device is one of the most important elements in integrated optics. Therefore, to fabricate high quality optical-waveguide films has both theoretical and practical significance. To fabricate an optical-waveguide structural film, the refractive index of the substrate must be lower than that of the film, and the lattice mismatch between the film and substrate is expected to be as small as possible. MgO is a very good substrate for BaTiO 3 optical waveguide. MgO possess a lower refractive index and a good optical transparency, its lattice constant is close to that of BaTiO 3 , so a BaTiO 3 /MgO structure is favorable in optical-waveguide applications. Among the methods, used to fabricate BaTiO 3 films, PLD is a very useful and flexible tool. In this paper, we have described the growth of high quality BaTiO 3 film by PLD process and reported it's optical-waveguide properties. 2 Experiment The deposition of the film was performed by using the KrF excimer pulsed irradiation of 248 nm in wavelength, 30 ns in pulse width, and 5 Hz in frequency. A detailed description of the apparatus used in this experiment was presented elsewhere [11] . A BaTiO 3 single crystal target was mounted on a metal disc with the angle of 45\u00b0 to the laser beam and the substrate surface, respectively. The polished MgO(1 0 0) substrate (5\u00d75\u00d71 mm 3 ), which had been preannealed in air at 800\u00b0 for 60 min, was placed directly on the metal pad, which can be heated by using a controlled electric stove. The MgO substrates were purchased from Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science. During deposition the target and the substrate (with the metal pad) rotated at a speed of 0.1 and 0.2 rad/s, respectively. The distance between the target and substrate was about 3.5 cm. The laser beam of 7\u00d720 mm 2 was focused on the rotating target in the depositing chamber by a quartz lens. An optimum 5 Pa oxygen pressure, with which the oxygen was leaked into the chamber as the reactive ambient, was determined. To reduce the surface roughness and enhance the crystallinity of the film, the substrate temperature and energy fluence of the excimer irradiation was optimized at 860 \u00b0C and 2.1 J/cm 2 , respectively. The depositing time of the sample was 80 min, and after deposition the sample was kept in the chamber at 750 \u00b0C and O 2 ambient for 60 min to avoid oxygen deficiencies, then the sample was cooled to room temperature in 30 min. The morphology and the crystallographic structure of the as-prepared film was identified by atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 diffraction (XRD) using CuK \u03b1 radiation, respectively. The thickness of the film and the interdiffusion between the film and the substrate were characterized by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) technique. The energy of incident He ions was 2.1 MeV and the backscattered He ions were registered by a surface barrier detector which was placed at 165\u00b0 with respect to the incident beam direction. A detailed description of the RBS technique used in this work can be found in Ref. [12] . The optical-waveguiding properties of the film were investigated by using the prism-coupler method with a laser beam of 633 nm wavelength. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the RBS spectrum from BaTiO 3 thin film on MgO substrate. The simulation of the RBS spectrum gives that the layer thickness of the as-deposited BaTiO 3 film is 881 nm and the ratio of Ba and Ti in the film is 1.004. This ratio is in good agreement with the target composition. To determine the oxygen concentration in the film by RBS is difficult, because the atomic mass of oxygen is lower than that of Ba and Ti. No evidence for interdiffusion between the film and the substrate was found. In addition to RBS, XRD measurement was performed to characterize the crystallinity of the film. A typical \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 diffraction pattern of the deposited BaTiO 3 film for CuK \u03b1 line is shown in Fig. 2 . As it is shown, strong ( l 0 0) peaks and one weak peak were revealed. The weak one was observed at 2 \u03b8 of 31.502\u00b0, which may be assigned to the diffraction from (1 0 1) surface. It was shown that the as-deposited BaTiO 3 film is basically highly oriented polycrystalline, in which microcrystals having different orientations are included. It should be mentioned that the ( l 0 0) and (0 0 l ) peaks of XRD for BaTiO 3 material are located close to each other. The d spacing for the peaks was used to distinguish the crystal orientation of the film. The d spacing for the peaks at 2 \u03b8 equal to 22.166\u00b0, 45.121\u00b0 and 70.272\u00b0 were calculated to be 0.4066, 0.2007 and 0.1338 nm which are closer to the (1 0 0), (2 0 0) and (3 0 0) spacing of bulk BaTiO 3 , respectively. The ( l 0 0) peaks are strong and sharp, this indicates that the film is highly oriented with a -axis perpendicular to the surface of the film. The smaller lattice mismatch between the c -axis of BaTiO 3 and the MgO substrate may be the reason for the a -axis orientation of the BaTiO 3 thin film. Some papers indicate that c -axis BaTiO 3 thin films [10,13] were obtained on (0 0 l ) MgO substrate by PLD, the reason for the difference is not clear. The morphology of the film surface is important for waveguide applications. A rough surface leads to scattering losses. To estimate the surface roughness, the as-deposited BaTiO 3 film was characterized by AFM. Fig. 3 shows an image of 1\u00d71 \u03bcm 2 area. The surface is quite flat and the maximum variation in height (peak to valley roughness) is about 5.5 nm. The rms roughness was evaluated to be 0.796 nm. This is only 0.1% of the deposited thickness. AFM measurements suggest that no significant contribution to waveguide loss is expected from the surface morphology. To characterize the optical-waveguide properties of the BaTiO 3 film, a prism coupler with a laser beam of 633 nm was used. The geometry of the prism coupler was described in detail in [14] . Fig. 4 shows the excited transverse electrical (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) multimodes of the film. The photographs are for the sample deposited at 860 \u00b0C substrate temperature, 5 Pa oxygen pressure and 80 min. The further analysis of the m -lines indicates that all the features of the lines are in good agreement with Tien's theoretical analysis and experiment conclusions [15] . The bright and sharp m -lines for TE and TM modes indicate that the optical waves have been well guided in the BaTiO 3 film, and this means that the as-deposited optical-waveguide film posses a high quality waveguide properties. Many samples of BaTiO 3 optical-waveguide film have been deposited at different conditions, such as different temperature and different oxygen pressure etc. The properties of these samples were also checked by using RBS, X-ray, AFM and prism coupling method etc. From all the measurement results, it could be found that the temperature of the substrate and the oxygen pressure were most important factors during the deposition of the film by PLD. They have important influence on the crystalline quality of the deposited films. The crystalline quality of the films has significant influence on the optical-waveguiding properties of the film. High quality and oriented crystalline waveguiding films will excite sharp and bright m lines by laser beam. 4 Summary The high quality BaTiO 3 optical-waveguide films were deposited on MgO substrate by pulsed laser deposition. The films have been checked by using RBS, XRD and AFM etc. It was found that the sample deposited at 860 \u00b0C substrate temperature and 5 Pa oxygen pressure was basically highly oriented polycrystalline film, and the surface of the film was quite flat. The sharp and bright m lines of the waveguide TE and TM modes for the film were excited by using a prism coupler, with which a laser beam of 633 nm was coupled into the film, and the favorable optical-waveguide properties have been demonstrated. It is found that the temperature of the substrate and the oxygen pressure have important influence on the crystalline quality of the deposited films. Therefore it was very important to optimize the deposition conditions in the deposition process for fabricating high quality optical-waveguide films.

        "abstract": "Nanocrystalline BaTiO3 (BT) particles were synthesized via hydrothermal method, and their microstructure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The results show that the BT nanoparticles remain a metastable cubic structure at room temperature, as revealed by XRD and SAED. Such an abnormal crystallographic phenomenon was caused by the lattice defects such as OH- defects and barium vacancies. The BT nanoparticles exhibit a spherical morphology with an average grain size of 70 nm, and narrow particle size distribution. HRTEM images of individual particles indicate that the BT nanoparticles have a good crystallinity and smooth surfaces. However, dark-field TEM images revealed high strains in BT nanoparticles, which were probably resulted from the surface defects. Anti-phase boundaries were also observed in some BT nanoparticles, which were formed by the intersection of two crystalline parts with a relative displacement from each other by frac(1, 2) d100 or frac(1, 2) d111, as revealed by HRTEM images. Some local dark TEM contrast observed, near the pure edge dislocations with Burgers vector value of d110, was due to the existence of local strains around the pure edge dislocations. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "The (Ba 1-xSr x)TiO 3 (BST) ferroelectric thin films exhibit outstanding dielectric properties, even at high frequencies (>1 GHz), and large, electric-field dielectric tunability. This feature makes them suitable for developing a new class of tunable microwave devices. The dielectric properties and dielectric tuning property of BST thin films are closely related to the film compositions, substrate types, and post-deposition process. The successful implementation of BST films as high-frequency dielectrics in electrically tunable microwave devices requires a detailed understanding of both their processing and material properties. This paper will review the recent progress of BST thin films as active dielectrics for tunable microwave devices. The technical aspects of BST thin films, such as processing methods, post-annealing process, film compositions, film stress, oxygen defects, and interfacial structures between film and substrate, are briefly reviewed and discussed with specific samples from the recent literature. The major issues requiring additional investigations to improve the dielectric properties of BST thin films for tunable microwave applications are also discussed.",

Structures of the films were analyzed by x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy. At an applied field of 275 kV/cm, the films showed good hysteresis loops with remnant polarization (Pr), saturated polarization (Ps) and coercive field (Ec) of 3.11 \u03bcC/cm2, 7.81 \u03bcC/cm2 and 68 kV/cm, respectively. At 120 kV/cm switching pulse field, fatigue tests were carried out systematically by varying the switching pulsewidth with a fixed duty cycle and with a fixed switching period, respectively. A gradual increase followed by an abrupt increase of the fatigue rate was observed with the increase of the switching pulsewidth. Field-induced defect diffusion was used to explain the results. \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Compositionally graded (Ba1-x Srx)TiO3 (BST) thin films (with 0.0 \u2264 \u00d7 \u2264 0.25) were grown by pulsed laser deposition on the (100)MgO single-crystal substrates covered with a conductive La0.5 Sr0.5 CoO3 (LSCO) layer as a bottom electrode. Their epitaxial growth, dielectric response, and microstructure were characterized. The epitaxial relationships between the BST, LSCO, and MgO can be determined as [001]BST//[001]LSCO//[001]MgO and (100)BST//(100)LSCO//(100)MgO, from the x-ray diffraction (rocking curve, \u03c6 scans) and electron-diffraction patterns. Dielectric data showed that the room temperature values of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the graded BST films were 630 and 0.017 at 100 kHz, respectively. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that both the BST films and the LSCO bottom electrode grow with a columnar structure, and they have flat interfaces and overall uniform thickness across the entire specimen. Cross-sectional high-resolution TEM images reveal that at the LSCO/MgO(100) interface, an interfacial reaction is not seen, whereas edge-type interfacial dislocations with their extra half-planes residing in the LSCO side are observed with an average interval of 2.20 nm, close to the theoretical value of 2.15 nm. At/near the LSCO/BST interface, the graded BST films grow perfectly and coherently on the LSCO lattice because they have the same type of crystal structure and almost same lattice constants, and no interfacial dislocations are observed. Planar TEM images show that the graded films exhibit granular and/or polyhedral morphologies with an average grain size of 50 nm, and the aligned rectangular-shaped voids were also observed. High-resolution TEM images show that the length sizes of voids vary from 8 to 15 nm, and with width of 5 to 10 nm along the <001> direction in the (100) plane. \u00a9 2008 Materials Research Society.",

The results showed that large Ba/Ti molar ratios in the precursors could lead to large particles with a cubic morphology. Smaller particles with a weaker agglomeration behavior were observed in the products synthesized via solvothermal process using ethylene glycol (EG) as reaction medium, in comparison to using either pure water or water-EG mixed solution as reactive medium. A terrace-ledge-kink surface structure and structural defects such as anti-phase boundaries (APBs) and edge dislocations with Burger's vector of 1/2d100 or 1/2d111 were observed at the edges of the nanoparticles. The {110} surfaces were found to be reconstructed and composed of the corners bound by the {100} mini-faces. APBs near the edges of BT nanoparticles were formed by the intersection of two crystalline parts with displacement deviation from each other by 1/2d110.",

Compared to the single layer organic device composed of CuCu-PcPt, the bilayer devices were observed to show distinct bistability with the resistance ratio of the off/on states up to 107 and low switch voltage (0.75-0.85 V). At least 105 switching cycles were achieved in the \"write-read-erase-read\" cycle voltage. The filament mechanism for the device is supported by the \"metallic\" behavior in their temperature dependence of the resistance in the on state.

The Curie temperature of PSZT films decreases with the increase of Sr contents and paraelectric PSZT films at room temperature are demonstrated as x approaches 0.4. The increase of Sr contents also leads to the simultaneous decrease of dielectric constant, tunability, and dielectric loss. The composition dependence of Curie temperature and tunability can be attributed to the shrinkage of crystal lattice due to a Sr addition. PSZT films with x=0.6 show the largest figure of merit of 24 with a moderate tunability of 48% and a dielectric loss of 0.02. This suggests that Sr-modified PZT is a potential candidate for voltage tunable applications. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics.",

The Ising spin moment and ferroelectric displacement and their susceptibilities as well, as a function of temperature for systems of different magnetoelectric couplings, are simulated and compared with the mean-field approach. The typical antiferromagnetic transition at N\u00e9el point and the ferroelectric transition at Curie point are observed at zero coupling. It is demonstrated that a weak ferromagnetic order can be activated by introducing the magnetoelectric coupling or applying external magnetic field, while the external electric field has little effect on the ferromagnetic ordering behavior. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

Amorphous LAO gate dielectric films were deposited on Si (0 0 1) substrates by low pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition using La(dpm)3 and Al(acac)3 sources. The effect of processing parameters such as deposition temperature and precursor vapor flux on growth, structure, morphology, and composition of LAO films has been investigated by various analytical methods deeply. The film growth mechanism on Si is reaction limiting instead of mass transport control. The reaction is thermally activated with activation energy of \u223c37 kJ/mol. In the initial growth stage, Al element is deficient due to higher nucleation barrier on Si. The LAO films show a smooth surface and good thermal stability and remain amorphous up to a high temperature of 850 \u00b0C. The electrical properties of amorphous LAO ultrathin films on Si have also been evaluated, indicating LAO is suitable for high k gate dielectric applications. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The nematic liquid crystal 4\ufffd\ufffd-n-pentyl-4-cyano-biphenyl (5CB) is used to display the orientation features of the above prepared films. Based on the experiments, a picture is presented about the formation of the polymer films. It is expected that the as-deposited highly oriented polymer films by laser ablation will find various applications in integrated optics and liquid crystal displays.",

Effect of excess Bi contents on the microstructure and electrical properties were investigated. A predominant layered perovskite structure could be formed when an excess Bi less than 30% was added. For films above 30% excess of Bi, secondary phases occurred. The remnant polarization and dielectric constant decreased with excess Bi content. This was attributed to a smaller grain size and the presence of secondary phases. The leakage current characteristics were also examined. Space charge limited mechanism was observed in SBT films. In summary, 10% excess Bi was found to be the optimum composition with respect to grain size, morphology, and electrical properties.",

The piezoelectric ZnO layers were completely (0001) textured and had the piezoelectric coefficient d33. The nonpiezoelectric (inactive) Al2O3 layers were amorphous and acted as good media for microwave and supersonic wave propagation. The periods were controlled by the deposition time in the range of 2.0 to 400 nm with the total period number of 4 to 30. In the multilayer films with ultrashort period of 2.1 nm, (0002) X-ray diffraction peak of ZnO layers was considerably broadened by the noncrystalline Al2O3 layers. In the multilayer films with short period of 6.4 nm, the diffraction peaks presented in small angle implies that the interfaces between layers were much flat and sharp. And in the multilayer films with long period, (0002) peak was very sharp, similar to the normal ZnO thin films. High frequency resonance was measured in the long-period multilayer films in the range of 1 - 20 GHz and higher frequency resonance is expected in the multilayer films with shorter period.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the interfacial characteristics of LaAlO 3 (LAO) and LaAlOxNy (LAON) films deposited directly on silicon substrates by the pulsed-laser deposition technique. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) pictures indicate that an interfacial reaction between LAO and Si often exists. The interfacial layer thickness of LAO films deposited in a nitrogen ambient atmosphere is smaller than that of LAO films deposited in an oxygen ambient atmosphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were used to study the composition of the interfacial layer. The shift of the La 3d photoelectron peak to a higher binding energy compared to LaAlO3, the shift of the Al 2p peak to a higher binding energy compared to LaAlO 3, the shift of the Si 2p peak to a lower binding energy compared to SiO2 and the intermediate location of the O 1s peak compared to LaAlO3 and SiO2 indicate the existence of a La-Al-Si-O bonding structure, which was also proved by the AES depth profile of LAO films. It can be concluded that the interfacial layer is not simply SiO2 but a compound of La-Al-Si-O.",

The role of electrically-derived redox of Ti in such memristive switching is shown. The structural and chemical evidence of the electrically-derived oxidation is presented by TEM and XPS experiment, respectively. Due to the redox of the top electrode Ti and the consequent drift of oxygen vacancies, the device shows two distinct resistance states under a sweeping voltage loading. ON state is controlled by tunneling process, while OFF state is controlled by Schottky emission conductive mechanism. The failure behaviors of such memristive junctions are also discussed. In the light of the redox principle, we demonstrate that the devices could be recovered by loading a long electrical reduction treatment. \u00a9 2011 Author(s).",

The comparison of their phases, electrical resistivity, and porosity revealed that the use of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 powders of <1 \u03bcm size and a rapid liquid-phase sintering process of 855 \u00b0C for 5 min at 100 \u00b0C/s is beneficial to synthesize poreless single-phase BiFeO3 samples with high electrical resistivity of \u223c5\u00d71012 \u03a9 cm. Deoxygenated BixFeyO1.5x+1.5y-\u03b4 (x\u2260y, \u03b4\u22650) impurities were identified and found to be the main cause of low electrical resistivity and high porosity in the multi-phase samples. Large saturation polarization of 16.6 \u03bcC/cm2 and low leakage current density of 30 mA/m2, both at a high electric field of 145 kV/cm, were measured in the optimized single-phase samples at room temperature besides a large piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 27 pC/N and an obvious canted antiferromagnetic behavior. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

With increasing number of the interfaces in the charge trapping layer, the memory window increases first and then decreases due to electrostatic repulsion between the trapped electrons.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a monolithic ceramic bar with a gradient of piezoelectric activity across its thickness is introduced, which is fabricated by interdiffusion between a high piezoelectric and dielectric compositions. The microstructures of the interdiffusion layer have great effects on the electric field-induced displacement characteristics and interfacial strength of the monomorph piezoelectric actuator. The compositional profiles, phase distributions, and short-range phenomena in the interdiffusion layer formed in the PZT/PNN (PbNi 1/3 Nb 2/3 O 3 : PNN) monomorph ceramic actuators with functional gradients are investigated by electron probe microbeam analyses (EPMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The results show that the thickness of the interdiffusion layer ( d ) can be ordered as d Ni 2+ > d Nb 5+ > d Ti 4+ > d Zr 4+ . An interface between the rhombohedral and pseudocubic phases is found to exist in the interdiffusion layer by TEM observations and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. The SAED studies also reveal the presence of the 1/2 [111] superlattice spots along the [111] direction of perovskite cubic unit cell, and the origin of the superlattice is discussed.",

The room-temperature structures and dielectric properties are studied by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and HP4294A impedance/phase analyzer. The temperature-dependent ferroelectric properties are systematically investigated by using a RT66A ferroelectric tester combined with a temperature-controllable vacuum chamber. For well-saturated hysteresis loops, with the temperature decrease from 295 to 97 K, the coercive field (Ec) and remanent polarization (Pr) increase and the saturated polarization (Ps) is almost temperature-independent. However, this is not the case for the unsaturated hysteresis loops. Temperature-dependent fatigue-resistance of the PLT25 films is also experimentally established: after 2.22 \u00d7 109 switching cycles, the nonvolatile polarization decreases 38% when measured at room-temperature and it decreases 15% at 97 K. The nature and population of point defects and their effects on the subtle variations of the Ec, Ps, Pr, and fatigue-resistance against temperature are discussed in detail. \u00a9 2004 Materials Research Society.",

Al(acac)3 was used as metalorganic precursor. Impacts of substrate temperature and post-annealing in O2 or N2 on equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), leakage current density (JA) and carbon residue of Al2O3 films have been studied. It is found that post-annealing is necessary for ultrathin Al2O3 films to obtain good electrical properties. The EOT shows slight deposition temperature dependence and the lowest EOT value with \u223c0.8 nm is obtained at 600 \u00b0C. Typical Al2O3 ultrathin films have larger frequency dependence and EOT of \u223c 1.2 nm with JA of 36 mA/cm2 at Vg = + 1 V. AES depth profiles demonstrate that post-annealing in an O2 atmosphere could effectively eliminate the carbon contamination of Al2O3 films. Meanwhile, further post-annealing in N2 could decrease the JA of Al2O3 films to 8 mA/cm2.",

        "abstract": "Domain boundary precipitation and domain growth in binary polycrystalline materials are studied by applying the Monte Carlo simulation in two-dimensional squared lattice. The simulation is carried out on a hybrid lattice of the kinetic spin-exchange Ising model coupled with the Q-state Potts model. First of all, the static properties of this coupled model are studied, predicting just a small shiftdown of the critical point with enhanced Potts interactions. Subsequently, the dynamic properties, such as morphology and coarsening kinetics of the second phase precipitates as well as kinetics and scaling of the domain growth, are investigated in detail. Pronounced second phase precipitation at domain boundaries is observed at a temperature range just below critical point Tc as long as the solutes prefer to segregate onto the boundaries. However, the boundary precipitation is significantly prohibited at either high or low temperatures (T\u226bTc or T\u226aTc). We demonstrate that the domain growth is slowed down due to the pinning effect of the precipitates at the boundaries, no matter what the boundary migration ability is. The kinetics of boundary precipitation and domain growth in various systems are simulated. Both the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner law for second phase coarsening and the linear law for the normal domain growth become broken due to the domain boundary precipitation. The scaling behavior of the domain growth is identified in present systems although a further confirmation may be required. \u00a91999 The American Physical Society.",

Structures and electrical characteristics of the polycrystalline films were studied as functions of Zr composition. Structures were investigated by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. It is revealed that the Zr substitution does not destroy the layered structures of BLT but the Zr substitution tolerance is limited. With increasing Zr composition, generally, the octahedra-related vibration modes show a significant low-frequency shift. Compared with the well-known BLT films, the BLTZ0.20 films have larger remnant polarization (Pr), smaller coercive field (Ec) and better fatigue resistance. However, further increasing Zr composition leads to weakened ferroelectricity of the BLTZx films with decreased Pr and reduced fatigue resistance. The effects of Zr substitution on structures and ferroelectric properties of BLT and the correlation between structures and properties are discussed in detail. \u00a9 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The \"waist\"-like magnetic hysteresis for both the bilayer and trilayer is explained in terms of the inter-layer exchange coupling model based on the large difference in coercivity between LSCO and LSMO layers. The shrink of hysteresis with temperature is attributed to the temperature dependence of the magnetic crystalline anisotropy and conduction band width W.

The SBT films deposited at 650\u00b0C exhibited a remnant polarization of 6.6 \u03bcC/cm 2 and a coercive field of 23 kV/cm at 5 V. Higher leakage current was observed in films deposited at 550\u00b0C. Crystallinity of the films was examined by X-ray diffraction patterns and no secondary phases were observed. Furthermore, XRD patterns also indicated a change in orientation from c- axis dominated to randomly polycrystalline, when the deposition temperature was changed from 550 to 650\u00b0C. Grains in SBT film show polyhedral morphologies based on planar TEM analysis. The microstructures of grain boundaries in SBT film with c -axis dominated orientation were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).

Because of carrier diffusion across the dynamic domain boundaries in the Nb-STO layer and spin disordering in the LBMO layer, the tunneling resistance through the junction is high at zero magnetic field. The spin disordering is suppressed upon applying a non-zero magnetic field, which results in the spin-polarized tunneling in this ferromagnetic/depletion layer/dynamic ferromagnetic sandwiched structure and thus the observed TMR effect. The dependence of the TMR effect on the domain size in the LBMO layer, the tunneling current and temperature as well is explained, qualitatively consistent with the experimental observation. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The 90\u00b0 domain walls are identified by the 90\u00b0 rotation relationship of the electron diffraction pattern about the [001] zone axis, and which exhibit irregular configurations. Antiphase boundaries (APBs) in SBT single crystals are also observed, which exhibit ribbon-like morphologies. Fourfold vertices formed by four APBs meeting together are observed as predominant singularities, and are explained by a four-state clock model, in which the four states are considered as the TaO6 octahedra tilting left, right, forward, or backward along the crystallographic directions. Some threefold vertices are also observed since both threefold and fourfold vertices are energetically allowed in the present model. \u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

Thin films of SBT and KSBT were fabricated on Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition for comparison study. No x-ray diffraction peaks of KTaO 3 could be detected in the XRD patterns of the KSBT films, indicating a single phase of KSBT was obtained. The measured remnant polarization ( 2 P r ) values of SBT and KSBT films were 3.6\u00a0\u03bcC/cm 2 and 15.6\u00a0\u03bcC/cm 2 , respectively. The possible microstructural background responsible for the 4-times improved polarization was discussed. Furthermore, excellent ferroelectric fatigue-free property, retention property, and dielectric property of the KSBT films were exhibited experimentally. These results indicate that other than conventional site engineering such as substitution, adjusting the octahedra number between neighboring (Bi 2 O 2 ) 2+ layers is an alternative way to improve polarization of SBT while keeping its fatigue-free characteristics.",

The oxygen deficiency results in a serious shift of the insulating-metal (IM) transition toward the low-temperature side and anomalous transport behaviour over the low-temperature range. The ac susceptibility measurement reveals that, upon cooling, the sample exhibits a ferromagnetic transition, a weak anomaly at the IM transition and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition which may mainly arise from the charge ordering. Partial melting of the AFM state under a low magnetic field of 750 Oe is observed at 4.2 K.",

The epitaxial nature of the films had been established by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Rutherford backscattering spectrum(RBS). After anneal at 800 \u00b0C in O 2 atmosphere, the thin films exhibit metallic and magnetic properties. Ferromagnetic resonant spectra reveal that there are nonuniform regions of distinct magnetization in-plane of the films, which are related to the random distribution of lanthanum in the film, as confirmed by the RBS spectrum. The magnetization measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer is different from that obtained from the ferromagnetic resonance spectrum.",

With limited Fe2+ ions and its twinborn oxygen vacancies, both samples show low dielectric losses of <0.026 at 100 Hz and high maximum ferroelectric polarizations of \u223c34 \u03bcC cm2. The ferroelectric coercive field of BNFO is reduced by \u223c40%, reaching a low value of 235 kVcm, compared to that of BFO due to the increased ratio of 180\u00b0 and curved ferroelectric domains to total ferroelectric domains and better nucleation of the ferroelectric domains at the BNFOPt interface. The Raman scattering spectra confirm that the ferroelectric polarizations of both samples originate in the stereochemical activity of the Bi lone electron pair. Weak ferromagnetism is observed in both samples as a result of the limited amount of Fe2+ ions and \u03b3- Fe2 O3 impurity. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics.",

The c-axis-oriented SBTi films were grown on SrRuO3 seeded Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates while polycrystalline SBTi films were grown on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates. The measurements of ferroelectricity revealed that the direction of spontaneous polarization was not along the c axis since the polarization of c-axis-oriented films was much less than that of randomly oriented films. There was no significant degradation of switchable charge at least up to 1011 cycles for the randomly oriented films, suggesting that, even with Ti which was widely accepted to contribute to the fatigue of Pb(Zr, Ti)O3, SBTi showed superior fatigue characteristics. The randomly oriented films also showed excellent retention characteristics after 105 s. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

The interfacial structure and composition distribution were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and Auger-electron spectroscopy (AES). HRTEM confirms that there exists an interfacial layer between LAO and Si in most samples. AES, SIMS, and XPS analyses indicate that the interfacial layer is compositionally graded La-Al silicate and the Al element is severely deficient close to the Si surface. Electrical properties of LAO films were evaluated. No evident difference in electrical properties between samples with and without native SiO2 layers was observed. The electrical properties are discussed in terms of LAO growth mechanisms, in relation to the interfacial structure. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2004.",

        "abstract": "By using sol-gel spin coating method nanostructured Pb(Zr0.53Ti0.47)O3(PZT) ferroelectric thin films were fabricated on the Si substrates coated by nanoporous alumina membranes with average pore sizes of 20-100 nm, in which metal (Au or Pt) nanowires were embedded as a part of the bottom electrode. The dielectric, ferroelectric properties and microstructure of the nanostructured PZT thin films were characterized. The dielectric measurements demonstrated that the dielectric constant of the PZT nanofilms with a thickness of 25 nm decreased quickly from 860 to 100 as increasing the frequency below 104 Hz, and then remained almost constant of 100 as further increasing the frequency up to 106 Hz. Such a fast decrease of the dielectric constant in the low frequency region was resulted from the dielectric relaxation of space charges accumulated at the interfaces between the nanofilm and the (bottom and top) metal electrodes. The dielectric loss peak observed near 4000 Hz was contributed from the resonant absorption effect of the space charges. The polarization-electric field hysteresis loops of the nanostructured PZT films with a thickness 100 nm showed that the remanent polarization of the PZT nanofilm was 50 \u03bcC/cm2 and coercive field of 500 kV/cm. Cross-sectional TEM images showed that the nanostructured PZT films contacted directly with the bottom electrode (metal nanowires), and the interface between them exhibited some degree of waviness. It was found that some Au nanowires became into branches at their ends after post-annealing the PZT nanofilms, whereas such a phenomenon was effectively prohibited by using Pt nanowires. A selection of proper post-annealing temperature was the critical processing parameter for fabricating nanostructured PZT ferroelectric thin films as making a trade-off between the ordered metal nanowires within the nanoporous alumina membranes and the crystallinity of ferroelectric nanofilms.",

Structure characterization of the as-grown SBTi thin films by \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 scan X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed that the films consisted of (001)- and (100)-oriented crystalline grains. Using Pt/SBTi/Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si configuration, ferroelectric properties of the films were well established with the hysteresis loop of a remnant polarization Pr and a coercive field Ec of 3.11 \u03bcC/cm 2 and 68 kV/cm, respectively. The films exhibited excellent fatigue-free characteristics up to 10 11 switching cycles, characteristic of SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 (SBT) and SrBi 2 Nb 2 O 9 (SBN), and excellent retention characteristics after 10 5 s. The results showed that the Ti containing bismuth-layered-ferroelectrics could also improve the fatigue of the ferroelectric random access memories (FRAMs), and provided an alternative to optimize their ferroelectric properties and processing compatibility.",

In the surface region, Ba 3d5/2, Ba 3d3/2 Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d3/2 comprise two chemical states: the perovskite phase and the non-perovskite phase, whereas only a non-perovskite phase exists in the interface region.

The first three types can transform to the last one, once electroforming introduces enough charged defects to films and the resistance monotonically increases to a certain value. Unipolar resistive switch is due to conductive filamentary type and can be treated as an especial electroforming process.

A structural transition from rhombohedral to pseudo-cubic structures appeared around x = 0.33, and the formation of impurity phase of Bi 2Fe 4O 9 was effectively depressed by doping BaTiO 3. Dielectric constants of xBaTiO 3-(1 - x)BiFeO 3 solid solutions decreased with increasing the frequency, and the degree of decrease was related to the doping content of BaTiO 3. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the ferroelectric domain configurations in the multiferroic BiFeO 3-BaTiO 3 solid solutions with rhombohedral symmetry, exhibited a wavy character whereas a predominant intricate domain structure with fluctuating mottled contrast was observed in the multiferroic BiFeO 3-BaTiO 3 solid solution with pseudo-cubic phase structure. The presence of 1/2{1 1 1} superlattice spots in the selected area electron diffraction patterns taken from the multiferroic BiFeO 3-BaTiO 3 solid solutions with rhombohedral symmetry indicated that the ordered regions have a doubled perovskite unit cell. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.",

        "abstract": "Single-phase and lead-free Bi0.85La0.15FeO 3 multiferroic ceramics were prepared by a rapid liquid sintering method to study their crystal structure and multiferroic behaviors. Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data showed a pseudo-cubic structure plus a small triclinic distortion. The absence of Fe2+ ions suggested few oxygen vacancies. Large polarizations of 20.3 \u03bcC/cm2 together with a piezoelectric d33coefficient of \u223c27.7 pC/N were achieved. This ferroelectricity originates from the stereochemical activity of the A-site Bi3+ lone electron pair. The remnant magnetizations of 0.0744-0.227 emu/g of Bi0.85La0.15-FeO3 permitted by the canting angle of canted antiferromagnetic order was released as a result of the collapse of the space-modulated spin structure of BiFeO3. The observed dielectric anomalies proved the magnetoelectric couplings between ferroelectric order and canted antiferromagnetic order. \u00a9 2006 The American Ceramic Society.",

LAO films as a buffer layer show an amorphous structure, a relatively high dielectric constant and good electrical properties. Pt/BLT/LAO/n-Si annealed at 650\u00b0C exhibit better hysteretic capacitance-voltage characteristics, with a memory window of 1.3 V and extremely low leakage current density. Furthermore, the memory window does not alter with the sweeping rates of the bias voltage. This implies that the Si surface potential has been controlled by the poling charges of BLT. The introduction of a LAO buffer layer prevents the interfacial diffusion between the BLT and Si substrate effectively. Therefore, BLT/LAO/Si is an attractive candidate for ferroelectric field effect transistor applications.",

Metal Pt nanowires were embedded in NAMs as a part of the bottom electrode. The dielectric and ferroelectric properties, and microstructure of the nanostructured BaTiO3 films were characterized. The results show that the dielectric constant of the BaTiO3 nanofilms is decreased slowly from 196 to 190 as the increase of measured frequency from 103 Hz to 106 Hz, and their dielectric loss is increased slowly from 0.005 to 0.007 in the low frequency range from 103 Hz to 105 Hz, whereas quickly increased up to 0.013 at high frequencies over 105 Hz. The remanent polarization and the coercive field of the BaTiO3 nanofilms are 5 \u03bcC/cm2 and 680 kV/cm, respectively. Cross-sectional (scanning) transmission electron microscope (TEM) images demonstrate that the BaTiO3 nanofilms contact directly with the Pt nanowires, and the interface between them has some degree of waviness. Suitable post-annealing temperature is the critical processing parameter of fabricating nanostructured ferroelectric films as considering a trade-off between the ordered degree of metal nanowires within NAMs and the crystallinity of ferroelectric nanofilms.",

The results show that PFN is in rhombohedron structure from 80 K to its ferroelectric phase transformation temperature at 383 K. Over antiferromagnetic phase transition temperature, the diagonal of PFN crystal cell gradually gets short, and below Neel critical point the structure of PFN crystal no change. The peaks of Raman spectra no change at temperature of 80-200 K, indicating that there is no change in structure within this temperature range. The experimental results are useful for the further investigation on the mechanism of ferroelectromagnets.",

        "abstract": "We have heteroepitaxially deposited compositionally graded (Ba 1-xSr x)TiO 3 (BST) thin films with increasing x from 0.0 to 0.25 on (100)-oriented MgO substrates using pulsed-laser deposition. The compositional gradients along the depth in the graded films were characterized by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. By using surface interdigital electrodes, the planar dielectric response of epitaxial graded BST films was measured as a function of frequency, temperature, and dc applied voltage. At room temperature, the dielectric constant of the graded BST film was about 450 with a dielectric loss, tan\u03b4 of 0.007 at 100 kHz. Measurements varying the dc bias voltage showed hysteresis of the dielectric response and a tunability of 25% at an applied electric field of 80 kV/cm. The graded BST films undergo a diffuse phase transition with a broad and flat profile of the capacitance versus temperature. Such behavior of the dielectric response in graded BST films is attributed to the presence of the compositional and/or residual strain gradients in the epitaxial graded films. With such a graded structure, it is possible to a build a dielectric thin-film capacitor with a low-temperature dependence of the capacitor over a broad temperature regime. \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics.",

Structures of the films were systematically characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), including \u03b8-2\u03b8-scans, rocking curve scans and \u03c6-scans, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The epitaxial orientation relation of the SBTi films on STO is established by selected-area electron diffraction and XRD \u03c6-scans to be (001)SBTi \u2225 (001)STO, [11\u03040]SBTi \u2225 [010]STO. Cross-sectional high-resolution TEM studies on the epitaxial SBTi film revealed that SBTi is a single-phase material. A special kind of irrational atomic shift along the [001] direction was observed and is discussed in detail. By using an evanescent microwave probe (EMP), the room-temperature dielectric constant of the epitaxial SBTi film was measured to be 211 \u00b1 20. Excellent electrical properties of the polycrystalline SBTi films with Pt bottom and top electrodes were exhibited: the Pr and Ec values were 4.1 \u03bcC cm-2 and 75 kV cm-1 respectively, the nonvolatile polarizations decreased by less than 5% after 2.22 \u00d7 109 switching cycles and the dielectric constant and loss tangent were 363 and 0.04 at 100 kHz.",

Structures and properties of the films were studied as functions of Zr composition. Structure characterization was conducted by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The Zr substitution does not change the layered structures of the BTZx. However, with increasing x from 0.2 to 1.5, the vibration modes of the TiO6 octahedra weaken greatly, which is responsible for the corresponding weakening ferroelectricity the remnant polarizations are 14.8, 11.2, 2.4, and 1.4 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively. Additionally, the Zr substitution cannot improve the fatigue-resistance of BTZx significantly. After 7.22\u00d7109 switching cycles, the nonvolatile polarization decreases by 30.3 and 64.9% of the initial values for x=0.2, and 0.5, respectively. The dielectric properties of these films are also investigated briefly. The relationship between the structures and properties is established experimentally. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Silver nanoparticles capped with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were self-assembled onto a two-dimensional DNA network template by electrostatic interaction and formed nanoporous silver films, which can be used as active surface-enhanced raman scattering (SERS) substrates. Two probe molecules, Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP), were studied on these substrates with very low concentrations, and great enhancement factors for R6G (0.21 x 10(10)-4.09 x 10(11)) and 4-ATP (approximately 1.70 x 10(5)) were observed. It was found that the enhancement ability was affected by the DNA concentration and the electrostatic absorption time of the CTAB-stabilized silver nanoparticles on the DNA strands. These SERS substrates formed by the self-assembly of silver nanoparticles on DNA network also show good stability and reproducibility in our experiments.",

        "abstract": "SrBi2Ta2O9, (SBT) films were prepared on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si and P-Si(100) substrates by metal-organic decomposition. Electric field was in-situ applied on the films during crystallization. It was found that magnitude and direction of the field and the substrate had great effect on structure, morphology and ferroelectric properties of the SBT films. Positive field (assuming the substrates is electrical grounded) enhanced C-axis orientation of the films deposition on Pt/TiO 2/SiO2/Si substrates, while negative field had little effect on it. Meanwhile electric field had no effect on that of the films deposited on Si substrates. The films deposited on Pt/TiO2/SiO 2/Si substrates under 90 V and 120 V applied voltage had good fatigue and retention properties. We think that amount and kind of induced charge in the interface between the film and substrate are main causes of the structure change. \u00a9 2002 Taylor & Francis.",

TEM images showed that BT nanoparticles synthesized at high Ba/Ti molar ratios in the precursors had large particle sizes and cubic morphology. Small faceted-particles were observed in the BT powders synthesized by using ethylene glycol (EG) as solvent, in comparison to reactive medium of pure water or water-EG mixed solution. X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction revealed that the as-produced BT nanoparticles exhibited a room temperature-stabilized cubic structure, whereas Raman spectra indicated a tetragonal phase BT existing in the produced nanoparticles, which is not the dominant phase due to the weak characteristic peak of tetragonal structure at 305 cm -1. HRTEM images demonstrated that the BT nanoparticles with either cubic or rectangular shapes, were bounded by their {100} facets, and a terrace-ledge-kink surface structure was frequently observed at the edges of rough nanoparticles. Surface steps lying on the {100} planes were clearly observed. However, in the spherical nanoparticles, their surface edges were very smooth, and no surface steps were observed.

        "abstract": "Thin films of Bi 3.25 La 0.75 Ti 3 O 12 (BLT) were fabricated by pulsed-laser deposition. The ferroelectric fatigue and Raman measurements were carried out on the as-prepared, postannealed in air and postannealed in oxygen BLT films (BLT-1, BLT-2 and BLT-3, respectively). It was revealed that the BLT-2 films have the weakest fatigue-resistance and highest frequency shifted Raman vibration modes, indicating the highest oxygen vacancy concentration in the BLT-2 films. Based on the BLT-2 films, the temperature-dependent effect of oxygen vacancy on polarization switching is investigated. Generally, the coercive field ( E c ) increases while the switched polarization ( P s ) decreases monotonically with decreasing temperature. However, the remnant polarization ( P r ) increases when the temperature decreases from 300 to 167 K, then decreases with further decreasing temperature. The results can be well explained using a model based on the temperature-dependent depth and shape of the domain wall-defect interaction potential well.",

All the films as deposited at a substrate temperature of 600\u00b0C and in 20 Pa nitrogen ambient have amorphous structures. Their crystallization temperatures are not less than 845\u00b0C. For ease of comparison, all the films are deposited under the same deposition conditions and all the films deposited on hydrogen terminated silicon (100) substrates have the same physical thickness of 9 nm. The dielectric constant of the materials as well as the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) and the leakage current density of the Pt/LAON/Si structures as functions of nitrogen concentration of the films were studied systematically and determined. It is found that with a dielectric constant of 33, an EOT of 2 nm and a leakage current density of 11.5 mA cm-2 at 1 V, the LAON films with y = 0.4 exhibited optimal properties for high-k gate dielectric applications.

        "abstract": "SrBi2Ta2O9(SBT)/LaNiO3 (LNO)/Si and SBT/Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si multilayers were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition. With Pt top electrodes, the measured remanent polarization (2Pr) of Pt/SBT/LNO/Si and Pt/SBT/Pt/TiO2/ SiO2/Si capacitors was 6.5 \u03bcC/cm2 and 5.2 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively. Using LNO as both bottom electrodes and buffer layers, enhanced non-c-axis crystalline SBT films were induced, which resulted in a 2Pr greater than that of the Pt/SBT/Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si capacitor. The hysteresis loop of the Pt/SBT/LNO/Si capacitor showed a great external-field-dependent horizontal shift. Using an electron-injection model, this dependence was addressed. The fatigue-free property of the Pt/SBT/LNO/Si capacitor was experimentally established, in that the non-volatile polarization decreased by less than 5% of the initial value after 1.44 \u00d7 109 switching cycles.",

It is revealed that the films with odd m have a ferroelectric hysteresis loops whereas those with even m have collinear polarization-electric field curves.

        "abstract": "The formation and diffusion of vacancies are studied in LaAlO 3/SrTiO 3 heterostructures. Oxygen vacancies (V OS) appear easily in the SrTiO 3 substrate during LaAlO 3 film growth at 700\u00b0C and 10 4Pa oxygen pressure rather than at 10 3-10 1Pa, thus the latter two-dimensional electron gas should come from the polarity discontinuity at the (LaO) +/(TiO 2) 0 interface. For SrTiO 3\u03b4/LaAlO 3/SrTiO 3, high-density V OS of the SrTiO 3\u03b4 film can pass through the LaAlO 3 film and then diffuse to 1.7m depth in the SrTiO 3 substrate, suggesting that LaAlO 3 has V OS at its middle-deep energy levels within the band gap. Moreover, high-density V OS may combine with a strontium/titanium vacancy (V Sr/Ti) to form V Sr/Ti-O complexes in the SrTiO 3 substrate at 700\u00b0C. \u00a9 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Their structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties were investigated. The single-crystalline nature of the as-synthesized nanocrystals was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, selected area electron diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations show that Fe element exists as the Fe3+ valence state, as well as Bi element as Bi3+ in the as-prepared bismuth ferritic nanocrystals. The visible-light photocatalytic activities evaluated by the degradation of rhodamine B in aqueous solution show that the sillenite-type bismuth ferritic nanocrystals exhibit higher photocatalytic ability than the perovskite-type ones, which can be ascribed to their small mean particle size and the unique hexagonal-shape morphology, and also the structural characteristics of sillenite-type compound. The present results demonstrate that the hexagonal-shaped sillenite-type bismuth ferritic nanocrystals can be used as novel visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for degradation of organic compounds. \u00a9 2011 The American Ceramic Society.",

Effect of Sr deficiency compositions on the structural and electrical properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analyses, electronic probe microanalyses (EPMA), atomic force microscope (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrical measurements. The XRD results indicate the films with Sr deficiency content at 40% and below have layered perovskite structure with the distorted lattice. For films with 60% deficient Sr, the layered structure cannot be formed. SEM and AFM micrograph shows the surface morphology is very sensitive to the Sr deficiency. With increasing the Sr deficiency to 40% and above, the films exhibit the extremely inhomogeneity and poor crystallinity. The remnant polarization (Pr) gradually reduces with Sr deficiency. This is attributed to the distorted layered structure and the formation of amorphous phase. In summary, SrBi2.2Ta2O9 is found to be the optimum composition with respect to grain size, morphology, and electrical properties.",

        "abstract": "Compositionally-graded (Ba1-xSrx)TiO3 thin films (x varying from 0 to 0.25) were epitaxially grown by pulsed-laser deposition on (1 0 0)MgO single-crystal substrates with a conductive La 0.5Sr0.5CoO3 layer as bottom electrode. The crystallinity and epitaxial growth behavior of the graded BST films were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the graded films are (1 0 0)-oriented with an orientation relationship of (1 0 0)[0 1 0]BST//(1 0 0)[0 1 0]MgO. Cross-sectional TEM images show that graded BST films grow with a columnar structure and a surface roughness of 10 nm. From planar TEM images granular and/or polyhedral shaped grains are observed with an average grain size of 65 nm. At room temperature, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss at 10 kHz for the graded film were 953 and 0.0103, respectively. A broad and flat profile of the dielectric constant versus temperature was demonstrated in the graded film. This was attributed to the presence of the compositional and/or residual strain gradients in the epitaxial compositionally-graded films. With such a graded structure, it is possible to build dielectric thin film capacitors with almost negligible temperature dependence of the capacitance, thereby operating without the need for controlling the environmental temperatures. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "Interfacial structures of the Pt/SBT/Pt capacitors prepared by metallo-organic decomposition were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) as a function of the postannealed time at 750\u00b0C to investigate the interfacial evolution developed in the Pt/SBT/Pt capacitors. The results show that after postannealing at 750\u00b0C for a short time (e.g., 300 s), a thin amorphous layer was observed at the interfaces of the SBT/Pt-bottom and the SBT/Pt-top electrodes in the Pt/SBT/Pt capacitors, whereas after postannealing for a moderate time (e.g., 20 min), the interfaces of the SBT/Pt-bottom and the SBT/Pt-top electrodes became quite smooth and uniform, and almost free of the interfacial phase. However, after postannealing for a longer time (e.g., 60 min), an interfacial phase consisting of oval-shaped nanocrystallites was developed at both the SBT/Pt-bottom and the SBT/Pt-top electrode interfaces, which resulted in weakly bonded interfaces between the SBT films and Pt electrodes. This is the reason why a Pt electrode peeling phenomenon (similar to that reported in the Pt/SBT/Pt/capacitors annealed in the forming gas atmosphere) is frequently observed in the Pt/SBT/Pt capacitors postannealed for 60 min during the fabrication of cross-sectional TEM samples. Based on two-dimensional lattice fringes of the HRTEM images from the small nanocrystallites and the corresponding fast Fourier transform patterns, the oval-shaped nanocrystallites precipitated at both the SBT/Pt-bottom and the SBT/Pt-top electrode interfaces were determined to be a PtBi2 phase with a cubic structure. The formation of the Pt-Bi-based interfaces in the Pt/SBT/Pt capacitors is due to the reaction of bismuth (out-diffused from the SBT films) with Pt electrodes during the postannealing process. The elliptical morphology of the interfacial PtBi2 phase can be ascribed to its different growth rates in the parallel and vertical directions of the interface, and also the limited space for grain growth perpendicular to the interface. \u00a9 2008 The American Ceramic Society.",

Structures and properties of the films were studied as functions of Zr composition. Structure characterization was conducted by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The Zr substitution does not change the layered structures of the BTZ x . However, with increasing x from 0.2 to 1.5, the vibration modes of the TiO 6 octahedra weaken greatly, which is responsible for the corresponding weakening ferroelectricity the remnant polarizations are 14.8, 11.2, 2.4, and 1.4 \u03bcC/cm 2 , respectively. Additionally, the Zr substitution cannot improve the fatigue-resistance of BTZ x significantly. After 7.22\u00d710 9 switching cycles, the nonvolatile polarization decreases by 30.3 and 64.9% of the initial values for x =0.2, and 0.5, respectively. The dielectric properties of these films are also investigated briefly. The relationship between the structures and properties is established experimentally.",

X-ray analysis showed that the as-deposited films are amorphous and the films remain amorphous after a postannealing at 750\u00b0C for 30 min. The dielectric constant of the BNT films has been determined to be about 80 with a low loss tan \u03b4 of about 0.006 at 1 MHz. The capacitance-voltage (C-V), capacitance-frequency, and capacitance-temperature characteristics of a BNT capacitor with Pt top electrode were measured. A low leakage-current density of 4 \u00d7 10-6 A/cm2 at 6 V was measured, and a preliminary discussion of the leakage-current mechanism is also given. It is proposed that amorphous BNT-0.25 thin films will be a potential dielectric material for microwave applications.",

SBT film capacitors were postannealed in Ar (N2) at 350-750 \u00b0C and then reannealed in O2 at 750 \u00b0C. Effects of annealing atmosphere on the structure, morphology, and ferroelectric properties have been investigated systematically. The composition analyses indicate Ar- or N2-annealing at 750 \u00b0C leads to Bi evaporation and oxygen loss. Above 550 \u00b0C 100% Ar or N2 postannealing, the remnant polarization decreases and the coercive field increases significantly. The subsequent O2 recovery can hardly rejuvenate the electrical properties. The result is different from that with the effective O2 recovery in forming gas processing (annealing in an atmosphere containing 5% hydrogen). The possible origin and mechanism is discussed and proposed.",

The XPS peak corresponding to lattice oxygen ions showed obvious asymmetry, which indicated the different binding energy of Ti-O and Pb/Zr-O bonds. The PZT films showed a square hysteresis loop with remnant polarization (Pr) and saturated polarization (Ps) of 13.8 \u03bcC/cm2 and 31.5 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively.

The crystallinity of the as-grown films was analysed by XRD, which indicated that LN and LT were highly c-oriented while the SiO2 buffer was amorphous. The surface of the as-grown films was mirror-like, dense and crack-free; no large droplets were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The thicknesses of the LN, LT and SiO2 films were about 960, 360 and 1800 nm, respectively. The interface between the LN and LT films was sharp.

The films were obtained by spin-on pyrolysis of the precursor solutions on various substrates and then annealed at 550-850\u00b0C in dry oxygen, wet oxygen, or Ar. Effects of precursor solution concentration, anneal temperature, anneal atmosphere, substrate and Ar ion sputtering on the microstructure, morphology and electrical properties were investigated by means of x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrical measurements. The results indicated the grain size, and the remnant polarization (Pr) increased with increasing the anneal temperature up to 800\u00b0C and the significant hysteresis loop could be obtained only after anneal above 700\u00b0C. At 850\u00b0C, the pyrochlore phase and other secondary phases were observed along with the SBT phase, leading to the decreasing Pr and dielectric constant. In addition, the development of crystalline phase and electrical properties were affected by anneal atmosphere. When annealed in Ar at 750\u00b0C, the layered SBT structure was destroyed with evident Bi loss. As though the original structure could be restored basically by subsequent adequate O2 anneal, the electrical properties were deteriorated seriously due to the shorted capacitor. Wet oxygen anneal evidently deformed the morphology and the hysteresis loop. This was attributed to the effect of possible produced slight H2 due to the reaction between H2O and residual carbonaceous in films under Pt catalyst. Substrates also played an important role on film crystallinity. The films deposited on Si, SrTiO3, and crystal quartz at 750\u00b0C had a layered perovskite polycrystalline structure while the films on fused quartz exhibited poor crystalline nature even after 800\u00b0C anneal and films on NaCl showed (200)-predominant orientation of SBT phase with some pyrochlore. In addition, Ar ion sputtering might lead to the severe Bi and oxygen deficiency in the surface of the sputtered film. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

The formation kinetics of such monolayers was studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM) technique. A series of TMAFM images of DNA films obtained at various developing times show that before the sample was immersed into water for developing the DNA chains always seriously aggregated by contacting, crossing, or overlapping and formed large-scale networks on the mica surface. During developing, the fibers of DNA networks gradually dispersed into many smaller fibers up to single DNA chains. At the same time, the fibers or DNA chains also experienced rearrangement to decrease electrostatic repulsion and interfacial Gibbs free energy. Finally, a flat-lying, densely packed DNA monolayer was formed. A formation mechanism of the DNA monolayers was proposed that consists of aggregation, dispersion, and rearrangement. The effects of both DNA and Mg2+ concentration in the formation solution on DNA monolayer formation were also investigated in detail.",

        "title": "Time effect on the ferroelectric properties of SrBi2Ta2O9 thin films in forming gas processing",
        "abstract": "The systematic measurements of hysteresis loops of SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 (SBT) thin films (440 nm) were carried out after they were isothermally processed in forming gas (FG) for different periods of time. It was found that the remnant polarization of SBT thin films dropped about 50% when they were annealed in forming gas at 400 \u00b0C for only 1 min. At the same time, the coercive voltage dropped about 20%. Then during anneal time, from 1 to 6.5 min, the remnant polarization and coercive voltage did not have obvious change. When the anneal time was up to 7.5 min, the normal hysteresis loops could not be obtained. The possible physical mechanism was discussed in this paper to give an explanation of this time effect on the degradation of ferroelectric properties of SBT thin films during forming gas processing. Time effect SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 thin film Forming gas anneal 1 Introduction SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 (SBT) with layered perovskite structure is one of the leading candidate materials for integrated ferroelectric thin film applications, especially for nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) applications, because it exhibits negligible fatigue, has lower leakage current and can be prepared in very thin films without loss of bulk characteristics [1] . Recently, however, serious challenges in integrating the oxide ferroelectric capacitors into a standard LSI device fabrication process have emerged. One of them is that the SBT ferroelectric thin film capacitors can be damaged after the \u201cforming gas (FG) annealing step\u201d, which is usually processed at 400\u2013500 \u00b0C in an H 2 -containing reducing atmosphere [2\u20138] . However, the degraded ferroelectric properties can be almost completely recovered by subsequent annealing in oxygen [2,4,6] . The mechanisms of this hydrogen induced degradation in SBT thin films have been studied by using compositional analysis, solid-state chemistry methods [4,6,8] . But the detailed mechanisms of the degradation and the recovery have not been clarified because of the complication of SBT material itself. In this paper, the hysteresis loops of SBT thin films were systematically measured after they were isothermally annealed in forming gas for different periods of time. The time effect on the degradation of ferroelectric property of SBT thin films was found. This phenomenon has the advantage to help us understand the mechanism of the degradation in SBT thin films during forming gas annealing deeply. 2 Experimental details The MOD precursor solution used in this work was carboxylate solution diluted with organic solvent. The SBT solution was spin-coated on Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si substrates and then baked at 200\u2013400 \u00b0C on a hot plate. This process was repeated several times to obtain the desired film thickness. The typical thickness was 440 nm in this work. Final anneal was performed at 550\u2013800 \u00b0C in O 2 for 60\u2013120 min. Pt top electrodes with a diameter of 0.2 mm were magnetron sputtering deposited by using a stainless steel shadow mask. Post-annealing of top electrodes was performed at 750 \u00b0C in O 2 for 30 min [5,9] . In forming gas processing the SBT thin films, at first the SBT samples were placed in quartz tube and then the temperature was ramped up at a rate of 4.5 \u00b0C/min. During this period, nitrogen (purity of 99.999%) flowed through the tube. The temperature could be program controlled at 400 \u00b0C when it rose up to this required value. At this time, the forming gas (5% hydrogen+95% nitrogen) was introduced into the tube and SBT samples were annealed in this ambience for different periods of 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 min. After forming gas anneal, the temperature was ramped down to room temperature naturally in flowing nitrogen. 3 Experimental results and discussion The systematic measurements of hysteresis loops of these SBT thin films annealed in forming gas were carried out with two top electrodes set-up on RT6000HVS. Fig. 1 showed the polarization hysteresis loops of SBT thin films annealed in forming gas at 400 \u00b0C for different periods of time. The remnant polarization and coercive voltage versus annealing time in forming gas at 400 \u00b0C are plotted in Figs. 2 and 3 . In these results, it was found that the remnant polarization of SBT thin films dropped about 50% when these thin films were annealed in forming gas at 400 \u00b0C for only 1 min. At the same time, the coercive voltage dropped about 20%. Then, during annealing time from 1 to 6.5 min, the remnant polarization and coercive voltage did not have the obvious change. When the annealing time was up to 7.5 min, the normal hysteresis loop could not be obtained. Further measurement results showed that the leakage current of SBT thin films became larger when the forming gas annealing time was up to 7.5 min. When annealing time was up to 8.5 min, the SBT thin film was breakdown in hysteresis loop measurement. Here, we called 7.5 min was \u201ccritical time\u201d and 8.5 min \u201cbreakdown time\u201d. Our investigation also found that the critical time and the breakdown time were different for SBT thin films with different thickness. The resistivities of these SBT thin films were measured using RT6000HVS with two top electrodes set-up. The resistivity (log \u03c1 ) of SBT thin films versus annealing time in forming gas was plotted in Fig. 4 . This result showed that the resistivity changed abruptly when forming gas anneal time was 1, 7.5 (critical time) and 8.5 min (breakdown time). Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis was carried out on SBT thin films annealed in forming gas by using CAMECA IMS 6f magnetic sector SIMS. SIMS analyses results showed that the density of hydrogen was higher at the SBT surface and the interface between SBT and Pt bottom electrode. So, SBT was easily degraded at these areas. J. Im\u2019s work indicated that very thin nonferroelectric layer (\u223ca few nm) could cause the remnant polarization of ferroelectric thin films drop abruptly [8] . That is the reason why the remnant polarization of SBT dropped about 50% when these SBT thin films were annealed in forming gas for only 1 min. There were no obvious changes in the Raman spectra of SBT thin films before and after forming gas annealing ( Fig. 5 ). This result implied that 400 \u00b0C forming gas annealing could not destroy the SBT structure in SBT grains. So, the reductive role of hydrogen mainly occurred at the grain boundary when the forming gas anneal temperature was at 400 \u00b0C. The resistivity of these boundary areas became lower because of the reduction of hydrogen. As the annealing time increased, at last the SBT thin film was brokendown and the critical phenomenon appeared. 4 Summary The work of time effect on the ferroelectric properties of SBT thin films in forming gas processing indicated that there existed a critical time in the disappearance of hysteresis loop. When the forming gas anneal time was shorter than this time, the hysteresis loop of SBT had no further obvious change after the remnant polarization dropped about 50% when SBT thin film was annealed in forming gas for only 1 min. The reason of this critical phenomenon came from the fact that SBT thin films could be easily degraded at their surface and the interface between SBT and Pt bottom electrode during forming gas annealing. On the other hand, the reductive role of hydrogen mainly occurred at the SBT grain boundary, not in the SBT grains when the forming gas anneal temperature was at only 400 \u00b0C.

        "abstract": "The impact of postannealing in electric field on the structure, tunability, and dielectric behavior of rf magnetron sputtering derived (Ba,Sr)TiO 3 films has been studied. It has been demonstrated that postannealing in the proper electric field can increase the dielectric constant and the tunability remarkably and destroy the symmetry of capacitance-voltage characteristics of the films. The increased out-of-plane lattice constant and the appearance of the hysteresis loops in the electric-annealed films indicated the formation of small polar regions with tetragonal structure, which are responsible for the increased dielectric constant and tunability. It was proposed that the segregation of Ti3+ ions caused by electric annealing could induce the formation of BaTiO3-like regions, which are ferroelectric at room temperature. \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics.",

The films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which revealed that highly \ufffd\ufffd100\ufffd\ufffd textured PLT thin films with small surface roughness were achieved. The transmittance spectra of the films, measured using a double beam photo-electrometer, showed that the as grown films exhibited the average transmittance of 75% in the wavelength range of 400-2000 nm. The optical waveguiding properties were evaluated by the optical prism-film coupling method, which indicated that the m-lines of transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) multimodes were distinct.",

Anomalies in the dielectric constant as a function of temperature have been observed near its Neel temperature of ~ 143 K, which are indicative of the so-called magnetoelectric coupling between the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders in this compound. It is demonstrated that a weak magnetic transition appeared at the temperature a little below the Neel temperature, which confirms the earlier prediction from the Monte Carlo simulation in a qualitative sense. The magnetic hysteresis measurement proves that there does exists a weak magnetic order in PFN crystal below its Neel temperature.",

XRD and SEM results show that SBT powders still remain polycrystalline perovskite structure and amounts of Bi and \u03b4-Bi2O3 are reduced from SBT annealed in the forming gas at 400\u00b0C. Spherical and needle structures form on the surface of SBT thin films annealed in the forming gas at 500\u00b0C. Bi element in powders is more easily reduced at lower temperature compared with that of thin films and form needle structures on SBT surface. Bi deficiency derived from forming gas annealing causes serious ferroelectricity degradation on the SBT capacitors. Annealed in the forming gas ambient at 400\u00b0C for 5.5 min, the remnant polarization of SBT films drop about 43%. If annealing time is longer than 8.5 min, films are breakdown and ferroelectricity disappears totally. However, no obvious polarization fatigue with 10 electric field cycling could be observed.",

A highly (100) preferred orientation is developed, and enhanced tunability is obtained with the introduction of the bilayer structure. The orientation of the films and the interface between the two layers are both responsible for the improvement in the performance. It is also demonstrated that the in situ annealing before the deposition of the upper layer plays an important role in determining the tunable properties. A long post-annealing could destroy the bilayer structure, and hence degrade the enhanced dielectric characteristics and tuning properties of the films.",

Silver ions were first adsorbed onto the DNA network and then reduced in sodium borohydride solution. Silver nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanowires were formed by controlling the size of pores of the DNA network. The diameter of the silver nanoparticles and the aspect ratio of the silver nanorods and nanowires can be controlled by adjusting the DNA concentration and reduction time.",

The samples with 660 nm thickness were poled under dc voltage ranging from 1 to 8.25 V, and for different duration from 1 to 80 min. After poling, both the net-switched charge and switching time first jumped to higher values, then decreased with the elapse of time. The decreases were separated into two regimes, a fast and slow regime. The change of net-switched charge and switching time with poling voltage and poling time showed nonmonotonic behavior. These results were explained by the change of domain kinetics and the redistribution of charge carriers under both the applied and depolarization field. \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics.",

Using these carbon-free inorganic compounds as precursors, TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 films with good dielectric properties have been successfully deposited by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. Using these precursors, gate dielectric films can be directly deposited on Si substrates at lower temperatures without the introduction of oxidative gases such as O2, O3, and thus can effectively avoiding the formation of low dielectric constant interfacial layers. These results suggest that these anhydrous metal nitrates can be promising precursors for the CVD of high-k gate dielectric films.",

Their phase structure and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and atomic force microscope, respectively. The results showed that epitaxial BiFeO3 nanoislands could be obtained by post-annealing in the temperature range of 650-800\u00b0C, and their lateral sizes were in the range of 50-150 nm and height of 6-12 nm. With increasing the post-annealing temperatures, the morphology of BiFeO3 nanoisland in the (100) growth plane evolved from tri-angle to square, and then to long rod shape. By using piezo-force microscope, ferroelectric characteristics of single epitaxial BiFeO3 nanoisland grown on Nb-doped SrTiO3 (100) single crystal substrates with lateral size of about 50 nm and height of 12 nm was characterized. The results demonstrated that fractal ferroelectric domains existed in the single BiFeO3 nanoisland, and self-biased polarization effect was also observed within the nanoisland. This phenomenon was ascribed to interfacial stress caused by the lattice misfit between the BiFeO3 nanoisland and the SrTiO3 single crystal substrate.",

The Zr/Ti nitrate can be taken as a solid solution of the individual Zr and Ti nitrates, and the Zr/Ti molar ratio in as-deposited ZrxTi1-xO2 films is nicely consistent with that of the precursor. The Hf/Ti nitrate appears to be a mixture of the Hf and Ti nitrates and the composition of the as-deposited Hf xTi1-xO2 films depends remarkably on the heating time of precursor. Both ZrxTi1-xO2 and HfxTi1-xO2 films exhibit trading-off properties between band gap and dielectric constant, which suggests that Zr xTi1-xO2 and HfxTi 1-xO2 can be the promising candidates for gate dielectric application to improve the scalability and reduce the leakage current of the next generation complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor (CMOS) devices. \u00a9 2006 Materials Research Society.",

        "abstract": "Perovskite oxide materials display a wide spectrum of functional properties, including switchable polarization, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, and non-linear dielectric behavior. These properties are indispensable for application in electronic devices such as non-volatile memories, sensors, microactuators, infrared detectors, microwave phase filters, and so on. Recent advances in science and technology of perovskite oxide materials have resulted in the feature sizes of perovskite oxides-based electronic devices entering into nanoscale dimensions. At nanoscale perovskite oxide materials exhibit a pronounced size effect manifesting itself in a significant deviation of the properties of low-dimensional structures from the bulk and film counterparts. In the last decade low-dimensional perovskite nanosized oxides have been received much attention because of their superior physical and chemical properties. Among them, perovskite oxide nanowires are especially attractive for nanoscience studies and nanotechnology applications. Compared to other low-dimensional perovskite oxide systems, perovskite oxide nanowires are not only used as the building blocks of future nanodevices, but also they offer fundamental scientific opportunities for investigating the intrinsic size effects of physical properties. In the recent years, much progress has been made both in synthesis and physical property testing of perovskite oxide nanowires, which have a profound impact on the nanoelectronics. In this work, an overview of the state of art in perovskite oxide nanowires is presented, which covers their synthesis, property, and structural characterization. In the first part, the recent literatures for fabricating perovskite oxide nanowires with promising features, are critically reviewed. The second part deals with the recent advances on the physical property testing of perovskite oxide nanowires. The third part summarizes the recent progress on microstructural characterizations of perovskite oxide nanowires, to improve their crystalline quality, morphology and uniformity. Finally, this review concludes with some perspectives and outlook on the future developments of perovskite oxide nanowires.",

The results indicated that the domain morphology evolved from the normal micron-sized domains to herringbone domain patterns, and finally to the polar nanodoamains approximately 3~6 nm in size when the PT content was decreased from 60 to 30 mol%. The normal twin-related 90\u00b0 macrodomains are closely correlated with the normal dielectric response of the composition with higher PT content, whereas the relaxor response of the composition with lower PT content is directly attributable to nanometer domains that contain 1:1 short-range ordering on the B-site sub-lattice.

        "title": "Fabrication and characterization of Zr-rich Zr-aluminate films for high-\u03ba gate dielectric applications",
        "abstract": "Two kinds of Zr-rich Zr-aluminate films for high- \u03ba gate dielectric applications with the nominal composition of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 and (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.1 , were deposited on n-type silicon wafer by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique at different deposition conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals that the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film could remain amorphous after being rapid thermal annealed (RTA) at the temperature above 800 \u00b0C, while the other one displays some crystalline peaks at 700 \u00b0C. The energy gap calculated from optical transmittance spectrum of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film on quartz is about 6.0 eV. Sputtering depth profile of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy indicate that a Zr\u2013Si\u2013O interfacial layer was formed at the near surface of the silicon substrate. The dielectric constant of the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film has been determined to be 22.1 by measuring a Pt/(ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 /Pt MIM structure. An EOT of 1.76 nm with a leakage current density of 51.5 mA/cm 2 at 1 V gate voltage for the film deposited in N 2 were obtained. Two different pre-treatments of Si substrates prior to depositions were also carried out and compared. The results indicate that a surface-nitrided Si substrate can lead to a lower leakage current density. The amorphous Zr-rich Zr-aluminate films fabricated by PLD have promising structure and dielectric properties required for a candidate material for high- \u03ba gate dielectric applications. PACS 77.55.+f 81.15.Fg 73.40.Qv Keywords Zr-rich Zr-aluminate thin film High- \u03ba gate dielectric Pulsed laser deposition 1 Introduction With the rapid development of microelectronic technology, the dimension of semiconductor devices is scaling down. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) technology roadmap, the gate oxide thickness has reached a few nanometer range and will be lower than 2 nm for sub-0.1 \u03bcm generation in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) device applications [1] . This arouses some challenges to the traditional gate dielectric-SiO 2 , such as the reliability and the excessive direct tunneling current [2] . High permittivity (high- \u03ba ) materials are attracting great interest to replace silicon oxide, as they can be physically thicker to reduce the leakage current while achieving the same capacitance. Recent studies have focused on some simple oxides of high dielectric constant, such as TiO 2 [3] , Ta 2 O 5 [4] , HfO 2 [5] , ZrO 2 [6] and Al 2 O 3 [7] , as potential alternative gate dielectric candidates. Besides high dielectric constant, there are still some other basic requirements for high- \u03ba materials, i.e. good thermal stability on silicon wafer at high temperature, large band gap and structural homogeneity. ZrO 2 is a promising candidate for gate dielectric application due to its high permittivity (\u223c25) and good thermal stability on Si. Pure ZrO 2 , however, has a crystallization temperature lower than 500 \u00b0C. For high- \u03ba gate dielectrics, an amorphous structure is always preferred to a polycrystalline structure, as a crystalline film can induce high grain boundary leakage current and lead to non-uniformities in \u03b5 value and in film thickness. ZrO 2 also has high diffusivity of oxygen resulting in the forming of low- \u03ba interfacial SiO x layer, which decreases the whole permittivity of the film. Thus binary systems, such as (ZrO 2 ) x (SiO 2 ) 1 \u2212 x and (HfO 2 ) x (SiO 2 ) 1 \u2212 x were used to enhance the properties of the gate dielectrics. As one of the promising high- \u03ba gate dielectric candidates, Al 2 O 3 has many advantages, such as high crystallization temperature (>900 \u00b0C), low diffusivity of oxygen, large band-gap and band-offset (>2 eV) and higher \u03ba value (\u223c9) than that of SiO 2 . So the (ZrO 2 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) 1 \u2212 x binary system is possible to combine the desirable properties of the two single oxides while depressing the undesirable properties of each individual material. The (ZrO 2 ) 0.5 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.5 composition with dielectric constant of 16.8 and crystallization temperature up to 900 \u00b0C has been reported recently [8] . In order to obtain a (ZrO 2 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) 1 \u2212 x composition of higher dielectric constant with proper crystallization temperature, we try to increase to the ratio of ZrO 2 ( x value) because of its higher permittivity than that of Al 2 O 3 . Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is an effective technology for growing these thin films because of the advantages of low processing temperature, rapid conduct and compositional consistency between a target and a deposited film. In the present work, we report the microstructure and the dielectric properties of Zr-rich Zr-aluminate films deposited by PLD. 2 Experimental Two (ZrO 2 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) 1 \u2212 x ceramic targets with different Zr-rich compositions were chosen in this work. We marked C1 as the first composition which contains 80 mol% ZrO 2 in the mixture, that is (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 , and C2 as the second composition which contains 90 mol% ZrO 2 in the mixture, that is (ZrO 2 ) 0.9 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.1 . The powder of ZrO 2 (purity 99.999%) and Al 2 O 3 (purity 99.99%) prepared as the chosen mol ratio was ball-milled for 20 h, dried, ground, then pressed under 15 Mpa pressure to form a raw pallet, and finally sintered at 1250 \u00b0C for 6 h. The obtained ceramic targets were dense, crackfree and gray in color. The targets could also maintain the same stoichiometry as the mixed powder due to the very little volatility of Zr and Al. Furthermore, PLD method can hold out the same stoichiometry of the multicomponent targets in the deposited films. Hence it can be believed that the deposited Zr\u2013Al\u2013O films could follow the same composition as the chosen one previously. The targets were ablated using a KrF excimer laser system (COMPEX 201, Lambda Physik AG, 248 nm in wavelength, 30 ns in pulsed width) running at a repletion of 5 Hz with an average energy density of 1.8\u20132.0 J/cm 2 . The distance between the substrates and the targets is 8 cm. The (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 films were deposited on commercially available Pt-coated Si substrates to form MIM capacitor structure at 400 \u00b0C substrate temperature in 20 Pa oxygen ambient. After cleaned by acetone and demonized water to remove organic matters and other impurity ions adhering to the surface, the n-type Si (1 0 0) wafers with \u03c1 = 2\u20133 \u03a9cm used as substrates of the MOS structure were subjected to two types of surface pre-treatments prior to high- \u03ba deposition. One is to immerse Si wafers into hydrofluoric solution (HF: demonized water = 1:40) to remove native silicon oxide and form an H-terminated surface. The other is to load the Si wafers in a high-temperature furnace (about 1200 \u00b0C in N 2 ambient) to form a nitride surface after the native silicon oxide was removed. The leakage current comparisons of these two surface pre-treatments will be presented in this work. After the films have been deposited, Pt top electrodes with an area of 3.14 \u00d7 10 \u22124 cm 2 were deposited on the films using a shadow mask by ablating pure Pt target to achieve a MOS structure. Silver glue was then quickly spread on the back side of the Si substrates to act as bottom electrodes after SiO 2 was scraped. Rapid thermal process (RTA) at different temperature in nitrogen ambient was carried out after the deposition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to measure the thickness of the Zr\u2013Al\u2013O films. The morphology of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Optical transmittance spectrum was used to determine the band gap of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film. XPS (ESCALB MK) measurements were performed to investigate the microstructure of the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 films. The bonding energy of Al 2p, Zr 3d, O 1s and Si 2p were recorded. AES was done to investigate the composition of the film and the atomic concentrations of different elements, using Perkin-Elmer (Model PHI 550) system. Dielectric properties of the films were evaluated by a HP 4294A impedance/phase analyzer at room temperature. The leakage current characteristics of MOS structures were measured using a Keithley 236 source measurement unit. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of sample C1 and C2 films RTA-annealed at different temperature ranging from 700 to 900 \u00b0C for 3 min, respectively. All the films were deposited in 20 Pa oxygen ambient at 400 \u00b0C on n-type Si wafers. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), C1 sample films RTA at 700 and 800 \u00b0C do not show any crystalline peaks, while some crystalline peaks appear after RTA at 900 \u00b0C. As indicated in Fig. 1 (b), the crystalline peaks of C2 samples appear already after RTA at 700 \u00b0C. These diffraction peaks contain both tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO 2 phases, and the relatively stronger peak of tetragonal ZrO 2 (1 0 1) substantiates that the predominant crystalline phase is tetragonal ZrO 2 . By comparing the two figures we can conclude that C1 sample can remain amorphous up to 800 \u00b0C while C2 sample would be in a crystalline form at 700 \u00b0C. It is suggested that the addition of Al 2 O 3 in the mixture contributes to the rise of crystallization temperature. The amorphous feature of C1 sample was also confirmed by the cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image shown in Fig. 2 . We prefer an amorphous structure to a polycrystalline one in the application of high- \u03ba gate dielectrics, since the polycrystalline films have higher leakage current caused by grain boundaries serving as leakage paths. Therefore, C1 sample was chosen in the following work due to its high crystalline temperature while C2 sample was abandoned because it could not remain amorphous up to 800 \u00b0C which cannot satisfy the requirement of practical thermal treatment for MOSFET device. Fig. 3 shows the frequency dependence of dielectric constant and dielectric loss for (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film deposited at 400 \u00b0C on Pt/TiO 2 / SiO 2 /Si substrate in 20 Pa oxygen ambient without anneal process. Measurements were carried out at different frequencies ranging of 0.1\u201310 MHz at room temperature. From the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 4 , the thickness of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film was determined to be about 225 nm. According to the relation: \u03b5 r = C \u00d7 t \u03b5 0 A , the dielectric constant can be calculated. As shown in Fig. 3 , the dielectric constant of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film is about 22.1 at 1 MHz. A great increase of the dielectric constant has been shown compared with the result of 16.8 in previous work [8] . The dielectric loss is low and stable at high frequencies. Fig. 5 shows the plot of ( \u210f\u03c9\u03b1 ) 2 versus \u210f\u03c9 , where \u210f\u03c9 is the energy of photon and \u03b1 is the linear absorption coefficient. The (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film of about 200 nm thickness was prepared on crystal quartz substrate. The band energy ( E g ) of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 is obtained from the following expression: ( \u210f \u03c9 \u03b1 ) 2 = C ( \u210f \u03c9 - E g ) , where C is a constant. Extrapolating the line to intersect with the energy axis, we obtained E g value of about 6.00 eV. In order to access the bonding structure in the film and at the interfacial layer which was crucial to good performances of MOS structure, XPS was carried out using Mg K \u03b1 radiation (1253.6 eV). The (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film with about 12 nm physical thickness deposited on n-Si in 20 Pa O 2 ambient at 400 \u00b0C was sputtered by Ar. As showed in Fig. 6 (a), the upper O 1 s spectrum has two components corresponding to O\u2013Zr and O\u2013Al bonding, centered at 531.1 and 532.2 eV, respectively. The corresponding ZrO 2 bonding of Zr 3d peak at 182.1 eV and Al 2 O 3 bonding of Al 2p peak at 74.7 eV were shown in Fig. 6 (b) and (c). It can be concluded that a fully oxidized (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 component was formed in the film. After the sputtering, O 1 s peak was shifted to 533.1 eV (corresponding to Si\u2013O bonding) and Zr 3d peak was emerged at 178.5 eV (corresponding to Zr\u2013Si bonding) while no Al 2p peaks were shown. We attribute it to the possibility that Al has a lower diffusivity than that of Zr. As shown in Fig. 6 (d), one could notice the presence of Si\u2013Si bonding, centered at 99.3 eV (corresponding to Si substrate), and another component at 103.2 eV. It is suggested that an interfacial Zr\u2013Si\u2013O layer was formed by the silicon atoms migrating to the near surface being incorporated into the original Zr\u2013Al\u2013O framework. Fig. 7 displays the variation of atomic concentrations of Zr, Al, Si, O and C with sputter time obtained from AES depth profile analysis of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film deposited on n-Si in 20 Pa O 2 ambient at 400 \u00b0C. It is evident that the atomic ratio of Zr and Al is about 2:1 in the film, which indicates the component consistency between the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 target and deposited film. As shown in Fig. 7 , the concentrations of Zr and Al atomics decrease due to the formation of an interfacial layer. At the end of the sputtering, the Al atomic concentration nearly reaches zero indicating that an interfacial Zr\u2013Si\u2013O layer was formed at the near surface of the Si substrate which is in agreement with the result of XPS analysis. The typical capacitance\u2013voltage ( C \u2013 V ) characteristics of 7 nm (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 films deposited on H-terminate n-Si substrates at 400 \u00b0C in 20 Pa oxygen ambient and in 20 Pa nitrogen ambient are shown in Fig. 8 . Considering the frequency dispersion shown in Fig. 3 , we calculated the actual frequency independence capacitance from the two-frequency ( f 1 = 0.5 MHz and f 2 = 1 MHz chosen in this work) C \u2013 V curves using the method proposed by Yang and Hu [9] . From the C \u2013 V characteristics of Zr\u2013Al\u2013O MOS structure, we obtained the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) evaluated from the accumulation capacitance according to the relation [10] : t eq = \u03b5 0 \u00d7 \u03b5 SiO 2 \u00d7 A C max , where t eq represents the theoretical thickness of SiO 2 that would be required to achieve the same capacitance density as the dielectric. The EOT values of the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 films were 1.83 nm deposited in 20 Pa O 2 ambient and 1.76 nm deposited in 20 Pa N 2 ambient. Without considering the formation of interfacial layer, we could obtain another t eq value using the relation: t eq = t high - k \u03b5 SiO 2 \u03b5 high - k proposed by Devoivre et al. [11] . It indicates that a very thin interfacial layer with low dielectric constant has formed during the course of deposition which limits the lowest achievable EOT value. This may result from the low oxygen diffusivity of Al 2 O 3 in the Zr-rich Zr-aluminate system. Comparing the EOT value of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 films deposited in O 2 ambient with that of deposited in N 2 ambient, it can be obtained that N 2 ambient is helpful to achieve a smaller EOT value. The flat band voltage values were 0.71 V in O 2 ambient and 0.41 V in N 2 ambient, respectively, which indicate the presence of positive charge existing in both films. Fig. 9 illustrates the corresponding current\u2013voltage ( J \u2013 V ) characteristics of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 MOS structures. The leakage current density values of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 films are 27.2 mA/cm 2 deposited in O 2 ambient and 51.5 mA/cm 2 deposited in N 2 ambient both at +1 V gate voltage, respectively. Lower leakage current density could be obtained in O 2 ambient than in N 2 ambient maybe due to a thicker interfacial layer formed in the course of deposition in O 2 ambient. Fig. 10 demonstrates the comparative current\u2013voltage ( J \u2013 V ) characteristics of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 MOS structures with two different surface pre-treatments of Si substrates prior to high- \u03ba depositions. Both films were deposited at 400 \u00b0C in 20 Pa oxygen ambient. As shown in Fig. 10 , the leakage current density of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 film deposited on an H-terminated Si substrate is higher than the one deposited on a surface-nitride Si substrate. We propose that an interfacial layer with nitrogen incorporation formed during the deposition on a surface-nitride Si substrate can lower the leakage current density. 4 Conclusions Zr-rich Zr-aluminate thin films were deposited using pulsed laser deposition technique. Two different Zr-rich compositions of (ZrO 2 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) 1 \u2212 x targets were chosen in the beginning. After the XRD analysis of the two Zr-rich compositions we showed the composition with 80 mol% ZrO 2 to be a promising one due to better thermal stability of the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 thin film that can remain amorphous up to 800 \u00b0C. The dielectric constant of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 amorphous thin film is improved to 22.1 at 1 MHz due to higher ratio of ZrO 2 ( x = 0.8) in the (ZrO 2 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) 1 \u2212 x binary system compared with that of ( x = 0.5) in the previous work. The energy gap of (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 thin film calculated from optical transmittance spectrum is about 6.0 eV. Sputtering depth profile X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to investigate the interfacial characteristics of the (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 /n-Si stacks. The result revealed that a Zr\u2013Si\u2013O interfacial layer has formed in the near surface of Si substrate. The comparative dielectric properties of the films deposited in O 2 ambient and in N 2 ambient were shown. A MOS structure was fabricated with 7 nm (ZrO 2 ) 0.8 (Al 2 O 3 ) 0.2 thin film deposited in nitrogen ambient, which has a EOT value of 1.76 nm and a leakage current density of 51.5 mA/cm 2 . Two different pre-treatments of Si substrates prior to high- \u03ba depositions were also carried out in this work. The results indicate a surface-nitride Si substrate may lead to a lower leakage current density. Therefore, Zr-rich Zr-aluminate (80 mol% ZrO 2 ) thin films prepared by PLD technique show good thermal stability and dielectric properties, and can therefore be regarded as one of the most promising high- \u03ba gate dielectric candidates.

        "abstract": "Zr-Ti and Hf-Ti composite nitrates were successfully developed as single-source precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ZrxTi1-xO2 and HfxTi1-xO2 thin films. The Zr-Ti nitrate can be assumed as a solid solution of the individual Zr and Ti nitrates, and the Zr/Ti molar ratio in the deposited ZrxTi1-xO2 films is consistent with that in the precursor. The Hf-Ti nitrate appears to be a mixture of the Hf and Ti nitrates and the composition of the deposited HfxTi1-xO2 films depends remarkably on the heating time of precursor. Both ZrxTi1-xO2 and HfxTi1-xO2 films exhibit trade-off properties between band gap and dielectric constant. The obtained results suggest that ZrxTi1-xO2 and HfxTi1-xO2 films are promising candidates for gate dielectric application to improve the scalability and reduce the leakage current of the future complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "abstract": "SrZrO3 (SZO) thin films have been prepared on Pt-coated silicon substrates and directly on Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a Zr-Sr-O target at a substrate temperature of 400\u00b0C in 20 Pa oxygen ambient. X-ray \u03b8-2\u03b8 scans showed that the as-deposited films remain amorphous at a substrate temperature of 400\u00b0C. The dielectric constant of SZO has been determined to be in the range 24-27 for the Pt/SZO/Pt structure. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure for SZO films deposited in 20 Pa oxygen ambient and 20 Pa nitrogen ambient (SZON) indicated that incorporation of nitrogen during the substrate heating and film deposition can suppress the formation of an interfacial SiO2 layer, and the SZON films have a lower equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) than that of the SZO films. However, the leakage current on the SZON films is larger than that of the SZO films. The EOT is about 1.2 nm for a 5-nm SZON film deposited at 400\u00b0C. The leakage-current characteristics of as-deposited SZON films and SZON films post-annealed in oxygen ambient by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) have been studied comparatively. The films post-annealed with RTA have a lower leakage current than the as-deposited SZON films. Optical transmittance measurements showed that the band gap of the films is about 5.7 eV. It is proposed that SrZrO3 films prepared at 400\u00b0C are potential materials for alternative high-k gate-dielectric applications.",

        "abstract": "Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) is a well known ferroelectric material for nonvolatile memory applications. However, interfacial diffusion and reaction are the main issues when PZT films were deposited directly on silicon. One way to overcome this obstacle is to deposit a barrier layer between PZT and Si. In this work, Pt/PbZr0.53Ti0.47O3/LaAlO3/Si structure has been fabricated to study the electric properties. PbZr 0.53Ti0.47O3 films with 300 nm thickness and LaAlO3 buffer layers with 30 nm thickness were prepared by pulsed laser deposition technique on n-type Si (100) substrates at 650\u00b0C and 450\u00b0C, respectively. X-ray diffraction shows that polycrystalline PbZr 0.53Ti0.47O3 film was formed on amorphous LaAlO3 buffer layer. The Auger electron spectrometer demonstrates that LaAlO3 buffer layer effectively prevent Si and Ti, Pb interdiffusion between PZT and Si substrates. For the Pt/PbZr 0.53Ti0.47O3/LaAlO3/Si structure, the current density-voltage measurement showed a typical leakage current density of about 10-7 A/cm2 at 8 V applied voltage. Furthermore, it has been measured that the Pt/PbZr0.53Ti0.47O 3/LaAlO3/Si heterostructures exhibit ferroelectric switching properties, showing a memory window as large as 2 V under a ramp rate of 200 mV/s at 1 MHz. \u00a9 2002 Taylor & Francis.",

Temperature-dependent Raman studies reveal the phase-transition temperature of 550 \u00b0C, consistent with other reports. A new mode at 685 cm-1 is observed and ascribed to the Bi-Fe-O perovskite block. With an applied field of 105 kVcm, the leakage current density is 5.2\u00d7 10-7 A cm2, indicating the high room-temperature resistivity in the order of 1012 \u03a9 cm. With an applied external electric field of 210 kVcm, the remnant polarization and coercive field of the films are measured to be 6.4 \u03bcC cm2 and 112 kVcm, respectively. The nonvolatile polarization of the films decreases about 15% of the initial value after 7.2\u00d7 109 switching cycles. As for the dielectric properties, at 0.1 MHz, the measured dielectric constant and loss tangent are 172 and 0.024, respectively.

TiO2 thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Optimum parameters have been identified for the growth of high-quality TiO2 films. At 5 Pa of oxygen ambient pressure, rutile TiO2 films with high [1 1 0] orientation were formed at substrate temperature of 700\u00b0C. At room temperature (30\u00b0C) and 5 \u00d7 10-4Pa base vacuum, rutile TiO2 films with a preferred [1 1 0] orientation were also obtained on GaAs(1 0 0) substrates by PLD. Surface morphology of the films showed marked dependence on the substrate temperature. The grain size and their surface roughness increased with raising substrate temperature. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The analysis results of X-ray diffraction showed that the as-deposited BNT films are amorphous, and the amorphous state is stable against a postannealing at temperature up to 850\u00b0C. The dielectric constant of the BNT films has been determined to be about 80 with a low loss tan \u03b4 of about 0.006 at 1 MHz. The frequency dependence of the capacitance-voltage characteristics of BNT metal-insulator-metal capacitors is investigated. With the frequency increasing, the BNT capacitors showed gradually enhanced capacitor nonlinearity, which can be attributed to the Pt/BNT interface traps. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Pt top electrodes on metalorganic derived SBT films were deposited by sputtering with a shadow mask. Well-saturated hysteresis loops of Pt/SBT/Pt capacitors could be achieved after 750\u00b0C postanneal, while the as deposited capacitors exhibit large leakage current. This is ascribed to morphology change of the Pt/SBT interface during postanneal. Interfacial diffusion increases with increasing postanneal time. XPS quantitative analysis shows that 7% of atoms in 50nm-thick Pt top electrodes are Bi atoms after postanneal at 750\u00b0C for 600 s. Remanent polarization decreases with postanneal time from 11.3 \u03bcC/cm 2 to 7.5 \u03bcC/cm2, accompanied with the increase of apparent coercive voltage. The voltage drop across the interfacial layer is found to increase from 0.21 V to 0.36 V. \u00a9 2001 Taylor & Francis.",

Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N 2 was performed. X-ray diffraction indicated that the films annealed at 800\u00a0\u00b0C remained amorphous. Differential thermal analysis revealed that amorphous Zr silicate crystallized at 830\u00a0\u00b0C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that RTA annealing of Zr silicate films at 900\u00a0\u00b0C led to phase separation. The dielectric constant has been determined to be about 18.6 at 1\u00a0MHz by measuring the Pt/Zr silicate/Pt MIM structure. The equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOTs) and the leakage-current densities of films with 6-nm physical thickness deposited in O 2 and N 2 ambient were investigated. An EOT of 1.65\u00a0nm and a leakage current of 31.4\u00a0mA/cm 2 at 1-V gate voltage for the films prepared in N 2 and RTA annealed in N 2 at 800\u00a0\u00b0C were obtained. An amorphous Zr-rich Zr silicate film fabricated by PLD looks to be a promising candidate for future high-k gate-dielectric applications.",

A structural transition from rhombohedral to pseudo-cubic structures appeared around x = 0.33, and the formation of impurity phase of Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 was effectively depressed by doping BaTiO 3 . Dielectric constants of x BaTiO 3 \u2013(1 \u2212 x )BiFeO 3 solid solutions decreased with increasing the frequency, and the degree of decrease was related to the doping content of BaTiO 3 . Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the ferroelectric domain configurations in the multiferroic BiFeO 3 \u2013BaTiO 3 solid solutions with rhombohedral symmetry, exhibited a wavy character whereas a predominant intricate domain structure with fluctuating mottled contrast was observed in the multiferroic BiFeO 3 \u2013BaTiO 3 solid solution with pseudo-cubic phase structure. The presence of 1/2{1 1 1} superlattice spots in the selected area electron diffraction patterns taken from the multiferroic BiFeO 3 \u2013BaTiO 3 solid solutions with rhombohedral symmetry indicated that the ordered regions have a doubled perovskite unit cell.

Dielectric properties BiFeO 3 \u2013BaTiO 3 solid solution Ferroelectric domain configurations Multiferroic ceramics 1 Introduction Multiferroic materials have been received much attention because of their potential applications for new types of electronic devices (e.g., multiple-state memories and new date-storage media) [1,2] . An important number of magnetoelectric muliferroics has the general chemical formula ABO 3 and crystallizes in a perovskite or perovskite-related structure [3] . Perovskite bismuth ferrite BiFeO 3 (BFO), as one of the single-phase magnetoelectric multiferroics, it is ferroelectric with the Curie temperature T C \u2248 830 \u00b0C and antiferromagnetic having the N\u00e9el temperature T N = 310 \u00b0C, therefore, it is an interesting model muliferroics, perhaps the only material that exhibits spontaneous ferroelectric and magnetic ordering above room temperature [2] . However, since the discovery of BFO in the 1960s, difficult synthesis of pure BFO and its large current leakage have hampered its practical applications. Actually, only low values of the polarization and of the dielectric constant were determined at room temperature, mainly due to the semiconducting properties of BFO, which does not allow proper electrical poling and leads to high dielectric losses. Several techniques such as solid-state reaction, co-precipitation method, and soft chemical route, were used to synthesize pure BFO. Meanwhile, the solid solutions of BFO formed with other ABO 3 perovskites such as BaTiO 3 (BTO) and PbTiO 3 with good dielectric properties, were also synthesized in order to reduce the leakage current and to achieve high resistivity. Recently, BTO\u2013BFO solid solution has been prepared by classical solid-state reaction method, and their magnetic and dielectric properties were reported [4\u20136] . However, the problems of dielectric losses in the solid solution of BTO\u2013BFO were only partially solved and the reported data are often \u201cauthor dependent\u201d. In the present work, we report on the dielectric properties of perovskite multiferroic x BTO\u2013(1 \u2212 x )BFO ( x = 0.1\u20130.33) solid solutions synthesized by solid-state reaction. The ferroelectric domain configurations in the multiferroic BTO\u2013BFO solid solutions were also examined by bright- and dark-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction technique. 2 Experimental The perovskite solid solutions of x BTO\u2013(1 \u2212 x )BFO ( x = 0.10\u20130.33) were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The stoichiometric amounts of starting materials, Bi 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , BaCO 3 , and TiO 2 were mixed and ball-milled for 24 h in polyethylene container with zirconia balls. After drying at 120 \u00b0C, the mixed powders were then calcined at 750 \u00b0C for 4 h. Subsequently, the calcined samples were pressed into disc shape and pre-sintered at 820\u2013850 \u00b0C for 2 h with intermediate grindings. The crushed powder was then mixed with appropriate amount of polyvinyl alcohol, and then pressed into cylindrical pellets with a diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm. Final sintering temperatures were increased with the increasing content of BTO taking into account the fact that BTO reacts at fairly high temperatures. The samples were finally sintered at between 930 and 945 \u00b0C for 1 h. The crystal structures of the sintered pellets were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuK\u03b1 radiation. A typical scan rate was 0.02\u00b0/s, and the 2 \u03b8 range was 10\u201380\u00b0. For electrical properties characterization, the sintered samples were ground to obtain parallel faces, and the two faces were then coated with Ag\u2013Pd paint as electrodes. The dielectric properties of the sintered ceramics were measured as a function of temperature and frequency using a HP4192A impedance analyzer controlled by a computer. Ferroelectric domain configurations were examined by a field-emission TEM (FE-TEM, FEI Tecnai F20) operated at 200 kV. The TEM specimens were prepared from the polycrystalline samples by mechanical grinding, dimple grinding, and subsequently ion-milling. 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 (a) shows the XRD patterns of x BTO\u2013(1 \u2212 x )BFO ( x = 0.10\u20130.33) solid solutions prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The XRD patterns were indexed on the basis of data of BFO (rhombohedral, space group R3c) and showed rhombohedral distortion. A few small traces of impurity were observed in the case of x = 0.25\u20130.33, which were found to be those of Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 (labeled by a star in Fig. 1 (a)). With increasing the concentration of BTO from x = 0.10 to 0.33, the (0 0 6)/(2 0 2) diffraction peaks shifted towards the lower angle, as shown in Fig. 1 (b) in detail, and the decrease of rhombohedral distortion was also observed, as demonstrated by gradual disappearance of the splitting of the diffraction peaks such as (0 0 6) and (2 0 2) peaks in Fig. 1 (b). The lattice parameter ( a ) and rhombohedral angle ( \u03b1 ) as a function of the increase of the BTO concentration were shown in Fig. 2 (a) , and the change of volume of the unit cell was demonstrated in Fig. 2 (b). It was noticed that the rhombohedral angle, \u03b1 approached to 90\u00b0 (a specific value to the pseudo-cubic phase) as the concentration of BTO reached x = 0.33, and the lattice parameter a increased linearly with the increase of the BTO concentration. Similar phenomenon was also observed in the volume of the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 2 (b), which is ascribed to that the ionic radii of Ba 2+ (135 pm) is much larger than that of Bi 3+ (108 pm), and also the ionic radii of Ti 4+ (68 pm) larger than that of Fe 3+ (64 pm). These results are in agreement the data previously reported by Kumar et al. [4] . Fig. 3 shows the dielectric properties of the BTO\u2013BFO solid solutions as a function of the measured frequency. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) the dielectric constants of all the BTO\u2013BFO solid solutions had a general tendency to decrease with increasing the frequency. Such a decrease of the dielectric constant in the low-frequency region below 100 kHz, is caused by space charge polarization, due to the inevitable oxygen vacancies, A-site vacancies, and the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ coexistence in the perovskite BTO\u2013BFO multiferroic ceramics. As observed in Fig. 3 , the BTO\u2013BFO solid solution with x = 0.15 had much larger dielectric constant as compared to the other solid solutions ( x = 0.20\u20130.33) (see Fig. 3 (a)), and its dielectric loss (tan \u03b4 ) also had a much high value (0.2\u20130.3) (see Fig. 3 (b)). That was attributed to the space charge polarization induced by the structural defects such as oxygen vacancies, A-site vacancies, and the coexistence of Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ions in this solid solution. On the other hand, the dielectric constants of the BTO\u2013BFO solid solutions with x = 0.20\u20130.25, were much reduced as compared to x = 0.15, which might be originated from the reduced space charge concentration, and consequently the reduced values of the dielectric losses (see Fig. 3 (b)). As further increasing the BTO content ( x = 0.30\u20130.33), the increase of the dielectric constant could be ascribed to the larger dielectric constant of BTO (>1000) than the BFO (<150). The rhombohedral (ferroelectric) domains in BTO\u2013BFO multiferroic ceramics were examined by bright- and dark-field TEM images and SAED techniques. Fig. 4 (a) shows the [ 1 1 _ 0 ] zone axis SAED pattern obtained from the 0.25BTO\u20130.75BFO multiferroic ceramic sample at room temperature. The diffraction spots in the SAED pattern are indexed based on the basis of the high-temperature cubic Pm3m structure. As shown in the SAED pattern, besides the (strong) allowed reflections originating from the cubic perovskite structure, extra (weak) superlattice reflections ( F -spots) appear at positions of ( h + 1/2, k + 1/2, l + 1/2) from the fundamental reflections. The intensity of the superstructure spot along the [1 1 1] axes varies from one crystal to another one. The existence of the F -spots clearly confirms that the ordered regions have a doubled perovskite unit cell. Fig. 4 (b) and (c) shows the bright- and dark-field TEM images of the domain structures observed in the 0.25BTO\u20130.75BFO multiferroic ceramic sample. The dark-field TEM image was obtained using the (1 1 0) fundamental spot. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 (b) and (c), wavy rhombohedral (ferroelectric) domain structures were observed in the 0.25BTO\u20130.75BFO multiferroic ceramics with a rhombohedral phase structure. The lengths of the domains were about 0.16 \u03bcm and their widths were about 20 nm. Furthermore, the domain walls do not seem to prefer any one set of crystallographic planes, and their waviness was ascribed to the continuous bending of the domain orientation between various equivalent directions on a length scale of 0.16 \u03bcm. Similar domain structures were reported for the bismuth and zinc-modified Pb(Ni 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 \u2013PbZrO 3 \u2013PbTiO 3 piezoelectric ceramics with a rhombohedral symmetry [7] . With increasing the BTO content up to 33 mol%, the phase structure of BTO\u2013BFO multiferroic ceramics changed from rhombohedral phase to a pseudo-cubic phase, and their domain morphology exhibited a predominant intricate domain structure with fluctuating mottled contrast, as shown in Fig. 5 (a dark-field TEM image formed by the (1 0 0) diffraction spot). 4 Conclusions Perovskite multiferroic x BaTiO 3 \u2013(1 \u2212 x )BiFeO 3 solid solutions with 0.20 \u2264 x \u2264 0.33 were successfully prepared by the solid-state reaction. X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that a structural transition from rhombohedral to pseudo-cubic phase structures appeared around x = 0.33, and the BaTiO 3 -doping could effectively depress the formation of impurity phase of Bi 2 Fe 4 O 9 . The dielectric constants of x BaTiO 3 \u2013(1 \u2212 x )BiFeO 3 solid solutions decreased with the frequency, and the degree of decrease was related to the content of BaTiO 3 . Ferroelectric domain configurations in the multiferroic BiFeO 3 \u2013BaTiO 3 solid solutions with rhombohedral symmetry, exhibited a wavy character. The SAED patterns revealed extra (weak) superlattice reflections ( F -spots) appearing at positions of ( h + 1/2, k + 1/2, l + 1/2) from the fundamental reflections, indicating that the ordered regions have a doubled perovskite unit cell. In the multiferroic BiFeO 3 \u2013BaTiO 3 solid solution with pseudo-cubic phase structure, a predominant intricate domain structure with fluctuating mottled contrast was observed.

        "abstract": "SrZrO 3 thin films were prepared by sol\u2013gel to explore the possibility of SrZrO 3 to be used as a gate material for MOSFET application. Films were spin-coated layer by layer on Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si and silicon substrates and then annealed by rapid thermal annealing at different temperatures ranging form 500 to 900 \u00b0C. The energy gap calculated form optical transmittance spectrum of SrZrO 3 thin films on quartz is about 4.63 eV. Dielectric constant of SrZrO 3 film is bout 25 determined by c \u2013 f measurement and the film thickness. Microstructure and surface morphology of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The film maintained amorphous until being annealed at a temperature above 800 \u00b0C. Keywords SrZrO 3 High- k Gate dielectric Sol\u2013gel 1 Introduction Thin silicon dioxide films are commonly used as dielectric media for gates and capacitors in very large-integrated circuits. However, as device scaling continues, SiO 2 will begin to have some fundamental limitations as gate dielectric. Once the SiO 2 thickness is reduced to 7\u201310 \u00c5 range, the films may exhibit high leakage currents and relatively low breakdown voltages associated with high pinhole densities and enhanced tunneling [1] . Since technology roadmaps predict the need for 20 \u00c5 and below gate dielectrics in the near future, many alternative gate dielectrics have been studied. The alternative dielectric materials need to have a dielectric constant higher than SiO 2 so that a physically thicker film can still have a thin equivalent electrical thickness. The increase in physical thickness will lead to decrease tunneling currents. Metal-oxides with high dielectric constant (high- k ) have the potential to extend the scaling of transistor gate capacitance beyond that of ultrathin SiO 2 . Many materials have been investigated to replace silicon dioxide or silicon nitride as a possible gate dielectric, including Ta 2 O 5 [2] , ZrO 2 [3] , Y 2 O 3 [4] , SrTiO 3 [5] , etc. SrZrO 3 -based perovskite oxides are known to exhibit proton conductivity at elevated temperatures. Their ability to conduct protons makes them potential candidates for electrolytes in some novel electrochemical devices such as solid oxide fuel cells and hydrogen or steam sensors [6] . But little work has been done on its possibility to be used as a gate material. Sol\u2013gel is one of the most promising techniques because of its precise control of composition, large area deposition and low cost. So we prepared SrZrO 3 films by sol\u2013gel to preliminarily explore the possibility of SrZrO 3 to be used as a gate material. 2 Experimental Zirconium n -propoxide solution and strontium acetate were used to synthesis the precursor. The precursor was spin-coated onto Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si or silicon substrates at 3000 rpm and then baked at 200 \u00b0C on a hot plate for 4 min in air to remove most organic. The dried films were annealed by rapid thermal annealing at the temperature ranging from 500 to 900 \u00b0C for 5 min. This process was repeated several times to obtain the desired film thickness. Top electrodes of Pt were sputtered through a shadow mask with a diameter of 0.2 mm for electrical measurement. Optical transmittance spectrum was used to determine the band gap of SrZrO 3 . Dielectric properties of the films were tested by precise impedance analyzer (4294A, Agilent). Microstructure and morphology of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The composition of SrZrO 3 film was determined by electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). 3 Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the thermogravimetric analysis plot of the SrZrO 3 gel during heating up to 1200 \u00b0C. The SrZrO 3 gel had a major weight loss between 170 and 500 \u00b0C where evaporation of propanol and the decomposition of the acetate and propylate took place. Above 1000 \u00b0C, SrZrO 3 was not stable. XRD patterns of the films annealed at different temperature are shown in Fig. 2 . The films remained amorphous until being annealed at a temperature above 800 \u00b0C. At 800 and 900 \u00b0C, two tiny diffraction peaks of SrZrO 3 appeared. So, amorphous SrZrO 3 film has fairly good thermal stability, which is beneficial to decrease leakage current comparing to crystal films. Surface morphology of the films annealed at different temperature ranging form 500 to 900 \u00b0C were investigated by SEM, as shown in Fig. 3 . Films annealed at 800 and 900 \u00b0C were consisted of tiny vague crystal grains and were smooth and compact, which consisted with the XRD results. Furthermore, the morphology changed little with the increasing temperature. Fig. 3 (d) shows the cross-section image of the SrZrO 3 film deposited at 700 \u00b0C on Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si substrate. The thickness of three-layered film is about 180 nm. The ratio of Zr/Sr of the film determined by EPMA is 1:0.91, which is close to the stoichiometry of precursor. Fig. 4 shows the plot of (\u210f \u03c9\u03b1 ) 2 versus \u210f \u03c9 , where, \u210f \u03c9 is the energy of photon and \u03b1 the linear absorption coefficient of the film obtained from optical transmittance spectrum of \u223c400 nm thick SrZrO 3 prepared on crystal quartz substrate. The band gap ( E g ) of SrZrO 3 is obtained from the following expression: (\u210f\u03c9\u03b1) 2 =C(\u210f\u03c9\u2212E g ) where C is a constant. Extrapolating the line to intersect with the energy axis, we obtained E g value of about 4.63 eV. Fig. 5 shows the curves of capacitance and dielectric loss as a function of frequency of metal-oxide-metal capacitor. The film was prepared at 700 \u00b0C with the thickness of about 240 nm. From the thickness of the film obtained from cross-section image and capacitance obtained from c \u2013 f curve, we calculated the dielectric constant of SrZrO 3 film is about 25. Capacitance-applied voltage ( C \u2013 V ) curve of metal-oxide-semiconductor structure was measured at a frequency of 1 MHz, as shown in Fig. 6 . The film thickness was about 240 nm. For the inherent shortcoming of sol\u2013gel method, we cannot prepare ultrathin films and control interface of the films. The equivalent oxide thickness obtained from the C \u2013 V curve is larger compared to the thickness of the film. SiO 2 interlayer between the film and silicon substrate is inevitable during film preparation by sol\u2013gel method. Flat band voltage for the C \u2013 V curve was calculated at \u22120.4 V, which suggests the presence of positive charges in the film. 4 Conclusion In conclusion, we explored the possibility of SrZrO 3 to be used as high- k material. Amorphous SrZrO 3 films were successfully prepared on Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si and silicon substrates by sol\u2013gel. The energy gap and dielectric properties of the films are 4.63 and 25 eV, respectively. For the inherent shortcoming of sol\u2013gel method, we cannot prepare ultrathin films and control interface of the films. Detailed study will be carried on by pulsed laser deposition.

        "abstract": "BaTiO3 (BT) nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal method at 220 \u00b0C, and their crystal structure, morphology, and surface structure were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), respectively. The results of XRD and Raman spectroscopy indicated that the BT nanocrystals are of tetragonal phase at room temperature. SEM and TEM images showed that the larger Ba/Ti molar ratios in the precursors led to the formation of larger nanocrystals with a cubic morphology. HRTEM images revealed that the cubic nanocrystals were bound by their {1 0 0} faces. A core-shell surface structure was observed in the nanocrystals, where the shell layer was cubic with a thickness in the range 2-3.5 nm, and the core was a bulk tetragonal. The interface structure between the shell and the core was coherent without any interfacial dislocation. At rough edges of the nanocrystals, their {1 1 0} edges were faceted by {1 0 0} planes in a form of few atomic layers wide steps, showing some degree of ledge-kink reconstruction. These microstructural results enable ones to achieve nanocrystals with controlled size and morphology. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) thin films have been prepared on fused quartz substrates by using metalorgnic decomposition (MOD) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that films are polycrystalline in nature at annealing temperature of 750\u00b0C. The original optical energy band gap Eg obtained is about 4.57 eV. The changes of the Eg values of SBT films in H2-contained ambient (forming gas, 5%H 2 + 95%N2) at different annealing temperature are investigated by measurement of optical transmittance. The reductive atmosphere and temperature exhibit strong effects on the Eg values and the roughness of SBT films. Some significant changes of Eg values for the films are observed at 450\u00b0C and 500\u00b0C in the forming gas ambient. The Eg values increase from 4.57eV to 4.81eV and 4.92eV, respectively. These results could be attributed to degradation of polarization of SBT films, which being induced by Bi deficiency. Forming gas ambient has played an important role in the reductive reaction. \u00a9 2010 SPIE.",

The effect of partial switching on fatigue was studied. An increase of nonvolatile polarization (Pnv) was observed over the initial period of fatigue when the capacitor was fully switched by the applied bipolar cycles. Fatigue increases with decreasing applied field and pulse width. These support the idea that fatigue in SBT may be viewed as a competition between domain-wall pinning and field-assisted unpinning. Partial switching caused by small field and short pulse width enhances charge trapping at domain walls, thus increasing fatigue. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

Structural and electrical characteristics of crystalline BLTx films were studied as functions of La composition. Structure characterization was conducted by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The lowest lattice vibration mode around 116 cm-1 showed softening with increasing lanthanum composition. Surface morphology of BLTx films were recorded by scanning electron microscopy. BLTx films have saturated hysteresis loops with remnant polarization of 9.7, 12.3, and 4.5 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively, for x = 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 films. BLT0.75 films showed fatigue-free behavior over 250 kV/cm, 50 kHz cycling, which could be compared with that of SrBi2Ta2O9 thin films. Fatigue resistance decrease at lower cycling field. The field dependence of fatigue property was discussed briefly in terms of competition between domain pinning and field-assisted unpinning.",

        "abstract": "The steady-state coupling equations of directional solidification of Al-Al2Cu (e=0.94), Sn-Pb (e=0.59)and Al-Si (e=0.17)eutectics have been solved numerically. The profiles, splitting features and supercooling of the solidifying interface were investigated in detail as functions of the lamellar spacing. It was found that when supercooling, ?T0, at the three-phase conjunction point reaches its minimum value, min (?T0), the solidifying interface profile of one lamellar phase was in the critical splitting state (marginally stable state) and that of the other lamella was super-stable. Langer's marginal stability theory of lamellar eutectic solidification with a planar interface was extended to the case with a curved interface, and a geometrical model of the spacing selection has been suggested (critical splitting state of one lamella's solidifying interface). The general scaling law of the spacing, derived according to this theory, was found to be consistent with the similarity law recently derived by Kassner and Misbah; it is also supported by experimental results. Another geometrical model of the spacing selection was found, where the solidifying interface profile of one lamella became split and other lamella's profile was in the critical splitting state. The experimental data for directional solidification of Al-Si eutectic showed that the irregular eutectics have a spacing selected according to this mode.",

LAO films were deposited on n-Si substrates by low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) films were prepared as ferroelectric layers at a low processing temperature of 650 \u00b0C by a metalorganic decomposition method. The MOCVD-derived LAO buffer layer shows an amorphous structure, relatively high dielectric constant, and good electrical properties. Au/SBT/LAO/n-Si exhibits a larger counterclockwise C-V memory window of 3.7 V and a lower leakage-current density of 2.5\u00d710-8 A/cm2 at an applied voltage of 10 V. It has been confirmed that the hysteresis loop is caused by ferroelectricity. The Auger electron spectrometry depth profile indicates that the introduction of the LAO buffer layer prevents the interfacial diffusion between SBT and the Si substrate effectively and improves the interface quality. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2004.",

Layered pcrovskite BLT and BPT films can be achieved by 180 s annealing at a temperature as low as 650\u00b0C. Both BPT and BLT films are composed of closely packed spherical grains. BPT shows larger remnant polarization (Pr) and smaller coercive field. The Pr values of 700\u00b0C annealed BLT and BPT films are 18.3 \u03bcC/cm2 and 20.5 \u03bcC/cm 2, respectively, while BLT films show better-saturated hysteresis loops. The leakage current density of BPT films is significantly (about one order) lower than that of BLT. The dielectric properties of BLT and BPT films were measured and compared. Both films exhibit large dielectric constant and small loss tangent Under bipolar switching cycles, BLT films showed little polarization reduction but a 30% polarization loss was observed for BPT films after 2\u00d7109 cycles. \u00a9 2002 Taylor & Francis.",

A systematic variation in the domain morphology was observed as the compositions move from the ferroelectric tetragonal (FT) to pseudocubic (Fpc) phases, and then to the rhombohedral (FR) phase. Wedged-shaped domains with misoriented {110} domain walls and mixed with herringbone-like configuration are the main features of the ferroelectric domains in the FT and Fpc phases, whereas in the compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between the Fpc and FR phases, the characteristic feature of the ferroelectric domains is an intricate domain structure exhibiting a fluctuating mottled contrast. However, the domain boundaries in the F R phase exhibit a wavy character. The domain feature for the compositions at/near the MPB between the FT and FR phases with high property coefficients is a 90\u00b0 domain texture mixed with an intricate domain structure. The different domain configurations observed in the FT and FR phases are due to their different accommodations of local elastic strain fields. The piezoelectric soft behavior and a normal-relaxor ferroelectric behavior transition observed in this piezoelectric ceramic system are closely related to the above domain morphology evolution as increasing the PNN content or the Zr/(Zr+Ti) ratio. \u00a9 2007 The American Ceramic Society.",

The spinodal decomposition of CuCo alloys has been studied by using computer simulation for the Fourier transformation of the nonlinear diffusion equation. The simulation shows that the decomposition can be characterized by three periods, i.e. the strong wavelength modulation of the composition profile in the initial stage; the amplitude growth of the nominal composition profile in the mediate stage; and the regularization and evenly wavelength recovery of the composition profile in the final stage. A strong dependence of the decomposition kinetics on temperature has been revealed but the wavelength of the modulated structure only has a weak dependence on temperature.",

The BZT-xBCT thin film exhibited a high remnant polarization of 22.15 \u03bcC cm-2 with a large coercive field of 68.06 kV cm-1. The resultant gel is calcined at various elevated temperatures and studied with FTIR/XRD/Raman/DSC- TGA/AFM/SEM techniques for gel composition, crystallization, phase transition, thermochemistry and the morphology of the film. Although the room temperature crystal structure of the BZT-xBCT nanocrystals appears to be a standard perovskite structure by conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy demonstrates the presence of non-centrosymmetric regions arising from the off-centering of the titanium (zirconium) atoms. The Raman spectra findings demonstrate the degree by which the tetragonal phase grows with the increase of calcining temperature in BZT-0.5BCT, and the characteristic ferroelectric- ferroelectric phase transition in BZT-xBCT while going through the MPB process. The structural and constituent evolution for the conversion process from gel to ceramic, as well as the formation mechanism of the BZT-0.5BCT crystallite, were also elucidated. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.",

Small-angle (8.2\u00b0) [001] tilt grain boundaries with a boundary plane close to the (110) plane exhibit partial GBDs separated by stacking faults. The dissociated grain-boundary structures have twice the number of GBDs and interdislocation core channel width smaller than that Frank's geometrical rule predicts. At the equilibrium, the repulsive elastic force between partial dislocations is balanced by an attractive force produced by the formation of a stacking fault between the partials. Based on this, the stacking fault energy is evaluated to be 0.27-0.29 J/m2. The relationship between the leakage current of SBT films and dissociation of GBDs is also discussed. \u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

The LMR increases with decreasing temperature and reaches a value of 110% at 200 K under a magnetic field of 70 kOe. The observed magnetoresistance is proportional to carrier mobility due to identical temperature dependencies. The microstructures of AGT films annealed at different temperature are investigated by TEM observations. The observed LMR effect is resulting from the inhomogeneous distribution of conductivity caused by highly conductive Ag 2Te and GeTe 4 precipitates, which generate a current distortion in the surrounding amorphous silver-poor Ag-Ge-Te matrix. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is demonstrated by TEM observation and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns that a clear interface between the rhombohedral and pseudocubic phases exists in the interdiffusion layer.

Their phase structure and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, respectively. The results showed that epitaxial multiferroic BiFeO3 nanoislands were obtained via post-annealing process in the temperature range of 650 - 800\u00b0C, and their lateral sizes were in the range of 50 - 160 nm and height of 6 -12 nm. With increasing the post-annealing temperature, the morphology of BiFeO3 nanoisland in the (100) growth plane evolved from tri-angled to squared, and then to plated shapes. By using piezo-force microscopy, ferroelectric characteristics of a single epitaxial BiFeO3 nanoisland (with lateral size of \u223c 50 nm and height of 12 nm) grown on Nb-doped SrTiO3 (100) single crystal substrate, was characterized. The results demonstrated that fractal ferroelectric domains existed in the single BiFeO3 nanoisland, and self-biased polarization was also observed within this multiferroic nanoisland. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the interfacial stress caused by the lattice misfit between the BiFeO3 nanoisland and the SrTiO3 single crystal substrate. \u00a9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications.",

The thickness effects on the structure, surface morphology, and electrical properties of SBT thin films were studied and discussed. Structure and surface morphology were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscope. The electrical properties were characterized by the measurements of hysteresis, capacitance, and pulse switching. The crystalline structure, grain size, and electrical properties do not depend on film thickness when films are less than 440 nm thick. A larger grain size is observed for films thicker than 440 nm, which results in a larger remnant polarization. The thickness dependence of the coercive voltage and reciprocal capacitance can be explained by an interfacial layer model. The thickness-independent coercive field and dielectric constant, calculated from the interfacial layer model, are around 19 kV/cm and 343, respectively. Nonvolatile polarization (Pnv), obtained from pulse-switching measurements, increases with the applied electric field and finally saturates with a slight thickness effect. The relaxation of the remnant polarization that occurs at zero-voltage intervals between the pulses and the thickness-independent behavior of Pnv are explained based on depolarization fields within the ferroelectric due to nonswitching interfacial layers at the film/electrode interfaces. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

The voltage shifts of imprinted P - V hysteresis loops increased with the increase of aging time, which indicated the strengthening of the internal bias created by the thermal treatment.

        "abstract": "Using Zn targets in a 100 Pa oxygen ambient at substrate temperatures of 275-425\ufffd\ufffdC, completely (0001)-textured ZnO thin films have been deposited on (0001)-oriented \ufffd\ufffd-SiO2 substrates by the pulsed laser reactive ablation technique. The effects of deposition parameters on the microstructures of the films have been analysed. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) 2\ufffd\ufffd angle of the (0002) X-ray reflection reached its minimum of 0.320\ufffd\ufffd for the ZnO films grown at substrate temperatures between 325 and 375\ufffd\ufffdC. The films proved to be dense, smooth, transparent and colourless. Thick lamina-like grains were observed in the ZnO films by scanning electron microscopy. The reflective indices of the films vs. wavelength calculated from the measured oscillated optical transmittance were close to those of bulk ZnO crystal. The band gap of the piezoelectric semiconductor ZnO was estimated as 3.28 eV. Favourable optical waveguiding properties of the films have been demonstrated by the observation of sharp m-lines from the transverse electric (TE) modes excited by the prism-coupling method.",

The results indicated that the domain morphology evolved from the normal micron-sized domains to herringbone domain patterns, and finally to the polar nanodoamains approximately 3\u223c6 nm in size when the PT content was decreased from 60 to 30 mol%. The normal twin-related 90\u00b0 macrodomains are closely correlated with the normal dielectric response of the composition with higher PT content, whereas the relaxor response of the composition with lower PT content is directly attributable to nanometer domains that contain 1:1 short-range ordering on the B-site sub-lattice. A model is proposed to describe the effect of the PbTiO 3 content on the ferroelectric domain morphology evolution in the system.",

The dependence of the sintering products on the sintering temperatures revealed that single-phased BiFeO 3 ceramic was synthesized at 880 \u00b0C using this rapid sintering technique. The as-prepared BiFeO3 sample shows a high resistivity of 6.7 \u00d7 1010\u03a9 cm at an external electric field of 100 kVcm-1. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurement verified that the high resistance BiFeO3 ceramic presented an antiferromagnetic characterization. \u00a9 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The effects of deposition temperature, ambient oxygen pressure, and etching of the substrate on the structural properties of the films were studied. It is found that the crystalline orientations of the MgO films are determined at the initial deposition stage by the substrate temperature only. The ambient pressure during deposition and etching of the Si substrates only effect the crystalline quality. Both (110)- and (111)-oriented films show granular grain structures. The (100)-oriented films grown on etched Si substrates display similar granular structures. Those deposited on nonetched Si substrates, however, reveal distinctive columnar grains. The observed phenomena are discussed based on the theory of crystal growth. The mechanism of the orientation selection is attributed to the energy balance between the surface and the interface energies. The varied grain structures are explained by considering the mobility of adatoms in different situations. \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "(001)-oriented PbTiO 3 thin films have been grown in situ on La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 SrTiO 3 by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition under reduced pressure, while thin films of La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 (LSCO), which is an oxide perovskite metallic material, have been deposited on SrTiO 3 substrates by pulse laser deposition. The optimum growth conditions of (001)-oriented PbTiO 3 thin films were established. The natures of the films are characterized by X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The acoustic transducers operating at 9.58 GHz were made based on the PbTiO 3 /LSCO/SrTiO 3 heterostructures. The characterization of PbTiO 3 thin films shows that the LSCO, at least in some applications such as piezoelectric transducers and resonators, is a suitable electrode material.",

The substitution of Pb for Ba in (Ba,Sr) Ti O 3 (BST) system has been revealed to raise the transition temperature close to room temperature (RT) and enhance the tuning property. It is proposed that nanopolar regions would occur in the films in the paraelectric state at RT, arising from the addition of Pb2+ into the A site of pervoskite structure of BST. This induces the relaxor behavior and diffuse phase transition. Hence, low temperature-dependent tunability is obtained due to the broadening of dielectric constant peak. These results demonstrated that Pb substitution could be a simple and effective method to obtain high tunability and good temperature stability simultaneously. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics.",

Bi 1-xSm xFeO 3 (x=0-0.12) shows a rhombohedral-like phase, ferroelectric polarization of >17.8 \u03bcCcm 2, piezoelectric d33 value of >35 pCN at room temperature. Bi 1-xSm xFeO 3 (x=0.1250.2) has a ferroelectric triclinic phase and an anti-polar orthorhombic phase together at room temperature, and Bi 0.75Sm 0.25FeO 3 is mainly composed of a non-polar orthorhombic phase. After the polarized Bi 1-xSm xFeO 3 (x=00.165) was annealed at various high temperatures, the d33 evolution supports ferroelectric component exist above 500 \u00b0C. Raman spectra suggests that the main component of Bi 0.875Sm 0.125FeO 3 does not keep a rhombohedral ferroelectric phase above 400 \u00b0C, thus its ferroelectric traits at high temperature should be due to ferroelectric clusters embedded in orthorhombic phase. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The SFO thin films were (110) oriented. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the surface of SFO thin film has strong gas absorption capability. The resistance versus temperature has been measured in the temperature range from 77 K to 300 K. The SFO thin film showed typical semiconductive property. Dependence of resistance of SFO thin film on oxygen pressure was measured and result showed that the SFO thin film had better oxygen sensitive property.",

Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) indicated that above N\u00e9el temperature the resonance shows paramagnetic characters and under N\u00e9el temperature it shows antimagnetic characters . The spontaneous polarization and coercive field of PFN at room temperature are 11.5 \u03bcC/cm2 and 3.04 kV/cm, respectively. Dielectric measurement showed that the para-ferroelectric transition is diffusive character and the diffuse exponent is 1.62. Selected area electron diffraction pattern of PFN showed that the occupations of Fe3+ and Nb5+ ions in B site are disordered, leading to the diffuse characters of the para-ferroelectric transition.",

The crystallinity, phase formation, morphology, and surface microstructure of the BMN nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), respectively. The phase evolution of the BMN nanoparticles investigated by XRD patterns showed that uniform cubic pyrochlore BMN nanoparticles were obtained after calcination at temperature of 800 C, and their structural information was revealed by Raman spectrum. TEM images demonstrated that the BMN nanoparticles had a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 70 nm, and their crystalline nature was revealed by HRTEM images. In addition, HRTEM images also demonstrate a terrace-ledge-kink (TLK) surface structure at the edges of rough BMN nanoparticles, where the terrace was on the (100) plane, and the ledge on the (001) plane. The formation of such a TLK surface structure can be well explained by a theory of periodic bond chains. Due to the surface structural reconstruction in the BMN nanoparticles, the formation of a tetragonal structure in a rough BMN nanoparticle was also revealed by HRTEM image. The BMN nanoparticles exhibited dielectric constants of 50 at 100 kHz and 30 at 1 MHz, and the dielectric loss of 0.19 at 1 MHz. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

The PX-phase PT nanowires exhibit acicular morphology with diameter sizes of 20-80 nm and length over one micrometer. They tend to grow into a regular structure with parallel arrangement along their long axis in the [001] direction. Selected area electron diffraction pattern taken from [110] demonstrates that the PX-phase PT crystal has a 3-fold modulated periodicity in the [110] direction, and 4-fold modulated periodicity in the [001] direction.

A low electric field was in situ applied during the film crystallization. It was first found that a low electric field and its direction have significant influence on the microstructures and ferroelectric properties of SBT films. Under a positive electric field (assuming that the bottom electrode is electrically grounded), the films show stronger c -axis-preferred orientation than without electric field and under a negative electric field. As a possible origin is proposed that the interface-induced nucleation growth between SBT and Pt coated substrate with application of low electric field plays a key role.

Nanorods 1 Introduction Monoclinic gallium oxide (\u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 ) is an important semiconducting material with various applications as a transparent conducting oxide, optical emitter for UV, and as gas sensors [1\u20137] . Recently the synthesis of \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanostructures such as nanowires, nanobelts and nanosheets has been reported. Many high-temperature methods, such as arc-discharge, carbon thermal reduction, vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid method, thermal oxidation and laser ablation have been developed for the synthesis of \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 with the above different morphologies [8\u201314] . Little effort has been devoted to synthesizing Ga 2 O 3 nanostructures based on aqueous solution systems. Sonochemical hydrolysis of Ga 3+ ions has been used to prepare scroll-like cylindrical nanoparticles of gallium oxide hydrate (GaOOH) [15] . Yeh's group has prepared spindle-like GaOOH nanoparticles in cetyltrimethyl- ammonium bromide water solution by laser ablation [16] . However, they have not reported on how GaOOH transform to \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 . Through hydrolyzing Ga 3+ at 95 \u00b0C in aqueous solutions, Tel et al. [17] have produced GaOOH quadrilateral prisms and spindle-like nanoparticles without and with urea in solution. After calcination at high temperature, the spindles lose their morphology, and the quadrilateral prisms maintain their morphology, but with some nanoscale holes. In this paper, we report on a hydrothermal synthesis of GaOOH crystals whose morphologies can be modulated from quadrilateral prisms to spindle-like nanorod arrays by changing synthetic conditions. The final \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 products with morphology similar to their precursors (GaOOH) have been obtained by heat treatment. The photoluminescence properties of the \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanorods have been investigated as well. 2 Experimental procedure In a typical synthesis, commercial Ga 2 O 3 (99.99%) was dissolved into diluted hydrochloric acid to form a solution. After evaporation, 35 ml of deionized water or the mixed solvent of diethyleneglycol (DEG) and water (DEG:H 2 O=1:1 vol) was added to form a clear solution. Then 1 mol l \u22121 of sodium hydroxide solution (analytical reagent, A.R.) was introduced dropwise to the stirred solution till pH=6\u20138. The as-obtained colloidal precipitate was transferred to a 50 ml autoclave, sealed and heated at 180 \u00b0C for 24 h. Then the autoclave was cooled to room temperature with an average cooling rate of about 1K min \u22121 . The hydrothermal crystals were recovered by filtration, washing and drying at 60 \u00b0C in air for 6 h. The as-formed hydrothermal crystals were annealed at 900 \u00b0C in air to form the final products. The phase purity and crystallinity of the samples were examined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on a Rigaku-Dmax 2500 diffractometer with Cu k\u03b1 radiation ( \u03bb = 0.154 nm ). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, XL 30 Philips) was used to examine the morphology of the samples. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp as the excitation source. The luminescence decay curves were obtained using a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 Digital Oscilloscope (1 GHz) and a 254 nm UV laser (pulse width=4 ns) as the excitation source (Continuum Sunlite OPO). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Phase formation and morphology The as-formed hydrothermal products were pure GaOOH crystals with orthorhombic structure (JCPDS 06-0180), as evidenced by the XRD patterns presented in Figs. 1a and 1b ). After a subsequent heat treatment at 900 \u00b0C in air, the GaOOH crystals have transformed to pure monoclinic \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 crystals (JCPDS card 43-1012), as indicated in Figs. 1c and d [18] . Fig. 2 exhibits typical FE-SEM images of gallium oxide hydrate (GaOOH) samples. As shown in Fig. 2 , samples synthesized at pH=6 are regular quadrilateral nanorods with widths ranging from 200 to 300 nm. However, the mean aspect ratio of samples derived from DEG:H 2 O mixed solvents is 1:15 ( Figs. 2a and b ), while that of those from water systems is 1:7 ( Figs. 2c and d ). The samples prepared from pH=8 in water ( Figs. 2e and f ) are uniform spindle-like nanorod arrays with an aspect ratio of 1:3, which are composed of parallel nanorods of about 100 nm in diameter. After calcination, the obtained \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 crystals retain their morphology. Fig. 2 (g, h) displays the FESEM images of the above two series of \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 samples. Clearly, these \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 samples consist of nanorods and nanorod arrays, respectively. There is no obvious change related to the size of the crystals. The insets in Figs. 2g and h illustrate their cross sections. For the quadrilateral nanorod series, the cross sections change from the quadrilateral shape to diamond-like patterns ( Fig. 2(g) . This is probably because the orthorhombic phase GaOOH transforms to monoclinic \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 . The growth process of GaOOH nanorods under hydrothermal conditions has been studied by examining their morphologies at different growing stages in autoclaves. Fig. 3 presents the XRD patterns of samples obtained at pH=6 for different hydrothermal treatment time and the untreated blank sample ( Fig. 3d ). The samples which have been hydrothermally treated for 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 h are denoted as GaOOH-1 ( Fig. 3a ), GaOOH-2 ( Fig. 3b ) and GaOOH-3 ( Fig. 3c ), respectively. It can be seen from the XRD analysis that no matter whether the colloidal precipitate has been treated hydrothermally or not and regardless of how long it has stayed in an autoclave, all of the products are well crystallized GaOOH phases, except for very few impurities existing in the blank sample, as denoted with an asterisk in Fig. 3(d) . In our case, the gallium trichloride (GaCl 3 ) water solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide solution, then the obtained colloidal precipitate in the range of pH=6\u20138 was GaOOH instead of Ga(OH) 3 . When pH\u2a7d4 and pH\u2a7e9, clear solutions formed instead. At the starting titration stage (pH\u2a7d4) of the GaCl 3 \u2013H 2 O\u2013NaOH system, gallium probably existed in the form of soluble basic salts, like Ga(OH)Cl 2 and Ga(OH) 2 Cl. In the range of pH=6\u20138, a GaOOH precipitate appeared and the system became turbid. This is consistent with the experimental results of Roy et al. [18] . If the pH value is continuously increased to 9, the gallium element begins to convert to a gallium acid radical because GaOOH is an amphoteric compound. The clear GaCl 3 \u2013H 2 O\u2013NaOH solution of pH=9 was hydrothermally treated, but no solid products could be recovered. When the colloidal precipitate was treated under hydrothermal conditions, GaOOH was the stable phase between 110 and 300 \u00b0C [19] . The above evidence suggests that no phase transformation occurs during the growing process of GaOOH quadrilateral prisms. But it is apparent that the intensity ratios of some crystal planes are different. The (1 1 0) and (1 3 0) crystal planes lie parallel to the c-axis, while (0 0 2) is perpendicular to the c -axis and (1 1 1) intersects the c -axis at a 45\u00b0 angle. These crystal planes\u2019 peak intensity values have been calculated to deduce the preferential growth direction of GaOOH crystals. The calculated results are listed in Table 1 . It can be concluded that the intensity ratios of crystal planes (1 1 0) and (1 3 0) to (1 1 1) and (0 0 2) increases with prolonging the hydrothermal treatment time. The intensity ratios of GaOOH-3 and GaOOH (24 h) are also bigger than that of GaOOH (JCPDS 06-0180). It is proposed that the c -axis is both the preferential growth direction and the longitudinal direction of GaOOH quadrilateral nanorods. This result is in agreement with Aldinger group's report and analogous to the case of FeOOH with the same diaspore structure [17,20] . The entire growth process of GaOOH crystals from the colloidal precipitate to quadrilateral nanorods has been also recorded in Fig. 4 by monitoring their shape transformation at different growing stages. The primary particles of GaOOH-1 are spherical nanoparticles of about 50 nm in diameter ( Fig. 4a ). Then the crystal nucleus began to starts growing along the c -axis. Crystal nuclei may be the primary nanoparticles themselves. From Fig. 4(b) it is evident that rod-like crystals form in the particle aggregates. Sample GaOOH-2 is just the mixture of rod-like crystals and particle aggregates. During the continuous growth of GaOOH-3, the rough rod-like crystals have become bigger, and the nanoparticles have been gradually consumed as shown in Fig. 4(c) . The uniform quadrilateral nanorods with smooth surfaces finally grow up and separate from each other ( Fig. 4d ). GaOOH crystals belong to the orthorhombic crystal system. In this work, the crystals grew preferentially along the c -axis, that is why these GaOOH crystals finally formed prisms with quadrilateral cross-sections. The existence of DEG presumably hinders the growth of GaOOH crystals along the direction perpendicular to the c -axis, so longer nanorods are formed as compared with those of the pure water system. The initial pH conditions of these colloidal precipitates have resulted in different shapes from quadrilateral nanorods to nanorod arrays. This can be ascribed to the fact that under higher pH value (pH=8) the nucleating process occurs faster and more crystal nuclei form. These crystal nuclei in the particle aggregates grow along the same direction simultaneously to form nanorod arrays. Before these nanorods continue to grow enough to become nanorods which can separate from each other, the primary nanoparticles are consumed completely, so that the growing process stops and the nanorod arrays remain. For the samples of lower pH value (pH=6), the crystal nuclei formed can grow big enough to form quadrilateral nanorods. 3.2 Luminescence properties Under short UV excitation, the as-formed GaOOH nanorods do not exhibit any luminescence, but the annealed samples (\u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanorods) show a strong blue emission. Fig. 5(a) shows the photoluminescence spectrum of the \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanorods under excitation at 254 nm at room temperature. A broad emission band ranging from 300 to 600 nm with a maximum at 455 nm and a shoulder at 325 nm is observed. This is similar to that of \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanobelts [21] . The luminescence decay curve for the main emission (455 nm) is shown in Fig. 5(b) . This decay curve cannot be well fitted into a singly exponential function, but can be well fitted by a biexponential function as I ( t ) = A 1 exp ( - t / \u03c4 1 ) + A 2 exp ( - t / \u03c4 2 ) , where \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 are the fast and slow lifetimes of the luminescence, and A 1 and A 2 are the fitting parameters, respectively. The fitting results related to Fig. 5(b) are A 1 = 7.08 , \u03c4 1 = 13.54 ns , A 2 = 2.14 , \u03c4 2 = 89.63 ns . The average lifetime, defined as < \u03c4 > = ( A 1 \u03c4 1 2 + A 2 \u03c4 2 2 ) / ( A 1 \u03c4 1 + A 2 \u03c4 2 ) , is determined as 64 ns [22] . The double decay behavior for the luminescence of \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanorods indicates a complicated luminescent process in this semiconductor, i.e. there exist different emission centers and energy migration processes, which occur among them after excitation. The energy migration can occur either by diffusion of free holes or by diffusion of self-trapped holes [23] . Fig. 5(c) illustrates the blue emission process in \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 . Briefly, the blue emission can be attributed to the recombination of an electron on a donor formed by oxygen vacancies with a hole on an acceptor formed by either gallium vacancies or gallium-oxygen vacancy pairs [24] . Under the excitation of 254 nm irradiation (band gap excitation), an electron (\u25cf) is excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). The electron (\u25cf) moves freely in the CB and finally relaxes to the donor band (oxygen vacancies). The recombination of the electron in the donor band with the acceptor (gallium vacancies or gallium\u2013oxygen vacancy pairs) yields the blue emission with a maximum wavelength at 455 nm. Indeed, because the \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanorods are fabricated from GaOOH precursors at high temperature, the loss of OH ions can result in a number of O vacancies and Ga\u2013O vacancy pairs. 4 Conclusions In summary, the GaCl 3 \u2013H 2 O\u2013NaOH system with different pH values, from 6 to 8, have been hydrothermally treated in water or a DEG:H 2 O mixed solvent. GaOOH quadrilateral nanorods have been retrieved at pH=6, while nanorod arrays have been obtained at pH=8. The aspect ratio can be modulated from 1:7 in water to 1:15 in DEG:H 2 O. The formation mechanism is that the nanoparticle nuclei grow preferentially along the c -axis to become nanorods finally. Higher pH values (pH=8) yield higher nucleating rates, further resulting in the formation of nanorod arrays. GaOOH crystals can be transformed to gallium oxide (\u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 ) crystals with a similar morphology. This suggests that the combination of hydrothermal processes and subsequent heat treatments is a method to prepare nanorods of \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 . The \u03b2-Ga 2 O 3 nanorods show a blue emission under the 254 nm excitation with a maximum of 455 nm and an average lifetime of 64 ns.

Firstly, the brown SnO particles were obtained by grinding mixed SnCl 2 \u00b72H 2 O and KOH powders at room temperature. Then, the powders were calcined in air (thermal oxidation) to form the SnO 2 nanoparticles. The phase compositions and microstructures of the product were examined by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), respectively. Furthermore, we have measured the gas-sensing property of the products and found its distinct selectivity towards ethanol at the presence of gasoline and acetylene, which is different from the property of pure SnO 2 nanoparticles. The mechanism of such a specificity was discussed briefly.",

On this principle, we have fabricated multilayered films [ZnO/Al2O3]n by pulsed-laser deposition technique, with period of 2.0 to 400 nm and total period number of 4 to 30. The completely (001) textured ZnO layers generated single piezoelectric coefficient d33, and the amorphous Al2O3 layers did not. The film microstructures and orientations were analyzed by low and high angle X-ray diffraction \u03b8 - 2\u03b8 scans. High frequency resonance of 10.6 GHz was measured and higher values up to 100 GHz are expected. The results provided possible way to monolithically integrate acoustic resonator and transducer in silicon devices.",

Raman and infrared spectroscopy studies show a remarkable broadening of the reflection peaks with decreasing grain size, identifying the significant surface structure relaxation effect for small-size powders. The ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition around 65-68\u00b0C is determined by the specific-heat measurement, also indicating the remarkable size dependence.",

The hysteresis area A as a function of frequency f of the external field E is single-peaked, due to the full spin relaxation at low f and suppressing effect at high f for the domain switching. It is revealed from the simulation that the hysteresis area A can be scaled with a dynamic scaling function A(f)/Am = F(x), which is symmetric to x = 0, where x = log(f/fm) with f = fm the position of the peak Am = A(fm). The scaling gets support from the experiment and is consistent with the prediction of the (\u03a62)2-model.",

Although the hysteresis loops of these films had an unacceptable degradation under such a H2-containing reducing atmosphere, no obvious polarization fatigue with electric field cycling could be observed. However, an increase of P* r was observed over the initial period of the fatigue test. It could be viewed as a competition between the increase of P*r due to the leakage current and the decrease of P*r due to switching polarization. H2 played an important role in the increasing in the leakage current of SBT thin films, forming more weak pinning centers of domain walls, and degradation in the fatigue characteristics. \u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

The x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy measurements show that the films have a single phase and are well crystallized and homogeneous. Dielectric properties are investigated as function of temperature and frequency. It is found that the Ti substitution increases the dielectric constant. At 10 kHz, the room temperature dielectric constant and loss tangent (\u03b5, tan \u03b4) are (163, 0.006), (182, 0.014), (197, 0.010) for the films with x=0, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively. In a wide temperature and frequency range (-100 \u00b0C\u223c50 \u00b0C, 1 kHz\u223c1 MHz), the dielectric constant is almost constant. However, below -100 \u00b0C, a dielectric relaxation depending on Ti content is observed. The relationship between structure and property of this thin film system is discussed. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics.",

X-ray diffraction characteristics show that the films on STO exhibit highly (0 0 1) oriented structure and the films on Pt/Si have polycrystalline structure. Dielectric properties of PSZT films aimed at electrically tunable applications were investigated as a function of temperature and electric field. The films on STO show higher Curie temperature, larger dielectric constant and higher tunability, due to a highly c-axis orientation and larger grain size. Both the PSZT films on STO or Pt/Si substrates show a weakly temperature-dependent tunability in the temperature range from 25 to 150 \u00b0C, implying favourable temperature stability for practical application. These results suggest that the PSZT60 film may be a potential candidate material for further investigation of electrically tunable applications. \u00a9 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). No peaks of SrTiO3 (STO) could be detected in the XRD pattern, indicating the existence of the SBTi single phase. Good ferroelectric hysteresis loops of the films with Pt electrodes were obtained. With an applied field of 400 kV/cm, the measured remanent polarization (Pr) and coercive field (Ec) values were 4.1 \u03bcC/cm2 and 75 kV/cm respectively. The films showed little fatigue after 2.22 \u00d7 109 switching cycles: the nonvolatile polarizations decreased by less than 5% of the initial values. The dielectric constant and the loss tangent of the films were measured to be 363 and 0.04 at 100 kHz. These results might be advantageous for nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (NVFRAM) and dynamic random access memory (DRAM).",

The formation and the evolution of the surface patterns can be interpreted as Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the melted silicon layer under the interfacial pressure formed by fast boiling of the interfacial water at the laser-heated silicon surface. Based on the mechanism, a liquid film equation was proposed. The time evolution of the patterns was then compared with that of the well-defined classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability system. It showed that the two systems were qualitatively consistent in several aspects, supporting the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mechanism proposed. \u00a9 2008 Springer-Verlag.",

        "abstract": "Ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films sandwiched by YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) electrodes on (0 0 1) SrTiO3 wafers are prepared by pulsed laser deposition. The dynamic hysteresis response of the films to the periodic time-varying electrical field E(t) of different amplitude E0 (0-45kVcm-1) and frequency f (f = 10-2 to 10 5Hz) is measured. We study in detail the evolution and stability of the hysteresis pattern. A stability diagram for the dynamic hysteresis of PZT films is developed and an empirical scaling relationship covering the whole frequency range is proposed. Finally, we develop a Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm based on the planar X-Y model to simulate the dynamic hysteresis in multi-domain spin systems and a qualitative consistency between the simulated dynamic behaviors and measured ones is established. \u00a9 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The resonant elastic scattering 16 O( \u03b1 , \u03b1 ) 16 O at near 3.045 MeV is a very powerful tool for determining the oxygen concentration in oxide films. The resonance yield can be transformed into the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen to Ba\u2013Ti as a function of the probed depth. By means of the resonance yield, we can obtain the oxygen concentration in BaTiO 3 films. In this work the method was used to analyze the oxygen concentration of the BaTiO 3 films deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at different oxygen ambience. Our experimental results demonstrate that the oxygen concentration in the films deposited by PLD is homogeneous, and the effect of oxygen pressure in the process of deposition on the oxygen concentration in the films is very significant. It is shown in our experiment that 20 Pa is the lowest value of oxygen pressure for forming optimum BaTiO 3 films by the PLD method.",

X-ray \ufffd\ufffd-2\ufffd\ufffd scans revealed that the films as-grown at a substrate temperature of 750-850\ufffd\ufffdC were single phase defective perovskite, and exhibited superstructure line in addition to the lines expected for the foundamenal perovskite structure. The films can be produced by escaping of potassium from K2La2Ti3O10 and the superstructure line observed was considered to arise from the ordered arrangement of the A-site vacancies. The chemical compositions of the films were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Optical waveguiding properties were demonstrated by m-line measurement using a rutile prism coupling method. The as grown films are colorless and transparent, and have the effective refractive index of 1.917 for TE modes at 632.8 nm. ? 1996 American Institute of Physics.",

Both samples have maximum polarizations of >21 \u03bcC/cm 2 and piezoelectric d 33 values of \u223c37 pC/N at room temperature. Their polarized slices show the dielectric anomalies and impedance anomalies because of vibrating resonances below 500\u00b0C, and the thickness vibration electromechanical coupling factor is \u223c0.6 and \u223c0.4 for BiFeO 3 and Bi 0.92Dy 0.08FeO 3, respectively.

BTN films on Ti/SiO2/Si substrates were grown at a relatively low temperature (650 \u00b0C) with a biased electrical field during pulsed-laser deposition. The (001) orientation of the films, which makes no contribution to their polarization, was effectively reduced by the in situ electrical field of strength of 70 V/cm. This results in a large increase of remnant polarization from 1.1 to 6.2 \u03bcC/cm2, and reduction of the coercive field from 70 to 50 kV/cm, comparing the films grown freely under the same condition. Furthermore, the films showed an excellent fatigue-free property of up to 1010 switching cycles. \u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics.",

        "abstract": "Compositionally-graded (Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x )TiO 3 thin films ( x varying from 0 to 0.25) were epitaxially grown by pulsed-laser deposition on (1 0 0)MgO single-crystal substrates with a conductive La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 layer as bottom electrode. The crystallinity and epitaxial growth behavior of the graded BST films were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the graded films are (1 0 0)-oriented with an orientation relationship of (1 0 0)[0 1 0] BST //(1 0 0)[0 1 0] MgO . Cross-sectional TEM images show that graded BST films grow with a columnar structure and a surface roughness of 10 nm. From planar TEM images granular and/or polyhedral shaped grains are observed with an average grain size of 65 nm. At room temperature, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss at 10 kHz for the graded film were 953 and 0.0103, respectively. A broad and flat profile of the dielectric constant versus temperature was demonstrated in the graded film. This was attributed to the presence of the compositional and/or residual strain gradients in the epitaxial compositionally-graded films. With such a graded structure, it is possible to build dielectric thin film capacitors with almost negligible temperature dependence of the capacitance, thereby operating without the need for controlling the environmental temperatures. Keywords Compositionally-graded films (Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x )TiO 3 Microstructure Dielectric property 1 Introduction Recently strong interest has focused on the development of tunable dielectric materials for frequency agile rf and microwave devices, such as tunable filters, voltage controlled oscillators, varactors, delay lines, and phase shifters [1\u20133] . Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x TiO 3 (BST) thin films are considered as one of the forerunner material systems for realization of such tunable components due to their high dielectric constant and dielectric tunability, reasonably low dielectric loss, and controllable Curie temperature by adjusting the barium-to-strontium ratio [4\u20136] . The required properties for ideal microwave ferroelectric materials are high tunability ( \u0394 \u03b5 r / \u03b5 r , where \u03b5 r is the dielectric constant), high quality factor Q (low loss tangent tan \u03b4 ), low temperature coefficient of dielectric constant (TC \u025b ), and reasonable \u025b r [7,8] . Recently many attempts have been made to increase the tunability and decrease the dielectric loss of BST films by controlling the film texture [9,10] , improving the interfacial quality between the film and electrode [11] , altering the film stress [12] , and modifying the microstructures of the films [13,14] , whereas less efforts have been made to improve the temperature stability. A practical concern in a tunable microwave resonator is that its resonant frequency changes with the temperature because it strongly depends upon the dielectric constant of the BST film, which is highly temperature-dependent for a fixed composition. To improve the temperature stability of the dielectric constant, and simultaneously enhance the dielectric tunability and lower the dielectric loss, a promising approach is to prepare compositionally-graded BST films by depositing successive layers with different Ba/Sr ratios. In these layers, multiphase compositions with different phase transition temperatures are formed, but a high dielectric constant and a relatively small TC \u025b value are maintained, making such graded materials highly preferable in applications where the capacitance of a device should be only weakly dependent on temperature. Since high angle grain boundaries increase the dielectric loss and consequently limit the performance of the device, for microwave dielectric applications, grain-oriented and/or epitaxial films are highly required because of their high dielectric constant and large tunability [3] . Recently epitaxial BST films with compositionally-graded structure and highly-oriented graded Pb(Zr, Ti)O 3 thin films have been prepared by pulsed-laser deposition [15\u201318] , but their microstructure has not yet been studied in detail. In this work, we report on the microstructure and dielectric properties of compositionally-graded epitaxial BST films, which were deposited on (1 0 0)MgO single-crystal substrates with conductive La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 (LSCO) as a bottom electrode by pulsed-laser deposition. The microstructure of epitaxially-graded BST films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies from both plan-view and cross-sectional specimens. The relationship between the dielectric properties and the microstructure revealed by TEM is discussed. 2 Experimental procedure Compositionally-graded (Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x )TiO 3 thin films with x varying from 0.0 at the bottom to 0.25 at the top were epitaxially grown on (1 0 0)MgO single-crystal substrates with conductive LSCO layer as a bottom electrode, at 650 \u00b0C in an oxygen ambient pressure of 26.6 Pa, by pulsed-laser deposition. Details of the deposition procedure were described elsewhere [15] . To characterize the dielectric properties of the graded BST films, an LSCO bottom electrode was first deposited on the (1 0 0)MgO substrate at 600 \u00b0C and an oxygen pressure of 20 Pa. The graded films were in situ deposited epitaxially on the top surface of the LSCO layer, followed by Au/Cr sputtering on the top surface of the graded films. The thickness of the LSCO bottom electrode and the graded BST films were about 180 and 300 nm, respectively, measured by cross-sectional TEM images. The diameter of the top circular Au/Cr electrodes was 200 \u03bcm. The capacitance and dielectric dissipation factor, in the 10 2 to 10 6 Hz frequency range, were measured by Hewlett-Packard 4194A impedance analyzer with ac oscillation level of 100 mV. Temperature dependent dielectric properties were measured by a temperature-controlled box with temperature ranging from \u221220 to 150 \u00b0C. The maximum rate of heating and cooling for the samples was less than 1 K/min. The compositional gradients were determined by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS, not shown here). The microstructure of the compositionally-graded BST films was characterized by X-ray diffraction patterns, rocking curves, and \u03d5 scans (XRD, Philips X\u2019Pert X-ray diffractometer, Cu K\u03b1 radiation at 30 kV), and TEM. Both cross-sectional and plan-view specimens were used for microstructural investigation. Cross-sectional specimens were prepared by cutting the sample into slices along the (0 0 1)MgO and (0 1 1)MgO planes. Two slices were glued together face-to-face joining the film-covered surface. After the glue cured, disks with a diameter of 3 mm were obtained by cutting away redundant epoxy. These disks were then ground, dimpled, and polished, followed by Ar-ion milling in a Gatan Precision Ion Polishing System (PIPS, Model 691) at 4 keV with an incident angle of 6\u00b0. Plan-view samples were prepared by cutting disks with a diameter of 3 mm from the graded film using an ultrasonic cutter. Then these disks were ground, dimpled, and finally thinned to perforation by Gatan dual ion-milling (Model 600) from the substrate side. Electron diffraction patterns and TEM images were recorded in a Philips CM20T electron microscope operated at 200 kV. 3 Results and discussion Crystallographic indexing in this work is based on the following unit cell parameters: the nominal lattice parameters are a MgO = 0.4213 nm; a LSCO = 0.381 nm; a BaTi o 3 = 0.3992 nm; C BaTi o 3 = 0.4036 nm; a BST = 0.3977 nm (BST, x = 0.23); C BST = 0.3988 nm (BST, x = 0.23) (for the latter two values, see the JCPDS card No. 44-0093). To characterize the crystallinity and epitaxial behavior of the compositionally-graded BST films, X-ray diffraction \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 scans, rocking curves, and \u03d5 scan studies were carried out. Fig. 1 a and b shows specular and off-specular XRD scans of the graded BST films deposited on (1 0 0)MgO substrate with LSCO as a bottom electrode. It is clearly observed in Fig. 1 a that prominent BST (1 0 0) and (2 0 0) diffraction peaks appeared together with (1 0 0) and (2 0 0) peaks of LSCO and the (2 0 0)MgO peak. This evidences the formation of a (1 0 0)-oriented BST graded film on the (1 0 0)MgO substrate covered with (1 0 0)-oriented LSCO bottom electrode. The inset in Fig. 1 a shows the (2 0 0) rocking curves of BST, LSCO and MgO, respectively. The graded BST film exhibits good crystallinity with a FWHM (full width at half maximum) value of 0.775\u00b0. As shown in Fig. 1 b, the presence of BST (1 1 0) and (2 2 0) reflections oriented with respect to the (2 2 0) reflection of MgO displays the single-crystal nature of the grown film and reveals the in-plane epitaxial relationship between the graded BST film and the MgO substrate: (1 0 0)[0 1 0] BST //(1 0 0)[0 1 0] MgO . Fig. 1 c shows the XRD 360\u00b0 \u03d5 scan on the (2 2 0) reflections of BST, LSCO and MgO, respectively. These reflections clearly demonstrate a good epitaxial growth of the graded BST film and the LSCO bottom electrode on the (1 0 0)MgO substrate. Both the BST film and the LSCO bottom electrode show a four-fold symmetry, indicating a cube-on-cube epitaxial growth of the graded BST film and LSCO layer on the MgO substrate. To better understand the graded epitaxial film quality, cross-sectional TEM studies were employed. Fig. 2 a and b are bright-field images taken from cross-sectional samples cut along the planes of (0 0 1)MgO and (0 1 1)MgO, respectively. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns taken from the area covering both the graded film, LSCO bottom electrode layer, and the substrate are shown in Fig. 2 c and d, respectively. From these TEM images it is observed that the graded BST film and the LSCO bottom electrode layer have sharp interfaces and good epitaxial orientation. They grow with a columnar-like structure, and the surface morphology of the graded BST film seems to involve some roughness in the order of 10 nm. The thickness of the graded BST film was measured to be 300 nm, and that of the bottom LSCO electrode layer was 180 nm. As shown in Fig. 2 c and d, the SAED patterns are a simple superposition of the graded BST film, LSCO bottom electrode, and the MgO substrate, respectively. The sharp electron diffraction spots with no features of satellites or broadening again indicate that the graded films have a good single-crystal quality. Based on the SAED patterns the epitaxial orientation relationship has been found to be (1 0 0) BST //(1 0 0) MgO and \u30080 0 1\u3009 BST //\u30080 0 1\u3009 MgO , which agrees well with the XRD result. From the highly ordered electron diffraction spots, the lattice parameters for BST and LSCO can be estimated to be 0.39903 and 0.3829 nm, respectively, which is consistent with the XRD results. A similar result was reported for an LSCO film deposited on (1 0 0)MgO by PLD with a lattice constant of 0.382 nm [19] . A bright-field, planar TEM image of the graded BST film, taken along the [1 0 0] direction of the BST film, is shown in Fig. 3 . The grains of the graded film have granular and/or polyhedral shapes with an average grain size of 65 nm. Dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the graded BST films as functions of the frequency are shown in Fig. 4 . The dielectric constant of the graded film decreases quickly at frequencies below 10 4 Hz. This can be ascribed to the effects of space charge polarization, which is inherently related to the non-uniform charge accumulation and the multi-interfaces within the graded films, and originates from the in situ annealing treatment in an oxygen atmosphere. In the high frequency region beyond 10 4 Hz, the dielectric constant is almost constant as the frequency is increased, and the dielectric loss (tan \u03b4 ) increases up to about 0.03 at a frequency of 10 6 Hz. At room temperature, the dielectric constant at 10 4 Hz for the graded films was 953, and the dielectric loss was 0.0103. The temperature dependence of the dielectric properties for the graded BST films is shown in Fig. 5 . A broad transition peak at about 90 \u00b0C was observed, which corresponds to the tetragonal\u2013cubic phase transition. Such broad and flat peak is typical of diffuse transitions as observed in some polycrystalline (Ba, Sr)TiO 3 and BaTiO 3 thin films [20,21] . In the present epitaxially-graded BST films, the lattice parameters and compositions change gradually along the thickness direction. The feature of the flat profile of the dielectric constant versus temperature for the graded BST thin films can be explained by the presence of the compositional and/or residual strain gradients in the epitaxial film as a result of the partial coherence of the film with the substrate [22] . In Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x TiO 3 the Curie temperature T c can be controlled by varying the mole fraction x of Sr. The T c of the material varies almost linearly from about 400 K for BaTiO 3 ( x = 0) to 30 K for SrTiO 3 ( x = 1.0) [23] . The compositional gradients determined by RBS in the present graded BST films (not shown here) almost correspond to a linear in-depth gradient. Therefore, the composition-dependent Curie temperature of the graded BST film should also exhibit a linear gradient in the thickness direction. This results in a distribution of dielectric relaxation times and Curie\u2013von Schweidler relaxation. The local variation of the composition and/or the lattice mismatch strain leads to local changes in the permittivity, which broadens the peak in the dielectric constant as a function of temperature. The inset in Fig. 5 is the corresponding relative change of the dielectric constant with temperature. It can be seen that the relative change of the dielectric constant is below 10% in the temperature range from 20 to 150 \u00b0C. With such a graded structure, it is possible to build dielectric thin film capacitors with low temperature dependence of the capacitance over a broad temperature range. This is beneficial to the use of tunable microwave devices based on such graded BST films requiring a wide range of working temperatures, with no need for an environmental temperature control. 4 Conclusions Compositionally-graded (Ba 1\u2212 x Sr x )TiO 3 thin films ( x varying from 0 to 0.25) have been epitaxially grown on (1 0 0)MgO single-crystal substrates with conductive La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 as bottom electrode by pulsed-laser deposition. Microstructural studies by X-ray diffraction and TEM reveal that the graded BST films have good crystallinity and epitaxial orientation. The orientation relationship is (1 0 0) BST //(1 0 0) MgO and \u30080 0 1\u3009 BST //\u30080 0 1\u3009 MgO . Cross-sectional TEM images show that the graded BST films grew with a columnar-like structure and have a surface roughness of 10 nm. Planar TEM images demonstrate that the grains have granular and/or polyhedral shapes with an average grain size of 65 nm. At room temperature the dielectric constant and dielectric loss at 10 kHz were 953 and 0.0103, respectively. The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant measured at 10 kHz demonstrated a broad and flat profile. This is attributed to the presence of compositional and/or residual strain gradients along the thickness direction. The improved temperature stability in this compositionally-graded structure is beneficial to the use of dielectric thin film capacitors based on this graded structure, when a wide range of operating temperatures is required.

        "title": "Unipolar resistive switching characteristics in Co3O4 films",
        "abstract": "Unipolar resistive switching behavior has been investigated in Pt/Co 3 O 4 /Pt stacks. The resistance ratio of the high- and low- resistance states is over 5 \u00d7 10 3 . The \u201cON/OFF\u201d operation of the memory cells can be repeated more than 200 times at room temperature. The resistance of the two states can be kept for more than 16 h without showing degradation. The temperature dependence of the resistance shows a metallic behavior at the low-resistance state, but a semiconductor-behavior at the high-resistance state. The mechanism responsible for the observed unipolar resistive switching behavior has been discussed. Keywords Resistance random access memory Resistive switching Co 3 O 4 film Pulsed laser deposition Unipolar switching Switching mechanism 1 Introduction Resistance switching random access memory combines the advantages of Flash and dynamic random access memory while avoiding their drawbacks, and can be highly scalable [1\u20134] . Therefore, this new memory concept may constitute the basis for the future non-volatile memories. Based on whether the switching characteristic depends on the polarity of the applied voltage, resistive switching behaviors are generally classified as unipolar and bipolar switching [1] . The unipolar resistive switching, which exhibits a large resistance ratio between the high-resistance state (HRS) and the low-resistance state (LRS) and shows the potential of dramatically increasing memory density, is of particular interest [5] . A variety of metal oxides have been demonstrated to show resistive switching, such as TiO 2 [3,6] , NiO [7,8] , ZnO [9] , Cu 2 O [10] , and CoO [11] . Among the various models proposed for the switching mechanism, the formation and rupture of filamentary conducting paths well describes the unipolar switching behaviors in TiO 2 [6,12] . Recently, Kwon et al. confirmed that the conducting filaments in TiO 2 consist of conductive Ti n O 2n\u22121 (mostly n = 4 or 5) with a diameter of ~ 5\u201310 nm [13] . However, further experimental and theoretical investigations are required to understand the physical image of such phenomena. Up to now, experimental data related to the resistive switching behavior of Co 3 O 4 films is still not clear. Compared with more complex oxides such as Cr-doped SrTi(Zr)O 3 [14] and (Ba, Sr)(Ti, Zr)O 3 [15] , binary oxides show great advantages not only in their compatibility to the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology but also in their resistance against thermal or chemical damages [16] . In this paper, we report the resistive switching behavior of Co 3 O 4 films deposited by pulsed laser deposition. A possible model for the resistive switching mechanism is discussed. 2 Experimental details The dense cobalt oxide ceramic target used in our experiment was prepared by sintering a pallet at 1000 \u00b0C for 12 h, which was fabricated by a cold pressing Co 3 O 4 powder under a pressure of 12 MPa. A KrF excimer laser (248 nm wavelength) running at 5 Hz with an average energy density of about 2.0 J cm \u22122 was employed. The distance between the substrate and the target was fixed at 8 cm. The films were deposited on commercially available Pt/Ti/SiO 2 /Si (111) substrates at 660 \u00b0C in an oxygen ambient with a pressure of 20 Pa. After deposition, the Co 3 O 4 /Pt/Ti/SiO 2 /Si stacks were annealed at 660 \u00b0C in O 2 for 30 min. A conventional microprobe station with Pt needle contacts (~ 50-\u03bcm-diam) was used for the top electrical contact. The needle was mechanically set on the Co 3 O 4 film carefully so that the tip doesn't scratch or perforate the surface of the film, as described in ref. [17] . Bias polarity was defined with reference to the bottom Pt electrode. A Keithley 2400 source-measure unit was used to measure the electrical properties of the stacks, which were performed in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a \u03b8 \u20132 \u03b8 scan mode (Rigaku-D/Max-rA, using Cu K \u03b1 radiation at 40 KV) was used to study the structure of the films. The cross-sectional morphology of the Co 3 O 4 films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (LEO-1530vp, operating voltage 10 kV). 3 Results and discussion The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films are presented in Fig.\u00a01 . The peaks at 2 \u03b8 = 19.0 o , 38.5 o and 59.4 o are the diffraction peaks of the (111), (222), and (511) planes of Co 3 O 4 , respectively. No other Bragg diffraction peaks of the films could be observed, indicating a well-crystallized Co 3 O 4 phase. The Co 3 O 4 film with a columnar grain structure and a thickness of 420 nm is very uniform, and the Co 3 O 4 /Pt interface shows a sharp boundary, as seen in Fig.\u00a02 . The resistive switching behavior was independent of the polarity of the applied voltage. A typical current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) curve under a positive scanning cycle is shown in Fig.\u00a03 . The device was initially in the HRS and could be transferred to the LRS by applying a large \u201cforming\u201d voltage (~ 8.6 V). Meanwhile, a compliance-current (1.5 mA in our experiment) was set to protect the device from hard breakdown [3] . When the sequent voltage sweep was carried out on the device without the compliance-current, a sudden drop of current appeared at 0.52 V (RESET voltage). After that, the HRS was achieved. By applying a current-limited SET voltage (~ 1.9 V), the LRS could be obtained again. When the voltage was swept back, the curve went along the route C \u2192 D \u2192 A rather than C \u2192 B \u2192 A indicating that the LRS of the device can be retained. The above three stages are corresponding to the Forming, RESET, and SET processes, respectively. It should be pointed out that the voltage needed for the SET process is lower than that needed for the Forming process. Interestingly, the intermediate resistance state similar to those observed in TiO 2 [18] and NiO [8] was also observed occasionally in our experiment, as marked by the asterisk in Fig.\u00a03 . The resistance ratio of the high- and low-resistance states is over 5 \u00d7 10 3 . The switching process can be repeated more than 200 times at room temperature. The retention property of the Pt/Co 3 O 4 /Pt stacks at room temperature is shown in Fig.\u00a04 . In order not to affect the resistance state of the stacks, a small reading voltage of 10 mV was adopted. Both the HRS and LRS can be held for more than 16 h without degradation. Fig.\u00a05 shows the temperature dependence of the resistance in the HRS and LRS, respectively. The resistance of the LRS exhibits a metallic behavior, while that of the HRS exhibits a semiconductor-behavior. Based on the results of our experiment and some other literatures [13,19] , a model on the basis of filamentary conducting paths [18,19] for the unipolar resistive switching in Pt/Co 3 O 4 /Pt systems is proposed. The oxide films prepared by pulsed laser deposition contain a great deal of defects [20] . The defects in the Co 3 O 4 film include cobalt interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Both kinds of defects will reduce the band gap. Thus, the oxygen-deficient region in the Co 3 O 4 film is more conductive than the stoichiometric region. When oxygen vacancy density increases to a critical value, a large deviation in the composition from the stoichiometric Co 3 O 4 may cause the localized metallic behavior [21] , as shown by the temperature dependence of the resistance in the LRS in Fig.\u00a05 . In the Co 3 O 4 film, oxygen ions are much more mobile than the cobalt cations [19] . During the Forming process, the oxygen ions in the film will move towards the anode under the high electric field. At the points of the electrode interface where charge carriers inject, the oxygen-deficient regions appear and propagate toward the opposite electrode [22] . Once they reach the other electrode, the filaments are formed and the device is hence transferred to the LRS. Due to the negative free energy of forming lower valence-state oxide [19] , the incident Joule heat makes the new state stabilized and the filaments can be preserved. The current flow will strengthen the filament segment in the base region [23] , thus a tree-shaped filament is reasonably assumed [18] . In the RESET process, the weakest part (in the branch region) of the filament will be predominantly dissolved by absorbing oxygen ions nearby [13] , which is facilitated by the large heat generated by the large local current flow. Due to the compliance-current during the Forming process, only limited filaments are formed. The filament size is on the nanometer scale, which is much smaller than the tip radius of approximately 50 \u03bcm. So it is possible that several branches or several filaments contribute to the device resistance in the LRS collectively [13] . Because of their individual difference, they might not be ruptured simultaneously, which may result in the intermediate state during the reset process as marked in Fig.\u00a03 . From the data shown in Fig.\u00a03 , the current was 2.33 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mA under 0.1 V before the Forming process, while it was 8.65 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mA after the RESET process. Considering that the filaments were partly destroyed during the RESET process, the following SET process doesn't need a large voltage as that applied in the Forming process, which is consistent with our experiment result. 4 Conclusion In summary, the resistive switching characteristic in Co 3 O 4 films deposited by pulsed laser deposition was investigated. The Pt/Co 3 O 4 /Pt stacks exhibit typical unipolar switching behaviors. A preliminary model on the basis of formation and rupture of the conducting paths is proposed. The simple composition and good electrical properties make the Co 3 O 4 film as a promising material for the future non-volatile resistive switching devices.

They were characterized by using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that the Cu2S films deposited at room temperature are well crystallized and the grains are oriented along different directions. With the increase of the annealing temperature, the grains of Cu2S films prefer the <00l>-orientations, and the average size of Cu2S films decreases. After annealed at 400\u00b0C, the films are completely <00l>-oriented, and the grain boundaries of Cu2S films become undistinguishable due to the possible movements of the ions at high temperature. The resistive ratio of the 'off' state to the 'on' state is about 107 for the memory unit of Cu/Cu2S/Pt structure with the Cu2S films annealed at 400\u00b0C, about 6 orders of magnitude higher than that for the memory unit with the Cu2S films deposited at room temperature. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

Well-developed unipolar\nswitching behaviors in amorphous LaLuO3 make it suited for not only logic but\nmemory applications using the conventional semiconductor or the emerging\nnano/CMOS architectures. The conduction transition between high- and low-\nresistance states is attributed to the change in the separation between oxygen\nvacancy sites in the light of the correlated barrier hopping theory. The mean\nmigration distances of vacancies responsible for the resistive switching are\ndemonstrated in nanoscale, which could account for the ultrafast programming\nspeed of 6 ns. The origin of the distributions in switching parameters in\noxides can be well understood according to the switching principle.\nFurthermore, an approach has also been developed to make the operation voltages\npredictable for the practical applications of resistive memories.",

Two distinct types of interfaces are observed. One case is the presence of interfacial layer with distorted structure, whereas another case is the good interfacial match without any interfacial layer. Based on the analyses of crystallographic relationships between BST and Pt, it is proposed that the in-plane lattice structure plays an important role in determining the feature of the interface. The impact of A-O and B-O terminations of BST films on the interfacial layer is also discussed. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

The results from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic revealed that interface reactions take place after the NH3 and N2 annealing process, but, as compared with the N2 annealing process, the NH3 annealing process can effectively decrease the thickness of the interfacial layer and incorporate more nitrogen at the dielectric/SiGe interface, resulting in smaller equivalent oxide thickness. The La2O3 capacitors annealed in NH3 show good capacitance-voltage characteristics with negligible hysteresis, smaller interface trap density and lower gate-leakage current density in comparison with those of capacitors annealed in N2. It is demonstrated that the NH3 annealing process can be a promising technology in improving the quality of high-k dielectric on FD SGOI substrates. \u00a9 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "As potential gate dielectric materials, pseudobinary oxide (TiO 2)x(Al2O3)1-x (0.1\u2264x\u22640.6) films (TAO) were deposited on Si (100) substrates by pulsed-laser deposition method and studied systematically via various measurements. By a special deposition process, including two separate steps, the TAO films were deposited in the form of two layers. The first layer was deposited at room temperature and the second layer was completed at the substrate temperature of 400 \u00b0C. Detailed data show that the properties of the TAO films are closely related to the ratio between TiO2 and Al2O3. The existence of the first layer deposited at room temperature can effectively restrain the formation of the interfacial layer. And according to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy performed on the films, no other information belonging to the silicon oxide could be observed. For the (TiO2)0.4(Al2O3)0.6 film, the best result has been achieved among all samples and its dielectric constant is evaluated to be about 38. It is valuable for the amorphous TAO film as one of the promising dielectric materials for high-k gate dielectric applications. \u00a9 2007 Springer-Verlag.",

The Ti0.25 Al0.75 Ox films show electrical hysteresis in the C-V measurements after high-temperature treatment. The C-V curves shifting to positive flatband voltage indicate the existence of negative fixed charges in the films. By virtue of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, it is deduced that the films include several nanosized crystals regions, which are attributed to the hexagonal unreacted Al2 O3 and orthorhombic solid state reaction product Ti Al2 O5 after high-temperature treatment. While the annealing treatment is up to 900 \u00b0C, the preferable crystal direction is the direction perpendicular to the c axis in the orthorhombic Ti Al2 O5 lattice. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics.",

This compound is found with the zincblende structure at room temperature by using x-ray diffraction. Conductance-voltage characteristics reveal that a switching effect exists when the polarity of the voltage biased is changed. By applying a voltage of +0.5 V on the copper electrode, our device is switched on while -0.8 V induces the OFF-state. The switching operation could be repeated at least 103 times, and the GON/GOFF ratio is more than 3 \u00d7 103. It is expected to be a promising model of nonvolatile memories. With the TEM study, we have analysed the migration of Cu+, S2- and I - under an electric field and attribute the switching effect to the formation and annihilation of ionic conducting paths. \u00a9 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The first-principles calculation indicates that the oxygen vacancies in cubic Lu2O3 will form defective energy level below the bottom of conduction band, and reduce the band gap.

Their structures have been characterized by x-ray diffraction, and the surface and cross-section morphologies have been investigated by using scanning electron microscopy. It was found that larger energy density of the laser beam favoured the crystallization of RbAg4I5 particles and increased the resistance of the 'off' state, and lower energy density of the laser beam induces the appearance of the AgI phase in the films and reduces the resistance of the 'off' state. A narrow 'window' of the substrate temperature (around 80 \u00b0C) for the deposition of pure RbAg4I5 films has also been observed. The RbAg4I5 film deposited on Pt/TiO 2/SiO2/Si(1 1 1) substrates at 80 \u00b0C shows a uniform and flat surface. All the RbAg4I5 memory devices show obvious resistive switching behaviour. \u00a9 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

XRD and SEM results show that SBT powders still remain polycrystalline perovskite structure and amounts of Bi and \u03b4-Bi2O3 are reduced from SBT annealed in the forming gas at 400\u2103. Spherical and needle structures form on the surface of SBT thin films annealed in the forming gas at 500\u2103. Bi element in powders is more easily reduced at lower temperature compared with that of thin films and form needle structures on SBT surface. Bi deficiency derived from forming gas annealing causes serious ferroelectricity degradation on the SBT capacitors. Annealed in the forming gas ambient at 400\u2103 for 5.5min,the remnant polarization of SBT films drop about 43%. If annealing time is longer than 8.5min,films are breakdown and ferroelectricity disappears totally. However,no obvious polarization fatigue with 109 electric field cycling could be observed.",

The dielectric and ferroelectric properties,and microstructure of the BaTiO3 nanofilms were characterized. The results showed that the dielectric constant of the BaTiO3 nanofilms with a thickness of 170 nm,decreased slowly from 400 to 350 as the measured frequency was increased from 103 Hz to 106 Hz,and that the dielectric loss increased slowly from 0.029 to 0.036 in the low frequency range from 103 Hz to 105 Hz,whereas quickly increased up to 0.07 at high frequencies over 105 Hz. Such a phenomenon was resulted from the dielectric dipolar polarization in the BaTiO3 nanofilms. Polarization-electric field hysteresis loop indicated that the remanent polarization and the coercive field of the BaTiO3 nanofilms were 17 \u03bcC/cm2 and 175 kV/cm,respectively. Cross-sectional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrated that the BaTiO3 nanofilms contacted directly with the Pt nanowires,and the interface between them had some degree of waviness. Both selected area electron diffraction and high-resolution TEM images confirmed that the BaTiO3 nanofilms were the tetragonal phase with a perovskite structure. After post-annealing and crystallization of the BaTiO3 nanofilms,some Pt nanowires became branches at their ends due to the re-growth of the Pt nanowires. A suitable post-annealing temperature is the critical processing parameter of fabricating ferroelectric ordered nanostructures as considering a trade-off between the ordered metal nanowires within NAMs and the crystallinity of ferroelectric nanofilms.",

Studies on the lattice structures and defects of the films by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman scattering measurements were made to find a way to optimize the electrical properties. The microstructure and properties of film/electrode interfaces were also studied, from which the optimal film/electrode combinations for memory applications were proposed. The growth mechanism of ferroelectric thin films in an electric field was investigated both experimentally and theoretically, and a technique to control the growth texture by using an electrical field was developed.",

        "abstract": "As a lead-free piezoelectric material with potential application, 0.5Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT-0.5BCT) ceramics, which has a morphotropic phase boundary composition, deserves much attention due to its excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. BZT-0.5BCT lead-free piezoelectric film has been synthesized on a Si (100) substrate by Sol-Gel process. The topography of the film measured using an atomic force microscope and a scanning electron microscope shows that the surface of the prepared film is smooth, and the grain is in the shape of hemisphere with a diameter of 80\u2013100 nm. The film is 1.7 \u03bcm in thickness, with pores inside. Friction experiments show that the friction between the tip and the piezoelectric film is much larger than that between the tip and the SiO2 substrate, because of the existence of electrostatic force between the film and the silicon tip. However, the friction coefficients obtained are approximately equal. Nano-scratch experiments show that the BZT-0.5BCT film has a high normal carrying capacity, but a poor tangential wear resistance. The average elastic modulus of the film is 23.64 GPa \u00b1 5 GPa, and its hardness is 2.7\u20134 GPa, both being slightly lower than those of the bulk value in PZT ceramics.",

        "abstract": "Compared with ferroelectric oxides, organic ferroelectric materials are lightweight, flexible and easy to process. They are ideal for applications in the next-generation portable electronics. Here, we demonstrate the room-temperature growth of imidazolium perchlorate (C3N2H5ClO4) ferroelectric films on various substrates, including Pt-coated Si, quartz and, more importantly, on flexible and transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The films have a preferred (0 \u22121 \u22121) or (1 0 \u22121) orientation. The former shows a piezoelectric response comparable with the response of the Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 film. This is attributed to the smaller elastic constant of the film, which makes it less susceptible to substrate clamping. When grown on PET, the film is transparent and can be bent to radii of a few millimetres without affecting its ferroelectric properties. Our discovery may significantly promote the application of molecular ferroelectrics in flexible and transparent electronics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The multiferroic properties of BiFeO3-based ceramics were improved through optimizing their sintering method and doping with certain rare earth elements in pure BiFeO3. Some methods, especially liquid-phase sintering method has largely decreased the densities of oxygen vacancies and Fe2+ in BiFeO3-based ceramics, and thus their resistivity became high enough to measure the saturated polarization and the large piezoelectric d 33 coefficient under the high electric field of >150 kV/cm. Besides, multiferroic properties were improved through the rare earth elements\u2019 doping in pure BiFeO3. Magnetization commonly increases with the proportional increase of Nd, La, Sm and Dy contents up to ~30 %, while ferroelectric phase can transform to paraelectric phase at a certain proportion. An improved magnetoelectric coupling was often observed at ferroelectric phase with a relatively large proportion. Besides, an enhanced piezoelectric coefficient is expected in BiFeO3-based ceramics with morphotropic phase boundaries as they are already observed in thin epitaxial BiFeO3 films.",

The as-grown BFCO film allows its ferroelectric polarization switching under external electric field. With a 100-nm-radius tip contacting film surface, a stable bipolar resistive switching was observed through the conductive atomic force microscope. Furthermore, the resistive switching at negative bias was observed and its high/low current ratio is above 15 among a thousand of current versus voltage curves measured by the scanning tunneling microscope with a non-contacting nm-scale tip. It is argued that this transport mechanism is due to quantum tunneling, and the resistive switching in these junctions is because of ferroelectric switching.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The multiferroic (1\u2212x)BiFeO 3 \u2212xBi 0.5 K 0.5 TiO 3  (BFO\u2013xBKT) ceramic was prepared to investigate the dependence of its structural and electrical properties on BKT component. The ceramic processes a rhombohedral phase at 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.3 and a tetragonal phase at 0.5\u00a0\u2264\u00a0x\u00a0\u2264\u00a01.0 while it owns the coexistence of these two phases at x\u223c0.4, according to the XRD patterns and the corresponding simulation with the Reitveld method. Specifically, BFO\u20130.4BKT shows a saturated polarization of 65.8\u00a0\u03bcC/cm 2  and an enhanced piezoelectric  d  33  of 61\u00a0pC/N at room temperature which are much larger than those of other ceramics at x\u00a0=\u00a00\u20130.7. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature suggests a strong relaxor characteristic and a high Curie temperature of \u223c462\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, the poled BFO\u20130.4BKT ceramic shows radial dielectric resonances at 20\u2013300\u00a0\u00b0C due to the piezoelectric effect.",

        "abstract": "The short-circuit photocurrent (ISC) that can be reversed by polarization switch enhances with temperature increasing to 130\u2009\u00b0C in the epitaxial BiFeO3 thin film on SrTiO3 substrate. The La2/3Sr1/3MnO3/BiFeO3/indium tin oxide (In2O3:SnO2\u2009=\u20099:1) junction shows the current rectifying characteristic and the photovoltaic effect at 20\u2013130\u2009\u00b0C. Importantly, the ISC can be reversed by the polarization switch in this temperature range. More charge carriers are activated and the density of free electrons enhances with the increase in the temperature, which results in the decrease in the depletion layer width. As a result, the open-circuit voltage decreases 50% and the ISC increases from 180\u2009nA to 404\u2009nA with the increase in the temperature from 20\u2009\u00b0C to 130\u2009\u00b0C. This suggests that the corresponding sensors and devices can be used at a relatively high temperature.",

        "abstract": "Oxide ferroelectric ceramics and single crystals for flexible wearable device applications significantly suffer from the nature of hardness and brittleness due to their small maximum elastic strain and technological challenge in thinning to micrometer or nanometer scale. Although many oxide films are thin enough to be flexible, their rigid substrates restrain their piezoelectric d33 coefficient and limit their flexible performance. Here, the large-scale PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) films with SrRuO3 (SRO) buffered layer are grown on the 10 \u00b5m thick flexible mica substrate. An amplified longitudinal piezoelectric d33 of about 1200 pm V\u22121 is achieved in an SRO/PZT/Pt capacitor due to the direct mechanical coupling between PZT and flexible mica via the d31 piezoelectric tensor. The SRO/PZT/Pt capacitor shows a saturated polarization of \u224860 \u00b5C cm\u22122 and a dielectric tunability of \u224890%. Most importantly, the electric properties do not show obvious deterioration after repeatedly bending 10 000 times at a 2.2 mm radius. The flexible ferroelectric capacitors have potential applications in next-generation wearable devices and micro-electromechanical systems.",

Here, we report a kind of memristive abacus based on synaptic Ag-Ge-Se device, in which the memristive long-term potentiation and depression are caused by a chemically driven phase transformation. The growth and the rupture of conductive Ag\u2082Se dendrites are confirmed via in situ transmission electron microscopy. By detecting the change in memristive synaptic weight, the quantity of input signals applied onto the device can be \"counted\". This makes it possible to achieve the functions of abacus that is basically a counting frame. We demonstrate through experimental studies that this kind of memristive abacus can calculate decimal fractions in the light of the abacus algorithms. This approach opens up a new route to do decimal arithmetic in memristive devices without encoding binary-coded decimal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Severe restacking of single-atom-thick two-dimensional graphene and too long ion diffusion path in a thick three-dimensional porous graphene film are both main current problems limiting performance maximization of graphene as an energy storage material. Herein, we report an advance toward the design and fabrication of novel hierarchically porous N-doped graphene thin microsheets (PNGTMSs) with a honeycomb-like network structure allowing good dispersion of near-spherical Ni 2 P nanoflowers (NFs) by high-intensity compact ultrasound assisted technique. New insights into ultrasonic activation inducing a preferential self-assembly in a planar direction are proposed. High porosity and thin thickness of  2 P nanosheet-built NFs and their good dispersion as well as rich exposed interfaces, Ni 2 P-PNGTMSs exhibits specific capacitance of 1100\u202fF\u202fg \u22121  at 1.0\u202fA\u202fg \u22121 . Asymmetric solid-state device delivers an energy density of 39.8\u202fWh\u202fkg \u22121  (at 450.6\u202fW\u202fkg \u22121 ) and remarkable cycling stability with 97% capacitance retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. This work provides a convenient and scalable strategy for control over graphene nanostructures and their composites for highly enhanced energy storage.",

        "abstract": "0.67BiFeO3-0.33BaTiO3 multiferroic ceramics doped with x mol% MnO2 (x = 2\u201310) were synthesized by solid-state reaction. The formation of a perovskite phase with rhombohedral symmetry was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The average grain sizes were reduced from 0.80 \u03bcm to 0.50 \u03bcm as increasing the Mn-doped levels. Single crystalline nature of the grains was revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and electron diffraction patterns. Polar nano-sized ferroelectric domains with an average size of 9 nm randomly distributed in the ceramic samples were revealed by TEM images. Ferroelectric domain lamellae (71\u00b0 ferroelectric domains) with an average width of 5 nm were also observed. Vibrational modes were examined by Raman spectra, where only four Raman peaks at 272 cm\u22121 (E-4 mode), 496 cm\u22121 (A1-4 mode), 639 cm\u22121, and 1338 cm\u22121 were observed. The blue shifts in the E-4 and A1-4 Raman mode frequencies were interpreted by a spring oscillator model. The dieletric constants of the present ceramics as a function of the Mn-doped levels exhibited a V-typed curve. They were in the range of 350\u2013700 measured at 103 Hz, and the corresponding dielectric losses were in range of 0.43\u20130.96, approaching to 0.09 at 106 Hz.",

        "abstract": "Cubic bismuth pyrochlores in the \\(\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}\\)\u2013MgO\u2013\\(\\mathrm{Nb}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{5}\\) system have been investigated as promising dielectric materials due to their high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. Here, we report on the dielectric properties and microstructures of cubic pyrochlored \\(\\mathrm{Bi}_{1.5}\\mathrm{MgNb}_{1.5}\\mathrm{O}_{7}\\) (BMN) ceramic samples synthesized via solid-state reactions. The dielectric constant (measured at 1 MHz) was measured to be \\({\\sim}120\\) at room temperature, and the dielectric loss was as low as 0.001. X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that the BMN samples had a cubic pyrochlored structure, which was also confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. Raman spectrum revealed more than six vibrational models predicted for the ideal pyrochlore structure, indicating additional atomic displacements of the A and \\(\\mathrm{O}'\\) sites from the ideal atomic positions in the BMN samples. Structural modulations of the pyrochlore structure along the [110] and [121] directions were observed in SAED patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images. In addition, HR-TEM images also revealed that the grain boundaries (GBs) in the BMN samples were much clean, and no segregation or impure phase was observed forming at GBs. The high dielectric constants in the BMN samples were ascribed to the long-range ordered pyrochlore structures since the electric dipoles formed at the superstructural direction could be enhanced. The low dielectric loss was attributed to the existence of noncontaminated GBs in the BMN ceramics.",

The devices exhibit a large memory window of 13.27 V and a density of the trapped charges of 9.37 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122 at a working voltage of \u00b111 V. The microstructural observations by using high resolution transmission electron microscopy and the analysis on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the strong charge-trapping ability of Al2O3\u2013Cu2O composite should be ascribed to the occurrence of Cu2+, resulted by the inter-diffusion at the interface of Cu2O/Al2O3. Such an interesting composite layer has very attractive application in nonvolatile memory.",

The equivalent heat resistance of the system increases with the device dimensions scaled down because of the size-dependent electric and thermal conductivity and geometry configurations. The higher equivalent heat resistance by diminishing the cell sizes induces an enhanced self-heating effect of the filament. It promises lower operation voltage and heating power to trigger the thermally activated dissolution of the filament in RESET process. These results strengthen the advantage of filamentary memories in lateral and longitudinal scaling down technologies where less power consumption has long been urged. Our results also show the opposite dependence of the driven electric field on the linewidth and thickness of the device.",

        "abstract": "The roles of moisture in resistive switching (RS) devices are closely related to the RS mechanism. In principle, the nonpolar RS promises symmetric behaviors independent of the polarities of operating voltages. However, the effect of humidity on the RS characteristics of Pt/TiO2\u2212 x /Pt nonpolar cells is confirmed to be polarity-dependent. The positive electroforming threshold voltage decreases when humidity increases, whereas the negative one is unaffected. This asymmetric phenomenon can be attributed to the polarity-associated rule of current varying with humidity before electroforming. The voltage distribution in the device and then the electroforming threshold voltage are modified.",

Here we discovered cathode bubbles in Pt/TiO2\u2212x /Pt unipolar resistive switching cells when electroforming is implemented in a humid environment. But then these bubbles are absent when cells are operated in an anhydrous environment. The focused ion beam technique was used to observe the deformation of the cell induced by bubbles. These bubbles are deduced to be filled with H2 generated at the cathode by the reduction of protons from adsorbed water. Reduced oxides containing abundant oxygen vacancies facilitate the dissociation of adsorbed water and supply sufficient protons diffusing towards the cathode.",

At an applied voltage of \u00b111 V, the memory windows in the C\u2013V curves of the memory devices with 2, 3 and 4 nm SiO2 tunneling layers were about 4.18, 9.91 and 11.33 V, respectively. The anomaly in memory properties among the three memory devices was ascribed to the different back tunneling probabilities of trapped electrons in the charge-trapping dielectric (Al2O3)0.5(Cu2O)0.5 due to the different thicknesses of SiO2 tunneling layer.",

        "abstract": "Ferroelectric Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 (BLT) thin films were prepared on platinum coated silicon substrate by chemical solution deposition. The layered-perovskite phase was obtained by rapid thermal annealing the spin-on films at 650 or 700\u00b0C for 180 s. Scanning electron micrographs showed uniform surfaces composed of spherical grains. The grain size increased with increasing annealing temperature. The remanent polarization and coercive field of 650\u00b0C annealed film were 12.3 \u03bcC/cm2 and 48.9 kV/cm, respectively, and those of 700\u00b0C annealed films were 18.2 \u03bcC/cm2 and 51.1 kV/cm. BLT thin films showed little polarization fatigue under 250 kV/cm bipolar cycling at 50 kHz, while fatigue properties deteriorated with decreasing cycling field and frequency. At various frequencies from 1 Hz to 50 kHz, nonvolatile polarization Pnv showed nearly no degradation over an initial period of cycling, then decayed logarithmically with switching cycles. The onset of logarithmic decay of Pnv was found to increase linearly with cycling frequency. The cycling field dependence of fatigue characteristics was interpreted in terms of competition of charge trapping which blocks the domain switching and field-assisted detrapping of charged defects which set the locked domains free. Frequency dependent fatigue properties were discussed on the basis of drift and aggregation of oxygen vacancies. \u00a9 2000 American Institute of Physics.",

The formulas of adiabatic temperature or entropy change were deduced according to the flexoelectric effect and electrocaloric or elastocaloric effect. The results showed that flexoelectricity associated entropy change and adiabatic temperature change depend strongly on size, external stress and work temperature. The flexocaloric associated adiabatic temperature or entropy change increases with decreasing the thickness of truncated pyramids and increasing the external stress due to the increase of strain gradient. The flexocaloric entropy and adiabatic temperature changes are also enhanced with decreasing work temperature close to Tc.",

We mainly studied the elastic stiffness constants and piezoelectric tensors of these networks using their clamped-ion and relaxed-ion components. Our results show that both of these organic materials are piezoelectric along the armchair direction because of their noncentrosymmetric structures. The strain effects on the bandgaps of these monolayers have almost no effect on their piezoelectric performance. Additionally, the dynamic stabilities of the C9H3N3 and C6H3B3O3 monolayers were examined. Despite their low piezoelectric coefficients, the piezoelectricity in these two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks is promising for applications such as biocompatible nanoelectromechanical systems because they offer potential for enhanced biocompatibility when compared with inorganic materials.",

The ground state of the monolayer AgBiPSe was not purely ferroelectric since the out-plane ferroelectricity originated from the compensated ferrielectric state: the off-centering antiparallel displacements of Ag and Bi ions. The compensated ferrielectric ordering has superiority on reducing the depolarization field to stabilize the ferroelectricity. Furthermore, together with strong visible-light adsorption and suitable band edge alignments, we proposed the monolayer AgBiPSe as a visible-light photocatalyst for water-splitting as the out-plane polarization could enhance the electron-hole separation. Our results offer a new way to overcome the critical thickness limitation of nanoscale ferroelectrics. The out-plane ferroelectricity in monolayer AgBiPSe has great potential for developing various devices with desirable applications.",

However, the intrinsic semimetallic nature of the monolayer 1T\u2019-WTe2 limits their direct applications based on QSH effect. By first-principles density functional theoretical calculations, we demonstrate a phase transition from semimetal to QSH insulator under the uniaxial strains along a and b axis in monolayer 1T\u2019-WTe2. The electronic phase transition results from the geometric structure deformation upon the uniaxial strains. This suggests monolayer 1T\u2019-WTe2 as a promising material for application in strain-tunable topological quantum electronics.",

Here, we propose a competing mechanism to enhance the switching ratio by modifying the high-resistance state with extra inherent interfacial oxygen diffusion against what happens at the oxide/nitride interface. This is implemented in Pt/ZrO2/Ta2O5/TaN bilayer structures, where a resistance ratio above 104, about one to two orders of magnitude greater than that in Pt/Ta2O5/TaN monolayer structures, is achieved. This competing mechanism is further corroborated by the failed enhancement in the switching ratio when using an altered stacking arrangement of the two oxide layers.",

An indirect\u2013direct band gap transition occurs under compressive strains in ZnPS3, ZnPSe3, and CdPSe3, but CdPS3 always remains in an indirect band gap phase. The band gaps of MPX3 monolayers increase firstly and then decrease under compressive strain, while they only decrease in the case of tensile strain. In addition, we find that MPX3 monolayers are perfect substitutes for the unachievable two-dimensional MX (M = Zn, Cd; X = S, Se), due to their quite comparable electronic structures, such as their band gaps and effective masses. This indicates that MPX3 monolayers should be promising candidates in optoelectronic applications for tunable electronic structures by strain engineering.",

The effects of CZ-doping on the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the BNT\u2212BKT\u2212BT\u2212 x CZ system were systematically investigated. The polarization and strain behaviors indicated that the long-range ferroelectric order in the unmodified BNT\u2212BKT\u2212BT ceramics was disrupted by the increase of CZ-doping content, and correspondingly the depolarization temperature ( T  d ) shifted down from 109\u00a0\u00b0C to below room temperature. When  x u003e0.03, accompanied with the drastic decrease in the remnant polarization ( P  r ) and piezoelectric coefficient ( d  33 ), the electric-field-induced strain was enhanced significantly. A large unipolar strain of 0.35% under an applied electric field of 70\u00a0kV/cm ( S   max  / E  max =500\u00a0pm/V) was obtained in the BNT\u2212BKT\u2212BT\u22120.04CZ ceramics at room temperature, which was attributed to the reversible electric-field-induced phase transition between the relaxor and ferroelectric phases.",

The heterostructure shows a forward diode behavior at both the high resistance state and the low resistance state. The amplitude dependent rectifying features are attributed to the ferroelectric modulation effect on both the width of the depletion region and the height of the potential barrier at the KNN/LNO interface. By controlling the domain configurations using the writing voltage, the rectifying behaviors can be regulated and immediate states can be tuned. Our work shows the potential applications of KNN films in ferroelectric memristors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   La-modified Bi 1\u2212x La x FeO 3  (x = 0.15\u20130.40) and BaTiO 3 -modified (Bi 1\u2212y Ba y )(Fe 1\u2212y Ti y )O 3  (y = 0.10\u22120.33) multiferroic ceramics were synthesized via solid-state reactions, and their structural and vibrational properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD patterns reveal that the La-modified Bi 1\u2212x La x FeO 3  system exhibits an rhombohedral \u2013 orthorhombic structural transition at x = 0.40. The degree of rhombohedral distortion in the Bi 1\u2212x La x FeO 3  ceramics was decreased with increasing the La content, resulting in the disappearance of some Raman active modes (e.g.  A  1 -4,  E (TO1),  E (TO2),  E (TO6)). Similarly, in the BaTiO 3 -modified (Bi 1\u2212y Ba y )(Fe 1\u2212y Ti y )O 3  system, a composition-driven structural transition from rhombohedral ( R 3c) phase to cubic phase appeared at y = 0.30, indicating a morphotropic phase boundary between the rhombohedral and cubic phases. It is found that the Raman mode frequencies of the  A  1 -1,  A  1 -2,  A  1 -3 and  E (TO3) modes are slightly dependence of either the La content in Bi 1\u2212x La x FeO 3  system or the BaTiO 3  content in (Bi 1\u2212y Ba y )(Fe 1\u2212y Ti y )O 3  system, whereas the frequencies of the  E (TO8) and  E (TO9) Raman active modes are significantly dependent upon the modified compositions. Such compositional dependence of the Raman active mode frequencies are discussed and interpreted based on a spring oscillator model in combination with the structural phase transition, the degree of rhombohedral distortion, and the B\u2013O bond length in the BO 6  octahedron. The present results are useful for understanding the correlation between the structural and physical properties of the La-modified Bi 1\u2212x La x FeO 3  and the BaTiO 3 -modified (Bi 1\u2212y Ba y )(Fe 1\u2212y Ti y )O 3  ceramics.",

The pristine 1T-MX2 monolayers are semiconductors with nonmagnetic ground states, which can be transformed to ferromagnetic states by the approach of hole doping. For the unstrained monolayers, the spontaneous magnetization appears once above the critical hole density (1014 cm\u22122), where the p orbital of S or Se atoms contributes the most of the magnetic moment. As the tensile strains exceed 4%, the magnetic moments per hole of ZrS2 and HfS2 monolayers increase sharply to a saturated value with increasing hole density, implying obvious advantages over the unstrained monolayers. The phonon dispersion calculations for the strained ZrS2 and HfS2 monolayers indicate that they can keep the dynamical stability by hole doping. Furthermore, we propose that the fluorine atom modified ZrS2 monolayer could obtain stable ferromagnetism. The magnetism in hole doped 1T-MX2 (M = Zr, Hf; X = S, Se) monolayers has great potential for developing spintronic devices with desirable applications.",

It was found that the long-range ferroelectric order in the unmodified (BNT\u2013BT)\u2013LN ceramic was disrupted and transformed into the ergodic relaxor phase with the ST substitution, which was well demonstrated by the dramatic decrease in remnant polarization (Pr), coercive field (Ec), negative strain (Sneg) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33). However, the degradation of the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties was accompanied by a significant increase in the usable strain response. The critical composition (BNT\u2013BT\u20130.03ST)\u2013LN exhibited a maximum unipolar strain of ~0.44% and corresponding normalized strain, Smax/Emax of ~880 pm/V under a moderate field of 50 kV/cm at room temperature. This giant strain was associated with the coexistence of the ferroelectric and ergodic relaxor phases, which should be mainly attributed to the reversible electric-field-induced transition between the ergodic relaxor and ferroelectric phases. Furthermore, the large field-induced strain showed relatively good temperature stability; the Smax/Emax was as high as ~490 pm/V even at 120 \u00b0C. These findings indicated that the (BNT\u2013BT\u2013xST)\u2013LN system would be a suitable environmental-friendly candidate for actuator applications.This article is protected by copyright.

        "abstract": "The weak bond energy and large anisotropic domain wall energy induce many special characteristics of the domain nucleation, growth, and polarization switch in triglycine sulfate (TGS) and imidazolium perchlorate (IM), two typical molecular ferroelectrics. Their domain nucleation and polarization switch are rather slower than those of conventional oxide ferroelectrics, which may be due to the weaker bond energy of hydrogen bond or van der Waals bond than that of ionic bond. These chemical bonds dominate the elastic energy, with the latter being an important component of domain wall energy and playing an important role in domain nucleation and domain growth. The ratio of anisotropic domain wall energy to Gibbs free energy is large in TGS and IM, which allows a favorable domain shape and a special domain evolution under a certain electric field. Therefore, this study not only sheds light on the physical nature but also indicates the application direction for molecular ferroelectrics.",

The BTS film was prepared on Pt(1\u00a01\u00a01)/Ti/SiO 2 /Si(1\u00a00\u00a00) substrate by means of the sol\u2013gel method. The results show that the as-prepared BTS thin film has a perovskite structure with preferred (1\u00a01\u00a00) orientation; a highly converse piezoelectric coefficient of  d  33  \u223c135\u00a0pm/V; and dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss of \u223c2000 and \u223c0.04, respectively, indicating that this new type of lead-free BTS film can probably be used to replace the conventional BaSrTiO 3  and PbZrTiO 3  films.",

The size of the Y2O3 trilobal prisms could be modulated from micro- to submicroscale with the increase of pH value. The as-formed products via the hydrothermal process, monoclinic yttrium oxide hydroxide nitrate, Y 4O(OH)9(NO3), could transform to cubic Y 2O3 with the same morphology after annealing at high temperatures. The formation mechanism for the Y4(OH) 9(NO3) trilobal prisms has been proposed. Under hydrothermal conditions, the synergistic effect of Y-type aggregates of primary Y4O(OH)9(NO3) nanorods and sequent preferential of different crystal planes resulted in the formation of trilobal prisms. \u00a9 2005 American Chemical Society.",

        "abstract": "Amino acid esters are a group of structurally diverse natural products with distinct activities. Some are synthesized through an inter-molecular esterification step catalysed by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). In bacteria, the formation of the intra-molecular ester bond is usually catalysed by a thioesterase domain of NRPS. However, the mechanism by which fungal NRPSs perform this process remains unclear. Herein, by targeted gene disruption in  and heterologous expression in , we show that two NRPSs, ApmA and ApmB, are sufficient for the synthesis of an amino acid ester, asperphenamate. Using the heterologous expression system, we identified that ApmA, with a reductase domain, rarely generates dipeptidyl alcohol. In contrast, ApmB was determined to not only catalyse inter-molecular ester bond formation but also accept the linear dipeptidyl precursor into the NRPS chain. The mechanism described here provides an approach for the synthesis of new small molecules with NRPS as the catalyst. Our study reveals for the first time a two-module NRPS system for the formation of amino acid esters in nature.",

By genome-wide deletions of epigenetic regulators in entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii, unexpected activations of orphan secondary metabolite genes have been found upon the disruption of a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) gene Hat1. This led to the characterization of 11 new natural products, including eight isocoumarin derivatives meromusides A\u2013H and two nonribosomal peptides meromutides A and B. Therefore, disruption of HAT represents a new approach to mine chemical diversity from fungi.",

The characteristics of roasted products in the beneficiation by direct reduction roasting with dephosphorization agent Na2CO3 was also analyzed using the XRD and SEM. It showed that phosphorus-bearing minerals mainly existed as crandallite (CaAl3(OH)6(HPO4)(PO4)) and vauxite (FeAl2(PO4)2OH \u00b7 6H2O), which embedded in the fissures and holes of oolitic iron ore particles, or existed as the form of isomorphism interfusing in the ore mechanically. Separation of phosphorus and iron can be realized by direct reduction roasting (adding dephosphorizing agent Na2CO3) and magnetic separation. Phosphorus can be removed in two ways: part of the phosphorus was separated with iron and existed in the gangue mineral, which could be removed by grinding and magnetic separation. The other part of the phosphorus-bearing minerals was transferred into the soluble phosphorus by reacting with the dephosphorization agent Na2CO3. Then the phosphorus content of the reduced iron products was reduced.",

Method: Sixteen ICR mice, weighing 20 \u223c 25 g each, were randomly divided into the N2 O4-intoxicated group (n = 8) and control group (n = 8). Mice in N2 O4-intoxicated group were put into a 120L toxicant exposure cabinet. 100 \u03bcl liquis N2O4 was quantitatively injected into the cabinet by a micro-syringe. The concentration of N2O4 was kept at 70 g/m3 for 15 minutes. Serum samples from the two groups were collected and proteomics were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). Results: Irritation symptoms of respiratory tract and eyes, such as drooling, emesis, cyanosis, dyspnoea, restlessness, muscular vibrating and extremity convultion, occurred in mice of N2O4 - intoxicated group. Typical symptom, such as spasm, lockjaw, asphyxia, spitting foam and urinary and fecal incontinence occurred in some mice. Comparing to the control group, the expression of proteins with molecular weight 3668, 3870, 4728, 4900 and 5815 was up-regulated, and the expression of protein with molecular weight 13619 and 13816 was down-regulated in N2O4-intoxicated group (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Proteomics changes significantly in N2O4-intoxicated group, which can be used to study pathophysiology of N2O4 intoxication.",

To solve this problem,we adopted a new concept of network control domain and specify the process of gen- eration and combination of domain in our study of ad hoc networking. On this base,dynamic distributed network man- agement architecture is adopted and topology generation based on control domain is proposed too. Simulation output shows that,generation of control domain is commendably adapted to mobility of node in ad hoc network and demon- strates a good performance in domain partition. Topology achieved on the basis of control domain shows better accu- racy and reliability.",

        "abstract": "The MANET (mobile Ad hoc network) is a new mobile wireless communication network. Comparing with the other communication network, the unique properties of MANET add the difficulties and challenges to the network management. Recently, the network management on MANET is on the initial stage and more accurate standards are not defined and in addition, some existing problems such as unidirectional links and relative mobility of nodes are ignored. Hence, a clustering algorithm based on graph with the token mechanism and node minimum identifier applied to hierarchical network management on MANET is proposed, as well as the amelioration to MIB (management information base) suggested. The algorithm puts the special unidirectional links and relative mobility into consideration, improves the flexibility and scalability in network management, and suggests an idea to the network management as well.",

        "abstract": "Cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored membrane protein that is highly conserved in mammalian species. PrPc has the characteristics of adhesive molecules and is thought to play a role in cell adhesion and membrane signaling. Here we investigated the possible role of PrPc in the process of invasiveness and metastasis in gastric cancers. PrPc was found to be highly expressed in metastatic gastric cancers compared to nonmetastatic ones by immunohistochemical staining. PrPc significantly promoted the adhesive, invasive, and in vivo metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901 and MKN45. PrPc also increased promoter activity and the expression of MMP11 by activating phosphorylated ErK1/2 in gastric cancer cells. MEK inhibitor PD98059 and MMP11 antibody (Ab) significantly inhibited in vitro invasive and in vivo metastatic abilities induced by PrPc. N-terminal fragment (amino acid 24-90) was suggested to be an indispensable region for signal transduction and invasion-promoting function of PrPc. Taken together, the present work revealed a novel function of PrPc that the existence of N-terminal region of PrPc could promote the invasive and metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cells at least partially through activation of MEK/ERK pathway and consequent transactivation of MMP11.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of malignancy-related mortality worldwide, and drug resistance hampered the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy. To better understand the molecular mechanism causing drug resistance, we previously established an isogenic pair of doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant gastric cancer cell lines, SGC7901 and SGC7901/ADR cells. Here, we investigated how modulation of CUTL1 activity affects the response of gastric cancer to frequently used chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we demonstrated that CUTL1 transcription activity was significantly reduced in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Furthermore, decreased CUTL1 expression was strongly associated with intrinsic drug resistance in human gastric cancer tissues and could be used as a poor prognosis biomarker. Both gain-of-function (by overexpression of active CUTL1) and loss-of-function (by CUTL1-specific shRNA knockdown) studies showed that increased CUTL1 activity significantly enhanced cell sensitivity to drugs and led to increased apoptosis, whereas decreased CUTL1 expression dramatically reduced cell sensitivity to drugs and thus fewer apoptoses. Importantly, modulation of CUTL1 activity resulted in altered sensitivity to multiple drugs. In vivo mouse studies indicated that overexpression of active CUTL1 significantly resulted in increased cancer tissue response to chemotherapy and therefore inhibited growth, whereas knockdown of CUTL1 conferred resistance to chemotherapy. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that CUTL1 activity is inversely associated with drug resistance and thus is an attractive therapeutic target to modulate multidrug resistance in gastric cancer.",

However, it still remains unclear whether CO2 could be used as an alternative for air cholangiography in such patients.To investigate the effect of CO2 cholangiogram on post-ERCP complications.Prospective, randomized controlled study.Tertiary care referral center.36 patients with Bismuth type II, III or IV were randomized into CO2 group or iodine contrast group (control group).Cholangiography was performed by injection of either CO2 or iodine contrast through a sphincterotome. One or two metal stents were placed.Post-ERCP complications, length of hospital stay after ERCP, 1-month and 1-year mortality.There was no significant difference in age, gender, symptoms, liver function tests, type of tumor origin and Bismuth type between patients in CO2 and contrast groups (p > 0.05). Compared with one-stent placement, more volume of CO2 and longer operation time were observed when performing two-stent placement (both p < 0.05). The rate of cholangitis in CO2 group was significantly lower than that in control group (5.6% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.04). After ERCP, mean hospital stay time was shorter in CO2 group compared with control (p < 0.05). The difference of 1-month and 1-year mortality between two groups was not significant (both p > 0.05).CO2 cholangiogram could be a safe method to visualize intrahepatic bile duct with low incidence of post-ERCP cholangitis, which could be considered for the patients with malignant hilar obstruction.",

        "abstract": "Bowel preparation is closely linked to the quality of colonoscopy. We investigated whether delivery of instructions, via a social media app, increases the quality of colonoscopy by improving adequacy of bowel preparation.We performed a prospective study, at 3 endoscopic centers in China, of 770 colonoscopy outpatients (18-80 years old) with convenient access to Wechat (a widely used mobile social media app), from May through November 2014. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that received standard education along with delivery of interactive information via Wechat (n=387) or standard education (controls, n=383). The primary outcome was proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation (Ottawa score of <6). Secondary outcomes included rates of adenoma detection and cecal intubation, cecal intubation time, rates of incomplete compliance with instructions, and patient willingness to repeat bowel preparation.Demographic features were comparable between the groups. A higher proportion of patients in the group that received social media instruction had adequate bowel preparation than the control group (82.2% vs 69.5%, P<.001). Among patients with successful colonoscopies, the group that received social media instruction had lower mean total and segmental Ottawa scores (P<.05). A higher proportion of patients receiving social media instruction also had cecal intubation (97.2% vs 93.2% in controls, P=.014) and were found to have adenomas (18.6% vs 12.0% in controls, P=.012).Instruction via a mobile social media app, in conjunction with regular instruction, increases subjective measures of adequacy of bowel preparation. Use of the app significantly increased the proportion of patients with successful cecal intubation and in whom adenomas were detected, indicating increased quality of colonoscopy.",

We have previously reported that the mitotic index of 22.22% of small gastric GISTs exceeded 5 per 50 high-power fields and recommended that all small gastric GISTs should be resected once diagnosed. The aim of the present study is to compare the safety and outcomes of endoscopic and open resection of small gastric GISTs. From May 2010 to March 2014, a total of 90 small gastric GIST patients were enrolled in the present study, including 40 patients who underwent surgical resection and 50 patients who underwent endoscopic resection. The clinicopathological characteristics, resection-related factors, and clinical outcomes were recorded and analyzed. The clinicopathological characteristics were comparable between the two groups except for tumor location and DOG-1 expression. Compared with the surgical resection group, the operation time was shorter (P = .000), blood loss was less (P = .000), pain intensity was lower (P < .05), duration of first flatus and defecation was shorter (P < .05), and medical cost of hospitalization was lower (P = .027) in the endoscopic resection group. The complications and postoperative hospital stay were comparable between the two groups. No in situ recurrence or liver metastasis was observed during follow-up. Endoscopic resection of small gastric GISTs is safe and feasible compared with surgical resection, although perforation could not be totally avoided during and after resection. The clinical outcome of endoscopic resection is also favorable. ",

Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups and fed a normal chow diet (control group, CON), a high-fat diet (HFD group) or a HFD supplemented with fish oil (FO group) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of feeding, the body weight and the ratio of perinephric and epididymal fat weight to body weight were significantly higher in the HFD group compared with the CON group. The supplement of fish oil rich in \u03c9-3PUFAs only slightly reduced the HFD-induced obesity but remarkably ameliorated HFD-induced dyslipidemia, sexual hormones disorder, testicle lesions and germ cell apoptosis. Fish oil supplementation restored the expression of steroid synthesis associated genes in HFD fed mouse and flattened the HFD-induced oscillations in circadian genes' expression. Fish oil supplementation prevented HFD-induced male mouse reproductive dysfunction and modified the rhythmic expression of testosterone synthesis related genes.",

Male C57BL/6\u2009J mice were either fed a normal diet (CON) or a high-fat high-fructose diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, and starting from week 12, HFD-fed animals in PLP group were orally given PLP. PLP administration significantly reduced fasting blood glucose level and ameliorated glucose intolerance. Differentially expressed genes involved in FOXO signaling pathway and in vitamin B12 (VB12) transport were identified between HFD and PLP group. HFD decreased the phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio and S-adenosyl methionine to S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio, which were recovered by PLP treatment. Plasma VB12 levels in HFD group was lower than CON or PLP group, and PLP stimulated the proliferation of gut bacteria in genus Porphyromonas with capability of VB12 synthesis. In conclusion, PLP administration improved insulin resistance via modifying hepatic phospholipids metabolism and rescuing insulin signaling transduction.",

        "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease in developed countries. Recent studies indicated that the modification of gut microbiota plays an important role in the progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated consumption of fish oil or perilla oil rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protects against NAFLD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we adopted 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing technique to investigate the impacts of fish oil and perilla oil on gut microbiomes modification in rats with high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced NAFLD. Both fish oil and perilla oil ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In comparison with the low-fat control diet, HFD feeding significantly reduced the relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in the gut, which was slightly reversed by either fish oil or perilla oil. Additionally, fish oil and perilla oil consumption abrogated the elevated abundance of Prevotella and Escherichia in the gut from HFD fed animals. Interestingly, the relative abundance of antiobese Akkermansia was remarkably increased only in animals fed fish oil compared with HFD group. In conclusion, compared with fish oil, perilla oil has similar but slightly weaker potency against HFD-induced NAFLD and gut dysbiosis.",

        "abstract": "Our previous studies have found that fish oil rich in \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3 PUFA) protects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. This study was aimed to explore the effects of fish oil on high fat diet (HFD)-induced circadian bile composition chaos. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups, a control group (CON), a HFD group and a fish oil (FO) group, which were fed a normal chow diet, a HFD, and a HFD supplemented with FO, respectively for 12 weeks. At the end of the experiment, liver tissue, blood and bile samples were processed at 12-h intervals with the first one at zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) and the second at zeitgeber time 12 (ZT12). Metabolites in bile were determined using UPLC-QTOF-MS, screened using multivariate statistical analysis, and analyzed using KEGG database and Metaboanalyst. The expression levels of key proteins in bile acid metabolism were examined using western blot. Results of biochemical analysis and H&E staining illustrated that feeding of HFD induced NAFLD, which was ameliorated in FO group. The bile content of each group at ZT0 (CON, HFD, or FO group) was respectively higher than that at ZT12 (P<.05). The metabolic pathway analysis of differential metabolites showed that these differences were correlated with amino acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and primary bile acid synthesis at ZT0. FO supplement could modify bile composition, which was related to the influence of its \u03c9-3 PUFA on liver metabolism. \u03c9-3 PUFA may also regulate the circadian rhythm of bile metabolism.",

Sudan I derivate-gelatin immunogen has been synthesized using the mixed anhydride method. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the immunogen in rabbits. The purified antibody was immobilised on the nitrocellulose membrane as the test reagent. When the sample was added into the test device, the possible Sudan I in samples and the gold-labeled Sudan I-BSA conjugate which was added subsequently into the test device will competitively capture the immobilised antibody. The more Sudan I present in the samples, the more effective competition reaction with gold-labeled Sudan I-BSA occurred. A visible red dot shows a negative result in the read-out zone, and vice versa. Results showed that the detection limit was 0.8 g/mL in chili powder. Quantitative analysis of Sudan I could be achieved between 0.2 g/mL and 1.0 g/mL. Compared with HPLC methods, the results showed a good correlation with a square of correlation coefficient of 0.941. Low cross-reactivity was found among other Sudan dyes. The analysis could be completed in shorter time, suitable for rapid detect Sudan I residue in food and preliminary screening detections for abundant samples. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

The present study assesses the efficacy of paenibacterin in inhibiting  Listeria monocytogenes  biofilm formation and removing established biofilm. Paenibacterin at 1.7\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (less than compoundu0027s minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) and higher concentrations (3.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 6.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) were tested. Concentrations greater than the lipopeptideu0027s MIC significantly inhibited the formation of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  biofilm on polystyrene microtiter plates at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Paenibacterin also was added to established biofilm and its structure or removal was monitored by fluorescence microscopes after appropriate staining. Results show that paenibacterin could eliminate established biofilms formed at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h, whereas it could not disrupt stronger biofilms formed at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h. Motility of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  is important for its ability to form biofilm. Swimming assay confirmed that paenibacterin suppressed  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  motility. Real time quantitative PCR data revealed that paenibacterin down-regulated  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  critical biofilm-associated genes,  prfA ,  agrA ,  flaA ,  fliG  and  flgE . These results suggested the feasibility of using paenibacterin in food processing environments to control  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  growth and biofilm formation, or even for removal of some established biofilms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract    Listeria monocytogenes  ( L.\u00a0monocytogenes ) is a well-known food-borne pathogen that causes systemic listeriosis. Its biofilm-forming ability is known to be important for its antimicrobial resistance and persistence. Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) is the highest component of tea polyphenols in tea extracts and has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. In this study, the efficacys of EGCG to inhibit biofilm formation and hemolytic activity of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  were determined. EGCG at 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, 40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (less than compoundu0027s minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (1 MIC) were tested. Crystal violet staining showed that sub-MIC and MIC of EGCG could significantly reduce the biofilm formation by  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  on polystyrene microtiter plates at three temperatures (15\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C). EGCG reduced the sessile cell numbers present in biofilm at those temperatures. EGCG also significantly inhibited hemolytic activity of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  as measured by sheep red blood cells. Real time PCR assay was used to investigate the relative gene expression of  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and revealed that EGCG down-regulated virulence genes ( inlA  and  hly ), SOS response genes ( recA  and  yneA ) and quorum sensing gene ( agrA ). These results suggested the feasibility of using EGCG in food industry to control  L.\u00a0monocytogenes  biofilm formation.",

        "abstract": "The reported data indicate that oleic acid (OA) decreases cholesterol absorption. To explore the underlying mechanisms, the effects of OA on the expression of cholesterol transport-related proteins (NPC1L1, ABCG5/8, ACAT2, MTP) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were studied in CaCo-2 enterocytes by incubating CaCo-2 cells with taurocholate micelles or taurocholate micelles containing different concentrations of OA (0.25-1.0 mM). We show that OA effectively induces XBP1 mRNA splicing, a key component of the UPR signaling, and the expression of BiP and mature ATF6 proteins in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the UPR. Interestingly, OA decreases NPC1L1 expression in a dose-dependent manner while it has no effects on ABCG5 and MTP mRNA level or SREBP-2, ABCG8, and ACAT2 protein level. In CaCo-2 cells treated with 1.0 mM OA, both the NPC1L1 mRNA level and the NPC1L1 protein expression in brush-border membrane fractions were decreased by 39% and 37%, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.01). A dose of 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), a positive control for ER stress induction, also decreases NPC1L1 mRNA and protein expression by 27% and 23%, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, 4-phenyl-butyric acid, an UPR inhibitor, blocks OA- and DTT-induced reduction on NPC1L1 mRNA and protein levels. The results suggest that OA down-regulates NPC1L1 mRNA and protein expression via the induction of the UPR, which may play an important role in reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption.",

        "abstract": "Clear differences of biological function between very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) types I and II have not been defined. The purpose of this study is to characterize VLDLR activities during cell proliferation and migration using adenocarcinoma SGC7901 cells.Western blotting was used to test protein expression. Cell proliferation or migration was analyzed by MTT or Transwell chambers respectively. The mRNA expression was tested by RT-PCR. Reporter assay was to test the transcription activity.The cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) became well differentiated and had a gradually attenuated cell proliferation and migration, accompanied by a significant decrease in type II VLDLR expression. These cells also had decreased amount of beta-catenin, indicating a decreased stability of beta-catenin. In addition, the mRNA expression of both matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was also decreased. On the contrary, cells treated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) had an increase in type II VLDLR expression, whereas the beta-catenin was increased. This was accompanied by increased cell proliferation and migration and by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression. Finally, the transfection of SGC7901 cells with type II VLDLR recombinant DNA induced the cell proliferation and migration as well as the activation of beta-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) signaling. However, type I VLDLR transfection reduced beta-catenin stability and decreased cell proliferation and migration.These data strongly suggest that type II VLDLR activity is positively associated with significant change of tumor cell proliferation and migration, via the beta-catenin/TCF signaling.",

The topologies that characterize the interaction among the leaders and the followers are directed graphs. Necessary and sufficient criteria which guarantee the control objectives are established for both stationary leaders U+0028 regulation case U+0029 and dynamic leaders U+0028 dynamic tracking case U+0029 based protocols. The final states of all the followers are exclusively determined by the initial values of the leaders and the topology structures. In the regulation case, all the followers converge into the convex hull spanned by the leaders, while in the dynamic tracking case, not only the positions of the followers converge into the convex hull but also the velocities of the followers converge into the velocity convex hull of the leaders. Finally, all the theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.",

To deal with the soft fault, a fuzzy adaptive filtering algorithm is proposed. By monitoring the residual and the residual rate, the observation quality gene is obtained by the fuzzy logic control system. The local filter is adaptively adjusted on-line, and the filtering divergence arising from the gradual changing fault is prevented, and then the residual chi-square test is assisted to detect faults. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively diagnose suddenly changing faults and soft faults online, and ensure system precision during failure phase, and the system reliability is improved. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

On day 7, 10, 15, 18, 21, 24, 28, 31, and 35, the mice were sacrificed; blood was collected into tubes from the eyes, serum samples for clinical biochemistry assays and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy were attained after centrifugation, and the contents of serum fatty acids were detected with GC-MS. Sections of livers were taken and stored in formalin solution for histological assessments. No species differences existed in all these groups. The contents of C16:1, C18:1, C22:6 were significantly different between HFD groups and the corresponding controls; meanwhile, the proportion of fatty acids, especially the monounsaturated degree, the polyunsaturated degree, changed significantly and regularly (P<0.05). Thus the three unsaturated fatty acids C16:1, C18:1, C22:6 and the monounsaturated/polyunsaturated unsaturated degrees may be as potential biomarkers of hyperlipidemia.",

        "abstract": "Mice lacking wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) display male reproductive defects including smaller testes, subfertility and spermatogenesis defects at the round- and elongating-spermatid stages. However the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities remain unclear. Here we examined the proteome and phosphoproteome of testes from Wip1-knockout mice using a quantitative proteomic approach. From a total of 6872 proteins and 4280 phosphorylation sites identified, 58 proteins and 159 phosphorylation sites were found to be differentially regulated compared to wild type mice. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that these regulated proteins and phosphosites were mainly involved in adherens/tight junctions, apoptosis, inflammatory response, spermatogenesis, sperm motility, and cytoskeletal assembly and depolymerization. Wip1-knockout mice showed decreased expression of junction-associated proteins (occludin, ZO-1, and N-cadherin) and impaired integrity of the blood-testis barrier. In addition, Wip1 deficiency was associated with elevated levels of cytokines and germ cell apoptosis in the testis. These results suggest that proinflammatory cytokines may impair the blood-testis barrier dynamics by decreasing the expression of junction-associated proteins, which could lead to subfertility and spermatogenesis defects. Collectively, these findings help to explain the low reproductive function caused by Wip1 deletion and provide novel insights into our understanding of causes of male infertility.",

        "title": "Highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgene knockin at the H11 locus in pigs",
        "abstract": "Pig models are often favored over rodent models due to their clinical relevance and high similarity to human physiology and anatomy1,2,3. Traditionally, transgenic pigs have been produced by integrating a gene sequence or a transgene into the genome in a random manner, in which the transgene can be inserted anywhere in the genome4. Random integration of a transgene often leads to unstable phenotypes, gene silencing and unpredictable gene expression, and in some cases, this process is mutagenic. For site-specific gene insertion, homologous recombination (HR) was used in the past to engineer the porcine fibroblasts5,6,7, and the correctly targeted fibroblasts were then used in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to generate transgenic pigs. This approach is inefficient due to low HR efficiency, laborious, and time consuming. Transposon system such as Sleeping Beauty has been used in the past few years to generate transgenic pigs with RMCE (recombinase-mediated cassette exchange) acceptor sites inserted at a so-call safe-harbor genomic locus8,9. These \u201cRMCE-ready\u201d transgenic pigs can then be used to insert a transgene of interest through RMCE. Such transposon method requires pre-engineering of the pig genome to contain RMCE acceptor locus and an extensive characterization of the locus being transcriptionally active, therefore is cumbersome. In addition, the copy number of the insertions cannot be controlled and transgenic founders often contain multiple monomeric insertions which will need further breeding to segregate. As a result, methods that allow one-step, site-specific, and single copy transgene insertion would greatly enhance the generation of optimal transgenic pig models.Site-specific nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) have recently been developed for effective targeted gene editing10,11. Cas9 endonuclease from the Streptococcus pyogenes type II CRISPR/Cas system can be engineered to produce targeted genome modification under the guidance of a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) with simple base-pair complementarities with a target genomic DNA sequence11. Due to its high efficiency and ease in building constructs, CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used in humans, mice, rabbits, monkeys and several other species10,12. CRISPR/Cas9 generates site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that can be repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), through which genes of interest can be brought to the target sites and inserted. In 2014, Zhou and colleagues generated the first CRISPR/Cas9 knockout pig model13, and afterwards several other groups also achieved gene knockout in pigs by using CRISPR/Cas914,15,16. As of now, knockin pigs using CRISPR/Cas9 have never been reported.Here, we show that site-specific gene knockin can be efficiently achieved using the CRISPR/Cas9 system with transgenes as large as over 9kb. Our method involves generating gene modified primary pig fetal fibroblasts first and then using SCNT to generate transgenic pigs. We also describe the identification of a safe harbor, transcriptionally active locus in the pig genome, the pH11 locus. A combination of the features of the site-specific targeting of CRISPR/Cas9 and the transcriptionally active pH11 locus offers an efficient and rapid method for precise gene addition in pigs. In addition, our study confirms that a gene driven by a ubiquitous promoter and inserted into the pH11 locus can be expressed ubiquitously in pig cells, embryos and transgenic pigs.",

        "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been widely applied in humans, mice, and some domestic animals to cure human infertility, or produce genetically superior or genetically engineered animals. However, the production efficiency of ICSI in pigs remains quite low. In this study, we developed a new sperm pretreatment method to improve production efficiency of ICSI in pigs. Experiment 1 revealed that pretreating porcine sperm with 2.5 mg/ml lipase before ICSI operation, not only can reduce the adhesion between sperm and the injection pipette without adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in the operating medium, but also significantly improve male pronuclei (MPN) formation rate (55.56% vs. 40.00% (0 mg/ml), 42.59% (5.0 mg/ml), 40.00% (10.0 mg/ml), P < 0.05) and enhance developmental competence of ICSI embryos (26.03% vs. 10.87% (0 mg/ml), 10.00% (5.0 mg/ml), 10.13% (10.0 mg/ml), P < 0.05). Experiment 2 showed that this method has a higher MPN formation rate (50.47% vs. 30.78%, P < 0.05) and blastocyst rate (18.81% vs. 7.41%, P < 0.05) than the PVP method, and was better than the Triton X-100 treatment method (50.47% vs. 46.23%, 18.81% vs. 12.75%). Therefore, pretreating porcine sperm with 2.5 mg/ml lipase before ICSI operation is highly recommended, instead of adding PVP in the operating medium. ",

The foot and mouth disease virus 2A (F2A)\u2011mediated polycistronic system possesses several advantages, and the present study developed a novel multi\u2011transgenic minipig model associated with diabetes using this system. The tissue\u2011specific polycistronic system used in the present study consisted of two expression cassettes, separated by an insulator: (i) 11\u2011\u03b2\u2011hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11\u03b2\u2011HSD1), driven by the porcine liver\u2011specific apolipoprotein E promoter; (ii) human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), linked to the furin digested site and F\u20112A, driven by the porcine pancreas\u2011specific insulin promoter. In the present study, porcine fetal fibroblasts were transfected with this vector. Following somatic cell nuclear transfer using 10 cell clones and the transplantation of 1,459 embryos in total, three Landrace x Yorkshire surrogates became pregnant and delivered three Wuzhishan piglets. Genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that the piglets were multi\u2011transgenic. Reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR confirmed that 11\u03b2\u2011HSD1 transcription was upregulated in the targeted liver. Similarly, hIAPP and CHOP were expressed at high levels, compared with the control (P<0.05 and P<0.01) in the pancreas, consistent with the western blotting and immunohistochemistry results. The primary results also showed that overexpression of 11\u03b2\u2011HSD1 in the liver increased the liver fat lipid parameters; and the levels of hIAPP and CHOP in the pancreatic islet cells, leading to delayed \u03b2\u2011cell development and apoptosis. This novel tissue\u2011specific polycistronic system offers a promising starting point for efficiently mimicking multigenic metabolic disease.",

        "abstract": "Recently, AB-type tetradymites have developed into a hot topic in physical and material research fields, where the A and B atoms represent V and VI group elements, respectively. In this study, in situ angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on BiTeSe, BiSbTeSe, and SbTeSe tetradymites under high pressure. BiTeSe transforms from a layered rhombohedral structure (phase I) into 7-fold monoclinic (phase II) and body-centered tetragonal (phase IV) structures at about 8.0 and 14.3 GPa, respectively, without an 8-fold monoclinic structure (phase III) similar to that in BiTe. Thus, the compression behavior of BiTeSe is the same as that of BiSe, which could also be obtained from first-principles calculations and in situ high-pressure electrical resistance measurements. Under high pressure, BiSbTeSe and SbTeSe undergo similar structural phase transitions to BiTeSe, which indicates that the compression process of tellurides can be modulated by doping Se in Te sites. According to these high-pressure investigations of AB-type tetradymites, the decrease of the B-site atomic radius shrinks the stable pressure range of phase III and expands that of phase II, whereas the decrease of the A-site atomic radius induces a different effect, i.e. expanding the stable pressure range of phase III and shrinking that of phase II. The influence of the atomic radius on the compression process of tetradymites is closely related to the chemical composition and the atom arrangement in the quintuple layer.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   The high-pressure crystal structure and transporting properties of bismuthinite (Bi 2 S 3 ) have been studied with a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The present experimental results show that the structure of orthorhombic Bi 2 S 3  stably exists in the experimental pressure range up to around 55\u00a0GPa. Upon compression, the X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are dominated by broad Bragg features and seemingly pressure-induced structural amorphization or disorder occurs. However, by analyzing the XRD data obtained during the decompression cycle we suggest that the broad Bragg diffraction peaks under high pressure could be due to the nonhydrostatic conditions or crystal structural defects. To construct the correlation between the structural variation and the physical properties of Bi 2 S 3 , the transporting properties of Bi 2 S 3  were investigated under high pressure. With increasing pressure, the resistance value decreases sharply below 5\u00a0GPa and then decreases gently as the pressure further increasing. There is an obvious inflection point at about 5\u00a0GPa in the relationships of log ( R ) versus pressure. We speculate that the observed electrical variation is resulted from the pressure-induced second-order isostructural phase transition according to the reported literature. Temperature dependence of the resistance indicated that a pressure-induced semiconductor\u00a0\u2192\u00a0metal transition in Bi 2 S 3  happens at around 20\u00a0GPa. The present high pressure resistance measurement indicated that high pressure could help to improve the thermoelectric properties.",

In this work, the in situ high-pressure angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction experiments and the first-principle calculations were performed on BiOCl, in order to explore the crystal and electronic structure evolution processes upon compression. At 15.1 GPa, BiOCl undergoes a tetragonal to tetragonal isostructural phase transition and then completely transforms into a high-pressure tetragonal phase at 22.1 GPa, which adopts the same crystal structure as that of the low-pressure tetragonal phase.

        "abstract": "Recently, A2B3-type tetradymites have developed into a hot topic in physical and material research fields, where the A and B atoms represent V and VI group elements, respectively. In this study, in situ angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on Bi2Te2Se, BiSbTeSe2, and Sb2Te2Se tetradymites under high pressure. Bi2Te2Se transforms from a layered rhombohedral structure (phase I) into 7-fold monoclinic (phase II) and body-centered tetragonal (phase IV) structures at about 8.0 and 14.3 GPa, respectively, without an 8-fold monoclinic structure (phase III) similar to that in Bi2Te3. Thus, the compression behavior of Bi2Te2Se is the same as that of Bi2Se3, which could also be obtained from first-principles calculations and in situ high-pressure electrical resistance measurements. Under high pressure, BiSbTeSe2 and Sb2Te2Se undergo similar structural phase transitions to Bi2Te2Se, which indicates that the compression process of tellurides can be modulated by doping Se in Te sites. According to these high-pressure investigations of A2B3-type tetradymites, the decrease of the B-site atomic radius shrinks the stable pressure range of phase III and expands that of phase II, whereas the decrease of the A-site atomic radius induces a different effect, i.e. expanding the stable pressure range of phase III and shrinking that of phase II. The influence of the atomic radius on the compression process of tetradymites is closely related to the chemical composition and the atom arrangement in the quintuple layer.",

Three-step structure-activity relationship exploration led to promising compounds 19e and 19h with unique chemical structure and binding mode from the other third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

        "title": "Theoretical studies on FGFR isoform selectivity of FGFR1/FGFR4 inhibitors by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations.",
        "abstract": "The activation and overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are highly correlated with a variety of cancers. Most small molecule inhibitors of FGFRs selectively target FGFR1-3, but not FGFR4. Hence, designing highly selective inhibitors towards FGFR4 remains a great challenge because FGFR4 and FGFR1 have a high sequence identity. Recently, two small molecule inhibitors of FGFRs, ponatinib and AZD4547, have attracted huge attention. Ponatinib, a type II inhibitor, has high affinity towards FGFR1/4 isoforms, but AZD4547, a type I inhibitor of FGFR1, displays much reduced inhibition toward FGFR4. In this study, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy calculations and umbrella sampling (US) simulations were carried out to reveal the principle of the binding preference of ponatinib and AZD4547 towards FGFR4/FGFR1. The results provided by MM/GBSA illustrate that ponatinib has similar binding affinities to FGFR4 and FGFR1, while AZD4547 has much stronger binding affinity to FGFR1 than to FGFR4. A comparison of the individual energy terms suggests that the selectivity of AZD4547 towards FGFR1 versus FGFR4 is primarily controlled by the variation of the van der Waals interactions. The US simulations reveal that the PMF profile of FGFR1/AZD4547 has more peaks and valleys compared with that of FGFR4/AZD4547, suggesting that the dissociation process of AZD4547 from FGFR1 are easily trapped into local minima. Moreover, it is observed that FGFR1/AZD4547 has much higher PMF depth than FGFR4/AZD4547, implying that it is more difficult for AZD4547 to escape from FGFR1 than from FGFR4. The physical principles provided by this study extend our understanding of the binding mechanisms and provide valuable guidance for the rational design of FGFR isoform selective inhibitors.",

The natural product curcumin is reported to inhibit the TLR4 co-receptor, MD2 (myeloid differentiation protein 2), but its low in\u00a0vivo bioavailability limits its therapeutic potential. We developed new curcumin analogs (MACs) with removal of the \u03b2-diketone moiety and substituted residues in benzene rings, and identify these as potential MD2 inhibitors with improved inhibition potency and stability over that of curcumin. Specifically, MAC 17 and 28 showed the highest anti-inflammatory activity, with >90% inhibition of LPS-stimulated cytokine secretion from macrophages, and protected against LPS-induced acute lung injury and sepsis. The MACs inhibited the TLR4-MD2 signaling complex through competition with LPS for binding on MD2, likely at Arg. Our findings indicated that MAC 17 and 28 are promising candidates for future development as therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases with an endotoxin etiology.",

        "abstract": "Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), an essential adapter protein used by toll-like receptors (TLR), is a promising target molecule for the treatment of respiratory inflammatory diseases. Previous studies explored the activities of novel 2-amino-4-phenylthiazole analogue (6) in inflammation-induced cancer, and identified the analogue as an inhibitor of MyD88 toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain dimerization. Here, we describe the synthesis of 47 new analogues by modifying different sites on this lead compound and assessed their anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse primary peritoneal macrophages (MPMs). The most promising compound, 15d, was found to effectively interact with MyD88 protein and prevented formation of the MyD88 homodimeric complex. Furthermore, 15d showed in\u00a0vivo anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-caused model of acute lung injury. This work provides new candidates as MyD88 inhibitors to combat inflammation diseases.",

Most of the obtained compounds exhibited improved water solubility as a hydrochloride salt compared to lead molecule 8f. The most active compound 7a was effective in reducing the Wet/Dry ratio in the lungs and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Meanwhile, 7a also inhibited mRNA expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and VCAM-1, in Beas-2B cells after Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. These results suggest that 7a could be therapeutically beneficial for use as an anti-inflammatory agent in the clinical treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). ",

Targeting myeloid differentiation protein 2/toll-like receptor 4 (MD2-TLR4) complex may be a promising way to treat Gram-negative bacterial-induced inflammatory disorders. In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of 3-(indol-5-yl)-indazoles, which were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities in macrophages. Among the analogues generated, the promising 3-(indol-5-yl)-indazole analogue 22m inhibited lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in macrophages with IC50 values of 0.89 and 0.53 \u03bcM, respectively. Compound 22m was then identified as MD2-TLR4 antagonist in suppressing LPS-induced inflammatory responses. In vivo administration of 22m significantly inhibited macrophage infiltration and ameliorated histopathological changes in lung tissues of LPS-challenged mice. Our studies have identified a new 3-(indol-5-yl)-indazole, 22m, as potent MD2-TLR4 inhibitor and lay the groundwork for the future drug development of anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of ALI.",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among solid tumors and has shown an increasing trend year by year. Thus, there is an urgent need for the discovery of new anticancer drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In recent years, it has been reported that the compound HO-3867, a novel analog of the natural product curcumin, showed antitumor activity with low toxicity. However, the underlying mechanism of this compound's attack on cancer cells is not very clear. In the present study, it was found that HO-3867 showed good antitumor activity at the concentration of 2\u2009\u03bcmol/l in PANC-1 and BXPC-3 cells. Importantly, it was also found that HO-3867 treatment significantly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human pancreatic cancer cell lines, inducing PANC-1 and BXPC-3 cells. Co-treatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, partially abrogated HO-3867-induced cell apoptosis. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and endoplasmic reticulum stress indicated a downstream event of ROS generation in mediating the anticancer effect of the HO-3867. In addition, independent of the ROS pathway, direct STAT3 inhibition was observed in HO-3867-induced cell apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this work suggest that both the ROS-dependent ER stress and STAT3 pathways were implicated in the cell apoptosis induced by the novel compound HO-3867.",

        "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been found to be able to reduce inflammatory response. However, it is still unclear whether EGFR inhibition can prevent ALI. This study aimed to validate the EGFR's role in ALI and investigated the effects of EGFR inhibition on lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI in rats. In vitro, both pharmacological inhibitors (AG1478 and 451) and si-RNA silencing of EGFR significantly inhibited LPS-induced EGFR signaling activation and inflammatory response in human lung epithelial cells or macrophages. Mechanistically, LPS induced EGFR activation via TLR4 and c-Src signaling. In vivo, rat model with ALI induced by intratracheal instillation of LPS was treated by oral administration of AG1478 and 451. It was observed that AG1478 and 451 blocked the activation of EGFR signaling in lung tissue and reduced the LPS-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, inflammatory gene expression, and lung injuries. This study demonstrates that TLR4/c-Src-dependent EGFR signaling plays an important role in LPS-induced ALI, and that EGFR may be a potential target in treating ALI.",

In this study, the anti-cancer effects and potential mechanisms of LicA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were studied. LicA decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in NSCLC cells. LicA inhibited lung cancer cells growth by blocking cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition and inducing apoptosis. LicA treatment decreased the expression of MDM2, Cyclin B1, Cdc2 and Cdc25C in H460 and A549 cancer cell lines. In addition, LicA induced caspase-3 activation and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, which displayed features of apoptotic signals. Furthermore, LicA increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related proteins, such as p-EIF2\u03b1 and ATF4. These data provide evidence that LicA has the potential to be used in the treatment of lung cancer.",

Novel 2-sulfonylindoles were recently shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. Here, we synthesized 31 compounds which contained 2-sulfonylindole structure. The compounds 8a, 9g, 9h and 9k exhibited dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity in\u00a0vitro. Structural-activity relationship analysis revealed that the introduction of sulfonyl group in indole nucleus may be successful to obtain new anti-inflammatory structures and leads. The compounds 9h and 9k also decreased liposaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA expression, both in\u00a0vitro and in an in\u00a0vivo model of ALI. Furthermore, the compounds 9h and 9k at a high dose (20\u202fmg/kg) significantly protected against LPS-induced ALI in mice. These results show that compounds 9h and 9k could be a promising lead structure for the treatment of ALI.",

        "abstract": "Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for gastric cancer (GC). However, the occurrence of resistance to 5-FU treatment poses a major problem for its clinical efficacy. In this study, we found that the NF\u03baB-signaling pathway can mediate 5-FU resistance in GC cells. We developed a 5-FU-resistant GC cell line named SGCR/5-FU and found that the 5-FU-induced resistance increased cytosolic I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and promoted NF\u03baB nuclear translocation in GC cells. These findings were further confirmed by the activation of the NF\u03baB survival-signaling pathway in clinical specimens. Curcumin, a natural compound, can reverse 5-FU resistance and inhibits proliferation in GC cells by downregulating the NF\u03baB-signaling pathway. Moreover, it can also decrease the expression level of TNF\u03b1 messenger RNA. Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis results showed that the combination of curcumin and 5-FU caused synergistic inhibition of growth and induction of potent apoptosis in the resistant cancer cell lines in vitro. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the combination of 5-FU and curcumin could be further developed as a potential therapy for human GC.",

Preliminary results showed that a vast majority of compounds tested in this study could effectively suppress LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6. Structure-activity relationships of the compounds were discussed. Compounds 5a27 and 5a28 showed the most potent anti-inflammatory activities and had higher structural stability and orally bioavailability than curcumin in\u00a0vitro. Mechanistically, they inhibited the activation of macrophages via the blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. In\u00a0vivo, 5a27 and 5a28 markedly alleviated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). The wet/dry ratio of lungs was significantly normalized by the active compounds, which was consistent with the suppression of neutrophil infiltration and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these results present a new series of curcumin analogs as promising anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of ALI.",

        "abstract": "Acute inflammatory diseases, including acute lung injury and sepsis, remain the most common life-threatening illness in intensive care units worldwide. Cinnamamide has been incorporated in several synthetic compounds with therapeutic potentials including anti-inflammatory properties. However, the possible mechanism and direct molecular target of cinnamamides for their anti-inflammatory effects were rarely investigated. In this study, we synthesized a series of cinnamamides and evaluated their anti-inflammatory activities. The most active compound, 2i, was found to block LPS-induced MD2/TLR4 pro-inflammatory signaling activation in vitro and to attenuate LPS-caused sepsis and acute lung injury in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that 2i exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by directly targeting and binding MD2 in Arg90 and Tyr102 residues and inhibiting MD2/TLR4 complex formation. Taken together, this work presents a novel MD2 inhibitor, 2i, which has the potential to be developed as a candidate for ...",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Curcumin is a well-known natural product with anticancer ability, however, its poor bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles have limited its application in anticancer therapy. Previously, we reported that L48H37, a novel analog of curcumin with higher bioavailability, ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation, but the anticancer effect of L48H37 is still unknown. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of L48H37 in human lung cancer cells. Our results show that L48H37 decreases lung cancer cell growth and colony formation. These alterations were mediated through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. After L48H37 treatment, ER stress-related proteins were increased, and the expression of p-STAT3 was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. L48H37 also induced the accumulation of ROS in lung cancer cells, and pretreatment with NAC could fully reverse L48H37-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase. Blocking ROS was able to reverse L48H37-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Finally, we show that L48H37 inhibits the growth of lung cancer xenografts without exhibiting toxicity. Treatment of mice bearing human lung cancer xenografts with L48H37 was also associated with indices of ER stress activation. In summary, our results provide evidence for a novel anti-tumor candidate for the treatment of lung cancer.",

This study presents a convergent strategy for the first total synthesis of ( R)-, ( S)-, and (\u00b1)-sanjuanolide (1). The key step for synthesizing ( R)- and ( S)-1 was a Corey-Bakshi-Shibata enantioselective carbonyl reduction to construct the C-2\u2033 configuration. ( R)-1 efficiently inhibited the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while ( S)-1 produced no significant anti-inflammatory effect. ( R)-1 also effectively inhibited the mRNA expression of several inflammatory cytokines after the LPS challenge in vitro. The synthesis and biological properties of these compounds have confirmed ( R)-sanjuanolide and (\u00b1)-sanjuanolide as promising new leads for developing anti-inflammatory agents.",

Based on this methodology, twenty nine novel indole-dithiocarbamate compounds were prepared in moderate to excellent yields at room temperature. All compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity. Most of the compounds exhibited high potency on inhibiting the releasing of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Four of them were found to suppress in vitro cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner with IC values in the nanomolar range. Additionally, 3-methyl-1H-indol-1-yl dimethylcarbamodithioate (3o) effectively ameliorated histopathological changes of lung tissues and attenuated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in\u00a0vivo. These data suggest that the new indole-dithiocarbamate derivatives could be particularly useful for further pharmaceutical development for the treatment of ALI.",

In particular, DR-selective ligands that can eliminate side effects associated with dopamine D receptor (DR) therapeutics have been validated. However, the high homology in signaling pathways and the sequence similarity between DR and DR have rendered the development of DR-selective ligands challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of piperazine-phthalimide bitopic ligands based on a fragment-based and molecular docking inspired design. Compound  was identified as the most selective DR ligand among these bitopic ligands. Its selectivity was improved compared to reference compounds  and  by 9- and 2-fold, respectively, and it was 21-fold more potent than compound . Molecular docking demonstrated that the orientation of Leu and Phe and the packing at the junction of helices may affect the specificity for DR over DR. Functional evaluation revealed that DR-selective ligand  displayed a subpicomolar agonist activity at DR with a 199-fold increase in potency compared to quinpirole. These results may be useful for the fragment-based design of bitopic compounds as selective DR ligands.",

Cell cycle analysis showed that  6c  inhibited cell proliferation due to G2/M arrest. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that  6c  dose-dependently increased the level of Bax and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2, to induce cancer cell apoptosis.

        "abstract": "Novel efficacious treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with less toxicity has yet to emerge. Genomic analysis of RMS has reported that the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR4 is highly expressed and frequently mutated in the tumor tissue. The V550E/L and N535D/K mutations of FGFR4 in RMS can lead to strong drug resistance to almost all of the type-I inhibitors. Previous report has demonstrated the type-II inhibitor ponatinib is the most potentially effective agent for RMS but still hard to starboard the V550E/L mutants. In this case, an ensemble of molecular modeling strategies was employed to theoretically uncover the resistance mechanisms. The binding free energy calculation results predicted by various strategies show that the V550E/L rather than N535D/K mutations indeed weaken the binding affinity of ponatinib, which are in good agreement with the experimental observations. Subsequently, the energy decomposition analysis mapped a knock-on effect on the diverse energy components of some key residues. Moreover, it is of great importance to report that there is an effective channel for type-II inhibitors sliding along the A-loop to prevent FGFR4 from phosphorylation and activation. Our results provide new insight into drug binding process and guide the development of effective inhibitors to surmount drug resistance in RMS.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is an important risk factor for heart failure. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this current study was to examine the role of EGFR in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we observed that both Ang II and EGF could increase the phospohorylation of EGFR and protein kinase B (AKT)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and then induce cell hypertrophy in H9c2 cells. Both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic silencing significantly reduced Ang II-induced EGFR signalling pathway activation, hypertrophic marker overexpression, and cell hypertrophy. In addition, our results showed that Ang II-induced EGFR activation is mediated by c-Src phosphorylation. In vivo, Ang II treatment significantly led to cardiac remodelling including cardiac hypertrophy, disorganization and fibrosis, accompanied by the activation of EGFR signalling pathway in the heart tissues, while all these molecular and pathological alterations were attenuated by the oral administration with EGFR inhibitors. In conclusion, the c-Src-dependent EGFR activation may play an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and inhibition of EGFR by specific molecules may be an effective strategy for the treatment of Ang II-associated cardiac diseases.",

        "abstract": "The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is a proven therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, D3R-selective ligands that can eliminate side effects associated with dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) therapeutics have been validated. However, the high homology in signaling pathways and the sequence similarity between D2R and D3R have rendered the development of D3R-selective ligands challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of piperazine-phthalimide bitopic ligands based on a fragment-based and molecular docking inspired design. Compound 9i was identified as the most selective D3R ligand among these bitopic ligands. Its selectivity was improved compared to reference compounds 1 and 2 by 9- and 2-fold, respectively, and it was 21-fold more potent than compound 2. Molecular docking demonstrated that the orientation of Leu2.64 and Phe7.39 and the packing at the junction of helices may affect the specificity for D3R over D2R. Functional evaluation revealed that D3R-selective ligand 9i displayed a subpicomolar agonist activity at D3R with a 199-fold increase in potency compared to quinpirole. These results may be useful for the fragment-based design of bitopic compounds as selective D3R ligands.",

Herein, we loaded a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence dye (CySCOOH) onto the surface of PEGylated graphene oxide (GO) via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking to increase the NIR absorbance of GO. The PA imaging proved that PEGylated GO-CysCOOH (GO-PEG-CysCOOH) significantly enhances the PA signal in the tumor site compared with free GO-PEG. We then utilized the strong optical absorbance of GO-PEG-CySCOOH in the NIR region for  photothermal therapy, achieving efficient tumor ablation after intravenous injection of GO-PEG-CySCOOH and low-power laser irradiation on the tumor. Our results indicate that this graphene-based nanocomposite can be developed as a promising contrast agent for PA imaging and a thermal agent for imaging guided photothermal therapy.",

In this study, we strategically constructed a near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dye by introducing a rigid cyclohexenyl ring to the hepta-methine chain to obtain a heptamethine dye CySCOOH with high fluorescence intensity and good stability. By covalent conjugation of CySCOOH onto human serum albumin (HSA), the as-prepared HSA@CySCOOH nanoplatform is highly efficient for NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic/thermal multi-modality imaging and photothermal tumor ablation. The theranostic capability of HSA@CySCOOH was systematically evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Most intriguingly, complete tumor elimination was achieved by intravenous injection of HSA@ CySCOOH (CySCOOH, 1 mg kg(-1); 808 nm, 1.0 W cm(-2) for 5 min) into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, with no weight loss, noticeable toxicity, or tumor recurrence being observed. This as-prepared protein-based nanotheranostics exhibits high water dispersibility, no off target cytotoxicity, and good biodegradability and biocompatibility, thus facilitating its clinical translation to cancer photothermal theranostics.",

Based on the well-defined biochemical changes for apoptosis, a rich assortment of probes and approaches have been developed for molecular imaging of apoptosis with various imaging modalities. Among these imaging techniques, nuclear imaging (including single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography) remains the premier clinical method owing to their high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, the corresponding radiopharmaceuticals have been a major focus, and some of them like  99m Tc-Annexin V,  18 F-ML-10,  18 F-CP18, and  18 F-ICMT-11 are currently under clinical investigations in Phase I/II or Phase II/III clinical trials on a wide scope of diseases. In this review, we summarize these radiopharmaceuticals that have been widely used in clinical trials and elaborate them in terms of radiosynthesis, pharmacokinetics and dosimetry, and their applications in different clinical stages. We also explore the unique features required to qualify a desirable radiopharmaceutical for imaging apoptosis in clinical practice. Particularly, a perspective of the impact of these clinical efforts, namely, apoptosis imaging as predictive and prognostic markers, early-response indicators and surrogate endpoints, is also the highlight of this review.",

This nanosensor exhibited upconversion luminescence turn-on and ratiometric detection ability of DCP with satisfactory response speed (within 40\u00a0s) and a detection limit of 0.21\u00a0\u03bcM. Under a 980\u00a0nm laser excitation, the blue emission of UCNPs was quenched due to the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) between Rhodol and Tm 3+  doped UCNPs, while the presence of DCP led to the suspension of LRET, as a result, significant fluorescence recovery of UCNPs could be observed. Furthermore, we have developed paper-based devices for the point-of-care detection of DCP with naked eyes, both the color change and the blue fluorescence recovery could inform us the presence of DCP. Such convenient detection strategies have the potential to provide us early warnings of the existence possibilities of any risks from OP nerve agents and thus ensure us of our public security.",

        "abstract": "The imaging of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the first defense against primary tumor metastasis, has been considered as an important strategy for noninvasive tracking tumor metastasis in clinics. In this study, we developed an imaging contrast system based on fluorescent dye-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) that integrate near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent and photoacoustic (PA) imaging modalities for efficient SLN mapping. By balancing the ratio of dye and nanoparticles for simultaneous optimization of dual-modality imaging (NIR and PA), the dye encapsulated MSNP platform was set up to generate both a moderate NIR emission and PA signals simultaneously. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of the relevance between optical and PA properties were discovered. Subsequently, dual-modality imaging was achieved to visualize tumor draining SLNs up to 2 weeks in a 4T1 tumor metastatic model. Obvious differences in uptake rate and contrast between metastatic and normal SLNs were observed both in vivo and ex vivo. Based on all these imaging data, it was demonstrated that the dye-loaded MSNPs allow detection of regional lymph nodes in vivo with time-domain NIR fluorescent and PA imaging methods efficiently.",

Owing to the role of integrins, non-invasive imaging of \u03b1v\u03b23 expression in diseased tissue will be of great benefit in directing adjuvant therapy for cancer patients. To this end,  peptide based  for optical imaging have emerged as a real-time, sensitive, and noninvasive approach for visualization, localization, and measurement of cancer in vivo. With the advantages of optical imaging such as sensitivity, cost effectiveness, and non-invasion, the past decades have witnessed the rapid development of integrin- targeted optical  and its wide applications in cancer research. In this review, we present and introduce numerous approaches by the term RGD motif based optical imaging probes with respect to their probe design strategies and applications. Additionally, a variety of labels such as QDs, UCLs and near-infrared fluorochrome used in these optical imaging  are also discussed.",

Jujube witches' broom disease is a destructive phytoplasma disease of Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). To elucidate the influence of phytoplasma on host photosynthetic, carbohydrate and energy metabolisms, four types of jujube tissues showing disease symptoms with different severity were investigated at the structural, physiological and molecular levels. qRT-PCR and HPLC results showed that the down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis and the lower contents of chlorophyll in diseased leaves. This clearly inhibited the light-harvesting and photosystem II activity of photosynthesis; however, overexpression of genes related to starch, sucrose and glucose synthesis led to higher contents of these carbohydrates. Meanwhile, transmission electron microscopy images revealed that dense amounts of phytoplasmas accumulated in the sieve elements of diseased petiole phloem, and the structure of the grana and stroma lamellae of chloroplasts in the diseased leaves was destroyed. Phytoplasma infection inhibited photosynthesis and led to abnormal carbohydrate accumulation in the diseased leaves. Furtherly, comparative metabolite analysis indicated that phytoplasma infection also stimulated amino acids and energy metabolisms of the diseased leaves. Continually inhibiting the photosynthetic process and stimulating carbohydrate and energy metabolisms of diseased trees may exhaust their nutrients. Our results highlight the importance of changing host metabolisms during the pathogenic process.",

        "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing is fundamentally altering traditional phylogenetic classifications. While the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III system based on chloroplast sequences has opened up a new era of angiosperm molecular classification, the use of nuclear genome sequences is more helpful for a precise phylogenetic analysis. However, such attempts have so far been applied to only a very limited number of angiosperm plant families. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of 25 plant species with well assembled genome sequences representing 19 angiosperm families and one gymnosperm family (as out group) using 390 orthologous genes. Our results strongly support the moving of Rhamnaceae to order Rosales from Rhamnales, abolishing Rhamnales, and establishing the new order Malpighiales in the APG III system. Our data also showed some characteristics inconsistent with the APG III classification and provided a reinterpretation of phylogeny for some of the families involved. We propose that Malpighiales should be placed in Malvids, not Fabids. The four monocot species representing four families were clustered together, indicating that monocot is a natural taxon. In summary, our results support almost all the APGIII treatments of the orders involved in this study and provided some surprising reinterpretations at levels beyond order.",

Phytoplasmas are significant prokaryotic pathogens, associated with more than 1000 plant diseases. Jujube witches\u2019 broom disease (JWB) is a typical phytoplasma disease, caused by \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma ziziphi\u2019. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are highly universal signal transduction modules and play crucial roles in regulating innate immune responses in plants. Thus, in the current study, systematical expression profiles of 10 ZjMPK and 4 ZjMPKK genes were conducted in plantlets with JWB disease, plantlets recovered from JWB disease, the tissues showing different disease symptoms, and resistant/susceptible cultivars infected by JWB phytoplasma. We found that most ZjMPK and ZjMKK genes exhibited significant up- or down-regulation expression under phytoplasma infection, but the top three differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were ZjMPK2, ZjMKK2 and ZjMKK4, which showed the biggest times of gene\u2019s significant difference expression in all materials. Based on STRING database analysis, ZjMKK2 and ZjMPK2 were involved in the same plant-pathogen interaction pathway, and Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that ZjMKK2 could interact with ZjMPK2. Finally, we deduced a pathway of jujube MAPK cascades which response to \u2018Candidatus Phytoplasma ziziphi\u2019 infection. Our study presents the first gene-family-wide investigation on the systematical expression analysis of MAPK and MAPKK genes in Chinese jujube under phytoplasma infection. These results provide valuable information for the further research on the signaling pathway of phytoplasma infection in Chinese jujube.",

The Bragg wavelength shift due to pressure and temperature can be enhanced by the polymer packaged by about 31.5 times for pressure and 7.7 times for temperature. The experiment results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. The sensitivity enhancement is due to the driving effect of the polymer substance. The `structured' grating exhibits no significant chirp.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   This work explores the applicability of clay-polyelectrolyte based hybrid thin films to develop fouling resistant membrane surfaces for wastewater treatment applications. Clay nanoplatelets were layered on a commercial polyethersulfone membrane in conjunction with two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes via the aqueous-based layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique. These hybrid nanostructured membranes showed a high degree of fouling resistance as compared to other commercial membranes and the pure polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) membranes, when tested against an electrocoagulation-treated high strength wastewater. With the deposition of just 2.25 quadlayers, the clay-PEM (c\u2010PEM) membranes demonstrated good anti-fouling properties. On crosslinking the polyelectrolytes, the c\u2010PEM hybrid membranes showed higher reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value and enhanced fouling resistance as compared to their uncrosslinked counterparts, the pure PEM membranes (both uncross linked and crosslinked) and the bare membrane. However, the high fouling resistance of the c\u2010PEM membranes was attained at the cost of compromising the high initial flux value of the underlying membrane. Several possible optimization strategies have therefore been suggested in this paper, which can potentially increase the flux of the modified membranes. This work, for the first time, demonstrated an attempt to evaluate the performance of clay-polyelectrolyte nanocomposite membranes against a real wastewater effluent.",

The results show that the IL (3\u2013sulfonic acid)\u2013propyltriethylammonium chloroironinate [HO3S\u2013(CH2)3\u2013NEt3]Cl\u2013[FeCl3]x (molar fraction of FeCl3, x = 0.67) was an efficient catalyst for the esterification reaction. The yield of glycerol triacetate and its content were greater than 98 % when reacted under reflux for 4 h. It was observed that a synergistic effect of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites enhanced the catalytic performance of IL. The reusability of IL was good. After six reaction cycles, the glycerol triacetate yield and concentration were still greater than 98 %. Likewise, the Bronsted\u2013Lewis acidic IL was an efficient catalyst for esterification reactions of high boiling points alcohols with acetic acid.",

IL 1-(3-sulfonic acid)-propyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorozincinate [HO3S-(CH2)3-mim]Cl-ZnCl2 (x=0.67) exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, which is attributed to the appropriate acidity, the synergistic effect originating from its double acidic sites and the promoting effect of water on the formation and transfer of protons. The Lewis acidic strength of IL played an important role in improving IL catalytic performance. A 100% conversion of 2-butene with 85.8% selectivity for C8-alkylate was obtained under mild reaction conditions. The IL reusability was good because its alkyl sulfonic acid group being tethered covalently, its anion [Zn2Cl5]\u2212 inertia to the active hydrogen, and its insolubility in the product. IL [HO3S-(CH2)3-mim]Cl-ZnCl2 had potential applicability in the benzene alkylation reaction with olefins and halohydrocarbons.",

For this problem, a method for distributed satellite networks based on standby nodes is presented in this paper. Firstly, it can establish a main path and confirm main nodes according to max-throughput principle in this method. Secondly, it can establish standby nodes set for the main path according to point-to-point transmission model, and build more standby paths by selecting nodes form the set. Finally, it can transmit data packets by the standby paths, if the node is failure in main path. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that this method improves greatly the reliability of the end-to-end transmission. And it also improves the distributed satellite networks robustness and anti-destroying ability.",

        "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most frequent of all oral cancers, is a type of highly malignant tumors with a high capacity to invade locally and form distant metastases. An increasing number of studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating cancer metastasis and invasion. In the present study, we detected the expression of miR-221 in two highly metastatic OSCC cell lines and two OSCC cell lines that are less metastatic using quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results indicate that miR-221 is upregulated in highly metastatic OSCC cell lines. Then, miR-221 expression was knocked down by transfection with miR-221 inhibitor, and UM1 cell migration and invasion were assessed using transwell migration and invasion assays. The results indicate that inhibition of miR-221 suppressed migration and invasion of UM1 cells. Furthermore, methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-221. Additionally, MBD2 silencing could partly reverse the effect of miR-221 on cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, downregulation of miR-221 inhibits cell migration and invasion at least partially through targeting MBD2 in the human OSCC cell line UM1.",

However, the expression and potential role of iASPP in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) have not been addressed. In our study, we detected iASPP expression in OTSCC by immunohistochemistry. iASPP expression is up-regulated in OTSCC tissues. Moreover, in clinical pathology specimens, we found that increased iASPP expression correlates with poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Using multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) and flow cytometry, we demonstrated that iASPP down-regulation arrests OTSCC cells at the G0/G1 phase, induces OTSCC cell apoptosis and inhibits OTSCC cell proliferation. These results indicate that iASPP plays a significant role in the progression of OTSCC and may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target for OTSCC patients.",

It remains unclear whether miRNA-221 influences the resistance of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells to Adriamycin. We therefore investigated the role of miR-221 in the sensitivity of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells to chemotherapy. Tca8113 and UM2 cells were treated with different concentrations of Adriamycin. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed miR-221 upregulation after Adriamycin treatment of Tca8113 and UM2 cells. By using miR-221 inhibitor mimics, we found that depleting cells of miR-221 increases the sensitivity of the cells to Adriamycin. The expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), a target of miR-221, was decreased in cells treated with Adriamycin. TIMP3 depletion reversed the effect of a miR-221 inhibitor mimics on cell survival rates and apoptosis. Together, these results reveal that silencing of miR-221 enhances the sensitivity of human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells to Adriamycin through upregulation of TIMP3 expression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract   Hyperspectral image classification is an important task in remote sensing image analysis. Traditional machine learning techniques are difficult to deal with hyperspectral images directly, because hyperspectral images have too many redundant spectral channels. In this paper we propose a novel method for hyperspectral image classification, by which spectral and spatial features are jointly exploited from hyperspectral images. Firstly, considering the local similarity in spatial domain, we employ a large spatial window to get image blocks from hyperspectral image Secondly, each spectral channel of the image block is filtered to extract their spatial and spectral features, after that the features are merged by convolutional layers. Finally, the fully-connected layers are used to get the classification result. Comparing with other state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed method pays more attention to the correlation of spatial neighborhood by using a large spatial window in the network. In addition, we combine the proposed network with the traditional support vector machine (SVM) classifier to improve the performance of hyperspectral image classification. Moreover, an adaptive method of the spatial window sizes selection is proposed in this paper. Experimental results conducted on the AVIRIS and ROSIS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "abstract": "The ultimate receiver of image and video is human visual system (HVS). It is an important problem in the domain of image and video processing that how to establish visual information representation model meeting the HVS perception property. In this study, authors give theory analysis and experiment results to prove that l_1 norm-based entropy of primitive (EoP) is superior to the l_0 norm-based EoP for the monocular cue in image quality assessment. By developing the concept of mutual information of primitive (MIP) as the binocular cue, an l_1 EoP-based stereoscopic image quality assessment metric is proposed. With EoP as monocular cue and MIP as binocular cue, the relative entropy between the original stereoscopic image and the distorted one is explored to predict the quality score with support vector regression. To avoid destroying imageu0027s structured information, the structured EoP (SEoP) is further explored to measure the stereoscopic image information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the stereoscopic image quality assessment algorithm with SEoP as monocular cue and MIP as binocular cue outperforms many state-of-the-art ones.",
